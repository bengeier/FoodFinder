{"text":"Super awful experience?Would give zero star if I can. The manager thats in on Jan 09 2017 is very rude and extremely arrogant. We were told to book our reservation time at 7:45. Got here at 7:35 just to be sure that we are not late due the bad weather. Got seated at 7:45but in between 7:45 and 8:05, a good 20min passed nobody came to ask if we would like anything to drink or offered water. We patiently waited for other customer to show up so we can get the table started. Which they're already 25min late, we are really hungry and we asked the manager if the restaurant have anything against customer that are late for their reservation? Are we just gonna sat here an hour wait for other people, if they don't come in? He said yes, and when we ask if we could sit with other people or form a new table? He said: As you can see we are full (actually is not), if you want to sit at the wait area, feel free! So far 8:30, no food in my plate yet."}
{"text":"Brutal.  Horrible right from the start.  Poor bookings (rude), rushed in to seat, eat and get out!  They were placing the next guests settings before we finished desert.  Calgary has a plethora of restaurants to enjoy, try elsewhere, you will be much happier with any other experience."}
{"text":"I've been humming and hawing about writing this review for a couple of reasons I know people love this place and two I had super high expectations.

We went here for a birthday a couple of weeks ago. The chef at the other table was doing all sorts of tricks however ours was very boring and didn't really bring anything extra to the meal. I was totally hoping for some throwing and a little spice to the meal since I heard so many great things. However we got an onion volcano and some very dry jokes.

I also find this place ridiculous for pricing. I know seafood is expensive but you can't honestly tell me I'm getting 7 pieces of cut up chicken for over $20 and a few prawns. I left feeling very hungry and I ended up stealing vegetables from other people who didn't want them. I just don't see the appeal. The steak sauce was also not my cup my tea that's just personal taste and I won't let it reflect on the rest.

Honestly I found the guy who cleaned the grill after to be more entertaining. Everyone has always raved about this place and I can see the appeal but for me it just didn't cut it. I would have rather spent it on a steak dinner and left feeling full.

The decor was nice. However portions to price really bothered me. I felt cheated and they kept screwing up the drink orders. They also did not fix our bill due the errors not being one to cause a fuss (usually) we paid and left but I really could have used someone to go that extra mile to change my experience even a little bit.

I may go back not sure how I feel about spending so much for a few pieces of chicken and few prawns. Could have been the chef we got I'm not really sure. The food did taste very good I just wanted more!"}
{"text":"Very good food, good environment, and fun to watch.  A little noisy, but would be ok for groups.  Surprisingly kid friendly, though we went on a Sunday night, it may not be other nights of the week.  Will be bringing friends with us next time."}
{"text":"Came for a work Christmas party. Had 18 people, however the reservation was for 20. They charged us $25 for the 2 that couldn't make it and called it a cancellation fee. As soon as we finished eating they basically kicked us out. Told us another group is waiting for the table, we couldn't even finish our drinks. Horrible service, would never return."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.  Did I mention yum?!  

Japanese Village is a great place for a great dinner.  Actually, it's dinner and a show!  I love watching the chefs as they cook my food - it's an awesome experience.

If you haven't been there, you get to sit around the huge grill where the chef works his magic.  It is a lot of fun and I would recommend it for a group of friends who want to go out and have a great time together!  I don't think it's a great date place because there isn't much privacy (with the whole sitting around the grill thing) but to each their own!"}
{"text":"meh...

ok - so the food was pretty good.  I'll give them that.  

The waitress was awful - forgot someone's appy, didn't listen to us, literally took a bowl of rice away from me as I went to chomp on it?  wtf?  screwed up almost everyones drink order.  Even the guy who ordered a pepsi.  lol  it was kind of comical - maybe that's part of their thing.

The schtick gets old fast.  I don't really care for places that have a 'schtick'... why...I'll just never go back because I don't like that kind of hype and rigamaroll.   

Maybe I will go back one day to take someone there on their anniversary just to have them wear silly hats and outfits and get a laugh...

hmph...sound like a stick in the mud don't I?

Anyway - will I go back?  Highly doubtful...been there...done that..."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun! The food is tasty but the 'show' is really what you are there for. It is a great place for a celebration. My six year old LOVED it! The service was wonderful."}
{"text":"My friend and I LOVE this place.  The price for lunch is really good, dinner gets a little pricey but you do get more food at dinner.

You get to watch your food being cooked which is fun.  It is quite noisy in the place because your sitting in big groups of people around all the grills, but its still fun to go with a bunch of friends.

The food is great! Their steak sauce must contain something to make you addicted to it...i could put it on anything! YUM!  You can even buy a small bottle to take home, but it must be used within 48 hours because they dont put preservatives in it.

The cooks are really nice and sometimes they do some funny things to get you into being part of the experience.  If you go for somebodies birthday they sing for you and get you to put on a pretend japanese hair piece (plastic) and take your picture :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the Oyser Panzu as takeout. It was brought fast and service was great. I give 4 stars because I only got 4 oysters which weren't very big, for $8.40.
I'll have to go another time for a better review."}
{"text":"We have been coming here years.  I think the \"new\" location is already looking shabby and ready for an update.

Food was great, but the child menu is for 7 and under...means my 11 year old had to order a $22.00 meal.  He liked the meat but he left a lot of the veg behind."}
{"text":"Japanese village has been the restaurant I've been going to for the longest out of my restaurant eating career. I love the food, I mean LOVE it. I'm the type of person I hate waiting for food, so the idea of being served something new (rice, soup, salad) one at a time while watching your meal being cooked appeases the fat person in me. I'm in love with their steak sauce aswell, to the point I'm dipping my chop sticks in and essentially eating the sauce by itself until I have a juicy filet minion to dip in it. 

Alright now to the downsides, there's a few and the only reason I didn't go with a 3 star is the food has strong appeal to me. No restaurant would ever get away with the shit Japanese village has pulled with me if they didn't have such delicious food damnit!  

The servers like to ignore special orders outside of the norm of their routines. I'm a saucy girl, I love sauce. I sauce the crap out of everything I eat, prob too much. I'm sure you gathered that by my eating steak sauce without steak. Any who I always ask for extra dressing on the salad, and without fail every single damn time I get one tiny splooge. Nothing works to get their attention, from subtle desperate gestures to full on flagging them down hand fully in the air like a kid wanting the teacher to just pick you for once. Yeah I love my sauce. I end up waiting till they are en route with rice before I can make my second request for more sauce. 

Next downside, their routines are played out, every chef since the time I first went there when I was 19 (I'm 27 now) still do this same shit.  Yeah haha magic mushrooms in your basement. -_- get some new routines! 

On to number 3, the fuck is with them charging for a damn song and picture now, that shit used to be free ! They don't even tell you they're charging for that now, just a nice little surprise nugget on your bill. 

On to my last negative, when their staff do something wrong they don't compensate for it. I had some dumb chef mix all the steaks together, I was devastated when he just piled all our steaks into one giant chopped up lump instead of keeping them speerated. Like the dude next to me got more pieces of steak, he's eating MY damn steak. Try and explain to them when you're dissatisfied, I dare you, all of a sudden no one speaks English. Just pay and begrudge them with no tip. 

Any who,  I still go back. Can't be that bad, right ? ;)"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the money! Our (Filipino) chef, was hilarious. Very entertaining and provided great service. While he was cooking, he was making jokes -- appropriate for kids and adults. For birthday celebrations, It was a bonus that the kids got to wear a rubber wig and Japanese outfit. The staff will come around with small drums and sing for the celebrant. They don't tell you there's an extra $3.50 charge, but it's worth it for interesting experience.

We went to the one in downtown Edmonton, but the chef was not entertaining at all. Plus he don't make the volcano on fire (may be a By-Law?). Anyway, if you're in Calgary, definitely book ahead. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Japanese Village twice, once and it amazing, and a second time and it wasn't nearly as good.

Overall, it is quite overpriced but they get away with it because of the entertainment factor. On my first visit, the chef was so funny and entertaining, leading to the second visit, which was underwhelming and boring. Not boring because I had seen it before, underwhelming because the chef didn't have nearly as much charisma as the first. 

The food was good but not spectacular, the drinks small (order beer!), the customer service was low. 

So far this place has been hit or miss."}
{"text":"I've been going to Japanese Village for years and years and I still love it.  Yes, they have a schtick and it doesn't change.  If you don't like this kind of thing go somewhere else.  Where some people find the front end staff rude I find them efficient.  Yes, you have to be on time for your reservation and yes they want to take your order right away, that's how this restaurant works.  Just keep in mind, if you're late and they wait for you the whole table is waiting.  I can be on time why can't you, it's not that hard.  The food is very good, I've never had a bad meal.  I've also never had trouble with a drink order, I love the Cherry Blossom.  It's also been said before that this isn't a sit around and talk after your meal restaurant.  They have another seating right after you're done, if you want to sit for an hour after your meal with a coffee there are plenty other restaurants in Calgary to choose from.

Really, just come in (on time) sit down and enjoy the fun, goofiness of it all, eat steak and shrimp, drink something good, fill your stomach and then off you go.  It's as easy as that."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is delicious, I have been there many times and eaten everything on the menu at least once and damn its good.  Make sure to make a reservation!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! We were bullied into coming early for a reservation then she tried to bully us with a $25 charge for people who hadn't arrived yet. On top of that she blamed us for not listening to her warnings about being late. She let us, a potential $600 - $800 tab walk out the door and told us it's okay, they're busy anyways."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat. No surprises, not too different from how it is done in Japan. 
Great place to take a group and watch the chef cook up your meal. 

Because this is beef-town, I usually order beef.  

Thumbs up for JVSH"}
{"text":"The first time I actually went was on New Years Eve.
Reading the Reviews on the Website, and hearing feedback from Friends, I was actually quite worried about going here, We made reservations for about 10 people, so a bigger group of people, and I heard last minute that a few of the people we invited dropped out.. That was my first concern simply because on here, I've heard of people having problems with people backing out, and them charging you per person or simply just cancelling your reservation all together.

Our plans were to meet up around 845, and when I got there nobody in our party had arrived, we were sat in the Lounge area for a bit until our party arrived.

Luckily we had no issues with the fact that we had missing members in our party, or that people hadn't shown up, but again being New Years Eve, I don't think they were really paying all that much attention.

As far as the atmosphere went, It was fun, Very busy and the people were very polite. They got to work pretty much right away with taking our Drink and Food orders, and within a matter of minutes we had someone making our food.

Everything seemed very fresh, and our Cook was quite funny and enjoyable, Most people in our party ordered the Steak and Shrimp, Everything was cooked to perfection and was hot and fresh.

The steak sauce I wasn't completely blown away by, It was tasty, but I found it to be quite creamy and didn't have much bite, It went well with the Rice and Steak, but that was about it. 
The steaks were cooked excellent, and the Shrimp were nice and juicy as well!

The drinks were nothing to write home about - I had two and they were both very sweet, Mine seemed to just be Sprite, Sugar Syrup and a little Booze, Nothing you could even get a buzz off of unless you pay $100 for a bucket load of them.

Overall, The food was awesome.. The atmosphere was fun, and our Chef was awesome..

Our table was very crowded however, and uncomfortable for alot of people.

I would go back again, and probably order the same thing - $45 for what we received, and the fun we had was awesome. But perhaps I would go on a slower night, or with less people."}
{"text":"The food was good it had a lot of variety for everyone at out party. Some people didn't like sushi but it had cooked noodles that were so delicious and generous portion size . The waitress was sweet and knowledgable about the menu. She gave some great a suggestions . I will defitnetlly return there"}
{"text":"This place has amazing, hot, fresh and fairly fast prepared food. I've gone here for dinner a handful of times and everytime I have went it's been jam packed with people, which can be a little bit of a downer because it can get very loud in the restaurant. Staff are friendly and very efficient. The only thing I would say is that they could really use some renovations and a bigger restaurant area so that you don't feel so squeezed together. If you want to go for dinner here, ensure you make reservations ahead of time. Yummy food and great staff here otherwise."}
{"text":"Good food ... crack/steak sauce, anyone? (My friends and I practically shoot it.)
Service level has always been uneven, and the reservation process is a pain.
Lunch is much better deal, unless you are dying to see the act put on by the chefs at dinner.
Wear clothes you intend to wash immediately due to the smoke from the open grills."}
{"text":"Our friends invited us to visit this restaurant. Food was excellent. We only had one hour to eat after that we were told that other people are waiting for our table and we have to leave. I was never asked to leave before I finished eating and will never come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came for a graduation celebration, Very friendly service. Staff was amazing!! Food was great as well. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Went here on Monday evening.  Wanted to try sushi, but went to this teppanyaki place instead because of its Yelp review.  There are only about 10 reserved parking spots for this restaurant.  Otherwise, you have to find street parking or garage.  The place is located on the 2nd level.  

Our hostess and server were very nice and helpful even though we didnt have any reservation.  We sat with other four people in the table.  The chef was average, there are many better chefs in Los Angeles area in terms of the show as well as jokes.  I thought the menu selection is minimum compared to other teppanyaki place I have been (believe me, I went to many different ones in US from Benihana, Tokyo Wako, Cho cho san, Kobe, and many others).  The food arrangement is also a little bit different since they didn't offer any rice (steam or fried rice).  Like other teppanyaki place, we were served salad and vegetables.  The teppanyaki package also comes with shorbet at the end (this is new to me).  The food quality is pretty good, comparable with other teppan places I have been.

It was surprising there were so many people having Birthday in that evening.  Every table always had Birthday song and show, including ours :(  At least 6 times I heard Happy Bday song with Japanese show while eating.  It seems like this place is #1 restaurant to go for Bday celebration in Calgary, which is a good spot for a family or a group of people.  The cost of the food is comparable with other teppan restaurants I went."}
{"text":"Cici, i doubt it was over 30 minutes for them to figure out your bill...perhaps you are mistaken?  They are very busy and as a business cannot hold tables, of course they need you and your party to be on time, otherwise they are losing money!  Aziz, the whole point is a group dinner, if you hate eating with strangers for sure go elsewhere!  They do not hide the fact that it is a group meal, get over it bud;)
I have been going here for 35 years and love it, i have met some cool people in the group dining atmosphere and love the fact that we actually speak while out for dinner!"}
{"text":"The food is usually amazing the service however is beyond terrible!!! From the time you call to make reservations to your end of meal completely rudest service I ever had!! The chefs give a great performance and I usually tip them way above the servers!!! I would suggest trying the locations in Edmonton! !! Amzing and always friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE IT! Honestly my absolute fave guilty pleasure. If you are looking for a cheap delish fast lunch too their lunch during the week is around $10 and just as good only a little smaller than their dinner portion.

There is nothing left on the plate when Im there. If it wasnt so rude id lick my plate. For Real."}
{"text":"This was my lunch go to place with my gal pal before she transferred to Edmonton. I'd never been before and she'd frequented it a lot with her coworkers, so one day I joined them.

We got seated at the teppanyaki table and watched as our meals were prepared. I got the salmon and shrimp and it was amusing to chat and watch the show. I've been told the ginger steak sauce is the best part of the meal, and they must know it here because they ask you if you want the sauce drizzled on your rice AND if you'd like a side dish of it. Obviously I said yes to both!

For just over $10, you're quite full, slightly thirsty (the food's salty!) and you smell like food. If the last two don't really bother you, head over to JV and try it out!

I've been told if you make resos, they won't seat you till everyone's arrived - so keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"Service is so bad...I just don't get it?? You would think the owners would just spend the time to teach or coach their staff. I mean it's the only outfit in town?! Honestly save your money and take your family out to Edo. AND they charge for hot sauce...lol...jokes!"}
{"text":"It is unbelievable how bad the service is here, its actually special.  You barley have your coat off and they're asking what you want for dinner, then your dinner comes and within seconds they're asking what you want for desert, and if you take more than 20 seconds to think about it or swallow your meat, they rudely ask again.  They unnecessarily and rudely rush you in and out, and god forbid you're 30 seconds late for your reservation, you will be yelled at and told you're paying for the late party.   The ONLY reason this place is still open is because the steak sauce is as addicting as a narcotic."}
{"text":"Excellent, and warm atmosphere.  A very fun place to bring family or a group.  Huge flames and the food has big flavour!  The miso and steak dressings were excellent as was all the vegetables and teriyaki meat.  Overall a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun time. Steak sauce is really good!"}
{"text":"they do a lot of work to make you happy and to make it entertaining.  The food is good, but not great


teriyaki chicken & shirp combination 3/5"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of JV for years now. Im going to say at least 25 or so years. They use to have two locations in Calgary one at Southport, the other on Third ave Downtown. Now both locals are closed and have since been replaced with their new location on 10th.
I have to say I am the only V.I.P. cardholder for Japanese Village this  gives you a 10 % discount on your total bill. I found this out when I was dining there about a month ago and presented my card.
The manager (John Arasaki), came over and spoke to me and told me did you Know that you are the only person with one of the cards left in Calgary. He said their was one other person, but he passed away.
Now getting on to the food. I usually like to go with a larger group of people, at least 10. That way I'm not eating dinner with a bunch of strangers. (sometimes I don't care). 
I just feel awkward eating in front of total strangers. It's funny though, I can eat at a teppan style restaurant in another city and not feel self concious in any way and not care who I sit with.
When you come to the newest location on 10th, you have to climb a flight of stairs. I'm not sure if the have an elevator, so if you have a guest that needs wheel chair access call ahead. I seem to recall an elderly person having an issue with the stairs when I was leaving.
Okay now for the food, I like the different combinations you can order. Steak & Chicken, Chicken & Shrimp, Shrimp, Shogun Special (Filet & Lobster), etc, all meals come with tea, rice, zucchini, onion, beansprouts, a salad a soup, and a dessert. 
I like the fact the food is prepared in front of you, and I have only had one really mediocre experience when I had a \"chef in training\". He overcooked most everything on the cooking surface. He was just slow on getting everyones orders off, and a little nervous. As for how it tasted, I don't think you can make that food taste bad with that steak sauce on it. You can put that stuff on anything, your rice chicken, steak, whatever, I can drink that sauce by the ladel. 
As for the show, I could really do without the show. I honestly feel embarassed for the chef if he can't perform the oversized salt & pepper shakers routine, and throw it behind his back and catch it.
I also can do without the cheezy one liners ie: soya sauce being japanese coca cola, or the cooking oil being motor oil 10w-30.
If the chef can just do a decent efficient job cooking, I'm happy !"}
{"text":"I agree with some other previous reviews that it's an 'ok' place for experiencing Teppanyaki style food.  I've been to other similar restaurants in USA. The show here doesn't have a variety of knife or fire games.  
I liked the soup and green-tea ice-cream. The steak could have been better and I (also the other group in our table ) didn't like the veggies. The cook didn't put any salt to it ! 
IMO, you can go there once to experience the style if you've never been to such a restaurant. Otherwise, you can pass."}
{"text":"My family and I have been there 4 times now in the past couple of years!  We loved everything about this place!  The food is excellent, the drinks are amazing and the entertainment is awesome!!!  We will come again to this place again!"}
{"text":"We went to Japanese Village for my girl friends birthday. She had an absolute blast. The food was good, but the atmosphere and presentation was amazing. I recommend a large group!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. When it was at it's old location on 4th & 2nd I would go often for lunch. The food is just delicious. 

The dinner experience is quite unique, and I've never been to anything else like it so my experience/review is strictly based in Calgary. 

They put on a really great show, the tricks are cute and the Chef's are funny and polite! You get quite the bang for your buck, soup, salad, your meal, and then ice cream or sorbet for dessert. The prices are reasonable considering the amount you get and how, really, delicious it is! 

I would have given this place 5 starts, however the front desk service can be pretty rude, especially if someone is running a few minutes late or one of your party members had to cancel last minute. The last time I was there, one of our party of 7 was about 5 minutes late and the front desk lady was not happy about it! I've never experienced the full wrath, but I have heard some pretty terrible stories about their front desk staff. So, unfortunately, while I love this place and would recommend anyone and everyone to go there, I can't give it a full 5 star rating! 

Enjoy your experience people just... make sure to be on time!"}
{"text":"A very frustrating experiance. 

We made a reservation for 12 people at 6:00 for my niece's birthday. There were 6 adults and 6 kids. They told us that they would only seat a full table and that we needed to wait for another reservation of 6 to show before they would seat us.  At 6:30 we asked if we could be seated at the table and have a drink while we were waiting for the 6 strangers to show up. They refused. The restaurant was less than half full so our request should have been easy to comply to and they were making us wait for other people who were late for their reservation.  The 'manager' was one of the most condescending people I have ever met, I can see why this place has been going steadily downhill. 

The ceilings are dirty and tattered, and the whole place looks grimy and made me question if this place has recently passed a food inspection. It is a sad shadow of the place it used to be.  Much better Japanese food in the area, give this place a miss. 

We decided to leave as we were hungry and they still were refusing to seat us by 6:45, we went to the place downstairs, Briggs I think, and after confirming they were not associated with JV, we ate there and it was wonderful. 

We asked for the managers name and he refused to give it to us, he also refused to give us the owners name."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend used to go to Japaneese Village once a week when we started dating. He got sick of the food becuase its the same food/show everytime. Me on the other hand can not get enough. Their steak sauce is yum yum(they even sell it in a bottle to take home!) They do claim their mushrooms are \"magic mushrooms\" grown in the basement and they use motor oil instead of cooking oil.. but its all in good fun.Hard to get a reservation and if your 5 minutes late they will give it away.."}
{"text":"So here goes...I have loved JV since I was like 9 years old. I am now 43! The food, the sauce, the cooking in front of me and eating while still hot, the sauce, I even enjoy the guy who gets to come out and clean the table, oh and the food. 

But they have shifted in the quality of their service. Possibly because more people are coming or business now and days are more ruled by money not customer care. When I was going in my 20's they were still giving out as much rice as you wanted and no one really ever asked for more sauce on rice, it was just a request by some kids addicted to the sauce. 

Now I see some of the lack of service that have been mentioned  but they have always asked for us to be together in a group and be there at the same time, we have always had to sit with people we don't know and actually talk to them a bit, but not too much because not everyone likes to be talked to!  

So I think they have dropped on the service side, but a lot of the things that make JV special, unique, grimy and good are still there and I will continue to go back at least until my 9 year old is 43!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group and we were all completely disrespected. It felt like the automatic 18% gratuity they were getting made it so they couldn't care less about us. We were told that if we were late they would give our table away. So we all arrived between 6:25-632pm and our reservation was for 6:30pm. At 6:32pm we were told that they were just about to give our table away. We then all had to wait for 20 minutes on top of that because they weren't ready for us. 

The billing afterwards was a disaster. They only had calculators and the poor girl working the cashier had to use a pen and paper to deal with the billing. The whole process took 30min+ alone. 

The only saving grace for this place is that the chefs cooking for the food in front of us was very nice. The food was also pretty tasty. 

DEFINITELY not recommended for groups."}
{"text":"This isn't the type of place you go for great service, it is where you go for entertainment. The food was good, not outstanding. We went with a large group, one of which is on crutches, it was difficult to get up the stairs and sit at a squished table. The service felt very rushed, I was asked to order before I had opened my menu because I sat down after everyone because I had to drop off the person on crutches and then go find a place to park. I understand they are quite busy but a little time for a table with someone who has trouble getting around would have been appreciated. A group of 9 of us was in and out in an hour, perhaps a good indicator of how they rushed us. Paying the bill was very difficult, surprised they don't have a better system for a place that clearly has large groups and has to split bills often. We were celebrating a few birthdays and they offered to do some sort of thing were they out costumes on the birthday people but we declined because we were told there was a cost of $3.50 to do it, which isn't a lot but if that's part of the experience it should not cost extra, build it into the cost of food. Probably wouldn't rush back, but a nice thing to do once."}
{"text":"I have never had a good experience there.   The food is decent.   Although everytime a group of us goes the majority is unsatisfied.  Once half the people got sick.  Everytime we go people complain about the price and poor food.   But yet the lineup is long?"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for lunch or dinner. I have noticed that you get an actual show from the chef during supper and not during lunch though. 
The menu is a little limited, but every selection I have had is delicious. I especially enjoy either cuts of steak and a side of the shrimp. They provide a sauce for the food that is absolutely one of a kind. I have bought many similar types at grocery stores but I have never found one quite as good. 
I have to agree with the other reviewer, the vents actually work now and you do not come out of there smelling like a burnt onion.  
We walked in without a reservation but the place was very full.
In downtown Calgary, this is one of the best deals for lunch.  If you want more attentive service and a show, you should take in supper though.
Great place."}
{"text":"Horrible place it is so dirty and tattered. They jam you in and rush you out.Less and less food each time you go"}
{"text":"The lunch menu is slightly different than the dinner one. Better value during lunch time. I have been going here for a couple of years and love it. Sometimes you will get a very entertaining chef who will set onions on fire. You do have to be on time for your reservation, and they won't seat you until everyone if your party has arrived. 

I love the steak and ginger sauce!"}
{"text":"I love going here for lunch.  The steak sauce is the best.  To the point where I Googled for a recipe so I could make it at home.  

In comparison to their lunch, the dinner is a bit expensive but worth it for the entertainment.  

Another of my Calgary favorites!"}
{"text":"Another disappointing dining experience. It started crappy and went downhill from there. A birthday dinner celebration booked for 16 people turned into 17 people (our mistake) with a last minute addition of a forgotten child turned our first 10 minutes into playing musical chairs and squishing us all in to a very uncomfortable space. The noise was unbearable in there. It was like being in a busy nightclub. Everyone who ordered pop complained that it was flat. I returned mine to receive a newer flatter one. Trying to explain to the waitress that it had \"NO BUBBLES?\" was comical. Yes I had to shout over the noise. I then asked for an ice water which I never got. My son drank his pop and wanted another. No Free refills. We paid $18 in flat pop for 3 of us. The cold soup came followed by the crappy salad (my lettuce was all in one piece) with only chop sticks and nothing to cut it up with I had to use my hands to pull it apart. Our cook came next and proceeded to place the plates around and asked us all who had the shrimp allergy then realized he was at the wrong table and packed up and left. Another young guy came and set up, told the same tired jokes and did the same old tricks that they are obviously all taught at Japanese cooking school... Expected and not funny after 30 years. We then received a block of cold rice and then it was like the sun came out for a bit when we were given a ladle of warm steak sauce for our rice and started to get our shrimp and steak delivered hot to our plates. The meats were very tasty even though a lot of it landed on my lap because my seat was about 2 feet away from my plate. Oh well. The veg was just ok. Three of the staff came back with the rubber Japanese hair and robes for the birthday boy and his wife and sang a very slow durgy version of happy birthday and made them dance to \"you are my sunshine\", took a picture and charged them $3.50 for it. LOL. We all declined ice cream and went to the front to line up to pay. Strange indeed. Then horror. Went to find a very stinky & filthy bathroom with an overflowed toilet that I had to step over to go to the only working stall at the end. Thinking about how filthy it was in there, I looked closer at the rest of the place on the way out and was surprised how messy and run down the place is. I don't remember the old location ever being that way. I remember when Japanese Village was \"the dining experience\" sad how things change."}
{"text":"* GO HERE FOR LUNCH AND NOT FOR SUPPER *

The price of lunch is half the cost of the evening dishes and is the amount you should be paying to eat here. For $12/person you can get a combination teriyaki chicken and beef entrée with vegetables (and grab a side of mushrooms). With the meal you will also be served rice (you can get multiple bowls and add the steak sauce on top of it) and either a small soup or salad to start. The meal is cooked in front of you on an open grill but because lunch is much faster and less for entertainment, the cooks do not spend as much time yelling and unnecessarily flipping things. They will pack you in tight here to fit as many people as possible with communal seating. If this sounds worth it to you, the food is quite good.

The steak sauce alone makes this place awesome and great value at lunch!"}
{"text":"Best teppanyaki in town. Been going here and the one when it was in the south for 30 years. Love it."}
{"text":"A - List - Highly Recommended. Where else in town can you get a carnival atmosphere with chefs cooking while trying to be funny, erupting volcanoes of fire at your table as well as a magician wandering through from time to time? That is Japanese Village - a place to eat great food with people you do not know while sitting around an impressive stainless steel cooking hot plate! The food is excellent, portions of chicken, steak and shimp are good but not overly generous. The sauces are excellent. If not extremely hungry, consider splitting a dinner and asking for extra rice. Bar service - $5 for domestic beer. For birthdays, they will come around with a japanese outfit for you to wear while they take your picture. Fun times - great business."}
{"text":"Quick and cheap lunch while maintaining the teppanyaki style of dining.  Entertaining chefs and polite servers"}
{"text":"The uniqueness of Japanese Village provides a challenge to review it.

I remember my first visit I was in stitches at the jokes told by the chefs, but now find them incredibly stale.

I enjoy the portions though as you get an amazing amount of food for the price you pay. The fact that you get soup, rice, a great helping of veggies, a main, shrimp AND dessert is awesome.  The steak is always great and like many many people mention... the steak sauce is to DIE for. I don't know what it is, but this is the stuff that will keep you going back again and again. Try putting it on the rice that comes with your meal.

Previous reviews express concern with feeling rushed due to turnaround times, but I've never felt rushed while eating at Japanese Village. The staff and managment has always been very nice to me. It's very low lighting in JV, so watch out when you come outside if it's still light out.

I do have a concern in terms of tipping. It's not clear if your tipping your chef or if your tipping your server. The servers here don't do near as much work as a server at another restaurant. I'd rather give the chef my tip.

People who are familar with the Benihana chain will recognize the teppanyaki style, but it's a certainly bare bones basic version of a Benihana and it has no sushi. I don't know why but other Japanese Villages in Canada do have sushi. I don't eat sushi, but I noticed.

Overall, you'll have a not bad time and you'll leave with a full belly."}
{"text":"A couple of friends of ours went on a trip to Japan.  The decision was made to have a going away party/dinner at Japanese Village Steak House.  I had been to the location in Edmonton as a kid and remember enjoying it thoroughly.  I was looking forward to trying it here in Calgary.

If you ever plan a group event, do whatever you can to ensure that everyone shows up at the same time.  Japanese Village wouldn't seat us until our entire party had arrived, which was a pain.  Due to the way it's setup though, it makes sense for them to force us to wait.  But seriously, make sure your guests arrive on time.

The atmosphere is great, with lots of different Japanese memorabilia kicking around (at least it looks Japanese, but truthfully it could be from anywhere in Asia).  The chefs really make the restaurant though.  Aside from cooking the meal in front of you, which is fun to watch, they are also very personable and often funny.

The food was fantastic.  I have nothing bad to say about the food.  It was cooked exactly as we wanted it done, which is obviously easier when the chef is standing in front of you.  It's also not that expensive, which is nice, but it's still pricey enough that I wouldn't go often.  It was the perfect send-off to our travelling friends!"}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant. Service was good. Food was good. Nothing special about the decor it could do with being modernized. Chef was entertaining at the table. It was a bit tight where he was cooking."}
{"text":"This place was really cool. I have only attended one other benihana-style restaurant. But this one was way better.

Pros: It seemed very authentic...at least from what I have seen from authentic Benihana places in Japan on tv. The shrimp were delicious.

Cons: You HAVE to be on time. If you say you will show up 5minutes late. They will give away your reservation. Which is not very nice. Really expensive."}
{"text":"I don't know why I came here considering last year was overkill for me. My work is close by and they LOVE doing welcome lunches here. I hadn't been here before until I came here with my co-workers. They love it because, if requested, can make the servers dress you up into traditional Japanese costumes and make you dance as they sing a song in celebration of your event. It's pure entertainment for those that don't get chosen to dress up and dance.

Anyway, the service is terrible. They treat you like sheep. And they definitely don't encourage you to stay around and converse with your party because they have another reservation and want to kick you out right away. 

So why did I come back this time on my own? I was craving the salty sea same ginger steak sauce thing they put over your rice! It's probably very terrible for you but the taste is so unique to Japanese village that I was craving it. 

This time I went to the dining side (not the teppanyaki tables) for a quick lunch. Note: they deep fry their teppanyaki chicken teriyaki! I know it doesn't make sense considering teppanyaki means fry-on-griddle or something right? 

Anyway, to sum it up. Sauces are good (I think they are all house made) and the rest was bad. Terrible customer service or lack there of. So I guess if you have a craving it's good otherwise I'm sure you can get teppanyaki at a better place that will treat you like a person - not sheep."}
{"text":"Not even sure where to start with this one.  We had read several negative reviews about this place...but had a single positive experience several years ago...so with inlaws visiting from a small town and celebrating a birthday we decided to give it a try...much to our disappointment.

Two seniors...two grown ups and a 3 & 5 yr old had dinner at the Japanese Restaurant tonight and immediately upon noticing no kids menu asked about a kids menu.  We were told what was on the menu was half price for kids ($10) knowing the kids don't each much and are picky we requested they share a kids meal which the waitress said was fine.  They like steak so we ordered the cheapest steak on the menu - teriyaki steak and expected a $10 bill at the end of the meal.

I ordered the chicken & shrimp meal.  Firstly we noticed how quickly the chef appeared and rushed through cooking the meal....there was very little entertainment value for what we paid unlike the last time we went.  Secondly I took one bite of my chicken teriyaki and had to spit it out because the texture was off.....further inspection of it in my hand discovered it was raw!  OMG!  I told the chef and he scraped it off my plate back onto the grill......cooking it almost beyond tender even squishing it to ensure it was cooked...or perhaps over cooked.  This was observed by everyone in our party.  Once he was satisfied it was cooked he put it back on my plate...at this point I was slightly disgusted and found myself breaking apart every bite of chicken in my fingers to ensure it wasn't raw before I ate it.  The entire grilled meal was also slightly greasy.

Supper is finished in 50 minutes due to being rushed and the bill comes....(side note we were never asked after our first round of drinks if we wanted more beverages).  Upon reviewing the bill I notice right away we were charged full price for the kids meal (teriyaki steak - $19.95) and proceed to question the waitress about it.  She begins to argue and debate the issue with me.  I reminded her we ordered and requested a kids meal and she still continued to argue with me about the fact that they served us an adult sized portion never taking account of what I was telling her.  She left with the bill....5/10 minutes later some woman comes over and continues to argue with me that we were served an adult meal....and so for the 3rd or 4th time we (now my husband is involved in the conversation) explain again that we had requested and ordered a kids meal...I further went on to tell her that my chicken was served to me raw and if this is going to be an issue perhaps I should get in touch with a health inspector....I mean really why should we have to argue over and over about what we ordered and what we were charged...there was no customer service and no apology at all.  And this woman says to me...and I quote \"DON'T YOU THREATEN ME....DON'T YOU THREATEN ME...DON'T YOU THREATEN ME\"...all the while we keep reminding her we ordered a kids meal and that is what we are paying for so please take it off the bill.  When our waitress comes back with the bill...and bill finally changed to reflect the kids meal that we ordered.....I ask who the very rude woman was and was told the hostess...the manager was too busy to come and talk to us.

I am a foodie who eats out alot.  This was a horrible display of customer service and we were not about to back down from this debate.  No customer service....servers and staff who are trained to argue and debate concerns (as read in previous reviews)...and a manager who can't be bothered to deal with issues.  Not to mention a teppanyaki chef who does not know how to cook chicken.

If you like MdDonald's you will like this place...if you want a good meal with customer service  do not waste your money..this place is not worth it."}
{"text":"WOW I am totally amazed at the price of this lunch special. So I got a lunch combo and after tax and tip, it was like $13. So I chose Teriyaki Chicken and Teriyaki Beef for lunch. It came with salad and rice and tea. There are vegetables as well. I loved it. 

How this work is that the chef will come and cook for everyone at his table. What I liked the most is the sauce. The sauce was just amazingly delicious (I think it was the steak sauce). It goes well with rice. 

The place was not too hot. 

interestingly, if its your birthday, they will make you wear a uniform and sing to you. Cool.

Overall, good price and good portion for the lunch special"}
{"text":"I have been there once. The food was fine. The sauce everyone talks about is tasty.

They charged me $3.50 for their waiters to do a rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" That is three times more expensive than ITunes. And defeats the spirit of the song entirely. 

Never.Again."}
{"text":"Dear god this place is terrible. The service is absolutely horrendous. I came here for the first time with co-workers for a quick lunch and while the food was good the service was horrendous. Not only was our server absent during our entire meal (we had to flag her down to get anything, or ask her twice in some cases (ie water). There were six of us and we were charged for seven dishes even though we definitely only had 6. No one at our table noticed at first, which is odd because we are all accountants... However, we each paid individually (they wouldn't split the bill) and this is where the trouble began. There was a mass of people waiting to pay and after we paid for our 6 dishes the manager said.. and I quote: \"you only tipped the server $3\". First of all if we decide to only tip the server $3 then that's our choice. In actually we didn't tip $3 we tipped the total of the 7th meal plus $3 plus an extra few dollars I there down because I was so embarrassed. I think the worst part is the manager didn't apologize for embarrassing us in front of everyone else and calling us cheap. The food is good here, but not the staff. Avoid."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write bad reviews, but this place has the worst service. Our group actually got yelled at from one of the staff members because one person in our party was running 10 min late. She was really rude, we didn't even get to the food that day.  After being treated like that, I will never attempt to go back."}
{"text":"Went here for a staff xmas party last night, we arrived on time. One of our party was having trouble finding parking, they told us we needed to take our table. We told them aboit the other party finding parking and were told we would have to order for her..once we were seated we were again told we would have to order for her..this happened at least 6 times in a five min period! The waitress kept rushing us to order and then had the nerve to tell us that we 45 mins to order eat and leave!!  Needless to say wasnt the holy jolly xnas experience we had expected! Had it been up to me I would have left and went down the street to the keg!! Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Japanese village - Ah, SO!

Want to watch someone throw knives around and make big, fiery explosions while you eat your food? Of course you do.

But if you're still living at home, it's sort of an unreasonable demand to ask your mom to fling utensils around and burn down your kitchen. Plus she's probably really bad at it, even if you're Japanese.

So instead of troubling dear old ma, where do you go? Japanese Village.

Now, I want to rate this so much higher. After all, it's a pretty different experience from your everyday meal. 

As for the food - it's cooked right in front of your face, and it's delicious. I had the teriyaki chicken and shrimp. I wish I would have ordered the teriyaki steak - it seems like your portion winds up being bigger. But, you're given white rice, veggies, salad and sherbet with every meal, so it's tough to complain. I do wish you could \"Sumo size it\" though.

Everything tasted a bit salty. But other than that the quality of the food is excellent and the show is entertaining. It's not authentic Japanese food in the slightest, but it'll warm your belly all the same.

But there are a few tiny bees in my bonnet. (As an aside, why do we still use that saying? It's been ages since anyone but hutterites and amish ladies wore bonnets. Unless hipsters are bringing them back into fashion... are they? If so, that's hilarious and I can't wait to see the instagrams. Instabonnets. Whatever.)

So let me say this: I still recommend you go here. I'd still say this makes for an interesting date night, birthday party or company function. But in case the owners are reading this - or in case you just want to hear some 24 year old white bread kid complain a bit, here's how I think the experience could be improved:

1. Japanese Efficiency.
Yes, we see it in Toyota - but that doesn't mean we want to see it when we eat. Par the course here is that you MUST be on time with EXACTLY the number of people in your party as you reserved for. No ifs, ands or buts. If someone gets sick, prepare to have some very pissed off Japanese ladies wagging their fingers at you. And you don't get seated until everyone is there.

Now, I understand why they do this. But they can sometimes come across a bit rude and it makes booking your function here a bit of a risk; if someone drops out last moment, you're screwed. 

They also like to get you in and out of here as fast as possible, which again, I understand. It's a very popular place and it costs them a lot of money if you sit and linger.

So when you come here, expect to get pushed out of the proverbial Japanese womb like a Prius. Book your \"sit and chat\" time elsewhere.

2. Come on, creativity!

The chefs give more or less the same presentation over and over and over again, so you can't blame them for perhaps being a bit tired of it. Our chef was great and had a wonderful personality on him, but it all felt a bit scripted. I'd love to see them mix it up a bit; these are some excellent chefs, so they ought to divert from the standard show every so often.

But still do the fiery explosion thing please. That's always fun. Always.

So okay, two smallish beefs; but because you come here for the experience and not so much the food, it'd be nice if they could work on fine-tuning that experience a little more. 

At the end of the day this is still a great place to go, so long as you know what you're getting."}
{"text":"A couple gfs have their birthdays around the same time so they decided to celebrate at Japanese Village. They called in ahead of time as it was for a larger party (20 ppl) and they were easily able to get a reservation. Dinner was for 6:45pm so parking is free on the streets. There is also covered parking right across the street for a small fee. One thing to note is that they don't seat anyone until your whole party arrives - which is understandable. Our whole party fit perfectly around two grills where all the action happened.

We were handed menus and they took our drink orders while we browsed the small menu. There's a handful of typical Japanese starters (tempura, karrage,oysters, edamame), and then complete dinners which include steak options, seafood (salmon, shrimp) and chicken and combinations. Most of us got steak and shrimp. For those of you who aren't familiar with how Japanese Village works, you order and they put on a little show and cook it right in front of your eyes. All the complete dinners come with soup (similar to egg drop) and a side salad to start, then they bring out some sauces depending what you order, in our case we got steak sauce and shrimp sauce, and a side or rice. **Confession time, this is my first time visiting Japanese Village** everyone was telling me that I HAD to mix the steak sauce with the rice...so I did and it was super tasty. They then put on their show, playing with the utensils while the grill heats up, throwing them in the air, behind them and what not, they show us a Japanese volcano where they pile sliced onions on top of each and light it on fire - I get excited about little things so I was pretty amazed, lots of oohs and ahhhs were coming from my direction. They put the protein on the grill first because we all had different preferences and then cooked up some vegetables which were tasty. Apparently, they use to have a lot of mushrooms in the vegetables but there wasn't much..still good though! They handed our food straight from the grill so it was piping hot which is awesome, vegetables were well seasoned, steak was cooked to my liking and the shrimp and 'yumyum' sauce was a little salty but all super tasty. Overall, lots of food to chow on and it all ends with a scoop of either vanilla, green tea or orange sorbet to hit the sweet spot.

Our chefs made jokes, sang songs and was really great entertainment! We all seem to enjoy our experience and the food was good. Japanese Village is a great place for couples that want something different, kid/adult birthday parties or even getting a whole group of friends together for an entertaining dinner experience but it's not a place you would visit frequently because I would imagine it would get repetitive. I'd say prices are reasonable, only because you get a show and the food served right to your plate. You can tell they work fast because it's a busy place so turnaround time seems fast but not GTFO fast, we were able to enjoy the show and food."}
{"text":"Didn't have a good experience with customer service and they made us sit with bunch of people that doesn't know us, food was ok but not for the price we paid, overall if anyone plan to try this place make sure bring 15 people or more, so other people don't have to be forced to sit with the group and be ready to get ripped off"}
{"text":"I have found the food and quantities to be consistently satisfying.  The chef routines are always the same, but you can deal with it if you keep your visit to once or twice per year.  I do enjoy going with others who've never seen this style of dining, as it's fun to watch their expressions as they take in the experience.  

A few minor beefs I have in relation to going with a larger group on a weekend are that you feel more limited with time (they don't mess around with maintaining customer turnover) and you can't visit very well because it tends to be loud.  I'm also not a fan of their reservation system and do consider this outing to be slightly pricey.  I have also noted that you freeze your butt off in the ladies restroom in the winter months.  

I do end up at JV an average of once per year, so clearly it continues to be worth the trip."}
{"text":"Japanese Village is a great place for a larger get-together. Except you won't be having much of a conversation at your table because you're sat around the teppan in a row. Japanese Village is the only teppanyaki in Calgary that isn't from the food court. The chefs here are also performers and if they offer you some \"Japanese BBQ sauce\" for the rice, do accept and accept in plentiful. That sauce is bombtastic. 

Do come for birthdays, just not your own. Unless you enjoy the humilation of being taunted in front of all of your friends. 

Alternatively you can also sit in the non-teppanyaki section and just order some food from the same menu and be served quickly."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!! If you want to go on weekdays I recommend making reservations for the teppan table.. As it is always very busy... The food was great and at a good value... I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 16 including 4 children. After getting seated the staff tried to compact our group with each seat edge touching to fit more guests in. The manager explained that because we had children we would have to put them on our lap or swat them behind us to make room for other customers that were going to purchase more plates. He told us that because our children were sharing meals they had to be seated away from our group. Our reservation was made weeks in advance for two birthday parties, mine included. The staff was rude and 
Unaccommodating. The manager called us cheap round eyes because we weren't purchasing individual meals for each of our children. My only regret is not video taping this horrible interaction on my phone. We are friends with one of the head chefs and have followed him for many years. We were treated almost this poorly our last visit in March for another birthday. We've had enough. The staff, the managers are rude and dare I say it, racist. We will never return to any Japanese Village Restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Japanese Village is the kind of restaurant where you sit around a table where they cook your meal in front of you (like Benihana in the US, but way better tasting) - so free entertainment. We only went once to this location in Calgary, and it was just as good as the one in Victoria. No clue why we didn't go more often. The only downside is parking is so expensive for whatever reason in downtown Calgary (more than San Francisco... makes no sense to me).  It's expensive for dinner, but reasonable (cheap, almost) for lunch. The best EVER is the steak sauce on the rice. The beef melts in your mouth. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I went for dinner with my sister as we remembered this place from its old location down on 4th avenue.  The food was just average.  The problem was that they sort of rush you in to your group table and then wam bam the meal is served as fast as they can rotate the dishes - my ice cream was served before I had even finished my meal.  It seems a great place for families with young kids, especially if there is someone with a birthday in the party as the staff do a big act to celebrate someone's birthday.  But overall it was a bit of a disappointment.  Won't go again."}
{"text":"I often find, as I have joined Yelp, that I find it necessary to write a review simply to provide a counter-point for people who just don't 'get it'. And, if there is one restaurant around you have to 'get', it's Japanese Village.

I have eaten there (lunches and dinners) no less than 30 times over the years. I could not differentiate between one visit or another. I, like all returning customers, can tell you all the jokes the chefs say (...\"Chicken from KFC\"...). To say they don't change things is to miss the point, or again, to not 'get it'.

Food: never had one bad thing there ever. The steak maybe isn't the bestest cut in the west, but with their sauce, who cares? The shrimp sauce probably has the highest calorie ratio of anything on the planet, but who cares? Everything tastes great. 

Reservations/Seating: These guys take their reservations seriously. They are the only restaurant that runs on a schedule, and they expect you to abide by it. If your reservations are for 7, be there before 7. You are told this five freaking times when you book, so don't get your knickers in a twist when you are either rushed or refused when you show up ten minutes late. Following that, there is another sitting in an hour. This is NOT a sit around and drink coffee and discuss restaurant. When you are done dessert, you are expected to leave. There are hundreds of other restaurants where you can hang out afterwards, but this isn't one of them.

Notes: while they don't proscribe it, I would suggest leaving the under-8s at home. The restaurant isn't (physically) setup for it, you don't get your money's worth, and you don't enjoy yourself.

With the staff, it's obvious there can be some language barriers. And, importantly, this is one loud place. Speak clearly and loudly, and all will be fine. You mumble a drink or food order, that can lead to a problem.

Get there on time, put the steak sauce on everything, go 'oooohhhh' with the volcano, have a laugh, and you will have a great memory."}
{"text":"Went there with my son and he loved it. i liked it too.

The typical japanese restaurant where the cook in front of you, so it was entertaining. Even though i am not a fan of sitting at a table with a bunch of strangers but my son picked it so i went along.

Thankfully the guys sitting next to us were super nice and our cook was a really nice Japanese girl that made the evening. She was really friendly and sweet, worked her butt off and put off a show for everyone at the table.

The steak sauce is amazing just as everyone claimed it was in their reviews.
Alberta beef is great, chicken was well cooked, vegetables very fresh and shrimp was tasty.

I will not give it 5 stars because i have been to this type of restaurants before and everything taste kind of the same. But i got to say it was really tasty. And my son loved it so much!!.

It was just way too much food, so go hungry. You will be stuffed!.

The place was packed for a week night, of course it was right after Christmas, but i swear there were at least 10 Birthdays in there that night!. So i guess it is a popular place to have a celebration.
The funny thing is the staff comes to the birthday table and make the bday person wear a geisha hairpiece or a warrior mask, the sing happy birthday and just make the people feel comfortable and have a few laughs.

I'd go back."}
{"text":"Japanese Village has improved since they moved into this new upstairs location on 10 Avenue and 4 St SW.  It took over the old Cannery Row location.  

One thing I've noticed when you sit around the teppanyaki (cooking table), the vents work so much better now.  I used to walk away smelling like the cooked food in the old restaurant but now it's much better.  I appreciate eating there more. 

The best thing about Japanese Village is the STEAK SAUCE!!  Yes, this steak sauce is phenomenal.  Have you been there at lunchtime?  People around the table put their rice bowls in front of the chef to have him put the steak sauce right on top of their rice - thus, the term \"Rice Soup\"!!!  Yes, it's that good!  It goes good with anything.  

I usually have the Teriyaki Beef and Shrimp and it only costs $8.95 at lunchtime.  There are different combos you can get.  The more expensive steak cuts are also available like filet mignon and New York strip.  Not only do you get the beef and shrimp, you get a choice of soup (shabu-shabu soup) or green salad with ginger dressing, lots of stir-fry veggies, a bowl of rice and a cup of green tea to wash all the food down.    What a deal!  

I understand that parking in the evening is validated by the restaurant.  Ask the restaurant more about this."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good here. I Usually order the steak and shrimp combo. Food is plentiful and flavorful.  You start with soup, salad, they gradually fill your plate with rice, shrimp, grilled veggies and steak cooked to your preference throughout the evening, and end it off with some ice cream. Plus the cook entertains you, some say it's cheesy, but it's still a good time regardless!"}
{"text":"Service a bit slow as people noted, but not poor to the point it would prevent me from coming back.  Food was good, and for what you get in terms of food/entertainment I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Man I went on Binge Sashimi buffett in this restaurant. 
They served Sashimi Buffett for quite decent price.
Quality of the Sashimi was also quite fresh.
I actually quite surprised to see this great sashimi place in calgary.
Yeah but I also found my sushi place served around san antonio area.
I highly recommend this restaurant in terms of quality, quantity, and price"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in over 10 years, and its still exactly the same and I don't know whether its a good or bad thing but I feel just, meh about the whole experience.  

I agree with the following:

Atrocious front end staff, rude and seemed upset that we didn't tell her that half our party of 8 were kids (BTW my kids are savage beasts and I always order them the adult meals).  We were still charged the mandatory 18% gratuity even though we were two families sitting together and made the reservation together, still charged us the 18% when we paid in two bills. Tacky.

Some \"chefs\" were more talented in the juggling and slicing and dicing portion of the meal.  And the same lame jokes are those I heard ten years ago.

Dismal veg, just onions, zucchini, old mushrooms and bean sprouts. My kids didn't touch them.

Egg drop soup tasted and looked like toilet water, and the salad to start was bagged lettuce mix with their house ginger sauce.

Shrimp app to start that comes with the mains is 2 shrimp cut into 4 pieces served on the side of your plate.

Mains were moderately overpriced and the steak was pretty tough and I ordered it rare.

And having worked in a restaurant I know what pop costs... no re-fills on pop here!  I have never been to any restaurant that does not do free re-fills on pop!  And they give you such a small glass thats full of ice and the pop gets watered down.

And if you are disabled or in a wheelchair, don't bother coming here, I didn't see any access as you have to go up a flight of stairs to get into the restaurant and its very tight in there.

I give them a pass, but probably won't go back soon, maybe in 10 years."}
{"text":"Since Calgary really only has one hibachi grill it is quite good.  However, going to other hibachis elsewhere, I've realized that Japanese Village isn't too great.  The staff is hasty and the chefs aren't as skilled as other hibachi chefs I've seen.

The food though is still outstanding, and the Japanese Village sauce is free flowing and delicious."}
{"text":"Very intresting concept.  It's nice if you have a big group to share a table with.  I tried the sakura cocktail, which was yummy just a bit sour. I got the teriyaki chicken and shrimp. I was not sure about the yum yum sauce on the shrimp ( basically garlic butter) as it was just too much butter. I think because they are trying to make sure the chicken is cooked all the way, its a bit overcooked. For the cost portions are reasonable.  The chef was fun and entertaining."}
