{"text":"I tried this place after seeing reviews about PHX Burrito House. The foods are so good. Pork in green chile burrito is heavenly. Homemade guacamole. Yummy! I come here often."}
{"text":"I can't actually comment on the food. I would rate the service as lousy. I waited 20+ minutes for a burrito i had already paid for. I got tired of waiting so I left. There were only two people in front of me and they each ordered a burrito to go. They left in 5-8 minutes so I thought mine should be read pretty soon. I waited another 10-12 minutes. Food never materialized so I split. Maybe I'm  just used to Chipotle"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! HOMEMADE AND AUTHENTIC! Very afforable especially for the quality. I'm from California and I know great Mexican food this is GREAT! I WILL BE BACK!   You know it's authentic when host calls you Mija!  worth trying trust me!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I eat here about 2x a week. The tortillas are perfect, the meats are tender, the guacamole is on point! This is one of 2 restaurants I have in favorites list on my phone. Great option for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"They make a good burrito but miss the details. Ordered to go...missing jalapeños & cheese! Had to doctor it up. ..for the price it should be perfect."}
{"text":"The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious. I had the Carne asda burro with  guacamole and it was absolute deliciousness. My fiancé had the fish tacos and he enjoyed them as well. We'll definitely be back another time. I'd love to try the shrimp burro."}
{"text":"Best carne asada and carnita tacos I've had in Phoenix. Their grilled chicken tacos are very tasty as well. The chips and salsa are amazing as the chips are the perfectly sturdy for scooping up globs of salsa, yet not hard as glass to keep from scraping the interior of your mouth. I can't believe I haven't heard about this place beforehand. Definitely a must if you're in the area. Also, the steak burrito and veggie burrito were a hit amongst my group. The tortilla is freshly made and the size of the burrito should be enough to please even the hungriest of guest."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 4 hungry dudes,  and they were all more than satisfied. Steak quesadilla,  pork carnitas and pork with green chili all got five star ratings from the table. Chips and salsa were great as well,  and affordable. 9bucks for a quesadilla and a drink. Great little spot,  clean and compfy,  with friendly guys working. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I visited in Phoenix (on a recommendation of friends), and I was not disappointed! I had one of the best burritos I have ever had, and have been back multiple times! The pork and green chili burrito is amazing, the horchata is delicious, and the margaritas are on-point (especially during happy hour)! The food is delicious and affordable, and homemade! You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh , all of it , but not the best in Phoenix  Tried a crane asada and green chili pork  I thought green was better       If you are comparing it to Taco Bell then it's the best  We didn't leave unhappy the service was great"}
{"text":"I have only been here once and had high expectations because of the reviews. I had a green chili pork burrito and it was everything I hoped it would be! The tortilla was AWESOME! Anytime I am around this place I will make plans to come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The shrimp burrito is killer. Chips and salsa are also great. Just writing this review makes me want to go get a burrito ...... guess I'll go get dressed and head over there."}
{"text":"The place is ok and would probably be good enough for a 3 but this is being done to temper all the 5 star reviews.  If you live within a mile and don't have a car, then this place would be good enough for you to walk to.  We had their 1) infamous shrimp burrito, 2) carnita tacos, 3) asada tacos, and 4) a chicken burrito.   None had the WOW factor that people were talking about.  Actually, the meats were bordering on tasteless.    I am not Mexican nor am a native Phoenician, but I do love to eat, and have eaten more than my fair share of burritos from a variety of places, from holes in the wall to glorified holes in the wall, so I know what a tasty burrito is.     The place is cute and clean and salsas were tasty.     If you have never eaten a burrito or taco because you were too scared to drive through a Filiberto's, then this place will provide a safe and boring introduction.  But I would recommend going to Chipotle instead.    Very disappointed with all the hype."}
{"text":"Not surprised bye how many reviews this place has .. This place is bomb ... I get the chicken burrito with rice and beans ... Love this place"}
{"text":"So good.  Talk about skrimps!!!   The shrimp burrito was delish! This place has a Mexican bingo (Loteria)  feel that will keep you wanting more.  Mmmm Also had some chicken blk bean burrito ... Perfect Saturday delight."}
{"text":"Top Notch Mexican food right here! Thanks Yelpers! I went here because of the great reviews.  I don't even remember the last time I actually ate a burrito. I typically stay away from them because they're a sloppy mess that are difficult to eat, and not very enjoyable.  I decided to give one a try here. If there was a place to eat one, I guessed it would be a place named: PHX Burrito House.  I went for a Carnita Burrito with refried beans, and while I waited for it, I enjoyed the BEST tortilla chips I have had in Phoenix, and some of the best I have had in my life. Super fresh and crispy, not greasy, not over-salted. The Salsa was fantastic as well. Little chunky, little spicy, great flavor. I was also treated to a small bowl of the Famous Pork with Green Chiles. Super tender pork with a delicious green salsa.(They also have a burrito with this) The burrito came out and it didn't disappoint! They don't try winning you over with an enormous burrito, they put all of their love into a medium sized perfectly rolled bundle of goodness with a nice firm tortilla. The Carnitas were great, rice was delicious, creamy refried beans. And how does one judge a burrito? Well, I cut it in half and each half held together until it was gone! Most places fall apart after a few bites!  Its a cruise for me, but a place I will definitely visit when in the area.  STOP going to those Chain-o-Berto type places and eat REAL Local Mexican Food instead!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week! Carne Asada tacos my go to every time! Today I had the chicken tacos again another great meal! The red amd green salas are the BEST! I dont jnow what they use to marinade their meat and chicken but its got great flavor! David and Daniel are always very attentive and take the time to get to know customers!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada burrito = awesomeness. The salsa tastes great and like homemade. You don't need to read any other reviews, just go! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Wow!!! The fish tacos were outrageously delicious! So much flavor, and the perfect amount of spice. The shrimp burrito was also delicious, and the horchata tasted homemade. We got a warm welcome when we arrived and found they had a great selection of beer. I wish we were locals because we would definitely become regulars!"}
{"text":"They have a sign outside that says \"Indian fry bread\" but don't be confused you have the right place. A friend and I came in this afternoon and the owner took our order --super friendly and welcoming -- over all great customer service. The food was great (I ordered a crane asada quesadilla, guac included!!). The place is very clean. It's a great alternative to the gajsbg(bertos) across the street, I would definitely come in any time!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to swing by for a quick bite or take out. I love the shrimp burrito at Phx burrito house and y husband swears by the carne asada burro. The chips and salsa is great and they serve beer too!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Great flavor, good prices and the cuisine is ' simply' good.  Can't wait to try the grilled fish tacos next time."}
{"text":"This is one of the best, if not the best burritos I have ever had! And it's really not that expensive ... $7.00 for a very large pork carnitas burrito. Guacamole was $1.00 extra. The tortilla was so good too! The staff are super nice too and you can tell they really care about giving you food and good service. Their hours are a little limited, but working on expanding them. I really recommend giving this place shot ... they're an independent local business that's worth supporting"}
{"text":"Great food - i usually go for their carne asada burrito. Its usually on point (love their tortillas) but wish they would mix ingredients a bit more as I end up with bites of only guac or only meat. Staff is super friendly but any hint of it getting busy and the food will take forever to come out. Despite their few flaws it's a great spot."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here and I wasn't impressed. First, waiting to get our order took longer than expected. Then the food came and it wasn't what I was expecting. I ordered the Shrimp burrito and it was all tortilla/cabbage. Sad, I wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"The good part about this place it was spotless and very clean but I'm warning you the reviews on this place have to be false there are no you enormous burritos the hot sauce had absolutely no spice & I I'm not much of a drinker but at this lunch I decided to order a margarita with my friend I could not tell that there was any tequila in the margarita whatsoever save some money go across the street to Filibertos actually they're carne asada burritos are better."}
{"text":"Burrito love! Big generous delicious burritos! My favorite is the shrimp, it's packed with shrimp not a lot of empty fillers. Great chips and salsa, too."}
{"text":"My new favorite burrito joint in Phoenix. The tortillas are addictive. My 2 go-to burritos are the bacon breakfast burrito and the green chile pork burrito. This place is a great alternative to the overly greasy gut-bombs you get at the omnipresent ****berto's restaurants that dominate the landscape."}
{"text":"Small family owned spot with friendly service and truly fantastic burritos. Just put some pico de gallo in there for me and I won't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I'm all about their red chile burrito.  Green chile and carne asada were pretty damn good too but there's something about the red chile mixed with the gooey cheese, rice, beans, meat, sour cream that hits the spot.  It essentially feels like mexican (or whatever...mexican-american..) comfort food.  Prices are good (comparable to chipotle/qdoba's of the world) but the flavors are not the same at all (burrito house is better...).  They do a good job mixing the burritos here too. No one bite of only plain white rice, one bite just beans, etc. Only complaint is it needs to be even spicier!"}
{"text":"Love these burritos and the staff is absolutely amazing! You can make your own burrito and the restaurant isn't in the best place for it to be found but when you know where you're going, you'll never forget it! I've been to this place numerous times and it's really the same great service every time!"}
{"text":"I love their shrimp quesadilla that has onions and cilantro! Also their breakfast burritos are the best!"}
{"text":"My friend had the green Chile burito he said it was really good. I was going to have the same but the green chicken parole got me. It was excellent.  Also the chips are homemade and the salsa tasty."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food I've ever had in Phoenix. The service was excellent very nice guy owner was there welcomed us personally, helped us order. The food was 10 out of 10 burrito was perfect perfect combination of meat and beans and rice. After eating felt great."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's tiny but super tasty. I've had their red burrito. And won't have anything else cause it's so good."}
{"text":"Go to PHX Burrito House! It's excellent, the decor is rad. The food isn't as greasy as like most other taco shops and it's better than Chipotle. The price, taste, salsa, free chips, and portions are all where I like them to be. The only part we weren't huge on was the grilled chicken. Salsa was on point."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Friendly service. I went here for dinner however I feel the atmosphere/vibe of this place is more suited for lunch. When I go back I hope to come during a lunch hour."}
{"text":"The food was amazing@  But the service could use come work!  It was really slow getting our food to us! We waited like 30 minutes for an order of 3 items."}
{"text":"The green chili burrito is soooo good. It's a nice little joint to get your burrito fix."}
{"text":"Excellent Burritos. Tortillas very soft and fresh. Homemade chips and salsa, best we have tasted for ages and the place is spotlessly clean. Well worth a try!"}
{"text":"Best local Mexican I've ever had! Had a beef and red chili burrito and a 3 pack variety of tacos. AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to the Phoenix Burrito House based on an article in the AZ Republic. I ordered the green chili pork burrito. It was outstanding; great flavor, fresh, and just the right size."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for a fast quality meal for $10. I had the shrimp burrito which was very tasty and had a sufficient amount of shrimp. All ingredients were fresh and the salsa had just the right amount of spice. I will definitely be back to try the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here today for the first time and we loved it! We enjoyed a shrimp burrito and fish tacos both were delicious! The homemade salsa was some of the best we've ever had and the tortillas were thin and flavorful. The pricing was also great, we will absolutely visit again."}
{"text":"Wow. I typically love burritos stuffed with everything under the sun. A coworker brought one of these burritos in and gave me half. Carne Asada with NO filler. No cheese, beans, pico...JUST tortilla and meat. Amazing!!! I went in today and got one, exactly the same.  Seriously delish. I'd highly recommend these guys! High quality meat...not chewy, full of flavor. Tortilla is awesome. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried PHX burrito house for lunch the other day and was slightly disappointed. The chips and salsa were pretty good, and the staff was friendly. However, I ordered 3 tacos, but they came out with a burrito instead, which I was okay with. The burrito was good, but I wasn't amazed. Willing to give it another shot in the future."}
{"text":"Favorite burrito spot in this part of town. Fresh ingredients and consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"This burrito house had great fresh food with both seafood, vegetarian and meat options. The service was fast, very friendly and accommodating. It was a clean and small space, and even though the restaurant seems like it's in a slightly sketchy area I would strongly recommend it for some delicious and affordable Mexican food."}
{"text":"I love this place, they haven't disappointed me yet. The House Special breakfast burrito is the best I've ever had. They're also very friendly."}
{"text":"well technically its not a house, its a restaurant. if you can get past this issue, the burritos taste very good"}
{"text":"Great burritos!! Yummy chips and salsa too! We had left overs and left stuffed. Will come back forsure next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I felt a little lost in the chaos during lunch hour but the food was good & full of flavor"}
{"text":"Best burritos ever. The meat is fresh and well seasoned and the tortillas are fresh and soft. The service is nice and friendly and they make your food when you order. The Mexican wedding cookies they sell there are delicious."}
{"text":"First things I look for when visiting a place are the cleanliness and hospitality. They had both. I liked the owner a lot. He is down-to-earth and genuine. Before my family and I finished our delicious food, he invited me out to shoot hoops (basketball). I might get too fat frequenting this place before I can confidently take him up on the offer. The food is that good and will have you returning in no time. Thank you for great dining!"}
{"text":"Phoenix Burrito house has the best burrito I have had in Arizona. On top of the food, their customer service is great with engaging in conversation as well as making sure customers are satisfied!"}
{"text":"Great and filling food. Definitely worth the visit. Bring your appetite because the burritos are huge!!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious burritos! The tortillas were so fresh and the salsa was so tasty!!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful hidden treasure.  All natural food, really friendly staff and very clean.  I had one of the best burritos I have had in Phoenix.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible food, terrible margarita. The shrimp burrito had no taste, except for whatever that mushy thing I bit into that wasn't shrimp or cabbage. I left three quarters of a burrito and a mostly full margarita on the table when I walked out. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I was Greeted nicely. The decor and music was Latin and cute made me feel welcomed and at home. They have delicious Mexican wedding cookies in the front like my Tia makes. The horchata was very good! I got the grilled chicken burrito . It comes with rice I had black beans but you do have a choice of the beans you can choose. Sour cream and I added guacamole. The tortillas are hand made thats the best part. Sad to say when I bit into my burrito when I got home it was the most salty burrito ever! Everything else in it was delicious but the chicken was 2 salty that I could not finish it. The salsa was good and chips were okay. Although the owner did tell me if I did not like it he would buy it for me and give me my money back. But I did take it to go otherwise I feel like he would of had my food redone this is the only reason why I am giving this place 2 stars. I am not sure if I will return right now. If the chicken wasn't salty I would of rated this place to 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos! I stopped in here one morning on a whim and ordered the house special breakfast burrito and it was delicious! Very fresh ingredients (potatoes, scrambled eggs, grilled onions and grilled jalapeños-with optional meat for extra $) all cooked very well. I stopped in the next day with my husband and now he's hooked. We've  since tried carne asada, ham, chorizo and veggies in the burrito, all were great.  The restaurant itself is cleaner and seems roomier than when it was Fry Bread House.  Give yourself 10-15 minutes for the order to be prepared; if you are taking to go and  want it faster, call ahead."}
{"text":"Drove past this place a couple of times decided to finally try it out. I'm so glad I did. Cashier was extremely nice gave me and my friends chips and salsa while we waited for our food. They normally charge for them but they gave it to us for free. The food was amazing we all got a different type of burrito and all of us loved our burritos. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Really good green chile.  Lately they haven't been consistent much, but they are still the best burrito in town."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the PHX Burrito House, and I had the green chili pork burrito. One word: delicious! I will definitely be visiting the Burrito House regularly."}
{"text":"First time here but not my first experience with a breakfast burrito. First of all, the place has been cleaned up and and looks clean and nice. Second, the staff is super friendly in a neighborhood shop kind of way. Third, the tortilla was super fresh and the eggs and potato burrito was delicious. It tasted like my mom made it at home. I'll definitely be going back and recommending others too."}
{"text":"five stars all around.  ... food is delish (we had a breakfast burrito) ... burritos are big enough to share ... chips and salsa portion is plentiful   ... sides are meant for one maybe two people 2 adults ate breakfast burrito, chips and salsa, side of black beans, 2 drinks... $20  Service is family oriented and very friendly. We will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"This place is clean authentic and delicious!  I ordered their shredded beef burrito and it came out delicious! And their homemade sauce is to die for! This will be a new hotspot!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and have to say it was a great burrito and margarita. Will come back to try the breakfast burrito"}
{"text":"Lovely little place and friendly staff.  I fully intend to go back, as my review revolves around only the shrimp burrito, which was decent but lacked substance.  Dry, too much cabbage and not filling enough for a hungry guy.  I am looking forward to hammering down a breakfast burrito next and hope that it scores better than the previous mentioned."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually go once a week and order enough food for 2-3 people just because I can't decide on what I want. I like getting the green chile pork or  red chile beef burritos, though the shrimp burrito is also a great tasty, option as well, if you want to feel less guilty about your food choices."}
{"text":"I am currently finishing my chorizo and cheese breakfast burrito, and it is so good that I couldn't even wait to finish eating to share my thoughts.  The tortilla is flavorful (right?), the chorizo has nice spots of crunch and great taste, and the eggs and potatoes are perfectly cooked and seasoned.   *It also doesn't feel like an atomic bomb was dropped into my stomach, which says a lot for a burrito...*  Add some of their house made salsa (I could drink this stuff), and you have a high quality meal for less than $5.50.  GO LOCAL and try this place!!!!  Can't wait to come back and try something else :-D"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week! These burritos are amazing. The flour tortillas are made daily by a local tortilla maker and they're the best way to wrap up all the ingredients inside (though I would probably order a stack of tortillas to go if I could). I get the red chile beef burrito every time with refried beans, rice, cheese, sour cream and guac. The chunks of beef are tender and the sauce makes the burrito gooey and amazing. This is comfort food...Best burritos in Phoenix. A must try!"}
{"text":"Simple ingredients, but done soooo deliciously well! The friendly staff is a major plus as well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place really does have the BEST burritos in all of Phoenix.  Great food and a FANTASTIC staff, it's a win/win combination.  I crave their burritos all day, everyday. The red beef and the shrimp burritos are really stand out!"}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out while in town. The wait time for our order took longer than expected for 2 burritos and a Chorizo plate. I guess that only makes you even hungrier! Once the food arrived, I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't impressed either.  This place is alright. Will give them a try again when I return to Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of the best burrito spots in Phoenix! Tortillas are soooo good. Can't go wrong with any fillings. Carne Asada is delicious. All day breakfast burritos are one of the best parts of this gem. Family owned and operated and it shows that they care about their food and their customers. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It I could give zero stars I would. I used to like this place until my experience yesterday (07/22/16).  It was about 6 pm when I got to the Burrito house,  after I ordered a slew of people came after. I had my dogs outside and asked the counter person if he could bring it outside to me so I could wait with my dogs on the patio.  Fast forward over 15 minutes and everyone that came if after me already had their order. I asked if my order was ready and they stated a few more minutes. The people that came after I inquired left with their orders.  The counter person finally came out with my order and I asked why everyone that came in after me had their order and I was still waiting outside with my dogs. He stated we had a dinner rush and it got crazy. I replied I ordered before the rush and I still got my order after the crowd.   The counter person stated he would talk with his manager. Then returned and stated the manager said you can either have your money back or the food. They did not even attempt to make the situation right. I asked for the money back and left furious. I will never go there again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The shrimp burrito is so delicious and fresh, their horchata is my favorite in the city and the guy behind counter (owner?) is always so so friendly with a big smile. Definitely one of my favorite spots in phx"}
{"text":"We were craving a breakfast burrito and this was the right place!  Great food, great service, super friendly staff.  This was our first time here and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is always good here. The salsa is amazing amazing and the chips are crisp and extra thick. Pork burrito was phenomenal. Staff is always friendly and service is fast!"}
{"text":"Very small but friendly staff and good food. The portions were a tad on the small side but still filling. Just happened to come across this place online but glad I did."}
{"text":"Great place for burritos in Phoenix!  The owner really runs a great establishment, friendly service, excellent good.  Have been here for both breakfast burritos and dinner, and never had a complaint.  Was surprised how good the chile relleno burrito is...it was definitely worth the price.  If you're looking for filling, fresh Mexican food, worth the price, this is the place."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Burrito was good size. Green Chile was tender. The rice in burrito was nice touch. Really brought it full circle."}
{"text":"I've been driving by PHX Burrito House since it opened, and thought I'd finally stop in after a friend raved about it.  My friend was totally right.  I went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, so I got to talk with one of the owners a bit.  I learned that they own El Sol and El Zocalo in Chandler.  I'd been to both of those places before and really liked them.    I got a carne asada burrito.  The meat was prepared properly and had a good flavor to it.  The owner gave me a sample of some of the chips and salsa, which were very good.  My favorite part about the burrito though was the tortilla.  It had a perfect texture and thickness to it.  The owner told me they make them all right there at the restaurant.    They had a good selection of breakfast burrito offerings too.  So....I came back the next morning.  I had the bacon breakfast burrito and I can honestly say it's the best I've ever had.  The flavor was tremendous, and again, I just can't get over how good their tortillas are.  Great place.  Extremely friendly owners.  Fantastic torillas. Check it out."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best quesadillas we had chicken and shrimp friendly service reasonably priced will be back SOON"}
{"text":"Great  tacos! Great guacamole! Hard to find but worth the search! Very cool little local place that has a homey feel. Watch out for the hot sause because it's really more like super hot sauce."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and disgusting food to top it off. Decided to try for first time for lunch. As soon as I walked in the gentleman behind the counter questioned me about \"spreading the word\" about this place, felt almost like he was demanding me to. I kindly responded that it was my first time there that I'm not from the area but would be glad to spread the word. I placed my order and quietly sat by table closest to the register/counter, scoped the place out from there and observed how they worked. Four more customers come in after me, three of which seemed like they had not been there before, they asked about portion sizes, ingredients, etc... They order and find seats to wait, one of them sat at my table since I had an open chair. About fifteen to twenty  minutes later two of the customers that ordered after me got their orders of multiple items and walked out. I saw this and thought that mine should be next. Then the one who ordered last, who is now sitting across from me gets his order, right then I asked the gentleman, same one who asked/ordered me to spread the word,  \"what about my order?\" He shrugged and said he didn't know and walked back to the kitchen. Then he comes out holding some dine-in orders and proceeds to serve other customers. By now about 30 minutes have passed, my lunch hour was almost over, wasted rather. I walk up to the counter upset and ask for my refund, I tell them I don't want my burrito, just my refund so I can return to work on an empty stomach. The gentleman gives me a weak incoherent apology, opens the register, and explains that all those people he served before me had placed phone-in orders and I should do the same next time. That's what pissed me off!  I called him a liar, told him that he was insulting, especially when I was able to hear all of those people's orders from where I was sitting. He hands me my refund, I said \"thank you for ruining my lunch\" and turn and leave, angry and hungry, hangry. As I get in my car they walk up apologizing, and hand me my order. I said \"thank you but it's ok, I don't want it\". The gentleman was persistent, apologized some more and explained I didn't have to pay for it. I took the burrito so that they would leave so I could back out and head back to work, with no plans on eating this burrito. I was persuaded to at least try the burrito which I regretted immediately. It was so salty, no flavor, just salt. It ended up in the trash bin.   To management: If you make a mistake, own it, don't try to come up with a lame excuse, while at the same time insulting a customer! Also, cut back on the salt please! The tortillas, the meat, the salsa, they were all salty. Unless you made it salty especially for me, to rub some salt on the wound... Again, thank you for ruining my lunch."}
{"text":"Best burritos in this part of town! I loved the green chile pork and the breakfast burritos are to die for -. they're very friendly and give great service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burrito in AZ. I have been search for years and I finally found the place."}
{"text":"If you want a burrito then look no farther! Excellent carne asada and incredibly friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Always good to find a courteous staff and great food. I've eaten here twice and have tried three items. All of them were very good. The Pork Green chile is a great place to start when eating here. The burritos are a good heart size."}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way home from work yesterday on a whim for my first time because I was hungry, and boy did I have a pleasant surprise! The mature blond lady working behind the counter asked if it was my first time there to which I obviously responded \"yes\". She was extremely friendly and gave me the rundown on what they serve and recommended the green chili pork burrito of which she gave me a small sample. It was delicious! I ordered it and because it was my first time there she threw in a small side of chips and salsa. When I got home and opened the container I was impressed and happy to be greeted with a hot and large burrito that required two hands to pick up. The tortilla was soft but firm. The burrito was filled with the green chili pork and rice(but not too much rice), black beans(pintos and refried are available if thats your preference), cheese and sour cream. The chili had a bright green chili flavor and did have a kick to it but was not too spicy for the average American who likes Mexican food.Everything tasted fresh and their recipe is delicious. It is definitely one of the best burritos I have eaten. I am anxious to try their Carne Asada burrito next!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food!  Eaten here several times and it's always terrific."}
{"text":"Already addicted (2nd time here within a week). Tonight I got the Carne asada quesadilla.....it is soooo good. Meat is marinated perfectly. It comes with quac and sour cream. My kid got a bean burrito....didn't like it bc he's a cry baby and only likes refried.... The owner saw my kid not eating and came over.... He asked if he wanted something else.... Then offered to make refried beans..... He went above and beyond!!! My kid was happy after that and enjoyed his burrito. Yummy beans. I love the decor, really simple with \"Loteria\" artwork on the walls... Love it! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! With great/reasonable food, a dog friendly patio and amazingly friendly staff, it's a Mid-town must"}
{"text":"I got a chorizo breakfast burrito which was REALLY good. The meat tasted fresh and not dry like some chorizo. The salsa was so good and the chips were exactly what you want from homemade chips. The staff was super friendly, they knew the menu and the product very well, they could tell us where the meat came from. I love that the restaurant is family owned, and you can tell from the quality of the meal and the care of the restaurant. It was clean and nicely decorated. And we saw at least 3 regular customers come in and were greeted by the staff like friends."}
{"text":"Food came out really fast which was questionable and salsa that came with chips was COLD. Also ordered shrimp quesadilla and for $10 not worth it. Barely any shrimp in it..."}
{"text":"I work nearby this place, will stop by for lunch once in awhile. Few days back, I placed an online breakfast order for my coworkers and I. After picking up the order, all orders were correct, except mines, I had selected breakfast burrito with chorizo (paid an extra $1 for chorizo) I was pretty disappointed. Two orders of breakfast burrito with chorizo were ordered only one was missing the chorizo."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a burrito... probably some of the best in town , and it's nice to encourage local businesses too!!"}
{"text":"Amazing burritos! We have been at least 4 times and really enjoyed their food- the burritos are amazing and the quality of meats is excellent! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place! I had bean burro enchilada style, my spouse had the fish tacos. Both were excellent. The service was great and the price complimented the food. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I've gone twice and had the green chili burrito -- I have dreams about this burrito. My boyfriend has tried the carnitas (which is not shredded) and chicken. He said the chicken was great but wished the carnitas was shredded. This is a going to become a go-to place for us!   Con: I wish the restaurant actually had morning hours so I could get the breakfast burrito for breakfast!"}
{"text":"A co-worker and I were deciding where to go to lunch today. We saw good reviews about this place and decided to give it a try. It were SO good! Among the best I've ever had. I had a breakfast burrito and was really excited they served breakfast burritos all day! My coworker had the shredded beef, which was equally delicious. Service was great and restaurant was clean. Would return again."}
{"text":"love love love best (in my humble opinion) is the pork in green chile burrito with all the fixins great prices, friendly service amazing food go here."}
{"text":"Why waste your time here..Nortenos at 7th ave and Roosevelt...carne asada burrito.. $4.99 and no rice n beans and other stuff...here at burrito house, it costs you $7.75 and not nearly as good."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, friendly, good food. I love their breakfast burritos- the bacon is always nice and crispy and the eggs taste fresh. The tortillas are delicious, and I'm not usually a fan of bread-y foods. The employees genuinely pay attention and start recognizing people after just a couple visits! A+!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I only had the tacos, but they are great. Def. coming back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Simple order at the counter mexican affair. The tortillas are fresh and homemade! The chips ate also fresh and homemade... The salsa is fantastic... Next time i will order a chicken quesadilla. Really like this small family owned place!"}
{"text":"They were pretty quiet for dinner.  The positive to this is that I got excellent attention/service and my food came out super fast.  The counter girl was exceptionally nice, offering me tiny samples of a few of the meat choices.  The green chile pork was HOT, while the beef in red chile and shredded beef were mild.  Ordered the two beef enchilada special.  Their red sauce is really good, not overly tomato-y or oily, with a nice spice level (I could taste the garlic).  The salt level for a forkful of enchilada and rice was perfect.  The cheese was really great (I loved how salty it was).  It actually tasted better as I continued to eat it.  The rice was plain, fluffy, and well-cooked.  I'll be back to check out their chorizo breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"The best burrito in AZ by far! They are huge, pack lots of flavor and need to be eaten with a shovel! :) The chips and salsa are also fantastic. Very clean and the service was incredible! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The meat in the carne asada tacos and pork in the burrito was really good. My friends said it was the best street style tacos and burrito they'd ever had. The bean burro was just ok. Simple atmosphere with Loteria cards on the walls. The service was ok."}
{"text":"I am so glad to have this gem in my backyard. The service is sometes slow, and the salsa is not the greatest! But the food is fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"I had the pork in green Chile sauce burrito. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"I love the decor it has pictures of loteria witch brings me back with my Primos and beating all the time and them crying to their mother that I was cheating which I probably I like it was very affordable at the carne asada burrito pretty tasty the card it was pretty tender no fat I like the fact that they have black beans but their chips and salsa we're horrible salsa taste like pureed tomato No spice no flavor the chips were way too thick more chewy and crispy other than that the place would be five stars who definitely back"}
{"text":"Tucked away inside a charming little house off the hustle and bustle of 7th Avenue is this gem that cooks up some of the best shrimp burritos around. They're refreshingly light, a welcome change after all the sauce-smothered enchilada style and heavy carne asada burros I've been scarfing down on my PHX-Mex tour.   Oh, they make a mean carne asada too..."}
{"text":"Amazing burrito, chips and salsa. Service was super !!   My Margarita was on point.  Will definitely be be back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome chips and salsa, the carne asada was very good. I gave them 4 star's because I havent tried thier chicken. The burrito was a good size, tortilla was thin and not gummy."}
{"text":"I must admit I put off trying this place because burrito places are a dime a dozen. I was pleasantly surprised the food was good. I have to suggest that they don't be afraid to use salt. every good cook knows that's the way to bring out the flavor. However the machaca was delicious. it's finally nice to find another restaurant that makes machaca with jalapenos and not bell peppers. I gave only 3 stars because the food could use more salt in the cooking to bring the good flavors out and that situation in the parking lot with the bar next door kind of weird. and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The best shrimp burritos in town. Amazingly fresh house made tortillas. The owner is very, very nice. This place is a definite standout in a place known for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Burrito House offers a very casual dining experience with a fairly simple menu, which is great. I ordered a Carne Asada burrito with everything. It was good, but could have been better if 'every thing' included more than just rice, beans, carne, sour cream and a little salsa. It was a little bit plain for my tastes and the salsa wasn't hot enough, but the tortillas they use are great. The food didn't really live up to the hype of a 4.5 star burrito joint though and the price was slightly higher than a great hole-in-the-wall type Mexican place."}
{"text":"My local burrito joint!  Great house made product, unique flavors great staff- only down side is if you want a fast burrito this is not the place everything is cooked over direct heat rarely \"nuked\" so be sure you allow a bit of wait time- well worth it."}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about this place and unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. I stopped by on Sunday and ordered 2 burritos to go. I was told it was going to be a 15 minute wait. I don't mind waiting for good food, so I placed my order and waited. My order was brought out to me and I raced home in extreme anticipation. Both burritos were wrong. My bf got chicken, beans, rice, sc, guac, cheese and lettuce. His was missing the guac, sour cream and cheese. I ordered a carne asada with everything. What I received was a carne burrito with only rice and beans. It was bland and some of the carne was gristly. The rice was overdone and the tortillas were made with waaay too much lard. Sorry, first impressions make a big difference to me and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"My co-worker suggested that i try out this wonderful place. After reading a few reviews i decided on the chorizo. The wait was a bit and the hostess offered me some chips to go. The chips were so fresh it reminded me of when me and my mom used to make them at home. Loved them.....The salsas are spicy to perfection. I will definitely make this a regular place for lunch. ....."}
{"text":"I would've given a five but the service was ehh and they didn't have horchata TBH :/ but the food was dank"}
{"text":"Best burritos ever! Really fresh, authentic ingredients and great tasting food. Their breakfast burritos are top notch, as well as their green chili. Super friendly staff and really clean as well."}
{"text":"I had the sausage breakfast burrito, with all the fixings. This is hands down the best breakfast burrito I have EVER had, and don't start me on the tortilla, that was equally just as amazing! And to top it off the homemade hot sauce was divine. I have never had a breakfast burrito that has tasted so fresh, and didn't leave me feeling like I just ate a bunch of grease!"}
{"text":"My son and I had what we think are the best breakfast burrito's we've ever eaten.  Period!  We stopped by two days in a row, since the food was that superb.    This quaint establishment appears to be a converted home, which is exactly the way you feel as you walk thru the doors.  You're immediately greeted warmly by the staff, who will answer any question you might have as you preview the menu.  Don't be shy, since as we found-out, they are very sociable with their customers.    After reading about their breakfast burritos, we just had to have these on our first trip.  The burritos come with potatoes, eggs and beans (if you want), along with your choice of meat.  My son ordered the chorizo and I ordered the sausage.  We grabbed a table and they brought a basket of chips and cup of salsa to our table.  The chips were thick and delish, while the salsa was delicious.  I'd prefer it hotter, but it was full of flavor.  Heck, I could have drank this and been a happy camper.    When they brought our burritos, the first thing you notice is their size.  These aren't your tiny little breakfast burritos like some places serve.  These are made to be grabbed with both hands and enjoyed.  They are also stuffed full with ingredients, so you'd better bring your appetite.  The chorizo was super flavorful and the sausage was also really good.  We were both quite stuffed as we \"rolled\" out the door.    We went back the next day to enjoy lunch, since we didn't get enough the first time.  My son ordered the Enchilada Special and I opted for the 3-Taco Special.  My son's enchilada plate plate took-up the entire plate.  Not to mention the enchilada's were so tender and flavorful.  The red sauce was awesome.  I ordered two of the pork green chile taco's and one carne asada.  The pork green chile is as good as everyone says it is, if not better.  I could literally eat this every day.  The carne asada was tender and flavorful too, so I felt I got the best of both meats.    The service is amazing and the staff are super friendly.  Did I mention how reasonably priced this is as well?  If I'm in the Phoenix area again, I know where I'm going to get a fabulous meal."}
{"text":"Súper friendly, however I was super disappointed with the food. I ordered carne asada burrito and they forgot to add guacamole and it seemed like a majority of it was rice. I didn't even know the burrito had rice , I was under the impression it was beans and Carme asada."}
{"text":"Happened on to this place because one of our favorite breakfast burrito places closed.  Omgoodness,  fabulous smothered green chile breakfast burrito!  The people are awesome.  Definitely,  a new favorite! ! The ingredients are very fresh,  the place is clean.  I loved that they used fresh jalapeños . Just can't say enough about this little diamond in the rough. Love it."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Really good carnitas burrito, they do put rice in the burritos but you can get it without. I usually ask for easy rice but I like it. The house breakfast burrito is a must have for the mornings."}
{"text":"I feel like I wasted $28. I ordered a red chili burrito, a chorizo and egg burrito, a cheese crisp, and chips. The red chili burrito was for me. There was more rice and beans than meat in it. The tortilla was hard. I really didn't care for the taste at all. My daughter enjoyed her chorizo and egg. The salsa is super watery. The chips are thick cut which I don't care for but that's pure preference. I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I live a few minutes away and am horrified I only just found out about this place!!! The food is outstanding, my usual has been a Carne Asada Burrito with all the usual inside (pinto beans, rice, sour cream, cheese) the meat is flavorful!! Yesterday I tried the Pork in Green Chile Burrito...hold me down it was fantastic!!! The prices are super reasonable, the place is incredibly clean and I am greeted like family, really....the coolest people I have come across!!! I love this place and make it there for take-out more than once a week."}
{"text":"PHX Burrito House is damn good. Their burritos are massive, flavorful and filling. I can speak on behalf of the meatless burrito-I usually get all the other fixings/ black beans + avocado and no sour cream stuffed inside a delicious flour home made tortilla and I've never been let down. My boyfriend loves the red chili one. The chips and salsa rock too. If you're looking for a tasty PHX burrito, this place is it."}
{"text":"My roommate  and I went to the PHX Burrito House for dinner. I ordered the shrimp burrito and it was really good they do NOT skimp on the shrimp at all. The service was great plus the layout and art is really cool! looking forward to trying something else on the menu but it was worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had! The Carne Asada is amazing!! Salsa, perfect amount of spice/flavor! And customer service is phenomenal. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"So disappointing... Got the chicken burrito, they forgot to include the cheese and sour cream. Burrito was smaller than Chipotle for $7 and leaked from a tear in the bottom. Meat lacked flavor and pinto beans were soggy. And I waited 20 minutes to get my food. So disappointing"}
{"text":"Here's the thing. I recently moved from Albuquerque, which is better known as the Land of Breakfast Burritos. While I understand that the level of green chile quality that I am looking for will not be found in this neighboring state, I have been on the lookout for a burrito that can satiate my with-drawls since moving to Phoenix. This is not the place. The inside of the burrito was extremely dry and had very little flavor. I got a potato, egg and cheese to go. The tortilla was also less than perfect, as it was very chewy. At first, I thought the addition of the salsa was strange, but a nice addition. However, I have now come to understand that the salsa is completely necessary in order to eat the burrito as it adds the much needed moisture and flavor that the burrito by itself is missing.  I will say that the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. When the girl asked me if two salsas would be enough, I thought she was trying to be nice, \"who would actually need more than two?\", I naively thought to myself. You would ideally need about 6 to smother the burrito in to make it palatable. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. I will say that the tacos look good. Possibly burritos just aren't this establishments strong suit."}
{"text":"I had the carnitas burrito and Sis had the machaca special. The Machaca was good and tender, but not the best I've tasted. The machaca burrito was jam packed with potatoes and eggs which made it overwhelming. I'm talking Scooby and Shaggy overwhelming. Either share it or order while starving. The carnitas burrito had great flavor but the meat was a little dry. I suppose that's why you receive  the generous servings of salsa. I think this restaurant is very generous with the portions, has wonderful customer service and is has the bang for your buck. I don't mind returning to taste other menu items. There is a lot of potential here."}
{"text":"Spent some time in Phoenix for work training and stumbled across this little joint on Yelp. Location is smaller and the parking lot is pretty tiny but other than that this place is incredible! The first time my group went we tried the pork with green sauce tacos, carne asada taco and a shredded beef burrito. Everything was amazing and beyond satisfying. Second visit we all got burritos of some variety and chips and guacamole. The carnitas may have been the best carnitas I've ever eaten and the chips and guacamole were spot on. If I ever find myself in Phoenix again I'll be stopping here"}
{"text":"Just tried the vegi burrito (loaded) and a red chili taco.  The continued 5-Star rating should tell you something.  They were fantastic.  Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place for a weeknight dinner treat!  Everything my partner and I have tried has been fresh and delicious. My personal favorites: red chili burrito, the enchiladas (when available), and their guacamole. Try them! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Phx Burrito House has quickly become one of my favorite lunch spots. The restaurant is clean and comfortable, the staff is helpful and friendly and the food is excellent in both quality and taste. The breakfast burrito is unparalleled. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had a beef with red chili sauce burrito, which was great and flavorful. You need a knife and fork to tackle these burritos, packed full of goodness and fresh ingredients!   I'll be back again to try some more items, staff was friendly and accommodating, parking and dining spaces are a bit slim, but grab your order to go, its all good!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos all day! Would like to have double corn tortillas for the tacos though. They just fall apart with one tortilla, but still great food cooked to order."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best place in Phoenix to get a great burrito. The place is an old house with a small dining area inside for those warm Phoenix days but has seating outside for those perfect nights. When it's comes to their burritos they are amazing. I've tried them all and I have to recommend the pork in been chile. It's one of my favorites. I haven't tried their breakfast yet but it's next up. Service is quick and they have great customer service."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian by any means, but I got the veggie breakfast burrito on Saturday, and it was amazing--especially for $4! Very filling and full of all kinds of vegetables--not just onions and the cheap stuff. I had a red-chile pork burrito here several weeks ago, and it also was perfect. I love this place and can't wait to go back! The staff all are very friendly, too."}
{"text":"A must stop for us! One of our favs! The green chili burrito is bomb! Service is always excellent & restaurant is always clean. Good proportions."}
{"text":"I absolutely love PBH! I can't rave enough about their burritos! Their asada is delicious and their tortillas are the best in the valley in my opinion. Oh, and their red salsa is SOOOOO good... basically, everything there is delicious. I haven't strayed away from burritos but would guess everything is amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent spot. I debated long and hard between burrito and tacos, but when the guy told me I could get different meat in each of the three tacos I knew I had made the right choice. I got the green chili pork, shredded beef and carne asada.  They were all excellent, but note that two of them come with cilantro and onions (not the green chili pork). It's hard to say which was my favorite...I'd probably order all three again.  They are full of meat and a decent size, so three tacos and no sides was plenty to fill me up.  I would love to stop by here again!"}
{"text":"Yum. I had the pork and green chile burrito. It was the best burrito I can remember having.  The pork was tender and lean, and the whole thing had so much flavor. The tortilla was fresh and homemade and delicious. It was so good I didn't bother adding any salsa, and I usually add a ton of salsa to a burrito. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Inexcusable slow takeout service, time and time again.   It is insane that it could take 40 minutes to get a burrito and quesadilla. Keep in mind all three times I was there it was 7:30pm or later, and was slow. There is a serious kitchen issue at this place. 2/3 times the food was very good so I tried to overlook how gotdamned slow the place is, but tonight was slow and poor quality- and like my boys Hall & Oates- I can't go for that.   If the owners don't invest a little time and attention to this place- soon it will be known as the place that used to be phx burrito house. Pull it together and do it quickly. I want them to succeed but life is too short for a 40 minute burrito."}
{"text":"By far the BEST green chili burrito in Phoenix!!! You have to get one!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken burrito- very tasty with the perfect amount of sour cream and a good deal of meat.  Tortilla was a little undercooked but I was happy to know it was fresh!  Hubs had carne asada burrito and he liked it a lot.  Very flavorful meat but not tender enough for me.... Salsa had a good kick and the chips were good but not warm.  We'll definitely eat here again!  The service was really incredible.  The woman treated us like we were there every night for dinner.  She was incredibly attentive to everyone in there and was commenting on people's new hair styles and everything.  You could tell she knows the regulars and that was so refreshing... It's the kind of service you expect in melrose and being that the place hasn't been there forever it was great to see it!!   Big I could rate on service alone I would give 5 stars... But for a burrito place I'd say it was not incredible not worthy of revisiting."}
{"text":"AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS Burritos, the reviews do not lie they really are stupidly good. The only thing is that they are SLIGHTLY small, I wish they were just a TAD bigger since you're paying about $7~8 for just the burrito. Maybe if they gave you some chips and Salsa, because their salsa is also stupidly good.   As long as you're not starving and have a huge appetite I'd say this is probably the best burrito you'll ever have."}
{"text":"Excellent food and cool relaxing atmosphere.    Priced right!!   Burritos and chips and salsa perfecto"}
{"text":"Great little spot. They have a nice house hot sauce that sweet and hot. Burritos are really good. Good selection of Mexican beers and glass bottle soda."}
{"text":"If you blink you'll miss the place. It's small, clean and interesting. The food is good. My husband had the chile relleno. It was very tasty, with sauce having  a roasted chile flavor. The beans are also good but the rice needs to be better. Rice lacks flavor and appeal. The carne asada burro doesn't look like much but it is good. The meat is tender and has flavor to it.  The temperature of the food is HOT!You have to pay for chips and salsa. The salsa was very good. Bottled beer and soft drinks are sold as well as Mexican juices. The jamaica was exceptional. Service is good. Only saw two men running the place, and must admit, they did a great job......Gracias!"}
{"text":"Shrimp Burrito is the way to go. Don't drive past those place it more than worth the stop."}
{"text":"Just when I thought it couldn't get any better: the carne asada burrito is the best burrito I have ever eaten. This place has the perfect formula and consistent quaility. They are just really good people running the place too.  I argue Best Burrito in Phoenix hands down!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good place for authentic burritos and guess I found it!  I had a grilled chicken burrito with black beans. Very tasty!  Also tried the chips and salsa. Chips were fresh and the salsa had just enough kick!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has an extremely legit bean burrito. Their tortillas are straight fire. Reasonable prices. Staff is friendly. It feels good giving your business to places that actually deserve it. Yes, sir. I would like another."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for an amazing breakfast burrito!! They taste amazing and they are huge! The service is also great, a very friendly and welcoming little place."}
{"text":"Now serving beer and margaritas!! Menu on the weekends and gotta get the flan!! Stay tuned for happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"What a great little joint! HH - 2:30 - 5:30 pm. Margaritas! Food - I tried the carne asada burrito and let's just say I found a new go to stop for me. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I often want a great burrito..and am drawn to filibertos or juliobertos...with trepidation...knowing that its going to be a gut bomb and I am going to pay for it later. Not so with PHX Burrito House. High quality ingredients. Great fresh meat. Their tortillas are even hand made. You can TASTE the difference in a hand made burrito. The only bummer is that the close early on Sunday and Monday...but I guess they need a break too. Do yourself a \"flavor\" (you see what I did there) and get a burrito now."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and great breakfast burritos for reasonable prices. I got a sausage, egg, cheese and potato burrito and my husband got the breakfast house favor to with carne asada. The meals came with red salsa which is delicious; make sure to ask for the green salsa as well. I was a little surprised at how busy they were on Sunday around 11:30, but happy to see its a popular place! We will be back"}
{"text":"This is our go to burrito place!  Tortillas are awesome!  I love getting the Veggie and my boyfriend loves the green chili pork!  Breakfast is also really delicious!  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very close to my place so is very convenient. I wish I could give 3.5 stars because it is definitely better than an average burrito place.  I have tried various burritos but fish tacos remain my favorite. They seem to use white fish which doesn't have a distinct flavor so you will essentially get flavors from their sauce and slaw. They don't try to be too fancy with their burritos which works very well for me. I rather taste clean flavors than a mishmash of different sauces.   It is a reliable go-to place when you want something filling and pleasantly flavorful."}
{"text":"Great place! There's a great guy who works there, David, who has a very hospitable welcoming personality. I tried the shrimp burrito and it's tasty. Will definitely be back. It needs a sign out front of the store because right now all it says is its in the building where the old fry bread house used to be. But definitely step inside! It's also very clean!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious. But what would expect with fresh ingredients. I loved the \"Special Import\" Pepsi from Mexico. Its been to long since I've had Pepsi from a glass bottle. I will definitely be coming back here and letting everyone know about it."}
{"text":"My favorite burritos here are the breakfast burritos with bacon potato and eggs. The one with sausage is decent but I like the bacon one better. It was hot and fresh took about 15 minutes to prep...so expect that! I'd pass on the Carne Asada Burrito to be honest, you can get a better one in Phoenix at other places I'm sure and I compared it to the last one I had in Tempe.   The owners are friendly, but its kinda pricey, I wish it came with chips. Overall, fat burritos, clean and a cool place to check if in the area!  3 STARS"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY MOUTH WATERING.  Yes, that's all that I should have to say, but for the sake of my readers, I'll explain a little more in detail.   Wow, just wow. I've been craving a burrito (breakfast burrito, at that) for two weeks now. As I was hesitant on deciding where to go (i hate ruining a craving buzz) I came upon this place on yelp & made it a mission to head here before returning back to Tucson. I am EXTREMELY glad that I did.   My husband and I just wanted something we could share, but in the end I really wish I hadn't! It was THAT good. I stayed outside with our pup, so I was a little nervous on what he ordered. Luckily, he ordered exactly what I wanted.   He ordered us the Breakfast Burrito w/Chorizo as his choice of meat. It was to die for! It came perfectly wrapped (& by this I mean, for ONCE I didn't make a mess because of an opening in my tortilla - we all know what I'm talking about). It was completely stuffed with chorizo, cheese, black beans, green peppers, potatoes, & onions.   It's definitely something that will be forever remembered & craved for."}
{"text":"Had three carni tacos. They were very good. For the price it doesn't get much better. They did a good job on the menu design as well."}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options here. My veggie taco was very fresh, and the salsas were tasty. We loved the old school vibe of the place too."}
{"text":"The burritos are delicious! And I loved the service. The salsa is in high demand and they know it. No need to fear though because if you are eating in you can always ask for more for free. I could not hold a conversation while eating my carne asada burrito because it was so tasty. I also had a hard time looking up from my guacamole and salsa chips. My only question is: How do I get this place to relocate closer to my house so I can walk over everyday and get a burrito?!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out twice.  The first time it was in the morning with the family and the second was with my husband at lunchtime.   The good: Fresh ingredients and well priced The bad: The food was just ok (relatively bland).  The first time, it took over 30 minutes for our food to come out (which is always fun with little kids...) but the second time it was a bit faster.  With so many fantastic options for Mexican food in the valley, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Nice place. Not overly impressed. Salsas we're good. Even though I asked for minimal rice on the burrito the rice and beans so overwhelmed the meat that I never really tasted anything unique or tasty the about the carnitas. The staff were very subdued. I will give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Green chile Verde Burrito. Yum! All there food is  great and the staff is always friendly. So happy to be living so close now! Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Delicious carne asada and chicken tacos! Looking forward to going back soon and trying the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"i think alot of comments that give this place 4 or 5 stars are not of LATIN culture.  i had read great reviews, and my husband wanted a green chili burrito, i was not wanting to drive to our usual spot on deer valley given, we live 20 minutes south. so i tried this place, i was given a sample per the fact i wanted to make sure it came in actual chile verde sauce so the sauce was delicious, so i went ahead and ordered 3 burritos. i got home and was looking forward to it, like i said, the sauce was GREAT! so we unwrap to eat and the person who rolled the burritos need to take a lesson from the woman in my family. anyways, we ate.... and something just was... a little off... it was about the 3rd or 4th bite in that it clicked... the meat in that burrito taste like CANNED MEAT! the way it fell apart, the pink processed look to it... it was completely canned meat!!!! NEVER AGAIN! WASTE OF 25$"}
{"text":"First visit and I really like this place. They made my meal to order. I just said I want a plate with rice beans and meat and they had no problem with that even though they are a burrito taco joint. The red salsa is very good. My meal was fresh and delicious. The service was good. If you are in the area you should stop at the Burrito House. Come eat here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to come here on my trip to Phoenix, so we made sure to stop by before we headed out to a Rangers Spring Training game. It pretty easy to miss if you're going by your phone's GPS directions, but there is a giant sign out in front.   Anyway, when we arrived, it was pretty crowded. There were people waiting for to-go orders. There's also a little patio area where a few people were sitting.   I ordered a chicken burrito. It comes with everything I could want on a burrito... Rice, beans, sour cream, and cheese. That's what I always get when I order from a place like Chipotle. Also ordered margaritas which were a little pricey (I believe they were $7 each), but they were good.   It took a bit for us to get our food. The man stated it was because they ran out of tortillas (seems a bit odd to run out of tortillas at a burrito restaurant, but it's all good). My burrito was awesome. The meat was grilled perfectly. The sour cream and cheese really set it off. The tortilla was thin, but it had good flavor.   I'm glad we checked this spot out. It was a really good start to the day."}
{"text":"Ok, this is the kind of neighborhood place where people care about customer service, and care even more about the food they're making.   Came in on a whim. While I waited for a to-go order, the guy behind the counter generously brought out a little sampler of homemade chips, red chili beef and green chili pork to try. It was so delicious I almost asked my boyfriend if he wanted to order another burrito to split ... then I was like, girl, calm down. No one's going to keep you from coming back."}
{"text":"Holy shrimp burrito, you have totally won over my heart! You guys - if you're a burrito lover, PBH does NOT disappoint. We'll literally drive across town for one of these bad boys. It is a no frills, order-at-the-counter joint, with really delicious Mexican food. I'm typically a carne asada girl but not here! The first time I went, I was told to get the Shrimp Burrito and i've never looked back. The shrimp burrito has avocado, lemon juice, cabbage, pico, and hot sauce. Yup, sounds basic right? But it is seriously a tastebud party. DEFINITELY stop in the next time you're nearby, you wont be disappointed! And if you're normally a meat gal like me, step outside of your comfort zone and give the shrimp a try. I also love their salsas!"}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food, I highly recommend this place! Their burritos were absolutely phenomenal! Their chips are homemade so they are extremely tasty as well! It can be a little hard to find this place because it kind of looks like a little house from the outside. It also has limited seating so it would be best to go during non busy hours! It really was one of the best burritos I ever had!"}
{"text":"Great Food, fresh and tasty!! Not just another Burrito! Family owned and run I really enjoy the experience of Burrito House. My wife and I love it!"}
{"text":"Cute small lil place. Loved the decor inside \"la loteria\". The carnitas burrito with refried beans, rice, sour cream & cheese was BOMB!! totally recommend and will be returning to try their other meat burritos. The portion is huge for the price. Fish tacos weren't as amazing as thought."}
{"text":"Ordered the Carne Asada burrito and added Guacamole. It was suppose to have cheese beans rice and sour cream. Never saw the sour cream, I guess there was carne asada in it, but it mostly just beans and rice and the guac I paid extra for was barely in there. Wish I went to Chipotle. The chips I ordered we're good and the salsa did taste well. I liked the multiple types of hot sauce to choose from as well."}
{"text":"You will get no argument from me that PHX Burrito House has solid food.  My first time here confirmed that much.  That said, two aspects of this place were a little off putting to me.  The prep time, and the portions.  With all the Mexican food spots as well as national goliath Chipotle dotting the valley landscape, you'd better be doing everything right to thrive in this saturated burrito market.  From where I stand, this place will have an uphill battle.  A solid overall Yelp rating was what brought me here on my way home from work on a Thursday afternoon.  Its a cute spot right in the heart of the Melrose neighborhood.  I believe Fry Bread House used to be here once upon a time.  There's seating both inside and out, but only for probably about 25-30 at most. I got here around 4pm and the place was pretty dead so I figured I'd grab a few of their items super quick and be on my way.  Not so much.    I ordered their Shrimp Burrito (which includes chips and salsa on the side) and a plain quesadilla to go.  Total cost was $14.  I sat up front thinking they'd be able to get my food done super quick (since there was only one other person in the restaurant).  5 minutes.  10 minutes.  Finally, just over 15 minutes later they had my food ready to go.  The woman up front was plenty friendly, though didn't seem apologetic about the wait.  I guess this is the normal prep time?  I can only imagine what the wait would be like when its busy.  Alright the food.  When I opened up the bag of goodies, the portions weren't what I expected.  For comparison, I would say the burrito I got here is probably about 2/3rds the size of what you'd normally get at Chipotle.  The quesadilla and even the bag of chips they included were also smaller than what a Chipotle would offer by comparison.  That said, the shrimp burrito I got was awesome.  The texture of the tortilla was perfect.  It had plenty of shrimp, avocado, cabbage, pico de gallo, and a surprisingly potent hot sauce.  Very satisfying.  The quesadilla as well as the chips and salsa were also quite good too, though I've certainly had better elsewhere.  So I guess in summary, 4 stars for the food itself, but 2 stars for the rest of the experience.  I'd probably come back if asked, but I would never go the take out route here again.  I suppose their sole focus might be just on those who choose to dine in, rather than those who want to grab and go.  They have other offerings including tacos, some baked pastries and even a decent Mexican beer selection that would probably make this a cool place to hang out with friends.  But for the same price, you can probably get better bang for your burrito buck at Chipotle and other valley Mexican establishments."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp.   Holy cow.  The food is outstanding!   Coming back again before I leave town.   Gem find!  No frills. Great food and service"}
{"text":"If you look at their website and yelp info, it says they're open on Mondays, but when you get there, a note in the window says they're closed.  They obviously have zero respect for their customer's time......what a waste."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I can conclude from eating at the Mexican places that are most highly rated on Yelp, it's that white people have very bad taste for Mexican food. With the endless Mexican food options in Phoenix, it is this place and Santos Lucha Libre that are listed in Phoenix's top 5 restaurants. The latter was terrible, but PHX Burrito House seemed promising. Would this be the most disappointing week yet in my still-young Mexican food tour?   Unfortunately, yes.  PHX Burrito House is situated in the former digs of the also-overrated Fry Bread House. I will admit, the idea of burritos in an old converted house is pretty cool (maybe that's why this place has such rave reviews?). I looked at the menu, and it was sparse. Great! A place like this should have a sparse menu.  The list of ingredients in the burrito, however, concerned me a little bit. Rice, choice of pinto or black beans, meat, sour cream. Guacamole extra. What? Rice? Really?  I trudged ahead anyways. Got the carne asada burrito with guac. With a bottle of Fanta (no Jarritos?).  Almost $11.  Everything was just OK. The chips were OK. The burrito was just OK. Sorry, but it's hard to get excited about a burrito where 50% of the mass is rice and 40% is beans. I think there was a piece of actual carne asada in every third bite. Guac was relegated to a little vein near the outside of the burrito. Sour cream was only noticeable when I got to the bottom, where all the liquids inevitably end up.  It's pretty disappointing when I leave a place with the feeling that I could have gotten a better burrito at Filiberto's.  I've probably said this before, but if you want a sure-fire way to ruin a burrito, put a crap ton of rice in it. It's just filler. Would I eat here if I live in there area? Maybe.. But probably not, there's a Filiberto's across the street, and if I want a bad burrito, I might as well only spend four bucks on it."}
{"text":"Best Burrito I've had in my life!! Literally ate that thing in under 5 minutes...food was great, service was excellent, everyone was so friendly and the place was very clean......definitely coming back soon"}
{"text":"Great burritos! I love the pork in green chili burrito! Staff is friendly. Takes a little time to get the food. But it's worth it!!! Great atmosphere and drink selection."}
{"text":"Excellent carne asada burrito with a cold Corona.   I've heard this place was good for a while and so finally I decided to stop in over the weekend for a burrito and a beer. PHX Burrito House is in Melrose, with a surprisingly decent size parking lot in front.   The service was pretty good, although you should be prepared to wait more than a few minutes for your food to arrive. But when it did, it was definitely worth the wait. The food was excellent and the beer was nice and cold.   Great weekend lunch spot, I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Very good food, a tad bit pricey but very good burritos great enchiladas and excellent Jamaica"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant! Glad we used yelp to find this place when we were looking for a gluten free spot to eat while we were visiting the area.   1/2 order of chips and salsa - delicious  Shrimp quesadilla - Awesome! Shrimp was grilled, couldn't have been better!   3 taco meal - 2 chicken, 1 carne asada all were great! I only got meat and cheese because that's how I like them, but they were great.   Chicken enchilada meal - great but beware the enchiladas are spicy! The chicken is also chunk not shredded which was totally fine for us. Refried beans were great!    All around great place and would definitely recommend and we would come back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Best burrito place in Phoenix! They are friendly, fast and their tortillas are made in house which is the best part in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! I had the breakfast burrito with eggs, jalapeños, onions, & carne asada for $7. Awesome! Plus they have like five different choices for hot sauce/salsa! Must try at least once! You will become a regular in no time!"}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada burrito and chicken quesadilla. It's really good! The burrito is really chunky! YUM! I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place feels like home.  The staff was knowledgeable and welcoming and before we even got our food my husband said, \"we're definitely coming back here\".  We had the Green Chile pork burrito.  Flour tortillas were fresh, the green Chile had just the right amount of bite and we washed it down with horchata perfection.  Love it!  On a scale of 1 - 10, this place is an 11!"}
{"text":"We ordered to go from PHX Burrito House to take for a \"picnic\" before going to the Science Center. It was awesome! The kiddos had a bean & cheese burrito and a cheese quesadilla. Simple and delicious. My better half had a carnitas burrito with black beans. The meat was delicious & fillings were all of great quality he said. I had an amazing Veggie burrito that is my new favorite food! Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Best meal of the whole trip!  I had ordered their Chirizo, eggs, potato, cheese, grilled onions and refried beans...10 out of 10.  What put it over the top was the house salsa that it is served with.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Having a weekend getaway in downtown Phoenix for an exclusive Halloween party tonight and decided to try a new lunch spot. My carne asada homemade burrito was amazing. You gotta try it.  Yummo. #burritolove"}
{"text":"This was a cool little place with a wonderful feel. The man at the counter was extremely personable and helpful.  I ordered the shrimp burrito- sounded better on the menu than it actually tasted. It was mostly cabbage, I did not see any avocado and there was only 7 small shrimp in this very large burrito. My friend had the carne asada burrito- the steak was very good. It was a much better choice. I will likely return to try the breakfast burrito. Those also looked good on the menu. I'll give it a shot."}
{"text":"We just moved to the neighborhood yesterday and saw PHX Burrito House on a little drive to check things out. The decor in this place is perfect- I love the loteria posters and everything else is just minimal enough to show how spotless it is. The woman at the front (the owner?) greeted us really warmly and then gave us some recommendations- pork green chile burrito and shrimp burrito- and we took her up on the recommendations and I'm so happy that we did. So delicious! The pork was not fatty at all, not too spicy, and the pinto beans complimented it perfectly. The shrimp burrito really blew me away though. Huge chunks of avocado! Perfectly balanced pico and cabbage! And the shrimp were deveined, always a bonus when you forget to ask. We're a five minute walk from this place and it's going to be our new favorite. Sorry about the hideous photo. Not a great good photographer it turns out."}
{"text":"It's just like going to your abuela's house for a meal. The food is fresh and delicious (best carnitas around) and the service is so friendly. After we placed our order my daughter asked how I knew the cashier. I didn't know her, but she treated us like we were family. Three of us ate  with drinks and the chips and salsa appetizer  for about $25. The dining room is clean and although it looks very small from the outside, there is plenty of space to enjoy your delicious food."}
{"text":"I tried a ham breakfast burrito and it was good! My only complaint would be the wait to get the food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite kind of restaurants--they only do a few things,  but they do them  really, really well! And to have non-greasy but still tasty Mexican food is a wonderful treat."}
{"text":"I work down the street for Uhaul and was looking for a good burrito place near by. 1st time here and it was amazingggg. I ordered a burrito smothered with the pork chille sauce and got a fountain dribk, chips and salsa. $16 but it was a ton of food! Only ate half. Yummy!!! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"**IMPROVEMENT NEEDED** By curiosity as to what replaced The Fry Bread House, I stumbled across this place. I was very optimistic and excited to try. The restaurant is very hip and inviting and the owners are extremely nice people! I ordered the green chili pork burrito (in which I read came with rice, beans, cheese, and sour cream inside) so I'm thinking it's going to be \"sort of\" like Chipotles. We waited 20-25mins and nothing came out, while others got their food. I finally asked the owner if they forgot my order and he brought it out in less than 3 mins and apologized for forgetting. Yet no biggy for me since I'm a very understanding and patient person. However, the burrito was a decent size but the ratio of ingredients were WAY off, it should have been called a rice and bean burrito with green sauce because I couldn't find more than two small pieces of pork. So in other words, the green chili pork (which is the star of the show) was replaced by rice and beans. Now don't get me wrong, the food was tasty and fresh, and they did give complimentary chips and salsa which were delicious but they have a few things to improve on before I give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"One of the best burrito I've had in a long time the service was excellent the guy at the counter was so friendly we ordered the red chili carne asada burrito  and it was the best it's a small restaurant very clean I will be going here more often for sure"}
{"text":"This place is the best! I've been coming here for 3 months and have never been disappointed.  The food is great and the service can't be beat. It might take a few minuets to get your food, that's only because it's made fresh to order."}
{"text":"My Lord, everything was perfect, from the sweetest woman at the cashier to the savory chili Verde burro. Small cozy joint with wonderful people, great service, delicious food, & great prices. They make their own horchata but they were out when I arrived. Bummer but that means I'll just have to come back!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp as it was close to my hotel and some Mexican sounded good. Reviews were good, so I set off into 96 degree weather and walked over. Would have been hard to fine if I hadn't had directions, but the food was great and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I had the carnitas burrito which was fresh and amazing. Their homemade hot sauce was superb as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love their breakfast burritos! Great food. Great people. Authentic cooking. Nothing more to ask for."}
{"text":"This place is bomb dot com! I just moved to the general area and a friend of mine recommended this place to me. I'm glad he did! I'll be honest, I tried the carne asada quesadilla and I just wasn't impressed. Kinda reminded me of when I was back in college and would get a quesadilla from the cafeteria. But the burrito! Whoa! It was absolutely delicious! Such simple ingredients, but the flavor is over the top! I've definitely found a new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Great food, great people. Best green chile burrito I've had in the valley! Stop in now!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, lots of choices and a friendly staff make this a sure bet. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast burrito and Mexican Coca- Cola from the bottle!! Place is cute inside. I gave it 3 stars cause parking isn't the greatest. Place gets very busy during lunch time so best to call ahead."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim because my favorite Mexican restaurant was closed. The service is excellently done the food was pretty good however it wasn't worth the price. My mom paid 8 bucks for mediocre guac which is just outlandish. I don't think I will be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Yum!  We stopped in this weekend for lunch after reading the rave reviews and were not disappointed.  We grabbed a table out front and brought our furry friend.  We enjoyed the grilled chicken and carne asada burritos.  Both were fresh, flavorful and quite big.  Everything was freshly made and you could tell as there was no oil or grease.  Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Small place with totally homemade food, from the chips and salsa to the awesome flour tortillas used in their burritos.  I had the pork carnitas burrito, my husband had shrimp burrito ... we were both very happy with the taste, quality and value of our order.  The staff is friendly and helpful; they want you to be pleased!"}
{"text":"Have been back sense the issue last time.  Owner called and apologized for the issues.  Like I said before the food is great and the customer service used to be amazing.  I'm hoping I just got caught them on a couple bad days.  We all have them.  Got a burrito today, order was right and CS was great."}
{"text":"First try here I had the shrimp burrito. Was full of cabbage, a bit dry and not too flavorful.   2nd attempt was the Carne Asada Burrito. Much better! I had mine with pinto beans, guac and sour cream. It was a bit too 'soupy' in texture for me. Next time I'll try without the beans..  Tortillas are delish. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Very nice staff. Very fresh and fragrant food. I had a burrito shrimp he was delicious. We both enjoyed it. I recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Excellent! I was really wanting a good burrito and found this on Yelp. Not disappointed at all! Way better than Chipotle!"}
{"text":"When I learned that PHX Burrito House was owned by the same folks that own El Sol Bakery and El Zocalo in Chandler I had to get over there to see if the breakfast burritos were as good. They are. We were frequent customers when we lived in the East Valley. Looking forward to trying the fish tacos at lunch."}
{"text":"Best burrito I've had in the Phoenix Metro area. So fresh, so good. Friendly staff. Nice inside decor, simple. Delicious and can't wait to go back. I think the owner is the one who took our order, very nice. The meat was very good and tender/juicy."}
{"text":"I tried the breakfast chorizo burrito and it was really good. However, I had a 30 minute wait... not so good.  They did give me free chips and salsa while I waited and apologized for long wait."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, thats what I'm talking about. Been looking to try this place for a while now.  Great little spot set back off 7th ave.  Excellent little hang out in a great area.  Lots of vintage re sale around this place.  Carried out a green chili burrito on Francisco's recommendation.  Nailed it.  Great flavor and very filling.  Definitely a go to spot for me now.  Great happy hiur prices.  $3 bottled beer."}
{"text":"Went on Cinco de Mayo to get food and it was sure yummy. My quesadilla was stuffed with chicken and they brought be salsa, sour cream, and quac.  The atmosphere and people were also great!"}
{"text":"JUST OK. Not sure what all the hype is about. Was so stoked about finally going here. Upon going, I can say I would never recommend or even mention this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Read all the positive reviews and decided to stop in this evening. The owner greeted us and offered some samples that were so good! He was genuinely friendly and made me think that this is going to be a good experience. My wife had a chicken quesadilla and I had the green chile pork burrito. The food was fresh and so delicious. This will certainly be one of my regular places."}
{"text":"I've tried PHX Burrito House twice, and I think the food is above average, but not something that makes me want to return.  I have ordered the carne asada burrito (enchilada style) and a custom order breakfast burrito.  The green sauce on my burrito was way too spicy for me unfortunately, and I didn't enjoy it.  My custom breakfast burrito was okay, but they forgot the black beans.  Food is very fresh.  Love the atmosphere, but there are so many taco/burrito shops around that are similar with better tasting food."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for a quick lunch the other day.  The run down here is simple, you can choose between tacos or burritos, and a selection of meats, beans and cheese as your stuffing.  They offer classic but well done examples of burrito fillings.  Carne asada, chicken, green chile pork, red chile beef and a shrimp burrito as well, you can also opt for rice, beans, and sour cream, or just go all meat no filler, it's up to you.        My wife ordered a chicken burrito with a margarita to drink and I had the green chile burrito with a jamaica.  Starting with drinks, my wife loved the margarita, she said they didn't skimp on the tequila and that it tasted great.  As far as my jamaica, it was excellent, just the right amount of tartness smoothed out with a bit of sugar.  The burritos themselves were fantastic.  The green chille was well balanced, not spicy, but with a rich and bold flavor.  The beans and rice inside were much more then filler as well, they all tasted delicious on their own and I could easily make a meal out of them.  I did not taste my wife's burrito but from the smell, the chicken smelt well seasoned and looked moist and tender.  Considering my wife ate almost the entire thing, I'll conclude they know what they're doing.      In regards to service, the staff is great.  Our meal was out very quickly, and our server was attentive.  They even brought us out chips and salsa at one point, which I must say were on par with the rest of the meal in terms of flavor.(plus home made chips are always a huge bonus)      There's nothing I can really knock this place for.  Food was great, portions were huge and the staff was excellent.  Ill be back to try more as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burritos. Love being able to choose black beans. Fresh made tortillas are a real treat. Very friendly help."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was not disappointed!  Service was great and it was clean. I tried the pork carnitas tacos....yummm! So delicious and fresh.  I loved that they lightly pan fry the tortilla to add a little crispness to it.  You can tell everything is made in house. My kids had burritos, one with carnitas and the other with chicken, and they really enjoyed them.  They carry Mexican Coke which is a must at any Mexican restaurant in my opinion.  And the prices are on point!   $7 for a huge burrito and $6.75 for a plate of tacos. Very filling!"}
{"text":"Awesome chorizo burrito. Gotta love a place that serves breakfast all day. Stopped in because of the yelp reviews. If I lived closer I would come back because burritos are My favorite food. Too bad :("}
{"text":"Love this place! Just moved to the Phoenix area. So glad we stumbled upon this little place. House made chips and salsa, happy hour, and authentic Mexican dishes. Great spot before the game at Chase."}
{"text":"Hands down the best spot for burritos in Phoenix. The tortilla's are so soft and yummy. You can taste the quality of the ingredients with every bite. The service is always top notch and friendly. As long as we live in Phoenix, this will be our go to burrito spot."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are perfect. And this is coming from someone who wouldn't really call themselves a 'breakfast burrito kind of person.'   Because it's fresh and delicious the order can take awhile so I'd suggest ordering ahead!"}
{"text":"Amazing burritos, cheap beer and amazing service! And all in a renovated house to boot, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"I love the PHX Burrito House!! Definitely have to try the carnita tacos !!!! Friendly and chill environment!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since I moved to the area. Finally got around to it, and I was definitely impressed. Authentic Mexican food with a vibe that blends in with the surroundings. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and they were very easy to talk to. The prices are very affordable and the selection is enough, but not too much. I'm real big on Mexican food joints and how well their salsa is. This place has A+ salsa. I would recommend, and I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"My wife & I are here at least 1 a month if not more. Amazing service, like everyone treats you as if you apart of their family. I can honestly say I've never had a bad experience here. The food is awesome my usual is the grilled chicken burrito and my wife always orders the special of the day and always loves.  I love PHX BURRITO HOUSE!!!"}
{"text":"I was raised on real Mexican food so I am quite the critic when it comes to good Mexican food. This family owned restaurant makes me feel just as if I was eating at home. There was nothing at my table that did not taste good. Let's say there was not too many conversations going on when our table was eating.   A friend of mine introduced me to this local Mexican restaurant. You pull in you see a house with lots of parking in the front. You walk in and you smell a home cooked meal. The spot is trendy. Even though the menu is written on a chalk board that sits on the wall it is colorful as well as creative. The menu is simple but has the most popular Mexican food options including chips and salsa. My carna asada and chicken taco was tasty. It was so good I ate too much. The chips were fresh that I dipped into a salsa that I have never had before. For dessert I had a tasty cookie that was shaped as a Piggy called a Cocito. It is like a ginger bread cookie.   Space is limited because it is a renovated house. Everyone is really nice that works there."}
{"text":"This is my new lunch spot. PHX Burrito House is easy to access just off 7th Avenue and they have adequate parking at lunch time. I have been really focused on the shrimp tacos at lunch time but highly recommend them! They are generous and fresh and so tasty! One thing that I wish they'd work on is the price per menu. I can't eat three tacos and sides on a menu and when I order just two tacos, the friendly customer service person always apologizes to me for what she has to charge me. The place is clean and accessible and I really think they have high quality food."}
{"text":"PHX Burrito house is so good. The chicken and carne asada burrito is a must when you come here. All the salsas are homemade and The costumer service is top notch!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, staff is friendly + quick to help and offer advice.   And the tacos = Amazing  Carne Asada might be the best I've ever had. Chicken was great. Green chili was awesome.   Salas's they make there were outstanding.   Love this place already!!"}
{"text":"Excellent burritos. They have that homemade taste. I can't believe this place is down the street from my house and passed by it daily and never considered trying it until today."}
{"text":"Amazing! Stopped here during a business trip at the advice of a local friend. Tortillas are some of the best I've ever had. Next time I'm in town best believe I will work in a stop before I leave"}
{"text":"Amazing street tacos. Well definitely come back. The staff was also very polite. It was clean and they gave us free chips and salsa for being first timers."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. I think this place actually has decent food but the tortillas seem under done and the insides can be a little soupy. What drove me to a low rating, is the poor customer service I experienced when stopping for a mid shift meal.  The teenage girls who are facilitating the restaurant are rude to some and pleasant to others. I've never been to Burrito House before, but I frequent restaurants around town and can say that there are a lot better options than this stop. Chipotle actually makes a better burrito. When the cashier took my order she took my credit card and swiped it, and then lifted up the floor mat for the other girl to sweep, card in hand. I know hands can be really dirty because of things we touch, but this was just blatantly gross. Almost to the point where I was willing to forfeit the credit card and just wait for the new one in the mail. I was charged $10 for a burrito that probably should have cost $7. I sat down at a table and waited for my burrito to come while I watched another young gentleman and his older companion come in. It's interesting how different two people can be treated. I sat there and waited while my burrito was being prepared, and they actually engaged in small talk. When my burrito finally came, the girl working the register handed it to me, or should I say tossed it to me. She turned around so fast she didn't even know she had done it. The other two patrons sat down and were served their food in a different fashion than how I was served. The other girl walked over to their table and offered them complementary iced tea because they were just going to throw out the batch at the end of the night. I think they were going to close within the next 30 minutes, so they wanted to get rid of the excess but not waste it. She filled two large to-go cups with iced tea and thanked them for coming in. I had to resume working that evening so I promptly finished my meal and was about to leave , but I thought to myself it would be nice to have a little caffeine jolt before resuming my shift. I walked up to the register and was not greeted again, but given a look which meant \"what can I get for you?\" I ordered an iced tea and paid for it. I don't expect to be given an iced tea for free, but I was hoping for a smile atleast. It's not always the food you ate at a restaurant, sometimes it's how it made you feel."}
{"text":"Love the burritos, but love the service better! the lady at the front makes you feel welcome, even 10 minutes before closing. This is the only burrito joint I crave anymore. The freshest salsa too!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! The Churros are the shit! Took 10 back for my co- workers.  The burritos were super delicious as well"}
{"text":"Decent place. Atmosphere is good, parking seemed decent, but pricey for what it is. Bean and cheese burrito + chips and salsa shouldn't cost $13. Burrito was decent but you can get better quality for much cheaper elsewhere. Also wasn't a fan of the tortilla chips."}
{"text":"As I eat my burrito from this place, I wonder.. how can anyone not give this place 5 stars?! It's my favorite burrito place in Phoenix by far."}
{"text":"Best burrito I have ever had! All of the people that work here are awesome people, and David is the homie!  Great place to eat if you are In the area.. Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"We got:   Chicken burrito Meat style burrito but with no meat in it Shrimp burrito, add black beans and rice  Both the green and red salsas that came with our order were delicious. Perfectly done.  The tortillas were out of this world fresh, fluffy, heavenly. I could eat the tortilla plain and be happy.   All the burritos were delicious, I tasted them all. The shrimp burrito was what I  ate and I couldn't put it down, I inhaled the whole thing.   Mexican coke with real sugar in it was the icing on the cake.   We ordered take out over the phone and they got the order perfect.  I also want to note that although the burritos were very filling, they were not greasy at all, just perfectly cooked like a healthy meal you'd make at home for your family, but they wouldn't know that it's healthy by how amazing they tasted.   When I was craving burritos earlier in the day, I had never been to this place before, but they tasted exactly like my imaginary burrito tasted.   I'll definitely be back. The man working in the kitchen was very kind and seems like an awesome  human being."}
{"text":"Hooray for PHX Burrito House! Yes, there are a ton of great options for Mexican food in the Valley, and if you find yourself in the Melrose area looking for some hometown Mexican fare, then PHX Burrito House is the place for you.   On my last visit I went with their carne asada burrito -  savory chunks of nicely-marinated and seasoned beef with all the fixings wrapped in warm tortilla. I also added some chips and salsa. Great flavors that hit the spot. After settling for just so-so Mexican food as of late, I was happy that I came.  Staff (owner?) was beyond friendly. Wonderful service all in all.  Easy parking, freshly-made flour tortillas and salsas and GREAT hometown service make PHX Burrito House the place for me!"}
{"text":"Eat here. Just a chill place with great burritos. I highly recommend the green chile pork with rice and beans. Bonus points if you go full Mexican and order the Tamarindo aguas frescas."}
{"text":"Gross.... how can anybody say these people to serve good food. It doesn't even look like Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Great tasting Burritos ... you won't be disappointed.   PHX Burrito House is located off the beaten path in the Phoenix area.  I wanted a burrito for lunch and based on my fellow \"yelpers\" reviews I thought I would give the PHX Burrito House  a try and I was very glad I did.   All I can say is don't judge a book by its cover.  From the outside this burrito joint looks like an old house and if you aren't paying attention you will miss it and you don't want to miss this place.  Service is order at the register, then they bring your entrée to you. Customer service was really good, friendly and pretty quick.   There is a very good selection of burritos, tacos, and other popular dishes and all are reasonably priced and they taste great.  PHX Burrito house is not a fast food joint, so you get freshly made burritos that are a really good size and they are made with fresh tortillas that are absolutely delicious. The meat is tender and so flavorful. If your in the area you ha email to try this place you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Go there and get a shrimp burrito AND a chicken burrito. They are both so delicious and wonderful and different, that it's worth it to try both.  Great food, great prices, great service. Just great."}
{"text":"The food here was very average. I was under the impression that chips and salsa were free from prior reviews but they are $4. I got a carne Asada burrito and the meat was very dry and I also ordered beans in my burrito and there were none inside. According to the people I was with the chicken was also not very good. The service was not very good with the exception of one of their youngest employees (a young guy). I would not recommend."}
{"text":"PHX Burrito House! Our favorite spot for afternoon happy hour! In a perfect location within the Melrose District! We love it!   From the tacos to the burritos (obviously) we haven't been disappointed yet! Super cute family owned business and everyone is very sweet! Even their take out is perfect for busy nights where cooking just doesn't seem realistic!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and well I needed to be in and out, and this was the place I chose. I thought this place wasn't too bad, but it seems like it's definitely a popular spot. Inside, it's basically a house, with seats around in what would be the living room. I thought the price was pretty good and what you got was definitely worth looking. The only bad thing about this place is that the seating is limited.   So, I ordered the Al Pastor Burrito and also got some tacos in addition to my meal. The taste and flavor was there, but the service was a little slow. I thought the food came out a bit sluggish, but then again I can't blame them because it was during lunch hour. This place is definitely a place to check out if you're trying to find Mexican to eat. Another thing on why this place doesn't reach the top of my list is that there was a good amount of rice in the burrito which sort of turned me down. I found the interior and decor interesting and that the place is true to the name."}
{"text":"PHX Burrito House has updated its menu to now include not only chips, but quesadillas and new entree items. My one complaint was that there were no chips; now there are chips. This is, hands down, my favorite place to get Mexican food (burritos in particular). I'm telling you, those tortillas are KILLER."}
{"text":"OMG. this place is AMAZING! just finished eating the veggie burrito (minus the sour cream:)) and it was hands down the best burrito i've had since i've lived here! super fresh ingredients, including the yummy tortilla! the employees were really friendly too! i definitely recommend this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food I've had in forever! Service is awesome. Food is phenomenal! Salsa is perfectly hot like I love it. Chips and tortillas are homemade. And because we LOVE this place so much and are here at least twice a week, we are greeted like long lost friends every time we visit.   ps) we were told the liquor license was awarded and they are in the final steps of carrying delish Mexican alcoholic beverages in addition to the awesome authentic Coke in the fridge by the counter."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had in a 15 mile radius and I've tried a lot of places. The breakfast burritos and carne asada are amazing, can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Everything is priced under $10 excluding 2 of the specials, so the whole menu is really affordable and a great deal. What really kept me coming back was the service. Every time I have gone, the staff has been really friendly, welcoming and helpful. Coming from someone that works in the restaurant industry, the service is better than most and Francisco and the female server with black hair (I didn't catch her name) do a really great job. Highly recommend eating @ PHX Burrito House!"}
{"text":"These were some of the best chicken and carne asada tacos I've had. Delicious and we will visit every time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"You've been warned.  You'll want to go back.  A lot.  Your diet might not appreciate your new habit."}
{"text":"Great and very authentic flavored Mexican food!!! Excellent tacos and super good carne asada, the carnitas were also very flavorful."}
{"text":"The shrimp burrito is good.  The shrimp is very fresh and cooked to perfection.  Deep flavor is missing in the burrito though and a little spicy.  The rest of the burrito isn't as good.  4-stars.  chips and salsa are decent.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito in town! Tortillas are so fresh and delicious. Great service, reasonable prices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a pretty good burrito joint. Good meat, nice tortilla, salsa is a little spicy just the way I like it. Horchata is also really amazing as well! With the plethora of good Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, I wouldn't call this my go-to spot but they definitely have a burrito worth trying.   My main complaint is that I have gotten take out from this place twice now and both times they have messed up something. For example, today I ordered two burritos to go (not both for me, one was for my wife. Cmon, I can't eat two of these burritos..or could I?) Anyways, today they forgot to put the rice and beans in my wife's red chili burrito which was pretty disappointing. I think they just need to be a little more careful with their to go orders since this has happened twice to me now."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a month or so but it was even better than I remembered. I ordered the chicken burrito this time & it was delicious. The best burritos in town! The staff is always friendly, the place is always clean & they play great music. If you haven't been here yet you need to make it a point to visit. You will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"The Carne Asada No Filler Burrito. Enchilada Style. Welcome to burrito heaven. Best carne Asada I've had in along time."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Only the slightest bit sketch, but I took that as a good sign.  With the help of the friendly cashier I was able to decide on a breakfast burrito which was very good.  The tortilla had a really great texture and flavor and the ingredients seemed fresh.  Can't wait to try some of their other burritos and some of those cookies.  I think they're called wedding cookies, I regret not get any."}
{"text":"I love this place. The burritos are huge and the prices are great! The only thing that sucks is the  parking lot but it's worth finding a spot to have a burrito here. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Local amazing and delicious!!!!  First time here and both the service and food were fantastic!  The young lady was extremely helpful and had great recommendations.  My favorite is the shredded beef taco. It was moist tender and melted in your mouth.  I look forward to trying the enchiladas very soon!  This is a must in my Book"}
{"text":"Excellent, the whole place was clean including the bathroom.  The food was delicious.  I had the enchilada special plate, one chicken & one beef. The meat was tender and flavorful. We received complimentary chips & salsa because it was our first visit. Staff is very friendly and the atmosphere has a good vibe."}
{"text":"Phoenix burrito house is my favorite Phoenix hole in the wall! From the loteria decor, to the amazing food menu and drink options, you really can't go wrong finding something good to eat here. My boyfriend and I come as often as possible! His favorite is the carne asada burrito, mine varies between the shrimp, veggie, and shredded beef burrito! And omg... not going to lie I dream about these tortillas. Good ones are hard to find!! There are tons of hot sauce options on all the tables which I love! And to top it off the staff is always friendly, welcoming and attentive to their customers! We'll be back, always!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. It is a very small house, but they have plenty of indoor seating.  I was just looking for a quick lunch, not too filling, so I stopped by here and ordered a bean and cheese burrito. $6.24 with my tax. Woah, that's pretty pricey for a bean and cheese burrito considering for $7 I could have gotten meat, rice, and sour cream in my burrito.   My order came out in about 5 minutes. Now, there are two types of bean and cheese burritos... those who throw some cheese dead center and you only enjoy it for 1/3 of the burrito, or those who have PROPER bean and cheese distribution... this was thankfully the latter. Overall, the flavor was great. They gave me a red and green salsa, neither of which were too impressive.   Now, I cannot justify paying that much for a simple bean and cheese burrito, but I will be back to try something else!"}
{"text":"I was so curious why this place has so many reviews and stars so I had to try it to check it out for myself. It's literally in a weird location and the sign is not noticeable. Their burrito is alright. And they do not add vegetables to their burritos which is a bummer because I love vegetables! However, their tortilla is very soft and chew which I like and yeah their sauces is pretty good too. I won't pay almost 8 dollars for beans and meat, just not my way of a burrito is. This place is more \"Americanized\" than your authentic Mexican joint. If your around the area or need a quick lunch then go here, but I'm sure you'll find other places better..."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The staff is friendly and food is good. I go often and love the shrimp burrito :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, reasonably priced, friendly and quick.  If you haven't tried this place you are truly missing out."}
{"text":"Heard about this place the other day and had to try it out. Solid burrito spot that has a variety of burrito specials. It is a very small dining area so get there just before or just after lunch to find a spot to sit. I had the Carna Asada burrito and a quasadilla. The food was made fresh and was very good. One of those spots that you have to order at the counter and get served after you sit. Customer service was good for the type of place it is. I would go back when in the area and feel like a burrito."}
{"text":"I just moved in next door to the PHX Burrito House and took the opportunity to stop by after work and I wasn't disappointed! The staff was friendly and welcomed me to the neighborhood.   I wasn't sure what I wanted so they let me sample and I ultimately ended up going with the Carnitas with Green Chile. The burrito was incredible; tender pork, flavorful Green Chile sauce, tasty tortilla. The burrito was a good size as well.  If it were a buck or two cheaper I'd be a regular, but nonetheless I will definitely be back from time to time!"}
{"text":"Can't remember what the chorizo burrito tasted like because the horchata was the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice and both times the food was awesome.  I was amazed at how good the flour tortilla was on my burrito.  The owner brought our food out and talked to us for a few minutes. The staff is friendly, food is good and I am supporting a local small business which is all +'s in my book."}
{"text":"There is a reason there's over 400 reviews and still over 4 stars. Not only is the food amazing, but they treat you like family. I will recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Carne Asada burrito!!!!! They get a little busy from time to time but the food is worth the minimal wait!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix pretty much my whole life. I've had quite a few breakfast burritos, from the categories of \"I hate my life so much right now and I'm going to hate it more after this something-bertos awfulness I'll eat so I can at least live through this morning,\" all the way to burritos lovingly homemade with the many fresh ingredients cut up and grilled in front of me.  All that said: The breakfast burritos here are The Best. If I'm not out of town, I'm here at least once a weekend. Doesn't matter if it's 10am or 3pm, some day that weekend I'm devouring a breakfast burrito here. The potatoes & eggs are cooked in just the right way and amount that they're guaranteed to slay any hunger or hangover you may walk in with. The ham/sausage options are excellent, but my heart will forever be caught in the ages old battle waged between bacon and chorizo (chorizo usually wins). The red salsa just completes the masterpiece.  Not to mention, the managers/owners are kickass. If they know you, they'll probably know if you need some water, how much salsa you need, and if you want chips (without even saying it) in the morning(ish). And sometimes they'll sit down and chat with you over their own burrito.  I've grabbed tacos here a few times as well, and they're also excellent. I can't imagine these guys doing anything average."}
{"text":"Stopped here this morning to get my workers some breakfast burritos for a job around the corner. Figured Yelp couldn't be wrong with all the positive reviews. Let me just say it's probably the best breakfast burrito I've ever eaten. I wish I could magically transport this place over to Chandler!"}
{"text":"Tasty burritos on the way back to my apartment? Yes please! I always go with the carnitas burrito because it's made just the way I prefer it: tender, braised pork with a seared/crispy outside. Friendly service and decent prices (~$8 for a fairly sized burrito that fills me up) in addition to a consistently tasty burrito are what keep me coming back for more. And more. And more."}
{"text":"Fresh food! They have awesome veggie burritos! Cute decor! Staff is friendly and accommodating to vegetarians."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely horrible it had freezer burn  and they were over priced! I was going to take it back but they are closed. They charged 6.75 for 3 tacos and the tacos weren't edible."}
{"text":"Great local joint albeit a little easy to drive past since it is set back from the street edge.  I thoroughly enjoyed the fish tacos."}
{"text":"This place is absolute fire. The vibe in here is so cool and the burritos here are really good. The refried beans here are so tasty. But the most important thing is at each table they have an arrangement of different hot sauces for your burrito! Win!"}
{"text":"Dine in order: Grilled Chicken Burrito w/ guacamole added & a Mexican bottled Coke; total $10.01  Came in to a slow Tuesday evening, only one other table was being occupied. Not only was this place dead but it had no good atmosphere at all. From the young man taking the orders to one of the owners present. One could at least add some low volume music so you avoid hearing the awkward silence. This is not to say they had bad customer service just no soul / passion in the restaurant   The chicken burrito was good but sadly the overpowering of refried beans made my burrito sloppy & unwrap-able. At the end it was a soggy mess. As for the chicken I was able to take out and actually taste it was juicy and flavorful. Tortilla was a tad bit thin but didn't bother me cause I'm not particular to thick or think flour tortillas.  For what you're purchasing this place gets a 4 out of 5 stars & for the ambiance of the restaurant I give them a 2 star rating. Overall it's a 3 out of 5. My recommendation, take your food to go"}
{"text":"Food was really good. The fish tacos was taste and light."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, delicious burritos  10/10 would eat here everyday. We had shrimp and pork burritos with salsa and guac"}
{"text":"The food is authentic and always amazing. Daniel and David are always so friendly and make it a point to say hello to everyone. I'm a huge fan of the carne asada burrito and the shrimp burrito....you can't go wrong! Friendly staff, amazing food! Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Carnitas burrito is kinda bland. The fresh salsa was thin with not alot of flavor. The agua fresca was good but you get more ice than agua. It's an average place, specially since the city has so many options.  Gave 3 starts because of the good decor and beats the he'll out of filiberto's"}
{"text":"Love this place! So far everything I've tried here is amazing. I've tried the shredded beef, chorizo, and shrimp burritos. Such great flavor with every one. Chips and salsa are very tasty as well. One great thing about this place is that everything is so fresh. They have some of the best tortillas! (I tend to be picky when it comes to the them. I hate when burritos taste like they use a Taco Bell tortilla.) The shredded beef is so incredibly flavorful. I notice that at other places it tends to be dry but it's so juicy at PHX Burrito House. I can't wait to try every burrito on the menu."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sat. Really nice people and the food is very good"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and everyone is so friendly. I walked in and immediately felt at home. Food is fresh and made to order. You build it your way."}
{"text":"Burritos here overrated and expensive. Disappointed especially because it was about nine bucks for a burrito that should be about four dollars. Chipotle burritos are way better and cheaper. I got two different burritos, green chili and pork and carne Asada, both way overpriced. I'm thinking because they got popular on yelp and have a lot of Caucasian customers they will charge more. Well I think their popularity got to their heads. I don't think I'll come back. My burrito was too soggy by the way. Good salsa good chips."}
{"text":"Our new fave little Mexican food stop. We moved here from California and havent found any Mexican food we have been impressed with yet. Until now. Friendly staff, clean place, and I love the Carnitas Burrito! Mmmm, now and then they have some yummy homemade desserts up front too! Mexican Wedding Cookies, Empanadas.. mmmm. Right in the antique district so you can walk around and shop too without having to drive, several shops right around this place. Oh and the burritos are huge and packed full, be prepared to get messy!"}
{"text":"Place is neat. Service is good. Food is good. I love the breakfast burritos but the potatoes are cut to big and most bites are all potatoe. Only reason for 4 stars. Salsa is good but to watery for the burritos. I like thicker salsa for burritos. Flavors are good though"}
{"text":"Great fast food burrito place. It's cheap around 7$. The outside looks really sketchy and looks like a residential house but it is legit. The people are also really nice"}
{"text":"Red Chile Beef Burrito is amazing!  I get mine rice and beans on the side. Nice beer selection for a burrito place. A couple Mexican beers and a couple Microbrews."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for tacos, which were good.  Will stop again to try a burrito since it is the burrito house!! Very nice gal at the counter.  Quiet and parking right in front is nice.   Horchata is made in house according to the cashier, so expect rice bits in yours! A little on the sweet side for me though."}
{"text":"Best taco salad in town!  Staff/owners are super friendly.  Their ingredients are so fresh and the prices are great.  We eat here regularly since we live nearby and never have been let down.  I'd like to see more gluten free options ...but that taco salad is so good, I'm happy to eat it over and over."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant with very large and safe parking lot. Inside, very clean, friendly staff, and easy to read chalkboard menu. Menu is very simple yet provides lots of choices. Chips, salsa, and food are brought to the table.  The salsa is the bomb!  Spicy, not to chunky, and compliments the lightly salted chips."}
{"text":"I tried the famous shrimp burrito.  The shrimp were a tiny bit tough, but I loved all the textures and flavors in it like the guacamole and cabbage.  I think over $3 for chips and salsa is pretty dang steep, but the chips are thick and crispy and the salsa is very tasty.  The tortillas are what makes these burritos so good.  I can't get enough of them."}
{"text":"The photos made the food look amazing. Our group had 6 different dishes and only one was ok. The rest were not even ok. Won't be going back here"}
{"text":"Straightforward solid Mexican food in a clean place served by a very nice staff that cares about customers and their food at a good price. Great housemade salsa, guacamole and chips and a delicious burrito."}
{"text":"First stop on our vacation was this place because we heard it was very good. They gave us free chips and salsa because we were first timers.   Get the pork and green chile burrito with refried beans. You cannot go wrong ordering that. My sister got the shrimp burrito and even though it looked more like a wrap than a burrito she enjoyed it a lot. On top of good food the service was too notch."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you go to for the food and not the ambiance. The restaurant is tiny with average decorations. There is a parking lot but its small.   The prices were a bit higher than what was listed online, but its still worth it, the food is delicious.  It's some sort of hybrid between A sit-down restaurant something more casual like a cafe, which made the process a bit confusing. A sign for what is expected of the customer would be nice (e.g. please bring your plates to the counter when finished)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Favorite spot for lunch by my work. I try to go at least once or twice a week. Their tortillas are HOME MADE. Best tortillas ever. Their Carne asada is awesome. I also highly recommend the shrimp burrito. Everything here is SO good, you can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"First the burrito was ok. But certainly not 4 1/2 stars. The flour tortilla was a bit stale. I had the pork, with nothing but beans and rice no sour cream or guacamole as promised Restuarant is clean service was friendly, price was right. The problem was the burrito was not great, just good! Good value plenty of meat but not 4 1/2"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a bite during our visit to Phoenix.  I got a shrimp burrito, which was pretty good, but I basically wrote this review just to put this out there: THE CARNE ASADA here is FANTASTIC.  So flavorful, smoky, delicious. I ate a big chunk of my boyfriend's carne asada burrito on top of finishing my own shrimp burrito - no shame."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic tortillas and flavorful salsa. Always willing to accommodate my vegetarian burrito whims! Excellent service is icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Amazing shrimp burrito. Everything in it was so fresh. They didn't hold back on the shrimp there's was shrimp on every bite. The place is nice and very clean. The variety of salsas are good. This is definitely a fit burrito."}
{"text":"Carnitas pork tacos and a margarita! Just waiting to get my hair cut next door and I'm glad I stopped in."}
{"text":"Yum! PHX Burrito House is delish! I had the red chile beef tacos, and they were wonderful.  They came in soft, white corn tortillas that tasted freshly made.  My fiancé had the carne asada burrito,  and he was raving about it (he's a Mexican food snob). We shared an order of chips and salsa too.  Great chips, even better salsa (it has a kick)! Check it out!"}
{"text":"One of the best burritos I have ever had.  One thing that really stood out to me was that the rice was properly cooked and seasoned, which you do not find to often.  There are always some hard pieces due to being stale or being under cooked.  I got the grilled chicken burrito with black beans.  Everything came together very nicely and it has a unique flavor.  The only complaint I could see people having is that their salsa is really nothing special.  So if you ordered chips and salsa that might be a problem.  I did not find this to be a problem however since the burrito was flavorful enough that I did not need to drench it in salsa like I do at some other places.  Cool unique little dining area too and the employes were all very friendly.  I love places like this with simple menus, that do not do a whole lot, but what they do, they do very well.  I will be back often."}
{"text":"these burritos are wonderful, highly recommend! super cute little place also and wonderful staff. i wish i could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"Good food! And for dessert, yummy $1 churros!! Fantastic service. The girl at the register is very welcoming and helpful especially if you can't make up your mind (my problem 99.9% of the time) or it's your first time there. I will definitely come back. Don't waste your time at Filiberto's or Federico's, whatever that nasty food is across the street lol happy eating, folks!"}
{"text":"My friends recommended Phoenix Burrito House Friday night, and I went Saturday morning. I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo, cheese, and grilled onions. It was huge and delicious. I had about a third leftover for lunch/snack. I'm going back soon for the shrimp burrito!  Also, the people were nice!"}
{"text":"The carne asada burrito is NOT good. Cheap meat and rice as filler and way overpriced. Chipotle is better. Just up the street is mucho macho taco.. Go there instead or joyride or really anywhere else."}
{"text":"$5 for chips and awful salsa - No The carne asada was bland Hot sauce on the table was buffalo wing sauce, like... seriously Don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  The red chile beef is the best, but then again, everything is amazing.  Staff is so friendly too."}
{"text":"Incredibly happy to say that after trying the PHX Burrito House again, my opinion has improved! And I've discovered that I'm just really not a fan of their green chili burritos. Their verde sauce is fantastic yet the green chili is flavorless and almost creamy instead of saucy. I still found that theilre was way too much tortilla and that I'm not a fan of the flour-y-ness of their freshly made tortillas.  HOWEVER  Their tacos are pretty incredible. Especially their shredded beef and their red sauce beef tacos. The shredded beef was so juicy that the tortilla was falling apart, and the red sauce has none of the problems that the green does.   And my boyfriend tried the choriza and bacon burrito. Which was phenomenal once the grease soaked into the tortilla.   So my suggestion is to try a few things if you're unsure, grab a few tacos and a margarita and you're bound to find something you like."}
{"text":"Not bad... But not the best I've ever had. They did skimp on a few of the ingredients, but thank God they didn't put lettuce in their burrito.  Can't stand that!  The tortilla was large enough to hold more ingredients.  It was flavorful and the pork was exceptional!  I tried the horchata and I'd have to say it was one of the better ones I've tasted.  I can't quite give it 4 stars... But it's close. Needs a little refining and it would be great.   Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Have tried this place couple of time and always satisfied with the experience. Place is small-scale 20 and clearly set up for quick lunch or dinner. Great selections and multiple daily specials. You can have your burrito or tacos anyway you want-all fresh and I especially like the No Filler Burrito-lots of meat, lettuce/cabbage and pick de gallo-no gloppy beans or rice. Amazing and delightful! Not your everyday taco/burrito house and the ratings prove it-all at very reasonable prices-$8-10 for lunch with a beverage."}
{"text":"Excellent. The store looks like a small hole in the wall when you come in. The inside is very nice and clean. The bathrooms are clean.   The menu is on the wall which is neat. It is also on a pamphlet.  After ordering I asked for chips and water. The owner brought out a BIG pitcher of ice cold water with ice in it. The salsa he brought out was delicious...and SPICY. The chips were fresh, home made and very crispy. I have not had chips this good in my life.   The burrito came out shortly after the chips. The burrito was stuffed with meat. The burrito had beans in it also. There is also cheese in the burrito. It was very satisfying. It was even more delicious!! And it was super filling!  I am very happy I chose this establishment and want to come back soon!  Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"Just Amazing!!  I stumbled upon this place a couple months ago, and it has become a regular stop for me!   To put it simply, you walk into an immaculately clean restaurant, order from some great people who actually act happy to see you, and get mind bogglingly good food!!  BEST fish tacos I've found in Phoenix!  Carne Asada that's out of this world!  Pork and Green Chilis that is absolutely amazing!  Really, the Phoenix Burrito House is just the best on so many levels!"}
{"text":"Great food and great staff!!! Shrimp quesadilla and shrimp burrito were amazing!!! Fresh guacamole"}
{"text":"Im a hard guy to please when it comes to food. When they brought my burrito the first thing i could smell was the masa (dough for making tortillas. For you non spanish speaking people) on that tortilla. I dig home made tortillas, so i knew this was gonna be a great burrito. It was. Oh and they serve beer, what more could i ask for ;)"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review from the standpoint of someone who thinks Chipoltle is overrated when it comes to big,tasty burritos, because PHX Burrito House takes the cake.  I seriously don't know why any Phoenician would ever ever ever set foot in a Chipoltle when they could go here. One, it's local. Two, it has the same options as Chipoltle (rice/beans/meat/etc) and is ten MILLION times more delicious. The carne asada falls apart in your mouth and is seasoned very well. The carnitas are amazing, and one burrito was seriously the size of my face. When I dined in, I got complimentary chips and salsa and they were delicious.  Service is probably the only difference when comparing to Chipoltle. PHX Burrito House cooks up your food and brings it out to you, thus meaning it takes a little bit longer, but it's fresher. The wait can easily be avoided by calling ahead and placing a to-go order if you're in a lunch rush.   So next time you're craving a giant, meaty (or beany or veggie) burrito, skip the national chain and go to PHX Burrito House. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We love the burrito house. Owners are great, food is yummy! We eat here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Can't stop, won't stop. Twice in two weeks because they're that delish. You'll feel right at home with the great food and kind people here. Flour tortilla chips and blended salsa are just how I like and the green chile is excelled. I feel kinda bad for the empty  Filibertos across the street.   UPDATE: they now have $1 churros that are.. wait for it.. BETTER THAN DISNEYLAND'S. You heard it here first folks, Phx Burrito house is now offish the happiest place on earth."}
{"text":"The menu is simple high quality ingredients you can combine in whatever way pleases you, burrito,tacos,quesadilla....our take out order was ready fast and it was easy in and out, home in no time.  This was a really good burrito, the tortilla was perfect, sightly stretchy, chewy and warm.  The plentiful size made this a good value as well.  This place is definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"Great Service, warm welcome the cashiers are very attentive to their customers and friendly with all the questions you may have about their menu and establishment. Nice environment very clean and great music selection! The food is AMAZING! definitely some of the best authentic Mexican food you can find AZ! They use fresh ingredients and tasty meats for all of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Picked up dinner a few nights ago and still talking about the awesome burritos we had. This place is never disappoints."}
{"text":"Green chili burrito  Delicious  Why did it take so long for me to stop here? Great food"}
{"text":"Phx Burrito House is tucked away and a little unsuspecting, but the food is great, large portions, and employees are friendly."}
{"text":"All about the Chroizo+potato breakfast burrito here. Prices are reasonable and staff is friendly. Parking can be tricky during lunch hour. My wife thoroughly enjoys the carne asana burrito.   Bottled beer with a decent happy hour 2:30-5:30 at the time of this review. Beer selection is only ok. Not the best, but do have some craft options as well as some Mexican imports. They do have margaritas as well. Only food special during happy hour is nachos for $5, which I haven't tried.   Atmosphere is fine. Nothing super remarkable. Music isn't too loud, it's clean, and put together with, what I believe, are framed and blown up tarot cards on the wall, which are interesting to look at. They do have some outside seating which is super nice in the spring months.   Overall definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This food is just awesome. Cool little mom and pop feel here too. Which I love. The service is great. The lady that took my order I wish I had her name answered all my questions no problem. And over the usual these days when you ask a question people seem to he annoyed. She was more than willing to help. They off many different bean options and they have the best quesadilla I've had in a long time. And the salsa! Not as spicy as I like but it is so damn good! The green has a little more kick which I love. I reccomend this place. Eat in or take it home. A little tricky to find but once you find it you'll be back 100 times. :) our new authentic Mexican food place!"}
{"text":"I'm lucky because this place is at the end of my street. It's delicious! I'm a chip and salsa critic and I think theirs is pretty good. And the staff are so friendly!"}
{"text":"Came in here after a long night of drinking one morning and I was extremely impressed. The wait is a little long, but there is an upfront disclaimer that reads \"Please be prepared to wait as everything is prepared fresh\", yeah I'm down with that. I got the steak quesadillas and a sausage, egg, and cheese burrito. The steak was marinated with lime and was so delicious I could have eaten three more. As for the burrito, it's rare that a place can throw potatoes in and have them be light and fluffy, but these guys pulled it off.   Were it not so far from my house I'd be in more often, but maybe that's a good thing for my waist line. If you're in the area give it a try!   Ps, it's kind of tucked away in the back of a little cluster of buildings, which made it hard to find. And the Yelp pin drop may be off a bit."}
{"text":"I got the carne asada burrito with refried beans, cheese, and sour cream. They were Fast , delicious, and very hospitable! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Bomb Burritos & fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Why would anyone go to Chipotle after eating here?! Great non chain local spot in Melrose here in Central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Phoenix Burrito House is a true-to-Phoenix haven of comfort-Mexican food. It would be misleading to leave this review unprefaced with the context that I am a regular at this establishment. I know the names of the work staff. Deservedly so, I am obsessed with this beacon of warm, greasy and home-cooked grub. In the fashion of a true comfort food exemplar, this establishment is operated out of a renovated home not far from Central Phoenix. I believe all ascendant food must be delivered in a hole-in-the-wall kind of atmosphere. Phoenix Burrito House demonstrates this concept generously. The restaurant is arranged in a small domain seating at most 20 people, in what one could only assume was once a family's living room. I think that this unpretentious and casual-friendly style of delivering calories really allows the food to be put on trial - and boy - the food here is guilty. Upon entering the living room, you are received by the warm greetings of a few staff members. They welcome you in and make conversation casually. You may also be in the presence of a group of Phoenix students, a family that lives nearby, or me, all brought together by the need to satisfy your burrito craving. At this point, it is natural to be filled with Ratatouille-esque waves of nostalgia pertaining to your childhood experiences with comfort food, as you will have intaken about 500 calories at this point from the smell alone. After offering up an inconsequential $10 for your meal, and a 10-minute wait, your meal is announced to the room. My favorite, the House Special, is an anything-goes style burrito; containing crispy homefries, fresh eggs, balanced jalapeno, explosive carne asada, and caramelized onions, all wrapped in a salty tortilla. It can be what you want it to be. It has been my breakfast, lunch, and dinner. However, you must be wary! As this burrito was born into the world mere moments prior to it coming into your possession, it is often scorching hot. Unfortunately, I often lack the constitution required to resist such temptation, and I have left with a burnt mouth. As long as you heed the danger and give it patience, you will be rewarded beyond imagination. Many of the burritos here are great, but few are as well orchestrated as this. The flavors play to each others' tune like a familiar jazz ensemble. Get this burrito, and you have my guarantee you'll leave changed! All in all, I think the Phoenix Burrito House is a little slice of paradise. This is your food home and they are your food family. I work on the other side of Phoenix-Central from the Burrito House, yet all my coworkers rave about it still! It seems it has a real reputation and respect with the local community, and that sort of thing is important in the city. There are so many options, but not many can offer you good food, cheaply, conveniently and with good service. It has my respect as well!"}
{"text":"Wowzers!  This place is a winner and I can't wait to go back... in fact I think I will be going back tomorrow for lunch!  First off, the woman taking orders was sooo friendly and helpful and it was obvious she enjoyed working there.  While i was waiting for my order She told me about the owners and then talked about their most popular dishes and even brought me a sample of their pork green chili.  Holy crap, that was frickin amazing!  Spicy (which I loved) but seriously great flavor!  I want it so badly now!  Sooo friendly and sweet so huge kudos to her!  Ok now on to the important part... the food!  Yummy!  Homemade tortillas were very obvious since they tasted amazing and super fresh!  The chips were freaking fantastic and were thick but light and crispy. .. again they were obviously homemade.  My carne asada burrito was good but could use some grilled veggies... my bad but I will ask for them next time.  Without a doubt I will be trying their pork with green chili next time since the sample is still dancing in my taste buds.  Ohh guac was superb too... nothing fancy or over the top like some places attempt to do.    Great prices too!!!"}
{"text":"So good!  Not greasy and I could not finish the green chili burrito, carnitas were crispy yumzilla!  Salsa had great flavor and chips were fresh and crispy.  Will definitely go back.  Oh and horchata was refreshing"}
{"text":"The food is so good and I ate it so fast/so much of it I nearly threw up at the table. We have been in the Phoenix area for over a year and this is one of the very very few actually good Mexican food places we found. Simple. Authentic. Delicious. Will definitely be on our frequents list."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in town for burritos, tacos, and nachos.  We had the carne asada nachos, shredded beef enchiladas, and tried all of the different tacos.  The margaritas were outstanding, the food was great, and the service was great."}
{"text":"This has been one of the best Green Chile Burritos I've had outside of my moms home. The service was fast and the quality was amazing. Definitely going to make this my new burrito spot."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix from Kansas City on business and drove a little out of the way to try their burritos. We were not disappointed! I had the fish tacos and the tortillas were so fresh. Also the salsa and chips (a little dark which I love). We drank Orange Fanta and Mexican Coke out of the bottle. The place was clean and bright and the staff very friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"No fuss menu yet still so hard to decide. Went with the grilled chicken burrito. Chicken was delish. Tortilla was soft and fresh.  Service was personal.  Breakfast burritos are next to taste!"}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure why it took us so long to finally try Phx Burrito House. I guess there's always that fear of disappointment based on all of the Yelp hype. But for the most part, I feel that PBH actually lives up to expectations in the areas that actually count.  It was our first time visiting and my girlfriend and I ended up ordering way too much food. One burrito with carne asada (added beans w/side of rice), which we decided to split in half. We also ordered three tacos, including grilled chicken, pork carnitas, and pork in green chile. And what the hell? As usual, I ordered a cheese quesadilla just to cover more ground.  Realistically, we probably would have been fine with just splitting the burrito and eating the chips, which were provided to us for free since it was our first time. The overall total was far less than what I was expecting, which is always a good sign.  I actually didn't expect much from the burrito, only to be pleasantly surprised. Yes, the ingredients are all decent, but what really surprised me was the quality of the tortilla, which packed a significant amount of floury flavor. I definitely intend to return to try out one of their breakfast variations (served all day). My girlfriend was equally as impressed.  The quesadilla also surprised us. The yellow cheese, which we feared would be harsh cheddar based on how it looks, was actually very light and buttery. It worked incredibly well with the high-quality tortilla, similar to what was found on the burrito.  As for the tacos? Honestly, they're fine - but I wouldn't really recommend getting them if it's your first time. Ingredients were all decent, but in comparison to some of my favorite places, I wouldn't really say they were memorable. For return visits, we'll most likely stick to the burritos and quesadillas.  For what this place is, I think they're a great option if you're in the mood for cheap-eating at a reasonable price. I look forward to returning and trying some of their other options.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"No other burrito house will do. You've been dreaming about PHX Burrito House and just don't realize it. The food is so fresh, the service so friendly, the vibe so chill.   Get the carne asada.  Get the chips & salsa (there's also a 1/2 order) Ask for the green salsa for those tacos too. Tell errbody how great this place is."}
{"text":"SO. GOOD. So fresh. Like a edible pillow of food. I chose the burrito with all ingredients, pinto beans, and grilled chicken. Ask for lime for an extra punch of flavor. Food came out perfectly wrapped. Their in-house sauce is very complimenting with the chicken. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. Fantastic food, amazing service. You'd be crazy to pass this place up. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot to grab an amazing burrito and a nice margarita - chips not included. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The Shrimp Quesadilla is my favorite. Always nice, friendly staff that greets me when I stop in."}
{"text":"Alright forget los betos , forget chipotle, forget most of the burrito shops which are step above fast food. Phx burrito is the place to go for a great burrito the house special is on point, but my favorite the chicken burrito just makes the mouth water. So the burritos come with rice , your choice of beans , your choice of meat , along with the other usual stuff sour cream and so on but they do not skip on anything . This is the spot to go. Also a big thing I love about the place are the people that work there, funny folk which remember your name, now that might be that I have been there to much which in that case I may have an addiction but trust me give it a try."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best burritos that I have had in a long time.  We had the carne asada burrito and a cheese quesadilla and it was perfection!  I can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"EVERYTIME I eat here, the lady at the counter is so personable and truly a delight to talk to. She pays every customer individual, unrushed attention, but not just towards the order, towards the guest as well! Not to mention, the food here is TOP NOTCH. I wouldn't eat a burrito anywhere else in the downtown area. The tortillas are fresh and flavorful, the burrito fillings are scratch made and delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for the best burrito in the city."}
{"text":"The BEST burrito place in Phoenix hands down! The service there is amazing and the Burritos are perfection! Try the Shrimp Burrito... EPIC! The prices are great for the amount of food you get. The Lemonade is home made and one of the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"In with friends, I opted for the Carnitas Burro which I'll just say was very tasty, reminded me of burros from East Los. Only complaint was the wait, but they comped extra chips and salsa. Great Food, friendly service reasonable prices. If your in the area give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and bright and each time I have been the staff have been more than welcoming. They engage in conversation with you and genuinely seem happy that you came.  I've been three times now, and had different items each time. Everything is great! The fish tacos, the shrimp burrito, the steak tacos, the breakfast tacos, everything! The tortillas had a great texture and flavour. Loved the cartinas!  You should go check it out!"}
{"text":"This may be a good place for the neighbors, but I do not see what was so great.  Tortilla and chips were average.  Fillings slightly above.  Maybe I caught it on a bad day and should revisit, but why when so many other good Mexican places are around."}
{"text":"This place is great! I can't get over how delicious the tortillas are. Most people think of a burrito and think of all the things that go in it but the secret to a great burrito is the flour tortillas. This place nailed it. Next time you order a burrito stop and smell the great smell of their hand made flour tortillas!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid place to grab lunch.  We got burritos & chips and salsa.  The food was pretty decent.  Mine came labeled out incorrectly and as a result I ate my wifes burrito.    The location is a little shoddy, but not terrible.    Overall 3/5."}
{"text":"My favorite burrito place ever. The carne asada burritos are my favorite and their salsa is delicious"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a number of times and finally stopped in to try it and it was delicious! I ordered the shrimp burrito and a Mexican coke for about $11. The burrito was great; shrimp was cooked perfectly, not overdone, very fresh guacamole and cabbage. I was with my boyfriend and a friend and they gave us a bowl of salsa with our order but no chips... Very weird but we decided to order some chips to actually enjoy the salsa which cost another $3. Marketing tactic? Maybe, and if so, it's working. The salsa was fresh, not too spicy, and really tasty. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Really great meal. The flavors were so good together. Wanted more!  I will be back. The beans were great. The beef was perfectly seasoned.  The tortilla was fresh, hand made. Very cool dining room on a very warm day."}
{"text":"Had a red chili burrito for the 2nd time here and it was good both times I like consistency, less beans would be nice and more meat. Churros were delicious but must be ate within 10 minutes of purchase. I liked that they had good horchata and plan on heading back for happy hour and enjoy their 4 dollar margaritas"}
{"text":"Extremely nice people who operate this business, particularly \"Dan\" who runs the front of the restaurant.  Due to a slight difficulty one day, Dan offered me a free water (due to the heat) and 50% off my next burrito.  This is great customer service.  I didn't even ask or expect this level of compensation.  It simply appeared to be a natural or automatic response to a small customer inconvenience.  The interior is clean and simple, with ample room for dining.  I have been here a few times now and can safely say that I am a fan.  Their \"special\" carne asada burrito is nicely flavored and has a multitude of little, succulent pieces of properly prepared steak.  I also enjoyed the breakfast burrito, which consists of eggs, potatoes, cheese, and choice of meat.  While not the best I have ever had, they certainly keep me returning for more.  Overall, PHX Burrito House should be applauded for having outstanding customer service and their ability to make a damn good burrito."}
{"text":"I ordered a veggie burrito with refried beans, and it was nothing special. There was too much beans and not enough rice, cheese, or sour cream. The top 3/4 of the burrito was all beans and lettuce, while the rest of the ingredients were stuffed into the bottom 1/4 of the burrito. You could tell the lettuce in the burrito was actually a salad mix because there was also bits of shredded carrots with it. And a small portion of the tortilla was uncooked. Salsa was pretty good though! Will not be returning again."}
{"text":"The first step to an amazing burrito is the tortilla. This places nails that. Second, you can't go wrong with the carne asada filling or breakfast burritos (all day) if you're up for it. This is the best place for a burrito."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a delicious burrito, go no further! My husband and I are huge fans and eat here weekly.  The carne asada burrito is my go to choice. The ingredients are fresh and the tortillas are made in house. I highly recomend the salsa/chips and horchata, if you are looking for a little something extra. We always get friendly service and the building is well kept and cutely decorated."}
{"text":"Its alright, overpriced but decent burritos. I will be back but won't do a special trip."}
{"text":"Burritos so good they're worth the impending food coma you'll go into after eating them! Seriously, I'm glad I went here on a Sunday because I needed to take a long siesta after munching on these Mexican morsels.   I shared a shredded beef burrito and a green chile pork burrito. Both came out in a speedy amount of time. The server asked if we wanted salsa, I requested one each of the green and red and it came out in a generous portion in little styrofoam cups. The green chile pork was absolutely delicious! The green chile had a lot of savory spicy flavor and the pork was plentiful and tender. The beef was good as well but I really enjoyed the green chile sauce in the other burrito. The salsa was also superb. It tasted freshly made and went well with the burritos. They did seem to forget about the horchata I ordered so I had to remind them at the counter but it was brought right out to me as soon as I mentioned it. The horchata was creamy and sweet, a perfect way to cool down on a hot day.   Service was friendly and sweet. One of the ladies at the counter went to the tables making sure everything was to our satisfaction."}
{"text":"I've driven by plenty of times and decided to try it for lunch today with my mom. The place with clean and the girl who took my order was very pleasant. We ordered take out but while waiting I did see the chips they serve and they are made fresh which I thought was great. Nice to know they are not made hours prior sitting in some warmer.  I ordered the pork carnitas burrito and my mom ordered the pork green chile. I have to admit that my burrito had some over cooked chunks of pork which made it a bit dry. Not a deal breaker for me. I just had to throw some salsa on it. I took a couple of bites of my mom's pork green chile and I really liked that. The green chile wasn't overpowering and gave it just the right amount of flavor. The beans and rice they add to the burritos was good.  I would definitely go back but probably wouldn't order the carnitas again. I would love to try the shrimp burrito."}
{"text":"Best carna asada burrito! Homemade tortillas, super nice owners. Love this place. I typically go there 2-4 times a month and will go the extra few miles to eat at a local restaurant over similar chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Now this is the place to go get a burrito.   Excellent quality, great service and fast.  Love the breakfast burrito.   Made to order burritos.."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos=to die for!!!! The tortillas are homemade, thick and delicious! Salsas are very fresh. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The women was so nice to talk to , and she let us make whatever burritos we wanted. Chicken with calibasitas .... and the shrimp were yumm"}
{"text":"This is, by way far, the best breakfast burrito I've eaten. Not at all greasy. Fluffy, crepe like tortilla. Friendly staff. Accommodated my dietary restrictions. Will return again and again!!"}
{"text":"Best burrito EVER! The green chili pork is crazy good!!! My pick a couple of times a week."}
{"text":"Unremarkable and expensive. $20 for 2 fish tacos that tasted like carp and a carne asada burrito that was mostly rice and beans.  Went here for a work lunch. No one liked the food. Maybe it was an off day, but we won't be back to find out. Add in service that lost one order and I don't know how this place stays in business.  Also, this place no longer offers free chips and salsa. That's an extra $4!  Not sure how this restaurant got their high ranking???  Mexican places are a dime a dozen out here.  This one isn't worthy of its (current) rank.  Look elsewhere for much better fare."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  We just happened upon it while in the area. It's just a little hole in the wall but they have homemade tortillas and the salsa is amazing! Best shrimp burrito I've had!"}
{"text":"I rode my bike to PHX taco house on a sunny Saturday morning. It's located north of Indian school off 7th ave. I entered the establishment and noticed a pretty young Mexican girl working the counter.  I asked for a chorizo breakfast burrito, and she replied \"would you like cheese?\"  I declined. She got me a cup of water and I paid $5.96. I put the 4 pennies in the tip jar. I sat at a table and waited for my burrito. I got my burrito, which came with a fresh salsa. The man who brought me the food grabbed me a spoon and napkin too. Now to the burrito. The tortilla was nice and soft, the whole burrito was very warm. I took a bite; wow, I thought. It was delicious. I ate the whole thing in a matter of minutes. The salsa was just the right amount of spice and accompanied the burrito perfectly. Once I was done, I put my empty water cup, basket, and salsa bowl on the counter and headed toward the door. \"Thank you! Have a great day!\" Said the man and girl in unison. I got back on my bike and took off down the street toward home."}
{"text":"A simple menu, good choices, a cozy setting, fantastic customer service, and good food. Need I say more?  The order: A pork in green chile burrito, with rice, pinto beans, sour cream, and cheese and a carnitas burrito, with rice, pinto beans, cheese, and light on the sour cream.  The food: Amazing and definitely hit the spot. I loved the pork in green chile. It a good amount of meat with the perfect amount of green chile so your burrito isn't soaked and falling apart. The carnitas burrito was dry in comparison to the pork in green chile but that's not a bad thing, just a matter of what you're feeling - they were both really tasty. Tortilla was not too thick, and I really appreciate that the sour cream was well spread out, not a huge dallop in a corner of my burrito. The cheese was melted and went so well with the consistency of my pork in green chile burrito. Portion sizing, was perfect - it was extremely filling.  The service: Very friendly and on top of it. I think our order was forgotten but the cashier noticed we'd been sitting in the corner for a little too long and came out with a serving of chips and salsa, on the house, right after she went into the kitchen to check on our order. I was a little hungry but she handled the situation well and I have no complaints.  The verdict: So worth the drive, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hungover hipsters hunched hungrily.  That appears to be the Sunday-morning crowd. I'm really torn on this review, as PHX Burrito House has some huge strengths but also some significant weaknesses.  On the strengths side: the ingredients are fresh, the tortillas are delicious, the bungalow is minimalist-cute, and there is Negra Modelo. The excellence of the tortillas cannot be overstated -- the tortilla was, if anything, better than the fillings. The salsa verde was also really nice, with a mild kick to it, not just pure veggie-ness.  On the weaknesses side, those were the second most off-putting carnitas I've ever had. Half the lumps were burnt, and the other half were nothing but fat. It says something positive for the workmanship of the chef that I found this edible at all, but I wouldn't do carnitas here again. I ended up being just as relieved that the burrito runs heavily to rice, as it's quite pleasant rice. I can make better carnitas at home, but I wish my rice was anywhere near as good.  Service is incredibly sweet-natured but also very, very leisurely. Do not count on rushing in to pick up a burrito -- the people waiting for to-go orders had fallen into a sullen, slumped stupor, and the whole pace really works better if you're doing a contemplative ramble around the neighborhood, maybe with a book of modern poetry to keep you occupied as you wait."}
{"text":"Want an awesome breakfast burrito? Come here.   Everyone was really nice and the service was quick. The girl at the front assumed we were new and then offered us chips and salsa for free!  Everything tasted super fresh, baked right in the back. From the chips and salsa to our massive burritos, it certainly didn't disappoint. This place is worth coming to if you're desiring a burrito or simply some great food.  Thanks for being local & fresh!"}
{"text":"Quaint, consistent, friendly, \"homie\"... and those tortillas! The Green Chili burrito hit the spot."}
{"text":"Experienced the 2nd best breakfast burrito of my life at this place! Eggs and potatoes were cooked perfectly and the veggies had a little bit of crisp to them still....not soggy!  Red salsa=perfect."}
{"text":"The staff is nice but that's about it. For the price you pay the food does not stack up. Very bland in flavor. People told me this place blew Chipotle out of the water and I think that's a far cry. Food also takes way too long to get finished even when it isn't busy. I don't see why I would ever choose this place when I can hit up any of the several Chipotle locations and get better tasting for made quicker at an overall better price point"}
{"text":"Easy to accidentally drive past while on 7th Ave, but definitely worth stopping for.   The staff is incredibly kind and helpful, and the food is absolutely amazing. I used to get burritos at lunch, then decided to get a breakfast burrito and now there is no turning back.  Make sure you do yourself a favor and get some refried beans on your breakfast burrito, too."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa was great. I loved the burrito too. The house hot sauce made it though!"}
{"text":"They just opened up over Christmas. Carne Asada Burrito's just OK but the red, green sauce was awesome. Since this was our first time here we tried the puff pasties; pumpkin and apple. WOW! light fresh and tasty. It brought back childhood memories of the Hot Apple Pie at Mc Donald's, you know, when they used real apples. Give this place a try. Great group of workers....friendly and neighborly. Update 4/15 we are regulars and love the pork burrito with an awesome green sauce."}
{"text":"Margaritas were tasty & AWESOME--Right amount of flavor and punch!! Love that they carry Jarritos which doesn't use High Fructose Corn Syrup. CHIPS AND SALSA GOOD. QUESADILLA EXCELLENT! The burrito?--Well That is another story. I ordered the \"House Favorite\", which comes with eggs, grilled onions, potatoes, and cheese. While the cheese was melted nicely--The eggs were overcooked-- I asked for both pinto and black beans and I only received a small amount of pinto. The potatoes were soft enough but lacked flavor and were pilled in and overpowered all the other ingredients and my burrito didnt taste fresh---I am guessing they don't clean their grill regularly because it smelled like \"other\" ingredients and made my burrito taste \"un-fresh\" Overall it was one of those DRY burritos. I got through a whole saucer of salsa to make up for the dryness until I said enough is enough. I wouldnt come here for breakfast burritos but YES TO THE MARGARITAS! I honestly like Taquiera Los Yaquis WAY better!"}
{"text":"I'd give a 10 if I could. Super clean place, great food, great service, great owner and staff, fair prices, felt as if I was enjoying food at a friends home, much better than a chain restaurant...keep doing what you're doing and you'll go far...I'll be back with friends!!! J"}
{"text":"The PHX Burrito House has a small eat-in area. Sometimes it is a wait to sit at a table. The steak quesadillas are amazing and the salsa that comes with it is the perfect pairing!"}
{"text":"YES!    Very good...exactly what you expected (and needed, even if you didn't know you needed it!)  Cute little building just out of site of the street - quaint even.  Shared a shrimp burrito which was full of fresh cabbage and plump yummy shrimp...and a green chili pork burrito that was brimming with pork and beans and cheese.  The tortilla's had a  little crispy edge to them.  Delicious chips and salsa.  Topped off with a Pacifico for each of us.    Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place :-)   Yummy burritos with wonderful service. The attentive staff makes sure you are enjoying your meal."}
{"text":"I was excited to find this place in my neighborhood. The food is really good. I'm not sure if its authentic Mexican but it definitely is fresh and isn't like so many of the Mexican restaurants that throw meat and cheese in a tortilla. The staff is very friendly and we do take out a lot so they are always happy to do made to order or have specials. I love the tacos and the quesidillas delicious! Its not fast food so plan to wait about 20 minutes for your order but hey I'd rather wait doe fresh food than get it fast from under the light. Its affordable as well. Only drawback I would say is that they close kinda early and they are closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"This place used to be the Indian Fry Bread House. I'm giving it 5 stars based on their pork green chili tacos alone.  The horchata was perfect.  Shrimp and fish tacos were amazing.  Gong back ASAP!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here eating one of their veggie burritos. Holy crap. No joke, this is the best burrito I've ever had in my life. Seriously. Better than Chipotle, Taco Bell, or anywhere else I've been for a burrito. Oh my god."}
{"text":"This place is really small but nice. I went in around 12, lunch time. The girl at the counter recommended the pulled pork burrito but i got the asada burrito instead. It was good! Very rich and creamy. I loved the mexican rice and refried beans in it! Cheese and sour cream? Uh yes!!! I would call this my perfect burrito. The asada meat had great flavor but a lot of fat to it? Too much fat in the burrito ruins the experience.. But still an awesome burrito, i think ill get the pulled pork next time knowing the asada has so much fat on it."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after seeing the reviews but it disappointed and I won't be going back.   The chips were thick and stale. The salsa lacked flavor. The Guac was literally just mashed avocado  with a few pieces of cilantro. My carne asada burrito was a rice burrito. It was so overfilled with rice that I couldn't taste anything else. My coworkers fish tacos tasted of pure fried oil. So gross.   The food took FOREVER to come out. We were all done eating and one of my coworkers hadn't even received his food yet.   This place was bad all around and the food say heavy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the taco's. I had a green chili, shredded beef and carne asada. The owner brought us chips because it was our first time there. He also brought us some beef red chili to try. Delicious."}
{"text":"These burritos are so simplistic yet so amazing.  No lettuce tomato onion things like that but man are they good!  The burrito shells themselves taste so fresh and the ingredients are on point!"}
{"text":"Excellent burrito place! All of the food tasted home made and fresh. I ordered the green chile burrito and a side of chips and salsa. Everything was delicious! The outside looked a little sketchy at night, but inside everyone was friendly and welcoming. I would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"The place is super cute and the service is great. I ordered a shrimp burrito with black beans and a Horchata. My cousin ordered a chicken burrito with refried beans. They give you a small cup of their house salsa. And then we shared a churro.  The shrimp burrito was delicious and with the house salsa gave it an extra kick.  The Horchata was perfect. Creamy and sweet.  My cousin engulfed his food and the rest of mine so I am guessing he enjoyed it.  The churro was fresh and had a filling that was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food for people who like mediocre Mexican food.   This place smells so freaking good! Like, for once, I've stumbled in a place that was both hip AND authentic AND tastes great. It's small and humble, with prices on par with Chipotle, so I expect something great.   I went with a green chili (pork) burrito with black beans. I can say that while the beans & rice are good, the main attraction falls flat. It's not spicy. It's barely flavorful! what a letdown. I found myself dousing it with the green habanero sauce featured at the table.   Oh yeah, don't expect any sort of complimentary salsa bar. Salsa (and chips) will cost you a bit extra, and if you're going to shell out the $3, you might as well just drop the same amount for a better burrito + chips + salsa combo at a place like La Santisima...or even Qdoba. This is me dropping stars because of superior, accessible places in the same area at the same price point.   At the end, I washed it all down with a freshly-made horchata...but halfway through, I was dealing with coarse granules of sugar! Gross!   I'm in no hurry to come back."}
{"text":"Typical white people Mexican food bland and boring not my taste sorry...salsa sucks not spicy at all and honestly it taste liked canned tomato salsa which is wack..."}
{"text":"Great food. Very authentic and great customer service. Hard to find nowadays. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I had a shrimp burrito.  You know what I liked about it? It was simple.   No special sauce.  No fancy take on a classic.  Just some good grilled shrimp with minimal seasoning, fresh lettuce, tomato, and avocado.  Good tortilla too! I dig the crazy concoctions and re-imaginings as much as the next gal, but when simple is done right you are reminded how good it is."}
{"text":"The carne asada burrito with guac is one of the best carne asada burros I've ever had. This place is right behind where I live and I wasn't expecting much but I was wrong. It's another excuse to walk my dog;)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Absolutely love this place. I didn't realize there was seating available, next time we plan to eat there. It's a cozy environment and the owners really know how to treat there customers!"}
{"text":"Came back to home to visit from Chicago and this was an amazing burrito. The grilled chicken burrito was great."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican spot in Melrose....what a great find!  I had a happy hour margarita & shrimp burrito which were both delicious!  The filling inside the burrito had a great pico flavor and wasn't too heavy.  The three people in line behind me ordered the same thing so I knew I had ordered right!"}
{"text":"Awesome joint! I had the carnitas burrito and it did not disappoint. It had a crispy texture to it that was flavorful. I'm not sure if they're suppose to hand out chips and salsa but I had asked if they had a house salsa of some sort, mind you i only wanted the salsa but it seems like the owner brought out chips and salsa, on the house. Which i thought was a nice gesture whether it was a standard or thoughtful of him. Food was delicious.  So I decided to come back a second time to try out the shrimp burrito and honestly, it was disappointing. Felt like the ingredients lacked something that I cannot wrap my tastebuds around. It tasted good overall, ingredients were fresh but burrito itself left desiring something else. The only saving grace to that burrito was their salsa which was terrific and it added depth to the burrito.  Their food is still tremendous and I will gladly come back."}
{"text":"I really like this place! The shrimp burrito was quite good, it unexpectedly bit me back, but a few swigs of water took care of that. Other people in the party liked theirs. One remark I can recall is that the burritos were filling. The owner (or I think it was) was very accommodating to our special requests, and explained the menu to us newbies. They take great care in preparing their food and I look forward to trying them for breakfast one of these days."}
{"text":"My dad and I stopped in for breakfast this morning. We ordered two chorizo burritos and I must say this has to be some of the best I've eaten in a while. From the customer service to the food I would defiantly be back again. The women at the cash register was kind enough to bring us samples of the green and red chili. I would defiantly be back for both!"}
{"text":"Best burrito place in town. Get the house favorite! It is absolutely the best breakfast (or anytime) burrito! Also love that this little place serves beer and is family owned! Support local ya'll!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in on a whim and am glad I did!  Had the carne asada burrito with everything.  It was big and delicious!  Next time I'm in (and there will be a next time!) I'll try the tacos.  Oh and I can't forget the salsa so good and fresh with just a little spice. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Burritos awesome, tacos yummy, portions perfect...service very friendly and great hometown feel!"}
{"text":"Came here after googling Mexican food in Phoenix. I was pleasantly surprised by how simple and tasty their burritos were. The staff is very polite and genuine. I cannot stop coming back. The green chili pork is bomb and I don't even like pork!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment this place was. I didn't even finish my bland thrown together burrito. I have some pretty high standards when I comes to burritos and mexican food in general. If you are going to peddle burritos in my neighborhood you better BRING IT!"}
{"text":"Best burrito place in Phoenix in my opinion! Green chile pork is great! The one dollar churros and the horchata are also favs."}
{"text":"Went to lunch on a Sunday expecting to get a quick burrito.  Extremely disappointed.  Ordered a Carne Asada burrito with no cheese and sour cream due to an allergy.  After a long wait, the burrito arrived but not my drink.  The waitress retrieved my drink, and I took a bite out of my burrito.  To my disappointment, it had cheese in it, and I returned it to be redone.  The staff took my burrito and commenced a new one.  Without any sense of urgency, I got a new burrito and this time, it was not Carne Asada.  I requested a refund, she attempted to give me an amount less then what I paid and then asked me \"didn't you get a chorizo burrito?\"  I said no.  The staff's incompetence was too frustrating at that point, and I feared that I would say something inappropriate and departed without a refund.  This restaurant needs new wait staff that's competent and caring.  Their ratings will continue to drop to the level of their service regardless of the quality of their food."}
{"text":"It's always good anytime you come. Friendly staff and great service. It's a small brick building converted to a quaint little burrito house. If you drive to fast you'll miss it. Don't miss it or it's your loss."}
{"text":"Always looking for good Mexican fare in the area.  This place hits the spot.  Small it very clean and friendly staff.  Was going to get a carne asada burrito, but opted for the enchilada meal special.  The beef was tender, sauce was flavorful, and the rice and beans were good.  Complimentary chips for first time customers.   Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY this place is amazing. Loved the fresh salsa and chips. The tortillas were fresh, and the carnitas. OOOOOOO the carnitas!! It's heaven by the mouthful. We tried the carnitas burrito and the fish tacos. Both brilliantly delicious.   We will be coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service! Delicious shrimp burrito! Their Jamaica was amazing, but wish they had free refills :/"}
{"text":"PHX Burrito has what many others fail to achieve. Fresh ingredients and FLAVOR! Its an attractive spot and my burrito and horchata were delicious. Their homemade salsa nailed what a good salsa should do in complimenting a burrito. You should try it!"}
{"text":"This place is NOT FUCKING AROUND. Best mexican food Ive had in phoenix. Got a Carne Asada burrito with pinto beans(NOT RE-FRIED, also have black beans), the softest rices Ive ever had, monterey jack(HAVE TO ASK FOR JUST JACK if you dont want the mix), and onions/cilantro.   It was absolutely AMAZING, didnt even need to use either of the salsas. That doesnt mean I didnt though. im a huge green salsa fan so I was floored by the tomatillo sauce. Fresh, flavorful, good kick, but not overwhelming. This place was like being back in ventura california  a couple blocks from the ocean at taquiera vallarta, best mexican food I ever had... They also have bottled pepsi and coke, huge selling point for me, albeit the smaller ones at 2.50 a piece.   The only negative I could see is its on the upper echelon of cheap. It was only 10 bucks with a bottle of pepsi(cheaper with fountain drink), just not fast food cheap is all. But for the price, its worth EVERY PENNY. This isnt like some of these other burrito shop where they charge you 6.50 for a burrito with all that inside but its like the smallest thing ever. I always feel like I fucking asked to add those cause I wanted a big burrito damnit! NOT WITH THIS PLACE. I was full with like a 1/5th left and Im a big guy, like 280 big. I dont worry about my girlish figure in other words. This was more than enough for most people unless you just got done doing something extremely active(ie run a marathon).  I have no doubt everything else on the menu is good. Carne Asada is the gold standard at mexican places for me. If you can cook that, you can cook any other meat well. I was told the chile verde(pork) is even better. I bet seafood(shrimp) is as good, just not a seafood fan. They arent fucking around people, go there tomorrow, you will never be lead astray by a fat guy with 2 hands on his belly. Its the international sign language for someone with a stomach full of amazing food..."}
{"text":"Delicious thin flour tortilla. Carne asada can be more marinated. Green chili pork chunks were tender. Pretty tasty, but not overwhelming.  My friend the veggie quesadilla was better than most and lemonada was good .  Tamarino and jaimica beverage was interesting... Sweet/sour.   Staff was very friendly. Gave us complementary chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Talk about a diamond in the rough! Doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside is decorated so nicely and the food is fanatic!! The burritos are huge and the meat is so tender. Very nice employees too!  I HIGHLY recommend"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had the house breakfast burrito with cheese and no meat and it was the best breakfast burrito I have eaten in my 52 years on this planet. The salsa is freakin great and the chips cannot get any better. The servers are friendly and attentive.   PHX Burrito House is my new go to place when I'm on this side of town.  Can't wait to come back and eat here for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent service AND excellent food! We chose this place through yelp because it has such great reviews and the great reviews proved to be correct. The chicken quesadilla with Pico is so good. I would recommend this place in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"I've grown up being spoiled with burritos from Arizona and Southern California. I like my burritos big, cheap, and a little bit dirty (like the rare type of females that are into me). What Arizona is missing over places like San Diego, though, is a signature burrito. Over there, it's the California burrito. I have yet to find a good Cali burrito out here in Phoenix. However, PHX Burrito House has the next best thing. Their PHX Especial is absolutely delicious. The potatoes are high quality, great in texture, and not overbearing. The grilled onions and jalepenos are nice and crunchy. Spice is low, but they have some good salsa and hot sauce available. The eggs add great flavor without making it too breakfast-y. There's also some cheese, but not too much. The burrito itself is NOT a drippy mess; it actually feels like you are eating something somewhat healthy, as far as burritos go. Don't forget to add carne asada. I crave this thing at least once a week. This should be our Arizona burrito.  The building itself is small and very clean. The menu is short and simple. The staff that I've encountered is very friendly. There's a parking lot with enough spaces. It's divey in all the right ways for a fast Mexican food place while still being immaculately clean, friendly, not greasy, and extremely tasty.   I guess you could say I highly recommend it for their Arizona burrito alone. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love California style Mexican food and this place deliveries. Got the carne asada  burrito with the green salsa and was great. Did not have to wait long to get my food. Was lunch time on a Saturday. The only thing that I would like to see on the menu is carne asada fries and I would probably be once a week. Thanks for the great lunch."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM. I picked up a couple of breakfast burritos here last week and was very impressed. The man at the counter was very nice and the place is quaint. The decor is new age Mexican and very cozy. The food is DELICIOUS and the prices are right.   Overall, I'm happy I finally made it to PHX Burrito House. I'll most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! Very nice staff and it's clean. The only problem I have is EVERY time we go it smells like cleaning products and I'm sensitive to chemicals. The smell is so over powering and this is why... they use this!"}
{"text":"Favorite burrito spot in the world! (I'm from Detroit and have lived in several states) pork in green chile is to die for... Great service, delicious food, and reasonably priced! Did I mention happy hour and a bar?? Free chips and salsa?? Yes... You should eat here"}
{"text":"The BEST authentic burrito in this town! The service and atmosphere are by far impeccable! Highly recommend and would go back in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"Terrible food. There was about 6 of us that went and got different kinds of burritos and tacos and everything was bad. Not even the salsa was good."}
{"text":"Totally over priced.  $8.50 for a breakfast burrito? Cheapest ingredients know to Mexico!? Won't be going back again. Ever"}
{"text":"I want to start off saying that the service was very friendly and will probably get us to come back for a second chance. With that said I really wasn't impressed with PHX Burrito House. Now I tried the breakfast burrito with bacon, yeah I'm a real health nut, and was really disappointed with the quality. I did like the tortilla, but I found the eggs tasted like they had been sitting on the griddle for awhile and the bacon was so little I think it was only in one bite. Never a good sign when you have to slather the Cholula sauce all over your meal.  I have had much better around the valley and maybe it was just an off day seeing the reviews, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"Had to give PHX Burrito House a shot since there's a lot of good hype about it. Gave it a whirl yesterday and I have to say it's actually really really good. I got the carne asada burrito with guacamole. Yeah, it was bomb. Those flour tortillas were nice and chewy, just how I like em. Loved the \"Loteria\" decor as well. I'll be coming to this place more often for some burritos. Next I'll have to try the tacos!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best burritos in this part of town in my opinion. Everything tastes fresh and the owner Dan is very friendly. The food is not greasy and the meats are of good quality so it isn't a cheap gut buster like all the 'ericos in town - but still well priced and very good."}
{"text":"Entirely different experience than June's meal with my family at this restaurant.  We were the only people seated in the restaurant and it was clear the take out customers who arrived after our order was placed took priority.  I regretted adding gratuity on prior to receiving our order.   After what seemed like a long wait for a two burritos, I bit into my shrimp burrito only to taste the cabbage and hot sauce.  The shrimp were fairly well distributed further down but the guacamole was isolated to one bite somewhere around the middle. The tortilla itself was one of the best I've had but who was constructing the burritos last night?? My horchata was just meh.  Mostly ice and the guy had to be reminded to bring it all. I like the location close to our home and the fact that it is a small family restaurant.  It is clean with nice decor and a good menu but with so many other options in the area, after last night, I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just saying the EPIC burrito is where it's at. Ham, bacon, egg, cheese, potatoes, and refried beans. Try it and I promise your mind will be blown!"}
{"text":"I love the food here, and I've been multiple times. This rating is just because of the service I just had.   I'm not sure if it was really busy or not, but I just didn't feel like we were being treated the best. I told the lady I was there for a pick-up and she went back to get it, even though it was on the counter.   On the way, she dropped our bag on the floor, and picked it up to give it to us, which resulted in our burritos ripping open, which we decided to just take home because it would have taken too long to make another one and we were already over it.    Additionally, my card was charged $150 instead of $15 by another cashier who kept messing up my charge. I will be getting refunded, but it's a Sunday, so not until tomorrow hopefully (Also I am glad I had money in my account so I don't get overdrawn).   Overall, there was just not a lot of communication in the restaurant today and most of the reason we go there is for the service and today I was just not feeling it.   Love the food! But that's just half of the experience."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious food. I ordered a salad with carne asada and it was perfect. The people are so nice and the decor is cool. Clean. Altogether great dinner!  I'll come again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Not only is this one of the only Mexican restaurants open until 9pm on Taco Tuesday in the area but the food is also really really great! I highly recommend the shredded beef,the shrimp taco and the green chilli pork. The service was great and they are willing to accommodate any request regarding the food :) I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Order a chorizo breakfast burrito. The chorizo was cooked right. The tortilla tasted fresh and the salsa was fantastic. Even though they limited 2 per burrito. Service was quick, customer service was great. Go here for a great breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Delicious!! My husband got a shrimp burrito and I got the green chili burrito. Mine was phenomenal, his was good. Definitely will come back, though prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Personally I think there burritos are way better than chipotle's and friendly staff, highly recommend If your in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Friday. They certainly weren't packed but there were a lot of tables (3 out of 5 seated, 4 open) waiting for their food. I ordered a shrimp burrito to go ($8.50). It had shrimp, cabbage, pico, lemon juice, hot sauce, and avocado. I couldn't find the avocado and hardly any pico (see pic). Shrimps were good and I'm glad they threw in some additional hot sauces (and chips due to the wait) to help out the flavor on the burrito.   I'd say their issue is turning food. If they were full, you'd be waiting 20 minutes for a three minute \"Chipotle\" type burrito. Lady behind the counter was very nice. Worth the try if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Yea its not a bad burrito. For $6.99 id like a little more meat and less Beans but other than that its a pretty damn good burrito.  The green chile pork was the way to go."}
{"text":"We came in about 20 minutes before closing. The  man who helped us was kind and the food came quickly. Both of what we ordered - carne Asada burrito and shrimp tacos - were very good. We were out before closing time, but didn't feel rushed at all.   As for ambiance - The restaurant was clean and had neat decor.   In case someone needs to know -- they only use lard in their refried beans and nothing more. I don't do any pig products and I did ask - hopefully that helps someone here.   We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"WE LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food is phenomenal, I love the breakfast burritos and my husband likes the red chili beef and green chili pork. We go there all the time and have never had a bad experience with the food or the staff. Oh, and the margaritas are great there, too. So lucky to live close by!"}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast burritos and they didn't mind making one for a picky eater. Great salsa."}
{"text":"Craving tacos or burritos? Check this place out!!! I'm super picky when it comes to Mexican food. I looove tacos and I am picky about where I eat them, this place has some really good authentic Mexican tacos. I always get the some carne asada tacos, my friends the burritos! The beer selection is delicious and the horchata is DELICIOUS. Really good authentic food!"}
{"text":"Great quality ingredients, cheap prices. The veggie mix is awesome. Squash bell peppers and onions all marinated in something delicious!"}
{"text":"Eh...more like 2.5 stars.  Cinco De Mayo....needed Mexican food.  Was craving a burrito, so I decided to come down here.   Went down, parked in their lot, walked inside and was greeted by a friendly lady who told me she would be right with me.  Browsed the menu for a minute and went with a \"no filler, carne asada burrito\" and added guacamole.  Total was just over $9.00.  They handed me a little placard and I took a seat at one of the tables.  A few minutes later, they brought out my burrito.  Here is how it was.....................  Carne Asada Burrito-  The tortilla looked ok.  It was a bit skimp though.  The burrito was rolled a little bit loose.  I took a bite in and got the carne asada, guacamole and pico all at once.  Carne asada was decent.  Not good, not bad, just decent.  You could tell it was cubed up and griddled on a flat top grill.  It tasted a little bit off, actually.  Not enough seasoning maybe?  Kind of hard to describe.  I made my way down the burrito and added some of the salsa they provide.  It improved it a little bit, but I was still not that impressed.  Down near the bottom, I got some drippage action on the burrito and it was a tad greasy/oily.  Not the worst burrito I have ever had, but far from good, even.  Pretty sure I'm not coming back.  I've had way better carne asada elsewhere, and for $9.00, I wanted more.  Pictures of their pollo asado look ok, so if I do come back (not likely), I may try that out.  Meh....was expecting better based on the average 4.5 star reviews.  Still haven't found a \"good\" burrito in Phoenix :-("}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito! They had many choices to build your own burrito at reasonably cheap prices!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!! They are so nice and happy. Great customer service and fantastic food. I'm from California and I would not mind making the 6-7 hour drive 20/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Had the grilled shrimp burrito nicely done with large shrimp cooked perfectly, we also had the green chili burrito this was good it came with rice and beans inside.  The chips they serve here are fantastic with a nice salsa to go with it."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great chips & salsa, awesome carne asada & carnitas, can't wait to go back! A true diamond in the rough, clean, nice interior with very friendly staff. They even have Coke-A-Cola in a bottle!"}
{"text":"Great casual California Mexican.  Green chili pork was perfect, spicy and did I mention perfect.  The pork was delicious.  Small tender chucks with no fat in sight. The topper was the ice cold Modelo.  I'll be back to try the tacos and quesadilla."}
{"text":"Man this was a great discovery got the green chili burrito with side of rice and beans and it was all tasty and great I'll definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for quite some time.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The burrito was huge and very tasty.  The service was very prompt and everyone was very nice."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time!!! We love their carne asada  burrito!! Also very nice people and excellent customer service! A must go!"}
{"text":"Great service great food!  This was a nice little find. I had the fish tacos and they were great.  This is a small \"hole in the wall\" place, but very clean and great service.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to trying this new (ish) restaurant for awhile now... so you can imagine my excitement as we entered the cute little place that is the PHX burrito house. I wanted to try a variety of items, so the husband, my dad, and I got a quesadilla, a couple of green chili burritos, guacamole, and a red chili taco... no we didn't try the carne aside, and maybe that was a mistake. I don't really get the hype....the food just wasn't that good. The guacamole was fairly bland. The green chili wasn't spicy and the burrito was overtaken by beans and excess tortilla, dampening any flavor the green chili may have had. Additionally, it wasn't served with any salsa.... and it needed something fresh badly. The red chili taco was a bit spicier, but had an odd smokey flavor that wasn't great. Again, there was no veg on the taco... no cabbage, no peppers, no cilantro....nothing to add any freshness or brightness to the food. I'm not saying the food was bad, but it wasn't great. Maybe we went on an off day, but if this showing was representative of the food here, I can't see myself returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"From the first time my fiance had this place, he couldn't stop raving about it until we went together. I most definitely had an amazing experience. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a smile by a little older lady that made you feel at home. She made sure you understood the 'menu' and how everything was made to order specifically as you wished.  After she found out it was my first time eating their food, she offered complementary chips and salsa while we waited. We sat while people trailed in one after the other. Every person was greeted the same. \"Hi!, Hello!, How are you?, Good Morning!\" The energy was extremely vibrant.  Of course our food was amazing. The chips were thick and warm, not the cheap store-bought salty kind. The salsa wasn't too chunky or too watery for my pallet. I tried the chorizo and was not let down. Even baby in the belly liked!!! My fiance had the bacon eggs and potato burrito that was gone before I realized.   5 star all around.   I've already made a second trip & received the same warm welcome and wonderful food  A++"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and heard about this place from a co-worker.  We ordered burritos because sometimes that just sounds delicious. The first time I had a shrimp burrito and boy did they deliver. Not stingy on the shrimp, every bite had shrimp in it, I could not have been more excited.  Also when you're feeling plain they have simple bean and cheese.  Even on days where you have very specific cravings such as a breakfast chorizo burrito, they can help you out.   This place is really good but I will say they might want to step up their salsa game just a little bit.  With such good burritos you gots to have the spiciness to match.  Though that won't stop me from checking this place out once in a while."}
{"text":"Bomb diggety! Burritos are not usually my thing but I still ate half of a shrimp burrito special. And I loved the green pork quesadilla! Excellent chips and salsa too."}
{"text":"Yepp, there's really good burritos here. The tortillas they use taste so fresh and warm...  *Homer Simpson salivation*"}
{"text":"Easily the best Mexican food in Phoenix. There literally isn't a bad item on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The good is amazing, the burritos are top notch. The service is also amazing! Overall great place!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! This is one of those moments when you take a bite of food and start believing in God's existence. The food here is over the top ridiculous! It's been quite sometime since I've been completely blown away with really great food. But I guess that's what makes it all the more special. Let me start by saying that they have the most amount of parking space compared to any other taco place that I've been to so far. It sets a positive tone right from the beginning.   I asked for their most popular menu item and the cashier handed me a small cup of their green chili pork to sample. Holy Moses! This has got to be THE most amazing tasting pork I've had thus far at a taco joint. It does have a fair amount of heat so may not be for those with very low tolerance. But for the fortunate ones, this is unbelievably flavorful. The pork is perfectly cooked and the green chili sauce is to die for! It was a fairly easy choice from then on. I got a green chili pork taco and a chorizo and potato taco. Both of these were exquisite.   My friend special ordered a chorizo quesadilla. This is generally not the best way to go since chorizo is overloaded with fat as is. The cheese makes it all the more greasy. The pork fat ended up oozing and forming a pool at the bottom..   Overall, this is one of the best taco places around town! It is easily my new favorite joint for my taco fix."}
{"text":"The staff is super nice and friendly. The burritos are super yummy and they have churros for a buck! Give this place a try if your tired of chipotle or the other burrito chains. This place is definitely going into my weekly lunch rotation. I wasn't super into their chips but some people like the thicker chips, sooo give it a try! They even have a token white guy that works the counter!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so a $7 carne asada burrito should raise expectations. What, no pico or guacamole! . The other problem was there was more rice and beans than carne, and beyond that I've had much larger for less so I'll assume there are other strong points to this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! One of the best burritos I've ever had and the staff was so warm and welcoming I didn't want to leave! I will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"What a cool place! I was greeted as soon as I walked in and it felt like I was visiting a friend's house. The chalkboard paint is a nice touch and really makes the menu choices pop! I intended to get my order to go, but the place was so inviting I stayed to eat my chips and salsa.  The guys who work here are super friendly and smiled even when things got busy!  The wait time was admittedly longer than expected, but there were many people who called their orders in ahead and received their food first (rightly so).  The portions could have been just a touch bigger, but I was still very satisfied. The horchata was a little too chalky for my taste and didn't have much cinnamon, but I'm pretty picky. Hopefully next time I'll be able to take advantage of happy hour instead!  TLDR; Good prices, great food, and even better service!"}
{"text":"The owner and his daughter were so nice and welcoming! My fiancé & I made a completely random stop here during apartment hunting in the area, just to sit down for a drink & talk over our findings. We are from Indiana & were only in town for a couple days, getting ready for our big move from Indiana to Arizona. We only had drinks, chips & salsa, but I already told them we will be back once we are in town in July! Chips are very authentic tasting & I cannot wait to check out many of their other menu items. I'm big on Mexican food & I can see myself stopping in here often! This place reminded me of a coffee shop but for burritos & I thought it was so cool! The owner came around the counter, shook our hands, introduced himself, welcomed us to Arizona and told us briefly about his move to Arizona years ago! We loved the hospitality & we will be back ASAP!!! :)"}
{"text":"Skip all the other Mexican fast food joints and go here!!! I guarantee you the food is a million times better and fresher. Not only that, the staff is super nice and fast. You'll be in and out in no time for the lunch hour rush. Just stop reading and go get your burrito fix here already and thank me later!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a good spot if your in a hurry or if your just trying to hang out and eat! It's a cute authentic Mexican spot. If your also in a budget this is the place to go because it's at a good price! What more can you ask for?? Good food at a good price  i definitely recommend this place for my Mexican food lovers!"}
{"text":"DAMN YOU BURRITO HOUSE!! YOU ARE DELICIOUS AND NOW I MUST RETURN!! I found this little spot out of pure hunger and geographical location and from the outside, ok from the inside too, you really wouldn't think much of it. It's tiny inside. Not intimate. Not private. I could do lunch here. CASUAL lunch. They do have good beer selections. But just from the tacos I ordered-carnitas-I KNOW I have to go back and order again. The chips and salsa was so good it's what I ate for breakfast soooo...I will come back again and wait in a line and watch your slow outdated methods of ringing up orders just to get another taste! This was a good find for exactly what they serve. Some of the best tacos I have had anywhere. And, we are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food every single time. I love their green salsa the best.   Service is efficient so even when they are busy the wait time is not too long. I'm impressed that they know their regular customers so well and call people by name.   The parking lot is small. That is the only somewhat annoying thing sometimes."}
{"text":"This was amazing. Oddly, it was far down the list on my mobile app, but I'll be forever grateful that I ran mutt search through the full site. There a few food items I've come across in my travels that I'll chase for my life: California figs, Belgian fries and now, Phoenix burritos. Ate the house special breakfast burrito,  awesome filings but the star of the meal was undoubtedly the actual tortilla.  Wow.  Excellent value and well worth the research!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a whim... it was ok.  I ordered the steak burrito, it was pretty basic. Far from the best I've had. The tortilla was amazing. I think the fillings left a lot to be desired.   I would go back - support local shops rather than chains!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Veggie burrito for something new and was not disappointed! The flavour was excellent and the salsa/hot sauce that was provided was also nice. Have had the green chili pork and red chili beef before and those were excellent as well. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Portion size is very generous and the homemade chips are great! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The Service and  the Food. I love this place. My mom never finishes anything and she ate up lol. Must try!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem on 7th Ave between Camelback & Indian School, closer to the Indian side, west side of street. I state all the above because we had trouble finding it the first time around (at night). Fish tacos outta this world, so flavorful and fresh. The fish are my favorite.  Pork carnitas taco- perfectly cooked carnitas, seasoned & shredded just the way grandma did it. A squeeze of lime made it perfect. Carne asada tacos tasted good, seasoned right, though I'd say just a little bit dry. Again, nothing some salsa & lime couldn't fix. The grilled chicken tacos were so good, very juicy, had such great flavor with a hint of lime/ lemon. All the tacos (except fish) are accented lightly with cilantro & onion. No heavy onions which was a great relief for my onion-hating boyfriend. He was able to pick them out with ease in a matter of seconds. (actually I picked them out...). A nice selection of salsas, all freshly made. I've been here twice, will be back again. Great happy hour starting at 2:30 with bottled beers & margaritas starting at $3.  Staff is very friendly. Bonus points for great customer service!"}
{"text":"This is the best burrito I have eaten so far!  Be was the server and he was friendly and helpful!  He assured me I would not be disappointed, and he was right!  I had the Carne Asada, cheese, rice, beans, tomatoes and guacamole.  The tortilla was perfect and fresh.  For less than $8.00 you can have a great meal!"}
{"text":"The green chili burrito with rice, beans, and sour cream stuffed in a perfect tortilla was the best green chili I ever had. I can't wait to try the red chili. Excellent burritos."}
{"text":"Trying to find locally owner shops for lunch when you work odd days and hours isn't easy, with that being said, this place was an amazing find. The place is really clean and inviting. The staff was super friendly and service was good. I had the shrimp burrito and it was AMAZING. My coworkers had breakfast burritos in the middle of the afternoon and lived then. Needless to say, this place was great and is now in the rotation of regular places for lunch."}
{"text":"Bomb burritos!!! Their tortilla are delicious. The only thing I would recommend is on the green chili pork burritos add more meat. There's not enough for the burrito size."}
{"text":"Excellent burrito in a funky local spot in the Melrose district.  The beans were terrific and the burrito was very big.  The service is friendly and fast even though we went during a festival and it was packed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner, got 3 fish tacos , my mistake, I thought it came with chips and or rice and beans, well the fixings were pretty good, the fish, was minimal where's the fish!! The veggie burrito was pretty good.  2 starts for the lacking of the fish, that is what a fish taco is all about."}
{"text":"Very tasty food!! We got the Shrimp and Asada it was delicious. Good quantity and the tortillas are homemade! Will definitely be coming back when in town :)"}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch with my coworker. The burritos are amazing, had half green chile burrito and half  shrimp burrito."}
{"text":"I had the shredded beef enchiladas special, with rice and refried beans.  The enchiladas and refried beans were delicious and the rice was average.  I've also had the pork green chili and carne asada burritos with pinto beans and both were excellent."}
{"text":"Very good! I enjoyed everything. The best was the green chili pork! Carne asada burrito was good as well, just wish the salsa was a little bit more spicy"}
{"text":"No doubt the best Burrito place in Phoenix!!! I am a frequent visitor to this place and I always order chicken burrito, the chicken is grilled very well and it tastes amazing, love everything about this place, staff and service can be sometimes slow but never disappoints. Not expensive at all. Would definitely recommend this place. I always get a complimentary chips and salsa."}
