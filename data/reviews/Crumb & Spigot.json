{"text":"Amazing food - had the steak, was cooked perfect & the potato wedges that they pair with it are amazing!"}
{"text":"Ordered the wine board which was disappointing. 4 small blocks of cheese, 3 were the same, one different, none special.  The grapes sounded very interesting, soaked in vinegar and cinnamon, but to the taste, pretty awful! The vinegar was so strong and left a horrible taste. Tried to chase it with the olive crustini, additionally not good. The whole assortment does not go well together at all, seriously should be reconsidered. The olives were the saving grace."}
{"text":"This is your typical suburban strip shopping center place. Starting at the door there is a poorly trained teenage hostess who has absolutely no control over the process. It will be 20 minutes turned into 1 1/2 hour wait. A drink was nearly impossible, when we finally got the bar tender to wait on us he was rude and disinterested. Every bottle of wine we tried to order he either didn't have or said it wasn't that good. Clearly he has been trained to only sell by the glass. Then there was the pretzel app, no flavor and just mediocre. I need to stop, overall a typical mediocre suburban spot that serves the unaware patron that doesn't want to drive to far.."}
{"text":"Stopped off on my way from PA to CLE airport. Pleasantly surprised. Had the date salad and Meatball appetizer based on recommendation of the two housewives on night out celebrating 50th Bday. Great people representing Chagrin Falls!  

Whole menu looks like you can taste with friends. Pizzas looked awesome as well. 

Highly recommend making a road trip. Will be back soon on my next work visit."}
{"text":"I was very happy with the service, and main course. I loved the pastrami stromboli and dessert, though the wine plate appetizer grapes and olives were a little strong soaked in alcohol. Overall, decent experience until a member of or party was asked to leave before paying his bill. Member left as requested, and I can't really speak to what went on since I wasn't there at the time, but when I went to pay the bill in his stead, I was treated like a criminal by the apparent owner (apparent, because he said \"my\" establishment in reference to restaurant property, though I didn't ask to say for sure). Even after offering and paying with tip and any possible damage, he said \"we\" were \"disruptive for the past 45 minutes\" though no one had asked or told us this earlier. He continued on about the member of my party, and another friend,  who I actually already paid for earlier, in a very demeaning manner well after a time when it would have been relevant. Everyone else had already left. He was lucky I was impressed enough with our sever to actually pay and also add tip I felt was due. Up until that time, even with request to leave of that particular person, I was thinking I'd love to come back with my husband. It was a choice I made out of respect for our server and local establishment to pay for a coworker I had actually just met that night. Now? After feeling completely humiliated for something I was not a part of and paying above and beyond despite it out of respect for our server, I will never be returning."}
{"text":"not sure what Josie's problem is... when I was at the Crumb and Spigot last week, we were greeted on sight, and seated immediately... had a Brat burger with a fried egg cole slaw and arugula, and it was perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and absolutely delicious... I personally know one of the staff bakers, who recommended a peach tart for dessert, and that was incredible.. very good food... top flight customer service, and a bar staff that has an evil streak... a Cucumber Daquri? Yup.. the bar staff is constantly experimenting with spirits.. all in all a great place.. ,"}
{"text":"The service was miserable. Three bartenders working and a manager yet it still took 25 minutes to get a drink. When I got the drink it was very weak and the flavors don't work well. It was called the high fashion. The crunchy green salad was wimpy and didn't have the smokey blue cheese that supposedly came on it. It looks as of theirs pizzas may be good. That will be the only reason I return. Furthermore, I gave them my credit card to pay the bill and that took another 25 minutes! Maybe I'm pretentious but that is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Living in Chagrin, I don't know why it took me so long to get to Crumb & Spigot.  It's one of those places that once you go, you have such a great meal and dining experience that it ends up being your \"go to\" place.  After about 6 visits in 2 months, we've never had a bad meal and I think it may be the best pizza around.  We usually sit at the bar and have appetizers (the giant meatball is my favorite  - my BF's mom was born and raised in Italy, so you can imagine what her cooking is like, well it's one of his favorites too) and a pizza.  We have a preference for the white pizza with spinach and sausage added.  There's something about the crust that makes the pizza.  We've found the bartenders so only very nice, but very knowledgeable (especially the guy who bar tended in LA), but also generous in their drinks.  The only problem is that it is so popular, on weekends there is always a wait - and it's not that big of a place.  I'm hoping they can either expand their present space or find a larger location."}
{"text":"Third time to Cumb and Spigot. Generally food was better than average. However service was horrible.  Other patrons arrived after us that ordered, were served and left before we were served. No excuse for such a small tavern. Really wrecked the evening. Can honestly only give 3 stars"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot to go for upscale drinks and lighter fare. I would not recommend the entrees unless one really speaks to you as the price point is a little high for the execution. Stick to the starters, wood fired pizzas and pub food (sandwiches). I recommend the warm olives app, and the Spumoni Terrine was to die for. Coffee is great too at $2 for your own personal French press pot. 

Service is fair- not rude, but slightly inexperienced. I recommend coming in for your favorite adult beverages and sharing some plates. Overall a nice spot, one that you can tell is the jewel of the owners eye."}
{"text":"This was a great find. The special, cod on corn chowder with mussels, fantastic potatos and chicken rendering was amazing. As was the cauliflower tabuleh. The atmosphere is cozy and friendly with great music"}
{"text":"Best pizza around! The restaurant is small though- be prepared to sit very close to other diners. But the food is so worth it. And even though it is small and always very busy, we never have a very long wait. The spicy soprassata pizza is my favorite. And all of the salads are delicious. It is becoming a regular go-to spot for us."}
{"text":"It's wonderful to have this spot in the neighborhood now.  We had a wonderful meal there on a weeknight.  Food is creative and delicious, and the service was very good as well.  It is so much better than the other average humdrum restaurants in our little neighborhood.  My husband had one of their pizzas which have a marvelous homemade crust, and I had a really nicely done simple chicken piccata entree.  We look forward to trying out some other dishes there as well.  I'm a chef who has owned a catering business for many years, and I'm glad to have this spot here now!  Just wish that they would start to take reservations for dinner, at least on weekends."}
{"text":"Uh, reservations would be great. Maybe try permitting them. 

Obnoxious. 

Tiny space, overcrowded. Great for a cozy date with 50 of your closest strangers. 

Hard pass. I would recommend anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went for dinner a couple nights ago. Great atmosphere, the only complaint is the bar seemed very shallow and not enough room. 

The food was excellent, love the meatballs and mussels. They were top notch. The spinach pizza was a little leafy. I felt like a dinosaur eating it. It was just a pile of leaves on the pizza. 

All in all, the drinks were great, the food was good, the atmosphere was fun, very nice staff. we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. The appetizers and meal choices were amazing. There is a mixologist on hand to create anything your have in your imagination!! Wish there were more outdoor seating."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Has been our \"go to\" spot since they opened. Chef owned with a creative and inspired menu where every ingredient is of the freshest and highest quality."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what the Chagrin Valley needed. My husband and I love to stop by for an appetizer, stop for dinner or just a drink. Staff is amazing and the drinks are fantastic. Warm olives and nuts are a perfect appetizer to have while chit chatting or enjoy a pizza and salad. Desserts are amazing too. Make sure to stop by and expect to sit at the bar and wait for a table, place is small and there is always a wait. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"THE MORTADELLA PIZZA IS THE BEST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD (and ive had many pizzas, believe me.) Very well balanced drinks and a great, changing seasonal menu. Only reason they dont get 5 stars is that theyre closed on Mondays and have a very crammed seating plan, but if you're going for a downtown vibe in the burbs, I highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"I really loved this place!!  The food is so good and there were so many interesting options on the menu. My friends and I split several things and ended up ordering more and more because everything was so delicious. Our waiter could not have been more awesome and friendly!  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here before and has great meals. this recent night I met with coworkers for happy hour having a great time and was rushed by the \"head chef\". She was removing our plates quickly and saying there was a reservation and we should finish. While we spent over $100 on booze and apps. What I didn't understand is why we're were being rushed l, we are paying customers. I've never felt more under appreciated as a customer. The \"head chef\" might be good at cooking but her customer service skills are wholly lacking."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Amazing service, very friendly and super accommodating. I Highly recommend and will definitely come back. The atmosphere fun and relaxed. Great value . Enjoy!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a true gem!  Small and fabulous!  Love the decor and feel of the place and oh my the food is amazing. The bar steak may be the best thing I have ever eaten. The spaghetti squash is also great and the pulled pork sandwich is delicious. The pretzel app and warm bacon date salad are sooooo yummy.  Wonderful craft cocktails and such knowledgeable servers!  Owners are always there--their dedication shows. This place is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food, service is attentive. Kind of a hipster feel to the staff- the only real gripe is that the Grilled Chicken Salad was $19- doesn't make much sense- so it's worth a visit but it certainly isn't a bargain"}
{"text":"Love this place. The squash spaghetti squash dish with tomato based sauce is delish! This, in my opinion, is one of the best restaurants in the Cleveland area. Good food, good beer, wine and cocktail options and great service."}
{"text":"Inconsistent food quality and service sums up our two weekends in a row here.  First weekend and our first time here we had excellent service and wonderfully creative food .  The warm nuts we ordered last week were divine ! This week they were unseasoned and sub par in comparison to previous week. This week our beer sat on the counter for 10 minutes until we flagged another server to please bring it over. Our pizza order was not correct and we were given a choice of free dessert  to compensate for the long wait to remake it. However they only had s'mores or ice cream to choose from .  The cocktail we wanted instead was not covered. 4 bucks off the pizza was what they decided to do.  Service and food quality were not as we had experienced the week prior. Disappointed !"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, definitely one of the best restaurants in the area. It can be crowded and loud, but it's always festive."}
{"text":"Met up here for a Friday night date last weekend. I'd never been before and it is a little trick to find (kind of tucked in next to the wine shop). This a small, narrow venue with a few tables up front, tables on one wall and a bar with seating on the other wall. The place was packed but luckily there was a table for two available, where I was promptly seated. Reservations are probably a good idea. 

We asked for an amazing sounding entree special (seafood chowder) split as an appetizer and it was no problem. In fact the server commented that it was a great call. This rich, hearty chowder was literally the perfect way to warm up on a cold winter night. They seriously need to add this to the permanent menu, or at least keep it seasonally -- I want it again!

Next we had the Spicy Soppressata pizza. This was very good, topped with lots of fresh banana peppers and cheese, and a tasty crust. The size was ideal for two people to share along with the appetizer. No room for dessert this time!

The staff is super friendly and attentive. Drinks came quickly and replenishments were offered regularly. This place has a great energy and fantastic, interesting food. What a little gem!"}
{"text":"Because we are major pizza fans, this is another go to spot if you love a unique and thin crust pizza. The salads are also delicious and the prices reasonable
Compared to other higher end places."}
{"text":"My husband and I were hesitant at first based on the prices for drinks and also on average higher food prices than you would see in the city, but beyond that we have noticed the growing pains fade away, the food quality is great, portions are perfect and the menu has already changed a few times.  I loved the pork and beans, the pizzas are cooked phenomenally, and the service is decent.  We usually sit at the bar so it's hard to be ignored!  Happy to have a new option here in town!"}
{"text":"Waayyy overpriced!  $6 to $9 for a short draft beer?!  The cocktails were also really overpriced.  We had the soft pretzel for an appetizer.  It was actually pretty good, but $8 for one soft pretzel is too pricey.  The blue cheese bacon dip that came with it was more like cheez whiz than anything else.  The bar steak was actually appropriately priced at $20, but it was ruined by the mushroom and mustard sauce.  Maybe the chef was trying something new with this head scratching combination, but it totally failed.  Also, the steak was supposed to be accompanied by \"crispy potatoes\" which turned out to be overly seasoned fingerling potatoes that were by no means crispy.  My boyfriend had the brat burger which was extremely spicy.  His side of \"seasonal vegetables\" was actually coleslaw!  And not even good coleslaw at that!  The atmosphere was kinda cool and that's the only positive thing I can say about this restaurant.  This place is a real joke and I can't see it being open for much longer."}
{"text":"We took our 18 yo daughter there at her request to celebrate her leaving the next day for college. They refused to serve her a glass of Pro Secco, which is legal in Ohio if you're with your parents. Needed a magnifying glass to see the olives served with my Martini. Served the appetizers and then it was 10 minutes before they brought the appetizer plates. Pizza was good but the other dishes were mediocre. Flies everywhere. BurntWood tavern down the street is way better."}
{"text":"Super addition to the Chagrin Valley dining scene!  Fine food and drink with a very hip atmosphere.  Our visit focused on pizzas:.a white set off by a touch of sage, and a meatball with fab homemade meatballs...both excellent.  The place is small so go with that in mind..nice bar area for a drink/app in the late evening."}
{"text":"First dining experience on a recent Wednesday evening with a party of five. Sat us at a table of 4. They refused to pull the empty table next to us so we could be comfortable. Waitress was knowledgeable and attentive but service to get drinks and meal was slow.  Did not get a second cocktail as a result. Salads were good. Three of us had the brat burger, all rated above average in taste. Probably would try other sandwiches before I got that again. Next time there will try the wood oven pizza which looked good, pairing with a salad."}
{"text":"Gosh, was I the last person to find this place in Chagrin?  Their chef, Seth, is fantastic.  Really liked the food.  The place was hopping.  Seems like they specialize in pizzas.  Would probably like more \"meals\" on the menu.  But both of what we ordered was good.  The waitress made some good suggestions.  Great, new flavors.  Definitely home made, not bought, unthawed, and fried - so that is refreshing."}
{"text":"Very disappointed they changed the happy hour policy.  This is a very small place, and changing it to bar only seating for happy hour seems cheap and miserly. Will not go back."}
{"text":"The SE suburbs so needed a place like this! Great service, great food, phenomenal drinks... I'm just disappointed it took us this long to find it and now we're moving! The Elder Mother or Mother Elder drink is so delicious - like summer in a glass. The salads we've had have always been delicious (would love an entrée size, though, and they could be more artfully presented). Haven't had the pizza, but my friend loves it. The pretzel and cheese dip are so great. I've described it to friends as Three Palms (a compliment) with a more extensive non-pizza menu. And the drinks...oh, the drinks. Plus - I LOVE that it's kind of loud. I can bring my 5-year-old and not feel self-conscious."}
{"text":"Food is really good, service was ok. The place was just completely overcrowded. People that were standing up blocking the tiny aisle to the restrooms acted put out when asked to move. This was a weekday. I'm afraid to go during the weekend."}
{"text":"Favorite. Place. Ever. Everything i have ordered is fantastic, cocktails are amazing.  I could eat the mussels every day of my life. And the bar steak is one of my favorite dishes."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  WIsh they had more seating available.  Long wait for table.  Also very noisy.  tables extremely close together.  

Otherwise, Great"}
{"text":"Their vegan dishes were amazing. The pizza was a fantastic mix of tastes , the cauliflower steak with sauce had a deep depth of flavor, and the spaghetti squash was delicious. I wish I lived near here to eat here more. The menu was a mix of meat and vegan options, and it seems like a great place to go with friends. It was crowded when we went and very lively. Servers were friendly, and I enjoyed the entire experience."}
{"text":"Thing's have changed and for the better, the service has improved and our waiter was amazing and made the night even better. The food like always is amazing, I had a pork & beans special and by good it was the best thing I have had yet."}
{"text":"Awesome brat burger and sloppy Joe!! Their meat and cheese boards are always phenomenal as well! Owners are always very nice and they make a great cocktail! Also, must try the cauliflower steak--- excellent!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot in Bainbridge! Was visiting from Denver and ate here 2 days in a row. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant.  We started with the mussels and warm olives which were both very good.  The bar steak was one of the best steaks I have ever had.  Cooked to medium rare perfection.  Our server, Audriana, was great.  Will definitely return to try the pizza which looked amazing."}
{"text":"If possible, I would give zero stars. Neighborhood friends recommended this for a Sunday evening. We arrived around 7pm. The bar was full but aptly covered by the bartender. We were seated next to a couple whose order had been taken and the remaining customers, two or three tables, were checking out. We waited at least 15 minutes before giving up on the service. During this time, our server made three round trips past our table without once acknowledging us verbally or even making eye contact. We inquired with the hostess if we had a server assigned to our table. She apologized and said she would send him over. 5 minutes later, we gave up and left. FYI - while writing this review we were seated at the Flip Side in Chagrin Falls, had our order taken and received our first course. I should mention that our server is handling more tables than our server at the crumb place. Some places get it and others don't. Sorry but no second chances in my book."}
{"text":"We just had dinner here. Very excited to have a gluten free vegan pizza. It was delicious. We each had a crunchy salad but felt it should be double the size. The salad was delicious but too small for a starter salad that cost 8$. The fact that their gluten free pizza crust is home made was really cool. It was delicious. I don't know why it is not on the menu!!! We will come again but hope for a few more greens in the salad."}
{"text":"Rude people. Waiters/bartenders will literally gossip about you blatantly to coworkers. Extremely average over priced food. If you're looking for a place that sells cheap to make dishes for lots of money, this is your place!!!! Burntwood wannabes that come up extremely short."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Rude and not attentive. Will never come back! Food was also bland and quite undercooked."}
{"text":"My wife brought me here for my birthday. It was a Friday evening, sometime around 6pm and the place was already packed. If I had to nutshell Crumb & Spigot I'd lump it into the \"upscale New American bistro crammed into a strip mall storefront\" genre. This isn't necessarily a bad thing on its own, just an observation. It's small, overpriced, comes complete with parking lot peppered with Audis, BMWs, Mercedes and Land Rovers, and if you're shocked by seeing a can of locally-brewed beer listed on a menu for $7 you probably shouldn't bother. Just know this - it's in Chagrin Falls. Abandon any sense of what you'd consider \"reasonable\" pricing and you'll be better for it.

As I've already mentioned, the space is pretty small. Strike that. It's what realtors would call \"cozy\". They have a patio, but it's really more a postage stamp sized piece of frontage crammed with way-to-big-for-the-space tables and those god-awful barrel tables that make it impossible for you to sit comfortably without wrapping your legs around it or being forced to turn to the side for the entire length of your meal. We entered the restaurant and immediately noticed that it was already packed. Good for them, no doubt, but I knew it wasn't going to be the most enjoyable atmosphere for me.

There's a bar to the left with its 20 or so chairs and the rest of the very tiny space is crammed with seating that'll basically have you sitting on your neighbor's lap while you eat. The bench seat that stretches the length of an entire wall is just uncomfortably close. I don't like going out to a place. especially one in which I know we won't get out without dropping close to $100 for dinner and drinks, where I have to hear the entire conversation of the people next to me while I eat. It's also dimly lit and during our visit it was incredibly loud. No intimate conversations going on here, that's for sure.

Here was the first shocker. The beer list, 8 taps and 20 or so bottles/cans, is ridiculously overpriced. I don't know what planet these folks are from, but I haven't seen this sort of gouging in a long while. Here's an example - Great Lakes Brewing's Conway's Irish Ale, a decent 6.5% beer, $8. I'll give you a minute to close your mouth. A local beer, nothing special, $8?! This should be a $6 pint at the high end. OK, enough. I won't belabor the point. It's just mindblowing. Drinks for you and your date at this place could easily add $40 to your bill. 

The service we received during our visit started out quite strong. She was knowledgeable - with quite a bit of help from her notepad - friendly, and efficient. Unfortunately, as the evening progressed she became less and less present, eventually disappearing completely for nearly 20 minutes as we sat there with empty drinks and clean plates. Yes, they were busy, I get it, but c'mon. You can walk from one end of the restaurant to the other in 10 steps. But the food, that's gotta make it all worth it, right? Kinda.

The food presents Crumb & Spigot as a bistro with a bar-centric menu that has a heavy focus on pizza. The pizza oven is at the center of the open kitchen at the back of the restaurant and it takes up about half of the menu. They've got a few snack options like oysters, warm olives (ugh) and lamb chops, a selection of salads and some sandwiches and larger plates if you're looking to make a meal out of it. Just about everything on the menu reads like something delicious. Here's how our meal went.

Warm Bacon Date Salad - A very tasty offering indeed. Fresh, slightly spicy arugula and earthy baby kale, sweet dates, crunchy hazelnuts, smoky bacon and apple cider vinaigrette. While a touch on the sweet side, the mixture of textures was spot on.

The Beer Board - probably the best thing I ate here. It's a delicious, homemade soft pretzel set atop house-made beef jerky and accompanied by a halved pickled egg, spiced warm nuts and some cold cheese schmear. Simply awesome. The jerky had a touch of heat that I loved, the pretzel was warm, doughy within and crispy without, and those nuts were addicting. Get this if you come here.

The Dirty Bread Pizza - This isn't listed on their online menu, so I'm relying on memory here. A white pizza with garlic oil, bacon, Gruyere (?) cheese, sweet onions and smoked paprika. A solid pizza. The crust was delicious - slightly charred in spots, a balance of crunchy and stretchy doughy goodness in others - and the toppings very flavorful. The smoked paprika worked very well with the bacon and the nuttiness of the cheese. 

Bar Steak - The 8oz sirloin, while not all that tender of a cut, was cooked a perfect medium and topped with a ridiculously good whisky mustard and mushroom sauce. It was also not rested properly as I was greeted immediately by a plateful of blood upon my first cut. The potatoes that came with it were, I believe, Yukon golds roasted, smashed and then fried. Too bad there was only two of them. They were damn tasty."}
{"text":"Yes, this is a cool bar right at the heart of suburbia, located in a strip mall in Chagrin Falls! It doesn't look much from the outside, but the inside boast an old-fashioned elegance to the ambience. The cocktails are unique. There's a great selection of beers. Finally, their masterpiece; a burger with a patty made entirely from bratwurst.

The downside is that they do not take reservations. There's a long line to wait at peek hours.

No crumbs left at this spigot. Yum!"}
{"text":"Ththis is a nice small intimate place with great food.  The food is really good drinks are excellent and the waitstaff is very attentive.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service. It is noisy (it's a bar!). My only complaint would be the center seating area stools are incredibly uncomfortable. Just your basic wood stool. Next time we will choose a table against the wall or even sit at the bar. That being said, we are already looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Great food!  The shrimp and grits were awesome.  Everyone in our group was happy with their meals.  Only down side is very small place -- not a lot of seating and for a Tuesday night it was packed with a wait."}
{"text":"Best white pizza in town! Fresh ingredients and unusual combinations make this a winner"}
{"text":"The ahi tuna was delicious, as were the mussels. I also enjoyed the Turkey Burger! The food was delicious."}
{"text":"Good food and well presented. Only complaint is the noise level. Experienced staff makes for enjoyable dining."}
{"text":"I was not crazy about the atmosphere (nothing but high tops) but I was crazy about the food!  I was greeted with a smile and seated immediately when I walked in.  Everyone around me was eating pizza and it looked incredible!! Their drink menu looked really enticing! I ordered a salad with arugula, mixed greens and kale tossed in a Dijon dressing with walnuts.  It had just the right amount of dressing up in the course ground pepper on top was a tremendous addition.  I ordered the spaghetti squash stuffed with quinoa topped with zucchini noodles and mango.  I wanted something very clean and healthy. Being that it had maple in the name I was worried it would be too sweet but instead it had a subtle sweetness which sang to my tastebuds.  Everything about my meal was just so fresh and healthy. It is very rare that you can go to a restaurant and have zero guilty about what you ate. My date got the vegan sloppy Joe.  The vegan sloppy Joe was made with Farro, black beans, spinach, mushrooms, carrots and other items.  You can get this served over a toasted bun or over lettuce. I had a bite of my date's meal and almost wish I didn't because I want to eat the whole thing in addition to eating my entree.  The service was tremendous throughout our meal. My real only complain about this restaurant is that I wasn't able to eat everybody else's food in addition to my own."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at Crumb & Spigot.  The meatball pizza is amazing, as is the chicken Milanese.   Cozy atmosphere and attentive staff.  Ask for Reed's section.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because sometimes you are bumping into other people since it's so packed, and it can get real hot with the pizza oven.  Other than that, it's stop notch."}
{"text":"I've been here two times now and will continue to come back. Food is delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Crumb & Spigot has quickly become our go-to place for a weeknight dinner out. Love the cozy atmosphere. We always order the same thing - the mushroom pizza and a cauliflower steak. It's so good that we haven't tried anything else on the menu! I could literally drink the umami sauce that they put on the cauliflower. And if you're looking for an expertly made cocktail, look no further. These bartenders know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Slow service. Uninformed waiter who lacked skills required to manage a table of four. Kitchen couldn't accommodate basic requests for no pepper on pizza.  Food made wrong. Glass spilled. Ran out of beer flight glasses. Bee hive near outdoor dining. High seats only. The only small table is outside so expect to eat with strangers inside. The house salad is only vegan if you opt for a different dressing instead of the standard buttermilk option. Listed on \"no-wait\" app but does not honor the app. No reservations. No call ahead seating. Way to hipster like for its location. Next to the liquor store in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we won't be able to try the food.  The inexperienced hostess and incredibly rude owner are causing us to walk out the door.  The owner could not be nastier so We will take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We just had dinner here tonight and were extremely impressed. Crumb and Spiggot is well decorated, has a friendly staff and overall just a great feel. Not to mention the delicious food. We had the Nduja pizza which h was so different but somehow delicious, the Bianca pizza and the patty melt. I would have to say that the patty melt was by far the best part of the meal. It was so juicy and cheesy and had just the right amount of heat. I would for sure reccomend this place to anyone! Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Food excellent, service good, crazy busy everytime we are there , but worth it.  Vegan options are better than most.  Highly recommend this for a date night."}
{"text":"As a restaurant, this place is wonderful. High quality food presented very nicely with a clearly well trained chef. But this restaurant doesn't belong in Bainbridge.
When you walk in, there is a pub-vibe with loud music, high top tables, and a drink menu that is larger than the food menu. There is also a large community table in the middle of the restaurant which is trendy and fun, but terrible for families with small children which is what Bainbridge mostly consists of. I actually watched one family leave after they couldn't keep their toddler seated at a bar stool for more than 2 minutes, which I don't blame them for.
Crumb and Spigot would be a cool place for working professionals to unwind after a long week or for out of towners to wander to to find a \"cool local spot\" before drunkenly stumbling back to their hotel. But sadly, there are very few professional buildings near Bainbridge, and there definitely aren't any hotels, so this place just doesn't fit in.
It is a cool and different place for adults, the menu was very diverse and I enjoyed everything I ate, but it is also expensive for the surrounding area. For 4 adults, only 2 drinking beer, our bill for dinner was $150."}
{"text":"Best cocktail I have had in a while!  It was a muttled cucumber, vodka and San peligrino number that wasn't too sweet. Small and quaint atmosphere. Warm and friendly staff. I had the Baked oysters which were really tasty. The Pizza was out of this world, too. We couldn't pass up the side of mac n cheese, too. Also very delicious. Can't wait to go back soon."}
{"text":"First, be aware this place is super tiny. Make a reservation or expect to wait. 

The pizzas were amazing. I had the soppressata which was delicious.

They also have some great craft beers on tap. I had a delicious Stout from Stone Brewing Xoxoveza. Delicious 

 Certainly an unexpected gem given the location"}
{"text":"This place has a lovely atmosphere, with food and service to match! We had a large party, including two small children, and our waitress could not have been more on her game--dropped forks were replaced in about five seconds; napkins and extra plates appeared at just the right time. 

The food was all delicious. We had a variety of pizzas and everyone was pleased, and the shrimp and grits and spaghetti squash were wonderful. And the menu has all of the gluten free options clearly marked, and they can make most of the pizzas gluten free as well (and they actually clean out the oven and use a separate surface). 

Every adult in the party agreed that we were coming back. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I think I just had the best mouthful of food I have ever had.  My vegan daughter is also amazed.  She had a spaghetti squash thing that killed it and I had an oyster special app that was literally the best single morsel of food ever.  And I am 62 years old.  I followed it with another app, an ahi tuna thing that totally did the trick .  Enhanced by Ash's great service, this place is truly one of the best restaurants in greater Cleveland."}
{"text":"Sigh. I wanted to love it, really. I did. I came for dinner with my Mother under super high expectations from hearing about all their foodie awards. 

Located within a strip small, this snug tavern has tight seating and it is LOUD. Accompanied with the 80s techno music they were playing, it was I-almost-can't-think loud. The vibe in here is very strange. Sigh.

Our server was nice, but when we asked some questions about ingredient bases on the menu, she didn't know. What if we had a food allergy? I imagine this could be a problem for those with allergies. Sigh.

Also, they don't really have sides to accompany their burger heavy menu. If you order a burger, you're just going to have to settle for the bland cole slaw. Sigh.

The pizza menu looked amazing. To our surprise, the pizza ended up being mostly bread and little toppings. And everything ends up being pretty expensive for what you're getting. Sigh.

I think if you're a local, its late, and you're dying for a late night pizza or burger, Crumb & Spigot will do the trick and you'll love it. But if you're looking for a quiet place to dine with your Mom, have a first date, or great conversation with friends, you might just end up with a review full of sighs."}
{"text":"All around great experience.

First, the server was terrific. Extremely knowledgeable of both the drink and dinner menu.

Great selection of cocktails and craft beer. My wife had a cucumber cocktail and loved it. The restaurant had a rare case of Three Floyd's Zombie Dust; it was as good as advertised.

We each ordered a salad. My wife ordered the Crunchy Greens and I ordered the Warm Bacon Date Salad. Both were really good, but if you don't like mustard the Crunchy Greens may not be for you.

For dinner I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich and she ordered the Roasted Spaghetti Squash. Sandwich was a generous portion. Meat was tender and juicy. Potato salad side was also very good. Squash was a unique dish. You need to be willing to get your hands a little dirty.  Very mild but very good. Again a generous portion.

For dessert we split ice cream carrot cake. One of the ice cream layers was pistachio. Extremely unique and good.

All-in-all a terrific experience. Only complaint was the cost, about $100 with tip. Drinks in particular are a little pricey - $7-8 for a beer and $12 for most cocktails. If your on a budget, splitting a pizza may be a great option."}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant in Cleveland. Amazing service, creative menu, and outstanding memorable food!

The owner has been on site every time (nearly 20 visits). This is how you run a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant during the summer. 
Service was not good tonight. Dessert selection smaller. Less enthused about returning. Brought another couple because it had been so good. Sorry we did."}
{"text":"This place is amazing if you have food allergies and ha vegan or vegetarian needs. The staff is all top notch, the food is always changing with the seasons. Love, love, love this food. Owners check to make sure everything is delicious. Delightful and refreshing, and a true hidden gem."}
{"text":"Absolutely original food that is amazing . The service is tops even when they were slammed this past sat. They had our every whim"}
{"text":"Guysssssssssssss! Guess what. I went here on my birthday and forgot to update my review now that I have tried their dinner! It was another Thursday night, and the atmosphere was a complete 180. We had to wait at the bar for a table! So of course to make the time go by faster we had drinks and shots. I recall my first drink being too strong, but that's not really a bad thing! So, A+ on the bar in my opinion.

Dinner was TO DIE FOR. We ate so much and I really enjoyed it all. I would say that the homemade pretzel that can on the beef board appetizer was too burnt for my liking, but that was easily overshadowed by everything else. Especially my bar steak entree. It had some sort of mushroom sauce on top and was cooked perfectly to medium rare. I wish it did come with some other side than fingerling potatoes though. A green vegetable would have been nice with such a great steak. As for my sister, I believe she had a brat burger, but I can't remember exactly (since I don't eat burgers much). But I do know her and my dad loved it. ALSO. The pizza. You gotta try the pizza! We ordered  the chorizo and mushroom pizzas and gobbled them up. Personally, I can't pass up a good piece of carbohydrate!

So overall, very few hiccups and many many delicious memories. Definitely worth the dinner splurge!"}
{"text":"A great place for a date night out or small group of adults. There are vegan items, including a pizza with cashew mozzarella and pine nut parmesan. They also do take-out."}
{"text":"What a great surprise!  A chef at Beachclub Bistro in Euclid recommended Crumb & Spigot.  Small hole-in-the wall place.  Started with the mussels appetizer.  BEST MUSSELLS EVER!!!  Ended up ordering more 'cause they were so good.  Really nice drink selection and happy hour.  Staff was rally helpful and friendly, but it is a small place that fills up fast, so my advice is to get there early  .  ORDER THE MUSSELLS AND MAKE POPEYE PROUD!!!"}
{"text":"I think the drinks are fabulous, the food is OK. Definitely not a kid friendly spot, more of a happy hour with your girlfriends."}
{"text":"I reviewed Crumb & Spigot when it first opened and four years later, it is still my favorite restaurant.  The menu changes regularly and the food is immaculately prepared and clearly homemade.  In addition, the atmosphere is warm and friendly.  We eat there a few times a month and have since they opened and have literally never had a bad meal or bad experience.  Just a great place from top to bottom."}
{"text":"Excellent addition to the area. My wife and I lived in NYC for many years and  we were a bit spoiled by the variety and quality of food. Cleveland has a great food scene, but it's not nearly as dense as on the east coast, and much less so on the cuyahoga/geauga border.  I'm so happy a restaurant with an adventurous menu has come to our hood. We had mussels which were fantastic, a Kobe beef hot dog wrapped in pretzel, and a brick oven pizza (dough was top notch) with salami, bacon onion jam, green tomato-radish salsa, jarlsberg and provolone. I read a review on urbanspoon that described this menu as \"eclectic\" and concluded that was a negative - what the what!? That's like saying, I want my food to be boring/predictable and when it isn't I get a little cranky. This was a fun place to get a drink, and a great place to have a bite. I just hope the other locals appreciate something a little outside (in a very good way) the norm.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner tonight.  This place pays attention to detail (i.e. the hostess wiped off our table AND our chairs before seating us.)  The service was great - good job LUKE - and the food and drink was delish.  I am a very critical person when it comes to restaurants and I can honestly say I have nothing to complain about.  The warm olive app was wonderful.  Make sure you ask for bread.  Mmmm.    I will be back!"}
{"text":"We have had dinner here twice with fantastic food experiences each time.

Biggest downer - no reservations accepted!  We try to go early, good luck getting a table on weekend after 615pm.

Tasty cocktails on the pricey side - yummy and unique amaretto sour.


Wood fired pizzas delicious.  Can't go wrong with any of their meat-tactic entrees.  Yes, expensive, but I think the price is worth it.

I found service to be friendly, saw other reviews had bad experiences but I have never seen this (in fact the opposite)."}
{"text":"This place is a must when downtown chagrin falls.  They don't take reservations, but have a great selection of drinks to choose from at the bar while you wait. The menu has a broad range of items including the brat burger, and an excellent pizza with whatever toppings you want. Everyone in the group we were with had a delicious meal.  Pair the good food and drinks with a great atmosphere and friendly waiters. They earned five stars for sure."}
{"text":"Everything we tasted was good. It is loud so don't go there for a romantic date.  Our kids enjoyed their vegan pizza.  I wish they accepted reservations.  
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this little unknown spot in the Chagrin Falls area.  For a different flare of food and great drinks...super good service..go here.  I was glad I did."}
{"text":"we've eaten here a number of times but today's meal gets a shout out (they've all been great, btw!) ... ashley, our terrific server who's been there a long time and knows her stuff, recommended the mortadella pizza topped with some crispy speck ... OHEMGEEEEEE ... it was amazing!  was it the pistachios?  the pistachio oil?  the mortadella and speck??  who knows!  it was awesome!!!   but i can't leave out the sopressata pizza either or the deliciously dressed crunchy green salad!!  
all that goodness along with friendly, fun service, and good pour equals a perfect friday night meal after a long week!"}
{"text":"The pizza is absolutely incredible! May be the best crust I've ever had. Fun atmosphere and good service. Very very crowded and A little hard to find but it's worth the effort!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is easily one of the top dining establishments in Cleveland. From the custom cocktails to fantastic entrees it is top notch.  I highly recommend this fine restaurant."}
{"text":"A step outside of ordinary.

Crumb & Spigot is unlike all of the other bars and taverns in the area.  It's small, it's quaint, it's vegan and gluten friendly, it has variations on standard fare, and it has a traditional beer and wine selection.

The food was almost all a variation of what you normally order.  Caesar salad? Try vegan Caesar.  Burger? Try brat burger.  Ahi tuna? Try ahi tuna with a potato salad side.  Fries? Nope, because they don't have a fryer on site.

We didn't do a \"dinner\" as much as salad and sandwich.  The salads are near the top in terms of price and small in size.  My fiancé added shrimp to the vegan Caesar.  Salad was delicious and I couldn't tell it was vegan.  I tried the brat burger and figured this was a brat opened up and stuck on a bun.  Boy, I was wrong.  They grind up all the brat meat into a patty.  Tender, spicy, and delicious.  Had to add the fried egg for a buck.

We were highly impressed with the tavern and will be back before too long."}
{"text":"When I go back to visit my parents, we're often at a loss for decent restaurants in an acceptable driving radius of their home. Almost everywhere has boring old-american country fare. Gravy, potatoes, boiled vegetables. Blah. Why bother going out?

In addition, I'm mostly vegetarian (I eat bi-valves), and my sister-in-law is celiac, so between lack of veggie options and gluten-free menus, we're always stuck for where to go.

Luckily, Crumb & Spigot finally popped up on my Yelp searches, and I knew we had to give it a try.

First, the cocktails were excellent. They have a full bar with interesting liqueurs, amaros, and a good selection of base spirits. They also have some fine craft beers on draught. I ordered a boilermaker with jalapeno ginger simple syrup that was delicious.

My father and I both had the scallop special which came with a nice medley of zucchini,  vegetables, and yellow watermelon (what?) as a side. The scallops were cooked just right, though a tad salty, and overall the dish was great and very fairly priced at about $20. My mother got the pulled pork sandwich and, though she remarked that it was very different from what she was used to (Carolina-style bbq), she seemed to quite like it as well.

I'm very excited to return here next time I'm in the area. The menu is varied enough that I don't think I'll get sick of it. The pizzas look amazing, and are the only of the high-temperature wood over style in the area.

The atmosphere is very nice - trendy, well decorated, but with communal tables and in no way feels pretentious or stuffy. I was comfortable in jeans and a t-shirt. 

Pricey? Well, its not a bargain, but few good restaurants are. It is absolutely fair for the quality and variety, and is right on par with equivalent foodie restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. You get all of the perks of being in a city with good foodhead options, without having to leave the exurbs."}
{"text":"A little crowded and noisy, but it's the buzz of conversation, not overpowering music. 

I had planned on a brat burger, based on the online menu, but the waiter lured me into the fish special, a cod that was perfect and accompanied by a varied and tasty mix of vegetables. 

It's the kind of place where you get envious looking at all the tables around you as you're waiting for your food. Oh, you think, that pizza looks great, I should have ordered that! Wait, no, that stacked pig sandwich! Is that the \"Farm and Larder\" chicken? She seems to be enjoying it ...

And then your order comes and you notice the couple who just sat down staring at you, enviously. And they're right to do so; yours is delicious, too."}
{"text":"Wow. The growing Bainbridge Chagrin restaurant scene has a very strong new entry. Just enjoyed several apps, fresh walleye, a hard to describe sloppy joe and a pizza with chopped green tomatoes among other clever toppings. French press coffee and apple upside down cake to finish. Just right table service from Sean. He gave good insight into the menu, quantities and the everything fresh and interesting concept do the restaurant. Wide selection of great beers on tap and in bottles, though we stuck with water. 

Not open for lunch (yet?), but friends say happy hour is great and we just loved the food. 

Warm and friendly interior good for date night, large table of friends, or family dining. 

Foodies will love it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Bainbridge. The drinks are fantastic. My favorite is the Elder Mother- try it, you won't be disappointed! The banana peppers on the soppressata pizza have just the right amount of kick. The pretzel appetizer with beer cheese is great. The spaghetti squash is delicious. The macaroni and cheese with bacon is to die for. This is the perfect date night or place to meet friends for dinner and drinks. It is a small space and always busy, just plan ahead!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant. We were with friends who have been raving about it for a long time. We all had something different and all the dishes were delicious. Our server was Jillian and she was attentive, friendly and a pleasure to talk to. Will definitely return to Crumb and Spigot."}
{"text":"Ermagawddddd love everything here. Drinks, yummy and get you drunk! Mussels from the appetizers are so good and I could drink their sauce! Steak is made with an amazing mushroom sauce, get it!!! Brat burger is AMAZING and I want it to be my husband. Every pizza I get is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome addition to the Bainbridge area!  We went for drinks and a light dinner.  Lots to choose from!  When you first see the menu, you know immediately that this is not your every day \"bar food\".  Everything is thoughtfully put together with interesting combinations and expertly paired tastes.  You can tell that the owners and chefs have extensive culinary experience!  We had a \"beer board\" appetizer that was awesome! We had the sloppy joe and it was great!  Desert was even better.  We left feeling so happy at finding such a gem!  We met the owners and you can tell they are meticulous in their attention to detail and quality!  They offer a lot of vegan and gluten free choices also!  We will be making this a regular stop FOR SURE!  Please check it out and support this great addition to our area!  Also, LOVE the decor!  High end but warm, casual and comfortable!"}
{"text":"Great spot for fresh food and cocktails! Vegan options are a plus and the open concept is awesome. Friendly staff and great service!"}
{"text":"We grabbed dinner here a few weeks ago and enjoyed our homemade pizza, as well as our pretzel appetizer. Wouldn't say it's my FAVORITE place to grab dinner in the area, but we'll definitely be back!"}
