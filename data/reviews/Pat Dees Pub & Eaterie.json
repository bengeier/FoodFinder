{"text":"Definitely a little neighborhood bar, with the feel that comes with it. But the burgers are made fresh and are served on really good bread, the fries are hot, and the pizza is tasty. The ribeye steak dinner is a good bargain for your money, but be warned it won't be the best steak you've ever had. The wings are large and also tasty. We didn't have bad service, but you can definitely tell there are regulars who probably can take precedence. But you can't beat the bar food for the price."}
{"text":"A local bar the usual tv and a few tables  but the real reason to go is the PIZZA it is the BEST!!"}
{"text":"Great pub food for the price. Good ingredient quality, all the way down to the sandwich pickles...no frozen food service crap here that we saw.. We had wings, club sandwich and Italian sausage sandwich and were very pleased. Portion sizes were plenty large. 

Service was good though they were not busy. Atmosphere was divey but clean and well-lit. Their breakfast menu looked good, too."}
{"text":"Pat Dees is a great place to get some delicious pizza! Ok, so it's a dive bar, but the food is excellent. We hadn't been there for a couple of years but were nearby and hungry today, so we decided to stop in. We were there at 5:00 and it was family friendly; I don't know about later. 

My husband had a shrimp po'boy with chicken tortilla soup. Both were good. Daughter had the individual pizza with a salad for 6.99 and loved the pizza! I had a small slice of it and agreed it was great! I had the Tuna Melt with fries for 4.99. The sandwich was way bigger than I expected and I brought half home. It was a good, grilled sandwich. The fries had a seasoned coating, I guess a batter. 

Service was efficient and quick. There was another family having pizza; an older couple having a huge fish fry up and plenty of after work folks having beers at the bar. It gets a little loud in there with the TVs and general talking. We'll be back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Pat Dees is a nice neighborhood bar.  I've been a regular on Wednesday evenings for a few years.  They have a variety of $1. draft beers on Wednesdays.  The pizza is AWESOME !!!  Their sandwiches and wings are great, too.  They also have nuts and chips for purchase. Very casual and comfortable place to get together with friends.  They have a decent selection of beer and other libations.  Parking is ok, but sometimes this place is packed - even later in the evening.  There is also a small patio area.  The staff are friendly and efficient.  You can't beat the prices - it's nice to be able to treat your friends to drinks and food without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I generally won't blast a place, but this was pretty bad. This is a \"townie bar\" which generally usually appeals to me. The service was polite but it was obvious I wasn't a regular so was generally ignored. (had to ask for a soda 3 times and took 10 minutes to get it.) I decided to have lunch because I had a coupon from a local business. The potato skins were generally un editable. Soggy, and seemed to be from a microwave, unpleasant rubbery cheese. The bacon cheeseburger I had wasn't bad and the fries were ok. Although it was obvious the oil in the fryer hadn't been changed in a while. Overall not a horrible place, and honestly I didn't expect much, but I did expect more. Also no pool table or darts and small."}
{"text":"I would call this a Cuyahoga Valley experience unique to itself. I was told about the place by a cyclist/skier friend who I met in the national park.

Well I finally went for breakfast today and the place blew my expectations away. You walk in... You think, locals joint for sure. Which in my opinion, is awesome. Best sausage, hash browns, eggs and coffee I've had other than at grandma's house. Best part? 2 coffees and 2 breakfasts, $15!!!  In Lakewood or Tremont this would've been $40."}
{"text":"Two good things about Pat Dees: they have good pizza and you can't mess up beer.  I got the fish platter - was supposed to come with fries and I got \"mashed potatoes\" with canned gravy. My wife got chicken breast which looked microwaved. Slow service.  I wanted the stuffed cabbage special but they were out when we went to eat at 6:30.  If you go, do yourself a favor and only order pizza and beer."}
{"text":"Good sports tv and filling bar food.  Fries were tasty too!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the area, without a question. Incredible home cooked meals. Good coffee. Was a pleasant surprise. Now we need to try it some evening!"}
{"text":"Yes, this is a local bar. Yes, regulars are there. Yes, it's worth your time to check the place out. The big surprise is the food. For bar food it really really good. By far some of the best pizza around....even rivaling Farinacci's down the road. It's a different type of pizza...so no hate on Farinacci's. Service was great and the place is clean. Lots of TVs too. It's just an all around good local bar."}
{"text":"What a great spot. Yes, it's a dive bar. But as always, what is important to us is the food. Went Sunday morning for breakfast and the place was packed. No wonder why, as everything was done very well. Had the French Texas toast that was outstanding. Their eggs were poached perfectly on their egg dishes. The hash browns were work of art. Everybody says it's hard to screw up breakfast, but it's easier than you think if you get just one thing wrong. These folks got everything perfect. Will be back"}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING!!!!  I wish everybody staying in a local hotel would come here instead of the crappy chain restaurants. The person next to me had a Reuban sandwich that was stacked and he was blow away. $6!!  I had a remarkable chicken soup and the BEST meatloaf in my life. I can't even make one that good and I've been making meatloaf for 35 years."}
{"text":"I am surprised that there is not a lot more local buzz for Pat Dees.  The food is surprisingly good.  My first visit to Pat Dees was when I needed to get some food to help the contents of my stomach from a recently completed pub run.  So I was going to like about anything placed in front of me.  A very nice French dip was a great choice.  But I made sure to go back twice after that before forming an opinion.  So after an awesome patty melt and above average pizza, here you go.  Pat Dees is above average food, great portions, and amazing price.  During happy hour, 3 22 oz., and the afore mentioned patty melt, I got out of there for less than a 10 spot (not including tip).  The only con of Pat Dees is the service is a bit slow.  All three times I had to ask for a menu.
*disclaimer: It's very good bar food."}
{"text":"No. Just no. Stopped for b-fast on a Saturday morning about 7:30.   The coffee is terrible.  The toast is burnt and I didn't like the taste of the non-burnt parts.  The overall quality and taste of the whole meal was not good.  Had eggs over medium (those were fine), bacon was chewy, cubed hash browns fine, I paid 50 cents extra for green peppers and onions and there was literally like 5 tiny onion pieces and a few more diced green pepper. 
The server behind bar looked like she didn't want to be there and I felt we were intruding. 

Will not return"}
{"text":"Small local place with a delicious menu. You can order take out or eat inside. Try the French fries with vinegar! If you need a hair cut go next door!"}
{"text":"never expected to find my self taking my family to a \"bar\" for breakfast... but I'm glad I didn't pass by. while there may be a limited menu, the choices are spot on. The bartender/server was very friendly...Claudia. never had to wait for anything.  We had Texas French toast and it was so perfect... and served hot.... never get that anywhere. My son said the potatoes were like a breakfast scalloped potatoe filled with good flavor. Coffee was always filled.  Just remember it is a bar"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this review long over due but now that I am moving back to Ohio I can not wait to come here! It is definitely a dive bar but it has some of the best food around. Chef Jeff's specials are great, very very reasonably priced and more than generous portions. From pizza to wings to sandwiches I can't get enough of this place. Service is friendly and has the hometown feel that you can't beat."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Local bar / restaurant. Food is great. Breakfast is reasonably price and delicious. We recently has the pizza and were pleasantly surprised. Generous toppings, tasty sauce, perfect crust. Have also had their burgers and they are tasty too!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best! Super cheap compared to what I pay in CA. You seriously never have a bar tab for 5 people under $40, it's like not possible. So that's one reason I will forever be in love. Another reason is the food is awesome! Specifically the Pizza! Alcohol selection is limited , but they have enough to get the job done. Great local watering hole."}
{"text":"Worst place ever.  Fish fry was bad.  Pierogies were suppose to be homemade they were not.  Waitress did not even know what kind they were. Fish was greasy and very fish smelling.  Floors were sticky and bathroom was dirty.  Need I say more.  Don't eat here."}
