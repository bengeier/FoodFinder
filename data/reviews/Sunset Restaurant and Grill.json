{"text":"Sunset Grill is delicious Lebanese style food. They are owned by family relatives that own Kabob Grill, Mediterranean Grill, and Kassabs. So good and yummy! I highly recommend stopping in and trying their food! Quaint little restaurant, food is cooked fresh!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best Lebanese restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I go out of my way to visit there a few times a week.  The kitchen is immaculate (just like my Sita's was) and the owners are friendly....obviously skilled with their family recipes....and the portions are generous and delicious.  I always get the house salad, which is crisp lettuce, tomatoes, cukes, and olives, with shredded feta cheese and a yogurt based mint and garlic dressing that is so tasteful that I have to sop every drop with pita.  Elias' (owner)mujuddrah and sleek dishes are cooked with and garnished by the thinnest and best tasting carmelized onions that I've ever eaten.  Anything that I've ever ordered there has been amazing...falafel..rice..shwarma..baked kibbee.....if it's on the menu, you can bet that you will like it.  I make most Lebanese recipes at home and this is the first place in any city that I've found where the fare tastes better than mine. That says a lot since I always thought MINE was the best.  The standards (hummus, baba, shish kabob) are also perfectly prepared and always well presented.  The route 51 location is worrisome to me as people seem to pass the restaurants on the row but find it difficult or inconvenient to stop, and many of the restaurants have a short life.  I hope that enough people stop ONCE so that they try the food there.  I'm sure that most people will make it a point to come back."}
{"text":"I thinkthe place just opened.  I thought it was good for lunch.  I had the gyro platter and hummus.  Seemed pretty reasonable for price.  I will definitely come back to try some other things on the menu.  Family owned business.  People are nice.  Portions were huge.  I want to come back to try shish kabobs."}
{"text":"A seemingly ill-fated location that once housed Amaro's Pizza, California Taco Shop, and most recently, Edgar's Authentic Mexican, has now taken on a new proprietor, one that specializes in American, Meditteranean, and Arabic foods. Last weekend, my parents and I gave them a chance to impress us, and impress us they did. 

Generous is Sunset's watchword.

Beginning our lunch was a complimentary platter of a silky, rich, golden hummus, pickled vegetables, razor-thin pita bread, kalamata olives, feta cheese, and a refreshing tabbouleh. 

A starter of oily meat-and-rice-stuffed dolmades proved to be an appetizing and hearty second course, each leafy parcel bursting with tart flavors when bitten into. 

My entree, the Shawarma Sandwich was a log of rolled pita that contained shredded sirloin marinated in garlic, olive oil, and a smattering of spices. Lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and a \"garlic sauce\" that met aioli and hummus halfway was the pungent condiment in lieu of tzatziki. A heap of flawless matchstick fries completed the dish. 

My mother offered me a taste of her Mousaka, which was filled with eggplant, ground chuck, sweet onions, zucchini, potatoes, and a bechamel sauce that was creamy, cheesy ecstasy. If there is a Greek equivalent of lasagna, this is it. 

Dad treated himself to the Fliet Mignon Shish Kabobs, and each cube sampled was a textbook example of the kind of buttery, medium-rare steak that has people making reservations 2 months in advance in posher restaurants.  

For dessert we shared some chilly, easy going, mildly cinnamon-kissed Rice Pudding, and a thick, sticky, flaky, fantastic wedge of Baklava. 

With friendly, prompt service and such appealing fare, I'm almost writing this review with a touch of sadness since this area seems to be cursed in terms of businesses taking off. l am cautiously optimistic that Sunset Grill has chased away whatever gremlins that caused the last three occupants to go belly-up. If I met a genie, and he granted my 3 wishes, one would be for the sun to never set on Sunset Restaurant and Grill.

P.S. I've been told that the family who owns Sunset Restaurant & Grille are related to the owner(s) of Kassab's in the Pittsburgh's South Side, which accounts for the similarity to and therefore high quality of Sunset's gyros and baked kibbee, two other dishes of theirs worth vouching for."}
