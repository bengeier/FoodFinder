{"text":"Sorry, but st viator bagels alone are not enough to make a good egg breakfast sandwich. The egg, rather than a whole fried egg, is more like a egg mixture, made to be able to reduce costs. The fruit in a cup is poured directly from a can..yes, a can, and its 5 dollars, the most expensive fruit can I have ever tried. The sandwiches are obviously not fresh and God knows how old the sandwiches are. I expect airport food to be expensive, thats not my complain, but you really need to work hard to screw up a St Viator egg breakfast sandwich, but these guys made it! Congratulations!"}
{"text":"I fly a lot to Montreal and in the US, and the food from this place is the best I had found ever, fresh, good and cheap. Try the ham and brie sandwich or any of their croissants, I don't remember having croissants that good apart from in Europe."}
{"text":"Ok not reviewing the food but just mentioning that this is the place to stock up on St Viateur bagels before you board the plane back to the US.
Ok they carry only the sesame types, a bag of 6 for 5 CAD but I'm glad they do provide this service.
Those St Viateur bagels are addictive: the texture is perfect and the wood burning oven really gives a distinct flavor that I have fallen in love with.
So yes I do patronize the bagel bar to buy bagels to go for my upcoming breakfasts and I hope they stay in business so I can keep doing so."}
{"text":"Food like a chew toy
But with a lot less flavor
All in a nice box!"}
{"text":"Nope.

They're the first to open on the American side so that's why there's always a line up at 5 am it's not because of their incredible bagels all tho that's the only thing good about this place.

Sandwiches are meh. Might as well bring your own because the prices are ridiculous $9 for a normal sandwich meh and it's not even worth it.

Buy bagel and cream cheese on the side it's cheaper.

The owner is nice but not his son.

Loud rap music being played.

Do not pay cash always use CARD!

Food isn't very good a lot of my friends have been here and didn't like it they were to scared to write reviews as they don't want the owner to report them."}
{"text":"This was definitely the worst breakfast sandwich I have ever eaten. The bagel was dense, underproved and over toasted. The eggs were sloppy, runny and wet. The bacon was barely there. I would have been better off going to Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"Just fine. A whole lot better than, say, anything I'll get in an airport in the States. The son and me had lox and bagel. Yummy. CAD 11.38 - airport pricing, for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty good actually! The bagel sandwiches are rather good - I got the vegetarian one and the veggies were tastily roasted, though the cheese were less so. 

I also got the yogurt. The fruit definitely tasted like it was defrosted from frozen fruit, which was disappointing. The granola also seemed to have corn flakes or something in it that was less than exciting. 

I'd say it's good enough for a quick bite, as long as you're not expecting a fresh St-Viateur Bagel. But probably don't get the yogurt!"}
{"text":"It's an ok place to grab a sandwich or bagel before a flight. My smoked meat and Swiss cheese bagel was good. Nothing extraordinary,  but got the job done for 9.2$. I may try another sandwich next time, though it's nice to have some smoked meat on your way out of Montreal"}
{"text":"Decent to-go bagel sandwich in the American terminal at the airport. Never made it to St Viateur so at least I got to try their bagels at Bagel Bar as they only use St Viateur bagels for their bagel sandwiches. The sandwiches here were definitely much more affordable than most of the sandwiches at US airports."}
{"text":"I'm a bagel expert.

Fact: St-Viateur's bagels are excellent.

Fact: Any fresh, quality bagel that wanders far from it's birthplace is subject to degradation fairly quickly (unless it's loaded with shit you really shouldn't be eating.)

Fact: toasting/heating a bagel that's far removed from its birthplace helps prolong its life and improve its taste.

So, if you order a bagel/bagel sandwich without toasting/heating, you're inviting problems.

During my early morning pre-flight check last week, I ordered an egg, ham & cheese bagel sandwich (heated/toasted) for immediate consumption and an unheated/toasted \"smoked meat\" bagel for lunch on the airplane.

Well?  I violated my own rule. The heated/toasted egg, ham & cheese bagelwich was excellent, the other was \"just okay\" due to the lack of heating/toasting.

Nonetheless, I give Bagel Bar high marks for good food in an airport.  It's an airport people...airports are notorious for expensive, crappy food.

3.75 stars for Bagel Bar!"}
{"text":"Soggy bagels, overpriced and inattentive preoccupied service are found here. Plus one for the fact they didn't skimp on the cream cheese."}
{"text":"We tried going to the real St-Viateur Bagel while in Montreal but didn't realize that they don't take credit cards and only take Canadian debit cards... which is maddening but whatever, I don't like paying my taxes either I guess... so we left empty-handed.

While hanging at the airport waiting on my flight I was excited to see that they sell St-Viateur bagels here and in bagel sandwich form! Score! I'd be able to try these infamous ovals before my flight back to San Francisco. 

Unfortunately, they served the absolute most terrible bagel and bagel sandwich combo I've ever had. 

Dry.
Flavorless. 
Mealy. 
The toppings added had to have been a joke. As if putting a plastic bow on a pile of crap would make it any more appealing.

I know it's airport food but that doesn't mean serving up that grainy garbage and calling it a bagel is forgivable."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst bagel I've ever had.

Even though I'm reviewing this a month after I grabbed a bagel to go, I still remember how horribly it was.  Tasteless.  Dry.  Shriveled up and dying.  The smoked salmon was the only thing this bagel had going for it, and that was store bought and put onto this abominable brick.

Not to mention it cost slightly more than a designer purse.

Sad that this had to be my last meal in Montreal.  I'll find something to eat in the bathroom next time."}
{"text":"Terrible bagels!  They were not fresh--dry, mealy texture, no flavor, not enough salt.  As New Yorkers, we were excited to try the famous St-Viateur bagel before leaving the city, but what a letdown.  When in Montr√©al, eat the croissants--go to NYC if you want a bagel!"}
{"text":"There are several eating options at this terminal, and since I didn't have a bagel my entire time while in Montreal, I thought why not? This was my one and only chance to get one, as I was hankering for one, and well, it was a major disappointment. 

It was about 6:30am and was half asleep, and after going through security, and perusing my food options, I noticed a plethora of breakfast bagels on display. All were on sesame seed bagels, and were either egg and cheese; egg, ham, and cheese; or salmon and cream cheese. I opted for the egg and cheese, and anxiously anticipated eating one, as I needed a bagel fix (none for about 3 weeks).  Oh, I was so disappointed, as it was heated up by microwave, and was flat, chewy and dry. No flavor on the sesame bagel; and the egg was also bland and cheese was just way too much. Prices were fair, and not too pricey (thankfully)!

As I mentioned in my quick tip, this is a very mediocre bagel, but the only place in the gate where you can get one. I'd skip and go find another place to eat in the terminal.
Only positive side was that the coffee was really strong and robust, and there are a few tables next to Bagel Bar, where you can eat (quickly) and then board your plane!"}
{"text":"* Not bad for an airport *

Airport food is rarely a treat, but when departing from Montreal and in need of one last hit of local cuisine a smoked meat St. Viateur bagel should theoretically hit the spot.  That is why I ordered it.  

They had decent smoked meat on it, but it was sliced a bit too thin and had a bit too much fat content (even for someone like me who prefers it on the fattier side).  Perhaps it was the cardinal sin of adding cheese to it that threw me off.  They also heated it up in a toaster (without asking, and I didn't notice them going to do it while I was paying) and it came out a bit burned.  Overall it was \"ok\" for an airport meal, but could have been oh so much better!  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/nYWsw2yI8xigISLiBxDudg?select=E1la3v_Y30wPt0U8q7hYhA"}
{"text":"Got a quick bite to eat here while I waited for my flight to depart. Service was excellent, and their lox bagel was good. The flavor was excellent and the size was great, but the problem was the quality of the salmon. It was a little chewier and difficult to tear apart than I would have liked, so the process of eating the sandwich was less than attractive. I would definitely recommend that you ask them to cut your sandwich in half. Mine was just a full bagel sandwich. I also had some tea with my meal and that was good as well. 

They are able to take American currency for your purchase and they do the conversion for you, but they are only able to give you change for your purchase in Canadian dollars. I was pleased that they offered this for their patrons."}
{"text":"As the previous reviewer wrote the place is not something extraordinary. The coffee is OK- but if you came to eat here you did it because you were looking for the fastest or cheapest option at the gate and guess what you found it. 
The bagels are fresh, compare to other places it is not that expensive and for 2$ you can buy some bagels to take on the flight with you. Would I come here again? I guess each time I fly, would I come here if I wasn't trapped in an airport No but that's the idea behind airport fast food and at least they have a lot of traffic so you get fresh stuff."}
{"text":"The food here is just ok. There didn't seem to be many good food options in this part of the airport so I was easily enticed by the colorful sign on the facade of this place. The bagels on display didn't look too appealing, but I opted for the lox (salmon) bagel anyway because like I mentioned, there really weren't any other better food options. They offered to toast it for me, which was nice, and I thought this helped elevate the quality of the bagel a bit by adding a bit of a crunch. The salmon was alright, but didn't taste very fresh. The lettuce was watery. The sesame bagel was probably the best part, but even that was just mediocre. Overall this is a pretty good place for the price, but I wouldn't come back unless I had no other choice."}
{"text":"If I had it fresh, it would be better.  But this was not burnt, the salad was only a little water logged, And there was plenty of schmear.  Given the horrible reviews, It seems things have improved.  The bagged bagels were def softer than the same ones I found at Pete's in Halifax.  I consider this a win:)"}
