{"text":"My friends and I gambled there 2 days.  The dealers were HILARIOUS!  They were funny, they were helpful (telling us what the \"book\" says to do), joking around and just being cool.  There was this cool guy from Nicaragua who was like a cool Spanish Bluto.  We had a funny lady from Vietnam.  She realized we were giving our friend a hard time so when he busted she jumped in and gave him a hard time too which increased her tip from the rest of us.  They also played good tunes, classic rock, 80's and just a good assortment.  We stayed at the Mandalay Bay (which was very nice and fairly priced) but did not gamble there because their dealers had 0 personality.  The dealers at Caesars are pretty hot but do not exhibit any personality which might be deliberate.

Dear Management, continue to instruct your dealers to have fun and rock it out.

P.S.  Rap and hip-hop?  Don't even think about it because in the long run you'll drive off the lion's share of your paying customer/gambler base."}

{"text":"Die besten Margheritas in Las Vegas. Man sollte die Perfect Margherita probieren. Einfach genial. Alle Speisen sind sehr schmackhaft und nicht teuer. Sehr nettes Personal. Abends geht die Post ab"}
{"text":"We went because it was convenient to the mirage. While it's an off shoot of the flamingo, the feel is a small casino. But the lack of winnings, absent wait staff and only one $5 blackjack table didn't make it worth going."}
{"text":"The only, reason I'm giving it 5 starts. Is because of the cocktail server there. My wife and I been coming to Vegas for years and years, and both of us are seven starts. Velma is an amazing cocktail waitress, and when are there, we always go to her section."}
{"text":"The best place to hang out on the strip... especially, the five o'clock somewhere bar.  The bartenders are very friendly, sunny and do fancy tricks when making their drinks.  The bar looks like a tiki bar in the middle of the Caribbean.  Very cool.  The music is a mix of oldies, Parrothead, Marley and pop.  The casino is neat looking, but on the low end of payouts.  However, the gaming tables are standard.  They could use a cashier's desk and closer bathroom, but I think that has to do with regulations and management by Flamingo.  A fun place to be."}
{"text":"Had a great time at the Margaritaville Casino inside the Flamingo, mostly due to our cocktail waitress, Melissa!  This was the most attentive and friendly cocktail service we had on the casino floor anywhere in Vegas!  Thanks much, Melissa, I hope they keep you happy there so we'll see you again next time!"}
{"text":"The \"whos to blame\" is yummy and strong! the pink cadillac margarita is also good, not as strong but has more of a sweet taste to it"}
{"text":"Five o'clock bar is the bomb!! We go once a year and have the same bartender every time. Jesse always knows us as the Texas 311ers. Always a great time!!!  Always a \"perfect\" margarita!!"}
{"text":"Cool little casino, part of the Flamingo, even tho I lost on craps."}
{"text":"Pretty sweet, I mean the vibes are tropical / Jimmy Buffet. Nice lower minimums and great fast drink service. One of the lower key places, and not fancy. Good place for craps, some slots...it's pretty small, but you can walk anywhere from there. Have fun!"}
{"text":"Ok. I'm tempted to tell y'all this place sucks and stay away at all costs. Then, it will continue as an undiscovered oasis of friendly staff, rapid free drink service, good times, and low table limits. Really. Don't come here. Please. 

All right, I can't do it. The first time we popped in here, we were stunned by a pit boss who joked around with our table, made a bet for us when we stepped away, and just was so positively and enthusiastically in to making the experience fun. The dealers were the same in terms of dancing while they dealt, joking around, rooting for the players, and just having fun!  

We didn't leave until the sun came up but, hey, it's Vegas. They don't have clocks and I don't wear a watch..."}
{"text":"If you want to have a terrible time in Las Vegas, find dimitry or \"Dima\" in Margaritaville. This rude Russian racist will be sure to ruin your Las Vegas getaway. AVOID!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! This casino is more than just gambling and drinking. The bartenders do tricks and entertain with every drink they make and the cocktail waitresses are in bikinis! The service is great and it  doesn't get any better than that! You're missing out if you dont check it out!"}
{"text":"This review is really for the Tiki Hut which is located in the Northwest corner of the Margaritaville Casino.  Great service, friendly servers and overpriced drinks.  The last part goes without saying in Vegas so you just have to expect that.  With that being said, drinks had a good pour and more alcohol than mix.

Found this little gem while walking by and surprisingly the door we went in, it wasn't too busy.  We got our drinks quickly and off we went!  

Now please don't get me wrong because I actually am a Jimmy Buffett fan.  Is it my imagination or do they only blare Margaritaville over the speakers.  Each time we walked I swear that song was playing.  With that said, I have to knock it down a star because I am still humming that song.

Would someone help him find his lost shaker of salt??"}
{"text":"I know it sounds crazy to go to Vegas when you are a one trick pony gambler and not a very fancy one at that... Keno is our game. It is low risk if you know how to play and I not too many casinos have it anymore. We were so happy to find the Flamingo had great big leather seats with high backs to kick back and play. 

They do close at 10pm though, which forced us over to Bally's to finish playing, but that was okay, we enjoyed what we could while there."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars?

Because I stayed at the Flamingo during the week, I love table games, and Margaritaville was a middle-class paradise.

There are a lot \"neater\" casinos on the strip but I would come back to stay at this place in a heartbeat. There is the regular casino part of the Flamingo and then there is a small area tucked in the back known as Margaritaville. There's one craps table and 5-6 blackjack tables with a $5 min at certain times. Because its a smaller separate part of the flamingo its less busy during the week, the dealers are super friendly and the waitresses are on top of it. I came to Vegas with the idea I wanted to explore as much as possible but I found myself constantly coming back to Margaritaville for the laid back friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's small but cozy and they have all the newer slot machines and some old favorites. The cocktail servers are prompt and friendly. The machines seemed to be a bit looser here. Almost every game I played, I won something! I had so much fun here during the Labor day weekend. I even participated in the trivia game and won a Jimmy Buffett live concert Blu-Ray! 

So much fun, love the atmosphere. They play great tunes. This will definitely be my new go-to casino!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere! It's a party on the beach all day, everyday! :)"}
{"text":"Smaller casino attached to the Margaritaville store and restaurant. Not much here you can't find anywhere else and you don't even realize you are more than likely in the Flamingo casino most of the time as they kinda blend in together. However, I like Jimmy Buffet so wanted to stop in."}
{"text":"Love this place! We went on out last trip to Vegas in May 2012. Nice open atmosphere near the table games (they leave the doors open, so you get nice fresh air.) The dealers were great, very friendly and helpful. I was still pretty new to the game of craps when we went but they had no problem showing me the game, helping me out, and joking around. Really quick drink service too. 
The 5 o'clock somewhere bar was great. They have a \"reverse happy hour\" which was really cool. We had trouble adjusting to the time zone change (we're from the east coast) so we'd wake up every morning at 4 or 5am! We'd just head down to the bar, get some $5 margaritas during happy hour, and play some craps before the table got too busy. It was great! 
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the lack of the type of table games I like. It looked like they had plenty of blackjack tables, but only 1 roulette table and 1 craps table. There were a few times when I wanted to play but couldn't because the ONE table was full. 
Still, it was a great time. We'll be back to Vegas in May 2013 for our honeymoon and plan to stay at the Flamingo so we can spend more time at the Margaritaville casino and 5 o'clock somewhere bar!  :)"}
{"text":"Nice small casino connected to the Flamingo with a great tropical atmosphere. They have quite a few slots and a few rows of table games. Drink service is usually better here than in the Flamingo, most likely due to it's smaller size. Dealers and cocktail waitresses have always been nice and very friendly. While you're there stop by the total rewards desk and get yourself a Margaritaville card, your home casino will be jealous of how cool it is! 

Oh and don't forget that on Saturday and Sunday they have a slot tournament that you can enter after earning 10 tier points. 

Photo op in front of the sign located in the casino."}
{"text":"This place is a blast!!!  Full of fun, lots of different drinks to choose from and if you are gambling, you get free drinks served by hotties in bikinis!  The music is mixed, not just Jimmy Buffet, but plenty to keep his fans happy.  They have go go dancers on the weekends and the place is hopping till 4am every night.  It's gorgeous and brand new!  FUN!"}
{"text":"Please don't be an idiot. Of course Margaritaville is hella casual- don't compare it to the higher end casinos because that's obviously not what they are going for as a concept! Craps is a good time at Margaritaville- $5 minimum during the day and the dealers are all chill."}
{"text":"Not sure why they call this the Margaritavlle Casino.  It might be part of the Magaritaville, but it just a extension of the Flamingo Casino.  In fact, the slot tickets and gaming chips are Flamingo tickets and chips.  It's kind of boring and small."}
{"text":"This is the best place to gamble in Vegas.  All of the dealers are so nice and make sure you have a great time."}
{"text":"Margarita ville casino is a fun little area between Margarita ville restaurant and the Flamingo casino. It's color, decor, and music all staying within the theme. At night they a go-go dancer in the middle of the table games. Nnice little touch, but the dancers can't dance. The dealers I found to be good to talk to; most of them are good. You'll enjoy the carribean flavor."}
{"text":"If you don't like Jimmy Buffet or anything Caribbean, stay far away from this tumor on the Flamingo. There's nothing special about the tables and there's no welcoming presence beckoning you to gamble."}
{"text":"Very entertaining! Visited during the opening weekend so one side street was cordoned off for the grand opening. Dancing, music and the world's largest margarita was created at this event. Lots of energy in the crowd and I think it truly helped that the Jimmy Buffett concert was preceding this event.

Inside the casino the gaming tables had Margaritaville motif and the dealers were really spirited and friendly. Everything seemed so colorful and festive and the Cocktail waitresses were dressed in bikinis..only in the Margaritaville casino.The fully stocked bars were large tiki bars and I enjoyed drinking landshark lagers at them. I couldn't believe some of the shots people were drinking...some beer bong style.

Fins up I'm coming back...."}
{"text":"If you know me, you know I was in heaven!  I am a parrothead and a Jimmy Buffett fanatic.

The Margaritaville Casino delivers on all the things any landshark or parrot head is looking for. Island theme, hard boat drinks and for the adventurous pirate... High stakes black jack!!!

Ok truth be told the bar is a little pricey for the bevvies but the place delivers on the lifestyle and experience that Jimmy Buffett is selling.  I recommend if you are looking for some lower limits go early in the day.  They often have lower limit tables earlier in the day.  On more than one occasion I have been playing a $5 black jack table around the time they are raising the limit.  They are very nice and let everyone at the table know they can keep playing at the lower limit for a certain amount of time.  

I've always had a great time here and strongly recommend hitting it up.  At the bar try the Bama Breeze.  It's not on all the bar menus, but they know how to make it because the restaurant next door serves them and they are soooo delicious!"}
{"text":"Played Pai Gow poker for about 4 hours here. I enjoyed the music and the cute cocktail waitresses were very prompt with our drinks. This is a nice little annex of the Flamingo. This only bummer was the LONG walk to a bathrooms in the Margaritaville restaurant or in the Flamingo."}
{"text":"The only reason why they get one star is because the stilt walker/balloon artist, was the highlight of the dinner.

Service was horrible. Complained to management, then management copped an attitude. Too much to mention here, but don't go if you want a nice evening."}
{"text":"Pretty cool and laid back place. When we were there, all the $5 tables were taken, so we asked a manager if they would open one for us, and they did. $5 blackjack and unlimited margaritas' while playing = GREAT TIME!!! Drinks were flowing and coming fast. Dealers were a lot of fun too. If you are not gambling, drinks here are strip prices. Expensive. But, if you are on vacation in Vegas, just have fun and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I think they are really letting this run down. It's a heavy hit spot because of Jimmy but poorly lit dirty carpets make the place all too drab. The gift shop could use a good cleaning too. The tables are hit or miss as some of the dealers are friendly and others hate life. Not really appealing to become a return visitor even though we continue to venture there every time we go. I can't say we will continue to make the trip up the strip just for it any more."}
{"text":"Seems to me the older the casinos the more they reek of nasty cigarette odor.  I am also finding that I am now less tolerant of the repugnant odor.  Why is that?  I was thinking about this while walking through the Flamingo Casino.  Margaritaville was in the right place at the right time because I needed a drink & much needed outside air.  I Took my overpriced Margarita to the patio, which afforded nice views up and down the strip, & soaked in a bit of the dying sun.  Then a devilish thought struck me that for a week I don't give a damn if the office burned down...."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how I ended up in the Margaritaville Casino... well, that's not true.  I was meeting a friend who likes drinking at the bar, and I was with my aunt and uncle who decided to gamble.  We ended up at a three card poker table, and had probably the best table games dealer I've seen in awhile.  He was pleasant, helpful, and funny -- everything a dealer in Vegas should be.  Usually they're just miserable at their job and are just going through the motions.  Wish I could remember his name, but it was his birthday and he didn't seem to mind working at all.  I'll have to go back and gamble here next time I'm in town.  Really a good experience."}
{"text":"I am so in love with this casino!  It was by far my favorite one. As soon as you walk in the music, lighting, and atmosphere just swallow you up and you feel so relaxed! It's not just a themed casino it goes beyond that and it actually changes your mood to walk in here. The daiquiris & margaritas were delicious (I liked the mango one!) and the dealers were the coolest that I encountered my whole trip! They taught me how to play a few table games and were more than willing to help me if I had any questions with it. They were actually the ones offering to teach me (and I know what you're thinking, but I actually ended up winning from it!).  I'm glad that I stopped in here and it is definitely my favorite place!"}
{"text":"It's offiical, I have a new favorite destination in Las Vagas!

The atmosphere at Margatiaville was different than the other casinos on the strip.  Most casinos are dimly lit with dull colors.  Margaritaville was appointed with bright colors, island style, and there is plenty of natural light coming through the doors.  Natuarlly there was lots of Jimmy Buffett music played, but there was also a nice selction of feel good music.  The dealers I encountered (I only play craps) were the friendliest I had ever met and I have been to more than a few tables in my life.

My only complaint is that it is too small.  If you are a slot player, I doesn't really matter since there is a decent selection of the newest, most popular machines on the strip.  But, if you like table games, you may be disappointed that they have but one craps and one roulette table.  There were, however, several blackjack tables, if that is your cup of tea.

I was in Las Vegas for four days, once I dsicovered the Margaritiaville Casino, I didn't play anywhere else."}
{"text":"Hide your salt shakers... Its 5' 'oclock somewhere! Jimmy Buffet adds to the Parrot Head madness with addition of a casino at the Flamingo Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Right on the edge of the Margaritaville Cafe, you can now get your margarita with a side of roulette, blackjack or poker.  The casino is full of 'island girls' in bikinis serving cocktails, bartenders pouring shots and Jimmy Buffet blasting over the speakers. You will hear the local \"Parrot Heads\" singing along to the music whilst gambling in \"One Particular Harbor\". There's \"No Passport Required\" so give it a try and have a drink at the \"5'0clock Somewhere Bar. Its a refreshing and fun addition to the Las Vegas Strip and to the Flamingo Hotel. Stop in and have a drink and play a hand.. If  you don't.. \"it's your own damn fault\"..."}
{"text":"Small place with very tight machines. The place also pumps in a scent to make it smell tropical but it ends up smelling like old lady perfume and its way 2 strong. It is connected to the Flamingo hotel and you will have much better luck sticking with the Flamingo plus they have better selection of games. Oh, and drinks take forever to get in this casino."}
{"text":"I didn't spend much time in this casino, but all I know is this: I ordered a signature margarita at 5 pm on a Sunday and it was $5. As they say, it's 5 o'clock somewhere, and at that point it was in Vegas! They also have more happy hour deals on other various drinks that run between $3 and $4. You can't beat pricing like that on the Vegas strip!"}
{"text":"Not sure how long this place has been around but just noticed it my last visit to Vegas. The dealers are great, some are boring but in general they like to have fun. The drink service is great here too, good luck keeping up with them. I just wish they made better drinks. Good place to go and spend some time gambling and having a few drinks."}
{"text":"It was a fun place to play blackjack. I would go back again."}
{"text":"This is your regular casino within the Flamingo...but it has a Margarita motif to it. They best part is the scent they pipe in this place. It smells like sun tan lotion. Who doesn't like that smell?"}
{"text":"Being a die hard Parrothead and coming to Vegas for the sole reason of staying and drinking/gambling at the Flamingo and Margaritaville, it was awesome to see the new Margaritaville Casino addition past the restaurant.  Of course, for suckers like me who's blood flows like hot Volcano Nacho lava, I was assured I was going to win at the Margaritaville Casino because of all the Margaritaville/Buffett references and memorabilia.  So, I threw down $20 on the roulette table and won about $130 and I was convinced that Jimmy Buffett is indeed a holy man.  You'd have to be a parrothead to believe that so don't ask.  But anyways, I lost it all right away again and decided to sit at the outside bar attached to the casino and drink the \"Who's To Blame\" margaritas and just watch other people gamble and walk down the strip.  Anyways, awesome little addition to Margaritaville Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Laid back, right off the strip, and the machines and drinks were winners. Staff was friendly and attentive and the music was happy and mellow.

{"text":"As you would expect, the store has a huge selection of items, the casino has lots of slots and games, the bar is always hopping.  Music is fun and loud.  You can get great photos of Jimmy's lounge chairs, in front of a huge margarita glass and many other photo opportunities.  This is always a fun stop for us.....we recommend this as a stopover."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Extremely entertaining casino! The bartenders and the dealers had great attitudes and were there to make sure you had a good time as well. Definitely recommend one of those margarita blenders. :) If you're a parrot head then definitely make a stop at the Margaritaville casino!!"}
{"text":"So, the BFF and I came to Vegas in October for the Jimmy Buffet concert and were pleasantly surprised with not only the Margaritaville Casino but also a HUGE block party celebrating the grand opening! Score! It was packed with Parrot Heads and just a ton of fun! Coming back a few months later, it was still a blast. We grabbed a seat at the bar and had a killer time chatting up with the bartender and watching him do tricks while making our drinks. Tons of drinks to choose from, laid back island vibe which is a plus in Vegas! It took us back to our vacation in the Caribbean! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is fun!

I love how they have converted and renovated this place to be a nice new casino. It's attached right next to the Flamingo and in a great spot on the strip. When I was staying at the Flamingo for a convention recently I was able to drop in a few times to check it out and play some blackjack. Ended up having a great time! Friendly dealers and bartenders. $5 and $10 blackjack tables! Low table limits! 

The whole place feels upbeat and had terrific rock music playing along with the prerequisite Jimmy Buffet tunes. When I was walking through it seemed so laid back, with a tropical decor, bright colors, cheery, chill and relaxing. Seemed everyone who worked there said hello and had a smile on their face. Had no problem getting drinks as cocktail waitresses were always coming by and they are served up by cuties in bikinis! Even the crowd gambling here seemed more happy than at other casinos.

One thing I did notice is that this casino is on the smaller side, with a nice selection of the newest slot machines to go along with the standard table games, but not that many of them. It's a great spot to drop in to have a few drinks, gamble a bit, and begin your night of carousing. They even still have the outside balcony area overlooking the strip that you can drink on and people watch and make catcalls to the sexy ladies and gents passing by. 

Even if you are a parrot head or not then definitely check this place out if in Vegas.  The Margaritaville Casino is a fun time!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere here at Margaritaville... It has the feel of a laid back, tropical, relaxing place... much like back home, except you can gamble! It's nice to walk into this casino, right from the strip and it's searing heat, have a cold beer and hit the crap tables! Then, if you aren't having any luck on the tables, you can always sit at the bar, strike up a conversation with the friendly bartenders and play your favorite video poker games! Friendly staff and you feel comfortable here, not like you're not wanted if you don't gamble. I'm coming back next trip!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't spend a lot of time here.  It was the best part of my stay at the Flamingo. Nice staff, Fun machines Good Drinks! What more could you want from a Casino? I can think of one thing. Next visit maybe I'll win some money!"}
{"text":"This is over of two casinos on the strip where I can reliably find $5 table games no matter what time of day it is. It's still a nice casino, but it's much more casual and laid back than most of the others on the strip. They play good music as well. 

The big downside is that it's a very small casino so it can get really hard to find a spot to play blackjack or craps, especially if you don't get there right after they open. It's worth waiting around though if you prefer cheap table because they aren't easy to come by, especially at night. 

I'd definitely recommend checking out this casino!"}
{"text":"The middle of the strip...do I need to say more? Well I can't say I won much money here as I normally do much better across the street. But there is tons of great eats, people to watch, and things to do."}
{"text":"I DON'T GAMBLE! Well, only when I'm at Margaritaville casino. Smoke was very low and if you go before 5 or 6 pm there's not a lot of people and since it's a small place you don't hear those bells bouncing off the walls."}
{"text":"Nickel drafts at happy hour.....   The bartender's keep up and it is a good feel for a bar...."}
{"text":"Awesome, smells like sun tan lotion. Mad fun. Dealers are great. Bartenders are nice and got great tricks."}
{"text":"Went there twice last weekend and had an absolutely amazing time. I ate at the restaurant and had a great experience, but already wrote a separate review for that experience.

I am a huge Jimmy Buffett fan/Parrot Head, and coming to Vegas for the first time, I was very excited to play at the Margaritaville Casino inside of the Flamingo. I have to say though, it was better than I expected. 

My sister, brother-in law and fiancee are not the biggest Jimmy Buffett fans by any means, and even they enjoyed their experience here. 

I am a blackjack player, but I by no means have the bankroll to play the higher minimum tables (15-25$) found at most other blackjack tables on the strip. At this casino, there was always a $5.00 minimum table, which was a great change of pace to play at my favorite venue. The blackjack is 6-5 (only bad part) but is played out of a shoe instead of a continuous shuffler. 

I played blackjack for several hours with a great crowd of players, and did not lose money here, in fact I won. The bar service was spot-on, some of the best we experienced in vegas. Waitresses came by frequently and served more drinks. At one point I was being served faster than I could drink the three beers in front of me. We had great dealers that talked to us and entertained us further while we played. 

I played at several other casinos such as the Hard Rock (also a great experience), the Aria, Mandalay Bay, Planet Hollywood, and the Bellagio to name a few. Margaritaville was my favorite experience of them all. 

I am not a HUGE fan of the rest of the Flamingo, but loved the time I spent at this casino. It was everything I hoped for and so much more. I would be willing to stay at the Flamingo during a future visit just to play more at this casino."}
{"text":"Located right next to Flamingo is this itty bitty casino. Its still a part of Flamingo, as they take Total Rewards Card and you can cash your chips and tickets at Flamingo.  You do get a special TR card from Margaritaville."}
{"text":"Gamblin with a big Margarita and great people watching on the deck."}
