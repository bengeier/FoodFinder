{"text":"This place fucking rocks!  Pool,  Foosball,  shuffle board and more.  Nice workers, good times, good music....what else do you want? Good food? Got that too. Get your butt here and see what local is all about!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night to check the place out. The Bartender Jake was very friendly and suggested the Pizza which was great. I will most certainly return."}
{"text":"Bartender Jake greets me with \"What do YOU want?\" and tells other bartender infront of me \"Whats-his-face wants a pizza.\". I'm kicking myself for tipping him $4 for a $3 beer and $4 for $11 pizza thinking he just had a bad day but after four meetings and four abrasive experiences he should have a job not interacting with humans let alone customers."}
{"text":"Good food and a fun place.  Went for lunch with some work friends and I will be back."}
{"text":"Great local bar. Lots of TVs, Golden Tee, Buck Hunter, two pool tables, Foosball. This place has a full Chinese menu as well as a typical bar menu. Good food and cold beer, can't ask for too much more than that."}
{"text":"Im a regular at the 7777 and the service and the people are the best, 5hey make you feel like family."}
{"text":"Great service everytime I'm here. Jake is the man always takes care of me, my pitchers are poured before I even sit down. This is the type of place where everyone know yours name, great local bar"}
{"text":"I'm not a bar person, but I was pleasantly surprised with 7's. It's clean, the staff is friendly and helpful, the parking lot is well lit and monitored, and the food is great. I enjoy visiting when I'm on the west side of town."}
{"text":"Jake is the best. Great pizza. Great drinks. Stories for days. Can't wait for karaoke night."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun, with the customers.  Harry on bar is killer, and a great chef.  And James rocks it on karaoke night.  good times."}
{"text":"Im a very big gambler as well as my wife,  stopped in the other night and some big goofy looking jerk named jake waitec on us. The expieriance was unpleasantly forgetable, first of all he ignored us for at least 15 minutes before finally offering us a drink. The bar was not that busy  and once he did come around we were  200 dollars down gambling without a drink because he was too busy flirting with another female customer.He slammed our drinks down on the bar as if we were bothering him.and it was the wrong order,He slammed down on the bar and it was not what we ordered.. We just  chose to drink it instead waiting another 20 minutes.  Few minutes later I visited the restroom only to come back and find Jake drooling on my wife making rude sexual gestures. This guy is the worst bartender I have ever encountered and I will never return to this bar. My wife and I are big players and we were looking for a new place to play  my wife was so offended he made her skin crawl and we will never return to this establishment again. I will tell all my friends never to go there because of this particular bartender Jake. Otherwise I thought it was a nice new place but he just ruined it I do not see how anyone would hire this a-hole . the owner of this establishment must be blind to keep this particular person working behind his bar representing his establishment. Word of mouth is the best form of advertisement that you can't buy and I will inform all my friends and family never to go to four sevensSports Bar and Grill ever. This May be a very nice place but because of JAKE I'm sure this place will lose a lot of business just as you loss possible great customers.   I wish the owners luck with the worst bartender I've ever experienced but he must be f****** blind not to see the rudeness to his customers and the offensive behavior towards women and I'm sure it was not only towards my wife. Good luck when filing bankruptcy .    Sign great gamers never to come back. I hope Jake is only in training and not a permanent employee if that is the case you shouldn't really get rid of him and I may consider returning."}
{"text":"I came into this bar to give it a try because of the good reviews, what a huge disappointment!! Jake is a complete
\"Jerk\" I asked for a Bloody Mary and he put 1/2 a bottle of Tabasco sauce in it, making it undrinkable. He made the remark that he hates making Bloody Mary's when he set the drink down hard in front of me. I ended up getting a beer instead. I was sitting toward the end of the bar and there sat some guy that was sloppy drunk and harassing people in the bar. I asked Jake why are you letting this guy still drink and being an ass? He told me that he was the owner, \"Ron.\"  I watched Jake flirt with the women that came in and make some sexual gestures toward them as he gave them free drinks and food. Jake wasn't even paying attention to the rest of the people at the bar.The women weren't even gambling, just sitting and eating and drinking for free. I'm in the restaurant business and that's is employee theft. Now everything makes sense. All of the good reviews that this bar gets, have to be fake because the staff and owner are horrible."}
{"text":"Love this bar, love the Karaoke on Thursday, Friday, Saturday nights with James and love the staff!  The waitress there, Melanie, is a great addition to the staff.  She fits right in with her witt, and banter with the customers.  The bartenders Jake and Henry are great.  The food is great too!"}
{"text":"At first glance this place seems like an awesome sports bar. Unfortunately it is not. They have pool tables, dartboards, foosball, shuffleboard, alcohol, four poker tables and I did not think it was possible to screw up all that cool, but they pull it off every week. I've been here twice, both times the same crappy service from the old ornery man behind the bar. At first the place was almost empty minus a few locals. We asked to hear the basketball game that was on one of the TVs in hopes he'd put it over the bar speakers. Instead, the bartender Jake grumbled something and turned the volume on the TV up very very little while letting the 50s music this place always has on play well over it. Our party of three made uphalf the patrons in the place at the time and it never once seemed like the bartender wanted to serve us or was even happy to be alive. Even between songs with the bar dead silent we still couldn't hear a word from the announcers on the TV. The half-dozen TVs had me thinking one way, but I guess this isn't a sports bar. The one waitress I've seen there is OK at her job, but same as the bartender never happy to be at work and brings nothing to the place. I overheard the owner of this place is a millionaire and that dumbfounds me. I assume he made his money somewhere else and a bar must be a safe investment because he sure didn't put much effort into this establishment. This is Las freaking Vegas, how hard is it to find a pretty face with a god damn smile on it that wants to pour my beer? You don't play the music you want to hear either, you ask who's in the bar or at least pay attention to your clientele and put on something appropriate, not 50s music non-stop. I asked to order food, was handed a menu, and both staff members vanished for 20 minutes not to be seen behind the bar again. I walked out and went to Del Taco. The service was so bad I'll never go back."}
{"text":"We had such a great time here celebrating my husbands birthday. The service was great. The food was great especially the Asian food. We will def be back."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego and were looking for a place to watch the Chargers playoff game. Were pleasantly surprised to find this place and even more impressed with the hospitality. Not only did Jake go out of his way to introduce himself, he was extremely welcoming. Great food, awesome atmosphere! Well definitely be back"}
{"text":"We don't drink really and hate smoky bars. The Bar may be great but the restaurant if that's what you want to call it lacks anything resembling service . The prices are reasonable for Bar-type food but the Chinese is only moderately priced if the portions are large. Service is a joke, probably the worst I have experienced in years. Service is by a cocktail waitress whose primary duties apparently are to the bar patrons as she only comes into the restaurant side ever 20 minutes or so. After we seat ourselves, we wait at least 10 minutes for her to take our drink order. 15 or 20 minutes later she returns to take our dinner order-nothing out of the ordinary-a hamburger and a ribeye steak. 40 minutes later, no food, although she did check in on us one time to explain that the reason the kitchen was so slow was that everybody in the bar was eating! By the way, there was just one other diner eating on the restaurant side. 15 minutes later she returned to say it would just be another 5 minutes. 15 minutes later our order arrived. The presentation was quite nice but the steak was almost room temperature. The burger was OK. It turns out the order was brought to the table by the cook who apparently didn't think we should have to wait for the cocktail waitress. After a leisurely dinner, the waitress returned to see if we wanted anything else, to which we replied just a take-out box (so that we could take the steak home and heat it). She did bring it right away and you would think that would signal that we were ready for the check. She never showed. We calculated the tab and left cash plus a more than generous tip. Hope your experience is better."}
{"text":"Great place , great people, this is the place to hangout. Look out for jake from state farm he will make sure you are happy."}
{"text":"A great night here at 7777. We were greeted the moment we walked in. We were seated fast and with all the questions we had eating here for the first time. I felt very sure that we were going to get a good meal. I had the Chicken Egg Foo Young and my wife had the house special burger. The Ron Berger. A full pound burger cook just the way she likes it. 
The service was great and the food was awesome.

WE WILL BE BACK!!!!"}

{"text":"Always feel at home and have a fabulous time!  It's like a family!  Fast paced and always great service. Out to make you happy. Love hanging out with Melanie and Harry. Prices are awesome and recommend this place as a lot of laughs and a great time!"}
{"text":"Special thanks to our waitress Melanie.  Went here with some friends for my birthday which also happened to be Friday night karaoke.  She was quick to welcome us and get orders in.  Everything we ordered came out correct and in a very timely fashion.  Even though the place was busy we never felt forgotten or left out.  Her interaction with the group made us feel right at home and we look forward to having her as our waitress in the future."}
{"text":"Love the older guy on grave! Always welcomes me with my regular drink, menu, and I big smile! I love feeling so welcomed in a place like this. Especially karaoke!!! It's so much fun. 
I don't mean to be a Debbie downer but this guy is the only reason I'll go there, the old swing guy that worked there wearing a tie was so rude and inappropriate, I would wait outside till shift change. So happy I can go in ANY time now!"}
{"text":"The 5 star reviews for this place have got to be fake. There is no way this is a 5 star establishment. I would give them 1.5 but not 2 - hence the actual 1 star rating. It reminds me of the \"before\" bars on Bar Rescue - a tv show that fixes horrible bars.
Starting with the only positive - a pitcher of draft beer was only $7. However, I watched the bartender gal draw it and it started out as mostly foam. She ended up pouring at least half of it out to actually get to the beer and make it a decent pitcher. This in itself says a lot about the bar maintenance and the beer delivery system. Could be dirty supply lines, could be long lines that allow the beer to get warm before it hits the spout, could be leaks allowing air in. Regardless of the reason, it screams of neglect. I would guess not profitable too.
I didn't eat, but the food I saw looked less than average. I don't think I would ever eat there just based on looks. I bet the kitchen is scary...
Decor was tacky and kinda dirty. When there are beer advertising banners hanging everywhere, it is an immediate red flag for me. Let me repeat, RED FLAGS EVERYWHERE.
I went to see a friend play a showcase set on the 7777 Tuesday night Reno's Jam Night. While they did an ok set, the sound was horrendously bad. They finished their set and then the \"jam night\" started. I didn't think it was possible but the sound got worse. The musicians had no concept of playing for the audience. It very much seemed they were playing to feed their egos and not to entertain an audience. It was poorly organized and poorly executed. I left after two songs - with about 20 minutes of dead air in between the 2 songs I heard. It was truly awful - no better than a below average garage band in a below average garage. 
All in all, it was just not comfortable or enjoyable. It was just a mess, a wreck, and a disaster! Had it not been for the fact that I went to support my friend's band, I would have turned around and walked out immediately. I certainly won't be back."}
{"text":"Owner had lights and half of TVS turned off at 7pm to save energy while there were a dozen gblers and fans in bar.  What is next...save money on liquor or food safety?not a good sign."}
{"text":"Found a hair on my Chinese food. 
Not the first time I ordered Chinese from this bar, but the bar tender confirmed she did not wear hair caps while preparing the food that day. 
They were courteous enough to not charge me for the plate of food."}
{"text":"Tony and I stopped by for a bite to eat on fight night.  My thinking was eat and flee, but we were very surprised at this down home real bar environment. As we entered we heard \"The Voice\", that of course being Jake (lol).  What a suprise, he made us feel at home right away, I was even enlisted to pull names for the drawing (yeay) anyway the food is off the chain, drinks very good and the feel of this place is just like ....hummmmmmmm  kinda like \"Cheers\" that T.V. show.  I must say that we have adopted this place as our new hang out. It takes certain personalities to make or break a place and I must say Jake you are the Best!!  We will see you again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We came on a game day, and their game day menus are incredibly cheap. Go check it out!! I didn't drink anything, had work in an hour - but the people who were drinking in our group all got their drinks promptly, said they were delicious. Good service too. I haven't ordered off the Chinese menu yet, I've got to head back and do that!! Overall an awesome place with great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The number one thing is the owners let you know they appreciate you and your business.  As a Charger fan, they embraced us to hang out on sundays for our games.  They created a great menu of well priced and VERY good food (I had a chopped STEAK burger and it was amazing)

Everyone I talked to felt at home and the owners were PERSONALLY taking care of everyone.  I'm excited to make this my home bar for all Chargers and all Football events... or any sporting events.

They have tons of TVs, a huge big screen in a separate room next to the main area...good gambling...(I hit a four of a kind while i was there - ended up down a few bucks but at least I got some play) and friendly people all around."}
{"text":"This was out first time here and it was a great time. The bartender Jake is really good and attentive. We just moved down the street so this will be our new hangout"}
{"text":"Old person central... I didn't eat here though. Just walked in and right back out a few min later. Just wasn't feeling this place."}
{"text":"Genuine Chargers bar in Las Vegas! EVERY TV is showing game and they set off a little cannon with every touchdown. Great place to see a Chargers game. The food is good. The Bloody Mary is huge. Friendly staff. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"So we've been going here for several months now and this is still my favorite hangout. We've tried quite a few items on the menu and one of our favorite items is the pizza, especially when they're made by the nighttime bartender, Harry. All I can say is fabulous!  By the way, Harry is an awesome bartender. When he comes in for his shift, he always makes a point to come say hello to everyone at the regulars' table and knows us all by name. In fact, I can just tell him that I want \"my shot\" and he knows exactly what I want. 

We've also gotten to know the rest of the staff quite well and they're great as well. Char knows just how to order my burger so that it comes out just the way I like it, and knows what to get my husband and I to drink without even asking. There are a few new staff members and they're very friendly as well. 

This is a great place to visit, especially during karaoke on Thursday through Saturday with DJ James Bellamy...you'll hear some of the finest singers in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love the 7777 Bar & Grill! The food is good, large proportions and is reasonably priced. They have TV's everywhere, pool tables, foosball, shuffle board, darts, Texas hold'em poker tables and video poker. 

Just to give you a warning as far as service. Only deal with the waitress \"Char\" If you come in between 4:00pm and midnight. She's one of the nicest in the city. The only reason 7777 gets 3 stars instead of 5 is because of that bartender \"Jake\".

I play in a social league that has been meeting at 7777 for over a year and there are members of the league that refuse to go to 7777 because of the bartender Jake's crappy attitude. Just ask him for a drink and watch him roll his eyes like you just asked a 10 year old to take out the trash. That Jake lacks common social skills but maintains employment so he must have something over on the owner."}
{"text":"Ordered the burger. Pretty good especially for the price. Didn't look like a frozen patty. Plenty of TV for sports. Looks like a Chargers bar. Not smokey but also not busy. Couple of pool tables, fooseball, darts, and shuffleboard. I would come back."}
{"text":"Nice clean location, but don't be in a hurry at lunch time....the food is good and the prices reasonable.. but the only server (bartender) means you wait to be served...slow or non existent service with nobody else in the place.

The bartender needs some help."}
{"text":"All of the bartenders here are amazing..from dayshift with Cory newly hired..know him from another bar..and sooo happy he is at the 7s to Jake and Char and Chase on swing to Harry and hmmm.. Art on graves..always an amazing time !!! The owner Ron always has a joke to tell and if he dosent...Jake does!!! The food is always amazing!!! The staff is GREAT!!! always a fun time!!! Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"One of the best off the strip bars I've been to! Their food is delicious, fresh and affordable.  My friend and I got 2 Long Island Iced Teas and let me tell you... Jake, our bartender, made them magically delicious (and effective)!!  Great customer service, great food, fun drinks, overall great experience."}
{"text":"Just when you thought finding a pleasant neighborhood bar and restaurant was hopeless......on stage is the Four Sevens.  The food is good but the real draw is JAKE!  By far the friendliest, funniest and most accommodating bartender West of the Mississippi.  Im impressed with the experience at this place and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night to chat with the owner about being our new home in Las Vegas for the Vegas Charger Bolts (former Michael's Pub Group).  After some sampling of yummy foods, we were in agreement!  We look forward to this being our new Chargers Bar!"}
{"text":"So I visited this place 2 more times after my first visit and it just went downhill each time, and everything was as I stated before except the service. 

Last time we had an amazing middle aged woman working the bar. She was beyond friendly and when we wanted to order from the Chinese menu 5 minutes before they stop that service she ran into the back to ask him if he would squeeze in a couple of orders...which he was glad to do.

The second time I went in I didn't eat just had drinks with a friend.
The bartender seemed to take issue with anything we ordered. As if we were insulting him by even ordering drinks...even though there was only one other guest in the entire bar. I decided maybe I was just imagining this hostile undertone until it got close to 10 pm and his relief showed up.
As soon as the next bartender hit the door he looks at us and says \"Hey I gotta cash you out.\"
No big deal. I've worked service for over 10 years. I understand.
So I simply ask him \"Do you need to run my card now?\" 
My purpose for asking was to see if he had the card on tab already or if he needed it back, or if he just wanted my permission.
His reply was: \"I'd rather you give me cash...don't you have cash?\"
Working in service all of my adult life there are very few things you can do that will cause me to stiff you. But this guy came close.

The next time we go is basically my last night out in Vegas before I moved. I'm trying to have a small celebration with some friends.
Same guy.
Getting drinks was like pulling teeth
My friend asked about the types of dressing options for her salad, and his answer was: \"ranch...and some other stuff....why? what ELSE do you want.?\"

Here's the bottom line...this place is awesome...as long as the one bartender is not working. If i'm ever back in town I'll probably swing in and have a drink...unless he's working...in which case I'll just drop off an application to Dick's last resort for him. He'd do well there."}
{"text":"Nice hole in the wall bar with video poker/blackjack machines. Adjacent to grill that serves bar food, sandwiches, burgers, wings, and Chinese food. Good amount of tv's to watch sports, pool table, dart boards and Golden Tee. Food was good and service is great. If you're in the area try stoping by and you will thank yourself for it."}
{"text":"Great Sunday Chargers sports bar.  Everyone is very friendly... Always receive great service from Melanie."}
{"text":"Needed a good spot for an after work beverage and bite, 7777 fit the bill!  We had great service by Jake and enjoyed a variety of options for dinner.  The place was hopping for a Thursday night, with music, poker and sports to keep you entertained.  Glad we popped in.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"I wish I would have had the chinese food here but I came too late :-( The chinese restaurant part closes at 7pm which I kinda feel is way too early for Vegas standards. But it's cool, I shall be back anyways...I kinda fell in love with this dive type sports bar :-) Cheep beers, good bar food and a bartender that explodes with attitude and personality ;-) I love it! This place is my comfort zone...I had a wonderful time just drinking, eating, playing pool and listening to 80's rock ;-) The cherry on top of my night....a regular hit the jackpot and paid for all our food ;-)"}
{"text":"5 stars because of the amount of games they have here! Shuffleboard is free, Fooseball is .75 cents, Pool is $1, and Darts were $3.50 for a cricket game of 4 people.  They also have a great beer special: $7 pitchers for domestic, non-craft! 
All the times I've gone it's been clean, the waitress and bartender are both friendly and I have a great time! 
The only thing that I'm a little confused about is the hours. It says on yelp that they're 24/7 but last time I went on Thursday, around 1am they turned off half of the lights, looked like they were completing closing procedures and I kept noticing the waitress and bartender looking at my group so I took that as a cue to leave. When we were checking out, they didn't say anything so I don't really know lol
But overall, a great place to hang out with friends. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Cool bar! Went here to watch the Charger game, was greeted by a few of the locals who treated me and the mrs. like regulars. Felt like home for the game, also won a raffle!. The burger was off the hook good. Hope you guys enjoy that charger helmet!... Take the bronco one down!

Timmy"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I must say that I have never been disappointed. Jake, not from State Farm, has always been my adult beverage server and has a great way of interacting with those he is serving. The food is fair in price and always great."}
{"text":"Night bartender is a  joke...tall older unhappy guy.  He fights with his co-workers, and if your not a regular you will wait and wait for your drinks."}
{"text":"Some of the most inexpensive drinks in town. $10 buckets! Chargers and Rams bar. Shocking, but the Chinese food is great. Been there several times and never been disappointed with the Asian fare. Great karaoke set up on the weekends."}
{"text":"Not sure how I missed this one but glad I finally checked it out.
Good location to begin with, easy to get in and out of the parking lot. I read that they have pool tables. That's a plus for me. A lot of so called 'sports bars' don't offer the beckoning appeal of soft green, or in this case, red felt of a good pool table AND pool cues that aren't as crooked as a dog's hind leg. $1 a game and $6 pitchers of draft (American) beer, and these are good size pitchers too.

The restaurant was closed for some reason, I didn't ask why but there was a sign posted. I didn't come here to eat but was a little strange why closed on a Saturday night.
They had a 3 piece band playing in the back room, just back enough as to be more background music...the karaoke started around 9 and that was fun. Some dude there was a ringer for Barry White.

Jake the bartender was very cool, he said he was the only one working and was pretty busy but when a bartender pours a fresh pitcher for you without being asked, that's a guy on the ball!
 I told him we'd be back for sure, and we will."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, welcoming owner and staff. Gonna be the newest San Diego Chargers bar in Vegas. Food is great, homemade Chinese food in addition to pizza calzones, burgers etc.  Give it a try Charger fans you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Thus place has horrible service. The pizza is good and cheap but not worth it. I am a waka kickballer and we go every Wednesday even though it takes 30 min to get a drink. Last night was the last time I and many others will ever be in that bar. The owner went nuts. Too make a long story short he said no rap in my bar (we have been playing it all season) and when asked about Beyonce he flipped out on a paying customer and said keep drinking you'll die sooner. And then kicked him out and physically pushed the costumer. The owner is creepy and seems drunk all the time. I would not recommend this bar to anyone ever for any reason."}
{"text":"Well i guess I found a new hangout spot!  Video gambling, BEER, Chinese food made by chiinese cook/owner, BEER, pool tables, fooseball, shuffleboard, BEER, Golden Tee, BEER..... and more BEER.....
The chinese food here rivals some places on spring mountain...! Pizza is good too... Met few of the bartenders, all service friendly.... Jake makes the BEST Long Island I have ever tasted.... a multiple award winner I hear.....
machines have paid out decent enuff....
I was apprehensive at first, but my curiosity cured that.... I like it here....had lunch twice in a week and stopped plenty for that after work BEER!!!!

I like it, I love it, I want some more of it ... !

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best food ever!!! They also serve Chinese food that's AMAZING!!! Totally a regular. Great great food!!! A definite must."}
{"text":"Love this place! Such fun bartenders, Jake is my favorite he's a ball buster!! So funny, good times!  The American food and Chinese food menus are great, one of the few places in Vegas with actually great Chinese food. pizzas are great on the American menu. This place is a staple in our menu of outings/bars/restaurants. Free wifi too! :) enjoy!"}
{"text":"WHY I CAME-- In town for the weekend and sought out a cool place to watch the San Diego Super Chargers. 90% of the tv's were on the chargers station. Would have been cool if the Chargers won, but it was still a great atmosphere.

WHAT I DRANK-- Pitcher of shocktop for $9 on football sundays.

WHAT I ATE-- The mild chicken wings were lacking flavor because it didn't have hot sauce. Tried the hot wings that my friend got, and they were alot better. Also ordered some chicken fried rice. Never had fried rice at a charger game, but it was a great alternative.

WHAT I SMELLED-- Cigarettes allowed in the house."}
{"text":"Located on the Westside of town,I can't in my right mind call this a dive bar, it's too nice! This is a fun little place, with great prices and great food, well I only had the wings, but they were great! They have a very friendly staff to boot.I should also mention the lights, you can actually see in this place, that is a big plus. If I find myself on that side of town I will stop by for sure, and I recommend you do the same. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"my wife and i do date night every thursday night.we tried every bar we could find only to find a lot of the same ol same ol.until we found this place.WOW what a good bar just to hang out and not be a trendy.the demographic is great.the service is great and the food very well priced and it seems every where people tell us there place is so great only to tast alot of the same.this place howerver great pizza and  chinese food etc..

enter JAKE,seemed a little distant at the time but the more orderd we realized hes one of the best bartenders in town.if you come to this place with a trendy motives or wanna be a princess well this is not the place for you.every one here is real and down to earth and the crowd follows from the bartender to the cooks to the owner.this is the only place we go and never seem to get tired of it.people ar nice and treat you good.give jake a chance and youll see he earns every dollar.hes a great guy.

we will always be loyal customers from here out.go try this place before to many people discover it:)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure when this place re-opened, but it is a total departure from the way it used to be. In a GREAT way!! Upon entering you are greeted by a big fish in an aquarium, and that's not where 7777 Bar & Grill proves it's unique! 
My husband and I wandered in at 930 the other night, out of the rain looking for Chinese food. After ordering a drink we find out the Chinese food is not offered after 9. In light of that, we kind of made a mutual (all be it non-verbal, kind of happily married for a long time Jedi type mind message, that nobody else can see) decision to finish the drink & head out. 
This is where it becomes exciting. At this point Jake, the bartender, apologizes like crazy. He offers us a happy hour/ football menu, which is a far cry from the extensive Chinese menu we were after. We glance over it, as a courtesy. Sticking to our original decision, (-now actually spoken, to save our Jedi powers.). We make designs to settle up & head back into the rain. When out of nowhere, the chef/cook (not sure of his title) Mike comes from the kitchen to talk to us & offer us amazing non-football food options. 
Between the bartender, Jake (works swing nearly every night) and the cook, Mike, and their collective efforts, we decided to stay. My husband got the chicken tacos and I got a fabulous Caesar salad. That and a couple more drinks and we had forgotten the missed Chinese we had come in for. 
On our way out we ran into the owner of the place, Ron. When we explained how nice his staff had been to us, especially under the circumstances, he seemed genuinely pleased & proud to hear they had been the sole reason we had stayed to eat, gamble & drink. 
This is a must stop, if you haven't already. These guys will restore your faith in the lost art f customer service. They deserve to have a thriving business & will raise the bar (no pun intended, sorry.) for customer service when you do. Local watering holes could take a page from these guys. Until they do, 7777 will have my business."}
{"text":"This is a great locals bar! They have good bar food, video poker and great service. Watch out for Jake! He's a great bartender and his sarcasm is part of his charm."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Jake is my new lucky charm. Two royals in two days....oh yeah!! They really know how to take care of their gamblers. :) Plus alot of other things for non-gamblers as well."}
{"text":"This place rocks! My boyfriend and I have so much fun each time we go. Between the pool tables, shuffle board, darts and Golden Tee, we are always entertained. Jake is a fantastic bartender with great stories and fast service. The food is good and the drinks are always reasonably priced. Even when it is packed. we have no trouble getting service and other patrons are happy to let us in on a game of pool or shuffle board."}
{"text":"A video poker bar with a full menu of Chinese food, and we were assured, and I quote, that there were \"real Chinamen\" in the kitchen cooking orders from tickets that print out in Chinese characters. At first, as a good liberal arts-educated citizen, my reaction was to be offended, but when I looked at my Taiwanese husband he just laughed. So, for this unexpected combination alone, they earn my early respect. And, yes, we did see the Chinese chef exit the kitchen at one point. 

The story is that the bar owner's girlfriend is Chinese, so she oversees the Chinese cuisine. The menu is legit featuring everything from hot pot to Chinese meatball. When we visited, we weren't starving, but we decided to order some pork and cabbage dumplings, and they had the appearance of being homemade: a little imperfectly shaped and filled with fresh pork. They were worth ordering again, but we would probably get them pan fried next time. 

The menu also features standard American grub alongside pizza that looked pretty good. It appeared that they had CSN students cooking in the kitchen. 

The other thing I like about this video poker spot is that there are lots of windows, so it is fairly bright. It isn't your typical cavernous Vegas bar. They have plenty of TVs for sports viewing complete with all the requisite sports \"passes,\" so they will have every NFL game, NBA game and the like. 

The spirit selection is decent, as is the beer selection. They have two Tenaya Creek brews on tap. They also have something happening almost every night from karaoke to comedy, and they have a pool table, foosball, electronic darts and Golden Tee. 

It's a good neighborhood spot, and the dumplings have definitely left me wanting to go back to try a few more of their Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"Very sad that Jake is gone. I will miss going here and watching the train wreck drunk owner stagger around. But I have to follow a great bartender when you find one"}
{"text":"Good food, the spicy shrimp is definitely spicy! Good service, very friendly and accommodating. And very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Chow Mien in Las Vegas!    Call ahead to make sure the chef is in.  They have a full menu, but this is my fav."}
{"text":"Pluses for having a shuffleboard table and not charging for it. Otherwise, yikes for how banged up it is. For being a local bar, the prices for drinks are not that inexpensive. 

A league forms on Saturday nights to play shuffleboard and it takes some time to get some play if you are not a part of it. It is a good thing that the table is not timed because to work around the sand and the grooves set into the table takes time.

The fact that they have a fooseball table, dart boards, pool table, golden tee, and a golden tee knockoff of bowling insures there are enough bar games to keep a large group occupied. 

The offerings for drinks is pretty basic and not very exciting."}
{"text":"This is a great Charger Bar.  It is clean for a bar of this style (I could take wife there).  We had the Everything pizza and it was really good.  All of the people are friendly and I will definitely be back next time I am in Vegas and I want to see a Charger game. They have plenty of TV's that all around the bar so there is not a bad seat.  They even have a room with a Huge screen with seating for around 20-25 people.  And to top it off, Ron the owner was a nice guy as well."}
{"text":"Great venue, Tuesday night all star jam was a great jam. Drew and Reno run a great jam and have so much great talent I love the plug n play set up they have. The house band was really a great band. My only beef was the very rude guy who was serving the tables and took my order got upset because I asked for water and a coffee but said he would get it, so I waited and he never delivered he walked by my table many times delivering everyone's orders to them well when the tables around me had gotten seconds and thirds I got tired of waiting and ordered from the bar. I really think the guy was a jerky for ignoring me all night."}
{"text":"Best bartenders in the business.  Food is on point.  Pizza is especially good with crispy crust. I've been coming in for over a year and never disappointed.  Karaoke a few nights a week with live music mixed in a well. We're never disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best bar in Vegas! And jake makes the best Long Island!!! Always great service and great food!!!"}
{"text":"Hmm... dive bar with games (pool table, shuffleboard, darts, etc.), TVs, good beer prices, and general homey feel?  Seems like it's perfectly set up to be the hangout spot.  Add the Chinese menu twist to that and you also have something pretty unique.  But I'm just not feeling it...

The good things:  The aforementioned games & TV screens; sports paraphernalia on the walls; decent wings and pizza; decent prices on beer.

The iffy things:  I felt like I was at one of those Lions Club cafeteria.  Not sure what it was, just the overall setting and atmosphere.; the service was good, but not overly pleasant nor efficient.  Food was okay, some things being good (fries), others just decent.

The not-so-good things:  Nothing here is bad, but a couple of minor complaints.  The wings were tiny - were they from undergrown baby chickens?  Tasted good though, not overly dry;  the bill came to $35/p, which we didn't think was a bargain based on what we had.

So I guess it will really depend on how comfortable you feel here, but for my money spent I think we could have asked for more.  I just didn't feel it was a $35/p type of a place or experience.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Perfect for that, they have a good-sized bar and atmosphere fits the bill just right."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!

The atmosphere is welcoming, laid back, and still very attentive. If you want some great food and for a reasonable price, come here. It's not what you expect when you think \"bar food.\" Jake, one of the bartenders, especially goes above and beyond for customers. 

Been coming here for awhile on a regular basis, won't stop. Always something new happening here( great live music, food specials). This place gives me a lot of what I like. Thanks 7777."}
{"text":"Still love this bar,  come here every Wednesday with kickball and at least one more night a week. Besides Uffe on Wednesdays there's karaoke on Thursday through Saturday which is a great time. Jake is still killing it behind the bar,  treat him right and he'll take care is you like no other bartender in town."}
