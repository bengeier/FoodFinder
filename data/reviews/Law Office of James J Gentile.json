{"text":"We recently updated our Trust and Will.  Mr. Gentile was very helpful in walking us through the entire process, and answered all of our questions.  Both Mr. Gentile and the office staff were very friendly and professional. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and courteous service, took the time to explain what I needed to know. I had a comfortable experience. I will certainly return. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Mr Gentile advised us on a number of legal matters. I agree with most users below. They are professional and extremely capable. Very approachable and easy to understand. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"The secretary was very nice and helpful when I called to schedule a consult. I needed up calling to cancel my appointment and spoke with a man, assuming he was Mr. Gentile as he did not identify himself. He was not very friendly and referred to my husband as \"un-informed\" and then proceeded to tell me to never listen to mortgage or real estate people but wouldn't tell me why when I asked. Based on this experience, I would not work with this law firm and I will not recommend them."}
{"text":"James Gentile was very informative, honest, and professional.  He took his time in explaining the bankruptcy process.  His staff was amazing!  His fees were very reasonable!  I would highly recommend him to anyone.  I have used their services for tax preparation and again, I was very pleased with the service."}
{"text":"Excellent and professional service.  I needed to get a new will.  Attorney James J. Gentile sat down with my wife and explained the will, trust and living will.  He took all of our information, assets, family information and called us back within the week.  Before signing multiple pages, he explained page by page the legal aspects for the will, trust and living will.  It was not a rush job, he spent over an hour explaining the will/trust to us.  We left his office with a will/trust that we felt covered my wife and my interest and was well informed regarding the legalities if something happened to my wife and I.  As mentioned earlier, excellent and professional service, I would highly recommend attorney James Gentile."}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing I can't say enough good things about the them! I was completely overwhelmed after being on disability for over ten years I had finally gotten back to working full time and all my bill collectors came for me! I was actively being garnished and more were lining up. I had no idea what my debt even was and then through a recommendation at work I ended up meeting with James.  He was direct told me exactly what to do and almost immediately the garnishment stopped.  A few months later my bankruptcy is closed and I can breath again!  They were always patient with me and answered all my questions twice.  They even worked out a payment plan so I didn't have to pay everything up front,  without their help I will still be drowning in debt and making it worse.  Thanks to James and his amazing team!!"}
{"text":"Debra Gentile is a excellent tax preparer I highly reccommend her she is very through and caring. Her number one priority is her customers."}
{"text":"I filed for bankruptcy with James Gentile. This is the only time I have ever filed so instead of getting a paralegal to file my paperwork, I paid an outrageous amount of money to make sure everything was done properly, explained to me thoroughly and there to represent me in court. Well, regrettably, I signed a contract with James Gentile to do the exact same thing a paralegal would have done. The only difference was he was there in court but answered maybe 2 questions while at the trustee meeting.  James Gentile and his office staff are completely unorganized, rude, unaccommodating and inefficient. They act as if you're a burden and as if you're not the one paying THEM $2000 to stay on top of their stuff. They asked me for paperwork Multiple times that I had already turned in. They kept forgetting my situation and so they would call me to turn in things that I wasn't even required to. Jim obviously wouldn't look at any of my paperwork before I would get a rude phone call from them saying they need something immediately. They didn't go over my list of accounts with me before they sent the paperwork in so I had to do an addendum to add 2 accounts. They said I should have looked through the accounts, like this is something I should have known to do when they pulled me into their office and rushed me to sign the papers to file that had the accounts on them? They pulled everything from my credit so being that this is the only time I have filed, I figured that would have included everything but it didn't.  Totally not even worth $200 that it would have cost for a paralegal because I ended up needing to double and triple check everything on my end. And to still be receiving calls from his rude office staff stating that they need things they already got and I have already been discharged. I just got home with my newborn and this is the first phone call I get. Totally ruined my mood. DO NOT GO TO THESE PEOPLE. THEY ARE CROOKS. I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL I AM DONE PAYING THEM FOR NOTHING AND THEY ARE PUT IN THE PAST!!!!"}
