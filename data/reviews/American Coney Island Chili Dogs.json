{"text":"Ruining a good brand by taking short cuts in prep. Turn heat on grill and keep dogs & chili hot. Born & raised in D. Had to hurry back home to get real deal and wash taste out my mouth!"}
{"text":"There is only one Coney Island no matter what others may think. This is Brooklyn, New York home to my favorite hot dog, Nathans. I tried American Coney Island and it was some of the worst hot dogs I have had in my life. I tried the whole chili, onions, and mustard. I found this hot dog to be repulsive. There is no way I would recommend these hot dogs to anybody. I know they have other food items besides hotdogs which I did not try. The original Coney Dog will always be a Nathans hot dog hands down. Nothing even comes close to this. American Coney Island should actually consider adding flavor to their dogs. Instead of using pork products, why not use beef which would make the hot dog taste so much better. If one is really hungry, I suggest heading over to Pop Up Pizza at the Plaza Hotel, or Pizza Rock by the new Downtown Grand hotel. Now these places have damn good pizza."}
{"text":"I'm not overly fussy but kInd of disappointed. The price was right but my coney was barely covered with chili stuffs.  Did not give me a fork and spoon until I asked. But I could have eaten with my fingers if I were not fussy. Wait. I'm not fussy!  3 stars but I prefer the original in Detwah."}
{"text":"I didn't think my hot dog was anything special.  It was okay, maybe cause I don't like chili that much.  I think the hot dogs at Costco taste better.  The french fries were also lackluster, and tasted like they were frozen/store bought.  The place itself is small, so groups of more than four people will have a hard time finding a place to sit together.  Also, I think there's an entrance on Fremont St, which is the quicker/easier entrance to the restaurant.  Otherwise, getting to the restaurant through the D's entrance on 4th is sort of like weaving through a maze . . . ."}
{"text":"I stayed at the D today and walked into this little hot dog shop. Although the menu was limited, which isn't necessarily a negative, what they do sell seems to be quite tasty. I had a Coney dog and some chili cheese fries. I enjoyed both items, the highlight being the delicious chilli.  That being said, would I make it a point of emphasis to make a return visit? Not necessarily. This place is good if you're craving something quick and cheap (or drunk at 2am). Like the Heart Attack Grill, the novelty of eating there lasts for about one visit."}
{"text":"The chili dog looks and tastes like cat vomit.  I took one bite and tossed it.  Keep walking, this place SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Worst Hot Dog I've had in 20 years. If you come in here expecting an authentic Coney Island hot dog you will be truly disappointed. Dog was fried, skin was hard from being on the grill too long. First and only time I will visit here."}
{"text":"The BEST Gyros West of the Mississippi! (Hope I spelled it correctly)  While I am spoiled by Chicago Vienna hot dogs, I have not tried and will not review the hot dogs here at American Coney Island, so this review is based solely on what I consider to be the BEST gyros and customer service West of the \"Deep River\"!  Living in Los Angeles, it is nearly impossible to find GOOD authentic and fresh gyros that is cut of the spit.  The only places you will find it is at the seasonal Greek festivals around Easter time.  It saddens me that the closest place to get great gyros is on Fremont Street in Downtown Las Vegas, but hey.....1 more reason to visit Sin City.  Upon my arrival at American Coney Island that is located in my favorite LV Casino \"The D\", I was met by mario, the restaurant manager.  Simply put Mario...ROCKS!  I like my gyros cooked and prepared special.  I like it CRISPY around the edges, a tad well done, and NOT finished on the grill.  So I asked mario if he could accommodate my special requests and he was more than happy to do so.  He told me to give him 20 minutes while he raised the heat on the spit and began to prepare my custom gyros order...perfect, gives me 20 minutes to hit Video Poker while I waited.  A 4 Deuces Jackpot, and 20 minutes later I came back to the a most BEAUTIFUL site; A perfectly cooked and over stuffed fresh gyros sandwich with my name on it!  It was a gorgeous site in deed as I savored every wonderful bite!  Gyros SO GOOD I wanted to crawl under the table like a dog and not be disturbed while SMACKING it down!    Mario walked over to me and asked if it was to my liking and I told him he was Magic!  He did and excellent job!!    THE BOTTOM LINE: As stated above, this place has the BEST gyros and customer service West of the Mississippi!  This has become my favorite lunch spot and midnight snack shop while in LV!  Mario....keep up the good work!  I'll be back!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is most defiantly tied to memories of home but the negative reviews of this place out silly.   This place is in Las Vegas. On Fremont no less; getting upset that these hotdogs and fries are not up to an idealized standard is like being pissed that the Paris doesn't have the tip top bistro and cafe you remember when you drunkenly back packed through Europe. Do you refuse to set foot in Caesars because the busts of Roman emperors appears out of chronological order? Vegas has made a name for itself in cheap accessible entertainment and food that appeals to the masses. And is damn good.   As far as chili dogs and fries go, this place won't disappoint. Basic fair that is done really well and served in less than 40 seconds. Stumble in, inhale everything in site, contemplate how you will work of the food crimes you committed, and continue the party.   Eat here. Stop reading, eat here."}
{"text":"Pretty good chili cheese dog in the middle of the night on fremont. People on this street at night are sketchy but this place made the trek worth it"}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was great. Being from the east coast and now living in California this was a very pleasant surprise while visiting Las Vegas.  Good quality dog , steamed bun and great fixings. So good I went back three times  Great customer service and very friendly folks working there. Looking forward to my next visit during Vegas Bike Fest in Oct ."}
{"text":"It was okay if you are really hungry and need something to eat. And you cant get refills on your softdrinks and they only have a small selection of sodas too. However, their fries were really good."}
{"text":"Detroit coney island in Las Vegas. As good as the original, highly recommended. The staff was super friendly and nice. Coney dogs are top notch. Will be back every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit and love a good Coney dog but this Jerk ruined it with his shrewd attitude.  I now live in Las Vegas and was in the area.  I ask if there are any military discounts and he replied so quick and nonchalantly one could surely take offense.  Then I ask if there are 'industry' discounts, he asks what industry and I tell him (Chris or Drew- the black guy with hazel eyes) that I'm a bartender.  He says no again so I try to joke it up with him to cool things out and he blatantly brushes it off in a hurried manner as if I'm bothering him.  To top it all off, my pop was a little more than half full that he fixed for me and he did not provide me with a fork which I do believe is standard.   It makes me want to just keep going to Hot Doggery on the strip and their not as good but the customer service is GREAT!!!   This guy is acting like I was trying to pick up on him; honey after 8 years serving my country I think I've come across some with better jobs than your arrogant for no reason behind!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best chili dog ever!  At 3AM and not inebriated, it was hard to find food that was open.  But my surprise turned to shock when I found American Coney Island!  The chili was perfect, the onions had the right oomph, and the mustard was excellent.  But none of them could match the SNAP of the natural casing!    Apparently this is a Detroit original, as some of the staff were straight from there.  Maybe that's why they weren't very happy to be there.  The place was pretty thrashed too, but I'm not sure if that was the staff's fault or the patrons.  But the food made everything ok.  I'll be back, and this time I'll buy two, maybe even three."}
{"text":"Amongst the bevy of cheap, gut busting foods along the Freemont Experience including pizza, \"White Castle\" sliders, tacos, and doughnuts, American Coney Island was the poison I picked this night.  The eatery boasts name-brand appeal and some history, however, their actual product here brought some shame to the storied dog's legend.  I chose the coney island dog with fries and a soda.  The hot dog was small with nothing to differentiate it from any other hot dog.  The chili and onions added some flavor to it, but only elicited a \"meh\" from me.  The fries were it's saving grace as at least they were crispy and decent.    It's a decent option, but there are probably much better options to spend your $10 on."}
{"text":"You had me at gyro!  I went to American Coney Island to try the dogs but decided on the gyro instead.  It was as good as those I've had at most greek restaurants.  I get it every time I go and still haven't tried their dogs.  I have tried the fries and they are very good.  The only negative is that their menu is basically dogs, gyros, fries, chili, and cheese so it might not please everyone."}
{"text":"Ever since arriving in the old Vegas strip I had been eyeing these hot dogs locations. There are many different ones but this one stood out because of the Coney Island name. It really helped that i had a huge craving for a hot dog like this and also the fact i was pretty intoxicated at the time. However there is one particular aspect of this hot dog that you can't ignore. The crunch the link has is rare. The moment you bite it you have that casing crunch that is so satisfying but also highlights how well cooked the wieners are. You will not find a hot dog like this where I'm from. The cheese is fresh and melts perfectly in seconds. The guys working there are really cool and were friendly enough to help us choose what the best option for vacationers like us. It is a quick bite to eat that will really satisfy your craving for a sloppy coney island hot dog. Do not pass by this place without trying it."}
{"text":"I really wasn't expecting much when I walked into this gem tucked under the D. Just another drunk night cruising the Fremont Experience. As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted by the very friendly cashier.  The staff was very polite and professional. I ordered a basic coney the way they suggested and it was the best chili dog I've ever had. The hot dog had a great snap and was very juicy. The chili was classic homemade style chili. Not spicy. Onions were fresh and cheese was great! Even the mustard was quality.  So, before I know it I've had 3 conies and chili cheese fries. Great job American Coney Island. Great experience! You've become my go to place in Fremont."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST have when in Vegas. The staff is always quick and on point with their service and I have to mention they all greet you like they've known you forever. The food is GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"I walked I to this establishment as Captain Jack Sparrow with Wolverine last night and were immediately advised that our kind were not allowed to be served or welcome in their establishment because of our profession.  I could not understand how in this day and age I was being denied service because I was different.  So to clarify I asked the young black man at the counter to tell me if it was because of my sex, gender, race, creed, color, religion, or other reason and his response was, \"No man.  I'm black.\" Really? #Descrimination #CivilRights #MLK #BuskersNotAllowed #Boycott"}
{"text":"Probably poison. Don't care. Delicious."}
{"text":"I always get the dog with the loose meat and no chili due to the fact my stomach can.t handle chili that much well big mistake the loose meat tasted like it had a whole container dumped in it,  And I get the loose meat: sandwiches all the time and never had this issue. I will be back because they are usually delicious.. Could be a bit cheaper though I mean 5 bucks for just a chili dog?"}
{"text":"Real coney dogs from Detroiters! All the ingredients are the same thing you'll get in a Detroit coney. Service is super fast as coneys always are. The location is superb, and they are open all night so after you realize you need a little food to combat that sixth or seventh drink, stop in and grab some motor city comfort food. Coney dog, loose burger, and chili cheese fries are part of what makes life worth living. I can't wait to stop in again later this week!"}
{"text":"One of the best hot dogs in Las Vegas. Some say the best. Greek-style chili dogs. Fast friendly service."}
{"text":"The worst! Should be reported for the good poisoning I got. Sick all day in my room on Sunday. The hot dog was so tough couldn't chew it and what I did get down got me in the bathroom sick all day and missed my Love show because of a damn hot dog!"}
{"text":"A packed Freemont Street in Vegas....I mean packed with people and this little place could save your appetite if you plan to drink or have been drinking. Probably the cheapest place in Vegas, for 4-6 bucks you can get a Coney Dog just the way you like it ..... add extra chili, onions and or cheese. Add fries for just a couple bucks more. Seating area is small and there is a stand up bar which is an option when packed. Usually a line to order, but service was really quick! Connected to The D Casino in the back, there is a lot of foot traffic. No one bothered us when we brought in our drinks from the street, but they sell water and pop."}
{"text":"Oh a taste of home! Being from Metro-Detroit and now living in Vegas I crave coney dogs... There used to be a place in downtown Henderson but it closed but soon as they did these guys opened up!   Full confession... I'm a Kerby's fan. But I'll take what I can get out here!!! Everything is shipped in from Detroit so the chili is just like at home and so are the dogs. They even have Gyro's!!! The only downside is that they are in the middle of Fremont street, which is great to catch tourists but us locals don't want to be around those people more than we have to.  Oh and the only other minus is... no Faygo! If they started carrying Faygo they'd be over the top amazing"}
{"text":"Worst Chili Dog I have ever had. Way over priced. Drinks were flat. The chili tasted like it was warmed up in a plastic bag. The cheese seemed like imitation. The restaurant smelled bad and was small. It smelled like body odor and urine. I would not return here even for free food. There is no key."}
{"text":"A pretty long line at first around 12:30am. However, it went by really fast and they serve the food really quick as well.  Got the chili con fries and hotdogs. Not that amazing but good for a quick meal. Love that they add so much chili con on their food :)."}
{"text":"This dog is the best this side of the East Coast. Made my whole trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"We had really bad service the hot dog isn't all that good they forgot to give us our drinks we had to go back not friendly at all hot dogs are too expensive it's not all that"}
{"text":"This place gave me nasty over cooked hot dogs, the fries over cooked mixed with undercooked, best part was my MR Pibb. The service was bad had better luck with a wet mop. Must been here on a bad day. But we all got nasty food. 1/28/2015 11:30am  really would never come back. I had to post a star wouldn't let me post with out choosing at least one."}
{"text":"This place is good.  Chili, hot dogs, fries...what's not to like???  I went 2-3 times while I was here in Vegas...hence the 5 lbs I seemed to have come away with!  Better than most fast food...."}
{"text":"One of our favorite quick places to eat when we are down on Fremont! We usually end the night with a 'American Special'. Also have had the chili fries - Yum! There isn't a lot of seating inside though, but we mostly take them to go. Can be pretty messy so we always ask for fork and knife. The workers here are always smiling, helpful and happy."}
{"text":"The Coney Island Hotdogs here are great!   They consist of chili, yellow mustard, and white onions. The hot dog itself I believe was $3.99 and is pretty the size of a regular hot dog you would buy at the store.   Service was \"w.e\". Definitely didn't expect service to be outstanding, but the staff seemed ready to get out of there.  If you're going to visit Fremont st definitely stop by! They also have burgers and chili cheese fries, which looked really good. :)"}
{"text":"If you like quality hot dogs, you'll love it here. Excellent dogs at a cheap price. I went with the standard dog, on which they add onions, chili, and a few other ingredients.   Very cool people working behind the counter, enough seating, and best of all - open 24/7!  I only wish they had a fixins bar so I could add jalapenos and stuff. They do have drinks and fries available.   But come on in any time, day or night. You'll love it here."}
{"text":"So my bf and I stumbled upon this place and we're very glad we came in. Staff welcomed us immediately, we ordered the standard chili dog. Hot dog bun was soft in texture with a bit of a crisp, the dog had great flavors with a snap, and that chili... yum. Now in no way can I compare this to Coney Island... but my overall experience was great. For the price, the fact that you want a dog that late at night, sounds good to me!"}
{"text":"Even while heavily intoxicated I was not impressed with the gyros. But I was hungry as shit so I gobbled it down anyways. The service was friendly and tolerable of my drunken companion... even participated in his Snapchat video. The chili cheese fries were alright. They're definitely loaded with chili so if that is your thing, this is your spot.   I wouldn't make it a point to stop here sober. There's a reason this place is nestled in the middle of the Fremont experience... and that is to satisfy your ridiculous drunk cravings.   Perhaps on another night I will try the hot dogs... but if they're as dry seeming as the gyro, I'm not sure that I would be that impressed."}
{"text":"It was late at night and I wanted a hot dog. What are the chances I would walk by a place that served them? Turns out there are a ton of places along Fremont Street that do.  My hot dog was like $4 and while not as long/huge as I expected had a good flavor and texture, the chili was good and I liked it.  For what I paid, I was in and out with a fresh hot dog in my hand in under five minutes.  That's a-ok in my book."}
{"text":"Just good old fashioned late night drunk food. I travel to Detroit every year and Coney Dogs always end a night of drunken debauchery. Coney dogs (chilli, onion and mustard only for this guy) and a side of chilli cheese fries will give you that late night satisfactions early morning heartburn you crave when drunk. Nothing fancy here, you know what your getting and it's oh so good..."}
{"text":"Hot dog was super tasty..wish they had a bigger selection but I guess that's not what they are going for..my chili cheese fries were the shit also..definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"The workers there were really nice and friendly.  Food came out quick.  The hot dogs do taste like plastic.  Read that from an earlier review by someone.  There dogs are not worth the price you pay for.  Guess Fremont Experience is learning to over charge the tourist just like the Strip.  I would not go there again."}
{"text":"Im a Chicago guy when it comes to food but although Coney Island is a Detroit Cuisine, they got the gyros and the dogs are good.  The late night staff are the greatest group of guys in Vegas.  They got some good jokes."}
{"text":"I love the food it was very on point and very desirable :) the staff is always very courteous and helpful and polite !! I enjoy being helped by riley who is usually the one I  run in to that work when I come in late with my nighttime cravings:)  she is very respectful,  & knows how to make a customer feel welcome !! Great establish the keep up the great work#! I will be for sure returning for more of my nightly hot dog delights :) see you soon"}
{"text":"Had a coney with onions cheese and ketchup, it was f*cking great and hit the spot. Don't hesitate to eat here if you like a good tubesteak."}
{"text":"I have some friends from Detroit who suggested that I visit Coney Island for some great chilli dogs, so I made it a priority to visit. Located inside the D casino, it's a great stop for tourists and locals alike. Justin, the GM, was friendly, helpful, and informative. Zach \"Canada\" made my hot dog and it was delicious. He was funny and prompt. Great expirience for a quick bite at a downtown venue."}
{"text":"My gyro was overcooked and dry.  The pita bread was burnt at the edges.  My friend enjoyed his coney dog and the fries were hot and crispy.  It's greasy, overpriced fast food but you know that going in."}
{"text":"The hotdog alone is enough to warrant 4 stars... Yes the place is a dive and the employees aren't that friendly, but these are the best hot dogs ever ! Even loaded the hot dogs aren't overwhelmingly greasy tasting. If you are on Fremont and by the D hotel this place is a MUST try. Our hotel was on the main strip but came to Fremont twice just for the hotdogs :-)"}
{"text":"This place is what I would consider a dive.  The employees are not super happy to be there and they have the typical under paid worker in a shitty job type attitude.  This is what I expect in a place like this.   The food is soooo bad for you!   But it is oh so good :-)  Hot dogs with all sorts of calorie laden toppings.  I had a chili cheese dog and an order of fries.   Every.  Single. Bite.  Was absolute heaven.  These hot dogs are the food version of crack.    As is with crack, once the euphoria wore off, my stomach and body made me regret every bite.  This is just the way things work in the world of food like this.  Was it worth it?  Hell Yes!  The food was a little pricey but this is Vegas.  If you have an iron stomach or think you can handle the reprocussions of consuming super yummy high calorie, processed, junk food, make this a stop on your agenda."}
{"text":"I got it to go at 01:30 on 10/17/16, Not a long line. Got 2 for about $7.00.  I liked it. The place was clean, fast and friendly. Sorry no pics, I ate them on the go."}
{"text":"Coneys are on point, chili cheese fries are good but should come with liquid cheese not shredded... if you ask my friend. Lol. One thing I'm missing though is a Vernors. It's just not the same experience that I got back home in Michigan without an ice cold Vernors or Boston Cooler."}
{"text":"Their product was consistent with what I expected. The chili dog was great. The fries on the other hand were just the frozen out of the bag type and could be much better. The staff didn't find humor in my suggestion that they move down their next door Detroit rival http://www.yelp.com/biz/lafayette-coney-island-detroit   which is the Penn to their Teller. IDK looks like someone's running from something if you ask me."}
{"text":"Went in here a few times this week, food was fast and good as usual.  Blonde girl on the counter was cool too."}
{"text":"if you're drunk at 11PM (or sober and just feeling like good ol unhealthy food), this spot is quick and tasty. not necessarily the Coney of Detroit or NYC, but it's almost midnight and you're sloshed, so for all you know you're enjoying a fine sausage in Berlin. regardless, the dog had a firm casing and a juicy bite. the nun was nice and toasted. loose burger was a little dry, but not too bad. the staff was also friendly and patient, quite a testament considering the amount of inebriated and annoyingly demanding customers they get at this time of night."}
{"text":"A-Okay and three star rating for me . The eponymous name \" American Coney Island Chili Dogs\" sounds tastier than the actual hot dogs served. I'm not berating them but the hot dogs were average. not too many choices, I know it's a classic old school venue. Years back as a kid I even tried their dogs back on Coney Island. The prices are okay. The dogs tasted like they were steamed, boiled and/or lightly grilled. My fogy post drink memory does not recall seeing or smelling an actual fire grill.  I would say the famed Los Angeles icon \" Pink's\" wins hands down over Coney Island Chili Dogs: more variety , better taste."}
{"text":"This place is good, hit the spot at 2-3am!! Although I just wanted a dog, no chili but whatever it went down and stayed down good and didn't upset my stomach the next day ;) the fries were awesome as well - and it's a budget deal too!! We were there 10/28. I'd been here before and it was just as good the second time. The line moves swiftly, it's clean and there's no drama! They could have more condiments out, there was one bottle of ketchup on the main order counter and that was it."}
{"text":"Had some chili cheese fries from these guys last night(well early this morning) it was 3am and we wanted to eat.  They were  so nice. They held great convo with us while making our food. The chili cheese fries were reasonable priced and sooooooo good.  I would go again! They packed up To go for us and we enjoyed the food in our hotel. They are 24 hours. That's totally awesome. I wish I would have gotten the guys  names.  One was from Georgia and the other the east coast! They were extremely nice to us!!! Thank you all for the early morning snack !!"}
{"text":"It'll do. And I could practically conclude my review right there with \"It'll do\". When you're hungry and down on Fremont, it'll do. When it's 3:00am, it'll do. When you're staying at The D, it'll do. When you want a hot dog, it'll do. So yeah, it'll do. It's not great. It's not bad. It'll do.  This is a 24-hour spot located in The D (formerly Fitzgerald's). It's accessible from both inside The D, as well as directly off Fremont St. And this means you'll no doubt see some interesting characters in here.  The hot dogs aren't cheap (just under $4), but they're far from expensive. The dogs themselves are good and a better quality than the cheapie ones you find at other Fremont spots. The chili is alright. Cheese doesn't come on it unless you ask. The fries are completed average. You get a decent portion of them. They also serve gyros. But why get a gyro from a hot dog place?  Bottom line, it'll do."}
{"text":"Best chili dogs in Las Vegas! Cheese fries are great!  Awesome place after enjoying the bands on Freemont!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and great service. My kid got the looser burger, I got a chili dog and also a yummy hot dog. Awesome place to get out if the heat when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had a coney island dog without mustard and onoins and wasn't impressed with the taste. The fries where average with no salt.  Did see the lots of people ordering the Gyro, which \"looked\" tasty. Next time I'll give it a try."}
{"text":"24/7 chili dogs!!   One of the best chili dogs I have ever had- very clean & fast service. You must try it out when you are on Fremont street!"}
{"text":"Skip the Gyro.  It's average, at best.  But the natural casing hot dogs, with chili, onions and mustard are excellent. They serve soft drinks with too much ice.   Staff is generally nice.   BIG GRIPE: they serve everything in styrofoam containers. This is AWFUL for our environment. Paper, bamboo, etc make great containers and don't harm as much.  It's 2015, this needs immediate attention!"}
{"text":"Delicious chili dog! The wiener snaps when you bite into it! Perfect amount of onions and mustard. The chili itself is very good. Kinda pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"You can definitely tell there is a difference between the dogs they use here versus a \"normal\" dog, essentially the casing. Besides that, I'm not super impressed with this place although I realize it's a historic place in Detroit. I had the gyro once but it was late so I will reserve judgment since it was offer The fries are your typical fries from Sysco with regular cheese sauce that you'd expect on movie theater nachos. The price is very reasonable, though, so if you're in the area and looking for a quick snack you could do worse."}
{"text":"Had the gyro was amazing!!!!!!!  wanted more the cashier was awesome and friendly staff was great loved it..  Thinking of coming tomorrow again"}

{"text":"I good friend told me about American coney dog while they had a location in Los Angeles. Him being from Michigan, he told me all about the history of the coney dog. I became a fan instantly. After downtown Las Vegas opened up a location, this was a go to spot to enjoy a nice coney dog. (until I get to visit the original American & Lafayette coney dog in MI."}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit and was in Las Vegas for the first time.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see American Coney Island in Las Vegas as we exited \"The D\" Casino.  I had a Gyro, which was very delicious, as expected, just like it would be at their Detroit location.  I've never been into Coney Dogs, but everybody else seems to be.  I like that their Gyro is on the spit... I feel like it's more authentic that way.  If you've never had one, the Gyro meat is Lamb and Beef (around 80% Lamb, 20% beef).  Also, in case you don't know, a Coney dog is topped with chili and onions.    ...I had to chuckle when a customer walked in after us and said \"What's a JYRO?\" (That is, a Gyro, pronounced wrong), but I guess if you didn't grow up around Greek people or in the Detroit area you might have no idea."}
{"text":"This is a fairly good cut in the wall that would satisfy one's drunken night food binge. Although a lil dirty  the staff is very calm and courteous and one even sounds like Elvis ..in Vegas this sounds about right  i had the gyro  and  surprise it was really good... stopping in here wasn't a bad choice"}
{"text":"Walked over there to get one of there american party pack kits . Don't bother , they dont sell them . So if you are going there for a kit to go its a waste of time .  Nuff said ..."}
{"text":"Coney dog and chili cheese fries were good. Great spot for late night munchies. Can't believe all the times I've visited Vegas I've never stopped in. Crazy busy the entire time we where there, quick turnover. A plus the next time we visit."}
{"text":"I think I expected something else when I heard we were eating at American Coney Island. Maybe like, a full 50s-themed diner or something?   Anyway, it's tucked away in a small corner of the D casino & hotel, right on the Fremont strip. They have coneys and fries and that's about it. About a dozen tables and an environment that says \"eat, and go, please\".  But when you're starving and a little drunk (like I was), this place hits the spot and saves you a few bucks you can lose at the slots instead."}
{"text":"Had a dog before the night began. Ordered just a dog with mustard, onions. Friend had the chili dog with onions and mustard. Pretty standard hot dog, not much \"wow\" factor.  The fries, I agree with other posters, tasted like frozen fries.  Very small counter area for ordering, and very very small dining area. Staff was very friendly and efficient. I think based on previous reviews, they may have replaced the staff or trained them because we had no problems ordering or with our food."}
{"text":"24 hour hot dog place located at Downtown Las Vegas. The menu is kept simple and basic. Prices alright, but the hot dogs were below my expectations. The hot dogs tasted like they were either boiled or grilled. I did like the chili cheese fries, however.  The staff is friendly and the interior decor is nice."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as I thought it would be. A friend told me it was better than pink's, so I had to try it. I got a chili cheese dog and I seriously think that sonic has a better one for half the price."}
{"text":"Best coney dog I've had in thirty years; friendly staff made the experience worth it!"}
{"text":"Good dogs, good chili. Nice snack while cruising Fremont street. Will stop again while I'm here the rest of thecweek."}
{"text":"Sooo happy American Coney Island opened here! I am orginally from Michigan and moved to Vegas in April. I have been craving some REALLY GOOD chili fries. This experience was exactly what I needed. I ordered the loose burger ( I don't eat hotdogs) plain which came in a soft hotdog bun and was somertherd in chili. I also ordered chili fries and the fries hot. My only suggestion( why I only gave 4 stars) is that they serve Michigan pop ie Vernors, Faygo and as another customer suggested Better Made potato chips .I will recommed this place to friends and tourists and plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"Great location - mid fremont st  Quality product - quite  tasty in fact  Good pricing -  Super speedy service  If ya wanna a dog , and you are downtown head on by , you will be glad you did"}
{"text":"Updating my original review and upgrading to 4-stars ...  My first experience at American Coney Island came after losing a HUGE pot on the river at the Golden Nugget Poker Room. I needed some (very) late night comfort food, and remembered my friend recommending American Coney down the street at \"The D\" (which, incidentally, is the most unfortunate name for a casino ever) They specialize in Coney Island Hot Dogs which are, oddly enough, a Michigan staple food. Despite the time of night, the service was prompt and polite, and I was quickly served two Coney Dogs.   My first impression was that they were good hot dogs, but maybe not worth the price. The hot dog was of excellent quality, with that signature \"snap\" that a Coney Dog is supposed to have. The chili - or \"Coney Sauce as they call it in Michigan - was a bit on the bland side. It was good, but I didn't feel like it stood out over any other hot dog chili I had before.  Maybe I was just in a sour puss mood because of dropping my pocket aces on a bad river beat, because I went there a few days later and enjoyed them much more. It was even later at night (pushing morning on this visit) but the service was cheery and fast. The hot dog was as great as before, but the chili really stood out this time. And even more so on the chili cheese fries I got as an accompaniment on this visit. I went the second time out of sheer convenience - I was playing late night \"old school\" slots at The D - but I'll be craving these Coney Dogs on future visits. After the second visit, I had to upgrade my 3.5 stars to a full 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ate here for a late night snack.  Chili didn't do it for me as it tasted average.  I was expecting some \"kick\" to it but it was plain average.  Since I only ate there once I plan to go back again to see if my impression has changed."}
{"text":"Being from Michigan & not having been home in a couple years, my wife & I were very excited to stumble across this place. Simple, awesome food, friendly staff and great prices...in fact lunch was so good that we wound up back for a late dinner 10 hours later!!! Do yourself a favor & check this place out."}
{"text":"This Detroit Hot Dog restaurant is Legendary in Detroit and I first heard about them on a Food Channel Program. So when I heard that they had opened a shop in The D Hotel and Casino (Formerly Fitzgerald's) I had to give it a try and see what all the fuss was about. The shop is located on the far East entrance off of Freemont Streets Covered Pedestrain walkway and is quite small & cozy with about 20 or so tables that seat 2 to 4 people and there is a counter lining one wall to stand and eat. On the day I  visited there was no line and I was pleasantly greeted by the girl behind the counter taking orders. I ordered the Coney Island Dog which came on a soft white steamed bun and included Mustard, chili and onions and with tax came to $4. The service was fast with hardly any wait at all in receiving my order. Overall I dont see what all the fuss was/is about. While the hot dog itself did have a physical \"snap\" to it when I bit into it, over all it was \"just another Hot Dog\" and about $1.50 overpriced in my opinion. Pinks is still TOPS on my list and is THE BEST, most memorable Hot Dog I have ever had = Almost a foot long, covered in chili, avocado, tomato & onions. OMG!! In any case, if you are on Freemont Street give them a try, but if you are looking for value for your buck with a punch, stick with the old 7-11 standard $1.99 Big Bite."}
{"text":"It's ok for something to hold you over but IDK if I'd pay $4 again for a thin small hot dog. Chill is good but not delicious..."}
{"text":"If you want a real coney come here!! If your drunk, anything taste good, but the fact that I am familiar with this place have lived in Michigan for 12 years, my drunk butt was really excited lol  We walked through the casino, and I seen the sign, and I thought it was just a sign, but when we walked around more BOOM! HEAVEN! Prices are really reasonable! $3.75 I believe for the Coney! So good! Staff was happy and friendly.  Oh and I asked if I could have a hat that had the original address on it with their location, the kid behind the counter was nice enough to give me his."}
{"text":"Best hot dog downtown Las Vegas. That's not saying much. Make sure you drink a lot beer first so you won't feel guilty about eating this tasty junk food."}
{"text":"I had a hot dog and fries here, wasnt too impressed.  I think the price was a bit high, considering you are in vegas.  I mean you canget all u can eat buffet for $10 or a hot dog combo here for the same price."}
{"text":"When I am walking down Fremont and I see a little hot dog spot that looks like it belongs in Chicago or NY, I get high expectations.  This was a decent dog. A decent over priced Las Vegas strip dog anyway.  Nothing special about it. I would have given them 3 stars for being average, but when you act like you hate your job, you lose a star. Sorry, not sorry?  I had cheese and onions, and the boyfriend had the same with chili. Don't get me wrong it was better than Weinersnitchel or however you spell that gross place. But it wasnt an American Coney Island hot dog. Trust me I've had em! I'd take a sabrett off a street corner over this any day! Skip this place and go to the many new downtown spots that are worth being overpriced."}
{"text":"first time eating a coney dog and omg for real drunk food!!! it was delicious and messy cant get any better than that."}
{"text":"This place is nothing close to the original one in Detroit.  Not terrible, but absolutely no sizzle."}
{"text":"Nowhere in Nevada can you get a better Coney Dog, or MY favorite, the Gyro!!! I ride 15 miles each way to treat myself to one of their Gyros slathered with extra taziki sauce, served with a flair from MarcAnthony!! What a wonderful personality!!! I took his suggestion and had a Loose Burger with Taziki sauce..... and MMMMMMMMMMMM!! SO VERY YUMMY!!! The Coney Dog with onions and chili are THE BOMB good too!! And the french fries?! Crispy & good :) .....Keep up the great food & service with a smile MarcAnthony"}
{"text":"I have been to the original in Detroit and this place does it just like the real one.  Open 24 hours to get a good taste at anytime."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I was just hungry but the service was extremely friendly and the chili dog was great.  Especially for the cost of under $4.  It's a great place to stop by for quick bite right on the Fremont Street Experience"}
{"text":"As a native Detroiter, I appreciate this place.  So does Derek Stevens, the owner of the D who's from Detroit and imported a taste of home when he moved to Vegas.  Now the \"chili\" served here is NOT Tex-Mex -- its more like a Greek spaghetti sauce.  Very mild with a unique flavor.  American Coney is THE original hot dog place in Detroit, and it spawned other SE Mich chains such as Leo's, National, and Kerby's.  The prices on Fremont St are touristy, yes, but if you got a hankering for a great dog with good snap and a unique Greek chili sauce, this place serves it up nicely.  Last time I was here, I had a gyro sandwich at 4am for about six bucks and it really hit the spot too.  Great nightcap."}
{"text":"My new found love for Fremont has had me try lots of new things and places and this joint is one of them. I'd walked by it a few dozen times during my last two Vegas visits but never had the guts to try it until I had a few partners in crime and only once the alcohol base coat had settled in.  Okay, if you order anything without chili on it here I think you've already made a mistake. If it's in the name, it has to be good, right? Right! I expected the chili dogs to be tasty but damn, these things were a little too delicious. How delicious? Like go back and order another round delicious. Smothered with chili, raw onions, cheese and mustard, the basic hot dog foundation is transformed into something epically delicious - speedy too!  I can do without the NY attitude and also the public announcement of my credit card being declined, which it wasn't as Amex assured me that Coney's credit card system never even contacted Amex for a charge. But other than that... killer drunk food. Hell, it may even be good sober but I'll probably never find out."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that the meat is actually cat food. the texture of the food we ordered was that of mush and slop. Seriously regret even wasting my breath walking in here. My husband loves hot dogs and chili dogs and all sorts of gross \"fair\" food but even he was grossed out."}
{"text":"Not the best but if you want a good coney dog here you go  Cheese on the dog was pre grated yellow matchsticks, that's one of my downsides. Bun was fresh, dog had a nice snap but was missing something and the chili was good. Stop in and grab a quick dog if you're looking for that fix."}
{"text":"Super small location but that doesn't matter. The hot dogs and fries are great ! Not bad for a place in Fremont."}
{"text":"Got a chili cheese dog.. With mustard cheese and onion... It hit the spot. Love it when I bite into a dog and it cracks!! Customer service was great!!"}
{"text":"It's a 24 hour spot but when you walk in they grunt and moan. I'm so sorry you have to serve us at this hour. I too, work a graveyard shift, and I'm glad too be there, it makes me money. I will never eat at this establishment again. I don't like to go where I'm not welcome."}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs! Came in for a quick meal and it was delicious and a good choice! The staff is friendly and get ur food quick!!! I loved the coney dog, the chili is awesome and the onions get and amazing taste. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Chilli dogs! They make it in front of the window for you as well. It's not that easy finding a really good chili dog and these guys do it pretty damn well. It's located in the Fremont area of downtown Las Vegas. It may cost a bit more than you'd expect but hey you're in tourist area. Be ready to pay to play. The dog size was reasonable. Not too small and not too big. The oozing cheese on the bun and dog. That was topped with chili onions and a little bit of mustard. Such a simple but delicious treat. I would definitely eat this again. I want a chili dog right now.   I've never been to coney island but when I do I'll be eating tons of these.  Recommendation: Chili dog."}
{"text":"Coney's were on point, but chili cheese fries we not right. Real coney island has liquid cheese, not shredded. I'm from the D, so my standards are high for a coney!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped in for a coney whilst checked my out old Vegas. The hot dog itself was good. Had a snap too it when you bit it so probably a natural casing. The Chili was kind of blah. Needed some more work. Just too bland. Definitely could of used more mustard. They use very little. Nice amount of Chile though. Living close to NY and previously eaten the original Coney made the comparison simple. We didn't hate it but we didn't love it either."}
{"text":"Natural casing hot dogs that snap.  A soft bun.  Chili that tastes like its straight from Detroit.  Onions, yellow mustard.  Chili fries with extra chili.  Nothing more to say."}
{"text":"Pretty nice 24 hour hot dog joint on Fremont street, the staff are quick and explained a menu question I had with any hesitation or annoyance.  The place is pretty bare bone as far as looks go (but its clean) but all I care about is food for the most part. The menu is small but from what I had it was pretty good though kinda pricey depending on what you order, I suggest staying with the basics since the more expensive items are really just the same with added condiments. All in all a pretty nice place to visit anytime of the day."}
{"text":"Disappointing. One of the worst hotdogs I've ever had. But it came out fast and the service was good."}
{"text":"I am by no means a hot dog expert  but it was 1am and I had downed a giant daiquiri so I decided a hot dog and some cheese fries would be a fabulous idea. Heartburn, thy name is \"lemonhead daiquiri and coney island cheese fries\"  #poorlifechoices #vegas2am   The place is small and divvy which was fine. I got my stuff to go. The line was out the door but moved super fast.   The employees were friendly, courteous and accommodating considering the length of the line up. My hotdog was just that. A hotdog nothing overly special. It was good for a hot dog. I mean, how does one review a hotdog?     The cheese fries were cheesetacular! The sauce was creamy and thick not all watery and powdered. The fries were fresh and hot and there was a good cheese to fry  ratio.   I'm finding though that cheap food and drink in old Vegas is getting harder and harder to find, these were reasonably priced but not \"cheap\"."}
{"text":"For months after moving out here from Michigan I tried to explain to people \"Hey know of any places in Vegas which are cheap, but really good food wise like a coney island?\"  Most of the time I got blank stares, but now people know what I'm talking about.  A little background, coney islands are everywhere in Michigan.  You go there for breakfast anytime, Greek salads, pie which is kept in a rotating fridge and lost importantly un-healthy, cheap food.  American and Lafayette Coney Island are staples of Detroit and for whatever reason are right next to each other.  Back home I prefer Lafayette (maybe because it's dirtier?) but i was so pumped when I found out The D would be getting one.  What to Expect:  Freshly grilled greasy hot dogs with a famous chili sauce all over the top with onions and mustard.  You'll need wet naps if you expect to eat this with your hands, so grab a fork and knife.  You can expect the food to be cooked to order, yet FAST, one of the best things about a coney island.  To no surprise prices are a bit inflated from what I pay when I go back home to Michigan, but that is expected for something in a tourist stretch.  If you need to satisfy your junk food craving for the month, come here and you won't be disappointed.  Tip:  Not a hot dog fan?  You can get the \"loose\" version, which is ground beef inside of a hot dog bun with the sauce and fixings!"}
{"text":"Chilidogs, sass, and the brightest lights money can buy.   The decision to dine here was definitely influenced by the alcohol gods... \"walk into the light and smell the sweet chili dog filled air.\" The first thing I noticed was the insanely bright lights, going from the dark dim bars into basically a space that's lit like a doctor's office was a bit sobering.   When ordering here make sure you know what you want before stepping up to the register, unless you like fake NY types getting on your case about taking too long or not being able to pay the bill, my friend had to go through this. I ordered a chili dog with chili fries, which is by the way the best decision ever when you have a belly full of booze; food that is salty, greasy and with no health benefits. In fact I ordered another booze sponge coated in chili and onions.   Three stars? - Look it's chili dogs, French fries and few other random things, like Shawarma wraps? None of the food here is overwhelmingly good, it's all strictly utilitarian, it does the job. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon, unless I have more friends who stay in DT and want to party hard and eat bad... well shit.   Crazy Factoid - It's called, \"American Coney Island Chili Dogs\" a Detroit Original? Is there a Coney Island in D-Town?"}
{"text":"I mean I don't know what a Coney Dog is really supposed to taste like but it was cheap and it was ready before we found someplace to sit.  I liked the snap in the Hot Dog but I wasn't used to the Chili so I probably would have opted for just regular condiments.  Tried to come another night but the line was out the door so I decided to pass.  They're open 24 hours so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Hey, it's a Coney Island Chili dog.  It's not gonna be fancy but you know it's legit when they put mustard on it.  And they're open 24hrs..."}
{"text":"The hot dog was ok.  I loved that it was really fast service. On the other hand, I don't understand Detroit, Coney Island, and Hot Dog connection."}
{"text":"Just a great chilli dog place. The hot dogs have a natural casing and eveyrthing seems fresh, even when you're getting a dog at 2 in the morning. The chilli fries are also very good. Only con I would say is lack of a fountain machine, only bottle of soda."}
{"text":"Best hot dog I ever had, I recommend the coney.  This hot dog is better than nathan's, better than Costco dog, better than pink;s..."}
{"text":"Pretty good dogs. Theres always a line but their service is fast. The place is quite small so if it gets crowded good luck finding a table."}
{"text":"basic chilli dogs served super efficiently by a friendly staff. taste is good but i was filled with regret and sodium as soon as i finished my 2nd. really should'nt eat crappy food late at night."}
{"text":"Saturday, July 22, 2017     4:10 PM I was in the area and had a craving for a coney island dog.   We've been coming here a long time.  I ordered a dog with chili and cheese $4.98.   The chili adds flavor but has the consistency of soup, the dog is amazing. I should've ordered a coney island dog with cheese to go, I was in a rush and I ate that messy chili dog with a smile on my face.  I had wet naps in my purse, tee hee."}
{"text":"The American coney island dog place downtown las vegas on fremont st is awesome good bodacious is the word the staff is reality good too they rick"}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit and I love that this place is on Freemont street. The coney's are so good, def one of the better fast food places to eat on freemont street."}
{"text":"Got a yummy chili cheese dog, fries and a soda here when I was staying at the D.  Came as and tasted as expected. After a couple cocktails at the Long Bar, it hit the spot. Staff was nice. Seating area was clean. I'm sure I'll be stumbling back in sometime again soon"}
{"text":"OK it's a hot dog, but damn it's a tasty sum a bitch!! The dog is definitely of good quality, and has a nice snap when you bite into it. The chili is nothing special, but it adds a good element of contrasting flavors to the dog. Throw on some yellow mustard and some fresh raw onion on a nice steamed bun. Overall it's a good dog, not sure about a $4.00 price tag, but after all you are in Vegas baby!!! I miss the $1.25 dogs at Mermaids, but have to admit these are a bit better. So if you're in Vegas, and down on the FSE, and need a dog fix, this will definitely do the trick!!!"}
{"text":"It's virtually impossible to find the classic Detroit coney dog in the west.  Inexplicable.  The American Coney LV location meets the need.  The location and decor is, let's admit it, lacking.  But the dogs are as good as the original and worth the diversion to find."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and the fries were hot and on point But $4.00 for a hot dog??  I thought that was a little much, i mean it certainly didn't taste any different than a ballpark. I guess if the drink was included it would of seemed more justified. Worst part was while walking to the car one casino up i passed a sign that said Jumbo hot dogs with a drink $3.49!! all i could do was laugh!"}
{"text":"ACI may be an institution in Detroit, but it has no such history here in Vegas. I'm not from Detroit/Michigan so I offer my opinion without any hint of nostalgia or homesickness. Yeah, the dog may be better than AM/PM, but at $4 a pop, AM/PM may be a better value. Nice snap, a very mild chili. These dogs are definitely not better than Costco/Sam's, the over the top Pink's, or my favorite Vegas chili dog, Tommy's Famous Hamburgers. I washed down my dogs with a gyro. Good, just like the dogs. But nothing special. Gyro Time is better. If I were a tourist I'm good with ACI. As a local I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. The first time was solid. This time it was not as good as we hoped it would be. Other than the employee that was wiping down the kitchen walls, the rest of the staff literally made it feel like they did not want to be there and it was quite uncomfortable. It also showed in the presentation of and quality of the food. The gyro meat was extremely dry and difficult to eat. We may or may not try this one more time to have a tie breaker...we will see!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm a fan. Yes, the hot dogs are small. BUT they're good. They use lamb skin so it snaps when you bite down on it and the chili is good. For less than $4 on Fremont Street, it's a deal....the chili is included. These tourists need to stop bitching about the price, they're lucky it tasted as good as it did."}
{"text":"You come here for the hot dog with a snap - so delicious and reasonably priced.   Order the original Coney dog with chili. Must stop here when in DT Vegas!"}
{"text":"Coney Island dogs are a little bit overpriced but what you get here is pretty good drunk food while wandering around downtown Vegas.  The chilli coney dogs here were tasty and loved the fact that they have a \"snap\" when you bite into them.  Come here for the dogs and not the gyro because from what I saw, the spinning meatloaf looked like a charred nuclear reactor.    3 stars for the dog."}
{"text":"Visited this place after a late night and it wasn't all that I expected. Their variety of hot dogs is limited. You literally have 1 choice. There are chili burgers, chili fries and regular fries on their menu but small portion sizes. Upon opening the container was a basic looking chili dog with a thin squirt of mustard across the top and onions. If you're just hungry for a lil snack and are not particular about taste then spend your $4 here. If not, save it and go elsewhere....like I should have.   The only pro here is that it is conveniently located next door to the D Hotel facing all the action of Freemont."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that this place had made it to the west. I've seen their food countless times on food network and travel. The service was great and we got our food ridiculously fast (3 American Coney Island Hot Dogs).   The wieners were pretty average here. Good but not that good. I guess I was expecting to be blown away by them. To be honest, I've got Tommy's and Pink's at home to soothe my chili dog cravings. Nonetheless, still a great place to sober up with some greasy goodness. Joint is open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Even with egregious amounts of hops pulsing through my veins, the hot dogs at American Coney Island made my nervous system collapse into a mushroom cloud of misery. You would figure that imbibing barley pops with your buddies would put you in a joyous state of unhindered merriment. We even chatted it up with the lackadaisical guy working the counter. This cashier was personable, possibly stoned, and supportive of our decent into an alcohol induced haze.   And then the coney dog rolls out of the factory window, dressed to the gills in chili and defeat. Two bites into this throng of sodium and I'm lolling in despair. The chili tastes like it was purchased in the can aisle of a 99 cents store. And the hot dog is in a sad state of quality and flavor. With Mermaids down the street offering Nathan's franks, there's really no reason to roll the dice at American Coney Island. White flag raised."}
{"text":"I could not tell you how many times I have walked by this \"gem\" and never stopped in. Well. I finally did because I noticed I had a 2 for1 in my las vegas advisor 2018 coupon book. I got two of the best chili cheese dogs I have ever eaten. Bar none! The dogs had that snap to them. The chili was flavorful.  Good cheese and fresh onions. That's it. I'm going in everytime I walk by from now on."}
{"text":"Had a chili dog.  Taste was great but for $4 not a great value.  Service was good and the place is clean.  Marginal recommendation"}
{"text":"I and family were sooo disappointed  Worst hot dog ever! Taste like a boiled hot dog. .staff very rude! ! Don't bother, a waste of your money"}
{"text":"Great hotdog place!  I ordered 2 dogs and chili fries.  Just like in Detroit, they put their chili, raw onions and mustard.  The dogs had AMAZING snap to it.  The buns were steamed so they were soft.  The chili was delictable and not too salty.  It was heaven.  I ate the 2 dawgs, ate a bit of the chili fries, threw that away and ordered another dawg.  I highly recommend.  It's the way a hot dog should be prepared."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I really like their chili cheese fries they're delicious. The place looks nice and clean and when it's packed the line always moves pretty fast. The only thing is that the staff is not as friendly they just take your order and that's it they don't greet you or anything which I don't have a problem with it but that's why I gave them 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"I don't understand what the big deal is!  Well let's see Chili dog with extra onions!  First of all!  I can understand that chili .75 cents!  But your really charging .75 cents for extra onions?  Are you serious right now?  This hot dog, didn't taste any better than Wienerschnitzel!  So lets see the difference in price  Coney Island 2 chili dogs with extra onions $9.50  Wienerschnitzel 2 chili dogs extra onions 2 for $3.00.......So I can also get 4 chili dogs with extra onions, 2 fries and 2 sodas for under $10.00!     I saw it, and had to try it!  I won't be back!  Not worth the money! ."}
{"text":"This is Detroit style Chili Dogs. They use a nice snap dog and a seeded bun. There chili is like paste. The employees were funny and very suggestive. The location is rough for Las Vegas locals. Tourists should love this late night Chili Dog Palace."}
{"text":"Give the awesome chick with the wild hair a raise! I love the dogs! Great food and great service.. fits in well at the D Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for a hot dog. The dog was OK. The chili fries left a lot to be desired. Place was very clean and the employees were nice."}
{"text":"Pretty ordinary place. It kind of looks like a small tiny version of Johnny Rockets. It's a great little place to grab a hot dog or chili.   The service was pretty swift and the people there were friendly but this place was lacking. Don't get me wrong, my chili dog was delicious but the place needed a little cleaning, this olace just didnt feel clean and it wasn't even crowded."}
{"text":"Update: I went two nights on a row. I really like the chili. It goes great with the onion and a beer   From what I remember this was a fun spot to get a late night snack. It's right on Fremont st and is always busy. Not the greatest dog or the worst. Chili is like paste. Get as chili dog and some fries and look at your receipts in the morning."}
{"text":"Detroit, Michigan oh how I missed you...Haven't been to Detroit, Michigan since about 2008. Detroit is well known for their coney islands and boy do they live up to the hype. In Detroit their is like a coney islands on every single corner. Literally saw a coney island across the street from a coney island on 8 mile in detroit.   Now here I am living on the west coast and have been wanting to fly back to Detroit just to get some Coney Islands. What do you know...I stumble into the D hotel casino in las vegas and find a Coney Island....At first I just couldn't believe it was true.  Sure it says Coney Island in name but does it taste like Detroit coney islands  The answer is YES......YES.......YES!!! YES.....YES.....YES!!!!! *In my best Daniel Bryan voice.   One of the best hotdogs I ever had. The chilli cheese fries are also on point! I come back to Vegas in about 3 weeks so first thing I'm buying when I land is some coney islands....no doubt about it lol  WOO WOO WOO YOU KNOW IT!!! *Zack Ryder voice"}
{"text":"I don't think the chili is all that, it may be just my preference, because in my opinion it should be thick, chunky, and tasteful. The hit dog was wrinkled from sitting a while on the grill. The employees were very nice, friendly and efficient. This is why it deserves  3 ***."}
{"text":"This is a small place on Fremont Street inside the \"D\" (formerly Fitzgerald's). We were in the mood for chili dogs so my sister suggested this place.  After a long day, it sounded like a great idea. The staff was fast, and friendly which was nice. The dogs all had a  nice snap which was nice for a change. The Chili was good as well. They did forget to take the mustard off a few dogs and didn't add cheese to another, but we weren't charged for it, so no worries.   The fries were piping hot as well. It's a small location so to go may be a better choice if you have a large party.    If you like hot dogs and don't want to spend a ton, this is a great place to try."}
{"text":"Excellent food and pleasant staff! This is the only real sit down place to eat on Fremont Street that was not really associated with a casino. Hotdogs were excellent Gyros was one of the best I ever had, and fries were perfect. Place was spotless and had a somewhat celebrity decor. My son got a hot dog that had mustard on it by mistake and they gladly gave us a new one and let my others guys polish off the mistake. Def would go there again!"}
{"text":"Dont eat the hot dogs they taste like plastic toy dogs. But the gyros and the chili cheese fries are amazing. Hot dogs hell no i went and bought 18 dogs and nobody finished them all lol."}
{"text":"Detroit Institution in Sin City. Coney and Loose burgers are done exactly as they are in the \"D\". Phenomenal snacking after drinking on the old strip.....especially the chili cheese fries!"}
{"text":"Packed on a Saturday night, had to try a Coney Island Chili Dog. It was really tasty but the wife thought it was nothing special compared to the inexpensive hot dogs you get a other places. I got the regular chili dog with onions and mustard. Not used to putting mustard on a chili dog but I gotta say it was really good. The difference in the hot dog is the casing of the meat. It really does snap and you get that familiar back East type hot dog].  We had to wait for about 20 minutes to get a table and there was a constant line but the line did go pretty fast. Place was pretty clean considering how many people were moving through this place. In the 40 minutes or so that we were there: ordering, eating and then cleaning up, I noticed that customers were shoving trash into the overfilled trash receptacles. As I was walking out I asked an employee that had opened the door to the kitchen if he could get someone to empty them and he said \"man, I'm just trying to get out of here!\" Nice.  I saw that they had Gyros and other items. Will have to come back for more of the menu."}
{"text":"In need of chili dog after losing $100 at the black jack table? Get in line with the rest of the inebriated people and order yourself a couple chili dogs and some hot fries. Located in old downtown Vegas. Fremont street. This is the Taco Bell of hot dogs. Everything tastes better after a shameless night of drinking and gambling!  Acid reflux be damn!"}
{"text":"My home away from home... I was pretty excited to get a Coney here because after being away from Michigan for so many years, I really miss the old favorites. At least home was a little bit closer when I came here. I just wish there was more on the menu, but oh well. The place could also use a makeover.  I should note, if you do make your way out to Michigan, please try a real Coney Island restaurant. This place really doesn't live up to the name except for the hotdogs and gyros."}
{"text":"Good food fast! Must hit place when your on Fremont drinking and don't wanna go broke to fill your tummy!!"}
{"text":"This place is open 24/7. When you're drinking what a better way to end your night, ha. Even though the staff deals with a lot of drunk idiots they were still friendly and accommodating. We ordered a coney dog, coney dog without chili, coney dog without onions, and a gyro with chili. Staff was fantastic and the coney dogs are awesome."}
{"text":"I am an American loyalist from Detroit.  The coney dogs and chili fries are identical to the ones back home, right down to the way the casings snap when you bite into them.  For that, five stars.  However, this location does not have Vernors which is a big downer.  So four it is."}
{"text":"Serviceable food, comparable to a decent \"roach coach\". Hot dogs are pretty good (better than Pink's on the Strip though) but not bun length, chili was o.k. but lacks in comparison to Original Tommy's and even Stagg's canned chili. The fries were bog standard for a diner so nothing overly special. Overall decent food at a reasonable price but nothing to write home about or go out of your way for."}
{"text":"This place was GARBAGE!! I spent $13 on 2 small ass tasteless chili cheese dogs and fries!! The hot dogs was under cooked the chili barely warm and absolutely bland. The hot dog was the cheapest of meats who knows what mess I was eating!! Ughhhhh I was shocked that I spent money on something I felt like was worth a total of $3!! I can't imagine how anyone loves this place and dirty atmosphere w trash over flowing. I didn't even want to give it one star but I had to just to leave the review. Highly not recommended!!!"}
{"text":"The dogs are petite.  I'm from West Michigan and if u served tiny dogs like that u would not last long."}
{"text":"So I'm such a huge fan of Coney Island hot dogs that I had to stop and taste vegas version. I got a coney dog with no mustard and no onions. The staff is great it's attach to a hotel and at the end of Fremont street. I would come back to this location again"}
{"text":"First time here on Fremont Street. Don't let the small size of the spot fool you, their menu is large and the flavor is too! I got chili cheese fries and a hot dog. It was so tasty! The prices and portions were reasonable. The staff was really fun and pleasant with the customers. They served us quickly and we went through the line rather fast. If you're craving chili or a hot dog, visit this spot."}
{"text":"I was wandering around Fremont Street on my first morning in Vegas and I happened upon this fast-food joint. Who can say no to a chili dog? Not I, that's for sure.  I ordered the Coney Island Dog, which comes topped with chili, cheese, and onions. The first thing I noticed was the impressive snap of the hot dog itself. (This is sadly not a feature that one finds with hot dogs in Canada.) The three toppings all worked beautifully with the dog and although I scarfed it down in record time, I really enjoyed the heck out of this dish."}
{"text":"This is an okay place. I've had way better hot dogs before. The hot dog itself was a joke (so thin and small). I specifically said no mustard and yet they still put it on there which ruined the taste for me. The main thing I enjoyed were the French fries."}
{"text":"I've never been to New York, so I don't have anything to compare it to. But honestly, I've had plenty of other hot dogs and these ones taste just like those. LOL! I think what makes it special is that it's located on crazy Fremont Street & I don't know about others, but I always feel just a little bit like doing something out of my comfort zone when I walk around here. Like for me, getting hot dogs from a restaurant when they're easy & way cheaper to make at home is completely unlike me.  But why be sensible??!!!  You're in Downtown LV, people!!!  So, go for it!!  And while you're at it, slap some chili on those hot dogs!!!!  My guys pushed it to the max...they cheesed up theirs!!!  Woot!!  We are edgy!!!!  :-D  LOL!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the spot downtown where you come to get your belly full of chili dogs. The franks served aren't those soulless meat tubes you find at the grocery store for a buck a pack. These hot dogs are cooked on a flat top grill giving it a little char and the casing has a slight snap to it.   I get a Coney without... (Chili, mustard, no onions), fork and extra napkins.  Open late!"}
{"text":"One star is for the convenience of being in Fremont Street. People defending this place obviously are paid or begging to ignore the terrible service and food. First of all The chili dog will cost you 5 dollars. ITS A HOT DOG! Thinking it would at the very least be a quick bite and a tasty chili. NOPE!  Mine was apparently already made?! It was not placed but tossed to me. My friend looked at the guy like \"No thank you\" They were upset that we were even there? Outside there was a guy selling dogs for half the price and a bigger size. I dont understand these people they hire. I know its a Hot Dog stand however, I expect to be treated with some respect if Im paying  for a simple hot dog. I wanna cheat on my meal. I want to feel satisfied. I felt cheated, and as a local I remembered why I dont eat at these gimmick places. To say Costco sells A HOT DOG AT 1.50. THIS IS ABOUT 1/3 THAT SIZE. Cold dog. warm chili. Made like someone never made a chili dog before? American Coney Island. Take me there! Treat me like I matter. Because I am almost certain this won't very soon. Terrible Place"}
{"text":"This is a great little expeience if you are looking for something to eat that is fast and simple. The fact that it has been around for over 90 years is interesting, as is the fact the it is in The D casino and started in DEtroit."}
{"text":"Returned on 4/16/2018. Friendly staff. Quick service and the coney island hot dogs are the best you'll find around  I will return the next time I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"If you're on Fremont come check this place out. It's right outside the D. You can actually access it from the street side or inside the D. The dogs have a great snap. The chili they use is amazing. Make sure to get the chili cheese fries. Heavenly!"}
{"text":"Easy spot in the D Casino/Hotel to grab a hot dog and some chili cheese fries.. nothing wrong with any of that but the hot dogs are something like $8 each. Pretty high prices for that kind of situation. I don't say I wouldn't go there again, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Place has good food don't get me wrong. I ordered chili, coney hot dog and chili cheese fries. Fries were good, chili was a little to runny for me personally and I didn't like the texture of the hot dog- it kinda taste like they boiled it which to me isn't all that great. Fries were my favorite. I would come back for those."}
{"text":"The D is the collection of some of Detroits best places.  American coney is no exception.  Derek Stevens, the owner and operator of The D, knew exactly what he was doing by putting in this place in his casino.  Your hungry, probably drinking and just need something that hits the spot.  Growing up in The D, I spent quite a few late nights ending at American or layette Coney Island,  so for me this place is perfect.  From the great pictures on the walls to the food.  It just feels like home and I tend to wind up here at some point during my trip."}
{"text":"Being a born Michigander coney's are in my blood. Came here on a Friday night while in town and yes they were quite busy but you get your food fast. Everything is ready to go and served in Styrofoam containers. Watch out you will burn your tongue!!!!  I had the loose burger and hubby the hot hogs. Cheese fries had my heart but from what I remember the cheese was very orange, weird. Prices are Vegas prices.....Downtown Detroit the pricing is not that steep! The guy behind the counter.....now he was cool, good attitude and did his job well!"}
{"text":"Take it from a local, don't walk by this place without getting a loose burger. Or 5 of them. Or one one of the best gyros ever."}
{"text":"Only spot open 24/7 great late nite food....so good! Service fast quick and easy, Enjoyed the chili cheese fries...YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Omg. This place is boss when it comes to chili cheese dogs and chili cheese fries. Order chili cheese dog and fries, went walking around for a bit then had to go back for seconds. Amazing... would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Oooo, yea I'm an instant fan.  This does not replace MERMAID's because that was definitely the it late night or ANYTIME spot for a hot dog BUT american Coney Island comes very close to it.  Very good quality, and the SNAP...yes it the dog does snap when you bite into it then you could've just went to WINCO and grabbed a pack of Oscar Myer, they're on sale right now for $1.88.  Anyway, we went a little after midnight it was crowded but the wait was not long at all.  I went very basic, mustard and ketchup w/ a side of fries. D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S  I know it's just a Hot Dog, but it's a damn good Hot Dog.  The inside is not very big, seating is kind of limited but a cool place to try"}
{"text":"I for one was super excited when Coney Island opened in Las Vegas, being that I am from Detroit and often miss some of the great food my hometown has to offer and trust me American Coney Island does not disappoint. The coney dogs are awesome, exactly how i remember them, and the chilli is best you will ever find. The thing I wasn't too thrilled about was the cheese they use on the chilli cheese fries, some people might like it but it wasn't my cup of tea. I'm really hoping in the future they will also bring in Detroit favorites chicken pita and corn beef sandwiches. If you are looking for a hot dog or just wants a taste of old fashioned Detroit American Coney Island is the place."}
{"text":"$4.00 for a Chili dog is too much. Especially when the Chili is OK and the dog doesn't even snap in your mouth. Disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the newer additions to the D in Las Vegas. I would not say best hot dogs around. But the connivence of them being open 24 hours and semi reasonably priced. Drinks have free refills as well."}
{"text":"Made a special trip down here to get a Coney Dog.  I was a little disappointed with the food.  The chili dog with nothing special.  Sprinkled with cheese that was not melted. Also were a little stingy with the chili and onions. If your looking for a quality Coney Chili dog, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"The best and tastes just like Detroit.  Would have loved it even if I'd never had the original.  Only had the chili dog with mustard and onions, but had to have a second to continue the savory taste.  Staff was friendly and helpful and would go back in a heartbeat if I wasn't going home"}
{"text":"Located inside the newly redone and renamed D on the Fremont Street Experience. This is an import from Detroit that did not need a government bailout. It is certainly too delicious to fail. The dogs are a Dearborn sausage, that has a wicked snap, and the chili is fantastic. Worth the trip downtown! I say give it a whirl. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Pricey! And they are stingy with the fries. I definitely expected more food or at least a bigger hotdog/more fries for the amount of money they charged. Food was good, but don't come here if you're famished. No military discount FYI."}
{"text":"Is it the best chili dog I have ever had? Yep.  The wife and I had just seen the Food Network special on Chili Dogs which happened to show the rivalry between American Coney Island Chili Dogs and Lafayette (the rivalry is real, as evidenced by all the pictures you can find inside of this small chili dog shop). While walking down Fremont Street I spotted this gem sticking out from the D casino. I thought it was too good to be true so I whipped out my trusty Yelp app and it was true!  The wife and I were super excited to see what all the hoopla was about, but knew that should wait until the time was right to have one of these bad boys. Well the time finally came the night before we were going to leave Vegas, and I was bummed... I should of had one before this time. They were delicious!  I ordered an original dog which includes: a soft steamed bun, a grilled weiner (with the most perfect snap on it), chili, mustard and onions. That's it, super simple, yet super good! There is not much more to it. If you like chili dogs, you have to try American Coney Island! This will change your mind of your favorite chili dog, and give you a new number one!"}
{"text":"So with the signs everywhere in the hotel for this place you would think has to be good. Such not the case it is awful! The dog was so tough like rubber with a Luke warm slop on top... now I know when your intoxicated things tend to go down a lot easier and not even that steered me away from thinking this is disgusting. Would not try again!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 regular coney's with cheese. The 3 stars are for the customer service only.   Customer service: We were greeted as we walked in, and their was only one other customer being serviced. The cashier was nice and took my order promptly and accurately. My food was finished just as fast as i placed my change in my bag.   The coney: It was blah. I don't care for the weiner or the chilli, but the cheddar was good. Since I don't feel like getting something else I'm eating it. Not too happy but it will do.   Will I go back... nope"}
{"text":"As far as chili dogs go, they aint half bad from this place. Don't expect anything resembling fine dining, but if it is a classic American dog you're looking for, with a few different options for dressing, then this is your jam."}
{"text":"LOVE this place LOL Last trip to Vegas, we ate here EVERY day  Wish we had more Hot Dog Stands like this in life!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious meal and not wanting to spend a lot of money, this is where you come.  The chili cheese dog with cheese fries is my go to and it never disappoints. The location is great and the staff is always super friendly and you get your food within a couple minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"I can honestly say the chili dogs and gyros are pretty good.... But I would I make a trip downtown and deal with the parking and all that to only come here?..... Prob not... I would however stop in if I'm downtown..... On a side note.   The place is very clean and the food was ready quickly. Big pluses in my book."}
{"text":"Reminds me of coneys from the Detroit area - thank you!!!! Only thing missing is the Lafayette Coney across the street :) Staff was super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Alright, so HONESTLY.... The Coney Island hot dog really does have a \"plastic\" texture when you bite into it (probably the casing), & reallyyyy ain't all that great, BUT! Chili, cheese, onions, mustard, ketchup, & hot dogs at 1am while needing a quick bite to eat & sober up? This hit the spot!    American Coney Island Hot Dog is located on the Freemont Experience at The D Casino (bottom level). It's open 24 hours, so for all you late night gamblers needing a cheap place to lightly recover from the heartache that came from losing your *beep* off at the Casino's.. Or all you late night, post clubbing/bar hopping drunk arses (keeping it PG for Yelp here, but you get the picture); Grab some sloppy, semi cheap (unless you get a drink & fries as well; total will be $8) coney dogs from ACIHD! The customer service was rather well & made up for the 2 star hot dog!  P.S. I've always wanted to try Coney Hotdogs thanks to the Travel Channel, but have not had one until TONITE.. But sadly.. I am 100% sure this is a complete let down compared to the real deal coney's up state! Just wanted to throw that out there for those that have tried real coney hot dog's and find themselves shaking their head and judging my review right now lol"}
{"text":"The chilli dog was not that good. The outside of the hotdog was hard and the bread tasted stale. Idk how this place is even in business. The prices were low though so there is that."}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit... Like really from Detroit... Not Metro Detroit. I know real coney, anddddd it's close enough.   If you're desperate it works, but nothing's like home.   Of course it's pricey. In Detroit, a coney is half the price but you are in Vegas, so what do you expect"}
{"text":"We came here with a coupon for a \"Buy a Coney, Get one Free\" coupon.  Coney's run about $3.99.  They had an American Coney, with a couple spoons of hamburger over your coney for $4.99.  I asked if I could order two Americans and pay the upcharge on both (the extra $2).  The cashier said no problem, but the manager jumped in, almost screaming, saying \"only the coneys, only the coneys.\"  I told him I was willing to pay the extra $1 on each coney, but he only shouted back, \"only the coney.\"  Hmm...you sell a coney for $3.99 but you're willing to take and extra $1 for a couple spoons of hamburger...BUT...with a coupon you don't want the extra $2 for a few extra spoons of hamburger?  Doesn't make sense to me.  It seemed like the manager wanted to feel important in his job and impress everyone by making a \"HUGE\" decision not to make the company an extra $2.  Pretty idiotic in my book.  Btw...the coneys were ok, not great, not bad."}
{"text":"There is something wonderful about the pop of the Coney dog and the gooey goodness of their chilli that had me going back twice in 24 hours. Their food is greasy and fattening and perfect after spending the day drinking...which I'm sure is the point. For sure worth a stop if you're into messy grub."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite to eat if you are in old Vegas or even in The D. The gyro was good but nothing to rave about. Wish they had chicken gyros but only meat. Staff was very friendly and nice. My favorite was the cheese fries. The cheese wiz was amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great price for a tasty fast food snack right on Fremont street in the D hotel.   Friendly folks behind the counter, and you cannot go wrong with the chili dog."}
{"text":"It's good. The chili is good, the hotdogs are good the fries are good. It's all just good. Sweet service too. The guys taking my order and making my food were just great. Definitely will hit this spot again. I work nearby and love a good hot dog!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for what it is... a hot dog. Average chili, and a regular bun. These dogs would run you under $2 on a NY street cart and would be 100x's better.   Good drunk food while walking around downtown and open 24 hours. Probably last time I'll go unless I'm desperate and craving an overpriced hot dog."}
{"text":"A little Detroit in Vegas.  As a native Detroiter living in CA I make sure I hit up ACI every time I head out to Vegas.   Everyone is really friendly and the coneys, loose meats, and gyros are on spot!  Met the owners a couple times and they are great!  I saw a few negative reviews and was pretty surprised.  I've been 20+ times and always had a stellar experience."}
{"text":"Really. 5 bucks for a standard chili cheese dog. The servers are nice but the food is way over priced"}
{"text":"Not bad for being an affordable food place in downtown Vegas. Their chilli cheese fries were pretty good to say the least."}
{"text":"Love the chili dogs!! Even better... this place is open 24hrs. I'd eat 10 if everyone wasn't so judgemental"}
{"text":"American Special is the best hot dog in Vegas!  I love the coney dog, but the American special is sooooo good, my mouth is watering just writing about it right now;)  It is a hot dog with chili, onions, cheese, mustard, and.....loose beef!  Such an awesome combination, and so soft in your mouth, it is like a pillow of meat:)  I also enjoyed the coney dog with extra cheese, onions, and chili along with a side of chili cheese fries.  No need for ketchup, also because they didn't have any.  So if you are at the Fremont Street Experience in the D Hotel, then make a stop at this 24 hour location where anytime is a good time for a hot dog!"}
{"text":"They are good for what this place is...an American coney shop.  My only complaint is that I would like more salt in the chili...seems suspiciously under-salted.  I ordered a coney and chili cheese fries.  Both were really good...once salted :)  Staying at The D, so this is so convenient...back entrance is still w/in The D entrance on Fremont.  I would patronize again."}
{"text":"I got the Coney Dog and Chili Cheese Fries. The chili cheese fries were $4.10 an were okay. The Coney Dog was $3.85 and was ok. Nothing special.   The service was amazing. Young men were working last night and they were really nice and smiled and even asked about our night and had a sense of humor. They were fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Great food to prevent my hangover, chili cheese fries were amazing.  And the staff was hilarious and friendly. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Love this place! Hot dogs are insane , love the snap of the casing, also chili, mustard and onion combination is on point! We also had the chili cheese fries, made with a generous portion of fresh shredded cheese and chili. My husband and I like a trip to Fremont street from our vacation time on the strip just to stop by this place"}
{"text":"Line is always long, but quick after you order. The food is ok. The chili is ok, nothing special. It's better after you've been drinking all day."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst food I've had in my life.  Hot dogs and chili are absolutely gross. I would starve before ever eating here again. The D needs another option for late night food. When I have to leave the casino I'm staying in to find a decent place to eat, that's not a good thing for the casino  You best believe I'm going to gamble at the other casino when I finish eating."}
{"text":"Hotdog would be a 4 [once they got the order right], but since that took sometime for that we will give it a 2 Chili cheese fries, it it was melted cheese would've been a 5, but it's like shredded cheese that wasn't melted enough--3 Ordering-1  So after a morning of watching football and gambling on a Sunday we wanted drunk food.  So we decided on this place over McDonalds b/c I had seen in it on the news.  Walking in, it's way too bright, there's just stuff everywhere and it's just too much [see the pix it hurts your eyes and I love the American Flag but this is not tastefully done] After waiting about 5 mins b/c they had issues w/ the lady ordering in front of me it was finally my turn to experience the debacle [she even looked over at me rolled her eyes and wished me good luck].  Have you ever heard the expression \"too many cooks in the kitchen\", that's what happens here. There were 5 people behind the counter all bumping into each other, talking over each other, and not getting the job done.  They need more training. Plain and simple.  I had to order my order w/ the cash register guy 4 times before he repeated it, then the guy making the hotdogs still got it wrong. So, I had to look over the counter, coax him in the right direction, and get my dog right!!!!   My suggestion here: make a condiment bar.  That way people can put what they want on it, you don't have to do it behind the counter, nor worry about it, and the process would go much smoother.  They also don't have sauerkraut :(  that made me sad. I love a good kraut dog.  Chili was actually very good and the dog was great, crisp on the outside and perfect on the inside.  The other issue:  they put shredded cheese on the chili cheese fries and it doesn't melt enough when you are trying to eat it. So cheese strings fall all over the place.  Also, there's not ketchup on the tables????  So I had to go back up ask for extra ketchup and they squeezed it into the top of my hotdog container, my guess is b/c they were running out of bottles of ketchup???  They didn't even have containers to put the ketchup in [again condiment bar....like Roberto's Tacos does would be awesome].  So place needs work, hopefully they make it happen.  2 hotdogs and a order of chili cheese fries just shy of $13"}
{"text":"My opinion of this venue is based on price and food quality.  I come from Hawaii--land of the overpriced everything, and I didn't think it could get worse. I was wrong.  The hot dogs here are the smallest dogs I've ever seen sold at a restaurant venue. It's absolutely nothing special. Chili, mustard, onions... and a skin that you sort of snap through as you bite it. What am I paying $3+ for? The skin? The chili wasn't anything special either, tasted like libby's canned chili. I truly don't understand what people are so smitten about.  (My dad always said people on the mainland are used to food with no taste, that our taste buds are different or something. Never really got how that could be true but I'm starting to consider it now.)  I happened to watch that TV show that featured the flagship venue in competition with it's sister venue. They made everything look amazing. That tiny tasteless dog I got here did not live up to the hype of that show.   I really think the dogs are at least a dollar overpriced. Perhaps it's because it's Vegas and everything's either smaller or overpriced... I don't know. I feel like that's what people say about Hawaii: that it's just Hawaii and everything is overpriced but... Geez Louise, at least a $1.50 hot dog and drink combo from Costco is somehow far more tasteful.  At an average every-day hot dog stand at my college campus, I can get a jumbo dog (about 2.5 times bigger) with the works for the same price. I wanted to give two stars but my dissatisfaction with the value outweighs anything else for me."}
{"text":"Skip the Coney. It's awful bland for a mess.   Get the gyros. I didn't understand what they were doing with this simple sandwich the first time I had it. Then I went to Detroit, and Greektown, and Plaka's.  Now I get it. And its simplicity is a thing of beauty. Tomato, onion, meat, pita, tzatziki. But all the elements work together perfectly. The chewiness of the pita, warmed on the grill. The mild smoothness of the meat. The bite of the white onions. The sweetness of the tomatoes. And the creamy tzatziki tying it all together.   At less than $7 with tax, this is one of the cheaper gyros sandwiches in town. Bonus."}
{"text":"I miss the Detroit area a lot so when I was downtown and stumbled upon the poster advertisement at the \"D\" I ran over.  It was just about how I remembered it from home (tasted great) but twice the price.  The staff was really nice.  So  its cheaper than flying into Detroit just for a chili-dog but really there isn't any reason to charge that much.  There are a couple of other places in town that serve similar (Great Links) but the pricing is about the same.  I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Cool hotdog spot on the Freemont street experience. Had the Great American and the Chili dog. Novelty spot  Price is right."}
{"text":"Last Saturday night was pretty hazy but somehow our group ended up here.  Next thing I know, I have a Coney Dog handed to me.  I saw cheese, onions and chili on a hot dog and it was devoured in less than 30 seconds.  I had some chili land on my sneaker as a parting gift although I am not sure it came from my dog.    25 seconds didn't fully allow me to take the time and analyze the complex flavors of this \"world famous\" hot dog.  But considering my state at the time, if I had really liked it, I definitely would've gotten another one.  I am not a big hot dog person.  It would be my last choice of food at any sporting event or bbq.  I'll reserve Hofman's hot dogs of Syracuse, NY as the best one I've ever had and this was average.  Not many other hot dog options on Fremont but I'd rather do Mermaids for their atmosphere :P"}
{"text":"The other reviews have pretty well covered this small restaurant right off the D Casino on Fremont Street. After playing some slots and keno, was too lazy to venture off and explore additional food options. So, Coney Island it was since I didn't want McDonalds.   When I ordered around 11pm on a Sunday night was not busy but filled up while I was eating. Ordered the Gyro. The nice part was it only took about 2 minutes to make, then DING it was ready. Unfortunately, it left alot to be desired. The pita was very dry, likely from earlier in the week...like last Monday. The gyro meat was dry and had decent flavor, surprisingly.  Wouldn't order again.  I wasn't expecting amazing food, but my gyro didn't hit the spot. Maybe their chili dogs are better. But would likely have to take a double dose of Zantac."}
{"text":"I grew up in Michigan, I am no stranger to Coney Island restaurants and this one did not disappoint.  We ordered coney dogs, chili cheese fries, a gyro and diet cokes. I was instantly transported back to MI and nostalgia took over. This place is a must on my vegas to do list.   10/10 mandatory for any Michigander looking to relive some great memories!"}
{"text":"Being from around Detroit I can never get enough of these hot dogs!!  They are amazing!!  It's like being home again.  I will never come to Las Vegas without coming here to eat one of these, or two or three!!!  Love how it's in old vegas and they taste the same as they do back home!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night while I was on Freemont Street.  I walked past it and since it reminded me of places back east decided I should try it. I was not disappointed. I have grown up going to places in PA that sold hotdogs that are cooked on the griddle and topped with chili and onions and was excited to see these were cooked the same way.  I walked into the place and was greeted with a very clean and tidy place which was nice.  It wasn't much for decor which is fine. Hotdog places don't need to be fancy they just have to be good. Their menu is super simple which is a reflection of what they do well. I ordered the coney dog (without mustard) and fries. It was super fast by the time I had paid, my order was already up and waiting for me.   I took it to the table and opened the styrofoam boxes and was pleasantly surprised. The hotdog was covered with chili and onions and was griddles to perfection. The fries were golden and inviting. I first had to try a fry in the chili. It was good, the fry crispy and not too greasy and the chili not too spicy. The hotdog with everything on it had good flavor. It reminded me of the ones back east, not a perfect replica but definitely close. It was juicy and flavorful and the bun wasn't soggy. The fries were crispy and crunchy without the overly  greasy flavor you might expect from fries out of the bag.  For a simple hotdog place that offers a few other options it was a good place to hit up when you get hungry. If you want something fast tasty and not pretentious this is your place. The food is fast and flavorful and the service friendly and accommodating"}
{"text":"The hot dog itself has a nice snap yes!! I love all beef chili which this is. Nice soft bun. Super friendly service, quick too.  Like this place but then I also like der weinerschnitzel!!"}
{"text":"I had to stop in while I was in downtown LV and I'm glad I did. As a certified Coney island aficionado, I wanted to see if some of the reviews that slammed this American Coney Island in the D casino were justified and fair. I must say I was pleasantly surprised to find that both the standard Coney and my all-time favorite, the \"loose\" Coney burger were both authentic Detroit quality and flavor. The chili and the hot dog were just as you expect to get in Detroit. The hot dog bun wasn't steamed but I've eaten at many Coney islands in and around Detroit that were not either.  I would give this review a 4 star if not for the almost double the price of both items I had. $3.85 Coney / $4.35 loose burger.  Based on prices for other comparable eats you find in LV it's acceptable I suppose. Coney lovers. You Will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Eh, it's alright. Tried the original, chili was too peppery.  However, super nice staff, even at 3am in Downtown Vegas, awesome attitude. Still happy I tried. Been there, done that..."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast because they are open 24 hours.   We were staying at the D Las Vegas and that Hot dog guy is advertised all over the casino and it caught my daughter's attention when we were inside the elevator. She said daddy look hot dogs yum and let's go there and eat.  So we woke up early the next morning and ordered a chili cheese fries, Coney, all American and a large orange soda. The order was served up really quick and the staff are friendly and helpful. Love the \"snap\" of the hot dogs when you bite into them. The chili and cheese and mustard and onions were delicious along with the hot dog.  They have a pretty roomy dining area and lots of memorabilia throughout the restaurant.  It was a pretty tasty chili cheese dog. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"In LOVE with this place!!! The coney is AMAZING, the loose meat sandwich is AWEOME, the service was just like in Detroit (fast and efficient!!!),  Will definitely have a coney every time I come home to Vegas. Love Love Love!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst hot dog on Fremont Street. You can go to multiple places and get a better dog for less money. Everyone in our group was totally disappointed."}
{"text":"I love chili cheese dogs!! Especially with onions and mustard, mmmm mmm mmmm!!!  And if you are like me and have been drinking, walking around Fremont all night and need a quick bite, this is the place. I enjoy my hot dog and I'm ready to conquer my next drink!   They also serve fries, gyros( I've tried before and they are good), and burgers. Although, they told me they don't carry mayo the last time I was there. So, if you like burgers with that condiment than you are out of luck.   It's a go to stop for me and can't wait for my dog fix next time!"}
{"text":"The reason i gave 1 star is because the gyro was a joke.  No meat on the sandwich at all.  And YES im from detroit.  I ate at coney islands since i was born.  The loose and coney are great from here.  However, 1 star was for the guy with the attitude when i asked him where the meat was? His reply \"i been here for a while and this is how it is\".  Great customer service when ur paying $10 for a gyro. Finally they started putting cheese on their chili fries. $48 for 3 gyros 2 cokes and 1 loose burger? Look the pic"}
{"text":"Nothing special...James Coney Island is still my fave...or pinks...nothing special for a $4 hotdog. However the employees are very cool. Very Fast service."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a lifelong resident of Detroit 38yrs born and raised and American Coney Island (Detroit) is my favorite coneys island period. I'm not one of those suburbanites that eats Coneys only when I'm in town for a wings or tigers game so with that being said the American Coney Island in Vegas is horrible compared to the Detroit location, it'll do if your from Detroit and you've relocated to Las Vegas and you need a fix, but if you're from Detroit and just visiting just wait til you get back home. I mentioned this to the workers in the Detroit location and they said their self \"everyone that visits the Vegas location says the same thing\"  1. Buns weren't steamed 2. Gyros were skimpy compared to Detroit  3. Chili was too thick   Just a few of the differences I noticed, The workers here need to take a trip to Detroit and learn how it's really done"}
{"text":"After sampling tasty Bison Tri-Tip at the World Food Championships along Fremont Street, I stepped in here for lunch.  The staff was friendly as always, and service was very quick.  This time I downed an excellent Coney Dog with a noticeable snap, including overflowing Chili, White Onions, and Mild Yellow Mustard on a nice soft bun.  No Ketchup was needed!  Unsalted French Fries were good, but some spud tips had darkened skin showing that would have been better clipped off.  One dog was not enough.  So, I had two--at $4.05 apiece, including tax!  No mess this time, except for some Chili on my fingers.  RATINGS FOR THIS EXPERIENCE:    The Coney Dog -- 5 stars! American Coney Island overall -- 4 stars  I will most assuredly be back to The D for more hot dog heaven!"}
{"text":"For a Hotdog restaurant tucked into a casino I was pleasantly surprised.   Great snap on the dog. Chili was kinda bland for my taste buds but was good texture/ consistency for a dog.   The Fiancé tried the Gyro and loved the amount of sauce they used. I even had to ask if she ordered extra but no it was a normal serving.   The employees seemed angry and not your open customer service how can I help you type. It was very reminiscent of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld and it made me laugh.  I'm sure thats not normal and we didn't take offense but deserved a mention as someone might not be ready for a \"NO DOG FOR YOU!!\" Type of service.  Dinning area was trashed but that may have been due to a recent rush and also could explain the bad attitudes behind the counter.  You get a good discount when you book a room at the D so don't throw the coupons away. Its worth a trip with the coupon."}
{"text":"I expected more.... just an over priced hot dog- nothing special!"}
{"text":"The service was great and all the workers were in a good mood and friendly!!!! Happy to see people enjoying there job!"}
{"text":"I think it's time to be realistic about American Coney Island. They are now redundant. You can get better chili dogs at 7-Eleven and earn rewards at the same time. This business is taking advantage of its customers to the extreme. They went from 75¢ for extra chili on chili cheese fries to $2.25 for a small cup of chili. There's nothing spectacular about their chili it's the same kind that you can get at 7-Eleven and other gas stations. Then they want to charge 50¢ for tap water. I think you be better off going to McDonalds that is also located in The D. Once again you will get more for your money. Also I had to remind them this morning that they need to get exterminator to spray this place because there a cockroach coming out of the cracks on to the eating area. They didn't taking that seriously but I am sure an health inspector would. They should left this place in Detroit."}
