{"text":"My family and I came in fairly late night Saturday after getting back from vacation. We had a larger party of people (8). The food was fresh and hot, and portions were big. Pretzels were our favorite! Our server Lindsay was welcoming and happy to chat. Whole experience was smooth and a nice way to end vacation. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times, after this last visit a few days ago, there will be no more. I ordered chicken wings and the first bite I took, the chicken wing was completely raw inside. My beer had a fly in it, and the best part is, I'm fairly certain they charged me for them. They did nothing to make up for the problems. The bartender was nice, but most of the bartenders aren't. I want to love this place so much because it's so convenient for me, but I won't ever go back to this place until it changes owners."}
{"text":"A shame that good food and atmosphere is spoiled by such poor service.  Slow and, well, rude.  If you are not a regular,  forget it - you might as well not exist."}
{"text":"Delicious meats smoked fresh daily, wings were great, and the takeout containers were all cardboard :) Great service too!!"}
{"text":"Think this place has potential to be a good spot...  Just the bar tender would rather talk to her friends then give good bar service.  If you are going to put that much time and effort into fresh cut fries.. don't give the customer a burnt-greasy mixture of tiny fries at the end of the night either - customer next to us said we got the bottom of the barrel and it's an ongoing problem when he orders fries too.  Burger was really good!"}
{"text":"First time was dinner on 9/3/17.  Had the shrimp and fish in beer batter basket and the fish was fresh and cooked just right and the shrimp was a little strong but edible.  Smoked beans were great and their version of sweet slaw was great.  My wife's pulled chicken sandwich was very good.  Great beer selection.  Our server Nadia was great.
One negative was when they batter the shrimp they leave the tails on but cover them with batter.  If you batter tail-on shrimp you unbatter the tails before you fry them.  Or if you don't want to wipe off the batter on the tails PULL THEM OFF before you batter them.  Second negative was it was a little cool in the room which has large garage door like windows.  Which was okay until a server opened up one of the large doors letting in 55 degree air just to chill the room a little more.  I mean what the heck!!  

All in all a good place with good basic food and I will go back and I won't let 2 little negatives turn me off to Barrel Junction."}
{"text":"Go here if you are a masochist and love to suffer from their awful attitudes towards customer service and rotten business practices. First of all, don't bother trying to figure out what mediocre food they serve from their website; apparently, the business owner doesn't think it's important enough to update the website menus to reflect what they actually serve. When attempting a take-out order a few weeks ago, 75% of what I requested from the online menu was no longer served! After I questioned the very kind bartender about this, all she could tell me was, \"I hear you, I'm just the bartender.\" Next, the business owners obviously care nothing about customer service. I gave them another try yesterday, attempting to use a Groupon for a take-out order. Nowhere on the printed Groupon does it indicate that it is good for dine-in only. To my very unpleasant surprise, when my wife attempted to pick up our order, we were told that the Groupon was good for \"dine-in\" only. When my wife contested this because nothing on the Groupon stated this,the manager told her, \"Well, it USED to say that!\" and refused to honor it. Great attitude. Yeah, well, dinosaurs USED to roam the Earth too, but they're not a concern anymore now, are they? My wife paid for the order anyway, bringing home mediocre pizza I could have gotten from Pizza Hut and what supposedly passed for jambalaya, which resembled warmed over cat food with three shrimp laid on top of it. After I called to follow up on the Groupon issue, I got the same manager on the phone who gave me the same attitude, stating, \"Well, it says in somewhere on Groupon's website,\" then gave a half-hearted offer to \"make it right.\" I suggested that since he had no leg to stand on if the printed Groupon makes no indication that it is for dine-in only, he should honor it. He refused, twice. So bye bye, Barrel Junction. Best of luck building a customer base with these rotten attitudes."}
{"text":"My wife and I yet to have a good exerience.  We have been to both locations, and neither is any better.  The service is horrible.  It took abput 20 minutes after sitting to finally order.  We went with another couple this evening, and each ordered an appetizer.  The first appetizer took 30 minutes and the waitress said \"the wings need another 5 minutes\".  15 minutes later (45 minutes after ordering - over an hour into being seated), we finally got our wings.  We were on our second wing when our meals arrived (well, all except my wife's pizza - that came out a few.minutes later, and the pepperoni and crust was burnt), which left absolutely no room on the table.  These restaurants first need to hire more staff, and second need to train their staff.  It shouldn't take over an hour and a half to finish your meal from the point you first sit down."}
{"text":"Food was great! However, we had a large party, waitresses were not permitted to separate checks, STUPID! It actually created more work for the waitresses, we all paid by credit card and had to tell them what we had, it was KAOS. Next time we are going to pretend we don't know each other."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some apps on a Friday night. The atmosphere has a brewery feel. They have an extensive draft list but I opted for a glass of wine off the very basic but adequate wine list. We had side salads, the cilantro lime dressing was super refreshing and definitely homemade. We ordered three apps. The herbed chicken tenders. This could be a perfect meal for me. The other two were the fish apps, Cajun catfish and buffalo fish bits. They were both good. I would order the buffalo again. Overall, a nice experience."}
{"text":"Recently visited on a Saturday evening.  My family and I were crammed in the corner of the restaurant which is understandable for a busy evening.  Give the level of business, the service was just up to par.  

We were less than excited about the food.  If you're looking for bar fare, the place is acceptable.  Had the pulled pork sandwich with fries.. was not bad.  Will probably return at one point but won't rush to do so."}
{"text":"We have been here many times since opening. The rotating craft beer selection is great, the food even better. The food is priced well for the high quality. This is not chain restaurant/frozen food service food. The ingredients are quality and it shows. We've tried nearly everything on the menu and it is all excellent. Great food and a casual atmosphere. They offer a variety of specials and change up the menu with good frequency and the staff is friendly. The space  is cozy and can fill up but be patient, even the patrons are friendly!"}
{"text":"Great place for delicious beers on tap and pub food. Small set-up, so come early & hungry. Fair prices for huge portions and really excellent service. Ask for samples of their various beers on tap to try what sounds good! Highly recommend and will return soon!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended from a friend of ours. We came and tried it out for my birthday on 8/1 and we were not disappointed. All fresh ingredients, nothing frozen. Fried pretzels with tomato and jalapeño beer cheese are absolutely delicious and the pepperoni pan pizza, OMG, phenomenal!! We came back today for lunch and had the fried catfish sandwich and bacon cheeseburger. We were not disappointed. The smoked bean and potato salad sides are delicious. We'll definitely be coming back for more!!! The service was also fantastic which made our entire experience quite enjoyable!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. The food is great. I wish they were on the Nowait app as they can be super busy and there is no where to wait comfortably. Would go there more if they had the app. No affiliation, just use that for OTB at north park and works like a charm. 

Please please please get Nowait app!"}
{"text":"Great food and great beer selection.  The fish and shrimp basket is awesome!"}
{"text":"Don't bother coming if you have kids....no children's menu and especially limited seating for children. If they are hosting a party 2/3 of the seating is gone...the majority of the remaining seating is stools. Not good for kids under 10. 
There always seems to be something occurring here that turns me away. 
Other than that the food, drink and staff are fine."}
{"text":"I have to say, this out of the way, hard to find place is a gem. Great beer selection. Awesome apps and great burgers. Only down side to tonight's visit was that at 7pm they were out of several food items such as pulled pork. That was disappointing, however my buffalo blue cheese burger was great. The Smoked chicken dip was great too. And did I mention the nice draft list of craft beers??? Great selection that rotates on a daily basis. Find it and try it."}
{"text":"Great place for great burgers, fries, pizza, and more--, omg the Mac & Cheese skillet is delicious.--try the shrimp appetizer and pot stickers!  Chef Ron Deluca knows how to make the crowd come back for more!  To the whiners on older reviews:  so--go to Pizza Hut, quit complaining about service and go at a less crowded time ( maybe) .  It's a BAR and the food is worth going back for!!"}
{"text":"Our second time here and while the food is good - the service is horrible.  It took us two hours to get through an appetizer and dinner (two sandwiches).  Our waitress never asked how the food was and didn't ask us if we wanted another beer.  My food was spicy and I had nothing to drink.  Very understaffed - Very drafty with the door.  Good Beer Selection - that is if you can get more than one drink.  Self Seating kinda stinks too - you're huddled next to people who are eating at a table.  
My husband who never complains could not get over how horrible the service was."}
{"text":"Fun neighborhood  bar feel !!Food and service was good  and great craft beer selection   Would recommend"}
{"text":"We waited too long for just ok food.  Nothing to write home about! Just typical bar food, so-so service. Don't think we will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and beer selection. Atmosphere was also enjoyable. Table service was sub par due to lack of work force for the amount of business that was there. Bar service was excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great soups, salads, burgers, pizza and excellent smoked meats. Yum yum! Craft beer too. They are opening a new location in Shaler off route 8 as well. Bet it will just as good!"}
{"text":"We went here because of the yelp coupon and we really liked it. We had the cubano and the beef brisket sandwich and both were tender and juicy. The atmosphere is very laid back and they have specials for sporting events. We can't wait to come back to try out all of the other items on the menu because we just couldn't decide the first time we were there. Definitely a comfort food type place."}
{"text":"My wife got food poisoning from shrimp jambalaya, vomiting twice in the car driving home. So now she doesn't feel good. Also  had to blow money and time on car wash."}
{"text":"Great beers, great food, great prices.  The BEST wings in the area (my wife is from Buffalo, so we know good wings!).  I suspect people giving one stars are competition that never actually ate here.(yes - that's YOU Nathan L. with only two other reviews ever on Yelp all posted on the same day - how is your job at the Breakneck Tavern going where you gave 5 Stars to a clearly crappy restaurant??). Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service! Smoked chicken wing dip was delicious and the brisket sandwich was yummy!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife last night. We sat at the bar. Bartender REGE took great care of us. The entire staff was friendly and knowledgeable. They DO know their craft brews. The beers were great! The food was just as good. We had mini pork sliders(great) and Grilled Chili Garlic Shrimp (also great). Everything was great, we WILL return!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I wish I could give it a 3.5 star rating however. Every time I have gone, all two times, the service has been rather sub-par. The food is yummy and drinks are good...as others have said, the location truly does not help this place. The one in Shaler has much more visibility. Nice beer selection to choose from and it's great that they consistently rotate. 5 stars for grub, and 2 for service...but I'm hoping I just caught the servers on a bad day...even those in the service industry are entitled to a rough day every once in a while."}
{"text":"Food and beer selections are Great!
Service is Excellent, staff could be a little friendlier.
Prices are on the higher end so be prepared but the overall experience is very good!"}
{"text":"Great local place with a friendly and inviting atmosphere. The food is great as well as the service. The portions are generous and the food is delicious. Make sure that you try the Nachos, Pizza or burger."}
{"text":"A Saturday evening during March Madness. The food was very good. Burgers, MacNCheese, salads, etc.
The service was somewhere between horrible and hilarious.
Hardworking, courteous servers of various experience levels put in a very bad situation by the \"ownermanagercook\". Being seated we were told there would be an hour food wait after ordering. It was only 55 minutes though. There are maybe 20 tables in this restaurant, with 5-6 servers tending to them, desparately trying to apologize for the slowness of the kitchen and then later(9pm) for the running out of various menu items, some necessary to making a hamburger.
I will mention again that the food tasted great and was beyond our expectations. But it may be the poorest run restaurant I've ever visited.
It was actually entertainingly captivating. Kept wondering what twist was next or if we were on a reality candid camera show. Hope they fix things. The food was very good. Beer selection solid."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away right off route 8 and 910. The inside looks like it was newly updated and has a nice bar atmosphere. They have a few chalkboards with specials on them which adds a nice touch! 

The menu is very simple and not overwhelming at all. I decided to get the pulled chicken sandwich with fries that I upgraded to chili fries. Both were delicious! Everything was very fresh and homemade which I love. The only thing I would change is that they used dark and white meat chicken in the sandwich and I do not like dark meat chicken. That is just a personal preference though! I greatly enjoyed it all!

My only dislike was the service. It was not busy there but our food took longer than it really should have. Our Waitresses must have been new or not trained well as she was really slow and not very attentive. 

Aside from that I loved it and I will be stopping here again!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what brought Barrel Junction to my attention but once I saw the menu I wanted to give it a try.  Plus with 20 or so beers on tap there was a lot of potential.

I met some friends here on a Saturday night around 6:30pm.  The place was packed.  And it was not very bright inside, at least not in the room where we were (not in the bar room but the side room with high tables).  My initial impression was this is a great place for suburbanites to go for a night out.  Unfortunately, I'm a city girl.

The draft list, while an impressive selection, was not updated.  I tried to order no less than 3 beers listed that were no longer available.  If you want your draft list to be a draw, keep the chalk board updated.  Our server could not seem to remember more than one thing at a time.  Given we had a party of 6, this got frustrating pretty early on in our night.  

The star here is definitely the food.  We started off with some appetizers to share.  The nachos with smoked chicken were great.  The chicken had a mouthwatering smokey taste and those jalapenos were the freshest I think I've ever tasted.  They were out of the smoked buffalo chicken dip so we went with the BBQ pork and cheddar dip.  I'm glad we did because I can't imagine the buffalo chicken dip being better.  A few of us ordered meals including a pizza and burger (I was told both were delicious).  I went with the mushroom and Swiss sandwich - minus the mushrooms.  My sandwich included the house smoked beef brisket, Swiss cheese, horseradish sauce, lettuce and tomato.  I found there was so much meat the lettuce and tomato got in the way (not necessarily a bad thing).  My sandwich was the highlight, but a bit messy.  I would recommend ordering the sauce on the side.  For my sides I got fries and the sweet slaw, neither of which I really cared for.  The fries were way too salty and the slaw was bland.  

Did Barrel Junction live up to the hype?  Yes and no.  Overall the food and drinks that were available give it a 4 star review, but the service was more of a 2 star rating.  I split the difference and went with a generous 3 stars.  Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the uncomfortable chairs at the high tables that made my legs sore.  If I go back to Barrel Junction, it would likely just be for takeout."}
{"text":"This is a locally owned place so it gets an extra star.  I think they could improve on the menu and service but overall it's a cool different place and a change of pace from the big chain restraunts.  It's not a 5 star place though."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great craft beer selection. Delicious food. Perfect night out if you're in the North Hills area."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food..... about 2 for the service. On a Saturday afternoon during a Pens game there was 1 worker.  The place was buzzing and the bar was full.  I'm not shaming them for being busier than expected, but how servers handle busy times is important.  A simple, \"Hi, I will be with you in just a second\" could have gone light years in the situation, but instead we were blatantly ignored and sitting at a dirty table for 15 minutes and finally approached without so much as a \"Hello\".  I had to ask, after someone from the back cleared the previous guests' drinks and check, for the table to be wiped down.

I ordered the cobb salad with smoked chicken and my mom ordered the pulled pork quesadillas.  Both were very generous portions and tasted delicious. The menu here is extremely impressive and I don't doubt most everything else tastes as delicious as the food we had on Saturday. 

It's a really cool industrial - barnyard décor and I think this restaurant would do great in Lawrenceville or Bloomfield if they cleaned up their service a little bit and had more people staffed for the Saturday lunch hour.  This is off the beaten path with (from what I know) little signage.  Probably hard to come across if you don't already know where to look. I don't get out this way very often but is definitely a place I would like to bring Bobby back to try.  I'd be happy to give them another shot..but this particular experience left me wanting more in regards to service at at a restaurant. So, just A-OK for now."}
{"text":"We ordered take out- steak salad, good flavor, I had chicken bbq sandwich also good. Our major complaint, no silverware or napkins in the bag. We were not asked if we needed them or they would have gotten a higher rating."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive for just a bar atmosphere. $13 for a burger? $3.75 for a bottle of Bud Light? I took my wife and family for lunch and the bill came to almost $85. The food was good.....but not that good. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm giving a four star for the food and beer selection.   Absolutely great.  This was our 2nd visit.  Portions are large and very tasty.  Howver, our waitress was about as miserable as they come.  We had her on both visits, and thought the first time she was just having a bad day.  Definitely needs a new career path.  We will go back but hopefully on her day off."}
{"text":"It's a bar with bar food. I think beer drinkers like it, but for me, the mixed drink tasted completely void of alcohol, even after I asked it to be remade in a rocks glass rather than a large drinking glass. Ordered the cob salad and it was meh. Rumor has it the pizza is good, but a few people ordered it and it looked average. In all fairness I didn't try it, so maybe it rocks, but I didn't hear anyone raving about it."}
{"text":"This is our first visit, and it has been a really good experience. The wait wasn't long at all for 6:00 on a Friday night. We ordered the hot pretzels for an appetizer. The beer cheese is amazing, and so are the pretzels! 

I ordered the pulled chicken club sandwich and it came with two sides. I picked the spicy slaw and fries. The spicy slaw has a decent kick to it, so unless you can handle more than a 5 on a scale of 1-10, then beware. I loved it! The sandwich and fries were great as well. Good flavor on the chicken. 

My boyfriend ordered the pan pizza with pepperoni and it is a large portion. We have to take more than half home. 

We had a great server. She was friendly and attentive. We are looking forward to coming again!"}
{"text":"Great place with great craft beers and awesome food.  It may not look like much when you walk in but it has a great menu.  You can tell the owner is a true chef and has designed menus with wonderful tastes.  Not you typical bar with fried food and pizza.  Give it a try, you will be back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Barrel Junction and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious, the staff was friendly, and our food arrived quickly. I had the brisket sandwich, fries & spicy slaw with a Raspberry Kiss to drink.(yum) My husband had the fish & shrimp basket (the shrimp were huge), fries, spicy slaw and a glass of blue moon. We can't wait to go back to try something else. We went on a Friday at 5:00pm"}
{"text":"We needed some lunch ...looked to our trusty yelp app for what was nearby and Barrel junction it is 
its a sports bar with a back dining room
the dining room is bland but it does have big garage door type windows I wonder if they are open in the warm months
there are tvs at the bar
menu has smoked offerings 
salads 
and what I chose  fish wedge 
its actually a pretty cool sammie 
pizza dough is the \"wedge\" acting as your bread
fried fish with slaw and fries in the sammie
tarter was on the side 
all in all a nice spot for lunch"}
{"text":"Delicious food and generous portions which is fitting since most sandwiches are $12 or more but they come with two sides. (Note: you can order fries even though they are not listed as an option on the menu)

So far I've tried a burger and the chicken Parmesan sandwich. Both were excellent and a really good quality. The chicken parm had pepperoni on it and I personally judge a place based on their pepperoni. Barrel junction offers the small pepperoni that curls when cooked and collects all of the grease. What can I say, I like grease and this pepperoni is my favorite! The nachos and Bavarian pretzels are also delicious. 

I like that they offer a weekly draft and cocktail and that they have a decent beer selection. 

Route 8 definitely needed a place like this!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy this bar is in my neighborhood. Great food, a cool industrial decor, friendly bartenders, and a plethora of awesome craft beer selections make this place a must-try for anyone within the greater Pittsburgh area.  I love the burgers (which could compete with the best in Pittsburgh, including Tessaro's) and ANYTHING on the menu with their smoked meat, including the buffalo chicken dip. You can get a sample of any of their wide arrange of beers on tap, so take advantage. Also a fun place to watch the Steelers, the Penguins, and the Pirates. A nice mix of locals, first-timers, and out-of-towners make for a fun and welcoming clientele. If you haven't been here, add it to your list. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great for takeout.  Food was ready when we got there and went right to bar to pick it up.  Ordered wings (4 different sauces) - all good.  Liked the dry rub and garlic parmesan the best.   The smoked buffalo chicken dip was awesome.  Chips were nice and crispy too.

My only complaint - the celery sticks (which I like with my wings!) were very weak (limp and rubbery).  

With the Yelp deal, our meal for 3 people was only $20 (+ tip).  

I had only been there once before and ate inside with my son.  Service was not so good but we both had burgers and they were yummy.  It was a bit pricey for a burger, but they were huge - could have shared mine and would have still been plenty.  Heard the wings were good so we decided to try them.   Will definitely be back.  Hope the service turns around for dining in (as I read other reviews that seem to have same issues: food great; service sot so much)."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer selection, and just a generally good vibe. Earth tones and retro styling make it a comfortable place to unwind after work, service is friendly, and the prices are reasonable.

Recommendations:

* Meatloaf sandwich
* Buffalo chicken pizza
* Steak ranch pizza
* Pretty much any style and flavor of wings
* Asian shrimp"}
{"text":"This is such a great place! The bbq is legit with all of the meats being smoked perfectly, and the sauces that accompany them being very flavorful. You will find the smoked meats in many of the dishes that are offered and you won't be disappointed with any of them. My wife and I love the buffalo chicken dip (best we have ever had) because the smoked chicken that is used in it brings a great new element to an already tasty dip. We have also had the pulled pork and cheese dip and it too is excellent. As far as the entrees go, we have tried the regular pizza, the pulled chicken sandwich, the pulled pork sandwich, the cubano tacos, and the bacon and cheese burger. Everything was absolutely delicious. The pizza had a great crust to it and also has a tasty sauce. The pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches are packed with meat and feature a spicier bbq sauce that is delicious. I normally prefer a smoky bbq sauce with pulled pork but this sauce is so good that I crave it. The cubano tacos feature the pulled pork (no bbq sauce) and is accompanied by Swiss cheese, red cabbage, and ham. A Cuban sandwich is my favorite type of sandwich and these tacos nail the flavor. I have mentioned in previous reviews that I am huge into bbq and smoke my own meats and make my own sauces and rubs, and I have to tell you that whoever is manning the smoker at barrel junction knows what they are doing. The pork in these tacos shows this, as the smoke flavor is perfect and really makes this dish. Now onto the burger......this is the absolute BEST burger I have had and all burgers are also all 1/2 pound. The first thing I noticed is that it was cooked to a perfect medium as I had requested. I know that should be a given, but you would be surprised at how many places either under or over cook there burgers. I could tell that the burger wasn't pressed on the grill at all either because it was incredibly juicy. The burger was also seasoned perfectly. Bottom line....if this burger didn't have any condiments or toppings it would still be delicious. It can absolutely stand on its own. Great job Barrel Junction."}
{"text":"Stopped here last night for a quick dinner.    I had the pulled pork sandwich after I asked the waitress her thoughts on it.   Any place that smokes their own meats is worth a try.  And it was quite tastey.   The sandwich is huge and comes with two sides (double fries for me, and it was a mountain of them).

Everything was good, service attentive and friendly.

My only grip is seating is first come, first serve with no hostess so it's a bit of a free for all.   Before we realized it was seat your self some rude family barged past us and took the only open table left."}
{"text":"Nice place to stop on a Sunday afternoon. Regis working the bar was friendly and saw him interact with all the customers, and no one was unattended. 
Spoke to the owners mom, Mrs. D, who is the best Italian mom, we all wished we had!! 
We ate meatballs and the nachos with beef brisket, all yummy...and great beer selection. 
Good place to hang with friends, you can feel comfortable bringing children too (not infants, please, I want to drink beer & watch golf in peace, lol)"}
{"text":"It's a shame Barrel Junction suffers from a lack of visibility - it's truly tucked away right near the junction of Route 8 and Route 910 in Gibsonia. It's practically hidden behind a barber shop. I think this place would be booming if it had better visibility from the road. 

Location woes aside, I really loved my first experience at Barrel Junction last week. I am currently eating leftover barbecue chicken dip for lunch. That item alone below me away - a cheesy, creamy dip stuffed to the brim with BBQ brisket, bacon, onions, accompanied by tortilla chips, and served in a miniature cast-iron skillet. It's honestly one of the most impressive, and tastiest, appetizers I've ever had. 

Barrel Junction is a neatly decorated bar and restaurant, if a bit dark. It has a stained-wood theme with all sorts of awesome artwork on the walls. I didn't get any drinks from the bar when I was there, but it looked large, and quite busy. Their draft selection seemed pretty big just based on the chalkboard behind the bar. 

Food quality was really, really good. Portions are enormous, or at least the caprese salad I ordered was. It was brought to our table in a metal mixing bowl big enough to wear on your head like a helmet. The flavors all came together quite well, and while the presentation maybe was a little less than 'refined,' I went home with enough salad to pack for lunch the next day. 

I had read some less than savory reviews about service here, but I gave it a try anyway and had no complaints. Our food was served quickly and at the appropriate temperature. 

My only complaints are that I felt some of the appetizers were a bit overpriced, and finding this place is honestly a little frustrating if you don't know where to look. But, overall, I enjoyed the casual atmosphere, and the food was a welcome surprise. I hope this place can thrive where it's at, because it really brings something new to the Hampton/Gibsonia area."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the area and found this on Yelp while driving down 8. It was a little difficult for us to find, but like I said, we're new to the area. 

The service was quick, and the food was better. We'll definitely be back. Next time, I definitely intend on trying some of the craft beers."}
{"text":"We ate here after a Sunday pirates game when I didn't feel like cooking. Ordered the nachos with pulled pork to start. The nachos were amazing, but the portion was HUGE! With just the two of us, we barely put a dent in them. I ordered the mushroom and Swiss sandwich and it was good. I really enjoyed the spicy slaw and baked beans. Husband got the pulled chicken and it was unimpressive. While the chicken was moist, the sandwich was pretty bland. He got the fresh cut fries as his side and they were good. Neither of us are big beer drinkers but they had an extensive beer menu. Definitely a casual sandwich/burger/beer spot. Not was good but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Not bad...after going to the original store in Gibsonia, we thought we'd check this one out.
The food was very good. We were there at 1:30pm on a Friday.  Beer battered fish & shrimp basket $15, and a cheese burger $13, pitcher of beer $12ish.... the fries, slaw and soup (mushroom brie) sides, also good.  
The fish & shrimp had 3 large fish pieces and 4 large shrimp...well worth the $15, but $13 for a cheese burger....it was a good cheese burger...but not sure why it's so expensive...it was a cheese burger. :/
Good food. Good service."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food is great and it has the best beer selection in the immediate area.  I want to put a bit of warning here, I have a small child and there are no booster or child seats.  That being said they are in the business of selling fantastic microbrews so their ideal client isn't the guy getting just one drink with his baby in tow.  
     If there is one thing that I most reccommend on the food side is their smoked meat sandwiches.  They just fall apart in your mouth and for the nearby location are the best option.   
    Go for the beer though, the draft selection is amazing, and whoever curates the choices does a pretty good job of keeping a nice mix on selection.   Their bottle choices are good as well.  If you are looking for Bud Light or Coors Light this probably isn't your jam though."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times since this summer, each time resulting in a satisfying meal and a nice time.

I can't speak highly enough of the smoked meats, which are done right out back in a smoker.  They do chicken, pork, and brisket.  Brisket's OK, pork's really good, and the chicken is fan-tas-tic.  So moist!

I'm also a big fan of the white pizza here.  The large is a generous portion, and the flavors are great.  I typically like thin crust pizzas that are more doughy than crunchy, and though this pizza has a bit thicker crust I think it's very good.

Solid pizza.
Great house-smoked meat.
Reasonable prices.
Nice service.
Chill atmosphere.

5 stars.  Can't see why not."}
{"text":"We live close to Barrel Junction and it is our favorite go to. I am a wing lover and the wings are so yummy! I have been there many times and loved every experience. The food is so good you just have to go try. The cocktails are very good as well. My husband is a beer man and he loves the wide selection they have every time we go. The owner is very connected to his establishment and you feel so welcomed.The soup is killer there as well. The bathrooms are clean and the place is welcoming . It is right off of 910 you have to go try. Trust me you will enjoy your trip."}
{"text":"My wife and have eaten here twice. The first was a good enough experience to return, but the second time left us very disappointed. 

We had burgers and beer on the first occasion. The burger was good and the beer selection was good for the area. 

The second time we dined here, the menu had changed to more of that from a dive bar. The food was all so greasy that neither of us finished our meal. 

It is too bad that Barrel Junction doesn't offer better quality food. This could be a great spot for a beer and dinner"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends on a Sunday afternoon. Atmosphere was really laid back and chill. Had a nice bar see ton and when I go back I'll definitely have to partake in some drinks. 

I got the chicken pesto sandwich and that was very acceptable. Large portions and decent food for the price. My other forms got a salad and could only finish about half of it! It was served in a giant metal bowl. My girlfriend had a bbq wrap which tasted absolutely delicious. 

This seems more of an after work kind of place to go hang out and drink. Great selection of beers and I can't wait to try them next time I go."}
{"text":"Great beer. Good food. Atmosphere is nice! Friendly staff. Great for the 30,40 something crowd not for children. Good local place to meet up and enjoy and evening."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  Used the $20 for $10 deal on Yelp.  I had the salmon salad and my sister had the smoked pulled chicken sandwich.  My salmon was smoked too.  It was delicious.  Service was excellent and the food came out really fast.  The prices are really reasonable and they smoke all the meats on the premises.  They also have a nice selection of draft beers and a diverse menu."}
{"text":"Great pizza, my wife's beef brisket sandwich was perfect. Our first time and we will be back."}
{"text":"Eeeehhh...it smelled like smoke? I dunno what to say. My bf and I stopped at Barrel Junction after visiting a buddy who lives out that way and when i walked in I was pretty excited to eat some BBQ. He ordered a pulled pork sandwich with fries and I got the brisket sandwich (no bun because I am a loser sometimes) with spicy coleslaw and baked beans. I really liked my sides!! The coleslaw was spicy which is great because all things should be spicy and wonderful. The baked beans also had a kick but were rich and tangy as well. My brisket was not bad but it was a little bit strange. The slices were super thin and I could not detect any existence of that beautiful pink ring you want to see with your BBQ. I don't know if I am correct in my thinking but I almost felt as if it were lunch meat. I mean...I ate the whole thing. But on the level of amazing barbecues of meals past, this was not one of them. I wouldn't mind going back but I most likely would not be the one to suggest it."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We ordered a small cheese pizza for our son ...it was pretty big. It's really cheesy and a little too soggy for my liking but he loved it. I ordered the jerk tacos they were good. They were on flour tortillas which I am not used to but they were tasty. My only complaint was they didn't have any booster seats or a place to change kiddos in the bathroom. It is more of a bar setting, but definitely was fine for my 2.5 year old. Maybe it's their way of discouraging kids to be there? I'm not sure. We made it work, though."}
{"text":"Ordered a strawberry pineapple sangria. Not one strawberry or pineapple in it. Very bland. Ordered wings extra crispy and they came extra rubbery. Stick to the beer if you go here. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were so excited for this restaurant to open because it's so close to his house! We have been here three different times and were happy each time. I suggest going on Wednesdays for wing night! Their wings are great! We also enjoyed the pizza, the crust is awesome. The meatballs and Cuban sandwich were just okay...which is why I chose 4 stars rather than 5. They also have a great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Apps were $1.00 off during Steeler game. Shrimp app was tasty but not worth $9.00 for 4 shrimp! For example my buddy got the smoked buffalo dip- $7.00. Very filling but in comparison to the shrimp, get the dip."}
{"text":"Would have loved to have tried the food but they did not have a high chair available... Bummer"}
{"text":"Where is this place? Oh yeah, I see it... they need a lighted sign. It's right beside Lin's Garden to the left (they have a lighted sign). It's located in Richland Plaza accessible from 910 or route 8.

Dropped in on a chilly Friday night. The entrance was energy inefficient with one door and no dual door setup to minimize cold air drafts. There was a plug in floor heater sitting in the entryway, which I witnessed two people trip over. 

The left wall of the joint is lined with bench seating. Parallel to that wall is an L shaped bar that turns as it approaches the entrance. The right side of the joint is equipped with high top tables. Which I'm not a fan of usually, but these seem to be larger than normal and solid structurally.

A sign told us to seat ourselves so we cautiously ventured around the heater and found an empty table against the wall. We sat down and quickly realized the heater above was blowing so directly, it was drying out our eyes. We rearranged ourselves and stayed out of the line of fire.

Our waitress was very nice, quick, and helpful. We ordered the Smoked Tomato Risotto Skillet and Steak Bacon Ranch pizza. Fried gulf shrimp topped the cast iron skillet filled dish with a couple crispy bread slices. It came with a pretty hefty salad as well. 

The waitress suggested the pizza and I quickly said I'll try it. Honestly, it was my first ranch pizza EVER. I've had pizza many times, and I've never attempted to seek out out ranch for it. Never collapsed into peer pressure of friends trying to get me to try it out. Just a simple non agenda pushing waitress suggestion. It was creamier than I'm used to but it was good! I found myself putting a generous amount of red pepper flakes on each piece to kick it up a notch. 

They had a bunch of beer that I'll probably end up trying on a return visit. Maybe a burger or another pizza..."}
{"text":"me and my Husband heard about this placeand had no idea that we passed it all the time.you have to go in the back of a strip mall.it was a saturday afternoon around 430 the place was empty except for a few locals at the bar.servicewas friendly and helpfull .we both had sandwiches the chicken club was outstanding.beer selection was great. started to get crowded around 545 . prices were reasonable.next time we go back we are taking our freinds."}
{"text":"Pizza daddies used to be my place, I was there once a week trying a new craft beer, watching the pens game, and just hanging out. So was devastated when I found out Pizza daddies was sold and under new ownership. Thankfully, I have not been disappointed with the many changes they have made. Starting with the new name, Barrel Junction, they changed just about everything. New look, new food, and more beer. Although they haven't added more beers, I've been told they will be soon. The one thing I was most concerned about was whether or not the bartenders were going to stay. The bartenders are some of nicest I've met and they are a big reason I keep coming back, thankfully, they have stayed and are very positive about the changes. 

I do miss the old look, and I am sad their food is different and they no longer deliver, but I am happy with all changes. It's still great food, great beer, and great service."}
{"text":"Coolest place in the north hills.  This place has great craft beer, cheap beer alternatives, and an awesome burger / bar menu.  It's kind of hard to find unless you're with someone that knows.  Otherwise just SIri it, very easy to get to once you know where it is."}
{"text":"This place is very good...the best in the area for laid back dining and a really great selection of beers.  The staff are helpful and they remember my husband and I everytime we visit.  By far the best place to eat and drink on Rt 8 in Gibsonia."}
{"text":"I've been here probably a dozen times in the past year and just realized I never did a review on this place.

I have had probably half of the menu by now and everything has been top notch. They have a 22 beers on draft, with my favorite being Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale. The service is not always the greatest, but if the bartender Rege waits on you then you will have good service. My favorite food here is the wings, fries, and soups. I can also testify that the burgers, pizza, fish sandwich, pot stickers and nachos are all good here.
The chef/owner here definitely has passion for good food and good beer. I will continue to be a regular here."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd location for this restaurant. We are regulars at the other location and when we heard there was a new location we just had to try it. It was only they're 3rd day open so we were curious how it would be. We went at about 5:30 on Saturday night and they were packed. The service was a little slow but I'm sure it will improve as they settle in. They have about 24 beers on tap, and just like the other location the food is awesome. They also have motorcycle parking. We will continue to be regulars at both locations."}
{"text":"Well if the web site state kitchen till midnight maybe on a Friday they should be open till at least 11:00.
O well will not try again considering I live five minutes away that a-shame Casey's kitchen says till midnight and they took my order at 11:00 with no questions asked . Looks like Casey's is the late night spot."}
{"text":"Their pizza is the best! We tried a traditional pizza with red sauce and pepperoni, as well as their take on the Chicago Deep Dish. While both were very good, the sauce and cheese combo on the traditional was out of this world. Very fresh tasting, and pairs perfectly with their beers on draft!"}
{"text":"First time and last time here. My husband and I ordered takeout. The staff was friendly so that's the 1 star. He ordered the hog wild burger with a side of beans (very small portion) and fries. The burger was okay, but not worth the price. I ordered the southwest chicken salad, and it was awful. The lettuce was soggy and the container was almost falling apart because of how soggy the salad was from the salsa. I threw it out and ordered from another place. I also ordered a side of onion rings for $8 and got home only to find that I did not receive them. I called, and the best they could do was give me a credit for free onion rings next time I visit by taking my name and phone number. I can't say I'll visit this place again based on the food and how overpriced it is for the quality. I've attached a picture of my soggy salad. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall was way better than we expected! It is quite hard to find (right off of route 8 and 910 in the plaza behind Mars bank), but it is worth finding. The service was superb, the beer selection fabulous (22 rotating drafts), and the food was fantastic. My husband and I split the Cobb burger (avacado, bacon, blue cheese...) and the brisket sandwich. Both were amazing, tender, and perfectly cooked. Each sandwich comes with two sides. The homemade fries were crispy and flavorful, and the baked beans were obviously homemade with 3 types of beans. They let you taste the beers on tap, and we fell in love with a strawberry Belgium. It was refreshing and so good. The pizza also looked amazing, so we will be back soon! Bring your own growler to fill!"}
{"text":"Horrible & rude service and nasty food. If you want to waste your money then go there. They should be ashamed to call themselves a restaurant. By far the worst restaurant in the area"}
{"text":"Love this place, never had anything bad. I like them so much that I had them cater a party for me. Fantastic smoked meats! They have 20 draft beers. Daily soup and sandwich specials but they changed the menu, again."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here on our way home from antiquing in a lovely Sunday afternoon. I started with a turbo palmer... and turbo it is!! California Cobb salad was delicious .. avacado, bacon hard boiled egg cucumber yummy moist grilled chicken. My friend has the fish wedge. The pizza bread was better than prima fish and slaw great, fries kind of soggy and sub par. I would have also liked more of a dressing choice for my salad but all in all a great meal . I didn't have beer but the have a selection of 24 on tap."}
{"text":"Did Barrel Junction jump the shark.  The service, which is sketchy to begin with, was horrible.  Yes, they were busy but as a consumer, that should not have any bearing on my dining there.  Initial drink orders were slow.  Nachos came out at a decent rate and were good. I did take notice the lack of pulled pork this time around.  All three of us ordered the same thing, pulled pork pizza.  A favorite and the usual go to. I asked to have mine with brisket even if there would be an up-charge and extra BBQ sauce on the side. Another ordered extra BBQ sauce on the pie itself.  Within a reasonable time the pizzas came out. I found no more than 6 or 7 small pieces of brisket on my pizza.  Pulls pork was almost nonexistent on the other two.  French fries, nope, hardly there as well. BBQ sauce...hardly any in the three pies, even the one that was to have extra.  The pies themselves seemed to be slopped together as well. My extra BBQ sauce came only after asking again, waiting 10 minutes, and only getting one of those teeny-tiny take out containers (.50 charge!).  The second beer I orders, never made it to the table.  Waitress was okay, not too knowledgable about he beer selection, but did split our nachos three-ways. 3-stars only because the flavor of the food is still very good.  Please take some pride in what you do, even if it means just slowing down a little bit."}
{"text":"Loved Pizza Daddies and was somewhat anxious when new ownership was announced.  My first order was the smoked chicken sandwich and I was overwhelmed by how good it was...smoky tender chicken, wonderful pablano peppers, on a nice crusty bun with a great chipotle mayo.  This was a comfort food with a college education! Since then, I have had the Beef Brisket pizza with its exquisite crunchy crust being a complement to the  tender beef and creamy smoked cheddar.  I could have eaten the whole pie!  I have also had the hot wings that were wonderful...hot, perfectly cooked, and  seasoned nicely.   I am only hoping that the foodies in Gibsonia realize how lucky we are to have what this area has been lacking....an upscale comfort food restaurant with great beer!     Truthfully, I am staying close to home to try everything on the menu....I have a feeling that I will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place! Easy to miss; drove passed and had to turn around but no big deal. Food was tasty and I enjoyed the different side options. Great beer selection and nice that one was on special."}
{"text":"The food here is really good.  I'm a big fan of pulled pork and the smoked chicken.  I've been here a few times, and have tried the following:

smoked buffalo chicken dip
corp chip nachos
wings
pizza
burger

Everything had great flavor and was delicious.  The beers are always good.  They have a great selection.  My only issue is with service. Most of the time, people are friendly.  We've had a few times that we've gone and felt ignored.  Every time I've gone it's been a weekend afternoon, so they weren't slammed. I'm pretty patient when the restaurant is busy, but when you're not busy, and we're still flagging down the waitstaff, it's not the best.  

The food keeps me coming back though. They don't have a restaurant like this anywhere else in the surrounding neighborhoods."}
{"text":"I agree with those who say service and food ticket times are slow, but that's where it ends for me. 

The BBQ was over seasoned and had a bracing,  acrid, smoky flavor. I'm not sure if it's mesquite smoked or they were trying to fake it with some liquid smoke. I couldn't eat more than one of the pulled pork sliders. 

The beer cheese soup had a good flavor, but it was thin and the vegetables (potatoes, peppers, and onions) were raw. 

Beer selection was good and the fries were pretty good. Doesn't warrant a return trip for me."}
{"text":"We've been anticipating the second location in Shaler for some time now since we live up the hill. The official opening was last Wednesday. When you walk in, the expansive bar is to your left and the first thing you notice is the warm rustic decor and the vast array of beer selections. There is something for everyone. Lite Beer, IPA'S, pumpkin flavores, porters, etc. There are several high top long tables in the front of the bar with numerous large TV'S for sporting events. The dining areas is in the back with garage doors when weather permits. 

A group of us sat at one of the large pub tables in the front and ordered a few beers and later a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was cooked to perfection with fresh ingredients and flavorable crust. My wife who is a pizza connoisseur commented that it is her new favorite. The bartenders are very attentive and helpful if you have any questions on the menu or beer. 

Great addition to the neighborhood and much needed in an area with not many options. The place will only improve as they work out a few kinks."}
{"text":"Our trip to barrel junction.  1.  Pizza resembled liquid more than food.  Also the 3rd failed pizza in a row.  Let the pizza cook go!  2. Watered down beverages.  3. 3 of 4 plates had dried on sink grime on them (crusty sink grime).  Rude host did not even apologize for poor quality of food.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Nice place, very clean and very spacious dining rooms. Bar area was set up very nicely. Had a chicken parm Sammy which was very crisp and tasty with the sauce and pepperoni on it. I will definitely try this place again. Everyone was eating the burgers which seemed to be the hit on the menu. I will try them next time. Beer selection was very nice and varied and not all ipas."}
{"text":"Stopped in Barrel Junction last night. It was around 5:30 pm. The place had a good crowd in the front and rear of the restaurant. They have high tables and chairs at the front of the restaurant and regular low tables in the rear. I was seated at the \"low\" tables.   I had a bacon cheeseburger with all the standard condiments.  The burger is not a frozen patty. Its a large burger on a large bun that I needed to cut in half in order to eat. You get 2 sides with the burger. I ordered fries and sweet slaw. The fries were crunchy and not greasy. The slaw was in a condiment cup. Not much to taste. The burger was cooked as I requested and it was very juicy.  Bacon was very tasty. I could not eat the last bite of the burger and left some fries. I was stuffed.  For me,  cost of the meal was in proportion with the amount of food that I received.  The staff is pleasant and very attentive. I will definitely return to the Junction."}
