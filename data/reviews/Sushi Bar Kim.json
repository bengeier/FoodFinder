{"text":"Les makis sont délicieux et les prix sont très raisonnables. Nous avons adoré le plateau pour deux ainsi que les makis tempuras. Dans le plateau pour deux il y a des makis aux tempuras de crevettes qui sont excellents. Les goûts et les textures se marient vraiment bien entre le croquant du concombre et la douceur de l'avocat.  N'hésitez pas!"}

{"text":"Best sushi ever! So fresh and and delicious first time there and im deffintally going back! Its not too pricy I was just suprised how not many people know about this place. I had the club sandwich , sushi pizza & the montreal.. as im writing this im craving it!!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the absolute best sushi place (not counting the fancy shmancy or seaside places). It's a bit hidden because it's located inside a higher end grocery store (that they also own), but once you find it, it's like a hidden gem that you either want to keep for yourself or show off to the whole world. I kid you not, I make the trip down to Montréal whenever I can, just to eat here. The owners are such good people, and their great characters show through the carefully prepared dishes, which by the way are also presented in generous proportions."}
{"text":"One chilly day, we(I was with my 2 little sons) need some place to hide from cold outside. We got into the underground-westmount square- Actually I live in westmount but I hardly use this mall, so I couldn't find this restaurant. We took 3orders of salmon sushi and chicken deriyaki and 4 deep fried shrimps to go. That was really fresh and tempting. The container also very solid,  so that can kept my foods thoroughly on my way home, they gave us salad and miso soup as a side dish, which was quite filling. That was enough for tree of us to share. I think they understand how to cook rice. I think this place is also the one of the precious places in Westmount."}
{"text":"I like soup noodles and I am usually not very picky about noodles and I understand this is fast food environment but I am very disappointed with what I got. I was very hungry when I come here and ordered a seafood ramen (10.95$). The seafood part is ok but the noodle and the soup taste worst than the instant noodle that I cook myself at home. I really think that they gave me a pack of instant noodle (I can see some powder on the side of the bowl) and add some seafood into the soup. It is fine if they tell me that they don't have the noodle and ask me to order something else but it is not fine to give me some instant noodle (bad quality ones on top of that) and claim that it is japanese ramen."}
{"text":"Walking through the food court at Westmount Square amoung all the standard food court places you see Sushi Bar Kim, a small restaurant with a sushi bar and seatting area. Your first thought may be \"I'm not about to risk it on a no name sushi place in a food court\". Although I understand that logic you'd be completely wrong. Sushi Kim is a hidden gem, one if the best sushi restaurants in Montreal.   They have a good selection of standard sushi along with some very nice house specialties and all of the rolls at Sushi Kim are available with an option of rice paper instead of seaweed.   One thing to note is that one of their chefs recently left to start his own restaurant, Park, and I'm not yet certain if his departure has affected the quality of the food at Kim as I have not eaten there frequently since he left. This is the only reservation keeping me from giving them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place already, since it's my favourite sushi in town. Everything is incredibly fresh and tasty. I could have their salmon grill or salmon teriyaki for lunch everyday and never get bored. Even their miso soup (a dish I generally pass) is amazing. This is THE place to go to for sushi or grilled salmon."}
{"text":"I'm a semi regular here as I live and work nearby.  For food court sushi, it is pretty darn amazing.  Miso soup is delicious.  They have a wide selection of creative rolls and everything is always super fresh.  Personal favourites are the spicy salmon and the seaweed salad."}
{"text":"My soup and my friends salad were supper tasty and fresh. Service was great, the dishes are a nice size and the Toro Sashimi was super fresh and the texture was excellent. I really enjoyed the place.  It is a bit hidden inside the Westmount Square Food Court. In case that you would be like me trying to find were is located, I tough was inside one of the towers ans not necessarily inside the food court, where actually is..."}
