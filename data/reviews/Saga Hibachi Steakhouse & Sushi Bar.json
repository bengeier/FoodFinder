{"text":"Awesome sushi...highly recommend the saga monster and rocking volcano!!!"}
{"text":"Strike 2 Pittsburgh. This place is ridiculous. It's amazing to me that it's more difficult to find a gas station or grocery store that sells a 6 pack of ultra light beer in this state than it is to find terrible sashimi/sushi. 
For those who aren't aware of the difference: sashimi is the fish in it's purest form. The best Japanese restaurants take pride in serving only top quality sashimi grade fish. Sushi is the fish you find either wrapped inside a sleeping bag of rice or placed sophisticatedly atop a bed of rice. Both require a better than average skill to make in excellent qualities and/or portions. Sushi/sashimi is an art form. 
This is the 2nd \"Japanese\" restaurant I've visited in the area and I'm beginning to think a good quality Japanese restaurant just doesn't exist here. 
Everything looked like it had been laying around for several hours. My sashimi platter was less than adequate and I didn't even want to finish it for fear of becoming ill. 
The spicy salmon roll, which I don't normally order but was feeling frisky for, again looked like it had been made 3 hours ago and was served to me as if it were just made. Even my wasabi (which I LOVE) had a brownish tint as if it too had been sitting in the open air absorbing particles only God knows about. 
My sake, while it came out nice and hot, was not the usual Gezekkan sake I'm accustomed to, and therefore by no fault of the restaurant for not having the brand I prefer, was just the icing on top of this nicely decorated but poor quality cake. 
I'm sorry to those who have found this restaurant amazing for creating such a poor review but I'm writing to those who are avid sushi fans; you know who you are. The ones who venture outside of the California rolls, the dragon rolls, and the Philly rolls; I'm speaking to you. Steer clear."}
{"text":"Contrary to the reviews I've read on here about Saga, we had a quite enjoyable experience. We arrived about 830pm on a Saturday and were taken back to a hibachi table with another couple right away. Our chef was extremely skilled, probably the best hibachi chef we've ever had, funny, interactive and made no mistakes in his routine. The food was excellent, we had our drinks filled promptly and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I will sum it up quickly.

10 minutes to get a hello and water, because the hostess had to tell the waitress to come over

20 minutes to get our drinks, which of course, were watered down to basically water

50 minutes to get sushi. Yes sushi. You don't even have to cook it.

Never again. Ever. Unless I'm blacked out and wander in."}
{"text":"I stopped in for happy hour at Sage.  I ordered the half price Sashimi plate.  I was amazed at the quality of the fish for $4.50.  Also $2.00 bottled beer.  It will be a stop for me everytime I am in the area on business."}
{"text":"Service is awful. Waitress was so mean to us and we saw cook walking around wearing undervest, shorts, apron and flip flops. Shame on u guys! I'll never come back."}
{"text":"It's gross in the kitchen. They wash their greens in big trash cans. Not joking. The sushi is over priced and pretty gross. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"We like Saga and normally have a good experience. We tried the Robinson location and were surprised with very slow service and poor food quality."}
{"text":"Today, myself and several of my coworkers called to order lunch from Saga at Settler's Ridge. We are pretty regular customers of the establishment as we all enjoy the sushi roll lunches. Much to my dismay, when I asked to place an order for said lunches, I was told that, since today was a holiday, they were only doing dinner prices all day long. That, in and of itself, is ridiculous.  Yes, today is President's Day but the vast majority of Americans who don't work a government or banking job, it is just another work day. When I asked to speak to a manager, I was given over to some dude who said there was no manager today and he couldn't do anything. 

The food here is OK, just OK. The service is bloody awful. Good luck getting out of here on time during your lunch hour. This latest greedy action today pretty much cements that, from now on, I'll go to one of the other sushi places in Robinson like Ichiban or even Market District. 

Stay away"}
{"text":"Gist - Think benihana + sushi restaurant; but you can order off both menus

Why Go?
* You  want to be entertained while someone cooks a meal in front of you
* You don't mind sitting with strangers
* You want thick cuts of sashimi
* You like grilled chicken; beef; shrimp
 
Charashi Bowl - $17
* ~12-15 pieces of sashimi; didn't like the octopus ; but good variety  
*came w/ miso soup & salad
* Salad was reg. lettuce w/ some thousand island dressing vs. the more typical ginger/peanut sauce
*thick sashimi cuts; fresh so that really enjoyed

Combo Chicken & Shrimp Dinner - $21
* came with soup, salad, fried rice, grilled veggies (zuchini, broccoli)& chow mein
* good portion chicken tender; 2 shrimp well cooked

Notes:
* Seems very popular for b-day parties at least on the hibachi side
* Have sake bombs on the menu 
* Usual hibachi entertainment - volcano onion tower, shrimp tails toss into chef hat, spinning egg; etc."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Sushi is not fresh and expensive for what it really is. Gets better than a 1 star for location and nice staff. I only ate take out sushi so rating based on that. I'm from the Hawaiian islands where sushi is abundant and this would be a 0 star there."}
{"text":"We went there tonite for our granddaughters 6th birthday celebration.  It was the worst hibachi experience I've ever had.  Food was rather tasteless, portions of veggies were very small, the fried rice was very blah, chicken was dry, service was extremely slow.   I called ahead for reservations and to let them know we were celebrating her birthday....once there she mentioned it was her birthday.....they did nothing personally to acknowledge her birthday.  Ordered ice cream for the kids for dessert and after about 20 minutes they informed us they were out of ice cream.  We've been to this location several times in the past, it was never an exceptional experience but tonites experience was extremely different from other times.  We will not be going there again and do not recommend this location.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant,  food was basically just ok, portions small,  management staff very rude ! Don't bother !"}
{"text":"Bad service bad food! Waited 20 minutes for a table and they weren't even busy! The sushi tasted like wet cardboard probably because we had to wait another 40 minutes for our order to arrive. There was a hair in the shrimp sauce that was so nasty! Just steer clear of this place, unless you want bad service and bad food!!! Yuck!!"}
{"text":"While i love sushi above all other foods, i enjoy knowledgeable staff as well. Our sushi was good and more importantly, fresh. However their staff was clueless about the sushi, making it hard to order what we wanted. Some more training for their staff and i would give them 5 stars. They need to learn the difference between the basics such as sushi and sashimi.....etc...."}
{"text":"I'm typically a big fan of Saga but my last trip there was a big disappointment. I made dinner reservations a month in advance for a arty of 6 celebrating my cousins birthday party.
We arrived a little early but they seated immediately. Our waitress came and took our drink order and came back with our drinks and tool out app order and sushi order....not a single person came back to us for 45 min. When our waitress did return my friend politely asked about our app and the waitress turned around and snapped that she has a party of 20 and she will get them when she can. I was personally so shocked!!! She came back a minute later with the sushi app that had clearly been sitting for some time. An our after we had been seated we had no drinks and our chef arrived....the chef was awesome and the fabulous bus boy refilled all our drinks. I wish we could have tipped them directly as our waitress was horribly rude and nasty until she gave us our check. We all of course tipped her but were very disappointed in how she treated us, if it wasn't for the rest of the staff we would have most likely left"}
{"text":"The sushi here is very good. The chicken fried rice is amazing, considering it's such a simple dish. 

The service is hit or miss though. I've been here with my wife many times. We come back for the food, not the service. Sometimes the wait staff is great, and sometimes you have to ask for plates and chopsticks...."}
{"text":"if I could give 0 stars I would. They are RUDE, unprofessional and mess up orders all the time and dont take accounability for it. I dont know why I keep giving them more chances.Even the little chunck manager or whatever she is , is a rude person. AVOID"}
{"text":"Maybe the majority of the previous Saga Yelpers were hangry. Maybe the establishment is working to improve its poor wrap. Either way, we had a pleasant dining experience here. A free Groupon deal lured us in the door so, admittedly, my expectations weren't too high but Saga delivered. The food was average hibachi fare equivalent to our usual Ichiban. Every single staff member - the person who seated us, our server, hibachi chef and even the bartender who bid us goodnight - was pleasant and attentive. Our server refilled my husband's drink no less than 4 times (yeah, he's perpetually parched) and the chef did his best to entertain our quiet table of four. We will definitely be back to try their sushi happy hour."}
{"text":"when my co-workers suggested a hibachi place for dinner, my initial reaction to myself was \"OH GOD! WHY WHY WHY?\" i dont like hibachi. the food is bathed in butter and the whole show....cheesy. and we are in western PA, how good can the sushi/sashimi be? well....i was pleasantly surprised. the decor was nice, it was clean, and spacious. lucky for me we didnt sit in the hibachi section and we got seated right away and after reviewing their large menu we got the sushi, sashimi, and teriyaki dinners. the sashimi was great. good portions and good quality. the only thing that was annoying was the happy birthday song in a japanese accent? and disco lights that were coming from the hibachi section. but overall, the food is good here. and service is prompt."}
{"text":"I have been here on multiple occasions. The food is very good and the prices are good for the hibachi places I've been to. My biggest problem is the cleanliness. 

Everytime I've gone there to sit at a hibachi grill, it was clearly not cleaned. If it was, it was a gentle wipe at best. There is leftover food from previous meals fried to a crisp and sometimes sludge in the corners from cleaning the liquids at the end. Keep in mind, I've been to four or five hibachi places and have been to two of those five ten+ times; my favorite I go sometimes multiple times monthly. My point being I know how the grill should be cleaned and look. Here it's just not up to par and I don't like my food getting mixed with old burnt up rice from God knows when. Due to that cleanliness problem, I rate it a two. 

It's a nice place, the decor is great and besides the very hard to understand waitresses the real problem is the cleanliness. Fix that up and I'll be back more often."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. I didn't like the food the first time. Today we thought we give it a second chance. 
The food was horrible.  How do they call it sushi,  when they blend it with bread crumbs. Yuk!!!
Our bill was $117.00 & half of it was bread crumbs. 
We ordered tuna tar tar and it was blended with bread crumbs.  We couldn't taste the tuna and it was like $12.00.  Yuk. The salmon,  white fish, & tuna were all blended with bread crumbs.  Service was horrible. I will NEVER visit again"}
{"text":"If i could select lower then 1 star i would. read the already horrible reviews X 10! the soup and salad  was horrific, the rolls in my 28$ meal was all cucumber, the added order of  salmon roe with quail egg 15$ was so  pathetic, i was so out raged i got up from my table and brought to the chef to shame him,,,, DON'T GO THERE. REPEAT IT IS A SHIT HOLE!

ps , if you want to go to a sushi restaurant  with out a wait, you found your place,,,, say no more...."}
{"text":"Came for lunch.  It was aight...the Age-tofu was too breaded (thin tofu inside :( ) could use more egg in the fried rice.  The Amazing tuna roll was not that amazing...the ahi tuna was seared?! I'll probably give it another try.  I came here bc I was desperate for Asian food.  I'm an island girl from Hawaii now Eastcoast livin haha."}
{"text":"Visited here with my husband for a date night. Food was bland and typical, also small in portion size. Service was slow, however I should note that there was only one waitress taking care of tables. The worst part was that I felt we WAY over paid for the food and service we recieved. Disapointing and will not be back."}
{"text":"Good food excellent server, he was funny and helpful. My check was 45$ cheap, also I tip him 35$ so the total 80$ I forget his name but next time I go to saga I will request him to be my server."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. Sushi. It was very bad. Dragon roll was about 1% seafood...see pics for yourself.  Very lame...sushi chef should be ashamed.  Will not go back and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Hahaha!!!!  Loved the \"stick-in-the-muds\" who shared our table ( 6 of them, 5 of us) ,,our Chef went out of his way to incorporate all of us, but they were having no part of it. The food was incredible, the cooking skills were A+ and so much fun to watch. I dont think it's possible to walk out of here hungry. Loved it."}
{"text":"I love this place, I've been here a few times and each time the staff and especially the chef has been fantastic. Everyone acted with courtesy and professionalism. The portions are large, the food is good, and the meal is entertaining. Great experience."}
{"text":"Sushi is a small step above giant eagle sushi. It is ok if your don't wan to drive into town to get better sushi. 
Sat at the sushi bar today and another customer came in after me and ordered. His sushi order was completed first even though I ordered a good 10 minutes before him 

The sushi does not seem as fresh as I have had at other places. 

I enjoy the hibachi better here than the sushi"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious the atmosphere is phenomenal And the severs are very kind i recommend if you're hungry for hibachi and entertainment!"}
{"text":"Okay I have to update my earlier review went there yesterday for my birthday which my family has made a tradition for everyone's birthday to say the least this may be our last time there our waiter mike was nice a little slow in the beginning but became a very good waiter the cook Charlie seem to have a small problem with his waiter Charlie refused to perform for us all he did was come throw the food on the hibachi grill no flare no performance no nothing. We asked him why he was going so fast he mumbled something in Japanese and continued cooking my wife got up to go find a manager the manager Linda at first said Oh I remember you you complained before my wife has never complained at this restaurant before and was very upset about this she told the manager no I haven't and told her what was going on the manager's response was oh I don't have much to do with him I'll let the owner know. The manager then stood in the doorway and watch Charlie do nothing extraordinary in fact do nothing at all other than cook she then came over to our table and offered us $20 off of our meal we told her we had three separate parties that met us there for my birthday meal she then proceeded to offer 15 percent off of everyone's check this on top of them not having any soft drinks because of their co2 cartridge ran out no lemonade for the children all they could offer the children was basically water o.r iced tea this restaurant sure has went downhill. In talking to our waiter it seems that Charlie has a problem with him and us to see him quite frequently this was also confirmed by the manager who had pulled Charlie aside and told him that his actions were unacceptable and he had told h her that he was not performing for table for that waiter to me this is insubordination he should have been sent home but instead he went to wait on another table and wow it was a great performance the waiter mike was very professional about all this basically telling us he doesn't know why he does this he says Charlie gets in his  well Charlie's mood is cost this restaurant at least 9 customers that come back at least monthly if not weekly my advice stay away or ask for someone other than Charlie he used to be our favorite but that has ended the manager and waiter told us we could contact the owner directly via the website which I did I am eagerly waiting for a call back but do not think I will get one"}
{"text":"Precisely what one expects of a strip mall restaurant- nothing more - nothing less. Mediocre food - nonexistent service"}
{"text":"Sadly the service was slow, the bathroom and the restaurant were both dirty.  The food was below average and the best part of the lunch is that I'm  pretty certain me and my husband got food poisoning from either the steak or the chicken!  Thankfully our little guy did not to eat the meat!   We will not be returning EVER!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Had the regular sashimi dinner and it was great. The sushi chefs are artists. I've had the hibachi a number of times as well and always enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Cleanliness was dodgy. Martini was uninspired to put it nicely. Tea is $2.50 a cup? Really? Even when you're spending $24 for a poorly done filet mignon teriyaki plate? The soba noodles had a rancid oil taste. Absolutely never going back."}
{"text":"Everything is good if not a bit overpriced.  The restaurant is very clean (I look for this if they serve up raw fish!) and the service is always very efficient but a bit on the cold and perfunctory side.  

My go to items here are:
Signature roll - basically tempura shrimp roll with fish roe and shrimp salad on it.  It's a goofy item but it always hits the spot.

Tuna sushi - very nice serving of raw tuna on rice.  Hard to complain about this.  

Gyoza appetizer - always a crowd pleaser in our family.  

As much as I like coming here, I always have to deal with the Teppanyaki operation next door.  Which is a bit of a techno Benihana experience.  Actually, it's a nightmare.  But, it's clearly a crowd pleaser so I'm sure that's why it's kept up by the owners.

The music, the lights, the awful showmanship like squirting Sake into the mouths of the adult patrons lined up around the fry table and shouting goofy stuff like: \"MORE SAKE, MORE SEXY!\" and then singing: \"NA NA NA NA, NA NA NA NA, HEY HEY HEY, SAKE TIME!\""}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I will say they have the best shrimp fried rice I've ever had buuuutt yes but the sushi was not stellar and the hibachi was good but could be better which is my reasoning for the 3 stars other than that it was nice with friendly staff"}
{"text":"My daughter has experienced two different Saga locations, we happened to stop at this one after a day of mall shopping. The atmosphere is dark, more trendy, and not warm, and welcoming as I've experienced in other Japanese restaurants. We sat at a booth with upholstery that looked as if Freddy Krueger had sat there. We started off with the Rock N Shrimp, presentation was nice, but shrimp were cold. My daughter ordered the Beef Teriyaki, and I chose the Shrimp Soba. Presentation was okay, and my daughter enjoyed her Beef Teriyaki, my Shrimp Soba left me disappointed. I couldn't get over the feeling of eating a bowl of ramen noodles with shrimp and vegetables. Not the thicker buckwheat soba noodles I was expecting. Flavor was non existent in my dish, and if I had known, I would've requested some Sriacha or other sauce. 
At the beginning of our meal, we were brought out two bowls of a clear miso soup, and a small iceberg lettuce salad with a Thousand Islandesque dressing. Both were nice, but bland. Perhaps my taste buds are spoiled by other more flavorful Asian foods, and not used to the 'clean' taste of Japanese style foods. Or maybe, Saga just doesn't cut it with great food to begin with, and I was expecting too much. Service was efficient, and friendly though."}
{"text":"I have NEVER disliked the food here. Let's be clear on that. The service and manager are absolutely despicable and I don't know how they are still in business. 

The problem is the horrible service AND management. The same short woman is always there w a smug look on her face and never does anything to make customers happy. We had a large group for my graduation there, literally had to track down the waitress every time we needed anything, and they didn't even bother to apologize! So, since I liked the food but not the service, I started just getting food to go. They even screw that up!!!!!!!!!!!! I waited almost 30-40 last night for 2 sushi rolls. They hadnt even been started when I came back after 20 min like I was quoted. I doubt the hostess (who was in PINK leggings, quite unprofessional!) even put my order in since it hadn't been started. I expressed my unhappiness to the manager and she brushed it off like it was nothing. Customer lost! Id rather get sushi from Giant Eagle than give my money to this place again. so disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I hope their owner checks these reviews from time to time, they should really know their  business is being ruined by a very poor manager. She is the only one I ever see there so she must be the only one."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it.  Really.  Tried it a few times but decided it's just not good.   Sushi is horrible, service is horrible.   In full disclosure, I only ate at the bar, but am done trying it."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and sashimi. Living in California, I'm pretty spoiled for great Asian food, and also skeptical of sushi so far inland...but I happened upon this place with my mom once, and now I try to go whenever I'm home. The ingredients are always fresh and flavorful, and it's not too expensive, either. Often the place is nearly empty, which doesn't at all reflect the quality of the food (but does mean quick service!). I hope people will start supporting this place more, so that it can stay open."}
{"text":"Good food and show. Sushi tastes great and they have a choice of sake. Not the cheapest place, but worth it a few times a year."}
{"text":"Not a good place to eat at all. I am hoping I don't get sick after the chef used the same utensil to serve us lo mein noodles after using it to place raw chicken on the grill. Stomach is turning at the moment. Highly would recommend eating at any other place than this. Plates aren't even clean and servers are rude and very unskilled, they clearly hate their job. Server didn't even bring me back the right receipt and we never saw her again as they rushed us out the door. I can't even figure out why I stayed there and ate that crap.... GO SOMEWHERE ANYWHERE ELSE BUT HERE! Absolutely the worst place I have eaten in years."}
{"text":"Service is very friendly and warm. Unfortunately, food takes a little bit longer than average, and the quality is the equivalent of grocery stores.

That being said, the size of rolls is more often than not small as well, which doesn't add up with the price they ask. I would come here for their 50% off deal on mondays after 4!"}
{"text":"I am a very big hibachi and sushi fan, so naturally I had to check this place out. My first time here I ordered a boat of sushi with my dad, who is also a huge hibachi and sushi fan.  The presentation of our food was lovely. We both got salads with ginger dressing and they were probably about standard as far as salads with ginger dressing go. The ginger dressing however was a bit  on the sweeter side, and a little bit creamier than most, but still good.  Sushi was not outstanding but not terrible. I recommend the sweetheart roll which is remotely similar to spicy tuna roll, but the sushi is rolled and cut to resemble a heart. Overall, enjoyed my sushi(as always), but have had better.  Will have to go back someday and try their hibachi and other entrees."}
{"text":"Had take out sushi... the Signature roll was delicious. The salad was lacking but other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE bad service terrible food  was given the over priced check before we were even done!! went ther for a birthday was charged 8.00 for some frrezer burnt ice cream asked to see the manager he did nothing for us but made us feel like we botheredhim and gave us a hard time I contacted the owner and she did nothing for asking to see him save your hard earned money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Saga is an awesome restaurant! We were going to another sushi restaurant down the road for the past 5 years. This place opened about a year or two ago and it has officially hit our #1 sushi restaurant for the past year. My husband hates to go to sushi that gives you small rolls. Sushi isnt cheap so you want your $$ worth. The sushi here is great with nice portions. This past weekend we went and there was an issue with a coupon that we had. I talked to Cassie and told her that they are our favorite sushi restaurant and she was able to satisfy the situation. So another great job Saga! Keep up the great work!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever, salmon was mushy, white tuna grey in color. A place for a high school boys to take his main squeeze and people that don't know or care what they are eating. The staff was very kind and can't help that there money grubbing manager just wants to make money, not serve Quality!"}
{"text":"I went to Saga on Monday night for their half priced Sushi & sat at the bar. There was fruit flies EVERYWHERE - I was literally swatting flies off of my food and my beer. My food was left on a counter for at least 10 minutes before it was brought over to me and my friend was almost done with her food by the time I got mine. So disgusting.. This place is dirty. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Walking in, I was surprised with some upbeat music and singing as the restaurant staff was singing, \"happy birthday\" to a customer.
That was a nice gesture on their end.
So I came out here for lunch on my break and ordered the combination platter with a salad and extra veggies as to avoid carbs from the rice and noodles.

The food was delicious and quick! 
The service was great.
I see myself returning here again in the near future.
Plus it was nice to get a 20% off discount from checking in on here."}
{"text":"Four of us had a business dinner here midweek.
We ordered the Pink Lady Roll (lots of salmon, my favorite), the Dragon Roll (delicious) extra Salmon Sashimi, the Sashimi deluxe (delicious and fresh). The portions were generous and the food very good. The salmon melted in my mouth. I would order all the same things again! One person ordered a few cooked dishes but I didn't try them. Complimentary orange chunks arrived after we finished eating.
The place was full and lively. We sat on the right side near the sushi bar but at a table. Our timing was not lucky enough to snag one of the three booths. There were many families. The lighting was good. 
Our server was a little off. But the others looked on their game for their tables."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI IN MONROEVILLE!

I myself am a self proclaimed sushi addict and this place really hits the spot and is happily close to home base. The sushi here is fresh and inventive. I sit at the sushi bar most of the time and appreciated the clean and orderly work station. The staff is friendly too!

Menu Fav: Y2K Roll

Only negative was valentine's day - the place was bananas - people need to make reservations for special occasions!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Saga several times, but only for lunch. The service is either hit or miss. Today we were greeted immediately and asked what we wanted to drink, but other times it's taken 10 minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes the food takes FOREVER (I've been here for two hours before) sometimes I'm in and out in 45 minutes. The lunch specials are great. Two small sushi rolls with salad and soup for 9 bucks! I also love the lunch special hibachi shrimp for $14. They have outdoor seating, which I enjoy. Nice lunch spot, but be careful if you're in a time crunch as it's always a gamble. And beware of the little candies by the front door. You may think they are mints, but looks can be deceiving! :-x"}
{"text":"I have heard some say that all Hibachi Restaurants are pretty much the same.. and I must disagree completely!  Saga is unlike any other hibachi restaurant I have been to.   
1) Its difficult to not notice how clean the restaurant is..  it's the first thing I noticed when I walked into Saga the first time  
2) Great wait staff/hibachi chef  (never had to wait for my water to be refilled!) 
3) Food portions - plentiful
4) Quality of food - outstanding
Okay so I am not a seafood lover like most of America but I love a good steak.  The Hibachi Steak Entree is pretty fantastic.   There was nothing ordinary about it - super flavorful! I had a great experience during my first visit.

  Thanks Saga!"}
{"text":"I love hibachi, but I'll never go back to Saga. The service was absolutely horrible, the hostess and waitress were both extremely rude. It took twenty minutes for the orders at our table to be taken, and then the waitress started to hand out to-go containers while everyone was still eating. Food was also thrown at me. My younger brother, who is underage, was offered saki. He refused several times before eventually accepting, because the employees were so insistent. The tables, chairs, and floor were all greasy, probably due to their habit of throwing food at customers. On the upside, the food was pretty good. I wouldn't go back though."}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh and delicious . I didn't care for the hibachi last time I was here but the sushi was excellent at this visit.   Chirasi was great and the sushi chef made it look beautiful! Spicy tuna hand roll was good too!"}
{"text":"i live in new york part time, new york being \"the land of the cheap and delicious sushi.\" after i moved back to pittsburgh, i was bummed to find that sushi places are few and far between. my friend suggested sawa, so i went along, and was very pleasantly surprised! the lunch menu is great (3 rolls for $11, plus soup and salad? yes please!) and the sushi itself was very tasty.

i'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch. I got the salmon jalapeño appetizer. Outstanding! We also got the double spicy roll (good) sweetheart roll (very good) and our table  favorite was Saga monster roll. I didn't taste the hibachi. It's a great choice for a quick bite - especially considering the other food court options!"}
{"text":"My family had a really bad experience here Saturday night.  Our server never came back to check on us until we complained and then it took forever to get our check.  My mother-in-law had to wait until after the meal was served to get any rice.  Why?  After we complained the server finally brought out a bowl of cold, white rice instead of fried rice and then had the nerve to argue with my mother-in-law instead of correcting the issue.

While this was going on, I noticed the hostess kept talking to her friends (who did not appear to be employees) instead of working.  Also, why are employees allowed to wear street clothes instead of uniforms?

During all this mayhem, the manager seemed apathetic and unconcerned at what was going on.  Food wasn't anything spectacular, but it wasn't bad either.  We ended up taking most of our food to go.  Before we left, I briefly spoke with the manager and asked for the owner's contact information.

Overall, I felt the staff was rude and disrespectful.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Decent sushi. no brown rice, but otherwise very good!"}
{"text":"Sawa (now Saga) is another chinese-run hibachi/sushi combo places, that try to be entertaining.  While it may not be amazing, still beats most of the other places around the area.

Been here a few times, and a couple of things stick out:
1. that annoying chinese waiter/host guy with glasses who treats customers rudely and thinks he's funnier than he actually is
2. cool dinner seating (non-hibachi side) which you sort of climb-into, kinda feels like getting into those canoes you rent at the lake
3. the ridiculously fobby happy birthday song accompanied by a cheesy light show 

Sushi was decent when I tried it, it was above average quality for the area.  (the deep fried Sawa roll is actually good)

For Hibachi, I was pleased -- mainly since the chef asked to add less soy sauce into the fried rice (since I was with a Chinese party), and overall the meat was not as salty as some other hibachi I've had.  Filet was good, but I recommend against the chicken.

I also sampled the salmon teriyaki - but the sauce was pretty unappetizing. 

One might want to be wary of the \"no wait\" promise for Hibachi, which included 20 minutes of waiting area and 10-15 minutes before we got our chef.  Slightly annoying since our party included a 1 month old and also a 98 year old :)"}
{"text":"Clean and nice atmosphere. I ordered the Saga Monster Roll and it was absolutely delicious. Reasonably priced, not too expensive. The service was just okay, the waiter wasn't extremely friendly but everything came out quickly. I will definitely go back for more sushi."}
{"text":"Seriously horrible. This used to be my favorite place. We got a Groupon and in the instructions it said that we can bring the printed coupon or bring the mobile device to show the deal. We called in to make a reservation and they told us that was fine. WE TRAVELED 20 MINUTES TO COME HERE and they dare tell us they can't take our coupon. 

I left. I hope this place goes out of business."}
{"text":"From the outside this place doesn't look too exciting or nice, but don't be fooled! I first went here my graduation dinner, and the staff happily seated us around the table with another family. We went here again for another family outing. Hibachi can be expensive, but the lunch prices are certainly reasonable. The menu consists of several options. Each time we've gone here, we've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated. I just love the hibachi experience, and Saga certainly does it well. The soup is delicious; I don't care too much for the salad dressing but hey to each his/her own!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews. Glad I didn't listen -- I was pleasantly surprised. We were greeted enthusiastically. The waiter was attentive. The food was delicious! I had shrimp hibachi and my husband had chicken hibachi. The rice was especially good, very tasty. Used a groupon so it was well with the $13 for the $25 value. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've gone to saga a few times for whenever I've needed a sushi fixing, and overall their sushi quality has been pretty great. 

The atmosphere of the sushi bar dining area is nice and open. The wait staff was very friendly the one time I did go do a sit down dinner, but our waitress made a very racist remark about the other staff which made my company and I uncomfortable. We attempted to order desert, but they were out of almost everything. We were only informed once we had placed our order twice, only for the waitress to come back to inform us. 

While the food was alright, I won't be returning due to the casual racist remark of our waitress and shortage of foods while we were there."}
{"text":"i'm here pretty often and the service is amazing as well as the food!! the wait staff are so friendly and remember us!!! Love this place and their employees"}
{"text":"We dined here 4 times. Good experience. 3 times and 2 star experience 4th time. 

Bit of rude  manager and not good hibachi cook on 9/4"}
{"text":"Place is ok, hostess as you enter the place kills the mood. You don't feel welcomed. Poor service for the price charged."}
{"text":"Still spending a lot of time here in the Pittsburgh area and have tried almost every spot within a few miles from my hotel.  This place was next on the list.  I came here in the mood for sushi, but we also ended up deciding to sit at the hibachi.   

This place looks like just about any other hibatchi place that I have visited, nothing special or amazing sticks out from it.  The music that was playing was pop and some country songs came on. I personally really do enjoy music that is set to compliment the atmosphere, so I was somewhat dissappointed on that front. 

We were the only two at out table ( we got there pretty early, right after work) and service was quick and friendly.  I did end up ordering a spicy crab roll that was good enough that we ate it all, but not knock your socks off great.  I ordered steak and chicken, and my friend ordered steak and shrimp.  We got the usual soup and salad that comes before.  

The guy who prepared our food was fun and entertaining.  The food was ok, i just think they skimped on the good veggies ( over run with onions, and not so much zucchini), and I asked for no onion, but it was all mixed in ahead of time ( which I don't normally see) , so i got a boatload of onions.  Its ok, I'm not allergic, just don't care for them, so I just picked out what I wanted. 

THere was a lot of food. Too much to eat.  I had another meal in leftovers, but couldn't take them back to the hotel due to no fridge or microwave to eat later.  Next time, if there is a next time, I'll only get one meat....   

Not sure if I'll come running back here - unless I am in the mood for hibatchi, unless I find something in the area better"}
{"text":"I have come here a few times now and the sushi is consistently great and the servers are attentive and polite. Tonight I came here with a friend and we got the gyoza for an appetizer which was good, not the best I've had but still pretty tasty. For dinner I ordered the triple sushi which consists of 3 pc each of tuna, salmon, & yellowtail along with a spicy salmon roll (6pc) it comes with a salad and a soup... all of which were DELICIOUS! My friend got the saga roll and a sweet potato roll which she thoroughly enjoyed. Our server was kind and professional.. she always made sure our drinks were full, which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"Solid 5 on the sushi! They have some amazing special rolls that aren't on their site! Very good quality sushi and prepared well! Can't comment on hibachi because they all taste the same to me...
Also their lunch specials are quite a deal for the money!!"}
{"text":"where do I start, waitress does not listen too my order, I ask for for no vegetable in my fried rice I get plenty. I order the chicken no flavor what so ever. try cooking food with flavor, I recommend you go up the hill too shogun"}
{"text":"What can I say... I love Saga!  It's such a fun atmosphere with some of the best hibachi I've honestly ever had.  So, so, so cheesy (you have to love the birthday song coming on 20 times during your meal), but we always have a great night!  I've ordered both hibachi and sushi, and honestly it never disappoints.  The price is average for hibachi, and the chefs are (almost) always a blast - we only had one guy who was pretty awkward, but I think that was due to the rude people at our table who should've just ordered takeout if they were going to be so cranky."}
{"text":"It's another mediocre Asian cuisine place in Pittsburgh that is still packed, despite being mediocre. First off, I must give credit to the eye catching décor and festive ambiance. It's quite loud in there and you will leave smelling like hibachi from head to toe. Service was pleasant enough, but I feel so bad seeing how overwhelmed the employees seemed. A groupon gift brought me here, and after seeing all the unhappy reviews about the advertised vs. actual promotional value of the groupon, I did some research to make sure. Upon arrival, there was a sign at the counter clarifying about groupon use, which I assumed was placed after the restaurant received so many complaints. 

I started off with a plate of ika fried squid, which comes with a side of pungest sauce. Personally, I did not like the pungest sauce with the squid, I think it would've been better with a spicy and creamy sauce. The squid was overly fried to the point where it tasted rubbery. The panko breading added a nice crisp, but the toughness and dryness of the squid itself was such a turn off. For entrée, I had the chance to try the ton katsu and beef udon. The ton katsu came out in a huge portion, but again too overly fried and dry. The beef udon was flavorless and the noodle was NOT udon, it was more like glass noodle. 

Overall, I was not a fan of the food here nor the long wait, despite calling in advance to make a reservation. Definitely one of those hit or miss venue that I would slap the \"try at your own risk\" label on."}
{"text":"The service was great. Our server, Stella, was very nice and very courteous. The food was really good. It was my mums first time having hibachi and she loved it. Will definitely visit again !"}
{"text":"My one previous experience with hibachi had been good but underwhelming as far as the ambiance of the setting.  I'm not asking for an entirely authentic setting, but there's a few basics that it was lacking.  Enter Saga.

Beautiful setting with three separate sections, the restaurant, the bar, and the hibachi seating section.  Good decorations, clean lines, and clean overall.  The seating felt nice and \"private\" within the realm of hibachi seating.  And the service was good.

The food was the only thing where I found myself going \"eh, meh.\"  In the almost two hours that I was there I head \"Saki time\" or \"More Saki, More Fun\" every ten minutes on the dot--if not more often.  Which is all fine and dandy if you want to drunken the customers and hibachi cooks but keep away from my rice & noodles please.  The portions were huge, which I was expecting and hoping given their pricing schedule.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned while the shrimps were super plump and yummy.  But then ... there was the rice and noodles ... some bites were supper good and some bites all I could muster were flashbacks to \"more Saki more fun\" since that's all I could taste.

Overall it's an solid A-Ok.  I think once I develop a palate(sp) for Saki it wouldn't bother me as much. :-)"}
{"text":"Service service service. I am not hard to please, but come on, show us a smile, get us a drink in under 10 minutes (while sitting at the bar tended by at least 2 bartenders and patronized by about 6 of us). Serve us soy sauce with our sushi without us having to ask twice and resort to giving you pathetic looks of hunger as we stare at our sushi. I am almost glad to get on yelp and see so many bad reviews. Now I know it wasn't personal, and now I know why the staff doesn't give a sh*t about the customer - they get so many bad reviews, why do they have to even try? Please don't waste your time. I'd rather eat at home with my children ordering me around and not letting me sit down to actually eat. At least I can get a smile and some appreciation out of them."}
{"text":"Our family goes here regularly. The food is good and service adequate. I wouldn't give it stellar marks but overall acceptable rating. This is for dining room.  I do not like their hibachi section."}
{"text":"The quality was very good but the portion size went way down hill. 3 people tonight 92.00 I got 6 pieces of shrimp and barley any chicken usually I take food home but nothing left tonight not even rice. And I was very disappointed to see them serving sake to a minor we even brought it to the chefs attention but he just didn't understand us.. they better watch themselves.."}
{"text":"A succinct review...

The good:
The hibachi chefs are friendly.

The bad:
The decor was dark and old
The sushi was poor quality; the spicy salmon and spicy tuna were notably low grade
The salad was unappetizing, and the dressing tasted worse
The soup was bland 
Took over 30 minutes for the chef to arrive, even though there was only 1 other table of guests. 
The wait staff don't speak English well enough to properly serve a restaurant; I asked for regular soy sauce, instead of the 2 bottles of low sodium soy sauce, and it took 2 different people before I was understood

I've been here twice, and my second visit was my worst experience at a hibachi steakhouse. I advised the manager and the hostess that I had to leave in 45 minutes. Either they didn't understand or care, because I left without even the shrimp appetizer being prepared. There are much better places in Pittsburgh to get hibachi. Unfortunately, if you live near Monroeville, you'll just have to drive a bit to get to them."}
{"text":"Great service at the bar and awesome food. highly recommend! Probably the best sushi i've ever had in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I visited this place twice and since my first experience was very bad one due to pathetic customer service and rude behaviour of our server. But on 2nd time it was much better.

My shrimp and steak was great and i enjoyed the Hibachi way of cooking. Soup and Noodles were awesomely delicious too. Our server was decently sharp, quick and kept checking on us.

I hope that they should be consistent with kind of talent they have."}
{"text":"Last time I was here with my wife it was HORRIBLE I have written to the company and tweeted them to no avail ....what a letdown my food which I had the hibachi chicken and steak tasted like it was FLOODED in soy sauce....My wifes sushi plate she ate 2 pieces and couildnt stomach anymore and yet the waiter and manager on duty never said a word about it or asked if she liked it or had a problem. I will not be going back by choice anytime soon"}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least a dozen times, and I am satisfied with every meal. Not only is the half price Monday Sushi a great deal, but it always is delicious. Their spicy crab roll is out of this world! It's got this nice tangy spice to it. We recently sat at the bar and ordered hibachi, and each plate had enough food for at least 2 meals. Their shrimp sauce is sooo good. Plus, you get both NOODLES AND RICE. The service is always fast and polite. We have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The food was general hibachi, nothing special. I thought it was overpriced, especially the wine. They only had Barefoot and other really cheap wine options that they sold at too high a mark up.  The restaurant looked dirty. The vents above the hibachi stations looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a while. Service was slow for lunch when hardly anyone was there. They really did a good job on the decor in this restaurant, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Be careful with your Groupns, our party of 6 was limited to use of only 2 Groupons.  Had we billed our checks as parties of 2, we could have used 3 Groupons.  Not happy.  Staff had no clue as to what \"gluten free\" means.  Manager came over after the soup and salad was served, indicating the salad dressing and sauces were NOT gluten free.  Mind you, I asked several times prior."}
{"text":"My favorite place around for sushi. The prices and the quality of the ingredients are unbeatable. We always sit at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs are awesome. Can't praise this place enough! Wish I was going there for dinner tonight! :)"}
{"text":"We went back for Lunch early this month. I had Maki Spicy Crab rolls! They were fresh excellent and this time the sauce was spicy! Yum! My friend had Hibachi chic beef shrimp w rice. It looked great! We had Tempura shrimp app we split very good& waitress was very nice and understood! I'm allergic to cucumber so I ask no cucumber allergic and asked if I can have avocado instead so got 2 servings in it not charged extra! -If they keep up this great service; I'll return holiday time & do shop in mall& lunch here"}
{"text":"If I didn't love the sushi, I wouldn't frequent here.  In the dining area, the servers are awful. They are entirely unattentive and barely speak English, which is no big deal, but I was trying to tell our waiter we thought we had our order figured out, he saw the uncertainty on my face, because we are indecisive, and ran away. He didn't come back for 15 minutes.  But the food is so good, the shit service is worth it."}
{"text":"The prices are pretty steep but the server we had (I think his name was Darwin or Davin?) was incredible! I highly recommend this place for dates or for family gatherings. The point of hibachi I think is entertainment, and the cook put on a pretty good get up. Lots of fun, my salads, and soups were good, and everyone enjoyed their hibachi dinner. If someone in your party has a serious allergy, their hibachi dinner can be made in the back."}
{"text":"Will be back! First time at this location. Normally we go to south hills village location but never like it there. We had gift cards so we tried this location. They were very busy on a week night, which was great! We like going when a lot of people are present because it makes the experience better. We sat at the bar while we waited to actually be seated. The bar was nice, they were a little slow on service though and there were only 3 people seated at the bar (we were 2 of them). We were seated fairly quick, even for how busy they were. Our table was fun. Our chef was entertaining and friendly. The food came quick and our server was so nice! It was her first night. She did great and was so friendly, quick, and even informative! Wish I remembered her name! We got sirloin and shrimp, meal comes with salad, soup, rice, shrimp app, and noodles!!! You deffinately get your moneys worth. We will be back! This is our new favorite location."}
{"text":"I was surprised to be able to get decent sushi in Pittsburgh. It was not only fresh and delicious but also very artistic. Both of our plates had a pretty flower design while our sushi was so prettily arranged. They were definite works of art....in addition to being fabulously delicious. This also is the first place I actually got full on 2 rolls. They have cool, unique rolls. I had one with salmon, yellowtail, avocado and asparagus. The service was very good and extremely attentive. we had an all around very nice meal!"}
{"text":"Never again! Terrible service ... No table setting, napkins, forks or chopsticks. Waitress served soup with no spoon  and we had to wait to catch her as she zipped by 5 minutes later. Seaweed salad came and still no utensils! Finally our waitress flew pas and handed out chopsticks but no napkins or bowls for soy sauce. Finally I got up and stole utensils from another table that was set up. Just as soon as we were finishing she was ready to get rid of us. Wow, just my husband and I not a table full of screaming food throwing kids. If I would have had a pen I would have signed my receipt \"No silverware and napkins with our dinner NO TIP\" warning take your own chopsticks!"}
{"text":"Suddenly seeking sushi, the weary-eyed travelers stumbled upon this Saga. 

If this Saga were a Martini it would contain: 

1 part Hibachi
1 part Sushi 
1 part TGI Fridays
1 part amateur, dry staff 

This martini would be assembled by staff members who were clueless where the reference \"shaken not stirred\" came from. 

The biggest problem with this restaurant is the staff. From the hostesses to the waitstaff we're dealing with amateurs here. 

The hostesses are in desperate need of customer service training. Too busy to annunciate their words, too busy to welcome you, too busy to smile and too busy to look up from their paperwork; customers are an inconvenience. If they weren't so clueless, I'd teach them to spell the word E-X-P-E-N-D-A-B-L-E. 

The waitress was sweet, genuine and efficient. One complaint: I inquired about the size of an appetizer and she attempted to flag down a nearby waiter. With three chefs in sight, the nearby waiter apathetically replied, \"I don't know\" and walked away. The waitress apologized and I ordered something else for the sake of time. Again, the waitress was great, but failed to use the chef as a resource located within feet of her. 

The quality and the meal was disappointingly average. Gourmet grocery stores have a similar product when prepared on request and assembled in front of you. If I had nothing else to compare this to, I'd have given Saga a mitigating 3 star rating. 

Verdict: Whaddya expect from a chain-resturant? This Saga is to be (dis)continued in my book. Go fish."}
{"text":"I came to Saga for lunch in between shopping at south hills village just to experience what they had to offer. Upon walking in to the restaurant, everything seemed really dark and weird. My girlfriend and I went for the sushi, since we weren't really feeling hibachi at the time.

Our waiter seemed awkward, kind of like it was his first day on the job or something, but it was OK because he didn't bother us too much by coming around every other minute.

We both ordered the lunch special, which was a salad or miso soup and the choice of two rolls for $8 or three rolls for $11. All together we ordered a California roll, a spicy tuna roll, and two tuna and avocado rolls. The spicy tuna, was by far the best. The tuna was fried or something, but its warm nature accented the sushi amazingly. We loved it. The other rolls were average, and nothing great.

Overall, it was a decent lunch for two under $25.00."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, went here 3 times in one week while on travel. This was a awesome place, great food, service and entertainment. Great happy hour all day Monday specials too!"}
{"text":"We decided to drop in at Saga on a Sunday evening for a family dinner (parents visiting). The place was pretty dead, and the staff took some time to organize which empty table to seat us on. I think they need a dedicated host/hostess at all times (not only during peak hours).

Once we were seated in the Hibachi section, we were met with a great waiter - he kept checking in on us and seemed sincere. The Hibachi chef was a playful dude - did his tricks, cooked some tasty food, sprinkled water on us (to prevent us from heating up near the fire), and tossed veggies and squirted sake (not together) in our mouth. Maybe a little too playful for me but entertaining. 

I found the Hibachi food at this place much better (tastier and perfectly seasoned) than some other places I have tried (Ichiban and some other restaurants in LA). The shrimp is my favorite, next is chicken and then steak. My wife tried the salmon and seemed to like it too. All the Hibachi entrees come with noodles, rice, veggies, soup and salad and the portions are big i.e. you do not go hungry and you get food worth the money. 

The restaurant is good sized, with a bar and separate seating for Hibachi and Sushi. The interiors look modern and clean. 

The last time I was here, I received terrible service as our waitress did not seem like she wanted to be working. Though the sushi was fresh, tasty and ample (Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon, Shrimp roll), it spoiled my experience. As my recent experience was a positive one, I will give Saga another chance and hopefully the service can impress me as the food definitely does. The three stars round up for both my visits (service and food)."}
{"text":"Decent hibachi. Wasn't busy. The bad reviews do it a disservice. Not as busy as other Sagas or other hibachi restaurants. Can't speak to their sushi here. It other Saga sushi has been decent."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a family dinner about a week ago. I'm sure everyone is aware that you have the option of having the chef do some fun cooking in front of you. I have 3 girls and they were all fired up about watching him. Yes, I played the seal when he tossed food in the air and caught it in my mouth. Who said i don't have talent. ;)

Ok, my wife and I both went with the steak and shrimp. You get the rice, noodles, and veggies all cooked in front of you. The chef and server were great with the kids for you parents. They did the volcano of fire from sliced onions. They tossed me food, i performed. As a heads up a kids meal is $12 so keep that in mind. Either way,the service was great and they were on top of everything. A fun time for a date or a family function."}
{"text":"We came to Saga before going to the movies at the mall.  It was a Saturday but it was very easy to find a table (not sure if this is good or bad :)). Our hibachi chef was very entertaining and joked with us, making the whole experience better.  The rest of the waiting stuff was also on top of things and very helpful.  The food was tasty, even though I am not the biggest fan of asian flavors (and this is why I only gave it 3 stars) and I also did not order anything elaborate.  Hence, people with similar attitude  with me can try the place; I feel they will not be disappointed. Particularly the sauces that accompany the hibachi are very good! I got the chicken hibachi, while I also tried the beef and they were both good.  If I around the mall I will not bring any objection in visiting the place again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. This place is sub par when it comes to customer service. We sat an hibachi table, one of us ordered a sushi roll, and another order a hibachi to go for after. The sushi never came, when asked about it she said it had to be fried and the roll we ordered only consisted of fresh fish. The to go order was forgotten and took another 20 minutes after we were done eating. Worst hibachi in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The shrimp fried rice was rice and soy sauce plus shrimp.  Not good. 

Seats are all torn up"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the quality of food or the staff. The food in my opinion is like fast food Japanese rather than getting a good quality dinner. While our cook was fun, the waitress was nothing special. The filet was cut in pieces that were too big. The most disappointing thing was to see a birthday next to us where the staff abandoned the singing of happy birthday halfway through leaving one lone waitress to sing the last two lines. We had two birthdays in our party and decided to skip asking them to sing and leave to have dessert elsewhere.  I don't know what happened to giving a shrimp appetizer with meals either. Overall we way overpaid for a mediocre dinner and a little entertainment. I will stick to Benihana or Ichiban in the future. Quality has never been a let down at those locations."}
{"text":"This place has went down hill.  Horrible.  Terrible waitresses.  Rude staff. Waiters standing around. Im sure it wont be long before they are closed."}
{"text":"Best sushi for the drive from New Alexandria.  It is awesome!  The service is very friendly.  They have the special tables that feel like you are sitting on the ground, too.  It is a hibachi grill, too, but I'm all about the sushi!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Was here for a friends birthday party...our chef was AMAZING and tons of fun! He was friendly and performed sooo many tricks! In addition the food was fresh and delicious! We would definitely go back here again...if you decide to go...ask for Harry!"}
{"text":"Nice place for Hibachi, fresh food, quite environment. Its a nice resturant for fun time with friends."}
{"text":"Soooo, if you haven't figured it out already from my previous reviews, I eat sushi quite a bit. Saga in Robinson often fills that void, as it's an easy stop on the way home from work for me and my coworkers.  My experience is limited to the sushi, so I can't speak to the hibachi offerings... though they do always smell ah-mazing. 

Saga's sushi menu is extensive, offering some combinations you don't see anywhere else, and you can't beat the happy hour prices or  1/2 price deals on Mondays (bar only).  I highly recommend the Sex Salmon appetizer on any given day.  While it may sound odd, I promise its delicious: crab stick (kani) wrapped with sashimi salmon and drizzled with ponzu sauce.  You receive 4 pieces per order, and for $5 during the bar happy hour, it's a steal!  I always order this as an appetizer, but I like it so much that sometimes I order a second portion with my sushi! 

Some of my favorites are the Sweetheart Roll, Magic Roll, and Fantastic Roll, but I'm also always just as happy with a spicy California roll or yellowtail scallion roll in front of me.  I will say that sometimes the bar seems understaffed, but I'm usually here during off-hours and before the dinner rush which could explain it.  

Overall, this place does the trick when I'm craving sushi and don't feel like driving out of the way or going somewhere where the rolls are all deep-fried and covered in 6 different sauces (ick)."}
{"text":"I have been going to Saga since I first moved to Pittsburgh, almost four years ago now. 

Their sushi is amazing & their bartenders are great at mixing drinks. It can get loud and crazy in here because of the hibachi but none the less it is a great restaurant with a great overall experience. 

If you are ever in the Robinson area, check out their sushi line up & their wine list."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, the food and service was wonderful. I had chicken and shrimp habachi with extra fried rice. My bestie had the same thing, except hers was steak instead of chicken. The cook was my favorite part. He was very smiley, and the food was soooo good. We came for lunch because we had a groupon. According to the groupon: you get 2 dinner meals of any choice for $25. Of course this was too good to be true. I dont remember what the bill came up to but they claimed that will still owed $25 on our tab. We were confused because we believed we were getting a 2 for $25 to say the least. The manager informed us that the groupon takes off $25 from the tab but you had to pay the remainder. Long story short, if you ever go here, please don't get a groupon."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend while scoping out the Mall. She's an avid hibachi fan and I hadn't had any in a longer period of time. 

We came and sat as the first two at the communal table, which we sat at alone and empty for about 20 minutes before it filled up. Naturally this is not the restaurants' fault, however the waitress who was also serving filled-up adjacent table, took a good 10 minutes to even acknowledge us and ask for our drinks. She came back immediate asking for our menu items as if to start the process, but then seated the remainder of the table and started the process all over again. Oh well.

The when soup and salad came as an appetizers, my friend ask specifically for no salad dressing which naturally was ignored. Meh. The chef came to cook he tried his best to do the over-the-top presentation that is expected of Hibachi, but seemed, personality wise, to either be new at it or awkward. He didn't engage with anybody until he did a party trick and then reverted back into his shell. Poor kid as he had a very heavy accent. 

This locations gives you half noodle and half rice rather than just rice, which was interested/a nice change, but the quality/proportion of them was all off. The fried rice needed another half an egg, the noodles were half crispy half not, the vegetables was practically all onion [sigh - no broccoli] and dude, what did they do with the yum yum and teriyaki sauces? somebody needs to revisit their recipe or at least buy the good brand because it was practically just mayo with some coloring. 

Sigh it was a tad disappointing but we came on a Tuesday so it may have just been an off day, not the usual saga experience."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed. Normally, we go to Itchiban but tonight I suggested we try out Saga. Thursday evening, place was pretty dead as there was only two other families in the restaurant sitting at different hibachi tables.  They placed our menus down on the corner row of the empty table. I opted to move to the front so my son could see the show better (basically the only reason we came was for his entertainment) after sitting for 5 minutes a waiter came back with waters and placed them in front of the seats we were sitting in. He stated that we could not sit there, and we were to sit on the side, unless they did not get anymore customers at our table, and then we could move to the prime seats.... Okay then. My husband returned back from the bathroom with my son and we sat for another 5 minutes before a group of two came in and opted to sit on the smaller portion to the side. We then sat for another 5 minutes. Not once was I offered to order any appetizers, which we did want to order. At this point, I have been waiting for others to fill our table for 15 minutes. 
I ended up walking out. Lack of service and waitstaff dictating where I sit in an extremely dead restaurant. We ended up going to Itchiban. We had our order placed and appetizer order in within the first 5 minutes. I won't be back again."}
{"text":"Tuesday night, shopped at SHV mall for 1.5 hours, it's now 7:30 pm and I am HUNGRY. I did not want mall court food, and wasn't in the mood for Red Robin or BJ's.. then I remembered.. there's hibachi in this mall! Of course, I have had hibachi before, but never at this location. We were sat right away and we both ordered the chicken hibachi dinners. The salads were a little small, but still very delicious- that dressing is incredible. The soup was more like broth, but it was good! The cook was really funny & put on an amazing cooking show for us. We were both laughing & really got a kick out of him. I was surprised to see our meal came with fried rice AND noodles- pretty awesome! The veggies were incredible, the chicken was tasty & the shrimp was SO good. The yum yum sauce & ginger sauce were tasty as well. Our server was really friendly & the manager came to our table after the meal to thank us for stopping by and to ask about our experience. I was overall really satisfied & happy with our meals- we have enough leftovers for two more meals! We had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Take out...  Called for take out we had a sushi night it was finished by the time I got there and the place was packed... like usual"}
{"text":"Color me surprised that Saga has such a poor rating on Yelp.  I wasn't blown over \"wowed\" by Saga, but it wasn't a bad experience at all. I went into this expecting a lot worse than I ended up getting.  (If anything, it was the other parties at our table that were woefully disappointing.  Not a lick of excitement for fire and shrimp among them.)  The \"show\" put on by our chef was pretty par for what you'll find at any hibachi place around the U.S., and he was even one of the peppier ones that I've seen at that.  The food was good, and I paid about what I expected to for steak and scallops.  The no-prices-on-the-drink menu situation was a bit sketchy, however.  Service was efficient, restaurant seemed clean.  Next time I'm craving hibachi grill, I'd like to try a Pittsburgh area restaurant that has a higher rating, just to see if it really is all that much better."}
{"text":"Today was my inaugural visit to Saga. I had heard all good things about this place, and I LOVE sushi, so I was excited to finally try it out. 

The interior of this place is beautiful! They have a hibachi section, a large front bar (which I'd assume is a great place to be on a Friday after work), and a main dining area. This is where my friend and I sat for lunch. 

I ordered an asparagus and vegetable roll and it came with a salad. I wasn't too fond of the salad or the ginger dressing that came on it. I had two bites and didn't finish it. I probably should have stuck with my original idea of adding a seaweed salad. I'll know for next time for sure to do that.

The asparagus roll was average. The vegetable roll I'd give a B-. There were a lot of Asian vegetables in there that made for an awkward taste. I left half of them on my plate.

I give my rating an A-OK because I'd love to go back and try some of their other rolls. The food overall was good, just not anything I'd order a second time around. It definitely has a great atmosphere and good service that would bring me back there and give it a second try."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but great food at Saga.  The staff is hit or miss and the manager woman is not very friendly but I don't go there for that.  Their lunch special is a great deal."}
{"text":"Definitely go here for lunch! Their lunch specials are such great deals I wouldn't even think of dining for dinner.  Their sushi is super good and they have a really good bar area. I've never sat at the hibachi tables, always to the right side of the building when you walk in but I've always had good food. They do carry out too which is good so you can order and pick it up, and the service is pretty fast!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day and the food was good. The chef did a really great job. However, I will NOT be going back and I recommend to all yelp-users to go to a different Japanese restaurant!
I called ahead about a groupon deal I saw and the manager told me they would give me the discount. Upon arriving at Saga, I wanted to verify the groupon and the man at the front desk told me once again that he would honor the deal. When we received our bill, they did not take off the groupon discount, so I asked a woman about it. She proceeded to tell me that it would not be honored, and that she didn't care. I was talked down to after asking her name and for her manager. I will never go back to this restaurant, I am in complete disbelief at the way that they treated a person who once loved hibachi food.
I would give 0 stars if I could!! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR YOUR MEAL"}
{"text":"Sushi wasn't bad, I don't order any of the special rolls just basics. Alaska roll, spicy yellow tail, and salmon skin roll. The \"spicy\" wasn't spicy at all. The clear soup was beef base, opposed to chicken base which I am used to, the beef was good, had a lot of flavor. The staff and the sushi chefs seem to clash a bit. There was a lot of \"communication\" happening with no responses. I'd eat here again, check it out."}
{"text":"Anytime I come up to PA to visit my husband we eat here. We love the Hibachi---a lot of food for the price so we don't mind in splurging. The chicken is always juicy & the steak is cooked right & taste amazing!!?Love this place!! Will deftly come back!!"}
{"text":"Last night was my last attempt to give this place a chance. We arrived at about 7pm on a Saturday night. No wait, which was nice, but we were seated and within a minute the guy is there for our drink order ok that's good right? No. He then says you order now the others are waiting. We rush to order. Now we wait. Finally here comes the guy to cook the food! No drinks, soup or salad. The cook just cooked. No entertainment at all. Literally just stood there cooking. Despite the fact that I had three kids there. It was terrible and it wasn't the first time it was terrible. All this disappointment at the bargain price of $107.00 without ordering alcohol or desserts. It was me and 3 kids. Such a shame"}
{"text":"This is where we go when we have large groups of people. You can't beat the large group atmosphere and the sake! The food (hibachi) the same as any other hibachi joint. Like the fact they started giving you low mein noodles with the dinners. 

The Sushi is GREAT, i prefer the double spicy roll, or the dragon roll. But the saga roll is perfect for first timers to the world of sushi. 

They have cut back on there sake selection, which bums me out, but is better for me the next morning.

*jedi certified *"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. I am not a negative person, but this restaurant I am sorry is horrible. Being a prior restaurant owner and in the field for years, I know that customer satisfaction should be above all else. They have never met or exceeded expectations. I have tried to give the benefit of the doubt as I have done with other places. The hibachi is okay at best. I have had it twice. The front waiter restaurant service is horrible. They are not friendly nor do they offer an attempt at good service. I have never had a good experience, either the food wasn't cooked properly, the food was cold or lacked flavor or taste. It is never crowded when I have gone, and see no reason for the service to be as poor as it is. The sushi was never wrapped tight enough and fell apart with the chop stick. The soup has been cold or luke warm at best.  The tea lacks taste all together. I am sure others have had a great experience and enjoy the place. I do not recommend this place nor will I return. My recommendation would be Yoko's in the Waterfront in Homestead."}
{"text":"Finally a hibachi restaurant where I don't constantly sit in a state of red alert, fearing being impailed by an escaped steak knife. These hibachi artists are highly skilled. You would think that all Asians would be naturally gifted with the ability to twirl knives but unfortunately, it's not always true. I literally think these guys could cook my meal with Nunchucks. The service is the combination of a resort day spa and a Chinese message parlor. Hand and foot, head to toe. Just the way I like it. And the sushi, oh the sushi. Sushi here is like witnessing a miracle. The first bite feels as if I just watched a kitten run into a burning building and carry an infant out on its back white carrying an American flag in the mouth. Pretty sure I just came thinking about it. The sushi that is. I could go their everyday if my wife said we could afford it. And if I had a wife. Love saga, even if I can't  understand the accent."}
{"text":"I tried their new location in Cranberry PA off of Route 19. The decor and aesthetically speaking it is done very nicely, lots of interesting light fixtures and glass work. However the food leave a lot to be desired. I order the California roll and the spicy California roll, the only difference was the spicy had a blob of sauce on top, not mixed in with the crab like a true sushi place does. Also I ordered the combination box, with steak and shrimp. The steak had all the fat left on it and there was 3 shrimp, they try to make it up with the plate being filled with half right, veggies and noodles. The salad was the same as all, and the miso soup was relatively cold when it was brought out, also very clear and not much taste. Like I mentioned it was new, but a decent lunch crowd, however wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Went for a relatives birthday dinner. I've been to several hibachi  style restaurants over the years, and normally enjoy them, so my review may be somewhat skewed in favor of this type of restaurant.  

The vibe of the place is unique.  The front bar area has a decidedly club feel.  Dark Blue lighting and club music.  I sat at the bar for a while as I waited for my party to arrive and was thrown off by the venue.  The bartender was an attractive female but probably the least friendly bartender I've encountered as far as engaging in conversation.  I tried to start up something but couldn't get anything going.  So essentially I wouldn't recommend this place as a venue to grab a drink. 

Once in the dining area the restaurant is nicer.  While it is dimly lit, the decor is much nicer than I expected for a place in the mall.  

I got the shrimp and lobster.  I enjoyed my meal although the lobster wasnt the best I've ever had, but then again, I wasnt paying top dollar for high end lobster.  

The chef was great.  Very entertaining and skilled.  He was also a big fan of squirting sake into patrons mouths with a squirt bottle.  

It ended up being a good time and I enjoyed the place.  We had a coupon that was from the Clipper magazine for 10% off, so keep your eyes peeled for those."}
{"text":"Folks, I am here to tell you that I was impressed with this place!  It is not everyday a mall sushi joint gets this kind of praise!  A customer picked this sushi joint out and when we pulled up, I was like \"oh boy, this should be interesting\"

Getting past the mall issue, the restaurant is nicely decorated in the usual oriental stuff.  Friendly staff and very clean.  Nice sushi bar with a very large plasma flat screen.

Now for what rocked me.  The sushi was terrific, fresh and the presentation was awesome.  I cannot tell you the last time I tapped out of a sushi meal.  But these rolls were large, like large to the point, some at my table actually had to cut them in half.  I on the other hand shoved it all in my mouth :-).  The nigiri was like a fillet!  LoL, normally Unagi, Tuna, Salmon are bite size, well people, these cuts were fillet size, friggin large as hell.  I ate so much that I was kind of ill......  Note:  this is a good thing.

A couple of us had the hibachi, which was excellent too.  

To bad, I do not visit Pittsburgh all that often, I could get used to eating at Saga!!!!!"}
{"text":"The filet minion at the hibachi table is to die for. It's absolutely delicious. The meat is so tender and then they cook it right in front of you. It tastes so good. Also the vegetables are so good!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the sushi and sashimi combo for lunch. The fish was good, but I was very turned off by the cleanliness of the plate it was served on.  Almost like they forgot to put enough soap in the dishwasher. It was disgusting. I should have refused the food.. Not sure why I didn't.

I will not be back"}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty amazing, and the avocado salad was great too! The reason I gave Saga a lower rating was because of the cleanliness of the place. It was a very nice looking restaurant, but wasn't as clean as I thought it should be. We sat at the sushi bar, the counter and the place mats were dirty and sticky. The floor was filthy, in much need of a good polishing. The bathroom especially was the worst, soap residue was on the wall, the garbage can was filthy, along with everything around it, also the paper towels were out too. That was pretty disappointing, being that the look of the place was nice. Someone needs to make those hostess check the bathrooms and clean them a little more often."}
{"text":"Typical Hibiachi/Sushi fare. Not bad, but the tamago is kinda waterlogged and was obviously frozen which is always a let down; thr inari had a weird flavor and basically fell apart. The most annoying thing is the language barrier, at least it was for my table, but the service was friendly non-the-less. This place is nothing special, it is typical mall food only a wee bit fancier. It'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"I come to saga all the time and I am literally obsessed with the sushi, however tonight's experience was absolutely awful. I was 10 minutes late meeting friends who had already sat and ordered for me. When I got there our server, Jay i believe never even asked me if I wanted a drink. He was so rude and would drop things off and literally just walk away as fast as possible. Never asked how anything tasted, never checked for refills and honestly was really rude with us. When we paid, he ended up bringing back all of ours and directly said to us \"you have to tip more\" then stood there and watched all of us awkwardly dig more money out for his service, staring the entire time. So awkward and literally awful service. Not to mention the sushi wasn't what it usually was. They just didn't care I guess. I'm probably gonna switch to ichiban for a little lol."}
{"text":"Was treated very rudely by an employee there,she charged me for extra stuff I asked for then when I got home I realized I didn't get it so when I call back she was very ignorant"}
{"text":"Great service and ambience.  Some of the better sushi in Pittsburgh (for a chain store!)."}
{"text":"Food tastes good,  but portions could be bigger for the fare.  Wait staff was very good and professional.  We were able to sit right down which is not common for a Friday night."}
{"text":"I don't usually enjoy hibachi,  but my hubby and his friend wanted to go to dinner,  so we found ourselves here.  We arrived before the friend and decided to have a drink at the bar.  We sat there for 10 minutes prior to the bartender even making an appearance behind the bar. By that time I was already annoyed. 

Our friends joined us,  so we sat at a hibachi table.  The waiter took a few minutes to get our drinks and orders. He promptly brought our salads,  then soups.... Then he disappeared for quite some time. A few other people joined the table (thank goodness because they don't start cooking until so many people are at the table). 

Despite the fact that people joined the table,  it still took a good 30 minutes for the chef to come out and start cooking.  He was friendly & humorous. The food was tasty.  During the chef cooking,  our waiter was M. I. A.... even though everyone needed refills. He actually didn't show up until everyone was nearly finished & needed boxes. 

The price of the meals is ridiculously over priced for what it is.  You can go to a Chinese buffet and get the same thing and then some for MUCH less. 

I visited the restroom before we left.... I was disgusted!  So dirty! Yuck!! 

I may be back, but not by MY choice.  There are other,  better,  cheaper,  cleaner places to eat."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE. Service sucks, food sucks and it's pricey for the quality of food that you're getting. I came here a couple of times but kept telling myself to give it another change. Needles to say, this restaurant stinks. We came here on a Tuesday night since we were around the area and I was in a mood for sushi. According to them, it's up to 50% off overpriced sushi. I ordered three rolls: tuna roll, shrimp tempura and yellow tail. We also ordered an udon soup. The sushi came out first. These were the SMALLEST sushi rolls that I've ever gotten. I finished all three rolls before my friend's udon came out. I usually have two rolls and I'm good but I was still so hungry after this. Like I mentioned their rolls were extremely small. The udon came out later and it was awkward as i was done eating and my friend was just starting.  The waiter barely came to attend to us and I had to flag him down to get our check. I was extremely disappointed in the overall experience.  The food tasted bland and it was mediocre.  I will NOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a good dinner at sushi bar tonight. Everything was tastey and artfully decorated."}
{"text":"WARNING: This restaurant fraudulently added an extra $2 tip onto my credit card. I prefer eating at an establishment that hires honest employees, not people like TONY who decided that a $5 tip wasn't good enough for him.

My server's name was TONY and I ate at the restaurant on 10/28/11. 

For the record, this is the SECOND time in less than two weeks that a restaurant in Pittsburgh added an additional tip onto my bill. I have never before been in such a dishonest town in my life.

Avoid this restaurant if you value honest employees with integrity. Eat at this restaurant if you don't mind wasting your time filing a dispute with your credit card company. Be sure and KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place another shot to celebrate my birthday dinner after having a miserable experience with the staff during a prior dining. 

We came in late on a Sunday night to a pretty dead place with only two other groups in the restaurant. This time round we decided to try Hibachi and were promptly seated by a friendly waiter who paid great attention to us all through the dinner service (different from my previous visit).

Our Hibachi chef had a bizarre sense of humor as his idea of showing us a good time entailed throwing pieces of food and sake at us. I did not particularly appreciate this as everyone at our table was well dressed for our night out and the oil stains on the clothes wasn't something we were looking for. 

The food this time round was decent..nothing to rave about. We got the hibachi dinner which started off with the soup and salad followed by an entree of your choice. The entree came with fried rice and noodles both equally oily though the fried rice was tastier. I got the chicken and shrimp entree which was good. My husband got the steak which wasn't the best and my mom the salmon which she liked.

Overall though I had a better dining experience, the food did not hit the mark with my taste buds. This leaves me to contemplate if I should give this place a third attempt or cut my losses and look for a new culinary experience."}
{"text":"This is my spot after going to see a Movie! I love the Saga chain because they will serve you Hibachi and you don't have to be part of a Party or Hibachi table to get served that succulent meat! Its Sushi is Above Average along with A wide variety of mix drinks makes this a perfect Movie - Dinner Date spot!"}
{"text":"Being the third best sushi/Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh is pretty decent.  Being the third best sushi/Japanese restaurant in Robinson Township, however, is less so.

After a long hiatus, my friends and I returned to Saga for lunch.  It was VERY busy.  I suppose that should say something about it, and to be completely fair, Friday during lent probably didn't help.

The waitress was polite but overworked, so she spent a lot of time apologizing for how long things were taking.  And for not having napkins.  And for not bringing soy sauce.  

The sushi was actually pretty good.  But it's just as good at least two other places within a 2 mile radius, so it'll probably be another long hiatus before my next visit."}
{"text":"Around $18 for a chirashi bowl - I thought this was a good deal even though my chirashi didn't come in a bowl. Inside my rice was shaped into a giant ball on the side if my rectangular dish. The rice wasn't quite right either - I'm not sure they got the sugar/vinegar ratio quite right. If you're a sashimi person this still might be a good place to come for the generous slices of fish!"}
{"text":"My favorite Hibachi place in the South Hills!  Sushi is also good. Cooks are entertaining and my kids love to go here. Good service and very friendly!Also, good happy hour prices. The closing was not true!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting restaurant.  You can sit on the hibachi side (where you sit through the chef's \"show\" of cooking your food and being cliche with the onion volcano, or you can sit on the other side of the restaurant near the bar/sushi bar and have a more intimate and quiet experience.

The booths look like they are about to call apart.  There are throw pillows on them to cover the holes.  The waitress said they are replacing the booths \"soon\" but they said that the last time I was in the restaurant about two months ago.  The hibachi side is loud and you will be seated with strangers.  The other side is a bit quieter but isn't overly appealing.

The menu has several pages of options.  Appetizers, sushi and sashimi, hibachi dishes (you can order hibachi entrees on the non hibachi side) and other entrees.  I've had sushi, hibachi and non hibachi entrees here.  Most have been decent, but not extremely memorable.  They do have great presentation, though.  Most entrees come with a small salad and miso soup.  Neither are overly exciting but are a nice start if you are hungry.  

Servers are friendly, but they often have a very limited understanding of english, so it can be a challenge if you have questions about the menu or a request that isn't standard.  

Watch for Groupon or Living Social deals as they often have them and you can basically get half off.

Overall it was enjoyable, but not my favorite hibachi experience in the Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Always quick and orders are always perfected. Sushi is always fresh and hibachi is made with love. Whether dining in or take out I'm always pleased. Love the location. Parking on a Friday or Saturday night is a little tricky so come early!!"}
{"text":"Super birthday dinner! Went with a very large groups, and I think this is the key to a great meal at SAGA.   Great food,  great service, excellent hibachi chef.  Spike was his name???   More sake, more sexy.  I recommend this place highly"}
{"text":"My first time visiting, and I really enjoyed it. 

Sitting on the hibachi side of the restaurant, our check averaged out to about $35 a person, with an appetizer and a round of Sake.

The waiter was absolutely awesome.    The chef was very nice as well.    The food was outstanding.

This is the kind of place to go when you want to be social and interact with people.   They will sit you with people you don't know, and the chef will be talking to you and trying to entertain you while cooking your food.

I don't think I'd be a regular here, just because of the costs.  But, this is certainly a place I would re-visit on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Saga is a good place to hangout and also their service and food is good. I am a loyal and repeating customer with zero complaints."}
{"text":"The worst sushi we've ever had. I'd even venture to say that the \"sushi\" available at Chinese buffets exceeds this sushi in quality. We were extremely disappointed in the maki. Too much rice and a strange filler of imitation crab and mayonnaise? The fish seems low quality. If this is someone's idea of great sushi, I feel very sad."}
{"text":"Eh okay food. I would have to say for the price it's really not worth it. It's cool they cook the food right in front of you but that's about it. Service isn't the greatest. But it is what it is."}
{"text":"I loved my tempura shrimp with its coconut crunch. The Osaka rolls were to die for as well. Love the clubby, hip interiors too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here when traveling for work. Had the shrimp tempura which was good and the portion was huge by the time they added in all the veggies (also came with salad, miso soup, and rice). Additionally I had a philly role which was fine. Prices seems pretty reasonable for what it was and given other alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"Our group of 3 were staying at the hotel across the street and were planning on eating at a different restaurant until we realized it was in the food court.
Lucky for us!
We all enjoyed a variety of apps, sushi and the Hibachi and everything was great.
I travel quite a bit for business and this was one of the better experiences I've had in a while."}
{"text":"This has got to be hands down the best sushi I have had in Pittsburgh. They have a great happy hour 7 days a week (available in the bar only). I went twice last week because I just couldn't get enough. On the first visit, I had a selection of sushi and seaweed salad, and on the second, I had a kitchen entree in the dining area (not hibachi station).

The Y2K roll is just divine. It has tempura shrimp (the shrimp was fresh, crunchy, and still warm when the roll arrived to me), minced spicy tuna on top, and it's drizzled in eel sauce. It is just so so good. 

The spicy California roll is the freshest tasting sushi roll I've ever had, and the spicy sauce on top is out of this world.

The seaweed salad is also the freshest-tasting seaweed salad I have had, and it is not completely drenched in sesame oil as some can be.  I got a rather large portion of it (about the portion of a standard side salad). 

The Shogun Chicken meal comes with clear soup AND a side salad with awesome ginger dressing, with a side of white rice as well. The chicken is supposed to mimic general tso's chicken; it was a bit different and not as spicy, but delicious nonetheless and a very large portion size. I decided to upcharge my rice to fried rice, whose portion is also a bit larger, and I ate the entire dish of rice, forgetting about the chicken entirely. Whoops. :)

Don't write this restaurant off just because it's in a shopping mall. The decor is beautiful, the happy hour is great, the employees are very friendly and very much on top of things, and the price is not bad for how much food and freshness you get in your meal. Also, no need to visit the hibachi; I think it's a bit weird unless it's a special occasion, as all items are available in the dining room and taste just as hot and fresh off the flat-top."}
{"text":"Terrible sushi! Unless you like cream cheese in it - the bartenders attire was not
Appropriate and when she started using the Fbomb while flirting with the frat boys - it was my time exit"}
{"text":"Without question, THE BEST sushi I have EVER had!! The hubs and I stopped in for dinner a couple nights ago, and we ordered 3 rolls to share, and each one was amazing! We usually like one more than another,  or maybe don't quite care for one.. but this night, we loved all 3. We ordered the Saga Monster Roll, the Rocking Volcano and the Phoenix.. and they were so so good! Our service was good, as well. One thing I love about getting sushi is that you can typically get in and out pretty quick, and this was no exception. We were seated immediately, served promptly, and of course, loved our food!"}
{"text":"Sorry that this isn't a food review but more a employment problem. I worked there for 3 weeks as sushi chef. I didn't get my full paycheck when I leave this position. I got a bus to catch up to New York, and they were stalling on my final pay roll. I call my boss for answers, but Boss won't pick up the phone, and send a messager over to deliver the pay check instead. Leave me no place fight for my pay check, i have to sign and take the money even that isn't full amount. ;(     Be ware, and hope someone can do about it."}
{"text":"I've been to several Saga's. This one is closer to where I live, and I've been to the one in South Hills whenever I decide to meet family, friends, shop, etc. The Saga at the South Hills Mall is FANTASTIC! This location is Average. 

The restaurant is always dirty, and the sushi the last couple of times has only been average. The raw fish tastes warm, not fresh which alarms me.

The hostess's aren't enthusiastic. I've seen inappropriate gestures of the people working at the bar. The waiter we had last time was really nice and friendly though. 

I should have realized that we should go somewhere else or to a different location the past couple of times when its dead on a Friday or Saturday night. I do not recommend this location, definitely try the others!"}
{"text":"Great service. Wonderful show by chef. Food was delicious. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"We went for my friend's birthday.  Had reservations for 7pm.  We didn't get seat until 7:30.  Sat there for 20 minutes before they finally took our drink orders.  They come back with our waters and pops but those who ordered alcohol had to wait another 20 minutes before their drinks came out.

But even before seating, we walked into the lobby and the Our feet stuck to the floor.  No idea why, but the floor was extremely sticky.  And when we sat down, the chairs moved so easily on the floor due to the layer of oil on the floor.

But finally, an hour and 15 minutes after our reservation, we ordered our food.  The food was good, and the performance was adequate, I've had better, but it wasn't bad.  Chef was friendly and nice enough.  Just nothing that wowed my socks off.

Overall, very disappointed in the over all experience."}
{"text":"Not impressed with food quality or taste. Just not what I'm used to with a moderately priced hibachi restaurant. The spicy roll entree that my husband ordered was absolutely disgusting. Minced fish mixed with spicy sauce was a gross consistency. My hibachi steak was tender and flavorful but the rice and overcooked noodles were nasty. Got suckered by a Groupon, would rather pay full price for a good meal..."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Eat there all the time.  If you like special rolls, try the Saga Monster Roll.  My favorite.  Fun time at the hibachi table. Great for a birthday gathering.  They make it very fun.  Love the staff."}
{"text":"Tonight I was treating my family of six to Hibachi and Sushi dinner. We have visited Saga on multiple occasions with success. Tonight was another matter. five of us ordered Hibachi one ordered Sushi. The Hibachi was delivered no incident, the Sushi still hadn't arrived after 20 minutes. Lots of apologies from our server Nikki but no results. I finally asked for the manager. Ray the bartender/acting manager dropped by. More apologies and finally my dinner. He was offering 10% off of the bill for our inconvenience. Any more discount would require the owners approval. They have him the authority to discount by 25%. Ray and Nikki did all that they could. Shame on the non-present owners for the disrespect to their diners. Understaffed and undertrained."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times for the hibachi , normal dine in, and take out. The food here is superb, sushi is great and in a great size. Great decor inside. Comfortable waiting seats. The timing is not long, it's just about right. The hibachi is a unique experience from other places I've been. From my experience, the chef will interact more with people like tossing food to aim at your mouth, or squirting sake out of a toy child's mouth. If you're shy, it may feel uncomfortable cause they try to really include everybody at the table. Very unique. However, my only negative concerns is that the front staff occasionally doesn't understand English well, which is fine, but due to misunderstandings , has messed up our orders a few times. They do promptly understand however and will give you what you correctly ask for which is great service. Also I don't like that you have to be placed with other strangers at a table. I get that the tables and grills are limited but idk, other places I've been to have a table for each guests and nobody is all placed at one table. It can be awkward and I've had bad experiences where overly drunk people just ruin the experience. Definitely recommend though this place instead of the food court if you happen to be in monroeville mall."}
{"text":"Have been eating here since it opened. Always had great service and food until last 2 times. Prior was just mediocre service, lack of attention or drink refills but food still good. The last time was Friday, my family of 4 had hibachi dinners (although in dining room not at the grill because kids are afraid of the fire). Experience was horrible! It was literally over 20 minutes before our waiter came to get our drink order. The couple that came in after us had their meals on the table before our drinks were ordered. Our meals were good quality but the service or lack there of was disappointing for a meal over $100. The wait was so long that we accidentally broke a soy sauce container that fell off our table onto the floor. The waiter literally came over and stared at it for 15 minutes before a young bus boy came from the back room with a broom/mop and the waiter stopped him from cleaning it until he threw newspaper on it! I swear the waiter seemed high on drugs. Then to top it off the waiter added an \"automatic gratuity\" saying that was their policy for party of 4 or larger. Dining here with always 4 guests sometimes 9 we've never had \"automatic gratuity\". I'm afraid we will not be back with service like this!! Oh and PS-they we not busy. It was off peak time and only 2 other people in dinning room with only 2 grills going."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the food at Saga. Good sushi, good food from the hibachi table, and great sauces (yum yum sauce!). We like to come to the south hills village location on Tuesday for half price sushi night. 

However, the servers are usually crap. If I could rate the food higher and the servers lower, I would. But I settled on 3 stars. The fact that some of the servers speak limited english is irrelevant... They are just plain forgetful. I ask for some yum yum sauce.... They come back without it. Remind them two or three times on a not busy week night before it shows up. We had one occasion where I ordered sushi, soup, and rice. Got and ate my sushi and soup and didn't see the waitress again until she delivered the check. I asked her if she would like to bring me the rice I ordered and was charged for. She just giggled and asked if I still wanted it. 

Another trip our food was dropped off and she never once checked on us, we had to flag someone else down to get drinks refilled. Something being wrong or forgotten due to a server error has happened almost every trip. Obviously we return because we like the food, but the servers suck."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, but not great.  It is a good place if you don't want anything extra ordinary.  We had a good date night there.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Sushi was excellent and service was prompt. I have been to this location multiple times and I am never disappointed! Wonderful half price sushi selection on Monday evenings."}
{"text":"We went out on a Tuesday night for a close friends birthday.  We had a Groupon (photo attached) for two meals for $12.  We asked the waitress what all was covered under the Groupon, and she said any adult entree was included. We were with a party of 6, and they said we could use two.  The six of us were crammed in the middle of a table with two other couples on either end.  One of the couples was cool, they interacted with the chef and us and the other party. The other man was a typical yinzer, and continually dropped the 'f' bomb in front of our mixed company. 

Three of us ordered the shrimp and steak, and the other three chicken.  The chef was good.  He was personable, interacted with all of us with out being intrusive.  The waitress was a bit huffy, and seemed perturbed that we weren't drinking alcohol. She did keep our glasses fairly full.

Our night took a substantial downward tumble when the bill came. Suddenly, the two meals for $12 became $25 off per groupon.  

We questioned the waitress, and she said that though the groupon shows two meals for $12, it was a $25 credit for $12.

We asked to see a manager and a young man named Chris came to the table.  We showed him the groupon, and he said that we had to 'read the fine print.'  We did that with him at the table.  No where did the groupon state that it was a $25 credit for $12. 

We asked him who his supervisor was, and he mentioned Stephen Chen.  He was unable to be reached by phone. The 'manager' excused himself and returned after a few minutes.  He said he spoke to Jason, the kitchen manager, and he said that no further discount could be given.  Chris also said that if we didn't pay the bill, they'd call the police.  

We never said we weren't going to pay. We just wanted the discount that was advertised on the groupon we purchased.

We reluctantly paid the bill and requested that the 18% gratuity be removed so we could pay it in cash.  The waitress huffed away as the 'manager' rang up the bill.

We asked to speak with Jason the kitchen manager and we were told he would not come out to see us.  Never again, Saga. Bait and switch is an old school sales ploy, and we're on to it.

When I showed the Groupon, live on my phone to Chris, he said 'it doesn't matter what it says, this is what it means....' He also said that what Groupon puts on their site isn't his responsibility....

We found four other groupings that showed exactly what they were (pay $15, get a $40 credit).  Photos attached of those, also. 

Finally, there are no lights in the bathroom.... Just a dark blue hue from the men's room. It's like a Miami Vice crime scene.

These hibachi restaurants are a dime a dozen.  Pick. Different one."}
{"text":"Saga Hibachi is one of my favorite places to go. The hibachi chiefs are very funny, and they even poke fun at themselves from time to time. They really go out of their way to engage and entertain the customers. I generally order the Traditional Chicken Hibachi which costs $18. It is served with chicken, rice, noodles, and mixed veggies. As a big-guy, with a big appetite, rest assured that you will have plenty of food on your plate. 

This is the first place I have ever ate sashimi. Please note that sashimi is plain raw fish. It is not sushi - it is not wrapped into rolls, mixed with rice, or any of that stuff. It is simply raw cuts of fish. I have become a big fan, especially the tuna sashimi. If you have never tried it, spend the $5 next time you are at Saga. 

Great atmosphere, lots of fun. Prices are high, but you get a great deal of food, plus entertainment...so well worth it. 

Parking can be a challenge. I usually park BEHIND the restaurant and simply walk through Barnes and Noble to get there.

4 Stars for sure...Great Place!"}
{"text":"Rating is only on the Hibachi table dining experience:  
- Servings were smaller than some of the other hibachi places.  It seems every time we go to one of these restaurants, the veggie and meat portions get smaller. 
- The chef was more entertaining than some of the other restaurants, although each of the 'surprises' are more predictable at every single place. It has a WOW factor if you've never been to one of these hibachi restaurants. So, how about changing it up guys?  
- Not sure if I like the fact that the chef used the same utensils on beef, chicken and shrimp without wiping off his utensils at all.  
- Best Value:  If you were having a birthday celebration (and I am only referring to those old enough to consume alcohol) then this might be a very entertaining placed to have that birthday bash. Gather about 10 people to sit around your table.  Then \"Get Ready, Set.....Open your mouth!\" The chef will take his sake in a squeeze bottle and squeeze it into your mouth from about 3 feet away while saying, \"More Sake, More Handsome\" and \"More Sake, more babies\" and other sayings.  
All observed from a neighboring table. But then our chef asked our table if we wanted some, also. Only one couple participated. But as he was leaving, he made sure to stop at the party table to offer sake a la squeeze bottle too. All we could say was that we hoped the party had a designated driver with the amount squeezed into their mouths.   
- Clean restrooms were a plus. 
Recommendation:  Good for parties and that first time WOW factor if you've never been to a hibachi steakhouse."}
{"text":"Fun place to take kids.. Or a friend u really don't like.. But u feed them with a long spoon  lol but naw kewl... Place check it out my yelpers"}
{"text":"Pluses: Monday & Tuesday half off Sushi after 4, open till 10, I'm not here that often but still treated like a regular, I really like the Udon Soup, Noodles, special sushi (like the boat for two, Amazing Tuna Roll, sashimi), beautiful dining room and separate hibachi area, separate segment party room and bar. Tempura is really good, I need to try the hibachi sometime.
Cons: as you can see, the regular sushi ($3 for 1 roll 6 pieces) is a little small, but reasonable for the price. Get more than one to be full! On my plate, I have two rolls plus a chef's special roll, I feel that it's a good amount of food for $14"}
{"text":"At first I really liked this place, its pretty inexpensive I once bought 8 people dinner and drinks and was pleasntly surprised how cheap my bill was, but after eating yokoso its game over for saga.  compared to other places their sushi is subpar and their hibachi is just loaded with soy sauce."}
{"text":"As a singular diner, I find that it is often rare to get a booth all to myself. But, after a few eye lash bats, I got one, so the two stars above go to the super rad host who seated me. However, after I sat down I was overwhelmed by the smell of old, stale bleach and the table was sticky. But after walking around the mall with an intense sushi craving, I let it go and looked at the menu with an open mind.

First of all the lunch specials are not honored on the weekends, which even confused my waiter. So I went with an eel maki roll (cooked) with cucumber and avocado with a salad & ginger dressing on the side. The rolls were ok, kind of on the warm side.

The overall vibe here is pretty generic- I will most likely not return."}
{"text":"To paraphrase a girl of Delta Gamma, \"tie yourself down to whatever chair you're sitting in, because this [review] is going to be a rough...ride.\"

To help keep track of everything, I've recreated my mental diary from the evening.  An asterisk indicates an approximate time (though events are in the correct order).

6:58 - Arrive for 7pm reservation

7:01 - Entire party arrives (they only seat complete parties)

7:09 - After 8 minutes of waiting, our party of 7 gets seated at a hibachi station.

7:10 - Another party of 4 gets seated at our table. Both parties are celebrating a birthday; we bond.

7:12 - I marvel at the next table. Looks awesome. Everyone's laughing at the chef's jokes as he flips bits of food through the air into peoples' mouths. Later, I'd note sake-squirting and other fun, interactive tricks.

7:13 - ANNOYING ELECTRONIC BIRTHDAY SONG LOUDLY PLAYS FOR SOMEONE IN THE RESTAURANT

7:16* - Drink and appetizer orders taken. WAITRESS OFFERS ALCOHOL TO TEENAGE GIRL. When confronted with the girl's true age and the lack of carding, waitress gives a giggle-shrug and says \"Oops! Well, you look 21!\" Oh, she LOOKS 21. Then it's fine.

7:18* - Drinks come out in Styrofoam cups. They're out of glassware. No biggie.

7:19* - ANNOYING ELECTRONIC BIRTHDAY SONG LOUDLY PLAYS FOR SOMEONE IN THE RESTAURANT. Also, we place dinner orders (though we kind of have to shout, why is the volume so loud?).

7:30 - Appetizers arrive. One of the three orders was wrong. Someone orders a second beer which never arrives, though it takes a while to figure that one out.

7:33*, 7:35*, 7:40*, 7:42*, and 7:45* - ANNOYING ELECTRONIC BIRTHDAY SONG LOUDLY PLAYS FOR SOMEONE IN THE RESTAURANT. Holy crap, this must be THE place to celebrate a birthday!

7:50 - Still no sign of our hibachi chef. Party that came in more than half an hour after us gets a chef.

8:04 - Someone complains to a waitress. We're getting hungry and rather pathetic looking. The hunger mixed with constant repetitive electronic music has worn down all my emotional defenses. I am psychologically primed for cult recruitment, or a Guantanamo interrogation.

8:07* - BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP. An alarm is going off! What does it mean? No staff is in sight. It's too quiet to be safety-related. It sounds like...an alarm clock? I hunt down the noise and find a lone iPhone sitting under a plastic bag. I pick up the offending device and ask whose it is. NOW I've got someone's attention, because a staff member rushes over and says it belongs to a coworker. She scurries off to find said coworker.

8:10* - Kid in a tie comes over and apologizes for the delay without making eye contact. No introduction, so I just *assume* he works there. He says there was a mix-up with their paper ticket system and a chef went to the wrong table. A hasty retreat is beaten by the bearer of bad news.

8:15 - Been sitting without a chef for over an hour. Contemplating leaving, but it's just so amusing th--BEEP BEEP BEEP. There's that iPhone again.

8:20* - Someone finally notices two paid checks that have been sitting on our table since we sat down. They, along with some dishes etc. get removed. I'm no logistics expert, but I think I know why they ran out of glasses and had to use Styrofoam.

8:25* - ANNOYING ELECTRONIC BIRTHDAY SONG LOUDLY PLAYS FOR SOMEONE IN THE RESTAURANT

8:39 - A chef today! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! Rejoice this way!

8:39 to 8:43 - Chef performs uninspired and perfunctory hibachi show. No throwing food in mouth. No jokes or laughter. No squirting of sake or tossing of shrimp. He bounces an egg on a spatula for a few seconds and then stores it in his hat. Awkward and boring.

8:44 - Chef starts dumping food on our plates. Show's over, he's just cooking now and ignoring us completely. My mouth hangs open--mostly from stunned disappointment, but in part out of some naïve hope that a shrimp is coming its way. No such luck. If I want food in my mouth, I'm going to have put it there myself. Like a sucker.

8:45 - We all eat quickly. Food's unremarkable; mine's a little overcooked. Too hungry to care. It's been over an hour and a half since we sat down.

8:50* - The birthday girl in the other party gets a treat! They bring out some fried ice cream just for her! ELECTRONIC MUSIC, OBVIOUSLY.  I point out that it's my friend's birthday too, so they go off to find another dessert.

8:51* - After a solid minute of confusion, the birthday girl gives up on her treat. Why? No utensils.

8:56* - MORE MUSIC, and my friend gets ice cream. Still no utensils. He uses a fork.

9:02 - Checks arrive. We found the missing beer! It's on the bill.

9:03 - Hey, wait a second. Why are the birthday treats no one ordered on the bill? They charge people having birthdays for stuff that comes out automatically. Not cool.

When the dust cleared, they took 15% off the bill. I still felt pretty disappointed and ripped off.

Oh, and 2 out of 7 people got food poisoning later that night. Don't order steak."}
{"text":"Had my first Hibachi experience last night here. Amazing food!! We had an amazing chef! And Amazing Manager!! The only thing we weren't happy with was our server! She forgot to order our appetizer , she didn't understand 95% of what we said and I was late to sit down at the table and she stood over me rushing me to order food and beverage! I told her it was my first time there and she didn't understand she basically picked my dinner for me cuz she didn't understand I needed a few minutes to look at the menu! And she messed up people's checks at the end she was a hot mess!! Everyone else was really really friendly and we had a great time celebrating our friends birthday there! Deff will be back in the future!!! Hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"My fiancé's boss took us all here last night. The only rude hiccup they had was when we walked in at 9:25 and they said we could only be seated if we ate and were gone by 10.
Our waiter was super nice and the food came quickly. (Probably because they were trying to kick us out). The sushi we ordered was pretty good.

Pro tip: If you are easily spooked, do not go to the bathroom alone. I walked in and it's literally lit by just a black light. No no no."}
{"text":"What. A. Night. (And I don't means that in a good way). We had a large group. The person who planned this night had called ahead and reserved the party room for 7pm. We were there and waiting to be seated. We waited and waited and waited.  An HOUR later we were told that when you reserve a table/room they only hold it for FIFTEEN minutes. They said since our whole party wasn't there at 7, that they gave our table/room away. None of this was told to the woman when she called to make the reservation. We were not seated til 8:30!!! 
We were FINALLY seated and then waited and waited for them to take our drink order. Then we waited and waited for our drinks. Then we waited for our chef to come and make our food. We didn't eat until 9:30pm. 
Don't get me wrong . . . I like hibachi but not enough to wait 2 1/2 hours for a meal."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. Server was inattentive and not very pleasant. Saw a bug crawl on the table (and it wasn't a fly). We were so hungry and Ichiban was closed so we stayed. My steak was cooked medium (I asked for well) and the noodles and rice was just a big YUCK. So disappointed. This was the 3rd time I have been here and have it another shot but now I know I will never come back. I had so much food left over on my plate with the steak all tore in half, you think the server would have asked how things were? Nope. Worst $30 I have ever spent."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!! Waited 2 hours even with reservations!  Never once was apologized to or anything given to us.  Called 4 times to talk to a manager and was never called back.  HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"Feeling somewhat nauseous as I write this.  Very mediocre sushi rolls, horrible ginger salad, and poor service.  And believe it or not, they only have the green sodium-free soy sauce in bottles!  The sushi isn't even worth it at 50% off.  Keeping my fingers crossed that it's just an upset stomach"}
{"text":"Got hibachi and some sushi! Sushi was just OK but the hibachi was really good! The cook was really sweet and the portions were good size. Our service was a little slow but I think she was just busy! I would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but overpriced. They do give you a fair portion though but not at the price that they charge. Beer costs 5 dollars a can which is about average for the area. 
If you have time give the the hibachi a shot. It's the same gimmick at most hibachi but entertaining none the less."}
{"text":"I thought heavily about whether or not I should write a review for Saga. Typically, chain restaurants such as this, have plenty of reviews for people to choose from. However, I thought I should.

I wanted to take my family out to dinner. My entire family. Which meant, my four children, their significant others, and my four grandchildren. Yes. I realize that's quite a brood and the amount of a meal at Saga would probably be the same as a small vacation for myself. By the way, that was the decision. I was either going to go down to Wheeling Island, or take my family out, so I opted for the latter.

We were shy one person so there were only 12 of us. We fit nicely at the big table. The one problem I have with Saga and other restaurants like it, is they won't seat you until your entire party arrives. To me this is silly, I would like to have a drink and started ordering sushi so when my party arrived a few minutes late, they could've just sat right down. However, rules are rules. And we were seated at 8:20 when a reservation was for 815. Actually the table was waiting for us.

Let's start with first impressions. The hostess. While she was not negative, she was not personable. She was there to do her job and that's what she did. She would get a neutral rating of a three.

Our waitress was efficient. She moved quickly, she got all of the drink orders correctly, although I could not gauge a personality, she wasn't overly upbeat, but she was pleasant and she was a very good waitress. When she carried that tray of soup and salad, I was impressed and that tray was bigger than her. I would give her a four.

Aw, the chef, he was quite the newbie. I say this because he didn't understand the waitress' writing, or what we meant by child's meal. He was very good. Downside, he had no joking around skills, he kept missing everybody's mouth while putting in the sake, he didn't perform brilliant defeats of culinary acts, and he lit my pink sauce on fire by accident. Or, rather the serving dishes were aflame. Thank goodness my oldest son was there to crack the jokes and we all laughed and had a great time. However, whatever the chef lacked an outgoing personality he made up for in food. The best, juiciest, tastiest, food I have had at Saga yet. I used to eat there a lot. And this was the best. Steak melted in your mouth, he cooked up to perfection. The scallops he did not cutthem into little pieces like other chefs, he left them whole and they were not dry at all. In fact I gave one to my toddler grandson who proceeded to gum the scallop because it was so juicy and tender. I would give the chef, a five-star rating simply because he knew how to cook. Who needs a personality. There were 12 of us. We were our own entertainment

I try something new, if you have never tried it you must do to Tuna takaki, it was amazing. We had a round of appetizers before dinner started as well. All in all I was very pleased with my experience Saga, they know what they're doing there. I had stopped going because my last experience the food was bland. After last night, I'm willing to give it yet another try. On the bright side. Wheeling Island would've been more expensive. I made the right choice."}
{"text":"Have been to Saga several times for dinner.  Recommend starting with some sushi **excellent** and drinks at the bar.  The real thing, not California roll type of Sushi.  Have not been able to order anything other than Lobster and steak on the Hibachi.  Can't get any better than that.  IS excellent, as is the chef and staff.   Especially enjoy being sprayed by the bottle of Saki."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Japanese Steakhouse in the area.  I love going here.  Been going since it opened, and I have never had a complaint about my meal.  I have ordered steak, chicken, and had the pleasure of trying friends and family's meals.  Never have I turned my nose up to any of it.

The sushi here is amazing.  Whenever it is my birthday this is the place I want to go.  When my friend and I have our college breaks and reunite, we do it here.  Last time we ordered $90 worth of sushi and ate all of it.  

There is never a grain of rice left on a single plate when we are finished.  Always a great time, a great atmosphere, and a full stomach.  

The only problem I have is I still cannot decide what sushi roll is my favorite because they are all so damn good.  Keep up the delicious work Saga."}
{"text":"Place was exactly as one reviewer described.  We had a reservation at 8pm on Saturday night, but took over an hour to get seated.  The lights kept going on and off, not sure why, but eventually stayed on.  I really like their food and had the Double Spicy Roll and Saga Special.  Really good flavor.  Wasn't thrilled with the wait/lights turning off so I rated it a 3 star.  I have eaten at the other location in Robinson and same type of quality, but the wait was similar even with reservations."}
{"text":"We had a surprise birthday party for my sister-in-law.  A wonderful time was had by all.  The chef's put on an amazing show for us. Food was fantastic. The wait staff were warm and friendly.  The food was delicious.  The manager, Cassie, was professional and genuinely invested in the party being a success.  I would highly recommend Saga Monroeville for any party or just a fun place to go for dinner."}
{"text":"Never a bad experience here. Friendly staff. Great food. Mushroom roll is one of the best things on the menu."}
{"text":"Never.  Again.  I can't say that I was particularly enthused when my friend decided he wanted to celebrate his birthday at Saga in Robinson, but I went along with it because it was his birthday pick.  I figured we'd at least have some fun seeing some shrimp getting thrown around and having some saki getting squirted into our mouths.  Unfortunately, our experience there was nothing of the sort. 

First, we had a reservation for 7pm and our entire party of 7 people arrived promptly at that time.  We were still stuck standing in the lobby for a good 10 minutes while our table was prepared.  When we finally got seated, our server took our drink orders and returned about 10 minutes later with a tray full of styrofoam cups.  She said that they were in the process of washing some glasses.  Ok  Understandable.  Weird that a restaurant of that size and caliber would not have enough drinkware on hand, but understandable I suppose.  A while later, she took our orders which included a variety of sushi appetizers and seaweed salad.  Those came somewhat promptly, even tough one of my dining companions received a seafood salad instead of his seaweed salad.  After our appetizers, soups and salads came out, that's when the waiting started.  And the waiting.  And more waiting.   It was obvious that *someone* had forgotten about our table.  The barely post-pubescent manager came out and \"apologized\" (without making actual eye contact with anybody) saying that the chef had grabbed the wrong ticket.  

We waited over AN HOUR for a Hibachi chef to come to our table and start cooking!  I know that if you order appetizers, your food is obviously going to be slightly delayed while you have those, but an hour AFTER appetizers is just ridiculous.  The only reason I think anybody even ended up coming over was because the people sitting around the grill with us complained that they saw other diners who had come in after us and were already served and leaving the restaurant whilst we were still waiting for our chef.  

When our chef finally came out, it was the most blase, boring hibachi 'performance' I had ever witnessed.  I mean, yeah he die flip an egg into his hat and make the grill flame up, but that's about it.  No theatrics, no conversation, just cooking.  If i wanted that, I could have gone literally almost anywhere else and left the cooks in the kitchen.

Finally, when dinner was finished, and the waitress had made about a million excuses as to why everything sucked so bad, I realized that the reason they probably are lacking clean dishes and drinkware is because she hadn't taken any of our dishes away and just kept bringing out fresh glasses.   I had four empty pop glasses in front of me alone.  After a while, someone else started taking everything away.  In the meantime, one of the employee's phones was on the server station behind us and it kept going off making this alarm sound.  It did it no less than three times.  

After dinner, that awful birthday song started playing in our section (though it was a reprieve from the incessant phone alarm) and the server brought out this fried ice cream thing to the other people sitting at the grill with us (it was one of their birthday as well).  Ironically after an entire meal of nothing getting taken away, she had no silverware with which to eat this creation.  We mentioned that it was also our dining companion's birthday so they brought out another fried ice cream thing and the awful music started playing again.  What the server failed to mention when bringing out these ice cream creations, was that they CHARGE FOR THEM.  Neither us nor the people sitting with us were aware of that.  Too bad the poor birthday girl didn't even get to try it since she had no damn silverware.  I believe, that came off the bill. 

Two hours into the fiasco, it was finally the end, we were pretty unhappy with the entire experience from start to finish.  The manager did give us 15% off, but really, Saga is so overpriced as it is, the small amount we saved because the meal was so bad was not even worth it. 

On the way back home to Oakland, I had to make an emergency stop in Greentree because after all of that, the food made me sick!  I can also confirm that at least one other person in our party also go violently ill that night. 

Between the horrible service, the boring Hibachi chef, the poor management, the phone alarm that kept going of, the awful birthday music and food poisoning, I will NOT be returning to Saga.  Ever."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and the chef's add more flare than most of the carbon copy Japanese Steak houses! 

Steak was especially fantastic. 

Also sharing for the extra 9$ charge is the way to go. Too much food"}
{"text":"Warning: this review is going to be unsettling.

The food was typical hibachi food which I think is always delicious. The chef was great. Service was friendly and prompt. We saw the menu said auto gratuity for parties of four or more. We were five. So we asked. Then the waiter made a motion with his hand, waving it over his face and said, \"no that's just for black people.\"

!!!!

What!!!!!!

!?

That's all."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with my young son, my daughter and her little guy. Both the service and the food was top notch! The table side chef was both well-skilled and very entertaining...I wouldn't even think of trying his knife juggling skills. The food was prepared perfectly, as evidenced by my finicky kid wolfing down everything. The kids really enjoyed getting mouthfuls of fruit juice. The couple seated near us were also smiling at their experience.
Good time, good food and service at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"A friend and i stopped by for lunch while xmas shopping and they have fantastic lunch specials on sushi. Both of us left full and happy for only $20. Great bang for your buck. It is not in the top 3 best sushi ive had and would not pay more for it but due to its location in the mall its definitely the best choice for a quick lunch that is not fast food from the food court. I have not tried their hibachi."}
{"text":"Honestly, folks, I rather like Saga. Yes, last weekend consisted of back-to-back Asian dine-out dinners, and just like my experience in Robinson, I found that this Saga satellite is also worthy of patronage.

After FINALLY seeing \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" Kay and I stopped in and had a meal that was stone-solid and done with a flair for the dramatic. 

No, we stayed away from the teppenyaki business since we just wanted some quiet. 

It's strange how I sometimes \"complain\" that sushi usually tastes about the same whenever and wherever I have it, but it's really the best kind of \"same\" you can get. The Osaka rolls were filled with tuna, avocado, and I forget what else (these aren't on the online menu), and had crispy roe atop them. A mayonnaise-based sauce was smeared all over the plate, and I eagerly dragged each meaty, sweet seafood medallion through it, treating each piece like a pastry or piece of protein candy, relishing their oceanic flavors and juxtaposed textures, both soft and crunchy colliding in my mouth. 

Sliced and cooked with amazing precision, the Steak Teriyaki was a gorgeous, glorious medium rare and was served with exquisitely presented fruits and vegetables, including ornately cut oranges. 

The atmosphere was as \"nightclubby\" as expected, but being that this was a late Sunday afternoon, there were more families about, and at least one birthday bash was in full effect.  The service was adequate albeit somewhat cold and aloof for most of our meal, our server loosening up a bit by meal's end. 

No one can stop them now, Saga's on the loose.

And if you \"got\" the above reference, you are a fan of Canadian AOR and prog-rock and have my deepest sympathies for the current cultural landscape is hostile towards thee.

Hey, I almost ordered a Green River roll, one that would have required a more critically-correct link...

{"text":"Man, I couldn't figure out whether or not this was a Japanese restaurant or a nightclub. The only things missing were a bouncer, a velvet rope, and a cover charge. The pounding electronic polka was in full effect as was the suburban strain of the much maligned yuppie, but that's a piece of social commentary for another day...

Kay and I began with a quintet of Lobster Rolls, which included tempura lobster, cucumber, avocado, mayonnaise, lettuce, and...caviar (!). I'm not sure why I keep ordering sushi because it all tastes the same to me, unless it's atrocious, and this wasn't in the least, each ingredient adding up to make for a flavorful wad of grains, veggies, protein, and roe. And that's all sushi is; a doughy clump of...whatever-you-can-think-of that's often greater than the aggregate of its elements, isn't it? 

Wanting to avoid doing the teppenyaki thing since we weren't feeling sociable and had experienced it before elsewhere, I haphazardly chose the Salmon Katsu for my entree. Not knowing just what in blazes Katsu was, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it primarly consisted of some of the dandiest fish fingers I've had in some time. Coated in a crispy, sweet breading, the filets within were pink, juicy, and fresh. Escorting the fish was a bowl of rice and teriyaki sauce. Nooot bad at all. 

To save my salt-of-the-earth ass, I cannot remember what Kay ordered. Our day had been a protracted one, and our week had been bludgeoning, overstimulating. 

We did not *sob* order dessert. 

Aside from Saga's overly trendy climate, I really have no qualms about our Friday evening meal here.

P.S. The service was satisfactory on our end, and the restaurant was spic-and-span."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I NEVER write reviews,  but I had such a great experience at the bar. I started with a cocktail calledba lychee martini, it was the perfect balance not too sweet not too try, my boyfriend had a can of sapparo. We started with the tuna tataki. It was plated beautifully topped with avocado and tri-color tabiko, it was super fresh and melted in mu mouth.YOU HAVE TO TRY THE SEX SALMON IT IS MORE THAN AMAZING. We also ordered the crab Rangoon....they came out piping hot and they didnt skimp out on the fulling it was so so good my boyfriend jist kept burninf his mouth because he couldnt stop eating them. I ordered that fantastic roll and can see why they call it fantastic and a monroville roll which HAS everything if you like raw. My boyfriend tried and like both and hes not big not sushi. He ordered the steak and scallop hibachi.....i wanted to steal all the scallops they were cooked to perfection and so was the steak..... Both melted like butter in your mouth.  BONUS you get rice and noodles. Couldnt ask for more. Jaunice the manager is absolutely halarious and made us feel so welcomed. I would absolutely reccomend this place. !!!"}
{"text":"Really welcoming staff. Was nervous to try it out because of the negative reviews but I'm glad I did because everything was great. The menu is decent and the chef was hilarious. Overall experience was definitely a good one!!"}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant that is nicely decorated.  Some windows to the outside that let in the sun. 

The food was good.  I chose the Tempura.  The veggies and Shrimp were cooked just right.   The sushi looked good and the people eating sushi enjoyed it.  The salad that come with the meal was the typical Japanese steakhouse salad."}
{"text":"Well, another Japanese Hibachi steakhouse,  They just keep popping up like rabbits.  Wow, don't we have enough of these in the area.  They must be popular.

Very nice atmosphere.  Dark with some blue accent lighting.   Seems a little more upscale then some of the others, but that is probably just the lighting and because it is so new.  This restaurant is actually in the corner of the mall with an outside entrance next to Macy's, a little hard to find if you do not know where it is.  As the name says, there is a sushi bar, hibachi tables, some regular tables and a bar area.   

Service was real good.  Place was not crowded, probably due to just being open about 1 week.  

The food was good.  I chose the Tempura.  The veggies and Shrimp were cooked just right.   The sushi looked good and the people eating sushi enjoyed it.  The salad that come with the meal was the typical Japanese steakhouse salad, but it was prepared earlier and kept in the cooler, which can be OK, but the lettuce was to cold and almost frozen.   I thought the prices were just a little lower than some of the other Hibachi places."}
{"text":"Went to saga tonight to meet my twin sister and a couple friends.  We sat at the bar and we had the absolute best service EVER!  Erin was our bartender and not only was she incredibly friendly and personable, but she paid probably more attention to us that I'd ever received.  For instance, I had mentioned casually that I was interested in a second glass of wine at some point...before happy hour was over she asked my friends if they wanted anything and stated that she'd already put mine in.  It almost felt like Erin was just a friend hanging out with the four of us that was on the opposite side of the bar.  I should also say that the food was brought out very quickly and as always was very good.  Definitely recommend happy hour at saga south hills!!!"}
{"text":"Meh.

You can do much better for Hibatchi and Sushi at Shogun or at the Waterfront. Salad dressing is crappy and salad had only iceberg and a half slice of cucumber. 

Miso soups was a disappointment. No kombu. Very bland.

The veggie sushi platter was unimaginative and terrible. 2 avocado nigiri, 2 cuke nigiri, 3 yellow pickled unidentified nigiri, 3 brown pickled unidentified nigiri, and a roll with cuke and the two unidentified pickled veggies. No asparagus or carrot or anything interesting. No variation at all.

Hibatchi was also a miss."}
{"text":"The worst Hibachi experience ever. This place is a complete shit hole. The hostess was completely rude and she made us wait for 30 mins for no reason. They won't start making your food until the table is full. I wish there was a way to rate less than one star."}
{"text":"I've never not had a good time here! I've been several times with just another friend or two, at a booth. The servers weren't the most personable but they were attentive enough and really, we were there for the food.... which is delish! 

I've only ever had various sushi rolls and fried rice while there and it's never disappointed! 

Once we had a large group at a hibachi table sans the hibachi. Our server was organized and able to accommodate all of our separate checks and separate meal types (hibachi, sushi, etc). It was so much fun! And again, every single person was happy with their meals. 

Atmosphere is great too... not too casual but not uppity either. I'd feel comfortable going in there after running errands or still in my work clothes. 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"We cannot make a comment on the Hibachi meals or confirm that the chef delivers Triple Fire on request. 

We sit on the sushi bar side and order off the menu from there.  

This place is local to us and while its not the best sushi joint around it does have a decent noodle dish: chicken soba.   Decent because it is flavorful even though the noodles aren't soba noodles; the noodles are your typical ramen style.  But, aside from the false labeling, it is the only item I have ordered from the small selection of cooked items not from the Hibachi.  

Again, this place is okay.  The bar is not high here and if you know that going in you'll be okay."}
{"text":"We come here on Monday nights for 1/2 price sushi (starts at 4, not sure how late it runs). Somehow we always end up spending just as much as we would for regular priced. It's good and we order a ton.
We usually start with miso soup because I love it and you can't get it everywhere. It's good and I think it's $1 during happy hour!
All of the sushi we order is quality, but you should definitely try one of the pricier \"deep fried\" rolls. My favorites are the saga roll or delicious roll. They are still warm when they are served, but trust me, it's fantastic.
It seems like they have some trouble with staffing; they are always hiring someone and there isn't usually a warm greeting when you arrive. I let it slide because I really like the sushi chefs here."}
{"text":"Chef Sean was astounding. His performance on the Hibachi grill left me wanting more. The noodles were delectable as he cooked the sauce into the noodles(different from other Hibachi chefs). Not only did I feel a requirement to write this review, but it leaves me wanting to continue coming to Saga as my primary Hibachi Steakhouse. Long Live Chef Sean!"}
{"text":"Came here during my first few months of moving to Pittsburgh and the experience was pretty underwhelming. I bought a Groupon and still had to pay quite a bit over the Groupon price. The food tasted like standard Hibachi fare but the performing chef was either tired or annoyed (or both) and did not seem in a good mood to cook for the table at all. Nothing special, high prices and portions were kind of small. We took some fried rice home but the entrees were on the skimpy side. It's been 3 years since I've been there and I will probably never go for their hibachi again. I hear they have sushi specials on Monday nights though."}
{"text":"My family went there for lunch today to celebrate my sibling's graduation with her fellow classmates. Everyone got the Hibachi lunch special. I got the clear soup which was fine. It wasn't supposed to anything special. My family got the salad with their meals but none of them enjoyed the salad dressing. It was pink, creamy and completely drowned the contents of the salad. 
As for the Hibachi meals, they were decent. The meats and veggies were cooked well. However, sections of my rice was chewy. If I had paid the dinner price I may had been upset but at lunch it only costs $10. 
My family loves crab ragoons. This restaurant had some of the best ragoons we've ever eaten(and we've tried a lot).
I think my favorite part of this visit was the company I had. The chef was absolutely hysterical. I will have to go back to see if my good experience was the actual food or just the wonderful company."}
{"text":"The worst service was here today. One server and one cook. Took them 30 minutes to bring me drinks. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend out here for date night last week. She isn't into hibachi but I got her to agree if she ate sushi. We got sat with another group and we were highly entertained by our chef. He was very engaging and entertaining! My girlfriend even ordered the scallop hibachi .... and she loved it. Our server was so nice and prompt and our cocktails were cold and came right after we ordered . We will definitely be coming back! From start to finish everything was perfect!!"}
{"text":"Great food at the hibachi grill. I always get the steak and shrimp with fried rice, sushi side and a warm sake. A little pricey but fun to watch and really hits the spot. Decor is a little cheesy in the main dining area."}
{"text":"This place is good, but it is nothing special. It is also rather expensive compared to most sushi places I have ever been so this rating is a result of a bad cost/quality ratio."}
{"text":"worst.

My fiancee had never had hibachi before. So we had a date night. 

I had been to Saga one other time for sushi once for lunch and it was GREAT! So we planned to go for hibachi and then across the street to the movies. 

We sat down, ate, and it was delicious. No complaints. The drinks, the food, the show. It was awesome. 

Then... we went across the street. 

I swear to god we sat through the previews and about ten minutes of the movie before I ran to the bathroom and vomited. I also threw up in the car and at home. So did he. It was horrible.

I will say that one of my fiancee's students (he is a teacher) worked at the theater and noticed we were leaving already, told her manager what happened and refunded our tickets so we got to see the movie a few days later! they are awesome!)

Then, when my fiancee called the restaurant they told him we were lying and hung up on us!

I emailed management from their website who told me that they didn't believe their workers would do that and they would look into it. I never heard back."}
{"text":"I was in the Robinson area and saw this hibachi place. Phone was dead so I couldn't yelp, otherwise I would never be writing this review. 

Atmosphere and service were lets just say...odd. Colored strobe lights changing the ceiling color. Quads yes off in a bi ahi section vs a dining section. Just odd

So now lets talk food. Ordered a few rolls for lunch and also got the hibachi steak and chicken combo. Ginger salad came out absolutely drenched in dressing. Steak and chicken were both diced very small and steak was chewy. Food reminded me of the Chinese food court options at the mall. 

At the end of my meal, the bill came and totaled $30. Now I did get some rolls (albeit very basic ones like California roll) but still, this was ridiculous for the food that came. If it had been better quality, then fine I have no problem paying this. But it wasn't. 

Needless to say I will never go back. Can't imagine this place staying in business long. Only a few people eating there. Don't make the same mistake I did. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch. first was good it was a little greasy. but this time was awesome not to much grease at all! got shrimp tempura and brown rice. shrimp were perfectly cooked also was doubled fried which is the way to fry food. nice work! lunch deal is amazing for the portion I'm down to try them out for dinner. shrimp was the star it had an amazing crunch. also, the slaw was really nice light and crunchy also. corn carrots brocolli had a nice texture. sauce was nice wasn't to orange just right. service, was great too will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! Amazing service and the food is incredible. Perfectly cooked filet and shrimp with a delicious side of noodles, fried rice, vegetables, salad and soup. Yum yum sauce is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"I teeter on 2 or 3 stars. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't really impressed either. I love sushi, especially the spicy rolls. I was excited to see a trio of spicy salmon, tuna and yellowtail offered. I didn't understand the server when she explained it, and thought it came with around 9 pieces, but it was actually 18 pieces! Imagine my surprise at the feast in front of me! 

I didn't mind the tuna, and the yellowtail was the best, but something was off with the salmon and I only had one bite. I realize I'm eating fish, and raw fish at that, but it was a little too strong in the fishy taste, that makes me think it maybe wasn't the freshest. 

I did love that the special came with soup and a salad for a grand total of $17...  I love me some ginger dressing! The dressing was good, albeit a little watery. I was not a fan of the miso soup. It just lacked flavor.

Obviously I didn't try the habachi, and I wouldn't be opposed to trying it another time, but the sushi, I'd maybe skip or try the maki instead."}
{"text":"I sat in the bar because I wanted a Kirin and a roll while my wife and daughter were painting some pottery downstairs. I always sit in the sushi bar area of these places, because I don't go in for magic knife tricks, cooking Asian cuisine with butter, or paying $20.00 a plate for low grade Chinese takeout. I love sushi. Ok, you got me. I think Hibachi is stupid. However it does serve a purpose for people that are afraid to explore cuisine from other cultures unless it is served in a Disney ride setting. Long story short I can't speak for the sushi. Never did see a waitress.  I finished my beer and left."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to this location. We usually frequent the settlers ridge location. The service was horrible the food was inedible. We sat in the back dining room and the staff were walking around swearing at each other. I mean they were using the 'F\" word. It was terrible. The server disappeared for a half an hr no one could find her. I spoke to the manager and all she said was im sorry. This was probably the most disappointing experience I've ever had. 

Update i wrote an email to the company about the staff swearing in front of guests and i havent heard anything back from them. Not as much as a sorry. Ill never spend my hard earned money their again."}
{"text":"Place was pretty packed for a lunch hour. Food was descent but nothing outstanding. Restaurant was moderately clean. Edamame was disgusting and the glasses were dirty."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here all the time, the Sushi is awesome, especially the Saga Monster Roll and the Seaweed Salad.  Surprised more people don't come here, but I think a lot of people don't know about it.  Way better than Ichiban in Robinson, went there 3 times and had a really bad experience.  The Hibachi area is amazing and fun for all.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Well, surprisingly good hibachi place right here in Monroeville, located interestingly at the Mall.  I've been here a couple times and have tried the sushi, which is okay, but this place is all about the hibachi. I took a group of 5 here on Thursday for my sis' bday lunch.  The restaurant itself is the nicest Hibachi restaurant in terms of decor in my opinion in greater pittsburgh, despite its location (with maybe the exception of the bathroom, which looks like it should be located at the cleveland airport).  The space is very fresh with great earthtones and your customary asian images.  The seating for hibachi is pretty spreadout and the regular tables are big and comfy.  The lunch prices are reasonable for $9 you can get the chicken hibachi, with veggies, rice, sauce, salad.  You can also get a combo for $14.  The service is better than most places I've been and everyone there seems to be asian of some type and well trained unlike Nakama.  The food is fresh and the cooks are well trained.  They interact with you a little more than other hibachi joints, but they actually seem to enjoy it.  If you are in m'ville and want hibachi this is a much better option than shogun, one last thing they really make a big deal about birthdays, so if you really want to embarass someone on their bday this is the place to go.  They turn down all the lights, turn on a disco ball, have the whole restaurant staff gather round you while this super cheesy bday / disco song places in the background and the whole restaurant is encouraged to clap.  They also have this nice flower type candle for the bday girl to blow out and serve with french fried ice cream.  This is a good addition."}
{"text":"'Twas just meh for me. I felt it was very carbon copy of every other Japanese steakhouse I have been. It was actually very bland and not very entertaining."}
{"text":"I love this place. The sushi is yummy and the drinks are perfect."}
{"text":"Never going back. 
I gave this place too many chances. Today, it smelled like cat pee, every surface was sticky, it was as humid as the tropics, the waitress was snobby, and they did not know how to accommodate children. The sushi was meh. 
Done."}
{"text":"Saga can suit any sort of craving you have.  

First, the sushi.  I've stopped in at both lunch and dinner hours.  The chefs are quick, the servings are large and its all reasonably priced (compared to say, Nakama.) My favorite is their rainbow roll, but do try their daily specials. Everything is amazingly fresh! 

Second, the hibachi.  Nothing incredibly special about the presentation or food, but all combinations are fairly priced and tasty.  My personal favorite is a hibachi staple, the steak and shrimp.  After Saga hibachi, I always leave full and happy, if with a slight case of indigestion. 

Lastly, the Japanese \"dinners.\" They have several cook-to-order meals and appetizers. Their gyoza (dumplings) are some of the best I've ever had, and definitely try their noodle dishes if you haven't.

Service is (almost always) quick and friendly.  I docket them a star for a few times when service was EXTREMELY slow in the front table area. 

Otherwise, it's a great place for Japanese food despite its mall location."}
