{"text":"**Note, keep in mind this review is written in the perspective of someone who grew up in a chinese household eating chinese food for 27yrs and has issues w/o at least 1 chinese meal a week  The Bkgd -  Nearby chinese joint that BF orders from so thought I'd try out cuz  1.) To lazy to cook  2.) Needing chinese meal fix & need rice but no rice cooker 3.) Couldn't cook anywayz given no chinese produce in the fridge..  The Story - Not a bad take out joint. Def. focus on Chinese American food ..but would give it another try for their peking duck. Just too much of the same brown sauce on everything...but good portions  The Order  -- White General Tso Chicken     *  BF's fav..specific orders white meat only    *  Lots of heavy sauce and not enuf brocolli but he likes  -- Mongolian Lamb    *  Tasty but a bit too chewy for my taste;    *  Lacked the heavy cumin I'm used to for Mongolian style and just had a lot of sauce     *  Too much onion  -- Stir-Fried Chinese Veggies    *  Only \"chinese\" veggies were maybe the baby corn & water chesnut    *  Included mushrooms, lots of brocolli, greenbeans, carrots    *  Tasty but still a bit too much sauce  --  \"On the House\" Chinese Bite-Size Sugar Donuts    *  When got home surprised to find a box labeled \"On the House\" to find our free dessert    *  Not sure if its on the on the menu but it was good..basically think sugar donut holes..hot, sweet & chewy  Interesting Notes  --  Each dish came w/ choice of rice; basically got 3 med. size cartons of rice --- Provided tea bags which I thought was nice --- Really liked the plastic covered to-go containers. BF saves to re-use at home. plus! --- They do deliver w/in specific radius & at least $15 min order"}

{"text":"Just ordered foods from Hunan Inn last night and it was delicious. I got the general tso chicken with white rice and my friend got the hunan chicken. I specially requested my general tso to be extra crispy and spicy and it was amazing. It was the BEST general tso chicken i ever had. The lady who took my oder was extremely nice and pleasant. And the delivery was fast, it only took about 30mins to get my foods. Overall the foods and service is wonderful, def would order again."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Chinese place. We usually get delivery. The food is always piping hot and the delivery guys are nice! They remember the name of my young kid. The delivery is slower during peak times, but they are usually there by the quoted time.  The dishes we like from there include the vegetable lo-mein, the General Tso's, the steamed pork dumplings, the Crab Rangoons, and the \"free\" donut balls that come with orders over a certain dollar value.($40?) Other dishes like the Chicken w/ vegetables and Beef are good as well.  I don't know if there's every been anything there that has \"knocked my socks\" off, but this is very good, very consistent, and exactly what I'm looking for. We've never had a screwed up order from them.  We used to use Sesame Inn religiously, but we switched years ago after just so-so food, and slow delivery. Hunan is actually further away from us, but they get here faster consistently!"}
{"text":"Used to eat the lunch buffet here when I was younger. During that deep freeze over the holidays we didnt want to go out in it, so we decided to get take out. They do take out and deliver it !!! We order a whole bunch of food to give it a try again, which was all very good !  Steam dumplings, Lo-mein, fried rice G Tso and Sweet and Sour chicken.  Would definitely suggestion getting take out from them. Plus to top it all off they give you free asain doughnuts with your order. In closing id order take out from them again"}
{"text":"A small place, tucked away in part of a sprawling shopping plaza, this place is easy to miss. There are only a couple of small signs to show where it is. One on the facade of the building, and a handing one, in case you are walking down the side of the plaza. In any case, the signs are just an indication of how forgettable this place is.  Once you find it and enter, you will find a dark place with three rows of tables going down the depths of it. It's quite deep, and the restrooms are all the way in the back. When we came there for lunch, there were only two other occupied tables and no one from the staff. After about a minute, someone came in from the back and she motioned us to a table that was right besides a small TV/VCR setup along the back wall. The TV was loud and set to CNN, although that did not really matter. The waitress, brought up some takeout menus for us. There was no explanation of any specials (do they even have any?) or even a real menu. Each lunch special comes with soup and rice, or an egg roll. The overall menu was the absolutely standard menu you find at almost every Chinese restaurant in the country - along with the traditional spelling mistakes!  We ordered the Prawns with Shrimp and the Cashew Chicken as two traditional items that we've had in many places and could therefore compare to their offerings. We requested Hot and Sour Soup, but had to repeat the request three times before the waitress stopped saying \"Won ton soup?\" It came back from the kitchen very quickly and was lukewarm. Very beefy, but definitely not spicy or sour. We asked for hot chili sauce and this also took several attempts before it was brought. Maybe it's a sign of how rarely they use the condiment, but this stuff was very tame. Even the one of us who does not like spicy food used several heaping tablespoons before it affected the flavor of the dish. The soup did look gorgeous though, and the chopped scallions on top were great.  The same thing happened with our two dishes. They looked beautiful - but were almost completely lacking in and kind of flavor. Much to my surprise, the Cashew Chicken chicken pieces were coated and fried. The predominant vegetable was celery and the sauce can best be described as brown and salty. The prawns and chicken at least had more colorful vegetables, but there were only two small chunks of chicken breast and the sauce can only be described as brown and salty. In other words, the flavor was simply not there.  The rice options we were given included steamed or fried. When asked about Brown rice, we got an emphatic shake of the head: \"No\".  The meal was inexpensive, but that's the best thing I can say about it."}
{"text":"Whenever I order Chinese takeout I always get it from here and have never been disappointed.  They are fast and inexpensive. Best Chinese in the area."}
{"text":"This is probably the BEST chinese place in mcmurray and my favorite. I normally don't like beef dishes because they're not tender and full of gristle. Their beef is perfect! I love their Mongolian beef and chicken, delicious! Their crab ragoons are really good too. I always get \"on the house\" donuts which is fried bread dough and sugar, I haven't had these since a chinese place I used to go to in Florida. No other chinese place has them around here. Sometimes you have to wait a bit longer than normal for your food to be ready for pickup but it's always worth it. The staff is always so nice. Whenever I'm craving Chinese food this is the first place I order for takeout. You definitely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay so I don't know why there are so many positive reviews on this place because it just doesn't make sense to me. We ordered take out, so I know nothing about the actually place or the service. I will start by saying the food isn't bad, but I also won't call it phenomenal either. It's mediocre. It's basic Chinese food. The sauce is really good, and the rice was good... but the chicken- I'm not sure what it is- but the texture is off. It's like chewing on stringy mushy rubber.. that is my only real complaint. However- my boyfriend gobbled it up like it was his last meal so it must not be THAT bad. Other than that.. it's decent food if you're looking for something quick."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food with the most likable staff I've ever experienced. Best in the area! Been working our way through the menu and haven't been disappointed since.  ***Shout out to Alice for being such a great hostess.  She always makes sure my friends and I are well taken care of when we go to eat there for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese food. I stopped by for lunch because it was in the shopping plaza I was at. The restaurant was clean and the service was quick, but the food was just ok"}
{"text":"We got take out from here and was amazing. Everything was very fresh. The Crab Rangoon was very good and pretty. You can tell you that they care and took their time to be meticulous in the quality. I highly recommend this restaurant. It is our new go to spot."}
{"text":"**Note, keep in mind this review is written by a thick-around-the-middle white guy that has been eating the same dish of Americanized Chinese food for the past 20 years (a wink and a nod to Victoria's review)  So...I'm at the Homewood Suites, and it turns out that although I love the hotel, their food is crap. So I needed some takeout. Stat.  I call up and ask for what I have pretty much ordered every time I have ordered Chinese food in the past 20 years (no joke): Sweet and Sour Pork (sauce on side only please), Crab Wontons and pork fried rice.  The result? Well, although very nice, the delivery driver couldn't find my hotel...I had to help him out a little. Being that I'd only been a local for about 3 hours...I had to use google maps. Hooray technology.  So I received my food. Sweet and Sour pork? Porkballs were perfect. Sauce was...good. But where are my vegetables for the sauce? Five. Count 'em: FIVE. pieces of pineapple. No onion. No bell pepper. Meh.  Pork fried rice? A-Ok.  Crab Wontons? A fucking joke. The only way they could get less \"crab\" in them would be to not deliver them. A tiny smear of cream cheese and I'm guessing the light crab flavor may have been from crab...maybe it was seasoning. Hard to say.  I half want to give them 2 stars just because of the lame-ass wontons, but...they didn't say *crab puffs*, so I will cut them some slack. Fore warned is now fore armed. Don't expect much from their wontons.  All in all? I liked them well enough to order again. The food turned out to be enough for dinner and lunch the next day. (minus the \"wontons\")  If you like the prototypical \"Chinee Foo\"...give 'em a shot."}
{"text":"Ate lunch on 12/28.  Good service.  Hot and sour soup was good and Hunan chicken was very good"}
{"text":"I am quite surprised at the positive reviews.  This place struggles to reach mediocre.  Ordered general Tso chicken extra spicy. What arrived has a rather bland plate of deep fried chunks. Shana seemed to like her sweet and sour chicken so maybe I ordered the wrong dish..."}
