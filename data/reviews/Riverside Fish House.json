{"text":"Great food love the fillet flounder meal it's amazing recommend going to eat here.

Great for family or church gathering they are very nice and friendly and they will let you reserve the back room for a big church or family gathering."}
{"text":"Nothing special here folks.  I took my mom here and we both left disappointed.

She ordered green shrimp and they were small and breaded like popcorn shrimp which are not at all desirable and basically a waste of time.  Both of our baked potatoes wouldn't melt butter, and the batter used to fry my oysters and scallops was far too salty and they were nearly inedible.  We informed the waitress and she apologized although it wasn't her fault.  There are much better seafood restaurants around for me to come back here."}

{"text":"Stopped in after Church and was seated as soon as we checked in.... But that's the height of our experience. The waitress was a snoot and not very nice  until it was time for our check The food was slow to come out ( 38 minutes ) and it was so greasy it wasn't fit to eat. Don't think I will ever come back"}
{"text":"We love riverside! You get so much food for your money and it is very worth it. Attached is the 2 for $20 that is more like 6 for $20 because we took some home and ate on it multiple times! Service is always great. We love this place"}
{"text":"I placed an order at 730, I didn't realize they closed at 8. When I got there I apologized and they were very nice. I left a good tip for the inconvenience.  I ordered the green shrimp(which feeds 3 people) because its my favorite menu item. I also ordered the jalapeno poppers which are very good but frozen. Great food every time, friendly staff, a true southern fish camp!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but it was awful! Food was burnt and service was horrible. I will not go back ever. They seem to cater to older adults and only give good service to them. My hamburger steak was so hard I couldn't bite it. The hush puppies were great though."}
{"text":"I love the 20 dollar meal. You get fish, chicken, shrimp, fries, hushpuppies, slaw, tartar sauce, ranch. It's always good. We usually order to go and the 20 dollar box feeds 4 people. You can't beat that. If you want to try it, you will not be disappointed. The wait staff is friendly and food is great. The hushpuppies are so yummy."}
{"text":"Gods food nice place . There service is slow. I order something on the menu and when the check came it was more expensive and we told the manager and she said that she could not change the price even know it said it was one price on the menu . After a while she gave us the right price after some arguing . The house she made it seam like she was doing me a favor for giving me the price on the menu."}
{"text":"Food ok- not large variety- no catfish on bone or scallops- beverage list even smaller. SERVICE is very poor - though started out ok- never saw waitress again til had to flag down for ticket. Need more credit registers- very disorganized and fighting for one charge master."}
{"text":"Excellent fried flounder. Fresh, delicious and spot on. The service was friendly and prompt. Excellent sides. The baked sweet potato was super. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The portions! The place had the tastiest fish I've had in a restaurant! My child had the chicken tenders and they were moist and delicious! Really enjoyed the sweet potato maple cheesecake as well! Definitely will return back for more fried seafood!"}
{"text":"the 2 for $20 is a wonderful deal with enough food for 3-4 people! For those who don't like fish, the chicken tenders are fresh and very good too! Riverside has always had the best coleslaw of any fishcamp I've ever been to."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity from our office to go to this location for lunch on September 30. We were seated immediately and our drink order was taken at that time.

The waitress was very friendly, courteous and attentive. We placed our order and it appeared to be plenty of food as both of the girls at the office were able to take home some of their lunch, as portions were large,  to maybe eat later.

I normally just ate a salad. And I did get the salad bar, and I do have to say the salad bar does not have a large selection however it was adequate for lunch. I did have to ask for dressing as it was not at the salad bar but it was furnished immediately and their tea was excellent. 

We will be putting them on our list of possible places to go for lunch on Thursdays and Fridays as they have extended hours starting at 11:30 AM on those particular days."}
