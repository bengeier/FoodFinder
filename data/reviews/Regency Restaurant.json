{"text":"Great food at a great price. I have tried many different Indian restaurants in the area but I will keep coming back to the Regency Restaurant. My go to is the chicken madras with veggie samosas to start. The madras has a perfect mix of spice and flavor that is perfect. The portion sizes are generous and the prices fair. Only complaint would be the curries are a little bit greasier then I prefer."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews. It's so hard to decide which buffet if the best option when faced with so many options! 

When we walked in, I was hit with the smell of the delicious food. The buffet was well lit and steaming. There were a few tables quietly chatting and eating. Our waiter apologized off the top for being new. He was so nice and attentive. 

The buffet was as even better than I thought that it would be. They had lots of veggie options to try and the butter chicken and Chicken Tikka was so good. In fact, it was a few days ago and I'm still craving it.

We were surprised at how cheap that it was when the bill came. The buffet was $13 each and the wine was $7 a glass. 

**Great place to go with a group of friends. Very relaxing and the food was fresh & yummy**"}
{"text":"A good North Indian style buffet.

The buffet consists of dozens of items. Most of them were main dishes consisting of Rice/Naan + few chicken/goat (no beef) items and a few vegetable items. All of those dishes are common in typical indian restaurants in north america. The only down side; they had only one sweet dish and a few icecreams, but there were a good chatney section. The appetizer and desert sections need a lot of improvement. 

What set this place apart was the taste of the food. All main dishes were nicely spiced in a way that it does not feel too much, but you get plenty of flavours. Food were restocked quickly and was warm enough. 

The interior and cleanliness was also good and the waiters were attentive."}
{"text":"This is now the only Indian food joint I frequent in my neighborhood. Amazing and flavorful selection, and the buffet is available for take out."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my mum last night after a strong recommendation from a colleague. We did the buffet and thought it was okay.

The food was lukewarm at best and not very flavourful. The Saag Paneer was cold as well as a couple of the other dishes. 

My mum ordered the house wine and it sat at the bar for around 10 minutes before anyone brought it over. 

It was a mediocre experience and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Meh food. Not the big flavours you'd expect from great Indian curries. Waiter was rude. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the dinner buffet on May 4, 2013.  I visited Little India with the intention of eating at another restaurant, but after walking the street I selected this restaurant because it seemed \"friendlier\".  About 5-6 tables had people at them when I arrived and I was seated promptly.  The staff was attentive.  

The food was your typical Indian fare and unfortunately spiced-down so it lacked a lot of flavor, but it was certainly acceptable.  The naan that was brought by the waiter could have been fresher, since it did not feel soft and may have simply been reheated.  Not the best naan, but I have had worse.  The gulab jamun was cold instead of warm.  On the bright side, the dessert included all you can eat hard ice cream with a choice of 4-5 flavors.  The butterscotch ice cream was tasty.  

The tandoori chicken pieces were on the small side and lacked meat, but I prefer vegetables anyway, so this was not big thing for me.  

The washrooms are a level below the eating area down some stairs.  The men's washroom was acceptably clean.  

I didn't realize it at first, but while eating I realized that I had eaten at this restaurant about 5-6 years ago during my last trip to Toronto.  I guess that's why I selected it a second time, since it seemed familiar.  

I would eat here again, but I think that I will try a dinner buffet at another restaurant the next time that I visit Little India--if I remember that I had already eaten here twice before!"}
{"text":"Been to couple of places on the little India strip but this one takes the cake. Good flavours, lots of selection, and not greasy. All the meats, including lamb and mutton, were tender and spiced perfectly. Dinner buffet reasonably priced at $15.99. Would recommend it!"}
{"text":"A great place that I go back to fulfill my indian food cravings...always with a full stomach..so beware!
Fresh naan, good selection of curry and salads especially amazing $$ deal for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Visited Toronto last weekend, wandered around Gerrard Street and got a recommendation to go here. Did not enjoy the food. 

We went for the lunch buffet and all shared the same feeling. 

Most items were either bland or too salty, really did not taste like proper Indian cuisine (note: I am a connoisseur). Samosas and pakoras were cold. Rice pudding was watery. Ice cream (which is cool they had an ice cream section) tasted like it had been thawed and re-frozen, had icy bits. 

Items I enjoyed:
Tikka Masala
Butter chicken (very good, if you don't mind it creamy)
Fresh naan
Gulab jamun


Clean interior, nicely decorated, staff was okay. 12 bucks for the buffet, no wait, very spacious.

Would not recommend this place if you are looking for authentic Indian but quick and convenient with a few good dishes if you are desperate."}
{"text":"Nice Indian food spot on Gerrard street. We did their dinner buffet, They have a good selection of food thats tasty and fresh. We only had the vegetarian options so cant comment too much on the meat options that were available."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner one night based on the good reviews. The place itself is nice, there was a decent selection of items on the dinner buffet, but not as extensive as other Indian buffets I've been to. 

The meat dishes were yucky. I felt like I was fishing for chicken in the butter chicken dish. Then when I caught some chicken, I wish I didn't.... it was gross. 

The vegetarian dishes were not bad, that's what saved this meal -- along with the gulab jamun. I wanted to get my $$ worth, so I filled up on the dessert and vegetarian items. 

I would not return here again, I've experienced way better indian buffets in Toronto and the GTA."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We got to try a large variety of quality-made Indian food for a great price at its lunch buffet! My only suggestion is to be more on time with all the food.(we had to wait a bit for all the dishes to be ready)"}
{"text":"Good points:
They are open until late.
Lots of meat and veggie items
Amazing eggplant dish
Only one bad point:
Went there late and the food was on the colder side.
Maybe just bad luck"}
{"text":"Steve: We love Little India and never leave without a bite to eat and a visit to the little corner grocer (whose name I can n-e-v-e-r seem to remember), for a stock up on spices, curries and other goodies for home. We've tried many of the AYCE places along this strip, they've ranged from serviceable to, well, less than stellar. We stopped at Regency for the first time just recently, and we realized what we've been missing this whole time. The buffet has more options than many others, and the food quality was very good, especially considering it was buffet. Lots of veggie options. Butter chicken was outstanding, as was the Korma. And across the board, food was spiced and seasoned well, something that is often dumbed down in these places. A big bonus point for me - lime pickle in the condiments section. Service was good, including prompt drink refills and delivery of fresh naan. When we feel like stuffing our bellies, this will definitely be on the ht list.

Sue: Naan. That is all I have to say. The naan here is the best I have ever eaten and I have eaten some in my time across the globe. Delivered to your table while still hot from the ovens. Perfection. Other food is very good and the atmosphere is good. When going to buffets the assumption can be that you are getting average of everything. Not the case here. Plenty of selection. Staff are friendly and welcoming. Atmosphere is nice and comfortable, it's clean and tidy. Tables are cleared quickly once patrons have left. Overall I highly recommend Regency buffet for those nights when your Indian food craving just won't stop!"}
{"text":"Came here after church on a whim, best decision of the day. I thought that everything tasted very good not too spicy and a lot of flavor. Service was great and everybody was very nice. The price is great and reasonable for a lunch  buffet."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I visited Regency Restaurant for the 1st time. Or at least, what we thought was the first time. Once we sat down, my wife noticed that we actually had been there once before. HINT: This place wasn't worth remembering.

Stepping into the place, we were greeted by no one. Without any indication of the need to be seated, we decided to sit at a table for two near the door. It was only then that an older woman who had previously appeared to be just another guest decided to speak up in order to move us to another table (meant for four) by the buffet, mentioning \"that table is no good\". Thinking that one of the chairs might be booby-trapped to explode, we figured we'd utilize her expertise.

Sitting down at the plastic covered table, we weren't given any further direction. We were unsure as to whether or not the restaurant offered anything other than the buffet because we weren't even given the option. No menu provided, nor a question as to what we were interested in. Perhaps we should have taken it as an insult that they could tell at first look that we were there for the all you can eat? I'M NOT FAT...I'M JUST BIG BONED!

I'll be the first to admit my fondness for alcohol. So it was a tad disappointing that there wasn't even an attempt from any of the staff to take a drink order from us despite the bar located in the corner of the restaurant. From what we could spot, there was only a single drink menu even out on display on an empty table. Suffice to say we didn't bother trying to order, if there's so little focus on the drinks to begin with we couldn't imagine there would be anything worth getting.

The most important part of any restaurant is the food, right? Unfortunately it's here that Regency fails the most. While there's a decently sized selection on hand (about 6 meat selections, 6 veggie and a salad station), not much of it was worth trying. Of the famous Indian standards such as butter chicken and saag paneer, they were oddly too sweet or flavourless respectively. All off the other dishes either didn't carry enough flavour, felt too gritty or simply relied on too heavy a spice to make up for everything it was lacking. Pakoras were cold and gritty. The naan at least was nice enough to serve its purpose, although, you kind of have to try to screw up bread.

The one bright side of things was dessert. The gulab jumun was actually the best either of us have ever had at an Indian restaurant. While on the too sweet side, it was nicely spiced and was a great tool to get some of the curry oil out of our mouths. Alongside it was the standard tubs of generic ice cream should that be more to your liking.

The bathrooms were in the basement, of which had badly stained carpeted that smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in the past five winters. And what appeared to be a crushed baby cockroach against a wall.

All in all, the meal was only $13.99 a person for all you can eat. But there was very little to actually enjoy even at that price. The hallmark to all you can eat is the feeling of being overstuffed on your way out the door. And at Regency there simply wasn't enough food there worthwhile stuffing your face with."}
{"text":"If you happen to be in the Little India neihbourhood, go to The Regency Restaurant! Their lunch buffet was just $9.99. The interior was really clean and they had Goat Curry (I literally ate 12 pieces), Tandoori Chicken (fresh and hot and flavourful), Chicken Tikka Masala (standard flavours), Butter Chicken (NO BONES!! And really creamy) and Chicken Curry (just like homemade chicken curry my mom makes). They also had some pretty good vegetarian dishes. They also had a cute little salad section with raitha. The servers brought us oven-fresh naan to our table. It was steaming hot and it literally came out of the oven. Water was filled up pretty quick. Their dessert section was tasty with 3-4 different kinds of ice creams and Gulab Jamun was sooooo good. ALL THAT FOR JUST 10 BUCKS! Oh, while you're at it, try their Mango Shake. It was made with real mangoes (from India) and milk! I had two of those! The servers were very nice. And their dinner buffet is just $12.99! Best buffet restaurant in the whole Toronto area. Take my word for it!"}
{"text":"I come here quite q bit for their buffet. The food is always fresh and delicious and excellent value for Toronto standards.
My favourites are the Lamb Vindaloo and the Saag Paneer. The rice is lovely and he naan is always freshly made to order. 
Looking forward to the next time."}
{"text":"Sunday buffet dinner $15.99. Listened to the advice of fellow yelpers and ordered naan when we sat down. They have good hours and it's nice to have a buffet in the area. 

Service was fair: they don't always pick up your used dishes or refill your water when it's empty but they're responsive when you ask. 

Food was tasty but things like the parkora and samosas were only sortof warm on the inside. They had a good veggie option but I was hoping for at least 1 seafood option."}
{"text":"With the closing of Banjara, I've been having some major withdrawals and Indian food cravings. On Sunday, I decided to venture out to this place in search of some Indian comfort food. Bad idea - still living with regret from this decision. I don't know why the ratings here are so high; there honestly was not a single dish in their buffet selection that was done right. The channa masala, punjabi kadhi, daal, and eggplant curry were all so watery and lacked salt&flavor. I tried some of the non-veg curries - equally watery and flavorless. Even the butter chicken (the staple dish of Indian restaurants) tasted so off here. That was $13 spent that went straight down the drain and just made me crave my mom's home-cooked food even more. 

Safe to say I will not be returning - so many other great options near Yonge/Eglinton or other areas in the GTA."}
{"text":"We came for dinner buffet. Everything was delicious. Our waiter was very pleasant. 
My favourite was the lamb vindaloo. The dish is not present in any other Indian buffets. 
Negative: is the food is a bit too greasy and the fruit tray was empty for an hour. The washroom was horrific."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've come to Regency and boy was I thrilled by the surprise of how wonderful this place has become. I used to have dinner here frequently with friends back in the day (circa 2001-2007).

I'm stunned at how incredible the improvements are, not just to the atmosphere but (most importantly) the food. The buffet here is exceptionally good -- the ingredients are fresh, the variety of dishes plentiful, the flavor excellent, and the presentation very appealing.

I live in LA now, which I must admit is wonderful, but I'm a little bummed that I don't have regular access to this wonderful spot anymore. Probably better for my waistline but I will very look forward to visits home because of visits here.

What a delightful, unexpected surprise!"}
{"text":"Needing a quick fix of yummy Indian fare, we decided to try a place new to us. Regency looked okay, buffet looked decent, why not? Well if you're after real Indian food with true flavours, not ersatz, this is not your best choice. The food was only so-so, not spicy or spicy hot. Their Vindaloo (the best test for heat) was not hot and although chicken tikka and Butter chicken were tender, they did not have what it takes for a genuine taste of India. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I'll admit that it has been a while since I've been to Regency but I'm very happy that to see that it has quite a good review!

Years ago this place was one of my go-to locations for Indian buffet. The food was of good quality, the Naan was always fresh and tasty and the selection was solid. Also, importantly, the place was always clean. It looks like I should come visit again soon. :)"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is decently priced, there's a good selection although it's kind of \"white people\" indian food. 
Aside from being slightly racist and judgmental perhaps, this description perfectly explains the food found there. 
It's a bit flavourless to cater to more people, understandably, but less spice does not have to mean no flavour. 

That being said I like it because it's not as chaotic and packed as some of the other restaurants, it's relatively well priced and when you are not sure what you want, you just know you want some indian food, it's great because you get it all. 

Bonus: there's also ice cream for desert!"}
{"text":"Best affordable Indian buffet restaurant. Our family goes there every weekend when we live in downtown. We miss here naan so much after we've moved uptown."}
{"text":"I always go for the lunch buffet and it's amazing!  This is very similiar to most of the other Indian buffets nearby the area.  The reason I prefer Regency is the size of the restaurant, they are a lot bigger in size compared to the ones nearby.  

The food is always served fresh!  I love their salads, curry chicken, lamb is so tender, beef always tender as well and flavourful, the chickpeas, naan, chicken tikka masala, daal, everything is my favourite here.  I do admit it is a bit Canadianized in terms of the spice because they don't use as heavy in spices but I can't complain!  The price is very affordable I believe it was $10 for lunch buffet or cheaper?!

Really enjoy this place and would love to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Regency is the best! My family and I come here at least once a week. Great food and always amazing service from our server Iran. For Valentine's Day he even surprised us with a red pepper shaped in the heart on top of our Shrimp Biryani"}
{"text":"For Indian food in Little India that was recommended by relatives who've lived all their lives in Toronto and is married to someone who is part Indian, I thought, \"If they say this place is good, it must be pretty good.\"

Boy, was I wrong. They've been spot on in all of their Toronto recommendations in the neighborhood but this one seemed a bit off. Now, I've been to India twice and have had some of the best Indian cuisine while I was there and have been hard to impress when it comes to Indian food since. I've found two places that I really like where I live in Southern California that I would say is just as good as the food I had in India.

Maybe it was the buffet that I decided to get but the food in the buffet line was greasy and at best, bland. None of the signature flavors for each dish jumped out and the food tasted a little old. The chicken was dry and flavorless and the lamb was swimming in oil.

The best thing I had was the imported beer which I always enjoy at an Indian restaurant. Service was ok if not a little slow to respond.

I've yet to be impressed with the Indian food in Toronto which is surprising judging from the Indian population that live in this area. I'll just get my Indian food fix when I go back to Orange County.

Parking: Street and limited
Price: $20 per person
Wait: None"}
{"text":"We tried to get food across the street, but were ignored, so we decided to try this place out, I had heard of it, and for $12.99 for all you can eat, it warranted a try. 
The one and only guy running the place was very friendly, the place was empty except for a table full of police (pretty good sign a restaurant is decent) but we were early, once the dinner rush hit, there were no tables to be had.
The buffet was very good, Everything was labeled (a big deal since I don't know much about Indian food).
As stated in another review, butter chicken was a bit hard to find, but the chicken was very good once it was found.
I liked the tandoori chicken, the rice biryani, the samosas, aloo gobi (I think, it was the curried potatoes and cauliflower) and the sweet honey balls for dessert were great (a few of the ice cream flavors were empty next to the honey balls, but it was a buffet run by one guy)
Water was refilled often, and empty plates were taken away quickly, I liked this place. 
Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a solid inexpensive Indian buffet in Little India that has all of the basics you'd expect for South Asian fare. Butter chicken, palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, naan, raita... it's all here. Objectively, you can have better food at an a-la-carte restaurant but for just under $17 at dinner on a weekday, I really can't complain. 

The service is also great. My water has been refilled so frequently that sometimes I couldn't even make it past two sips. 

All in all, a decent, inexpensive Indian buffet with good service. Make sure to bring pants with stretchy waistbands."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian and meat dishes.  The tandoori chicken is good.  I've been to a lot of great restaurants in Delhi and Rajasthan and this place is on par."}
{"text":"It's no Banjara but it's my new second favorite buffet. I went to a place with better ratings down the street but their buffet selection sucked for pretty much the same price so I left quickly and found this one. For $13 I was really satisfied with the selection. Tons of veg dishes, a fair bit of meat (if you're into that sort of thing).

The dahl, channa, and matter paneer were all very good. The koftas were awesome. They had mixed vegetables thrown in and a little kick of heat with a nice creamy gravy. The kadhi pakora also have gravy that was just made for naan-sopping. Speaking of pakoras and koftas, see what I mean about selection? How many places have those choices on the buffet? The saag was good but it was much chunkier than what I really crave. I wished I had my magic bullet with me to break it down a little more. The naan came out hot and fresh served to the table. Dessert was ok, but could have used a little more selection. The ice cream was just ice cream, not kulfi. The gulab jamun were nice, though. I also got a mango lassi which came out in two minutes or less which impressed me because I'm accustomed to waiting 15 minutes in Toronto for one of those (I've often wondered exactly how like it takes to stir together some yogurt and mango slime). My vegetarianism was flaring up so I didn't sample the meat. Service was friendly and efficient, two of the servers were gorgeous dudes which was nice but really doesn't have any bearing on the review, and the place was clean. I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been to regency a few times and each time it is the same. The food is authentic and  just oh so good.  The ambiance is warm and homely and always clean. The staff is very professional,  helpful and friendly. Its the kind of service that makes you happy to tip.  It is very easy for me to rate them five stars."}
{"text":"Love the paneer here and the masala tea.. Overall, the entire buffet is great and fresh. Family owned and very friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always have to roll me out of the restaurant when I'm finished. The staff is nice and welcoming. Food is always delish"}
{"text":"We came here because of the excellent Yelp reviews, and let's just say the Yelp community did not disappoint! Their buffet was exceptional with tons of choices, and everything was very fresh. To top it off, the service was outstanding. For the price (I believe we paid $15.99 for dinner buffet) I doubt you will find a better Indian restaurant within miles, and trust me, there are many in Toronto. It was also situated in a cute little neighbourhood that reminded me of a \"Little India.\" I can't say the food is 100% authentic considering I've never been to India, but for someone with an eclectic palette, this was top of the line!"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with this place, yummy Indian buffet the ones who like quality buffets !!!! Service is polite and efficient. When I ask for the finished items they were able to provide more immediately. We regularly go to this place. It is around 14-15 dollars plus tax on weekend dinners, lunch and weekdays are cheaper. Great value for this price !!! not a huge buffet but it is good enough and all the dishes keep their original taste, all yummy !! when our friends and family come out of town we always take them here and they all love it, highly recommended !!! My favorites here are butter chicken and curry mutton, I make sure that I take some yogurt cucumber as side dish to cool down when the food becomes more spicy, they bring fresh warm naan to the table, it has 2 sweets but good enough and variety of ice creams, good to have a bit if you still have space after eating this great meal !!"}
{"text":"Average food.
Service was good the guy serving food was very humble but the owner was rude..
She didnt even bother to say a hii or ask abt the reviews of the food.

And now about the food....they have greart variety but awful taste.wont recommend.."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Came in for lunch buffet, which was an excellent deal at $9.99 and A LOT of food to choose from: about 12 mains, breads, salad, even a few flavors of ice cream. The waiter was very attentive and super fast with water refills. 

I didn't love all the food though. Chana masala and saag paneer, normally my favorites, lacked flavor, and saag paneer in particular was just overflowing with grease. I did, however, enjoy all the other dishes I tried a lot, so I'd certainly come here again for buffet."}
{"text":"Our go to for Indian take out in leslieville. It's cheap and good and for take out very quick - a family of 2 adults and 2 almost teen kids can eat for $25. 

They offer a buffet for eat in which is good, but around $12 or so a person."}
{"text":"I like the service here. Probably not the best Indian food, but not the worst either.
My favourite buffet."}
{"text":"Poor ambience, Gulab Jamun wasn't warmed up, Ice cream was placed in a freezer in the original containers that they purchased it in. This restaurant seems to have tried to minimize overhead costs. Waiter looked bored out of his mind. 15$ wasted on this buffet."}
{"text":"This is probably the best buffet indian Restaurant in Little India on Gerrard st.  I know there are a couple of bigger ones that seem very popular with the locals, but the tables there suck, and the floors are like in a bathroom - bad ambience.  Regency has a very tasteful furniture and ambience inside.  

The food is excellent and there are lots of choices, both meat and vegetarian.  Fresh naan is brought to your table.  There's an entire serving area just for different salads and chutneys.  The deserts are great too (gulab jamon!) and there's ice cream which everyone seems to love, but why in hell would you eat western ice cream in an Indian restaurant when there are so many better choices of authentic Indian deserts???

Washrooms are in the basement and could use a reno and some more cleanliness."}
{"text":"Dinner Buffet was great! Friendly service, fresh and tasty food with a wide variety of selections.

Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality and variety. Buffet always fresh and topped up. Plenty of choices for both vegetarian and omnivore, alike. Naan prepared in authentic tandoor oven  once you get seated.

So many options in Toronto find decent Indian food. I keep returning to Regency b/c it's consistent and always a notch above, IMHO."}
{"text":"Okay, the carpet is so dirty it looks like it will roll itself up and die.  But the kitchen appears clean and for $12.99 at dinner they have an excellent buffet.  Not the largest Indian buffet I've ever seen, but for $12.99 what would you expect.  The dishes seem to have some regulars, especially the meat dishes, which include very tender tandoori chicken, good curried goat and chicken tikka masala, plus butter chicken and other delights.  The veggie dishes always seem to include daal, aloo gobhi and chana masala, all excellent.  Eggplant and okra are both great when they offer them.  Desserts are limited to kheer, gulab jamun and western ice cream (not kulfi).  Full bar.  Pleasant and considerate service.

Not for impressing a guest with decor and atmosphere but good for a quick Indian buffet fix, especially when you want a buffet open at dinner time."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time 2 weeks ago after a friend recommended them to me. The buffet table is huge and each dish was HEAT hot ! Had two large plates of their delicious food, easily, the best Indian restaurant I've ever eaten at in Toronto and after I left, I quickly got online to inform others of this establishment. Going again real soon!! Dishes such as the Tandoori Chicken, Channa Masala, crispy Naan Bread and baked Veggie Samosas are as good/great as it gets in Toronto. Service was friendly, glasses constantly filled, and the food kept coming out of the kitchen, quickly. Can't believe Regency slipped under my radar as it's not far from where I live. Worthy of REPEAT visits !"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet for 11.99$! Had a very nice server as well! Loved the Naan made fresh to order and the chicken biryani will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Walking down the street, my sister and I were drawn by the smell from the restaurant. This is a solid buffet for both the omnivore and the vegetarian. When you walk in, you see friendly staff and a very clean and spacious interior. 

There are probably a dozen hot dishes. The samosas are huge! Of the 6 vegetarian dishes available, I highly recommend the bharta and saag paneer, which is creamier than I've usually had. The dahl makhni is good too. All the dishes were fresh and tasty. I also like that there's easy access to the mint/coriander, tamarind and yogurt sauces.  

Drinks are cheap too and a mango juice is only $2!  

Great for large family gatherings or small groups."}
{"text":"Baingan bharta (or as they called it here - Bengan Bhartha)  - a super-melted eggplant/onion dish.  So delicious.

I've been eating in Little India since 1982.  This was my first trip to the Regency and I am sad I'd never been here before.   Really good buffet.  The mutton and matar paneer were excellent.   All of the veggie dishes were good.  The tandoor chicken was about the best I've had in the neighbourhood - flavourful and not oily at all.  I'm still trying to identify the very good fish kari that was served.   Fresh naan brought to the table regularly.   Staff kept an eye on the tables and the buffet.  Nice condiment/salady section.  

the baingan bharta .... the best ... in the neighbourhood and maybe anywhere I've had it.

We'll be going back.  Terrific place."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp. Decided to try it and was not disappointed. Everything was so delicious and fresh. When we first went in it was pretty quiet but it got busier as we finished up. I was very surprised with our bill! $35 for two people, all you can eat and we each got a pop as well. Such a great deal and I will definitely revisit."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious ! I decided to stop in for the dinner buffet and everything was fresh and full of flavour. Mild on the spice front (for those who want that Indian flavour without the full flame) i highly recommend asking them for a hot cup of Masala Chai to end your feast with a Gulab Jamun (which is also part of the buffet) along with thre rice pudding. The service was great! The servers are kind and helpful! Can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"The butter chicken is so insanely good that I would eat it even if it was just sauce and no chicken. Or I would have the tender and juicy chicken without sauce."}

Lots of selection 
Very clean
Very pleased
Awesome dishes and amazing rice pudding"}
{"text":"I really love this Indian buffet. The food is delicious, and they have great selection (even for vegetarians). The service is good as well. Also, the had some sort of amazing mint ice cream for dessert...not that you go out for Indian looking for mint ice cream, but I'd go back just for that!"}

I love this place

I went back in Oct 2011"}
{"text":"Decent Indian food, but that's usually the case when it's buffet style. Definitely not the best Indian food I've had, but it's a great meal for the price. 

The service was a lacking. My family and I were the only ones in the restaurant, but the server was incredibly unfriendly. He told us that the restaurant was closing in a few minutes, even though they were supposed to close in an hour and a half. Perhaps we looked like we were obviously from out of town or not apart of the community, but he did not want to serve us. He continued to remind us throughout our meal that they were closing in 20 minutes as if to rush our meal. 

I've been to better restaurants with better service. I'll definitely pass on this place and would not recommend it to anyone else."}
