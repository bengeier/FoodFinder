{"text":"A very clean place. From the seating area (non-sticky tables) to the open kitchen! The owners are superb people. 1st Timer... And just by the service, smell of the food (no grease in the air), and the up beat pace in the kitche... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The staff was very courteous and engaged, and the wings were excellent.  Nice and crispy and excellent flavor (I had the extra hot).  Small new hidden gem.  Family owned so always great to support local!  They make all their sauces, dressings.  Their food is all freshly prepared (except mozzarella stixs).  Burgers, chicken sandwiches, shrimp, bone in and boneless wings, and fresh cut fries.  Good lunch special.  Must try!"}
{"text":"I recently stumbled upon this establishment while going to get pizza from the restaurant next door. I consider myself a wing head, but I have had a difficult time finding a good wing spot in the city. I was pleasantly surprised buy the excellent service and attention that I received at wing eaters. The wings are excellent!! You can tell the they put care into the food and will go out of their way to please their customers. Will be back for sure! A+"}
{"text":"I discovered wing eaters a couple of months ago and have been a weekly customer since. Their wings are amazing and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. However, for the 3rd time since finding wing eaters, I tried calling and showing up during normal posted business hours and they were closed. I showed up today (a Wednesday) at 11:45 hoping to get lunch for my wife and I, and they were closed. After the 2nd time this happened to us, I left a review on their Facebook page saying you have to do a better job of communicating hours with your customers, but clearly that fell on deaf ears. So now after the 3rd time of this happening, I won't be back. As a small local business, you have to do a better job of meeting basic customer expectations."}
{"text":"Really great flavor on the wings! I wish the were a bit bigger in size. Their \"Hot\" flavor is actually a medium so if you like it spicy go with something with at least 1 hot pepper icon on their menu. The Mango Habanero sauce is on point! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Okay--I'm from Chi-Town where the fried wing places are plentiful and GOOD WINGS!
Having said that I yelped wing eaters and ordered 10 wings with Thai sauce and small fries.
The small cup of fries were $2.50 , the 10 wings $11.50, and a bottle of Coke $1.89(no fountain drinks available!)
 Now, the wings were flavorful but these were the smallest wings I've ever seen in my life!! Pics attached. Home made fries very good but small cup $2.50???
My only complaint would be the prices!!
I hate to pay $18.35 for 10 peewee wings, small fry, and a bottle of Coke and leave HUNGRY!!
Will not return sorry"}
{"text":"We checked this place out last weekend and my husband and I agreed that they were the best wings either of us have had, especially in the greater Charlotte area. We told the owners so! Perfectly crispy, sauces were great, and everyone we interacted with was friendly and attentive. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New wing place near the house. I bought wings and fries. The wings although a little small were very good. The fries were really good also. I will definitely be back to take care of my wing cravings."}
{"text":"We ate here a few weeks ago and definitely enjoyed our dinner. The wings were wonderful and fresh. The owners are extremely hospitable and personable, we appreciated them a lot and all of their help understanding the menu. They even brought out their fresh homemade fries for free for us to try with our wings. Our only complaint was the prices were pretty high and doesn't include a side or anything. It was also different that they didn't have a drink machine only bottled drinks, that would definitely be a recommendation to implement. Otherwise, a nice local wing place!"}
