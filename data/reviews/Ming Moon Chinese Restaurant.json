{"text":"Do yourself a favor. Buy a can of LaChoy Chinese...separate the two cans... open 'em pour 'em in a pan and heat 'em up. That's what they do and you can save 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Always put my order in online and it's always fresh and hot when I arrive to pick it up.  I can't complain about this place and they are friendly when you go inside.  I have ordered many time from here now and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Having just moved into the area and looking to familiarize myself with the local take out offerings I stumbled across this restaurant. The food was good and was out quick. The Hunan chicken and shrimp was loaded with both proteins and vegetables. The back of house was in a heated arguement that could be heard up front would be my only criticism. Will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving Chinese food one night and this so happened to be on our route home, so we decided to stop in. The inside was a nice little quaint dining area. A little boy took our order, which was funny in itself, and he was cute and courteous. There was also a bed behind the counter...all of that aside, we got our food and went home.   Everything was packaged very nicely. All of the food was more than we could have hoped for, very large portions. We both loved our meals. This is definitely a quality place if you want some good, quick Chinese meals. This will be our go to spot from now on!"}
{"text":"We use to order from here 2-3 times a week, unfortunately we had to stop. The decline is actually kind of depressing. Why is Chinese food so bad in Cleveland? The quality of the food was poor in addition to not including important items (duck sauce, gravy, pancakes ect)"}
{"text":"I order delivery from here all the time and the food is good and usually very fast getting it!! General Tso, egg rolls, boneless spareribs and egg drop/ wonton soups are tasty!! Definitely recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not happy.  Placed a to-go order so we could grab it and head home, as you do. Called, places said order, lady said \"15 minutes\". Perfect. We were 15-20 minutes away and my pregnant butt is starving and salivating at the thought of some orange chicken....  We get to pick up our order, and she tells us it isn't ready and that they wait to make the orders until after you pay. I get it, it makes sense, but it's never been like that before or any of the other take out places, so why now? And why not tell me this when I was on the phone with you? Very rude.   Now I'm starving, sitting in their parking lot, and really wishing I wanted something other than Chinese food.  Moral of the story: if you're hungry and want take out, order in the restaurant because apparently they can't take phone orders and prepare them like normal restaurants do.  **edited after we ate. General concensus was it sucked. The rice was still crunchy, orange chicken had a bad flavor, and egg fu yung was gummy. Not going back."}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered has always been good and hot. Always quick to  recommend  new items and always hot. Great for takeout!"}
{"text":"General tso's was amazing! Kung Pao was good but needed some soy sauce, overall pretty tasty! Would go back!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! What ever you do don't order from here!!!! So nasty ! They mess your order up and refuse to fix it! They matter fact want to charge you extra why!!!!! When they messed up on the order! It's nasty, bland no flavor what's so ever, the rice is dryyyy and the chicken is under cooked! Omg never in my life have I dealt with such rude people ! Again SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME, don't bother with this place it's disgusting!"}
{"text":"The Bean Curd Hunan Style - #46 - is the best around!  Very difficult finding good tofu around here. While seating is available, this is really a take-out restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever! When we called to place the order we stated it was for delivery. We ordered the food and the lady hung up on us. We had to call back to give them the address and pay and she was extremely rude. They called us back 3 minutes later because they didn't process the card correctly. It took 45 minutes for the order to be delivered which isn't a big deal however the delivery guy brought his child with him. It was weird to say the least. Our food was very bland and quite honestly a waste of money. I've never had Chinese food that didn't taste like anything. Eating a card board box would have been more appetizing. Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese take out. 5 star for consistent in taste and fast service!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online. Online ordering was easy and convenient. Lots of choices. Delivery wait was only 15 minutes. All the food was good. Will order again the next time we want Chinese food."}
{"text":"Ming Moon is quick and adequate. The food isn't bad, but it's not going to make you say \"wow\", either. The portions are above average, and they're open late, but it's not the place to go to if you really want to enjoy some Chinese food."}
{"text":"WILL NOT EVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN. Placed delivery order at 7pm, called the restaurant at 8:40pm to ask about our delivery and the women put us on hold but all we could hear was yelling... we began yelling into the phone to get their attention after 5 min on hold. We hung up and called back again and when the lady answered we explained to her that we had ordered our food over 1 hour and 45 min ago and she immediately yelled \"it's on it's way\". We finally received our food 2 hours later. Very disappointed with the customer service and unfortunately will not be ordering from there ever again."}
