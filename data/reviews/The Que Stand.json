{"text":"I love this place!   Everything I've ever had was fantastic.  I once got the barbeque plate, and it was enough for two meals.  I've had the turkey sandwich and it was huge.  I love the cheeseburgers and fries.  There is such attention to detail, like the bun being perfectly toasted, and the fries are amazing.  The onion rings are too.  Since it's basically across the street, I like to stop in after work.   The guy who works there is very friendly.  He always make sure to ask you what condiments you need.  I recommend them to everyone."}
{"text":"stopped by the que to check it out. SO disappointed. Not real BBQ. the meat was obviously a left over from the day//days before and cooked/steamed in the oven. the Cole slaw was without a doubt ready to be thrown out and NOT FRESH. the Q lacked that smoky taste from real Q. Nice guy and friendly took my order. Taste and quality-poor. won't go back. It's a shame because I like to support home grown owners and not the franchise's."}
{"text":"I live right near the Harrisburg/Charlotte line. The food is amazing! I've been back three times in the last two weeks and am craving it again!

Pulled pork sliders - REALLY good! They dont have that unappetizing greasyness BBQ sometimes get. The sweet sauce is the perfect accompaniement.

Smoked Chicken Wings - WOW. I like wings but had no idea they could be so good. They don't need sauce, or ranch, or anything. Yum yum.

Smoked turkey and swiss slider - MY FAVORITE so far. Get it how it comes. It is soooooo good. The turkey has amazing flavor, it's juicy, and pairs deliciously with the creamy swiss on the sammich.
Talking about this makes me hungry! The Que Stand, anyone?"}
{"text":"This makes the second place I've found in Charlotte that has food that's as good as any place I'd ever frequent in Houston..and it's BBQ!? The digs leave much to be desired, sure. It's inside of a gas station/travel plaza. However, we'll be going back very soon. It was delicious! We talked about our pulled pork sandwiches all the way home. I cannot speak more emphatically as to the tastiness of the food."}
{"text":"Great BBQ great service. If you in the area you got to try this place good eats!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd review of The Q Stand.
 I had to write it because Yelp has filtered out my 5 star review and 11 other 5 star reviews.
 My review was a real one and I know one other of the filtered out reviewers and hers was a real review as well, 
This place has great food. 
Read the filtered out reviews! There is a link at the bottom of page to look at them. This place would have almost 5 stars total if they had not taken away 12 out of 15.

{"text":"The Que Stand is the home to some of the best BBQ and Chicken Wings I have ever had.  It is located inside a gas station and is difficult to find.  If you're looking for a restaurant to eat this is not it.  There are tables inside to sit and eat, but it's a gas station/truck stop and you should expect people coming in and out like normal gas station business.  That being said, it is NOT gas station food.  I've eaten at all kinds of BBQ places in and around Charlotte and most of them don't hold a candle to the Que Stand in terms of quality and bang for the buck.  

The BBQ is very good.  They offer several different sauces for you to meet everyone's taste - sweet sauce, vinegar sauce, mustard sauce.  The BBQ is consistently good and I've always been pleased.  

They also offer smoked chicken wings.  I consider myself a bit of a chicken wing connoisseur in that I eat them about once a week and the Que Stand delivers.  They sell whole smoked wings and they are large.  They offer different sauce options, but the best ones are the regular dry rubbed.  The seasoning is exceptional and the wings are perfectly cooked.

They offer a variety of sides and honestly their french fries are some of the best I've ever had.  The seasoning on them is great and I get them every time.

As far as affordability you can't beat it.  They offer a family four pack for $20 and it includes 2 meats, 2 sides, sauce, and bread (either buns or rolls).  It's plenty of food for four people and you can add more food to it for $5/person.

I bought food there for my fantasy football draft in August and all of the guys loved it and raved about how good it was.  They were all shocked that the food came from a gas station - and any preconceived notions they had were quickly put aside.  I highly recommend the Que Stand to all BBQ fans!"}
{"text":"I was in Concord with my son who was playing soccer.  After his game, we decided to get some food.  I had been looking for a unique place to eat and this certainly seemed to fit the bill.  I discussed the Que Stand with him and told him that it got good reviews and it was in a gas station.  He initially balked.  I asked him \"If a supermodel in a bikini was in a gas station would you not like to see her?\"  With this logic we set out for the Que Stand.  Maybe not the same as a supermodel but very respectable.  They were out of brisket so I tried the pulled pork with mac and cheese and the fries.  My son had the BBQ chicken breasts.  The food was outstanding.  If they were not 3 hours from home, I would come back often."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQue for the $ but in a gas station with some NASTY bathrooms.

The bar-b-que was moist and tasty although a little too much vinegar for my palate.  But, once you put on some sweet sauce, all that blended together.  Nice sized sandwich for $3.  Check-in via yelp and they'll give you a little slider for free.

Breakfast options available as well.

Here's where it gets nasty though.  I'm assuming those employees had to use the same restroom as me.  And the thought of someone cooking my food after being in there made me kinda sick to my stomach.  Not sure how health codes work in food biz's inside of gas stations but, seriously doubt they'd get an A rating if you took the whole place into consideration.  And the fact that you pay at the register means there is some kind of coordination going on."}
{"text":"I have eaten there 3 times this past month...always picking up something on the way home from work. I do a foodie blog on Facebook and review a lot of restaurants, more than 100, and many very upscale. So I do know what I'm talking about with I tell you this is Great Food...and to those who have a problem w/ it being in a gas station...get over it...Good food is good food. Here are the past 3 Facebook reviews I've posted about 3 different dishes I've had there...along w/ pictures.

Trying out a new BBQ place in Harrisburg...supposed to be real pit smoked...got Brisket w/ sweet sauce & pulled pork w/ vinegar, Amazing wings...this place seems like it just might be the real deal...And yes, it's in the Citgo in Harrisurg...but so what...it Rocks... -- at The Que Stand

The Que Stand in Harrisburg...Their Two Meat Combo...Extremely Tender Beef Brisket w/ Western Carolina Sweet BBQ Sauce...Hand Pulled Pork w/ Eastern Carolina Vinegar Sauce, Both Pit Smoked Fresh Each Day...(South Carolina Mustard BBQ Sauce is Available Too)...Along w/ 2 Sides...I chose Fried Okra & Aunt Sissy's Potato Salad...For $11.50 was more than enough for dinner tonight AND lunch tomorrow...2 people could easily eat off this one plate...

The Que Stand Smoked Wings...The Draw was Just Too Much...I had to go Back the Next Day for the Wings...The Smoked Wings at the Que Stand Just had Too Much Draw...Huge Whole Wings, Hand Seasoned and Slow Smoked over Hickory Until Super Tender...Then Fried to Order and Seasoned w/ Memphis Dry Rub Seasoning (My Choice) or several other Buffalo Style Sauces. I go to a lot of Restaurants, and Eat a Lot of Wings...I Even Cook Some that I Would Put Up Against Most...My Slow Roasted Wings are in a Wet Garlic Hot Sauce...a Totally Different Animal to these Dry Ribs...All I can say is that these Wings ROCK...Perfect Skin Crunch...Perfect Salty Spice...Amazingly Moist and Juicy...No Sauce at all required...They are not Blow Your Head Off Hot...but I'm sure they have those sauces...but just please try this Memphis Dry Rub Seasoning first...it is so good...So again...I'm faced w/ the fact that this place is way too close to my house...These are some great wings...

And finally tonight's Facebook Review...
The Que Stand's Two Hand Beef Brisket Sandwich...BBQ Fans, You Must Try This Brisket. It By Far is the BEST Beef Brisket I've Ever Had...1/3 Lb. of Thinly Sliced, Amazingly Tender BBQ Brisket on a Toasted Bun w/ Eastern NC Vinegar BBQ Sauce and Topped w/ an Onion Ring...I Opted to Replace the Standard Cheese w/ Cole Slaw...and a Side of Potato Salad...This sandwich lives up to it's name, it does take 2 hands to eat it, and honestly, I couldn't finish it...There's still maybe 1/2 of it in my fridge for lunch tomorrow...Again, Props to The Que Stand..."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm a little bit disappointed in my fellow YELPERS.  I've read all four reviews on the Que Stand, and not one single review has mentioned that it is located INSIDE of a GAS STATION!  Now, you can draw your own conclusions about food service inside of a gas station.  I'm stating that fact first, before I mention anything else about the food because the place is nearly IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND if you don't know its located INSIDE of the GAS STATION!!! I looked for this place on THREE separate occasions.  I even had to ask a multiple of locals in the Harrisburg area, before I was finally able to find someone that had heard of this place and knew where it was.  

Upon finally locating this establishment on a recent Saturday evening, I was more than a little disappointed when informed that they were out of BBQ for the night.  

I FINALLY got here on a Sunday afternoon, around noon and was able to place an order for a BBQ sandwich w/slaw and fries as my side item.  

Despite the fact that this place is impossible to find unless you know exactly where it is, and despite the fact that its located in a gas station (which can be a turn-off for some), the food was actually pretty decent.  When my food arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at how big the sandwich was (see pics).  The slaw appeared fresh, however I wish they would've put a bigger helping on my sandwich (see pics).  The kaiser roll was soft, yet solid enough to stay intact despite the slaw, and wet bbq sauce that smothered the 'QUE.  The actual taste of the 'QUE was more than solid.  Not the best I've ever had, but good enough so that I would def go back and try it again for the $6.00 I paid.  The fries that came as my side were piping hot and crisp; def better than your average french fries.  

The service was excellent.  The gentleman that took my order, was friendly, and apologized for running out of 'que the previous night.  My ordered arrived fairly promptly and to my specifications.    

All in all, I gave The Que Stand three stars because even though the food was better than average, it wasn't exactly \"knock your socks off\" good.  I also HAVE TO DOWNGRADE THIS PLACE for not being easy to find.  There is no mention on the yelp page or on the website that this establishment is INSIDE of a gas station.  With that being said, now that I know where its located, I would def give the Que Stand another try."}
{"text":"Great Mac Salad!!! The Brisket Is Awesome My Wife Loves The Brisket Sandwich  A Must Have When I Come Home!!!"}
{"text":"Does anyone know where these guys went?  They had the BEST mac & cheese and wonderful BBQ on the go.  I miss them!!!!"}
{"text":"Someone had told me about seeing posts of the Que Stand and frankly never even crossed my mind to go there.  While I didn't start out going there for lunch today, I'll make sure I include it as a regular lunch option!  Sure it's in a gas station, but surprisingly good; besides you never know when you need a snickers after lunch.

I had the Brisket sandwich, onion rings, and baked beans.  It's hard for me to believe that a brisket sandwich that good could come from a place outside Texas. I believe if a place gives you a reason to go back...keep going.  I even made a date to take my wife next time! 

Food 4 out of 5
Service 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Ahh... yeah, I was kind of underwhelmed. The staff was nice and friendly, but not my favorite BBQ. I prefer mine really lean and really slow smoked. all of ours was fatty and gooy. I can name a few other places (all a bit of a drive) that are way better BBQ."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. It's one of the best stops for the group when we are on our lunch breaks. You can call ahead place an order and go pick it up. 

Lets clear things up YES it's located inside a gas station but NO that shouldn't affect what people think about it. Just because a place is big and fancy doesn't mean the food is amazing, but also just because the place is a small hole in the wall it doesn't mean the place is going to be nasty. 

Even though it's a BBQ place they have some amazing burgers! I usually stick to the bacon double deluxe. Bacon meat and cheese always a good thing. The burgers have always came out fresh and juicy. Only once have a ever had a semi dry burger from here. They cook fresh fries for every order. And you can't really beat the price it's pretty cheap. 

If you check in on here or FourSquare you get a free slider so if you like free food like I do you might wanna take advantage of it. 

It's a good spot to go to if you want some food I recommend you try it and don't worry about it being in a gas station."}
{"text":"Great pulled pork and jumbo is huge. Stew is authentic. But the brisket is awesome!  Good Q  sauces  Fries were really good too. Tons of choices and can't wait to try them.  Good sweet tea. Get over the gas station concern. There is a dining area too. But yeah it's in a gas station."}
{"text":"Location: horrible. Service: good but didn't stand out. Food: Mac n cheese was ok, BBQ was a tad dry but with some sauce it was good. I don't crave it but would stop by if I wanted BBQ. Saucemans in uptown puts these guys to shame... Not to mention last time I was here, they forgot part of my order, when I called, they said they would add it on my next order... Problem being I don't want a next order really..."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find this restuarant in a gas station as well. My friend recommended them so I stopped in to give a try. The owner was very friendly and offered samples so that I could pick a side. As we chatted I found out that he makes most of his sauces/dressings from scratch. He also talked about his process for making baked beans and it sounds like they are truly made with love. He obviously cares about food and goes through a lot of trouble to make things from scratch when many businesses just order premade stuff. The BBQ was really good and had a great smoked flavor. We got one vinger based and one western. I definetly preferred the vinger based. It was put on a large well made bun and the bun is toasted to keep the sauce from making the bun mushy. I tried a lot of sides so here is my opinion of each of them:

Baked Beans - Extremely good could stand to be a tad bit sweeter they are a bit tangy.

Potato Salad - Very good standard potato salad. Better than the pre-made stuff from the grocery store, but I have had better. Maybe just a bit heavy on the mayo.

Pasta Salad - That stuff hits the spot!!! It is SERIOUSLY good!!! The noodels are 
al dente. and the sauces surrounding it are liquid gold!

Antipasti Pasta Salad - This was VERY GOOD, but a bit acidic. It has bits of italian meats, cheese, and veggies in a homemade vingerette. 

Potato Wedges - They are smaller than most of the ones I have and darn good!

Onion Rings - Run of the mill frozen kind, not quite up my alley. They are so easy to  make from scratch and worth the time.  I highly recommend taking the time to do this..... If the owner is trying to get more than the gas station crowd. Otherwise they'll do. 

Mac & Cheese - I didn't get to try this but did get to watch him make it. I consider myself a mac and cheese expert! Seriously anyone that knows me will assure you that I am a the biggest cheese head ever! He knows how to make it! I didn't have to eat it to know that it was going to be one soulful bowl of comfort food. 

All and all the food was great and I am going to use this for catering a party! They have great prices if you are looking for a casual meal for a party as well."}
{"text":"Always excellent food and quick service.  I can't lie - the ambiance leaves a little to be desired, but you won't find better BBQ in Harrisburg!"}
{"text":"Easily the best BBQ I've ever had. So friendly and know who you are after a few visits. The mac and cheese is good but the sweet potato wedges are to die for. SO good. I always get a small BBQ sandwich and a side and it is sure to fill me up. Plus the sweet tea is awesommmmeeeee! just make sure you ask for a cup when you order. Before moving, I was traveling from Uptown to Harrisburg almost once a week for this BBQ. its just THAT good! :-P"}
