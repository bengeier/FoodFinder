{"text":"My name is Adam and I work I'm the industry.  I went to Ceilis last night (Wednesday January 4) with some buddies for their wing night.  I was expecting the regular wings you would find for 25 cents but was surprised to find high quality food and a lot of sauce choices.  The mixtures of hot and a flavor were my favorite.  The manager told us to try their 'swings' which are a braised pork rib.  For $1.50 you get one but they're pretty big.  We ordered 6 and then ended up ordering 6 more... I'm definitely hooked on those it's nice to find something different than the usual cheap pints and cheap food.  Our waitress was awesome too lots of fun and recommended we come back for the weekend."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Ceili's for dinner and drinks. It happened to be Lobsterfest, and the place was pretty packed. We didn't have Lobsterfest tickets, so we ordered from their regular menu.  The service was great. We were served quite promptly considering how packed it was, and the waitresses were friendly.  The beer selection is good, but pricey. The cheapest pints are $6.75.  My food was disappointing. I ordered the veggie burger with a side order of onion rings. The patty was heavily seasoned with curry, which is not mentioned in the description. The curry really did not go well with the very sweet and overwhelming pear chutney. The bun was very dense, and the entire burger was really dry. There was some melted brie, but not enough to provide moisture. The onion rings had a very sweet batter, and literally it tasted like a donut with onion in the middle.  This was my first time at this pub. I might come back for drinks since I live nearby, but likely not the food."}
{"text":"Popped in for supper at the Southland location last night, first time here (and the last). We won't be back, while the young waitress's were pretty to look at thats all they had going for them, very unprofessional to the point of being rude.  The food was mediocre at best, you can do better for half the price.  Service: 1 star (our waitress was a real ditz) Ambiance: 2 stars (casual setting, a bit noisy) Cleanliness:  3 stars (appeared to be clean) Food: 1 star (factory food, bland, all tasted the same) Price: 1 star (very overpriced, 6oz. steak sand $17.75 / bowl of soup $7.75)  I should add my wife had fish & chips, both the fish and chips were the frozen type you would buy from co-op or safeway.  (1/2 order fish for $11.75 and she got one frozen fish stick and a handful of shoestring fry's, not impressed!)"}
{"text":"Great traditional pub foods with excellent attention to quality. Amazing friendly service, and attentive management. Good selection on tap. If there was a pool table I might never leave."}
{"text":"BEER PONG ON NEW YEARS EVE? Instant 5* if this is not a one night thing."}
{"text":"When we first entered Celili's we were ignored for over ten minutes before we decided to switch to a different section.  Once we moved into Amber's section she was a great server and the food was AMAZING!  I highly suggest that if you enjoy a good bangers and champ (\"mash\") this is the best I've found in the city!  While  I had a great time and enjoyed great food I will definitely ask to be seated in Amber's section next time I go to ensure  I get great service as well."}
{"text":"Alright, I am a frequent drinker at this establishment so I never have a problem with service, though I can definitely see where other people might differ in opinion. The girls can be a little wrapped up in their own worlds at times and when you aren't familiar with them.... Well...  The drinks are pretty expensive. I ordered two pints of Kokanee and that came out to something like $13.50, which is a litter ridiculous for domestic, especially when the glasses aren't even frosty.  The staff themselves are, once again, not the best. They are polite and easy on the eyes, though it must be noted that the waitresses seem to be clones of one another so that makes it hard to distinguish who your waitress is. There are a few that stand out though as I have been encouraged to dance on the bars with them many a times with them or had them hold a beer bong for me... yes they have a beer bong.  The food there is decent to delicious, depending on what you are getting. The fries and champ are really yummy, as are their burgers. Their wings are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside which is how I like them, but their flavour selection is greatly lacking.  I would recommend this place if you are looking for a crazy night of fun on a Friday or Saturday. They can get pretty packed and the atmosphere is awesome. Not the best bar in the world but one I still greatly enjoy."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips! Service was friendly and excellent. They lost one star because of the bathroom cleanliness. Toilets were dirty."}
{"text":"Update: They DONT serve Fruli anymore. What the eff? They took it off their menu. They still have delicious onion rings, but their lack of fruit beers is a dealbreaker for quasi-beer drinkers like me."}
{"text":"On very short notice, due to a mix up with our previously booked location, Ceili's were able to fit us in for our company Christmas party. Justin, the GM, was nothing but attentive to the needs of our group and the realities we faced with cost. I cannot thank them enough for all the work they put in through the night to make sure everything went off without a hitch. I have had nothing but positive feedback from the guys in my department and all have said they had a much better time then last years event.   The venue and food were great and exactly what we needed. The menu for events is slightly different to regular night and was just that grade above regular pub but not enough to be too fancy for everyone to enjoy. We had the raised area to ourselves with our own bar and it made for a seamless evening.  We will absolutely be keeping them in mind for future events!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday. They treated the birthday girl well and my sweet potato fries were delicious. Drinks were reasonably priced and the guy playing early 90's grunge covers on his guitar wasn't half bad.  I ordered their veggie burger and they told me they were out. When there's nothing else for vegetarians/vegans to order aside from the sides, that's something a restaurant should take note of. It was a Friday night and I came in around 8pm. I could understand if they were out if I rolled in around kitchen closing time, but... yeah. Glad I wasn't that hungry! Also, I ordered a shot of espresso vodka and it was served at room temperature. Might just be a nit-picky thing, but I've never ordered espresso vodka and had it served at room temperature; it's always served ice cold. Lastly, after the guitar guy left, the DJ spun a pretty ADD mix that had no flow, consistency and his attempts at beat matching were kinda heinous.   Go here if you're not expecting much."}
{"text":"It was funny I got a Groupon for this place, went and sat on the Patio and pulled out my iPhone to check in on the Yelp App. I started reading the reviews and didn't believe them. The pub seemed very busy, there was live music and it looked like a great place.  Well then it took 20 min for a waitress to even notice us; actually if I had not flagged her down I think it would have been 45min. 20 min for our drinks to come, and another 45 min for the food to come. The food was decent for pub food, but the service was horrible.  I agree with the other yelper's I think this was the worst service I have had in over a two years.  I had the Chicken Club (Chicken, tomato, bacon on sun-dried tomato bread) with coarse salt and black pepper fries. I liked it a lot; the bread really made the sandwich and the fries were different - I liked them with the pepper.   For dessert we ordered the banana toffee pudding. 25 min later the waitress came back to tell us that item was sold out. Not impressed.  last thing that annoyed me was they refused my Groupon via the mobile App. They insisted I print it. I had to talk to the manager and I flat out refused to pay them and told them to review the contract they signed with Groupon when they agreed to do the promotion. Finally after 5 min of arguing he gave in and made it work.  So seriously folks - stay away!"}
{"text":"Went to the southland location for the first time (AND THE LAST)  POOR SERVICE MEDIOCRE FOOD  RUDE EMPLOYEES  - Not to mention one of the huge meat-head bouncers beating up on some young guy half the size of him.. ( no one deserves a brual beating like that.. Especially AT A PUB) a place that people gather to eat have a few beers and want to have a good time!  Overall not a very good experience for a first timer and not at all interested in going back. EVER.   Good thing for places like LIMERICK'S where customers always feel welcome, never threated and you know the food is always good.. and on time! Cheers ;)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here recently for dinner.  I'd love to comment on the food, but I can't because we were never served.  This is a \"seat yourself\" restaurant, which is fine if the staff are competent, but you really shouldn't allow customers to seat themselves if you're not going to walk around once and a while to look for new customers.  We sat down near to the bar.  There were two bartenders, and I'm certain that they saw us; I made eye contact with one of them several times.  Neither of them informed any of the servers to our presence, though, and although a few servers walked by near enough that they should have seen us, nobody talked to us at all.  After what must have been at least 20 minutes, we gave up and left.  Now, I imagine some people might say that we should've gotten up and flagged someone down, so let me address that.  Yes, we could have.  But  if the servers are so bad that they didn't even notice us, then I very much doubt that the service throughout the meal would've been even half decent, so we decided to go to an establishment that would actually respect our patronage.  Judging by Emma G's review, I think it was the right decision.  In conclusion, don't go to this restaurant if you like to, you know, be served when you go out to eat."}
{"text":"My first meal in Canada and somehow I ended up in an Irish-styled restaurant/pub. It had that \"Friday's\"/\"Tuesday's\" feel, but this is definitely not part of a large chain.  Seating myself at a high top, I had a good view of the 18 or so beers on tap. On Sunday, a $6 \"featured\" pint was the drink special and this time it was Rolling Rock. Odd to have American beer in an Irish restaurant in Canada, but whatever. And looking over the menu, the Shepherd's Pie caught my eye. Made with lamb instead of beef. When it arrived from the kitchen, it was super hot and really quite good. Plenty of tasty ground lamb in there and lots of potatoes and for some reason, melted cheese on top. I'm not complaining, it was delicious.  Good service from the waitstaff, who for some reason wear boots, tight and low tops and extremely short tartan skirts. That makes sense for some reason.  Free wifi worked great. I didn't look hard for power, I used my laptop battery running out as my excuse to head onwards. Good seating outside. It's June now, I think you're probably not going to want to sit out there in December. :-)  I'm not sure why there are so many poor reviews, I thought the place was A-OK."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying neither of these happened during Stampede:  I've been to this establishment twice.  Neither time was at all busy.  The first, I was meeting a friend for drinks. I told the hostess (though I'm not sure that's what she was) this and she sat me at a table. And not one single staff member came anywhere near me. I waited for my friend to show up, and they ended up running late, so after well over a half hour, I got up to leave.  The same hostess asked me why I was leaving, and I told her that I hadn't even seen a staff member since she sat me at the table. So as I walked out, she asked me if a free drink would make me change my mind.  I said no, because I should have been offered a drink far earlier.  There was no apology, just the offer of a free drink. I walked across the parking lot to Jack Astors and got treated great, including a free round for my friend and I, for my troubles when I explained to them what happened at Ceili's.  My next visit was simply as I was wandering the neighbourhood, as I am new to Calgary, and moved to the area.  I thought I'd give it one more try. Well I walked in and it looked like there was nobody in the bar at all, other than a DJ playing 80s rap.  I walked up to the bar and sat down, and the bartender must have been cleaning or something because he popped up from below the bar as I pulled up a chair.  Other than that I didn't get a word from him.  And after the frat boys and what I think were the waitresses came in from the patio with the beer bong, I was pretty much ignored. I had my one beer, and left.  I pretty much never give second chances, and Ceili's makes me regret doing so this time."}
