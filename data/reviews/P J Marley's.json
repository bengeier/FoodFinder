{"text":"Slow service appears to continue to be a common theme for PJM.  Went over the weekend for breakfast and the place was pretty much empty when we arrived.  I thought that might help but it actually ended up being the slowest service of any visit.  As other people arrived I noticed they were getting their meals and coffee before us.  One of our orders wasn't entered resulting in more of a delay.  They were kind enough to comp that item but we felt like we were constantly having to track down or waitress for refills, to pay the bill, etc. We really like their menu but the service really needs help."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on a Saturday night about 7:30. Had about a 15 min wait. Not bad! He ordered the burger with Bleu cheese and apples and I had the burger with Mac and cheese. Both delicious.! Nice twist. We chose draft beer. I like my beer really cold. This was cool. Not icy cold. Not a deal breaker. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Some people like this place. I have trouble figuring out why. Been there twice. Their burgers were big, overcooked and unseasoned as far as I could tell. Giant yawn.   But safe, I'm sure. And the waitress was attractive. [Maybe a little salt and pepper on the hamburger, at least?]"}
{"text":"This review makes me sad to write because i usually love this place. Service is normally slow, but tonight was a case of being deliberately ignored. We sat in the bar area and were served by Beth, who seemed friendly enough. We ordered our drinks and food at the same time. The jalepeno bites came out very fast. Then, Beth didnt check on us at all. I asked another server to refill our waters and bring another side of ranch (which he was awesome about). Eventually, when my first glass of wine was finished about 25-30 mins later, Beth came to ask if we needed another. I said sure and asked if the kitchen was backed up since our food was taking a while. She had a very long pause and then gave a generic excuse about them being busy. Magically not even a minute later our food came out and all of it was cold. It had clearly all been sitting under a heat lamp for a very long time, to the point where my grilled cheese was soggy. She came to ask how our food was and when i said \"its ok...\" she said \"ok good\" and walked away. It is very difficult for me to leave a low tip and i am a patient customer, but tonight i left a very low tip and was very disappointed. Oh and the nice gentleman that brought us extra ranch was the one that ended up having to check us out since Beth never returned to our table after bringing our checks."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times, always for the burgers. They are tasty and the sides and toppings are always just as good. Service is a bit slow and odd, almost like they don't dedicate front of house from wait staff. Otherwise, I highly recommend for the burgers!"}
{"text":"The staff here was pretty amazing.  When we walked in I saw that offered omelets during brunch but we were 30 mins after it  ended. I asked the host if it was possible to still get an omelet and he spoke with cook and confirmed that they could do that for me. Point 1 for PJ's! The waitress was also amazing never once did my coffee mug get empty. She was spot on with anything we needed and didn't miss a beat as I ordered. And anyone who knows me knows I love my special orders. Point 2 PJ's!! Great job and I will return again..oh and I can't forget that it looks pretty darn cool inside."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very cool. There were not many healthy options or salads.  My husband & son loved the burgers.  If you like unique burgers, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and am never disappointed. I've tried several dishes and all were equally delicious. I'm a major fan of their pickle chips. Extra points for hosting open mic nights for up and coming artists in the northeast Ohio area-keep it up! You can't beat their prices on specialty drinks. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Been here lots of times since they opened, food is always good and the staff is always friendly.  The time it takes to get food does vary with no real explanation (can be real busy and food comes out quickly or take longer).  Good beer selection and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fabulous burgers. The pickle chips were the best. Friendly service in a timely manner. Nice owner. Great mac and cheese. Wish i would've had room for the bread pudding, but the portion sizes of our meals and appetizer were enormous.  Will definitely be back.  And did i mention they had $1.99 bud lights on a Saturday evening??"}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner on 9/11 the day before the official opening. The building had a Victorian feel to it, tin ceiling, a large bank vault in the middle of the room, crown molding. The booth was very comfortable. The food was outstanding!  The three of us had burgers. They were cooked as requested the fries were double cooked and crispy.  The house made pickles were crisp and delicious.  The bar had a nice selection of beer on tap and bottled. Troy was our waiter he took great care of us. There was live music, an open mic night and the volume was just loud enough."}
{"text":"Great service from Liam and good food!  A nice place for some good food and live entertainment. Liam took special care to avoid my onion allergy."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat if you are in the mood for pub food.  Located in a former bank built in the 1800s on the Medina town square, the atmosphere is great.  The safe from the bank sits in the middle.  I had the Safe Cracker burger that had bacon, Mac and cheese, and a special house sauce on a pretzel bun.  It was fantastic.  The staff was courteous and prices were reasonable.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant that made me sign up for yelp so I could write a review. Excellent food, service and atmosphere. Loved it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch, first time here, Good burgers, cold beer, wait staff slow, will try it again soon"}
{"text":"Five of us decided to try the burgers at P.J.'s the other night. Had read other reviews about slow service so was a bit apprehensive, but I can tell you that there was absolutely no slow-down when we were there. O.K., they weren't overly crowded as Ohio State was kicking off against Penn State in a few hours. But the service was spot-on and the staff was friendly and polite. All I can say is we had a great time.  Burgers come as either 1/3 or 1/2 pound sizes, your choice. Two of us had the half pounders and three went with the third pounders. Both are served on a large, beautifully toasted bun. All come with fries as a side. My choice that day was the Big Foot. As I mentioned it was one-half pound of fresh, locally sourced beef with bacon, smoked cheddar, house-made pickles, spicy ketchup and topped with a fried egg. If you don't like \"hot\" get the pickles on the side as they taste like they are made in jalapeno pepper brine. They are sliced very thin and delicious, IF you enjoy some heat on your burger. And while the menu didn't mention it mine came with lettuce and slices of red onion. The house prepares all burgers medium-well unless otherwise requested. I suggest you go with the house, as my burger was still a bit pink inside even at medium-well.  So, the fries were fantastic. Very tasty. So was the beef. The burger was very moist, dripping goodness onto the plate at every bite. Thankfully the bun was so well toasted and large enough that it held up for the entire meal. They provided us with extra napkins anyway. At $11.99 for the Big Foot, P.J. Marley's is entering the same price range as other high-end burger joints. But their burgers are equal in quality to most of them, and better than some.  So why didn't I give it five stars? Well, there was one problem with my burger that I just could not let slip by. The fried egg was cooked just a tiny bit too long. The yolk was soft and shinny; it had not yet been cooked into a rubbery consistency. But it was NOT runny. A fried egg MUST be runny. That's the only reason to order one on a burger ... to bite into it and have the yolk drip down into the burger. If you prefer rubber yolks you should save some money and go to the place with the arches!  Their deserts looked fantastic. Probably worth trying if you are still hungry after your meal ... which none of us were. One person tried a milkshake but said it didn't have a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"Good start...supposed to be adding to the menu, which should be a good thing. Great grown up mac & cheese, burgers, fair fries & o-rings. Nice service from Robin."}
{"text":"All I had was a burger & onion rings, but that was enough to satisfy my hungry belly. I travel all over trying out different burgers & have to say the Buckeye Buck burger has instantly shot into my top 3. Simple & delicious. I was full but could have eaten a second. Very impressed. Can't wait to try a different variant"}
{"text":"Cool location, but we haven't had any amazing food experiences here. Their fries and wraps are good. We stopped by at 11 on a Sunday recently, and we're disappointed to find out that we could only order off the breakfast/brunch menu.  Their breakfast was nothing special. Also, FYI, they won't allow you to leave a tip with a gift card."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Service is always top notch. Pretty cool atmosphere. Nothing really to complain about. It's kinda weird that they only have milkshakes when they're \"in season\", whatever the hell that means lol, but oh well."}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome. Beer is great. Bar staff is ok. Good at serving a drink but not very inviting. Doesn't make you feel like staying for more than a drink."}
{"text":"Been there twice now. We couldn't wait to come back. Best burgers!!! The Medina burger is absolutely amazing. And the fries!!! The place is clean and service fast and VERY friendly. We are definitely coming back! Ps. Only thing missing is a burger with Bree cheese!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here based on the rating/reviews. The service was great and they have Vernor's ginger ale (the best) in their soda fountain, but unfortunately the wings and burger my friends and I ordered were so greasy they couldn't be eaten. Our female server was great about comping the wings."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner. Son in law & husband had burgers. My son in law said he thought it was the best burger he's had. I think he talked about it all night!  He had the one with an egg on it. I had the chicken sandwich,  it was really good too. Daughter had a country grilled cheese sandwich that was so big, she took 1/2 home.  The onion rings were the size of small tires!! My favorite was the bread pudding! Yum! Yum! Yum! Really cool because the place was an old bank & you can eat in the vault! Good service! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Great location and I like the menu. Just make sure you aren't in a rush since PJ's gives you plenty of time and never are in a hurry to take your order or prepare your food. If you have kids they will enjoy sitting at the table inside the vault. (This was a bank back in the day so they cleverly incorporated the vault into the interior design.)"}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to give this new place a try (on the advice of a fellow foodie from work).  He raved about their burgers, so we felt up for the challenge.  We ordered two burger platters and split them (to share / sample).  We ordered a Longmire (bacon, cheddar, onion rings, BBQ sauce) and the President Carter (topped with chunky peanut butter).  The Longmire was cooked to perfection, juicy and tasty.  The President Carter was not really my style (even though i love peanut butter) but the burger and bun (pretzel) were very good.  We ordered one burger with fries and the other with onion rings...both were a tad greasy but tasted great, especially the thick-cut rings.  Drink prices were reasonable and the space where the restuarant is located (an old bank building including vault as a private seating area) was well put together.  I'm not sure I'd make a special trip back down to Medina just for this place, but if I'm in the are again and looking for a casual place for good eats, this would be a good choice."}
{"text":"I believe I found a new place to get dinner in medina. I have to say this place has really changed a lot. When this place first opened in the medina the food was not the best as in not warm at all are waiter was not friendly at all.   Tonight I went to pj Marley's for a family birthday dinner the food was awesome out of this world I highly recommended the breakfast burger with the maple syrup on the side note be careful you might need a fork the egg is runny. If you had the brunch burger at Applebee's this is even better than Applebee's   The next time your hanging around medina or passing through looking for a place to eat check out pj Marley's. I will definitely look forward to coming back pj Marley's and recommending this place to friends and family but also to others."}
{"text":"Really great environment in the Medina square. Food and service were both good. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We hit this restaurant on a Sunday when there weren't too many options in the area and weren't disappointed. A quick check on the website gave the background of the building ( a bank since 1891, recently closed in 2013) so the vault in the middle of the place is legit and not some kitschy add on feature. (According to the website, you can make reservations to dine inside the vault. It looked nice and private but would make me a tad claustrophobic).   We started with the beet sliders and weren't impressed. Literally a beet slice on a bun with onions and sauce....nah, won't be ordering that again.   For the main course, I went with the bbq Hawaiian chicken wrap which was pretty good, just a tad heavy on the sauce. The fries were spiced well and were nice and crispy.   My husband built a burger and enjoyed his selection.   For dessert, we went with the chocolate cake with ice cream. (Apparently made by Grandma Ledo I believe, whoever that is). It was delicious...with a fudgy peanut butter situation on top. My only complaint is that it was huge and the smaller portion was recently removed from the menu according to our waitress. I'm a big proponent of small portion desserts because I hate to waste food and the gigantic portions at most places are enough to feed a family of four. *steps off soap box*   Overall, I enjoyed my experience at this establishment and would return."}
{"text":"Danielle, who doesn't eat beef, has been asking me to go to P.J. Marley's for a while now and, to be honest, i didn't feel like driving to Medina for a burger. Friday, however, we braved the awful weather and treacherous roads. I'm kinda glad we did.   While I will likely never accept being seated at one of the high tops in the bar due to be bumped into the entire time i sat there due to the large number of people squeezed into that relatively small area, i will gladly go back and wait to sit at a booth.  Danielle had a taco salad, which was basically a bed of lettuce with chili, cheese and onions. not really a taco salad but she liked it nonetheless.   I had a cup of chili, a 1/3 lb Big Foot burger and onion rings. The chili was good. The onion rings as well. The Burger was phenomenal. spicy ketchup, bacon, pickles, onion, lettuce, tomato, fried egg and smoked cheddar w/ probably the sweetest, best tasting beef patty I can ever remember having on a brioche bun (you can get a pretzel bun also).   The food is really good and if you're in the area I think it's a great idea to check out P.J. Marley's for a delicious burger and a cold beer."}
{"text":"We found ourselves in Medina. Decided to look for a place to eat dinner.  Went on Yelp found PJ's. encouraged by the good reviews. Decided to try.   Cool space. Old bank. Done up very cool. Sat at the bar. Watched the Tribe game and ordered dinner and drinks. They have root beer on tap. That's kinda cool. So ordered it. Also my friend had a McKenzies cider that's great not many bars carry McKenzies. So far so good!   Got 2 burgers with pretzel buns and opted for the homemade onion rings over fries. You have a choice between 1/3 # and 1/2 #. I and my friend got the 1/3#. Burger was good. Very tastee. Good flavor. The only real down point was the pretzel bun. It was too big. Too much bread. Had to pull some of it off the burger. Maybe the 1/2 # the proportion is better with bread to burger ratio.  Shoutout to the onion rings. They were really good. Great choice.    All in all good experience. I'd go back. Try something else. Definitely worth a stop! Just go for larger burger to not have so much bread. LOL!"}
{"text":"Forgotten by the waitress and a extremely well done burger ( ordered medium) made for a disappointing lunch"}
{"text":"Have been here several times now. ALWAYS good food and good service. The pretZel bun is def the way to go! Love the fries and onion rings too! Tonite I had the patty burger (Swiss, mushrooms and grilled onions) burger done to perfection. My husband chose his own toppings which included smoked cheddar and raw onions. I also like that you have your choice of 1/3 or 1/2 lb burger.  Would like to try other entrees but can't get past those delicious burgers! The only slight, and I mean slight, non-positive comment would be having to sit near the restrooms. Had never been in the back room before. Now we know where not to sit."}
{"text":"First off, this review is actually a 3.5 star rating but I still have not been able to find out how to do a half of star add on to the rating. (if anybody knows please let me in on the secret)  Anyways took the family out to eat a little while back (Few weeks) and thought as we love a good burger lets give PJ Marley's a try as we have heard good things.  We arrived around 5:15 on a Thursday and I can say we got there just in time as the crowd starting pouring in.   My wife ordered a 1/3lb \"Buckeye Burger\" on a pretzel bun (House made Bourbon sauce and Bacon top this burger along with White Cheddar and fresh red onion) with extra crispy fries. I ordered a 1/3lb \"Longmire Burger\" on a pretzel bun (This burger features bacon, smoked cheddar, onion rings and BBQ sauce) with onion rings and the wife and I did split a side order of mac and cheese. My daughter order a \"Mac Daddy GC\" (Swiss, American, Mac-N-Cheese and bacon, minus the bacon.) with fries (can you believe without the bacon, go figure, kids!).   As far as the food that we had is concerned it was solid all the way around. the burgers were juicy (cooked medium). The pretzel buns were a little too dense and were cool in the middle. The toppings and condiments were of good quality, but the sauces could have been a little more prevalent as you could barely taste they were on the burgers. As far as the size of the burger they are quite filling (even for the 1/3lb), although you may have to smash them down to be able to fit it in your mouth (which makes them a touch messy). The side of mac and cheese was nice and creamy but the only real cheese flavor that came through was the un-melted grated cheddar that was dumped on top. My daughters \"Mac Daddy GC\" was actually a nice blend and amount of cheeses with the texture of the pasta, toasted really nice to a melty and gooey consistency (good solid choice anytime). My wife's french fries were nicely crisp and had good seasoning, but my onion rings unfortunately had an old fryer oil taste and greasy texture to them.   Service was just standard (nothing memorable good or bad,) which I was OK with as busy as this place was.  Atmosphere is casual yet pretty cool to see how they have converted the bank into a restaurant. You can even eat inside the old vault. Can be noisy when busy.  We definitely will try it again when hungry and in the area to try some of their other menu offerings."}
{"text":"They have stellar burgers. Great hangout spot on the square. Come early because the seats fill up quickly! Great service as well!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place.  I've been here 3 times and it's is ridiculously slow.   Zero service."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game! Beer selection and Buckeye Buck Burger were exceptional. Service was very friendly, bartender Morgan was really helpful (and patient) with beer selection. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Made an effort to get there for a quick bite and a glass of wine . Looked good on the website. Wasn't sure which wine to pick and asked if I could taste the house cabernet and was told they don't allow tasting of wine as per their policy. I ordered a glass of red anyways since we were already there and regretted not liking it and it was a total waste of our time , effort and money. Would never reommend this place. Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place with awesome bank vault in middle of room.  Unique menu had several items I wanted.  Had small onion ring appetizer.. what a deal!  Chicken philly wrap was great.. packed and cooked perfect.  Beet sliders were cool.  Fries done right.  Donkey Sauce (you heard right!) was really good, but BBQ sauce was the bomb!  Great service too. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Medina. Whole family enjoyed. I especially loved the black bean burger. I don't think it's always available but for a vegetarian like me, I'd say it's the best around here"}
{"text":"This was our 1st visit on a Lenten Friday looking forward to a fish fry. We ordered the pollack which was the only deep fried fish What we got was 3 pieces of grocery store frozen fish!!!!  The \"French fries appetizer\" with cheese sauce and bacon pieces was mush!  The cole slaw was horrible with big chunks of cabbage ( not precooked) and big chunks of onions. We opted out of dessert Honestly I've had better Giant Eagle frozen fish. The only reason this place gets 2 stars is the flavored hard cider (mckensies)) was really good. I had 2! Will not return"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while in town I have to say great atmosphere, burger were GREAT service was very good. If your in Medina craving a good burger this is the spot don't miss it."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing burgers!! And lots of choices with really unique toppings and sauces. I also recommend the fried pickles, they were a awesome. Great atmosphere and service as well! They also had a good kids menu to choose from, our little guy loved their homemade chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"I have to give it to PJ Marley's, Besides the takeout being ready exactly 12 minutes after being ordered the veggie Medinos (soft tacos) blue chips, french fries and chicken salad were all finely cooked. I definitely recommend stopping in if you're passing through Medina.    - Timely service - Take-out / Dine in option  - Debit/ Credit cards accepted- Low price to food quality - vegetarian options"}
{"text":"Love it.  Our favorite local watering hole.  Great rotating beers on tap, great burgers, ok appetizers, but always great daily drink specials....  And the bartenders are fabulous.  We always meet new people and just have a great time."}
{"text":"A new favorite place in Medina. Been several times, and really like the food. French Fries are quite good!  Wings are my go-to here. Burgers and more are also good.   Outdoor patio is great on a nice day."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on the square in Medina while out running errands.  We arrived after the normal lunch crowd and were the only ones in the place.  We were greeted with no enthusiasm and the wait staff seemed perturbed that we were there.  Our server was not at all friendly and it was our first time dining there.  The location is great and the restaurant's interior is really unique, including a bank vault.  Unfortunately, the food was just OK.  The meat in my burger tasted more like meat loaf than what I would expect for a burger joint.  I didn't really care for whatever seasonings were used.  Overall, it's not a place we would choose to visit again.  A disappointment to say the least."}
{"text":"I love their burgers. The Italian Stallion is my favorite. I think it must be grass fed beef bc it dries out fast so order a little less done than you usually order and you will love it.  I wish they had better salads though. We went for breakfast a few times. The sausage was the best I've had in my life!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something new and ventured to Medina square. Many quaint places. We decided on P.J.'s Marley's for a beverage and sandwich. Our server, Ashley, was phenomenal. Suggestions we're spot on. Have to recommend the Medina Reuben. Very up beat crowd and fun atmosphere. Definitely a return in order."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great bar, great burgers.  Best fresh cut fries I ever had.  The restaurant is in what used to be an old bank in downtown Medina.  The bank vault is still in the middle, I guess it's built into the building and would require demolishing the building to remove, but adds great atmosphere to the place.  You can even eat inside it.  Try the peanut butter burger, it may sound weird but it really works."}
{"text":"I have lived in Medina for 6 months now and have been to PJ Marley's three times - the burgers ARE KILLER!  Fresh, local cows, nice & juicy.  The safecracker is my favorite with the mac n cheese and bacon.   Do try the house made pickles, fried or otherwise, they will not disappoint.   My only complaint is that they don't take reservations for the regular dining area unless you have a large party, and you can wait an extremely long time for a table."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner there, although we sat in the back which wasn't decorated like the rest of the place. Felt like we were in an add-on. However that didn't have an affect on this review. Had a cup of chili to start off with and the wife had fried pickles. The chili was amazing. Had a nice heat to it and the cheese and chopped onion on top gave it a nice taste. Not too heavy on the beans, and just right. It does have heat though. I'm not a big pickle fan and never saw the allure of fried pickles.  They weren't bad. Not much flavor to them but good.   My main entree was a Longmire Burger (sans tomato and lettuce). Asked for it Medium and it came out perfect. The flavor was perfect and the bun was toasted to perfection. It came with fresh hand cut French fries which were good. Not soaked in the frying oil and soggy, but crisp and ha d a great taste.   My wife had Patty's Favorite burger which she also enjoyed.   They had a wide selection of beers, which surprisingly my wife was able to find one she liked, considering she's not much of a beer person. I'm not one for the IPA's and stuck with a standard Bud Lite and a glass of water.   I will say, all of their beef is purchased locally according to their menu, which is a plus. I like going to places that support their local farmers.   For a first timer, I will say the food was great, the atmosphere was wonderful, and the service was awesome. Our waitress gave us suggestions on the menu and was on top of everything. Food came out hot and ready to eat. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant on a Wed night was not crowded at at.  Drinks are a little expensive,  no drink specials or Happy Hour.  I got the Buckeye Burger and it was cooked exactly the way I like it, had a side of onion rings they were awesome!  My husband got the Italian his was cooked the way he likes it and they were juicy and the taste was fresh... not like it was a frozen hockey puck cooked.  Everyone in our party had burgers so that's all we can comment on.  Place was clean, service was good.  Prices are a little high for burgers,  but I always pay more if it's fresh and since they use local meat I don't mind paying a little more.  If. it's made they exact way I order it.  Overall awesome first time.  Love the atmosphere,  love how they kept some of the old bank."}
{"text":"Post-show cast dinner time.  Perfect place right on the square in Medina.  Really good food and the service was excellent.  The accommodated a large group including kids and teens (cast members..)  Everyone got what they ordered and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first experience there.  Good food, good service, friendly staff & really appreciate the history behind the building & the architecture.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Medium rare burger ordered and bun came out super super soggy. I expect that at a place that doesn't advertise as a burger joint.  When I notified the waitress - they acted like I was crazy. It tasted ok but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Looking for a good burger for my night out with my teen son. We found it at PJ Marley's.  We decided to try this place after all the photos on Yelp. Very accurate. I had traditional cheeseburger. My son enjoyed the cowboy burger(I think that's what it was called) it had chili on it. He scrapped most of the chili off and made his own chili fries. Great prices, great portions. Only negative comment...CNN was on the tv. No one wants to watch the news, trying to enjoy a night out."}
{"text":"PJ Marley's isn't the worst restaurant I've been to, but it also just hasn't been very impressive to me.  I've been several times with friends and family and each time I left just feeling there were better choices out there.  The food to me has always been bland and if you have something with a dressing or topping its slathered on.  I also have yet to get french fries that were not burnt to a crisp, even after asking for a new batch.  Service is acceptable, not bad, not good.  Beer selection is alright as long as what you order is still in stock."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here - they do have some of the best onion rings I've ever had. The service, however, is terrible -- ridiculously (almost hilariously) slow."}
{"text":"This is a nice downtown Medina bar. You can take the whole family here. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I thought the food portions were small. Nice selection of food and not your typical bar food as they do have other options. The service was good. Not sure how the seating thing works, sometimes you seat yourself and sometimes you have to put your name on a list and that seems unorganized when there is large crowds."}
{"text":"Local spot, definitely fits the medina square vibe. Always an solid draft selection (actually gets more columbus bodhi than anywhere I know of).  Burgers are solid, always fresh.  The Chief is the way to go....chili, deep fried jalapeño on top of a 1/2lb burger.  I hear they have live entertainment on certain nights  as well!"}
{"text":"The service and appetizers were outstanding and 5 stars all the way; however, the burgers were disappointing.  My burger was ordered med well and was served as a charcoal briquette...the waitress alerted the manager but by the time he came and offered me a new one the rest of my party had finished eating. If you're going...stay away from the burgers (not only my burnt one but the other 2 in the party were not impressed) but definitely try the Rueben fries they are awesome!"}
{"text":"After waiting 45 minutes to get a table we waited another 45 minutes to get our food. 2 salads and a burger took way too long. We asked for grilled onions instead of raw and got raw anyway. Chicken on the salad was tough(over microwaved?) We were told the kitchen is \"really \" busy. Terrible excuse for bad service. They did take $2 off the burger but doesn't make up for the experience."}
{"text":"Recent trip to Medina on late Saturday afternoon.  Service was fast and friendly - no complaints there.  Unique decor and atmosphere.  We went for the burgers b/c of the rave reviews but all four adults left not happy with their burgers!  We all ordered a different specialty burger and fries (the fries are outstanding btw) but none of us cared for the texture of the burger.  Just a very weird color, texture and mouth feel.  They also use a seasoning mix on the burgers that we did not like either."}
{"text":"First time here, definitely coming back. Right from the start the service was great. Our server Krista was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food she said all the burgers were great and she was right we order that Buckeye buck and the Safecracker burgers. Excellent. Before that we started with an order of homemade onion rings, too full for dessert, but they sounded great. Nice atmosphere, right on Medina square. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Burgers are excellent. Ambiance is great as this old building is a bank with a visible vault. Menu isn't large so you want a burger if you come here but it will be really good and juicy. Great stop way from interstate. You will have to find street parking though as this is on the town square area and no lot parking."}
{"text":"This place was yummy!!!  The burgers were done exactly the way we asked. The mac and cheese was delicious and the onion rings were amazing   The price of a beer was kinda insane, but..."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Unfortunately, we waited 30 minutes for appetizers, that we ended up returning, because they weren't very good. Our server took our order, and we had to actually get up, and search for her to return our food and get our check. Terrible service, below average food. Will not return."}
{"text":"Very good spot. The wings are the best you can find in Medina for sure! Haven't tried the burgers yet, because the wings are too good to pass up on"}
{"text":"Cool little restaurant that used to be a bank in public square Medina. Really nice area! Fast, friendly service. The Donkey grilled cheese was soooo good! Swiss, American, feta, garlic aioli sauce, and I added bacon - yummmm! Burgers are huge! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Apparently the whole city of Medina shuts down on a Sunday night. Except P.J. Marley's.   I was in the area and after 2 failed attempts to get dinner at other local establishments, I saw that this place was open, was full of people, and also, as a bonus, had football on the bar area. That's not something that's overly important to me, but my dining companions were happy with that.  I'm not familiar with Medina, but even if my waitress hadn't told me that this restaurant was knew, I would have been able to tell. It even smelled new. And as with most new businesses, service can be a little off. Our waitress was very nice but disappeared for long periods of time. She failed to key in my special requests to veganize an item on the menu, but when my food came out \"wrong\" she was quick to correct it. Or at least she tried to be. To the restaurant's credit, everything is fresh on the menu, so food prep time does take a little longer.   My fiance tried the beet sliders and I've honestly never seen anything like them. I expected beet patties...but these babies were just a bun and a thick slice of beets. They were good but could have used something. Maybe a garnish? A sauce? Something?  I got the equivalent of a taco minus meat, cheese, and sauce so that they would be vegan. They were just ok.  My third dining companion got a big juicy burger. Some sort of Buckeye burger, I think? It was good, according to him, but it was messy. He definitely could have used some more napkins.   Overall, I had a fairly decent meal with some great company and would stop back in again. Especially once this restaurant has a chance to work out the kinks and refine their menu items a bit."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Medina square! Just moved out of that area and I was bummed that this came along AFTER I left. Oh well. Great burger, great space and very friendly service. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I wasn't impressed by the loaded nachos. The canned cheese wasn't too appetizing, would have preferred fresh toppings for the price. Overall, great experience. I'll be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant hands down. We get the same order every time we're there because we look so forward to it (Mac Daddy and Safecracker...Mac and cheese and bacon, on a bun??!? Yes please!). We try to make it there every Friday night to grab a beer and snack on some pickle chips. Greg, the bartender who's there on Fridays, is awesome! Bonus: they always have the games on so its just another reason to make it up there to enjoy some stellar burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Very glad we decided to stop in yesterday evening. Bartenders and waitresses were welcoming, friendly and attentive. The beer list was very nice and included multiple Christmas Ales. Ordered a burger which was cooked perfectly and delicious. Fries were plentiful and well seasoned. A must see in the square."}
{"text":"Uh-mazing! Love the local historic vibe and the food was DELISH! Staff was superb, food was fresh and everything you'd expect from a quality burger and that John Dillinger news clipping was FANTASTIC.  Def be back but will definitely make a reservation - because it was packed."}
{"text":"We took friends to this restaurant and walked out in shock.  We had 6:30 reservations...got seated, ordered drinks, had appetizers and got our food. Almost as we were taking our last bites (7:45) some guy came by and said we would have to pack up and leave because their 8:00 reservation was there!  I'm 63 years old, eat out lots, and I have NEVER had this happen!  If the food had been great, I might have been more amenable to being rushed out....but it wasn't!  Just to be clear, this is the first time I've written a bad review online.  Obviously, I'm less than happy with this experience!"}
{"text":"Food looked excellent but taste was just o.k. Service was awesome and kids are welcome. I would be willing to try it again but order something different next time."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place unfortunately it's just taking up space in the square. Their menu has like 10 items, no liquor, and their wine selection is very small. I ordered the longmire burger because it sounded delicious. The burger had zero flavor and was very dry. Also our table was literally right in front of the restroom doors. Overall.....not good. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. The hubby and I both got burgers and sat in the vault. We had reservations to sit in the vault, it was cool but the front door kept blowing in and it was chilly out, plus people are gawking at it while your trying to eat. Burgers were pretty good, prices decent. I think we will go back and I'll try the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day, our son took us there and was here the previous weekend and said it was good.  Not so today...service was poor..almost one hour to get our food with the waitress only coming around once to refill coffee. The eggs were over cooked, the bacon undercooked, toast cold but the one good thing on the plate were the hash browns. The place was not even full so there was no excuse.  Not sure I will ever give this place another go round!!  One star for the hash browns."}
{"text":"I just got a plain burger for take out and let me tell you about it. This burger is not your dad's burger... That is unless P.J. Marley is in fact your father. THIS burger was like an angel came down from heaven and brought a heard of cows with her to make the burger of the gods. Eating THIS burger was like having a conversation with God about how to make the best burger in the world. The pickles tasted as though Jesus pickled them, himself. Yes. The angel also brought down the heavenly Jesus pickes with her too... And pretzel buns... And all the other heavenly burger ingredients too. Then there were the French fries. The French fries were so good I swore that François Hollande, The president of France, cut down a forest of trees with an axe, used those trees to build a boat, sailed said boat across the Atlantic ocean and then walked to the kitchen of P.J. Marley's to hand cut the potatos and fry them himself... With the help of Jesus. If there is perfect form of hand cut french fries that exist, these are them. FACT. But the moral of the story is that this isn't JUST the best burger I have ever had, but the best burger in the world. Amen."}
{"text":"Good burgers and cool location. I had the Chief burger which on the menu they warned as being hot and spicy.... if you want it to actually have any spice order it with extra jalapenos... a little disappointed in the heat level."}
{"text":"I'm not from Medina but stopped here for a work lunch and wow! Found this place on yelp and thank goodness for that!!!  The food was just absolutely amazing. I got the donkey grilled cheese and just wow, knock my socks off. The waitress didn't have the best personality on earth.  She was all business. However, for the price and the food, definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Stopped by P J Marley's for a drink recently, during a late night search for an open bar. In Medina, finding an open bar that serves wine at 10 pm is not an easy task.  We watched the Cavs game, drank beer and wine, and ordered some deep fried goodness. We had deep fried onions and deep fried pickles. They were quite tasty! The waitress/bartender was fast and very friendly. What a great place!   We'll be back to try a burger soon."}
{"text":"Awesome family friendly pub style restaurant.  You can bring the kids, or come for adult pops with friends. Either way there's room for fun.   The burgers are fantastic.  There a several signature burgers that are incredible.  Portions are large, and prices are fair.   This is a regular spot for my family."}
{"text":"Called to place a carry out order at 7:50pm on a Tuesday (4/26). Person who answered phone placed me on hold for over 8 minutes. I could hear the person who answered phone talking in background during this time. I disconnected phone and called back several times, line was busy. Finally got thru and spoke with the owner/manager. She apologized but provided and excuse that they were busy and indicated that they do not a archaic phone service from the where you could place calls on hold? Surprised they were so busy at 8pm on a Tuesday and they can afford to remodel business but not upgrade phone service or properly train employees on how to handle phone calls. Too bad they offered such a lame excuse instead of accepting ownership of the issue. Beware of ordering take out... you may have to wait 10 minutes for someone to take your order. Not a very good business model :-("}
{"text":"My future MIL and I stopped in late on a Friday evening for some grub. I am in Medina Square every 8 weeks or so but I have honestly never seen or heard of this place. How long has it been there? Anyway, her friend has been raving about it, so we gave it a try.  My first impression was a pretty typical bar food establishment. It was nice and busy, but we were greeted immediately. We sat near the vault door and we both commented on the atmosphere. It was comfortable and casual.  The menu was almost overwhelming- there were so many things I wanted to try!  But once I saw something called donkey sauce, I knew I had to pick something with it. Our awesome waitress, Krista S. ran down the options which included it but also told me I could just get it as a side to dip fries in. Duh. She also cautioned me that it was addictive. (Donkey sauce is roasted garlic aioli)  Mom ordered the Hawaiian Chicken Wrap and she said it was really good. It was a nice size and had big, meaty pieces of chicken. I ordered the Italian Stallion - a fat, juicy burger topped with swiss, pastrami, grilled onions, Cleveland stadium mustard, ketchup, and house made pickles. This was one of the best burgers I've had in a while. The donkey sauce was an excellent addition to the crisp, delicious fries. Our meal was so satisfying, I kept eating after I was already full. THEN we talked about obviously coming back here for breakfast sometime. Perhaps sleeping there and just waiting for breakfast a few hours later?  Our bill for 2 sandwiches, 2 sides of donkey sauce, and 1 iced tea was only $22.92. That is a great value. By far, my favorite dining establishment in the Medina Square area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. It's an old bank. The vault is in the center of the restaurant and there is a table for dining in it.  Only been there twice but both times the burgers were really good. They have a number of specially burgers with out of the ordinary toppings (I.e. Mac and cheese, or chili).  The pickle chips were great."}
{"text":"Love the setting with the lovely old bank vault. Food is wonderful. Highly recommend the fried pickle chips. Light and tasty. I had the Medina Reuben sandwich with sriracha sauce. The staff was great and service was fast. Can't wait to check it out again."}
{"text":"Picked up a Longmire to go and it was really good.  The burger was well cooked and came with fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"Only have been here twice and both times ordered a burger. Its so hard not to, as they serve fresh made burgers! Bonus is the hand cut fries. Why any restaurant uses frozen is beyond me. I am happy with this place thus far and would recommend to burger lovers. Although its more than a 30min ride to get here, I will be back."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars    for their burgers and atmosphere! Where else can you chow on a delicious monster burger while you sit in a really old bank vault!!  Don't hesitate to check it out!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I happened to be in the area and were looking for a good, local burger. Parking was a little crazy, but there was something happening on the square the day we were in town.  We had a wonderful server, she was knowledgeable of the menu, super pleasant and very attentive to our needs - A+ when it comes to service.  She said the Mac N Cheese was the way to go, so we tried the buffalo Mac, and we are SOOOO glad we did - delicious! We didn't get crazy with our burger selection, but the meat was fresh and flavorful.  So very glad we stopped in and definitely a spot I'd like to visit again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers (\"best I've ever had\" according to my husband), delicious hand cut fries, and a mouth-watering dessert (bread pudding) is what was on our table from PJ Marleys last night. Great atmosphere and really great food. We will definitely be back!"}
