{"text":"A lovely greasy spoon. Don't let the name fool you there is much more than fish and chips to be had here, including my personal favourite: all day breakfast. They have a selection of fish and chips, sandwiches, souvlaki's and traditional diner fare. I can only vouch for the all day breakfast as that it what sucks me in each time I've set foot in this place.  $5.99 ($4.99 before 11am) for 3 eggs, toast, home fries, coffee and choice of breakfast meat. That's a lot of food for not a lot of money. Though not blow-your-mind-delicious, the breakfast is a step above adequate and more than filled the cavernous void that is my stomach.  Well worth a stop if you're passing along Lakeshore or happen to work in the area, as I do."}
{"text":"Very slightly undercooked (both fish and chips), but still very good. Huge chips portions, haddock pieces very small so 2 piece order came with three. Very quick and friendly service. One of the few fish & chip places open on sunday. Nice jazz tunes played at a reasonable volume."}
{"text":"Just stay away. By all means.  Unless you enjoy the company of hearing the management scream at one another and even every now and then at the customers.   The oil is never changed, the prices just keep going up and the food quality goes down.   It's dirty. Stay away. Save your money."}
{"text":"Well, I wouldn't go here with high culinary expectations - but if you want a quick $7 dollar breakfast served on cafeteria trays with sort of old bacon and some over easy eggs, this may just be your spot. You can be in and out within 10 minutes. There's some language barriers you may have to get through with the cashier, so just don't make customizations to your order and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Friends Fish and Chips is about as good as you can get when it comes to eating at a \"greasy spoon\". I say that as someone who's gone many times, for casual meetings and the like.  If you're put off by the sight of drunken men trying to wake themselves up after the previous night's hangover, ratty-looking women using the bathroom or the day's newspapers strewn haphazardly around tables, this probably isn't the place for you. Lakeview attracts a certain... caliber of people, and I don't think I'm remiss when I say that this is the type of place that appeals to older individuals looking for cheap, quick food.  The breakfast specials are usually decent - as said below, it's about $6 for 3 eggs, grits, toast, ham/bacon and coffee. The rest of the menu ranges from decent to somewhat overpriced, although the portions are generous. The quality can go either way - I've had fries that have run the gamut from delicious to bland and unappealing. Some of the sides are also pretty crazy - the coleslaw looks to be either refrigerated or fermented, and the tartar sauce is the same off-color green stuff you'd find at dive bars.  I usually get the club sandwich - it's nothing to write home about (the toast is usually limp), but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"If you like fries that taste like onion rings and onion rings that taste like fish this is the place to visit.   I had tried many fish & chip places before but I never had food drip with oil the way this place makes it.  The oil is BLACK! So that explains everything tasting the same   Oh yea no debit or credit! Cash only!   Don't expect the service to be great ether, nothing more inviting than a grumpy Chinese lady behind the counter.   Very dirty!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a \"greasy spoon\" of a restaurant. If you can handle grease, you are good to go!!  I usually only come here on rare occasions to get fries and gravy. I LOVE their gravy, it's delicious!  The fries aren't cut fresh... But the gravy! Noms for sure.  They have a huge menu including what they call 'all day breakfast.' I've had the burgers here and the fish as well. I wasn't too fond of their fish as I usually go to Country fish and chips down the road.  The prices aren't very cheap, ie: Large plate of fries and gravy, $8.50!  But like I say, once in a blue moon I visit here.  The decor is really tacky fish restaurant decor and the restaurant could use some serious updating.  But the staff are very friendly, which is one of the reasons we come of course.  This place has been around a LONG time, I remember coming here as a child with my dad and we'd get fish and chips as a treat!   Ah Port Credit memories!"}
{"text":"New management. Its a great place now. Food is decent and reasonable priced."}
{"text":"This place was LITERALLY the filthiest looking fish and chip shop I've ever been to. I'm a fan of greasy spoons but the state of this restaurant had me genuinely concerned for my health. I had second thoughts about walking in but a \"PASS\" inspection notice posted proudly on their door gave me a false sense of reassurance and I just went for it.   What's even more absurd is their prices. Haddock fish and chips can run you a much as $15!   The food was generally poor in quality. The fish did not taste fresh, the coleslaw was tasteless and oily, the tartar sauce was basically mayo and relish, and the chips were limpy and greasy."}
