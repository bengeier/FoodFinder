{"text":"I disagree with some  of the reviews regarding the decor. It's called Victorian. Keep in mind that this place was started around the turn of the early twentieth century. I think it has a cozy feel to it, the smallness of the place adding to the coziness. While the food may be a bit overpriced with regard to the portions  (this is the norm for Little Italy), it is delicious nevertheless. Everything I've ever ordered there has been great. Being the first Italian restaurant in Cleveland and still going says something in itself that can't be argued with. Maybe not the trendiest place in Little Italy but something of an Old World charm that is hard to find in this neck of the woods. Would recommend anyone to at least give the place a try. I think the original Sicilian Guarino family who founded the place would be proud that it is still up and running. Try it and discover old-school Little Italy for yourself."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with my parents and my boyfriend. Then we moved to bar, parents left, we LOVED our bartender Andrew soooooo much. He was awesome, knowledgeable as hell, and also super friendly and fun. We got to hang with the owner for a bit and he showed us around the patio and had some nice chat time. I'm so happy we went there tonight!!!! Thanks for a great evening !!!!"}
{"text":"My first trip to Cleveland and Jack's came highly recomended and rightfully so. The place was busy but there was never a lack of service during the lunch rush. I ordered the Rueben and my fiancé had the Club. I am picky when it comes to Rueben's and this one was by far the best one I have ever had and my fiancé was impressed with his food as well. The portions are huge so come hungry. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the decor is dated but I didn't come for the decor."}
{"text":"After just moving to Cleveland, we decided to take a stroll through Little Italy so we could stop for lunch, and Guarino's was one of the only places open. It was lucky for us, because this has become our favorite! The cheese ravioli in marinara sauce tastes so fresh, absolutely homemade, very flavorful. The staff is always very friendly. Decor is a bit kitschy, yet oddly it gives this little restaurant a big dose of charm."}
{"text":"I lunch on the back patio.  The vibe was neat dining under well established foliage.  The wedding soup was very good which made up for the disappointing salad.  The eggplant role up was a good value and tasted great"}
{"text":"Amazing service, very friendly staff and lovely atmosphere. Will definitely be returning to this romantic spot with my boyfriend again soon! Great for dates or families.   We got to grab a table without much wait when a couple stormed out and said they hadn't even been brought water after 20 minutes. This was a bit off-putting, but we had a really great experience. Quick, attentive service from a very friendly waitress. The house dressing is fantastic and the prices are really reasonable for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Italian wedding soup had to be sent back cause it was lukewarm. Salad - nothing special Spaghetti and meatballs - ok but overpriced. Service - c+ Parking - A+"}
{"text":"The food was better than any chain italian restaurant. Average prices, no frills. Chairs could use some work, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"Very very friendly staff. Feels like youre at home. If you went in your pajamas, they would prob serve you cuz theyre that nice. The food is also good. I recommend the beef lasagna and baked fish"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars, I would. Service was awful. They forgot about our table and we had 3 different waiters none of which knew what they were doing. Our food was served to us on plastic plates with stale bread. We had to ask for oil so we could chew it. Save your money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Family run restaurant for years. We have met the owner and her daughter Rachel who go out of their way to make the experience pleasant. They have the best gluten free pasta we have ever had and were willing to make many dishes GF.  We had Chicken Picata and Chicken Parmesan.  Both were delicious.  They have their own parking lot which is definitely a plus, because Littly Italy was hopping last night.  I would agree with others that it is quaint and quirky, but if I wanted ordinary we would have eaten at Bob Evans.  Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner. The staff was very friendly. We will definitely come back on one of our visits with our college daughter."}
{"text":"It's Labor Day and unfortunately every restaurant in Little Italy is closed with the exception of Guarino's Restaurant.  Had never been to it before, and after eating there, will not be back.  Food is bad.  Italian wedding soup tasted and looked like chicken and stars with a few meatballs thrown in.  Eggplant parm tasted like frozen.  The decor was worth seeing and is the only thing memorable about it  - very old world.  Certainly a one and done."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. It's always good but not amazing. The inside is really old but that could be considered part if it's charm. There's a patio out back for when it's warm and Big Bonus: their own parking lot."}
{"text":"3 of us went to this restaurant right after thanksgiving. We ordered calamari for an appetizer and each of us had different kinds of pasta including linguine with clams, meatball spaghetti, and fettuccine alfredo. Calamari was great very crispy outside and soft inside, it was one of my best calamari ever. Pastas were not quite as expected-linguine was average, alfredo was beyond heavy and besides the server didn't mention there would be an extra $4 charge for adding chicken to alfredo. Ambiance was very cozy and romantic. If I happen to go back, I will try some other menus next time."}
{"text":"We had a nice leisurely family dinner on their patio. I ordered their lasagna, my husband got the manicotti, and my son got the gnocchi. I could have drank their red sauce in a glass, it was that good! The lasagna was probably the best I've ever had. This is not the type of place that you go to for a quick meal. They take their time and do things right. Our service was good and the food very very good! If you want an authentic Italian meal then this is place for you."}
{"text":"I highly recommend their eggplant roll ups. Their sauce is fantastic. Old World charm. If I had to find something negative to say, my only complaint would be that I wish the bread were homemade and warm. But everything else is fantastic.They have their own parking."}
{"text":"It saddens me that Guarino's is rated so low in comparison to Bella and Vita which are worse in my opinion. Family owned for an extremely long time and everything about the place screams it.  The interior design is very old, almost in need of a remodeling but adds to the old school feel. The staff looks to be comprised of family and friends and so can come off as blunt or rude but on point. The food is where Guarino really shines. You can tell that it is a family owned restaurant for generations because of the depth of flavors unseen in many of the other restaurants in Little Italy. Friend from out of town had nothing good to say about Cleveland other than that he had the best chicken of his life at Guarino's."}
{"text":"Had the brasiole, let me just say I've grown up in an italian family and my grandmother and mother made it all the time, theirs were so tender you cut it with a fork. This place has the toughest, chewiest meat ever, you have to saw through it with a knife then better hope you have strong teeth because it's really a tough chew, and to top it off it had no flavor. My wife had spaghetti and meatballs and she enjoyed those, I tried the meatballs and they were tender and tasty. It's probably a coin toss, place has been there awhile so go on a busy night if you're going to try it, the night we went there was only one other couple there. My brasiole was more than likely old and microwaved because it wasn't very hot either."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place, and was gravelly disappointed in the service and the poor management. The food was very good, but the trade-off was the incredibly poor service and the indifference of the management. Our waiter , Tony, had so many tables, so he was not attentive, and the manager was so busy sitting at the table with the 2 women next to us that he was oblivious to everything going on in his restaurant. He was the absolute worst manager I have ever seen in a restaurant. I will not go back, or recommend this place to any of my friends. Too bad, as the food was quite good."}
{"text":"I chose Guarino's based on the fact that it seemed old school and had a patio. I was very pleased with the food I ordered. The bruschetta had cooked tomatoes in it along with raw ones. It added a whole new depth of flavor that I haven't had in bruschetta before.    I recommend the house salad. I am pretty picky when it comes to Italian house salads since I'm not a fan of vinegar. The dressing was just right. I think it had parmesan in it. I'm glad I ordered it! For my entree, I ordered chicken piccata. I had never had this before. The chicken was prepared very well and I liked the overall flavor. The entrees took awhile to come out, but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"4 stars for the outside back patio, 2 stars for the food.  Their marinara sauce is very bland in my opinion.  Service was slow.  And very dated decor.  I'm tired of eating at mediocre joints in Little Italy.  Can't someone get a sauce right?  I still think the best place in Little Italy is Mia Bella across the street.  Although it's more of a Northern Italian menu, the quality at Mia Bella is definitely there.  And it seems the word is getting out because it's consistently crowded.   Mama Santa's is marginally better than Guarino's.  I'd skip Guarino's."}
{"text":"New to Cleveland, but this has already become a regular place for my family. Both indoor and outdoor seating, full bar. You can wear jeans. Sometimes they have live music on the patio (the standards). Love it."}
{"text":"It is very rare that I have a negative feeling about the service when I visit restaurants. However, during my 1 hour visit to the place, I had experienced the absolute worst attitude from our waitress Samantha. We paid the place a visit because everywhere else was full, while the restaurant was almost empty during dinner hour. The owner and the other waiters were attentive; they often stopped and asked you how you liked the food, or if you needed anything. (Which was acceptable in my opinion) Not Samantha though. She never returned to our table except for when she gave us the check. When we asked if it'd be possible to split the check, she gave us THE dirtiest look I've ever seen in the entire restaurant industry. The girl clearly should not be serving people because she obviously hates her job. She really doesn't deserve any tip at all, but I felt bad for the other waiters who were friendly. I sincerely advise anyone who would like to have a pleasant dining experience to please refrain from visiting the place."}
{"text":"Impeccable service and the eggplant rollup was delicious! The only thing better was the Christmas Ale ice cream. P.S. They also have their own small parking lot."}
{"text":"Cute and Kitschy italian joint. Handsome waiter, in charming Little Italy"}
{"text":"Guarino's has always been our favorite restaurant in Cleveland's Little Italy neighborhood. We arrived early for our reservation and enjoyed a cocktail at the bar. Later, we were seated for dinner on the patio, which was perfect for a warm Summer evening in July.   I recommend Guarino's  If you're looking for a nice restaurant with great ambiance in Little Italy. We'll be sure to visit again when we're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is kind of like eating at your grandma's house. It's not perfect with it's rickety chairs and holey tableclothes, but it's quaint and a little quirky.  Most important thing is that the food was absolutely delicious. We had a really nice server and great lasagne and manicotti. The italian dressing was awesome. I've craved it ever since I left."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in this restaurant the warning flags went up there was nobody in there to her three people outback the bread was ok not homemade it was like from the supermarket the wine was serving a small glasses eight dollars a class for half a cup of wine is expensive to me the food was not that great I've gotten better food  at the mall and my wife's Linguin was tasteless The chicken was tough don't plan on coming back"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, kind people! But a little bummed out my the food, to be honest. I grabbed dinner and drinks here with friends because we were looking for a pretty place to eat in Little Italy. Didn't disappoint in the slightest with the welcoming, cozy patio seating in the back.   Maybe I sound a little too snobby saying this, but something I love about Italian food is that delicious bread- amo il pane! But the bread was cold and kinda looked like classic sandwich bread and came with some with little prepacked butter which was a bummer. I also got one of their speciality pizzas, the Capri. And again I sound like a pompous jerk, but after having pizza in Capri and in various places around Italy, I was hoping for something a little bit closer to the namesake. Even by American standards not the best. (Did try a bite of pesto gnocchi and was pretty good! But again, not like amaze.)  However, I think this is a good place for old school Americanized Italian food in a nice place setting. The feel can't be beat."}
{"text":"Guarino's is one of my favorite restaurants down in Little Italy...the marinara sauce is one of the best I have ever had..the Alfredo sauce could have used more cheese and butter in it (was still good).. The wedding soup was delicious... And the veal was perfectly cooked and had great taste..the lasagna could have used a bit more ricotta cheese.. But that was my only complaint for that dish..great food, great atmosphere, great service, and even the owner goes around and talks to the tables..he pulled up a chair and sat and chatted with us..great place!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the neighborhood with my brother because we were going to show him around Lakeview Cemetery.  We were looking for a place for lunch and, it being Memorial Day, this was the only place open.  It didn't look too busy, but we were told it would take a few minutes to seat us.  The hostess gave us our menus and pointed us to our table and we sat ourselves.  Then we waited for about 20 minutes before someone came by to take our drink order (so, we ordered our food at the same time).    We were never given any water or any bread (even though other tables had some) and we were getting antsy, so we started to play the \"game\" where you pay attention to who was seated before you and when their orders were taken and who gets their food before you and we are losing this game.  I think we were coming in last place in this game.  Several tables are already getting food (though they are mostly getting appetizers) and we're still waiting and around the forty minute mark when we are still just sitting around with our iced teas and waters and no bread we start talking about how we should just leave $5 on the table for the iced teas and just split.  Our food finally comes after we were there for nearly an hour.  The $10 caesar salads my wife and brother got we nothing more than lettuce, pepperidge farm bread crumbs, dressing, and cheese and not enough for a stand alone meal, even for lunch (we kind of assumed they would be because they were only $2 less than some of the entrees and because they also offered a $7 version).  My brother's wedding soup never came.  We mentioned this to our waitress, but she didn't really bother to notice.  She was very inattentive and it wasn't because of the amount of tables she was waiting because she was often just \"farting-around\" near the bar.  We quickly ate and didn't want to wait around for another 20 minutes to get our check so we just threw enough money on the table to cover our bill and walked out."}
{"text":"First of all this restaurant is amazing from an architectural standpoint. It is over 100 years old. The food is amazing. If you think you know lasagna you should try theirs. It is amazing."}
{"text":"Very tasty Italian food. Plenty of food at reasonable prices. Quick, attentive service. Wonderful fall evening spent on the beautiful patio listening to enchanting live music."}
{"text":"The only redeeming part of the 1hr 20 min wait for my food was the tasty eggplant parmesan that eventually made its way to my table.   My party was 1 of 3 that was left in the entire restaurant and I still found the service to be poor. The waitress was unfamiliar with the menu and the restaurant ran out of the chicken parmesan sandwich and raspberry vinaigrette. When asked about a plate of mozzarella sticks that never arrived, the waitress told us that someone in the back was eating them, thinking it was a canceled order. Yikes.  I'm surprised that the service has not improved after so many complaints. Being the oldest Italian restaurant in Little Italy, it's a nice staple but the service (and interior decorating) has to change."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it.  It holds fond memories for me because my former husband and I went there a few times back in the day. But outside of the ambiance, I was severely disappointed with my recent visit.   I went on a Saturday night. It was nice they had their own parking lot with free valet parking.  HUGE plus in Little Italy. I was seated very quickly by a friendly hostess.  I chose to sit in the bar area at one of the nice small tables there since I was alone. There was a nice little band playing jazz music. That's when it all went bad.   First I had to ask the waiter to wipe my table with a wet towel. (The table was dirty when I sat down, which was no big deal as the other patrons had just left. It wasn't an issue the table was dirty, it was how he was trying to clean it up. Just odd) He had tried to clean it with a cocktail napkin. :/   But ok...no big deal.  He took my drink order and my food order and I went to the restroom.  The restroom was filthy!!!!!!  The toilet,sink and floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. I washed my hands and left.  I didn't even use the toilet.  Also, of note is that there is NO WAY this restroom was handicap compliant.  IDK if any part of this restaurant is.  A wheelchair would definitely not even get in the front door. I didn't go to the back of the restaurant so they may have other accommodations?    OK So I went back to my table and waited.  My drink came out quickly after my return.  It was a lovely house Chianti.  My salad came out next and the dressing was fabulous.  I really enjoyed this salad. Unfortunately, the bread brought with the salad was cold.  Like it was stored in a fridge. Also, the butter was frozen solid. I couldn't even spread it. Not sure what they were trying to accomplish with that.  In good time my main dish came out just as I finished up my salad.  I ordered the \"house specialty\", the lasagna. This was quite possibly the worst lasagna I have ever had in my life.  Firstly it was tepid.  Secondly the noodles were VERY al dente.  Too uncooked and tough for my preference. Third, it had big chunks of italian sausage in it.  No...just no. Also, the sauce was very bland and almost charred tasting.  So needless to say, I was quite disappointed in my dinner.  I did like the little band playing so I decided to order desert.  I got the tiramisu.  It was very good. My only complaint would be to lose the hersheys drizzle on top.   Overall, The place was hopping.  So maybe my experience was unusual. I'd say go there for the ambiance and for a mediocre meal.  But don't be disabled and don't use the restroom."}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat here so I can't comment on the atmosphere or food but I did try to reserve a party of 8 for three in the afternoon on Saturday and the woman on the phone told me this will not be possible and flat out told me to try back some other time. This woman was so rude to me that we decided to bring our business elsewhere. Thank you Guarino's for demonstrating your customer service skills before we even set foot in your restaurant:)"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and the place is very cute, but it is AWFUL service (I Have been a server for 5 years and my fiancé is a restaurant manager). Went there during lunch today- after waiting an exceptionally long time for our server to actually come over (with just three tables sat in the entire place), I ordered an eggplant Parmesan (on the lunch menu for $9).  Our server never asked me if I wanted the dinner portion or lunch portion (it was 1:00 on a Friday and the lunch menu was sitting right in front of us so I assumed she would have ordered the lunch size). She went ahead and ordered me the \"dinner\" size so when we got our bill we were charged $14. When I very nicely brought it up to her server assistant (who was very nice and seemed to be doing a much better job than our actual server), she apologiZed for the bill and said she would get it fixed.  Then our server came over and told us that there was a dinner size and a lunch size. I told her she never asked me which one I wanted and instead of just taking the $5 off the bill like any normal server would do when they mess up, she was trying to argue with us about it. We ended up paying for the dinner size, but We were absolutely appalled.  We are never picky about our service because we both work in the industry, but this girl was awful.  We have been there numerous times before and put up with the bad service, but this time tops it. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food was average, not a place to impress someone. Unique, old world decor.  Had scallop appetizer and house salad, dressing great. Spaghetti as entree, not bad but not impressed. Spumoni was adequate."}
{"text":"Our party of 6 was seated right away as dinner rush, if there was one, was over.  Restaurant setting was very nice, service was friendly.  We were served by Suzy, which was a real treat.  I had looked at menu online and seeing a few gluten free options but when we got there, 2 were not available.  They were very accommodating by grilling  eggplant and serving with GF pasta topped with marinara sauce. Our group seemed to be pleased with their spaghetti and meatballs, veal parm and tri color pasta.  Food, ok, service good, restaurant ambience nice too."}
{"text":"Old school Italian restaurant is the best way to describe Giordino's. This past Tuesday I came in for an early dinner with my girlfriend before going to the Indians game. The hostess greeted us with a smile and a welcoming voice. Our waitress gave us just the right amount of attention throughout our meal.   I ordered the lasagna while my girlfriend ordered the manicotti. Both dishes came out quickly and both dishes were done to perfection. The noodles in the lasagna were done just right and the sauce was really flavorful.  The dining room gives you that old school Italian feel that fits in perfect in the middle of Cleveland's little Italy neighborhood. It is also very clean in the dining room.   This was the first time I have eaten here and I will be back again."}
{"text":"Mantenere quel fascino senza fiato Perché ti amo Proprio il modo di cucinare stasera"}
{"text":"Awful all around!!! From the food to the decor, this restaurant was a huge disappointment. This restaurant is where lace, bows, and your grandmother's floral wall paper goes to die. I should have turned around immediately after walking in the door. The restaurant was completely empty & silent. The owner did offer to turn the music back on for me.   The menu was super basic and limited in offerings. I ordered Cannelloni which came with a house salad & bread. The salad is a mix of romaine lettuce and sliced dull looking carrots. The bread was mildly stale. The Cannelloni was essentially a big noodle with a meatball with unchopped chunks of garlic cloves stuffed inside. A big disappoint as I'm not a huge fan of meatball and don't enjoy unexpectedly biting into entire cloves of garlic.   Skip this restaurant when venturing out to Little Italy!!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a while. Probably won't be back. We ordered the gamberi Al guarino. The shrimp tasted old, chewy. The prosciutto was not cooked enough. The house salad was delicious. Great dressing. The brasciole and veal saltimbocca we're fantastic! But VincenO and Sam would turn in there graves at the cannoli. Not made there or purchased at nearby bakery. From a supplier. They were small and over cooked. The service was sub-pare."}
{"text":"Guarinos is a wonderful place to sit and eat delicious food. The staff makes you feel like family."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my kids and while the service was great, my daughter's chicken in her Alfredo was bland and my chicken marsala had a sweet taste to the sauce and the chicken was slightly over cooked. I have ordered take out from here before and I liked the food, so I am willing to say the restaurant might of had an \"off night."}
{"text":"While I agree with most reviews posted here, I have to give this place five stars for the simple fact that this is the oldest Italian establishment in Ohio. That is right - the first Italian restaurant in OHIO. That's just cool in my book and a historic place to dine in regardless of all the much-room-for-improvement that Little Italy has become..."}
{"text":"Really not a very good Italian restaurant. I usually measure on the sauce. This was watery and sweet. Nice try but no thank you"}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of little Italy primarily because I can get decent Italian food closer to home.  However my parents wanted to go and we had a holiday meal there.  The place is decorated a little odd (Victorian in the back end, wood paneled basement style in the middle, and a pub up front) but I liked the kitchyness of it all.   Our server, Miss Suzie, has been there for 46 years (really!) and knew her stuff.  As you could imagine she's not the fastest moving server but made up for it in smiles.  We had some red wine to start, the house cab.  Not bad, have no idea what it was.  They didn't really have a kids' menu so we had to order adult portions and split it.  They brought out the adult meals and plates to split it.  I had hoped that they would have done that in the kitchen, as our tables were not bussed as quickly as we'd have hoped and the plates piled up fast.  Kids all had spag/meatballs and no complaints.  Pricey though.  I had some Italian Wedding soup.  The versions I have all had were orzo pasta, meatballs, spinach (or endive) and broth of some sort.  What I got was chicken and stars soup.  One small meatball.  I asked the server \"Is this wedding soup?  Wheres the greens?\" She replied \"I think they ran out, or maybe they make it that way here.  That's not how I do it at home\"...I'd much rather have Miss Suzie's soup b/c the wedding soup at Guarinos was not very good at all.    I had Chic Parm -- It was good, small portion of pasta (probably a good thing for me) but not $16/plate good.  The price points were high; the dish prob would be a little more in the range of $12-$14.  Sauce was a little sweet but not watery.  When my wife ordered a second glass of wine; the server brought the new glass, picked up the old glass, and poured it into the new one...odd.   The manager visited our table, and even gave the kids free ice cream.   Nice touch.  Overall we'd go back if we were in the neighborhood but not really a destination place for me based on price/value."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I had the- 50 year old recipe- lasagna and it was delish! The ricotta inside tasted so fresh and the sausage was perfect amount of spice. My son had the chicken parmigiana and it was cooked to perfection with homemade noodles. We ordered salads as well and Italian bread and butter was brought to the table. The bread could have been warm, the butter could have been whipped in a dish rather than tinfoil wrapped pats. But the main dishes made up for that. The waiter was very attentive as well as the hostess...which made up for not having a table ready for our reservation. It was a busy night and the staff was working hard. Overall, I would definitely cone back again and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite restaurant. Veal Parmesan is the best in the city. Lasagna is amazing as well. Service is excellent.  They reallystrive to create a friendly welcome experience. Prices are reasonable for what you get. Outside patio is beautiful. Bonus: the this is a historic restaurant & they have parking."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner on Sunday with family on the beautiful patio. Negroni cocktail was spot on - maybe the best in Little Italy. Main courses were average but good, and the side salads which are a $4 upgrade were better than average. Service was without event."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance and superb wait staff. I eat gluten free and our waitress was incredibly patient and accommodating when I asked about menu options for me. She made a great recommendation and went out of her way to bring me a gluten free roll before dinner too. I gave 3 stars for the food. The food was slightly above average. The fourth star I added because of the employees. I will definitely go back because of the staff and the great ambiance."}
{"text":"Isaiah K wrote a very good review on Yelp. He points out the depth of flavors that is, IMO, a good observation.       The restaurant has a wonderful storied past that goes back to 1918 when Guarino's started out as a bar and pool hall. Vincenzo Guarino met Mary Lomparo and eventually married and together transformed the bar into a full service Sicilian restaurant replete with trumpet vines in the rear patio garden. Their son Sam and his wife Marilyn were responsible for decorating the restaurant in the Victorian style later on in 1963 that characterizes the restaurant today. Family friend Nancy Phillips owns and operates the restaurant today with her children Scott and Rachel.       The calamari is the star appetizer on the menu which comes with their sweet red marinara sauce, a must have staple item to try. Many of the dishes are old world inspired such as the lasagna and penne. They feature special items daily like the Chicken Pacifico  which was superb. The list of wines is not extensive but the prices are very reasonable. The tiramisu is old world inspired as emphasized by the cake and not the creme or espresso. They also feature their signature wedding soup which was very fresh and delicious.       We actually had an awkward experience recently there. Most recently around New Years Day 2016, their we asked their night bartender if he could make a Gypsy kiss. He had never heard of it and didn't have all the ingredients but created an improvised version of it and renamed it the New Orleans kiss, with B and B in it. Not bad. He then made sizeable batches of it and began sharing it with the guests that very evening. So that was a bit odd. :/      On Saturdays, there is a piano player and vocalist that does forties era jazz vocal standards.       Parking is free! Guarino's is a must stop in Little Italy."}
{"text":"We wanted a spot with parking, and picked Guarinos simply for that. I couldn't be happier with our selection. When we walked around the corner from the front door we KNEW we were in Little Italy. It was throw-back perfection with a decent sized bar and a very large seating area. The inside seating had a lot going on, I'm all about nostalgia and this was it. We asked to be seated outside and were taken back to a multi-level garden with lots  of seating. The garden even had touches of decor, statues, bird cages, twinkle lights in the trees. I was surprised how many seats were in the entire restaurant, inside and out.   We started with the bruschetta, a smaller portion with the toast rounds perfectly buttered and the topping seasoned just right. It was a good size for us to share, but if you are super hungry you may want your own.   One friend ordered the seafood pasta (the name escapes me). It was a large portion with a good cream sauce and mix of seafood, but we all agreed the crab was not real. A slight disappointment, but a solid dish otherwise. The other ordered the eggplant parmigiana, a beautiful dish that she enjoyed very much. As I had a large lunch I had a capresi salad,perfectly simple and exactly what I hoped for. The two dinners were so large, there was plenty left over to take home for lunch.   We ended with the cannoli. Two small and expertly crafted pieces, we all agreed they were quite good. If you like cannoli, don't share this dessert.   Finally, the staff. We never felt rushed nor unloved, even though we arrived early and had a planned leisurely dinner they didn't miss a beat. Suzie is clearly a staple, ask for her and you'll not be disappointed. The rest of the staff was also attentive, even bringing us a cushion when one found the metal outdoor chairs a bit uncomfortable. The owner - or maybe he was the manager - checked on us, we saw him offer some TLC to a large family table nearby, then he even helped us out a side door. Finally, we were escorted to our car by the friendly parking lot attendant. You have to love folks who care about their patrons, next time I'm in Cleveland I'll surely come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Little Italy. The owner is very friendly and the staff makes you feel like you're part of the family. High-quality food. Recommend that tricolor pasta, the veal Saltinboca, and quite frankly, you cannot go wrong with anything. Check it out and let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's fair to review Guarino's as my tiny sampling was during the Feast of the Assumption and I just wasn't impressed.  I picked up my cavatelli and meatball from a street vendor and marched my way down the street with much anticipation.  The meatball was good. Nice flavor.  The sauce was bland.  I wanted more! More flavor, more something.  I'll definitely have to give this place another shot next time I visit!  Even if the food wasn't my favorite, the history is remarkable.  This is the oldest restaurant in Cleveland and has a history of entertaining mobsters. Guarino's has played host to Joe Torre and Dean Martin and, of course, don't forget the wise guys. \"Jack White, the last of the big-time mobsters, used to love to sit in the garden in the back and drink our homemade wine,\" says Phillips, referring to the nickname for racketeer James Licavoli. \"He thought it was really peaceful back there.\"  In the '70s, Licavoli was known as \"King of the Hill,\" as in Murray Hill. He isn't the only mobster who tried to lay claim to the area over the decades.  There was also Moe Dalitz, the Cleveland racketeer who would go on to build up Las Vegas in the 1940s. And, don't fuhgettabout the Mayfield Road Mob, which rose to prominence during Prohibition.  \"Guarino's used to serve two kinds of coffee cups during Prohibition,\" says Phillips, who is half Sicilian and half Irish. \"One for coffee and the other for wine - a lot of places did that back then.\"  The Mayfield Road Mob also paved the way for Martin's singing career, landing him gigs in joints it controlled, according to Nick Tosches' book \"Dino.\""}
{"text":"Guarino's is a beautiful restaurant that serves delicious food. They have this beautiful backyard patio with outdoor seating which looks like something right out of a movie. Definitely check this place out (and disregard any lower ratings)!!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent old time italian. Kitchy dated decor. Real nice server and a nice bottle of Chianti.  Cool neighborhood patio looks cool when it gets warm. Apps were amazing including the calamari.  Pizza was ok but not memorable.  The other guys food looked great."}
{"text":"Where to start. First of all I'm an Italian American that grew up in Chicago, so I have high expectations. I am new to the Cleveland area so I decided to try the little italy area. I was so excited to goto little Italy. I chose this restaurant because I found parking next to it. As soon as I sat at my table I can say the service was horrible. The nonna that took my order just hated life and everyone in it. I order mussels as an appetizer it was good. I then ordered the fruti di mare as my main plate. This dish is the real test for any Italian restaurant, all I can say it is the worst I ever had and I have travelled the world many times and this was the worst fruti di mare I ever had. The fish was all chopped into small pieces which made it obvious it came out of a can. Really fish in a can! In little Italy! Then the aglio & olio sauce was load with butter. Btw, real Italian dishes do not use much butter. Bad fish in can and a butter sauce. Don't go here."}
{"text":"I went here about a month ago and was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful the meal was.  We've eaten here before, and it's always been good, but this particular visit was one of the best Italian meals I've ever had.  First of all, we normally sit inside, which has the classic vintage Italian grandmother's house feel to it (but don't worry, noone there slapped my hand with a wooden spoon.)  The inside is always nice and cozy, but their patio in the back is absolutely beautiful.  We had a fairly large group and they seated us with no problem.  The meal starts out with good bread, and plentiful wine (if your family is anything like my husband's.)  Our orders were taken, and there was apparently an issue with the ticket printer in their kitchen so the orders were delayed.  One of the owners of the restaurant actually took the time to come around to each table and apologize for the delay.  My mother-in-law joked that another bottle of wine would make us all feel better, so the owner sent us a bottle of wine on the house-such a nice gesture that showed they really do care about the customer.  When the food came out, it was absolutely delicious.  I got veal parmesan and it was so well-prepared.  My husband got the veal saltimbocca, which was also delicious.  In fact, everyone at my table thoroughly enjoyed their meal.   Overall we left there having spent a very relaxing evening, feeling stuffed, and smiling.  What more could you ask for?  I would highly recommend trying this place if you are heading to Little Italy."}
{"text":"My Manicotti was DELICIOUS!!!!! Their red sauce is perfection, I would definitely get it again!!!   Their house salad was simple and tasty...  The main reason I am giving it a two is the Fettuccine Alfredo... The sauce between blande bites had something bitter in it. We asked the waistress and she suggested maybe *basil because she saw a lot of green.* It was not basil... she did offer to get another dish but we were in a hurry so my partner just asked for some marinara to drown out the bitter and that took care of it.   We felt it was rather pricey too, especially for lunch.  Also, cold bread and butter? c'mon ;)  Staff was very nice though!!!"}
{"text":"Yuck! I've been there only once. The decor is absolutely horrifying. Laces, porcelain dolls and ribbons covered the walls and windows! The restroom is not any better. The whole restaurant was dark and gloomy. No it's SO not romantic. I don't care if it's the first Italian restaurant opened in Ohio, you'd think they had more time to figure out how to run a business.   The waitress was a late middle age woman who was very rude to us. We tried to order two different bottles of wine and apparently they were ALL OUT. Come on! It's a Friday night. The menu selection was very small, so I decided to go with what seemed to be a fool-proof dish: The trio pasta.    When our food came out, it was already cold. The pasta was not cooked through. The pesto tasted like pure olive oil. I can cook WAYYY better pasta than this to pay $20 some dollar for this soggy plate of stuff.  Will NOT go back"}
{"text":"Suggest that this restruant needs help.  Of our party of five, three has ok food. The veal dishes were disappointing and pasta served was al dente.. the valets were super and the piano player was superior.    No spumoni was provided. How can this the oldest Italian restruant and not serve a spumoni or gelato?  Staff was fine."}
{"text":"Guarino's is a family legacy and food delicacy not matter what you order.  This is old school Italian dining with the owner stopping by and saying hi to everyone and checkin to make sure the food is to par.  If not he will make it right but no need for that!  The chicken picatta is the best i've ever had.  It was also GF which was awesome because so many dishes are made with flour for thickening.  The wine I had was a montepulciano that paired nicely before and with the meal.  The food is incredibly fresh.  The waitress attentive and the outdoor dining on the porch awesome.  Could not have been a better meal!  If you so tell the owner you appreciate his care for the community and keeping his restaurant in the family through the generations!  Great place to stop before opera or a date or night on the town!"}
{"text":"Food is good service has gone down hill over the years. I have been eating here for over 20 years the food is still very good but the service is average at best. The bar is below average."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I ate at this restaurant, although we have received deliveries from them and have always been pleased.  The decor is, in a word, old.  I know it is an old restaurant, but it could use some updating.  The servers generally reflect this as well.  We ordered the calimari as an appetizer and it was excellent.  The past dishes are generous sized, and good value for the price.  Service was timely and attentive.  I would continue to order delivery food from them, but don't know that I would hurry back to dine there."}
{"text":"Guarino's is hands down the most romantic, most authentic Italian restaurant in cleveland.  I was shocked reading the other reviews. My husband and I  go at least once a month to get our fix! We're always greeted immediately, usually the hostess accompanied by the owner. The owner usually doesn't remember us but we cut him slack considering he's kept the traditions of Guarino's alive! We almost went to Mia Bella tonight but one glance at the new, hipster-like vibe it has going on,  we decided we couldn't cheat on our classic date night.   Although I'm skeptical of letting out my secret... as a 3 glass per meal- white wine lover, it's a bit hard buying an entire bottle instead of by the glass but no worries.  One small word to the owner and our problem solved.   The food is fantastic. We generally eat an entire loaf of this so-called \"stale\" bread...... tastes pretty good to me! Especially with the serve-yourself Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.   We've been treated nothing short of family every single time we eat here. Many of the reviews I've read have something negative to say about the servers.... if you enjoy fake smiles, laughs and smalltalk- go somewhere else. These servers are genuine. Just how we like em! :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely an old school italian restaurant with a great vibe and amazing staff inside.  We like to come here around Christmas time when everything is decorated so beautifully.   I only gave it three stars because I wish they would have more pasta options and sauces like vodka sauce as marinara is too heavy for me.   We started off with the complimentary bread and butter and then added the garlic and cheese bread to start off with. We tried a variety of dishes such as the angel hair marinara, cheese ravioli, frutti di mare, and lasagna. All very delicious.  The tiramisu was fantastic and is served in an adorable looking glass. If you're in Little Italy highly recommend to stop here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Cleveland.  Great family oriented place.  We come here a lot for birthdays.  The house dressing on the salads is by far the best I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Well I disagree with most of the reviews for Guarinos, because I still think you guys should give it a try if you are looking for truly authentic Italian food. Lasagna and cannelloni are both excellent, and for $14 you do leave pretty full. I went here for Valentine's day and I couldn't have been happier with their adorable setup and specials going on, some may call it tacky, but I call it homey... I first found out about Guarinos on a school field trip, ironically enough the owner said how romantic it would be to come with your date sometime, so I did a few months later and it definitely lived up to my expectations. I'm not giving five stars because my first experience with the manicotti was not the best, quite small in my opinion. But yesterday made up for it.  Again, as mentioned, I really appreciate the history along with this restaurant too. Being the oldest restaurant and family owned business in Cleveland is pretty cool. So guys, andare a mangiare!"}
{"text":"Pretty ok. Loved the atmosphere. And I had the place to myself for most of my meal, which was just what I needed at the end of a long day. The service was good, relaxed without dragging. The food was nothing to write home about. Bread was good.  I had a half Caesar salad, which I found to be a little goopy with the dressing. Good flavor though.   The entree was so-so chicken piccata. It wasn't bad it was just kind of bland. More lemon I think would have improved it substantially, and maybe a little more butter in the pan frying process. The wine was pretty good, I mean I've had better but not bad. Overall it was pleasant."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant located in the Little Italy part of Cleveland. Food is good and live music is a nice touch that makes out a lovely atmosphere. Service is excellent though a little bit oppressive"}
{"text":"Food was fine I guess. The weird thing was that our server brought us a wine list written in sharpie.  Across the top it sad \"$8 per glass, $30 per bottle.  When we chose a wine, she said okay but that one is $32.  Uh...okay...."}
{"text":"Service was lovely, but food was absolute utter rubbish. Chicken parm and veal tasted as if straight from the freezer, garlic scooped out of a jar and parmesean straight out of a can. Two apps, two entrees and two drinks with tip was $70. Gutted. Should've  went next door to Mama Santa's and would've paid half (but probably not treated as nicely)."}
{"text":"Chicken piccata was decent, but nothing outstanding. The cavatelli it was served with was pretty bland. Bread seemed to be of the store bought variety. Many other places in the neighborhood to try over this one."}
{"text":"OK, I may be spoiled with so many outstanding Italian restaurants in the North End in Boston!  Wife and I split a Bruchetta that was served as a cup of chopped tomatoes with garlic and a plate of very thinly sliced Italian bread, eh? The Capresi was not memorable and the Veal Saltimbocca was good but not exceptional.  Prices were very reasonable but I would have paid more for a better meal.  Walking in @ 7:30 on a Friday nite and getting a table should have been a hint there were better places in the area."}
{"text":"We had a small group here to celebrate our engagement and could not have been happier! Great service and food. They were so accommodating and even gave us a bottle of champagne to celebrate. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice Cleveland landmark, wonderful staff, great bartender, outside patio is beautiful. Even has its own parking lot. Favorite dishes include calamari appetizer, antipasto appetizer, lasagna main course,       gnocchi is delicious as is a host of traditional favorites. Wine selection to satisfy all tastes and wonderful desserts."}
{"text":"First time and came in late on a Saturday.  No trouble at all being served. Top notch service and interaction from remaining staff.  We had Eggplant Parm, Brasciole, and Cannoli.  Loved the marinara on both entrees and had a great experience overall.  Picked up before we left as up to 9 more diners came in to smiling faces and a surely great experience.  One of the best in Little Italy since 1918.  Expect a 5 star check in soon."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 pasta dishes and a pizza. The pasta dishes were good to very good.  As for the pizza...I give it a '0'. Very disappointed that an Italian Restaurant would use American Pepperoni instead of the traditional \"old world' Style REAL pepperoni. And overall, it just wasn't good.  The staff was very friendly and service was great. And we enjoyed the ambiance.  So overall, it was OK."}
{"text":"Guarino's has poor food and poor cleanliness. The parmesan cheese on the tables isn't changed out, they just put new stuff on top. I have a friend that worked there and confirmed this. I stopped going after 2 tries, even though I lived practically next door to it. I would recommend any other restaurant in Little Italy over Guarino's. I gave it 2 stars because the atmosphere and service were good even though the food was bad."}
{"text":"Upping this one star because the eggplant Parmesan was the best I've had in this time zone"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for one reason - they have a parking lot. It was 2pm on a week day and we had done some sightseeing around Cleveland. We wanted to eat somewhere in Little Italy but could hardly find a descent parking spot. This place has a LOT! woo hoo!  Upon entering, the place is a time warp. Not sure what time period you're brought back to but it is another time. There were many empty tables (it was 2pm on a week day) but there were a few other patrons. We ate inside but it looked like there was a lovely patio for dining outside.   The staff was friendly, the food was fine. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Wedding soup was good, and so was antipasto.   Bread was good to.     The main dishes were disappointing.   Perhaps there is a can opener in the kitchen that needs to be confiscated.     Found the table service to be mechanical, not personable.     The atmosphere was unique and pleasant."}
{"text":"Disappointed after recalling eating a delicious romantic meal here over 10 years ago.  The food quality is definitely not the same!  The calamari was poorly seasoned with a boring breading and very overcooked and chewy.  The lasagna was cold.  The veal saltimbocca looked cheap with a thick boring breading and poor quality prosciutto.  It was topped with a bland almost-chicken-broth-from-a-can-with-flour sauce with some plain noodles.  The prices should have been much lower for the poor food quality.  Also, we sat around to enjoy our wine, paid our bill, but the waitress took our bill even while we were still sitting there, as if to seem to rush us off.  I've never seen a waitress take the bill before a guest has left.  I was highly disappointed.  I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Cleveland my friends and I came here on the recommendation of our Uber driver. It is now my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Not because it's the fanciest or the trendiest, but because they serve solid food and the atmosphere feels like home.   The staff is always friendly and it's always the same faces which goes a long way. I usually go with the veal parmesan or the gnocchi and always finish dinner off with a crema di limoncello.  Also, do not come here expecting a quick dinner. Have a few drinks, talk with your friends and family, and enjoy the night. It's nice to go to a place where you don't feel rushed so take it in and enjoy."}
{"text":"Agree with the other reviewers, this place deserves a negative rating. Awful decor, tiny portions of average/awful food, crappy overpriced wine and terrible service. That coupled with having to wait 10 minutes for valet when i was standing 50 feet from my car. Won't be returning or ever referring anyone to this place. The 5 star rating folks are confused or related. Worst restaurant experience I have ever had! Ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night. Of the 2 appetizers we had, the calamari wasnt as fresh as i would of liked for little italy but was good. The meat and cheese plate was great..  For meals, we had the chicken parm, eggplant parm and mussels. The mussels plate was again a bit small but had great flavor. The parm dishes were great. The marinara sauce had great taste. Service was great as they were slow so we had 3 people continuously checking on us through out the night. although in the beginning we were seated about 10 minutes before 3 other tables and we all got our bread at the same time.   Food 3 stars Service 3 stars Price 4 stars out of 5"}
{"text":"I'm still here but I wish my wife wouldn't asked me to stop. The entrance has this deep antique store stinch, as soon as we open the rolled silverware,  my wife finds a filthy knife and in that moment I decided to just ask for 1 drink and an appetizer in order to get my check. Won't be back foo shoo."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong at Guarinos! This place reminds me of an old Italian Sunday family dinner, with authentic decor!! Everything on the menu is old classic recipes that taste home made. The chicken parm and eggplant roll ups are the tops. It's such a nice classy place, we even had our rehearsal dinner here for our wedding! The owners take care of you from the minute you step in! A must go in little Italy!"}
{"text":"I would love to rate them higher but the service just didn't cut it. We waited 10 minutes to be greeted, 10 minutes for drinks, and 30 minutes for food. unfortunately it seemed like there were only two servers working and both were weeded the entire time. of course that's out of their control, but better service would have made our experience so much more enjoyable!   Food was all delicious, the veal Parmesan and manicotti were my favorites. Avoid the past primavera, it was nothing but dried out pasta with steamed veggies and a small amount of marinara. not worth ordering, there are many other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Smooth wines, sweet, stiff cocktails, and soft pasta make for a splendid Saturday dinner.  Guarino's falls between dressy and casual.  Sit up front to partake in the music."}
{"text":"The food and the ambiance remind me a lot of family Sunday dinners and favorite restaurants of old-school Italians.  The decor is a mish-mash of lacy things, old furniture, dim lighting.  I appreciate it for what it is and the nostalgia.  The server was excellent with the demeanor of an Italian nonna...all business with an underlying humor.  The manicotti was plump, smooth and delicious.  The food was somewhere between hot and warm, which is perfect in my opinion.  It was chilly and rainy so we didn't get to enjoy the patio.  It was pretty empty at about 5pm on a Saturday when we arrived,but was packed by the time we left.  Overall, a good experience if you're not a decor snob and want a solid meal like you'd find from an Italian grandma's kitchen."}
{"text":"- Last time I was there I ate outside with a friend on a summer day. It wasn't perfect, but the staff was friendly, ESPECIALLY management and the food was good for a more than far price. Nice atmosphere for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic venue for a relaxing and beautiful outdoor, family repast. Love the tasteful, eclectic and amazingly festive decor."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little place in little Italy. It's like stepping back in time the wall paper and the paneling make this a great atmosphere. We've been here many times. Why you ask? Well the food is always delicious and consistent the service is always wonderful. You can't go wrong at Guarino's. Normally I get the eggplant Rollup's but this time I decided to try something new. I had the chicken piccata and it didn't disappoint it was wonderful. Everyone enjoyed their meals and we had a wonderful evening. I highly recommend this place as a top stop for Little Italy."}
{"text":"The food was heavy.  Chicken Marsala was a large chicken breast that was deep fried, with a very dark gummy sauce."}
{"text":"We didn't feel welcome starting from the parking lot. I understand they want to make sure no one is parking in their lot but instead of sounding accusatory, as if we're going to park there and go somewhere else, why didn't they say \"welcome to Guarino's!\" ? There were SO many parking spaces all along the road. It was 11:30am. Why would you assume we're going somewhere else? Give us a break. My biggest problem with Guarino's: the OUTRAGEOUS prices. I do not mind paying twice what they charge but show me something for it. $14 for 13 tiny shriveled mussels. $12 for an aweful tasting steak salad. Mediocre at best alfredo pasta.  I felt so ripped off when I left. It's not my style to raise hell when I'm not happy. I just won't come back. And I wanted to help out anyone else that was considering going there. Try another place. I was so unhappy with what I paid. I wanted to treat my mom but I could have done a lot better somewhere else."}
{"text":"Overall the meal was good. The atmosphere is nice but needs a little cleaning. I ordered the lasagna and it was a very healthy portion but the center was cool. The flavor was very good and layered well. The bread was fresh but a little disappointed it did not automatically come with olive oil and vinegar but I had to ask. I'm spoiled by other authentic Italian spots that do the traditional stuff. Nice place and I will come again. My daughter loved her spaghetti !!!!"}
{"text":"The stuffed peppers were perfect! The garlic cheese bread was crunchy and the sauce was fresh and light. Very romantic for our 11 yr anniversary."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a friend and it was so good! We were glad we got reservations because this place was extremely busy. There is free valet parking outside which was very nice given the lack of street parking. All the staff were very friendly and attentive, and the owner came by to all the tables at least twice to welcome us to the restaurant and make sure we didn't need anything. The food was excellent and came out pretty quickly. Lastly, when we got our car at the end, the parking attendant went out of his way to ensure we could make the left turn back onto Mayfield road. Overall, from start to finish we had an amazingly pleasant experience. Would definitely recommend this historical landmark to all."}
{"text":"Grew up in Cleveland and finally thought I'd try this place when I was in town visiting my parents. I love Little Italy and miss old Sheldon at the Mayfield Theatre!    Going inside you definitely get this old world feeling. Kinda fun.  No booths, all tables. Ordered the calamari, and it was old school, simple and excellent. Fried at the perfect temperature with no other funny flavors from using the oil for other things. It was lightly battered served with a typical marinara sauce. Advice: a simple squeeze of lemon and a dash of salt is all you need.   Got worse from there. I ordered the eggplant parm.  Who'd imagine an old time institution couldn't get this right?  It was slightly bitter which means it wasn't salted and pressed enough, and the pasta was washed with water so the gravy doesn't cling to the noodles.  The marinara was nothing special. the prosciutto wrapped scallops seemed like an excellent idea.  They were serve cold, and had a funny taste to them. The server was kind enough to take them off the bill.  It's a great idea, what the hell happened?    Sadly, the service was abysmal and frustrating. It was so bad it was comical.  Frankly, our server was really, really a lovely person.  Sincerely, a very warm, kind woman, but the poor thing just didn't know how to serve a meal. When asking for small plates for the appetizers she was kind and cheerful, but came back with a stack of plates and placed them right in front of me and didn't distribute them.  When the appetizers came, they didn't even make room in the middle of the table.  I mean, geez!  It was at first frustrating, then absolutely comical, but eventually got frustrating.  Old institution like Guarino's On Murray Hill In Little Italy Who'd-a-thunk?  Big ole F. Were they like this when Bishop Pilla was Ordinary of Cleveland?"}
{"text":"I love Guarino's for the wonderful food, good service & old world Italian atmosphere. They pour a good drink & the patio is lovely. It's difficult to name just 1 dish as everything is delicious. But my husband loves the Veal Scallopini. I always get something different with one of their sauces."}
{"text":"Over 500 years ago, some guy landed in the new world. We won't say who or where since people get all crazy over it. Let's just say he was Italian and he was on a boat, b*tch. Went to celebrate the day in Little Italy, home to an even more debauched and chaotic bar crawl by some unnamed yelpers around five years ago. Best crawl I've ever been on, best Yelp thing I've ever been part of. My gals and I were going to get some pizza and eat it at the park across from Holy Rosary. Didn't really have a particular place picked out other than NOT Mama Santa's. The pie is notoriously bad there. We walked up and down the hill as memories of that epic crawl came back to me. Primo Vino, the epicenter of said crawl is not really a food place, more of a liquor place. Trattoria hasn't made decent food since my uncle was head chef back in the 90's. That left Guarino's as an option. Having never been, I voted here.   They ordered the food and I settled in at the bar for a cocktail. Amazing ambiance. Rivals Primo Vino in that regard. Had a Cointreau sidecar and a few complimentary shots of various liqueurs. Bar staff was top notch. Very nice to converse and pass a Sunday afternoon with. As time slipped by my drunken ass, the food beckoned. We ended up with two ten dollar small pies and a ten dollar salad. Hefty bill for not that much grub. Whatever. The experience and visit to the old neighborhood was worth it. And the Browns won! Holy Rosary!! I would love to come back and dine in, maybe try the patio. This is the kind of place that is disappearing in America. Genuine, no pretenses, historic and elegant. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu/ get sloshed here. And as for that crawl five years ago...to the other people in my party it might not have been that memorable. But to me, it will be a high water mark of night life and yelp life for the rest of my days. You had to be there. Back when yelp was cool."}
{"text":"Feels like I am back in Milan having a dinner with my husband. They have the parking, great food and pleasant service."}
{"text":"Had a little bit of time after a downtown appointment and since my wife was along with me, we thought a fine sunny day would be perfect for outside dining on \"The Hill\"! So to Murray Hill we ventured. Since it was Monday afternoon we were not sure what was opened and we decided first one seen, first one in.  In all the years we have visited the area, this was our first time at Guarino's and we were very surprised! First they did have the patio opened and we were seated in a spot with plenty of sun (to my wife's delight!)  Checked menu and saw a  lunch menu w/specials.  I had a taste of a meatball sub. My wife had the eggplant pasta.  After getting our beverages and our slices of Italian bread, the server came around a couple of times and said the plates would be up soon. Was a bit surprises she came around, since the place was only accommodating three tables, so that took a little off the \"star rating\".  But when the plates DID arrive, both were hot and that cannot be said many times for places with patios.  My sub was drenched in a very tasty, sweet sauce that topped the peppers and onions, with heated melted mozzarella cheese. Bun was warm and soft! IMO, perfect!  The eggplant plate had to be fantastic, since my wife did the unthinkable....cleaned her plate COMPLETELY! Either she was starving, or it was great.  Take it from her, it was the latter!!  All and all, a great spot for patio eating and on a day that did not start with this dining event in mind, was greatly enjoyable!  Highly recommend it if you are in the area!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was good- very 60s Italian. I had the gnocchi pesto. Beyond bland. Didn't taste basil. Didn't taste olive oil. Didn't taste Parmesan. Not sure how that's possible. The pine nuts were just sprinkled on top which seemed lazy. Salad was brown. House Italian tasted like stale parm. Portions were lame for the price (usually you can count on a $14 gnocchi to be pretty hearty - this one would be a 'small plate' at most other Italian joints). A very unimpressive $60 meal for the two of us. I'll be returning in the summer to check out \"the most romantic patio in Cleveland,\" hoping another dish will be worth it."}
{"text":"Service within any reasonable timeframe is apparently not on the menu at this institution.  Apparently the owners are not around on Memorial Day weekend.  The food was good but it took so long to even place an order that hunger and annoyance had completely taken over.  Drinks were not replenished and it took 30 minutes to order.  Our server clearly had better things to do.  If you are hungry (which you are when you go out to eat) you should consider someplace else."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a staple in Little Italy and worth at least one visit. Not good enough to make it \"that special place\" which you go to again and again.  There was a Mrs. Guarino in my wife's family and she could teach them a thing or two about classic food!  The menu is average and I found the dining room to be dark, poorly decorated and loud. Our waitress was not familiar with the menu and our meal was just average. Once again, the location is great since you can walk around the neighborhood before and after dinner to visit one of the many galleries or shops.  3 stars for the restaurant - add another for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We intended on going to Mamma Santas after a day at the art museum on Sunday. But we found out from a nice oldster sitting on a bench near by that \"thaya antta openia on the Sundays\". So we ended up at Guarinos.   We sat inside b/c a wedding was on the back patio. The decor inside is frightening. And the food mirrored that as well. Goopy, outta the jar, no love from Nonna style food. Hard rolls, pathetic house salad, and the worst marinara sauce. I really have had more \"authentic\" at the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"This place makes you feel right at home! We did not have a reservation but the owner found us a table in the beautiful terrace in the back. Our server, Anthony, was attentive and professional. The ambiance was on point - classy yet casual. The bruschetta was fresh, a light and authentic starter and the entree, Frutti Di Mare , was light yet filling. We topped off the night with a dessert cocktail called Sleep When You're Dead. It was recommended by our server and exceeded our expectations! This restaurant has a family feel and Italian charm. Highly recommend for anyone!"}
{"text":"So I came here as my Birthday dinner it's defidently needing a update the celing has damage and it's covered with doilies it felt stuffy so we opted to go outside our service was kinda ok, Sam I think her name , she had a slight attitude, the apps were very good garlic cheese and brushetta but my entree was disappointing chicken piccata  16$  it lacked lemon flavor and the noodles were off  my brothers lasagna was not great it was like a bowl of pasta sauce with not any lasagna noodles layered, the waitress brought out me a diff dish chicken parm but it was like  skinny piece of chicken hard as a rock and tasted cooked in old oil taste, also slathered all over with sauce, why? one bite and I just was done, the ice cream was good tho ,they gave me. I was still charged for everything they coulda took my piccata off since I didn't eat it at all . The owner is very nice I just wish my dinner was a little better :-\"}
{"text":"We wet for dinner on Sunday.  I ordered the strip steak and my husband ordered wedding soup and pizza.  Good, traditional Italian.  Bread was served with whipped butter and tomatoes on the side (bruschetta style).  AWESOME strip steak, perfectly prepared and seasoned!  For a simple cut of steak, it was delicious!!  Service was great!"}
