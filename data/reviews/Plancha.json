{"text":"Outstanding new restaurant! Had a wonderfully balanced shakshuka on soft bread as a filling but not too heavy breakfast. Would definitely come back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I've eaten a tonne of lunch bowls from various restaurants (iq  crave, fit for life). Plancha is undoubtedly the tastiest. I had the power for the people with an add on of hallumi cheese. Great flavour, large portion. My hunger was satiated which is rather rare when eating \"healthy\". Housemade lemonade was fantastic and not syrupy or too sweet. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I really like the idea of Plancha and I REALLY wanted to like the restaurant!! The decor is beautiful and I really like the vibe they're going for. (How many more times can I say \"like\" and \"really\" in a paragraph?) Unfortunately, Plancha is very expensive and very oily. I think I went the third day they opened, so I can see how the owners will keep learning and improving based on feedback and whatnot. 

Plancha should get on Ritual at some point because their line was absolutely INSANE. (I think it would also be better for them, since there are a million restaurants in the Financial District, and most of them are on some sort of mobile app anyway.) There were only 2 chefs in the back and waiting took a long LONG long time. Not only did you have to wait to order, but you also had to wait to get your order. I think I was in the restaurant for 30 minutes just waiting. 30 minutes is a crazy long time, especially since most people are on their 1-hour lunch break. I ordered the Power to the People plunch box with the organic spelt flatbread and added chicken. I also got a Plancha latte. (This doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore? It's just the not iced version of their latte.)  The total came out to be almost $25!!!! 

The organic spelt was delicious. I could just eat that all day and the first few bites of the Power to the People bowl were SO TASTY and seemed to be worth the price. But then you start getting to the bottom of the bowl, and you realize you've eaten/drank half a cup of oil. The oil was so heavy and I couldn't believe I was consuming so much of it. Look at all that oil stain in my picture! That's pretty nasty. The nasty oil took away a lot of my appetite. I didn't want to eat anything drowned in that, especially since all their food was supposed to be \"healthy\" and \"organic.\" 

The Plancha latte was not that good either. I don't know if I was supposed to be drinking the lavender seeds? I thought the latte would just be infused with the seeds and then taken out. I didn't know my latte would have seeds in them. The taste was too overwhelming and I definitely did not like it. I first tried to take the seeds out, but there were too many of them! I ended up throwing it away, which was quite unfortunate since that latte was almost 7 dollars. 

I believe the oiliness came from the chicken though. I'm not sure.. if I were to come back, I wouldn't get any additions, though I probably would never come back to the restaurant because I don't work in the Financial District anymore. 

TLDR; Don't order the Plancha latte and don't add any additions to your box. That might be the source of the mysterious ocean of oil. I'm thinking a regular plunch box COULD be worth the price, but haven't tried that myself."}
{"text":"Cute little spot! Very nice decor. It's more of a lunch take out spot but they do have some seating. 

Food is delicious, my dish was basically like a delicious salad on top of a flatbread. I had the Vasco, which had bits of salmon on it as well. 

Only criticism is even though there is some seating and we were eating in, we just got our food in takeout containers which seems pretty wasteful - the black plastic which can't be recycled."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! So many veggie options so many flavours such good tastes. 100% recommend this to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Good quality food, nice flavour combinations, great vibe.  Personally I get more enjoyment for my $10-15 lunch here than I do at many other places in the financial district.  There is more care taken in food prep than a lot of other places nearby that just cram trendy-sounding ingredients into a box which doesn't necessarily taste that good.  Kudos to the owners for putting a more culinary spin on the concept!  I do feel like they could fit a little more seating in the space."}
{"text":"Great new place. I had the 12:10 to Marrakech sandwich.  Beautifully prepared and balanced flavours."}
{"text":"I ordered their wild mushroom soup and couldn't finish it. It didn't taste good and I had a headache after drinking it. It was also very overpriced at $8 for a small cup and 5 sticks of thin bread. There seems to be favouritism amongst customers as well as I noticed other people being treated more warmly than me. I will never return"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out as it was a hop skip away from work--hoping for a great new lunch spot.  The decided to try the Fainting Preist: Grilled eggplant, tomato bruschetta, sumac, wild oregano, tahini, sheep milk feta, organic mixed greens, with lemon roasted garlic vinaigrette ($10.95) and it was good, but for me a tad boring and quite heavy.  I learned later that they could have provided chillies (which should have been an option).  It was great if you have dietary restrictions but it was not my cup of team and at that price point for lunch--with a coffee/drink it was a $16 meal I would prefer a meal a bit more flavourful.

The wait time was quite long about 13 minutes after I ordered and before that it was a 10 minute wait time to order... maybe I didn't try the right item but regardless just not my cup of tea.

Ambiance and design was beautiful.  There is a coffee counter as well and they do make a great drip!"}
{"text":"What a cute little spot to find by the bay St suit scene. Eat in or take out breakie and Lunch wit coffee creations on the side.  Love the music transporting me to a warmer climate.  I ordered some all day breakfast named Planchuka with org eggs eggplant mixed greens and grilled flatbread on the side.  Overall a nice light flavorfull mix if your looking for some protein.  I didn't see much eggplant but the flatbread made me happy as it was delicious. Next time I'll try a salad A welcome change to the Underground path same ol food choices"}
{"text":"Also happy with this place! My favourite is the God's Land with smoked tofu and feta."}
