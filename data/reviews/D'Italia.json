{"text":"I am a clean freak I notice things like dirty glass and  floors this place is definitely five star clean everything sparkles really nice and clean upfront you can see what they do none of this behind the scenes dirty kitchen"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS ITALIAN BEEF (although I still call it by a less politically correct name...four letters, starting with \"D\" and ending with \"o\").  Beef, roll and seasoning were all top notch and I have had some good ones to compare.  Having it \"dunked\" made it even better!  Will be back for more. Hopefully you survive the endless road construction."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  I have only been here for lunch, but lots of take home options for dinner as well.  The meatball sub is amazing and even on special during Meatball Monday's!  A little more expensive than subway but the service is great and the food even better!"}
{"text":"Great little place. You spend 7bucks at subway... Just pay the extra dollar and come here to get a real good sub"}
{"text":"Best Italian Beef sandwich I've had in years. Just the right seasoning, melt-in-the-mouth tender beef, on a roll that stands up to the challenge of a juicy wet sandwich.  Superb! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Wow glad I was 2 hours early for an apt and found this gem!  Cute Mom and pop.  Italian beef is amazing can't wait to come back and try other offerings!"}
{"text":"The Italian sub would have been great, if it weren't for the fact I bit into a broken piece of the plastic knife they used to cut it. Why they decided to use a flimsy object to cut into a crispy hardened bread is beyond me.  Somehow halfway through eating the sandwich and actually enjoying it the end piece almost cracked a tooth. Careless mistakes ruined my appetite and chance for returning, in the off chance I will find some odd foreign object in a pasta dish. Shame."}
{"text":"I hated this place.   The food was bad the dessert was old. There was also bugs flying around when I was in there"}
{"text":"Very good place for sandwiches!  I love their Italian beef sandwich, the cookies, and the mac salad.  They are a no frills place that just serves great food with a friendly attitude."}
{"text":"A really cute place with really good sandwiches. My husband had the Italian sub and I had the chicken parm. The bread is really soft and chewy but also crisp. Husband said the cannoli (filled to order) was delicious too.  The service was friendly and warm. I'd return for sure!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and so glad we did. The lasagna my wife had was excellent and the Italian beef with hot peppers was so good. I definitely would recommend this place. The workers were very nice also."}
{"text":"For all of you that have been stalking this place, they are finally open. I came in today for lunch and I liked what I saw. This place is definitely a take out destination, but if your in a crunch there are 3 bistro tables available.   Before ordering, I took the time to look on the shelf's and in the coolers to see what all they have here. On the shelf's, they have multiple gift baskets already prepared, packaged pretty and ready to go. They have a few Italian specialty items such as olives, capers, etc. Lots of pastries, cookies, cheesecake and cannoli's. Plenty of fresh soup in nice Tupperware in the fridge, ready for you to heat up and eat. Then, the holy grail of any Italian kitchen... fresh pasta of all kinds, priced right. They also took the liberty of making some salads and having those ready to go in the fridge as well. I believe they had chef, caesar and house salads already made.    For anybody who does lunch in Westlake, please come in and check this place out. Lets talk food options, shall we? Pizza by the slice, $2, looks good and filling. I tried the white pizza. I believe it has alfredo sauce, mozzarella cheese and caramelized onions. It's filling, made fresh and just really darn good. Italian sausage and peppas (ya, I said it) which I can personally vouch for, as I ordered this as well. Freshly baked sub roll, they topped it with cheese and then it goes under the oven to get nice and meltey (I will add mustard next time). Any kind of sub you want, topped anyway you want (this is a deli people). Or, you can get fresh pasta, with any sauce you want (marinara, alfredo or white clam) add any meat for a couple bucks (meatballs, sausage, chicken cutlet, chicken parm). They do have veal, but I don't condone eating it....  All in all, this is a small place with just the right amount of options to not overwhelm you. It's owner operated, you can tell they take pride in everything they do and are super friendly and accommodating. The pricing is just right for lunch, average price for a sub was about $7 (and they are big). You could spend a little more or a little less depending on what you order. I will definitely be coming back, not only for a fast and affordable lunch, I'm also looking forward to stopping into the deli for fresh baked Italian bread and freshly shaved (or sliced) lunch meats and cheeses. Then to put the cherry on top, some fresh Italian deserts. Viva D'Italia!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Reasonably priced.  Pick up on way home from work when I need a pasta fix.  Italian sausage amazing.  Have never had anything from here that wasn't 5 stars."}
{"text":"Italian beef was amazing. On par if not better than Portillo's and Al's Beef of Chi-Town. Gotta try the rest of the menu but the beef sandwich will make us come back no matter what."}
{"text":"The Italian Beef Sandwich is the best french dip I've had, and I've had many comparisons as its my favorite meal.   The pepperoni bread was popular at a party, but I wasn't overly impressed.  Overall, the menu is overpriced but if you find something that you enjoy it might be worth the treat."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian Beef, fair prices and friendly staff. Great little deli, can't wait to try the pasta."}
{"text":"Great little spot off I90 - there's a few fast food joints right off the freeway, but go just a little further and you'll hit this gem. Well worth driving the extra 50 feet!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to me because I would be a regular. As soon as you walk in you can tell and smell there isn't a bad item on the menu! Was in the area and decided to grab lunch and decided on this small Italian place. You can tell this place has regulars because It seemed that everyone who walked in knew the employees by name, overall a good atmosphere. Everyone was kind and curtesy as if I'd been there multiple times before. I ended up getting the Italian Beef with cheese and peppers. It was great, I only wish I would've ordered multiple things to take back with me because I don't frequent the area too often. So if you're in the area, do yourself a favor and stop by!"}
{"text":"My mom and I were looking for a local place to get some lunch. After reading the reviews, I was sold on trying an Italian Beef sandwich, no cheese. I am so glad I did. I have driven past a umber of times and seen the sign, but haven't been in until today. My mom got the d'Italia Italian cold cut sandwich with all the fixings. She had it cold. I tried a bite and loved it, but I would have had it hot/ pressed. We both were very impressed with our sandwiches. I also tried the tiramisu and was so pleased. It is my favorite dessert and I have to say it was well done. A great mix of coffee-flavored mixed into the lady fingers and perfect mascarpone cream luxuriousness sprinkled with cocoa. Just a touch of sweet, but pure yum!  They also have a bunch of pick up meals in the fridge/freezer. I would happily eat lunch here at any of the 3 bistro tables or take it down to the lake to enjoy.  I look forward to picking up a meal as well to feed my kids as they are pasta junkies and this is the real deal. Great staff and service, too."}
{"text":"So I saw a sign for Italian Beef and I cut across two lanes and turned in. It was well worth the illegal maneuver! Bread was fresh, sandwiches were flavorful and pasta salad was on point. Staff was friendly and the location is easy in and out.  If you leave without getting a cannoli you are doing yourself a severe disservice, they fill them to order! My GF's Snapchat read \"Best thing I've ever put in my mouth\""}
{"text":"The food could have been steaming piles of hot garbage and I would still go back for the service, but luckily the food was delicious as well. We have nothing but great things to say about our catering experience. We ordered pasta, pizza, and salad for 80 people and were not disappointed. The staff was kind and courteous, assisting in loading our order into our car and checking the order multiple times for accuracy. We will be going back and recommending to friends!"}
{"text":"I'm very happy that a mini-gallucis opened on the Westside! I've been here a bunch of times and everything is always fresh and the owners are very friendly.   Only place I know in Cleveland with Authentic Chicago style Italian beef which is excellent. They also have some of the best Pepperoni Bread, Italian bread, and  meatballs I've had to date. They also serve as a deli, with an nice array of cheeses, deli meats, olives(castelvetrano), potato/macaroni salad, and some sweets too.   Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Buy a D'Italia sandwich.  Today, 3-8-17, the D'Italia sandwiches were wrapped in cellophane and were stacked on the checkout counter.  This was, no kidding, the BEST thing I've eaten in a couple months.  It's a man-sized sandwich)--I would guess the weight at between 12-16 oz, filled w/everything you would expect in THE perfect Italian sandwich.  The dough is similar to Stromboli bread, yet even thinner and better than any I've had elsewhere.  At $5, I hate to say this: it's totally underpriced.  The pizza is priced at $3 a slice (approx size 4x4 or maybe 5x5\"--way generous.  My friend got a meatball sub and could only eat half at one sitting as it was very large but really good.  Lots of interesting prepped & cooked take out foods.  I love this place.  I will absolutely return for those sandwiches."}
{"text":"My family lives nearby and this place is a staple for us. I usually head in with ambitions of trying new things on the menu but I can never get past the house Italian sub (the d'italia) or the Italian beef (I'd have to have it side by side with a true Chicago Italian beef to tell which is better!!). Oh, and then there's the meatball sub... It can go toe to toe with the best of them. Homemade meatballs (trust me, you'll know when you have one), and more than generously portioned.   If I'm lucky enough to be in when they still have pepperoni bread on the counter I always get one. Best around. Bottom line, if you're contemplating it, try it. I hope they stay in my neighborhood for a long long time!!!"}
{"text":"Great subs and sandwiches. I have been in here several times. The owner has always been in and cooking. Open during lunch and until early evening. The Italian beef is very good. Subs are fresh made to order and $6-9.00 each. You get what you pay for. If you want a $5 foot long, it isn't here. But it is worth every penny extra.   They do a pretty good take out business but you can eat inside at the several small tables. I surprised there isn't more reviews and comments about this place on Yelp. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"great food and great people but in my opinion the prices of the food is definitely overpriced - i'm sure they have a huge overhead here in westlake and their own building but when i frequent an establishment type such as theirs i would like to eat lunch and soda and a small side item for 10$ or less. this is more like a 13-15$ place. too pricey for lunch and i work down the road"}
{"text":"Very friendly owners (from the East Side of CLE actually). The reviews for the Italian Beef persuaded me to stray a little from my recent routine that includes as much fiber a possible during breakfast and lunch. Gladly, I indulged in said sandwich with no regret. Get the giardinara and cheese melted. This place will make you feel happy and glad you're a human being."}
{"text":"Just OK.  Everything I have had in several visits seems just flat.  Italian beef, eggplant sandwich, pizza slices all seem to need something more to make them memorable."}
{"text":"Great place! Definitely authentic Italian food! Staff is friendly and I would highly recommend to my friends and family."}
{"text":"I was craving a really good Italian sausage and peppers, just like you get from the stands at the fair. I found this place near my work, and its AMAZING! We plan to come here all the time for lunch now. So cute inside with foods that are prepared and uncooked so you can take them home and cook them yourself! Love it!   Also- My sausage was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Great place. Can't say enough about this great little Italian deli. I go at least once a week. The de'italia sub is fantastic. Italian beef, meatball sub, sausage & pizza, wedding soup great. I have had nothing but great meals here. My favorite deli by far. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian beef sandwiches I ever had. Very well made,very tasty. I also had some homemade mac salad which was very good as well.  Bookmaking this place,will be back next time I'm in area."}
{"text":"I stopped in tonight after meaning to visit D'Italia for quite some time.  I had high hopes after reading the reviews that I would find amazing Italian beef that rivaled Chicago's Portillo's.  When I arrived, there was plenty of parking spaces and the store had 3 people in line ahead of me.  I ordered my italian beef sandwich without peppers, but with cheese. I also grabbed a slice of tiramisu from the refrigerator before checking out.  The sandwich only took a few minutes to wait and they packaged it and the au jus tightly to go.  The italian beef was good, but I think I just had too high of hopes and was craving something just like Portillo's.  Unfortunately, while the sandwich was good, it just wasn't quite a substitute for my Portillo's craving.  The beef itself was good.  It tasted like it melted in your mouth.  However, it lacked a bit of seasoning that I would typically equate with italian beef and felt more like a french dip.  That being said, it still tasted really good and I'll definitely go back for it, but a little seasoning could have gone a long way.  I'm also used to a dipped italian beef where the sandwich is soaked in au jus, but the tiny cup of au jus wasn't really sufficient to be used in that manner.  Next visit, I'll ask for extra.  The bread is tasty, but has a harder outside, unlike a softer Gonella roll, so you really need a lot of au jus to permeate through the roll.  The tiramisu was amazing.  It is heavy on the mascarpone and less on the lady fingers, but the lady fingers were still so sufficiently soaked in espresso that you got a strong taste to it.  I'm a big fan of the cold custard-like taste of mascarpone and prefer the ratio of mascarpone to lady fingers to favor the mascarpone, so it was a perfect treat for me.  Outside of that, the general experience was great.  Everybody was really friendly and helpful.  The prices are very fair and I was able to get my sandwich and tiramisu for under $12.  They also offer a variety of pastas that I will definitely be trying on my next visit, as well as their fill-to-order canolis."}
{"text":"Very nice looking restaurant. Too bad there's not much in the way of seating. HOWEVER, I was blown away by the food! I got the chicken cutlets, garlic bread, and a salad. My wife got the lasagna, garlic bread, and a salad.... Incredible deliciousness!  Too bad we're not from the area or we'd be going there every week! Bottom line; Best Italian food we've ever had!"}
{"text":"Awesome friendly neighborhood place.  The sandwiches are amazing. Best Italian beef sandwich I've ever had.  Only 3 small bistro tables to sit, so I wouldn't go with a big group to eat there.  But don't hesitate to grab a bite - it's the bomb."}
{"text":"Huge fan! The Italian Beef is a must try. Fast, friendly service. Big portions. What more could you ask for?  Oh try the tortellini salad, you won't be disappointed!  What a gem!"}
{"text":"D'Italia is our new favorite go-to place for impromptu family gatherings. We just call family/friends to gather at our place, then swing by D'Italia for some delicious food. Our typical order consists of a mixture of 6 or 7 entrees (big enough to share), maybe a sub or two and some garlic bread. Hot and ready, it's a real crowd-pleaser and also easy to keep warm, if needed. Whatever you do, don't forget the cannolis! I can't believe I wasted 43 years of my life never having tried one. Don't know what \"others\" taste like, but these are to die for!!"}
{"text":"I had bookmarked this place and finally had a chance to try it for lunch.  OH MY GOODNESS! What have I been missing!! The Italian beef sandwich (w/cheese) was amazing!!! THE best I ever had!  I got the hot pepper sauce on the side, good thing because I like spicy hot food, and I put one pepper on a each bite and by the end my lips were a bit fire-Y, but in a good way.  The au jus is delectable.  The beef was so tender and on that crusty bread, my taste buds were dancing! My Italian blood was singing!     I must also mention the girl at the counter was super pleasant !  I was by myself and I ate at 1 of the 3 tables.  It was perfect.  Can't wait to bring others here and to try different items!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are fresh! Sandwiches are a fantastic portion. They have loads of other goodies in the fridge to take home as well. Everyone passes it, you need to stop in! Once you go there you'll kick yourself for not stopping sooner."}
{"text":"First time I ever stopped in here. I had great service and a great sandwich. I had their Italian Sub  (the D'Italia Sub) and I got it loaded with all the toppings. It was a good lunch today. I will be back."}
{"text":"Bravo! Stopped here for lunch on a whim, and boy am I glad I did. Had a big slice of vegetable pizza with pesto sauce. OUTSTANDING! They offered warm it in the oven before serving. The crust was medium thick, but light. How do you do that so well? The pesto sauce was delicious, topped with tomatoes, roasted red peppers, onion, pepperoncini, and cheese. Not yet satiated, i tried their castelvetrano olives & a limoncello cookie. Yum! Looks like they have quite a menu of hot and cold subs, salads, and pasta dishes. Salads and desserts in the cooler all looked good. There is also a deli counter with Italian meats and salads, and a freezer with frozen goodies.  Relatively easy to find off of I-90 at the intersection of Detroit & Canterbury, east of Crocker.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"2 1/2 years after my first review, and I absolutely need to compliment D'Italia again!  Made the journey north to the big city from my rural abode and stopped by for another great Italian Beef Sandwich.  It was as GREAT as the one in my original review below.  But this time I tried the white pizza too.  Oh My Oh My!!  I was blown away with the dough!  I have made pizza for 50 years, and would give anything to know their recipe and work flow on this beauty!  The center was pillowy soft, the crust was egg shell crisp, the cornice was utter buttery heaven!  Oh and the cheese, the cheese... the best in the world!  In the counter display was Grande Provolone and Sorrento Mozzarella.  Imagine that, the two brands that I respect above all others for pizza.  Finally if your feeling low, go to D'Italia, the smile of the woman working the register and taking orders will melt the heart of the most curmudgeon among us, and the food will amaze your palate!"}
{"text":"I always forget about this place but they seriously have the best Italian beef subs! Staff are always so friendly!"}
{"text":"Great Selection with great prices.   The staff is always so friendly and kind.  I head over to D'Italia at least once a week for lunch.  My favorite is the D'Italia Sub with roasted red peppers.  The salads are always fresh with great toppings.  Can't go wrong with a sausage sandwich either."}
