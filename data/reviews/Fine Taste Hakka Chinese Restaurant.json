{"text":"Good food, close to home! Hit and sour soup -good, shrimp pakora - awesome!!!! Chili chicken - average, mancherian beef _ not good...  Service great! I'll be back for the pakora alone!!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken pakoras I have had to date and trust us we are quite the hakka fans and have tried a lot of them in Scarborough. Love the sauce they give with the pakoras too.  We also recommend the bombay chicken. Good portions, will get your moneys worth"}
{"text":"Best Hakka in Ajax.... love the chicken pakora and chili chicken.... big portions!!! have not done dine in..... only done take out"}
{"text":"Jamaican style Chinese food. Reasonable price, ready in 15-20 minutes. Oh my so good! Best in ajax for sure! Try the mancherian chicken rice and baja chicken. Good mango salad. Spicy!"}
{"text":"Lunch Special On Weekends!!! Soup spring roll and my favourite chilli chicken. I love this place. I'm use to going to China cottage in Scarborough but this is minutes from place in Ajax and the food is comparable. I found the food to be fresh and worth the $. Atmosphere is nice too. Half lunch with the family."}
{"text":"Taste need improvement... a lot. Not the worst Hakka but not the best. Taste should come alive & dishes need to taste distinguished from each other. Spice control is not where It should be!! There is a reason culinary world has 3 simple spice level mild, medium & spicy. And cook needs to practice sticking with what spice level customers decide for their order. Seating arrangement is better than ok. clean as well."}
{"text":"Very good food... corn and crab soup, sesame chicken and Cantonese noodles are always our go to  just wish they delivered"}
{"text":"Best food ever I tasted in my Canadian history. I was from Toronto and I never ever tried food like this before...!"}
{"text":"Service is quick, water placement utensils provided quickly,clean restaurant,  they take out and deliver. They have huge portions for the price you pay you can order three items feed 6 at least. Everything tastes pretty good, they just need to work on their appetizers ie. Pakoras huge tennis balls. A must to try: Bombay Fish/manchurian fried rice and ginger beef. They have quick service so if you change your mind order while your there and get your meal."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Hakka Chinese restaurant in Durham region.  My wife and I have come here 7 times in the past two months. It's that good guys.  My go to dishes are the chili chicken with gravy and special leg and back chicken fried rice.  The spicy pepper shrimp is delicious and so is the Bombay fish. The portions are generous and taste is always on point.  This place is usually packed with take out orders.  The service is excellent and the guy always give us suggestions on what to try. This is a hidden gem give Fine Taste a try."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Hakka place! I've been to many hakka places over the past few years but I could not have imagined that my favorite would be so close to home.   The lunch special is an amazing value and the portions are plentiful(I can have one for three days).  If you're new to hakka food i'd recommend you try the chili chicken.   I make sure to always grab i bite from  here whenever i am in Ajax."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty...standard hakka menu items. Ordered pakkora, shrimp fried rice and chilli chicken. Really happy for more food choices so close to home. Good portions, overall good value. Will order again."}
{"text":"Best  chinese food in Durham.  Portion sizes are huge and the quality and taste are excellent. Clean and friendly family run business.  Been here over a dozen times. We love the crispy ginger chicken. Also recommend chicken wing fried rice..consistently good food!!! Give it a try"}
{"text":"Fantastic. This place is amazing the food is super authentic and tasty. service was amazing they were attentive and provided extra bowls and plates without prompt. Ordered Corn soup, hakka chicken, eggplant, beef bittermelon - all amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment! Shrimp pakora served cold, with even an ice-cold partially frozen shrimp inside one of them. In the house fried rice, the chicken had my companion spitting out gristle. Chili chicken was off-tasting at worst and boring at best. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Best Hakka in Ajax. Quick, friendly service. Huge portions. I don't know what is in those Hakka noodles but they are so tasty!  The flavour is to die for. Manchuria beef or chick, Hakka chili chicken, every time I have been, I am pleased!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent food that delivers more on taste, and not as spicy hot as most Hakka places out there - which is the way we like it! We especially love the crispy shrimp pakoras & Szechuan fish. The place is nice, clean, & bright. The food arrived to the table fairly quickly, and the customer service was okay, but nothing excellent. Will come back again on the future for the food!"}
{"text":"I'm from the Scarborough area so I know my Hakka, tried this place based on reviews and because I was in the Ajax area.    Pros:  Big portions.   Cons:  Unfortunately it wasn't to my expectations, the food was mediocre.  Also, I ordered a Pi√±a Colada mock-tail and was also disappointed as it was a slushy type imitation."}
{"text":"Been going to this establishment for the last year or so- the staff are great, food is beyond delicious and the portions are huge!! A few of my favourites are the General Tao Shrimp, Crispy Ginger Beef and of course the spicy chicken wings on the appetizer menu are to die for!!! My boyfriend loves the Spicy Garlic Fish, can't get enough of their Chili Chicken and always pairs his food with their Hakka noodles instead of the rice- We eat here at least once a week and never leave disappointed"}
{"text":"Great place for Hakka Chinese food in Ajax. They are very comparable to China Cottage. The prices are great and the servings are plentiful. We had enough for 2.5 meals! The ginger beef is very good and tastes just as good as he ginger beef from Calgary. And always order the shrimp pakoras! They are to die for."}
{"text":"Just gets better and better.  This is now a family favourite where we return here very often.  We of course got the chili chicken dry, Hakka noodles with chicken thighs, and a new dish, crispy ginger beef. Super delicious and great service even on new year's eve.  Highly recommended to try."}
{"text":"I had the best Hakka noodles in the gta at this spot and trust me I've tried multiple spots around downtown and none were even close in flavour to these noodles. My bf had the Spicy garlic fish and  he too enjoyed his meal. The size, price,quality and service of this spot were phenomenal."}
{"text":"I have not had any bad experiences eating here ever their food is wonderful and I'm picky my favorite is the Manchurian beef with gravy and the Manchurian style rice. Their General tso is  sweet with lots of sauce and their chicken pakora is yummy as well. Love eating there!!!"}
{"text":"In town visiting family and ordered food (thanks Yelpers) - was amazing and portions are very generous.  We enjoyed the chicken curry, shrimp pakora, black bean vegetables, hakka noodles and more.  Delivery was good, food warm and fresh.  Vegetables crisp and delicious.  The curry spring rolls were delish.  Definately enjoyable food, with good size family portions, swift delivery and cooked fresh.  Recommend this place for sure - takes credit card at delivery. - shrimp samosa's had a good write up but they were no much shrimp too much batter for my liking."}
{"text":"Did a take out yesterday. Their portions are HUUUGEE! I got Ginger chicken with Fried Rice and the total came upto 12ish bucks. I have a big appetite and always finish my meal but I couldn't finish theirs, thats how big their portion was. The taste was pretty good as well, will definitely be returning to the place. Fine Taste Indeed!"}
{"text":"The new best Chinese Hakka food in Durham region hands-down   Five stars for price Five stars for taste Five stars for customer service  Very impressed chef here!"}
{"text":"I like Hakka food and was excited to try something closer to home.  Unfortunately, it was disappointing.  We had an eggplant dish and a beef dish.  I found the meat chewy and not super appetizing, and both dishes were doused with a bland, cornstarch-thickened sauce that was not appealing.  The portions were good, however we did not even want to finish the dishes.  Nothing bad to say about the service, and the place was clean and tiny.  But I do think they need to improve their recipes and flavours and not \"dumb\" it down.  I've had much better meals in lots of different places in Toronto and Mississauga.  Would recommend you look elsewhere if you're craving good Hakka food."}
{"text":"Chili spicy seafood mix was fantastic and the spicy kick is wonderful but it's real too chili :)"}
{"text":"Decent hakka food. Not the best I've had but may be the best in Durham Region. (GTA is much better)."}
{"text":"Super awesome Hakka Chinese.  Crispy gobhi awesome Veg noodles awesome  Fried fish excellent   Loved having such yummy food at a very affordable price."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of Hakka Restaurants in the GTA, and I can honestly say, this was not one of the better ones.   I ordered my standard chili chicken with gravy, chicken pakoras and veggie hakka noodles.   The chili chicken had some pretty tough cuts of meat, which wasn't that enjoyable, the chicken pakoras were actually pretty good. They were large, well seasoned, and spicy! Teh veggie hakka noodles were also decent, the noodle were thick and tasty, and they even added bok choy which was a nice touch. However , it was incredibly oily.  The steamed rice they gave was also super small and they did not provide the standard green chilies in vinegar or red chili sauce.   The service was fast and they do offer a 10% discount if you pay in cash.   Highly doubtful I will return."}
{"text":"The best Hakka cuisine in Durham Region . Hands down. Recommended dishes: Bombay chicken ,pakoras, thai green curry and pad Thai.                                           The portions are INCREDIBLY HUGEEEEE!!!!  This is my 7th time coming this month.   Lots of love goes to this place.  Their service is exceptional as well!  ** DISCLAIMER: the reviewer has been paid for by the establishment for a measly sum of fifty cents"}
{"text":"Probably the freshest and tastiest Hakka and halal Chinese resto in Durham.  As good as tangerine but much less busy.   Also it's located in a really handy plaza where they have a OnceUponAchild next door.  So bring your used children items like toys, books, clothes, etc and get some $$ to pay for your Chinese food!"}
{"text":"So happy I tried this place! Probably one of my favourite Hakka restaurants now.  I tried the spicy Manchurian chicken fried rice, spicy pepper shrimp, chilli chicken (with gravy) and crispy ginger beef. All four dishes were to die for!! It tasted amazing.   The service was okay, despite the staff being kind, they didn't really do much. We had to always make eye contact/call them if we needed them."}
{"text":"They have this Mumbai chicken which was something new I have ever tried, taste pretty good for their 6 dollar combo"}
{"text":"I had the chili chicken and fried rice. Not what I expected but then again it is Pickering."}
{"text":"This review is for the spicy garlic chicken lunch special. First they start with a bed of rice. I chose fried rice for $1 more. Then they add the meat of your choice. I got the spicy garlic chicken which they serve breaded. You can choose this option dry or with gravy. I chose gravy on the side. I tried it first without the gravy and the meat was dry and lacked any source of flavor. I then added the gravy and let it sit for a couple minutes. The chicken then got a little soggy and the rice got a little mushy. They give you a lot of food  as the special comes with a spring roll but the price of the special will jump to around $10 bucks if you sub fried rice and add a drink. Overall, I would try something else but I wouldn't recommend the spicy garlic chicken!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Big portion. Staff was very friendly and the place was big and very clean. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Chilli chicken is to die for.  The only place in town we go!  Highly recommend.  You get your money's worth."}
