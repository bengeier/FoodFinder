{"text":"I was invited to a friend's celebration here. Majority of the customers there were Eastern Europeans, so this will be an unbiased review from a fellow Asian. It is beautiful inside in contrast to its surroundings. The saying \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" applies here. The inside has a classic, but lavish feel from its interior to decor. There is a bar section with a large TV screen. The place also plays Balkan music. Speaking of music, sometimes this place turns into a concert venue (thought it doesn't look like because I thought the space was a little too tight for performance and audience). Plenty of space for parking and the inside of the cafe seems very clean.

Now to the food.... I didn't order anything because the food were ordered ahead of time for us. Family style sharing of kupus  (Yugoslavian shredded cabbage salad, which is delicious), bread, cevapi (Balkan version of sausage), spicy sausage, schnitzel with cheese and pork, fresh potato fries, some kebobs and veggies. The cevapi was delicious. Was not dry at all and full of flavor. I didn't try the kebobs because the buttons on my jeans were about to break after I ate everything else LOL jk. I wish I did though. The fries were delicious, not your typical American fries. I had ice coffee topped with whip cream. Yummy! I believe they have some specials as well.

Overall satisfied with the place. I believe the guy that was serving us is one of the owners, but whomever he was, he seemed very accommodating. I can't fully give 5 star yet because I haven't experienced the \"night life\" part of the cafe. When I do though, I will edit this review. However, I do recommend this place for hanging out or having a big party."}
{"text":"I absolutely fell in love with this place and will be back! I originally went to Club Cloud N9ne which is a Hookah Dance Club right next door but since they didn't serve alcohol, I came here - and am very glad that I did! Although the drink prices aren't cheap, the place is gorgeous, the decor is amazing and upscale and the beer selection is not the best but they carry the basics. I think what is unique about them, is that I saw liquor there from Eastern Europe, so buy something special when you are there, or ask the bartender or a Serbian what they recommend, be adventurous! 

What's special about it, is that it's indeed a Serbian bar! Yes, that's right, a Serbian bar! I was there on a night where a special musician from Chicago was playing live and it was beautiful. Around 1:30 it ended and until 2 they played EDM/electronic music, which was interesting. I preferred the Serbian cultural music, it reminded me of Russian music, super nice! Oh and there was no cover for ladies that night. 

They crowd was nearly 100% Serbian so if you're not, you may stick out like a sore thumb but if you dress nicely and maybe mingle a bit, you'll be fine. Also, the ages ranged from early 20's to early 50's so don't be afraid, join in. :)"}

{"text":"I can't believe there is actually more than one Serbian restaurant in town and both are only a few miles apart. So, my experience here is colored by the fact that I'm a super-fan of Old Town Sarajevo. I didn't expect this place to be equally as fantastic but at least solid. So, armed with that knowledge, I cannot bring myself to give this place more than two so-so stars. 

At first I thought it was quirky when I read that this place has Italian and Serbian menus. But apparently, a new owner took over about a month ago and decided to revise the menu and put the Serbian menu all in Serbian (!). I asked the manager/sole server if they had an English version--even though I already knew what the answer was: No. His suggestion: \"You can just Google everything.\" True but what about customers who don't have smart phones? Sigh.

This place is in a strip mall--of course. You walk in and the interior is quite spacious. But it seemed like we were in a cheesy hotel restaurant in Las Vegas. There were big columns, a bar, speakers and lots of plastic trees. What was also kind of eerie was that except for two women and their rambunctious two children, the place was empty. And this was a Saturday night. There were about seven or eight people on the front patio. But most of them were men smoking and chatting and taking their time before ordering any food. Not a good sign that so few people came between 6 and 8 p.m. on a Saturday. I know it was Labor Day weekend but still...if this place is still around in a year, I will start to wonder if there is a Serbian mafia.

Because of my cold, I asked if I could get a cup of hot water which seemed to really throw our server. I thought if the place serves hot tea, they might offer it. But he said he could only give me hot water from the tap. I dunno, I just thought it was strange a request like that would weird a restaurant worker out. 

Now onto the food. I had chicken soup because I was trying to fight off a cold. It was fine, not too salty as chicken soup tends to be. It hit the right spot but it's just a footnote. What I was really eager to try was their take on the cevapi. Basically a sausage sandwich. I was quite disappointed. Maybe I wouldn't be if it weren't for how other places turned me onto Serbian food. The sausages were fine and had enough seasonings. But the bread was blech. They were like giant crumpets/English muffins, not pita bread. The outside had charred streaks which tells you it was in an oven. But the underside of both pieces of bread had the texture of those last bites of French toast that have been sitting in the syrup too long. It just wasn't pleasant on the tongue. The plate came with onions and sour cream. 

I was disappointed that the new menu dropped some items I wanted to try like stuffed cabbage rolls. I think this new owner needs to restore a few things. However, I doubt I will come here again just because I know where I can get similar food that's better tasting in my opinion. But I do wish them well."}
