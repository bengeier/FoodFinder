{"text":"The hubster and I stopped in early on a recent weekend afternoon for sandwiches and suds. I ordered the blackened tilapia; he ordered the buffalo chicken. Both sammies benefitted greatly from the removal of the wilty, off-tasting lettuce and mealy tomatoes. After that, I had a \"meh, not bad\" impression of my sandwich, even though the tilapia was really too salty for my taste (and I am a FAN of salt). But the hubby's sandwich? BADNESS. Buffalo chicken is his absolute favorite sandwich, and he orders it whenever he sees one on a menu. So he KNOWS what he's getting into. The buffalo chicken was grilled, hubster was disappointed to find (even though it DID actually say that on the menu and I was secretly happy because it's HEALTHIER that way). But worse, it was completely overpowered by copious amounts of EXTREMELY strong bleu cheese (again, we both LIKE bleu cheese, so...just WOW). He was not a happy camper. The fries were okay, but nothing to write home about. 

At least the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Your typical sports bar TV overload.  Just fine."}
{"text":"So happy we stopped in here today for lunch. Tremendous portions, delicious food and great service. Can't wait to come back here again soon. Gotta try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere, game room for kids, shuffle board, lots of micro brews on tap.  Love it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's been an average experience; however, this last experience was horrible. Our server / bartender Stephen was brutal. He was not social, made offensive (racist)  comments & insisted that we left 2 hours before close time, as well as, made us leave at halftime of the NBA finals. Being that I am a bartender, I know that I would never hand a customer there check and tell them we are closing; if anything I wait until the customer is ready to leave. Overall, I am really disappointed in this place, I would not go back. This was unacceptable behavior."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food! Not just a fantastic badger football game beer garden!"}
{"text":"Holiday weekend and 1st Badger game of the year. Only 2 bartenders and no service at the outside bar area. That is a bad thing. Typical for the luckys establishments."}
{"text":"Baked cod was pretty good. But the service was terrible.  Neither the host or the server knew what the happy hour special was. And when we finally found out, it was pretty weak.....$0.50 off rails and domestic taps. Boring!!!  Looks like a fun place to watch a have if you can't watch it at home. But we will never go there again."}
{"text":"Luckys is great for groups, or on your own. The fish fry on fridays is the best in madison (IMO) and the burgers are nothing short of amazing. Cheap drinks, good eats and a great staff make lucky's one of the best sports bars in madison. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, and there is lots of it per serving. The atmosphere is great for group events. Prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"This place is pretty chill big patio outside bar, bag toss, volleyball courts, bathrooms avialable outside near patio also. Food is decent. nice staff lots of tvs pool tables, and a wood stove."}
{"text":"Waunakee location.....good beer...over priced....food good...customer service lacking.....ordered deep fried cheese curds, bartender said kitchen lost order...did not comp. for mess up in  kitchen...bartender didn't not care about food mess up.  And guy sitting at table behind bar sat there for over 20 minutes before a older(maybe manager asked if he wanted anything.)  Very poor custmer service all around!  Would tell poeple to think twice about going to Waunakee Lucky's location!  Management needs a lot of work!"}
{"text":"Outstanding beer selection, better than average bar food and really good service. A solid place for lunch, dinner or late night shenanigans."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed. Never enough help! Had dinner 8 mos ago and had horribly slow service. Returned today thinking I'll give it another try. Not much better! Food is mediocre.  I realize you're trying to watch your personnel cost, but seriously is it worth sacrificing your customer service?  I know too many people in Waunakee that have boycotted this restaurant due to lack of service help. 
Seems as though most of the reviews say the same thing. Apparently management must not read them to bother to make any changes, which is too bad"}
{"text":"Very good service and food.

Large party of youth basketball players. Very accommodating, quick service, good food."}
{"text":"Had lunch during the Badger game today.  Service was VERY slow.  Food was skimpy portion and mediocre tasting.  Waunakee deserves better."}
{"text":"I go into Lucky's a lot on Thursday evenings. My buddy has children that go to music lessons across the street. We have a few beers while the kids are off being enriched.

Lucky's has an excellent beer selection and the food is pretty solid. The beer selection changes monthly. 

They have pizza cooked in a wood fired oven that's pretty good. My favorite is the specialty pizza which is pesto, grilled chicken, feta cheese, mozzarella cheese and spinach. The chicken alfredo pizza is pretty good too.

Of the sandwiches I particularly like the Ultimate Grilled Cheese, which has Swiss, American, and Provolone Cheese along with sliced tomato and bacon. I order that a LOT.

The also have a Mediterranean grilled cheese which has marinated artichokes, tomatoes, cream cheese, black olives, fire roasted red peppers and provolone cheese on toasted rye. That is quite tasty. But that particular sandwich has LOTS of stuff in it and so lacks structural rigidity and tends to blow up when you eat it, so be forwarned.

I greatly prefer Lucky's on quieter nights. When it's busy there is a lot of echo so it can be hard to carry on a conversation. Some of the bartenders are very sharp and there is one guy who always acts like he wishes he was someplace else and like he's doing you a favor by reluctantly getting you a beer.

They have a patio outside and a gas fireplace. Service there can be pretty hit and miss depending upon how busy it is inside. Also, they insist on playing music out there, and the volume is too high and the speaker distorts and I often don't like their choice of music. It would be better if it was quiet out there. 

I've had uniformly good luck going to Lucky's on Thursday evenings and I have been less impressed when I was there on weekends or other times when they're busy. I've had a couple pleasant evenings sitting outside by the fire when the crowd was small and the music was turned off."}
{"text":"Luckily for them, they were the only place in town available for what we needed. We reserved a side room where they said we could have it at 6 pm. They told me I couldn't bring in a cake for a birthday in the room, even though they don't offer dessert.

Then when we get to the room, nothing is set up, no menus, the LIGHTS weren't even on! We had to go to the bar for everything until I asked if we had a server for our side room. She was super sweet, but she told us no because they didn't have enough staff for tonight. One, it's a Badger game day AND Waunakee just had a basketball playoff game too, so they were bound to be busy.

We ordered appetizers to keep everyone occupied until we ordered. We ordered two Wisconsin Samplers for 11.99 a piece. It had TWO of each thing on it! I couldn't even believe it.

For my meal I ordered the pesto flatbread. I had to pick the chicken off because it was so bland and tasted like they just stuck it in the microwave!

Extremely disappointed. Will go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"This place is always a lot of fun, especially during sporting events (naturally, its a sports bar!). Although when there isn't anything going on its still a great place to grab a burger and a beer. Pretty good food and drink prices and they even offer a free shuttle to hockey games! small parking accommodations though."}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times now.  After not having been here in a while, we stopped in last night to see Baby Rocket play.

We discovered the patio for the first time (as that's where the band was playing).  It was an absolute perfect night for it.  There is ample seating; so, even though there were quite a few people there, it didn't feel overly crowded.  The bar chairs were comfortable and we thought the decor was lovely (we especially loved the ceiling fans - So cute!).  There are TVs and even little fireplaces outside, which give it a cozy feel.

Blake was our bartender.  He was polite and attentive and you can tell he enjoys his job: Service with a smile and never let our drinks hit empty before asking if we wanted another one!  He said he was new to the place; so, it was very nice when he asked us questions about ourselves in an effort to get to know us.  We absolutely loved the conversation and would even come back for his excellent service alone!

We had our Bucky Book coupon for a free sandwich.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and my boyfriend got the turkey club.  HOLY SMOKES.  The Club is HUGE.  They use thick-sliced bread.  My boyfriend was in hog heaven.  The fries that came on the side were just meh.  Kinda bland and they weren't super hot.  The chicken sandwich was pretty basic, but what made it was the bun!  It had a little bit of sweetness to it.  Yum.  The chicken was nice and moist (I can't tell you how many times I've had chicken sandwiches that are dried out.  Yuck!). My mom wasn't a fan of the shrimp tacos.  In fact, she advised that people \"stick to the burgers.\"  We saw a couple orders of nachos go by.... They actually looked liked nacho towers because the filled the plate so high with them!  I want to try them next time.

Overall, it was a fantastic night.  The other times we have been here were great, too.  Thanks, Lucky's, for making our Friday night so relaxing!!"}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: a promising pub run poorly.

My friends and I used to practically live at Lucky's. We were as close to being regulars as you could be without working there. The bartenders knew us, the food was good and plentiful, the suds were flowing, and good times were had by all. My, how time changes places.

Lucky's is one of the few bars on Regent that used to openly accept the college scene while still trying to cater to the locals. The place itself is rather large inside, with a hidden back area. There are tons of flat-screen TVs everywhere, with a few games and blaring music. 

The specials used to be great, with dollar corn dogs and beers on Thursdays being my favorite. We knew the bartenders by name and they made good and cheap drinks for us, serving the food quickly. 

At some point, it was like a light switch flipped (a former bartender later told us the owner lost it and started demanding change). Immediately the bartenders were sullen every day, making weak drinks and complaining, yes complaining to a customer, about any request that wasn't \"vodka sprite\" or \"beer\". They went from loving us (we must've spent hundreds of dollars there over the course of one school year) to verbally expressing their frustration with serving us. 

The bar started catering more to the fratty crowds coming from smaller colleges in the area and capitalizing on their drunken tastebuds and open wallets. Some staff left, and the staff that stayed got either lazier or more frazzled. They even lost my friend's credit card one night in their rush. 

I will always have fond memories of the past Lucky's, but I don't plan on returning anymore. It's not a horrible place now, but it fell from such heights."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours for our lunch and it wasn't even busy.  Its a nice bar but horrible food service."}
{"text":"Service was ok, 3 different plastic glass sizes at outside bar for the same beer! The pizza we ordered was very good but burnt on edges and raw in middle. It was consistent  with what we have heard about the pizzas . Apparently they don't know or are not properly trained on cooking with a wood stove. 
We've heard the same about new Lucky's in Okee, just wish they would get the proper cooking down, rumors would stop."}
{"text":"Time to try Luckys again -- had Saturday prime rib and it was good - adjust for this being a sports bar and it was great! Last several visits I can see real improvements in the quality of the food. Fish fry, chicken strips, prime rib and even a steak have been really good. Ok not a Ruth's Chris or wonderbar steak but it was very good for a sports bar."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 15. We thought this place is pretty big, they should be able to accommodate us. Took an hour and half to get our food. I had pizza, which was burnt on the bottom. I felt had it not been burnt it would of been pretty good. 

One person in the group had the tuna steak which was way over cooked.  Very dry and tough. 

The philly was mediocre.  

The fish fry was luke warm, and nothing to write home about. 

The nachos were good from what i heard. 

I will say out waitress was very good and on top of it. Kudos for here."}
{"text":"We play volleyball at Lucky's in Waunakee, which is unfortunate because otherwise I would not go back.  We have literally found nails and glass (along with the rocks) in their sand courts, and the nets are terrible.  The referees show up, but don't actually call any illegal hits, and you can only see the score half the time.  Even the balls are poor quality from being left out and getting water-logged.  

Initially, I would have thought their outdoor patio was nice.  But the firepits are never lit (they are always out of gas), and we have had to move seats because some of the staff won't serve you food if you are sitting near one of the (turned off) fire pits.  The selection of liquors outside is a joke, and the beer always seems too carbonated.  The service outside has also been atrociously slow.  Just 2 weeks ago it took over an hour to get 4 simple sandwich meals and last week it took 20 minutes to get an appetizer!

Inside, the service and alcohol selection has been slightly better.  I would definitely NOT recommend the crab cakes, and the green beans are definitely weird. Three people tried them, and no one could tell why they were so bad (some type of sauce maybe?).  

Once our volleyball season is over, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great fish fry- both the walleye and perch. coleslaw left something to be desired but the rest of the deal was great. Missy, our waitress was special personality who made our visit to this restaurant especially rewarding."}
{"text":"The sign on their doors said they were open for Monday Night Football, but when my wife and I showed up around 7:30pm, their doors were all locked. We could see a few customers inside and a couple people behind the bar. We tried three different doors and no one bothered to make eye contact with us or even tell us whether or not they were closed despite the flashing OPEN sign they had. It was disappointing since this was close to our house and could've been a regular spot to hang out for games."}
{"text":"Came here to watch a Badger game. Good beer choices,  the food was COLD.  Pub chips made in mass earlier, deep brown (overdone) served ice cold (really?  How long to cook chips?  3 min if the grease is hot!). Nachos we ordered were gross.  Canned food service cheese, served cold (really?  Canned cheese in Wisconsin??).  Chips were cold, cheese cold - disgusting.  Our friends arrived, ate a tiny bit and suggested we go elsewhere.  Maybe something else here is good, we were going to order burgers, but decided that after the first two items, we decided a third try was not worth it.  Headed out joking that the name is now \"Yucky's\" to us."}
{"text":"Decided to visit Lucky's last night when my husband and I were in the area, mostly because we wanted to use our Bucky Book coupon. We decided to sit outside on their patio, which was really nice. They have a large bar and seating area by the sand volleyball courts and fire pits, and even have a bag toss area, which we thought was pretty unique. Several patio tables have large, bright umbrellas to help block the sun while dining outside, which is also a nice option to have. There were banners advertising lots of good weekday happy hour specials, which we will try next time. Their menu is pretty extensive, and I enjoyed the variety of wraps they offer. My husband ordered a melt, and I went with the buffalo chicken wrap, and we weren't disappointed. The portions were large and the food was flavorful. Our waiter was very attentive, friendly and accomodating, which we appreciate, as we know good help isn't easy to find. We had a couple questions regarding the menu, our coupon, and our bill, and he was very knowledgable and helpful. We were happy to have found a place with a nice outdoor patio, good food options, and great service, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The worst bartender in town works here!! BEWARE! I believe his name is Daniel? Horrible customer service. I will not return until he no longer works at this establishment. He has a short temper and should not be working in a customer service field. I was at this bar last night and he tried to start something with my boyfriend over a corn dog he order? Which was on their late night menu (this was at 11pm?) apparently he had turned his equipment off and he only got the fries he ordered...my boyfriend questioned where his corn dog was? and the bartender goes \"COME HERE! COME HERE! (takes him aside) You wanna start something?\" Minutes before this happened I took a seat at the bar to play photo hunt, I was sitting next to an acquaintance and said \"oh I'm gonna come sit next to you\" and quickly say \"just kidding, I'm gonna play photo hunt, you wanna play?\" The bartender blurts in, \"Why would you wanna be with that douchbag?\" I thought he was kidding, I really thought he liked my boyfriend as the last time we were in that bar, he (the bartender) was talking to for quite a while. I only had one drink and the two guys I was with each had two beer. Nobody was drunk or acting up? He literally freaked out over a CORN DOG. We were all confused and talking at our table like WTF? and the table next to us said, yeah he just cut us off so were leaving and we're not even drunk. I worked in a bar for quite some time and this group was fine. They were drinking, playing games and really not even being loud. He told my boyfriend to leave in front of the whole bar while he was sitting eating his fries with me. He then told our friends at the bar \"he doesn't know what it is, but my boyfriends face makes him want to punch him.\" Pretty strange guy, somethings loose in his head. TOTALLY unexpected and TOTALLY miss treated, my boyfriend has been going to this bar for over 6 years and was friends with the previous owner, but he refuses to return until this guy is GONE!"}
{"text":"Good drink prices, nice selection of beers, solid sports bar.  Plenty of room for a big party to go watch a game. Great prices and good food. Nice assortment of Waunakee folks, if that's not a contradiction. The specials each night are great, including the pizza on Saturday.  Bartenders remember us, and are nice. Easy parking."}
{"text":"Knew this place opened a bit back, and stopped here for lunch a couple of months ago.  Meal was adequate.
As the first stop on out summer Saturday dinner trek, and since we enjoy Lucky's on Regent, we found our way here, and wished we hadn't.
Sports bar in Waunakee, on a slow sports night.
Typical sports bar fare.  Nothing special.  I had the warrior burger and spouse had the chicken caesar salad.
Not great and not awful, but no different than all the other places like this and was missing the general buzz and ambience of the Lucky's on Regent.
Doubtful would return, but given their only uniqueness is the wood fired pizza, would have to try that."}
{"text":"The Rueben is to die for.  So good.   I've consistently had GREAT service as well.  Not sure why negative experiences, but for the last 9months, I've had only good experiences."}
{"text":"I guess \"Open for Monday Night Football\" means we're locking ALL our doors at 7:30 pm and not acknowledge potential customers trying to open them. 

Even customers that recently left and saw us try to get in were surprised that the doors were locked. Maybe turn off the OPEN sign if you're not going to let customers in during supposed business hours."}
{"text":"The service absolutely sucks.  Asked for iced tea and was told they only had lemonade which turned out to be complete BS.  Sad because could be a great place.  Oh yeah, as far as food goes it's the 7th best burger in Waunakee"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  By far the best bar food I have ever had.  The sliders really rock.  The bartenders were really friendly and there was a TV everywhere you looked"}
{"text":"We stage our Thursday night cycling club rides out of Lucky's, so this is a weekly destination for me during cycling season.  Aside from being a good location for this purpose, Lucky's is a great place to refuel and hang out after a ride.  We really like the expansive outdoor seating and they've always got plenty of space for us.  

Lucky's has a solid tap list, with all of the styles covered by good local, regional, and farther-flung beers with some cool surprises now and then.  

The menu is what I would call a pretty expansive bar repertoire, with a nice variety of burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, and entrees, and a really good list of appetizers.  I can vouch for the burgers; and one of my favorite things is the Papas Grande appetizer, which I get as a meal - waffle fries with cheese sauce, seasoned ground beef, tomatoes, jalapenos, onions, all the toppings of nachos.  This is one of my guilty pleasures and something I look forward to all week!

The waitstaff at Lucky's is friendly and engaging, but I wish they had few more of these nice people.  It gets busy (Lucky's also has two sand volleyball courts, indoor & outdoor bars, and lots of tables), and it can take quite a while to get a drink.  I've seen some cases where many of us would have had another round, had the service been quicker.  Reading some other reviews, this seems consistent, and I'd wager an extra server or two would really pay off for Lucky's, and would make for happier customers and more return visits.  (And more stars on Yelp!)."}
{"text":"This is a sports bar with many nice TVs.  Unfortunately, there is only one audio feed played throughout the bar.  When we went there was only 1 cook 1 bartender for 30 people.  They did their best, but service was slow.  The food is good."}
{"text":"Poor experience at Luckys tonight. We got there at 755 and wanted to order food. The bartender was rude and said \"you better order food fast then\" and walked away. We ordered nachos for two people. The nachos were VERY stale. When we got our bill, we were charged for the large size nachos vs the regular ones. (menu says large serves 5-10 people). Why would they give us an app for two people that serves 5-10!!? Drinks were also very watered down and service was very poor. Bartender acted like she had a bad day and just wanted us to leave. We are Waunakee natives and have been here many times without bad experience but tonight threw us off and we likely will not be returning."}
{"text":"You're better off walking a couple blocks East and going to Jordan's.  Way better sports bar atmosphere, better deals, more bar games and waaaaaay better food.  Lucky's is a sad shell of the former Oakcrest, which was always a favorite in the neighborhood.  There is the occasional good drink special and the food can be hit or miss.  All the stadium area bars have their niche, but I can't name one thing that Lucky's does really well.  Yet, even though I don't have anything good to say I can't really badmouth it too much either. It is just kinda bland, boring and wholly mediocre."}
{"text":"Don't eat the ribeye steak sandwich. Went in yesterday ate it and have been super sick ever since. Tasted funny I should have known."}
{"text":"Great big bar. They have a bull on certain nights, which can provide some entertainment. The drinks are reasonably priced and the waitresses/bartenders are hot! Yay college town!"}
{"text":"Just came here to watch some march madness games on a Saturday. There were a lot of families and groups of guys, so the crowd isn't your typical college crowd.

There's TVs everywhere and the staff are very accommodating if you want to change the channel. 

The food is fairly good/ standard bar food. We got cheese curds and the papa grande, which is basically a nacho platter but with waffle fries. I guess the food was good for the purpose it serves, but wasn't out standing."}
{"text":"In the past, I have only stopped in to Lucky's on a Badger football Saturday.  In the past few weeks, I have stopped in a few times for a bite to eat and a drink. Foodwise, the menu is pretty standard bar fare.  Some appetizers, burgers, wraps with daily specials.  Tip of the hat that they use Knoche's meat for their burgers.  While I am not blown away by the food, everything that I tried has been solid and priced reasonably.  On the beer side, expect to see your typical macrobrews (Bud, Miller, Coors, etc) but they do have some local (and some nonlocal) craft brews.  The staff are always pleasant and welcoming.  Pair that with a good burger and a cold beer and you got yourself a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Tried it on a home football Saturday. 
About 25 folks in the place  half at the bar and  1 bartender.
Painfully slow service - unless you're  regular it seems - and then it's the fake friendly work you for the tip variety. 
Burger was damn good - good sized cooked as ordered with cheese and bacon a plenty on fresh roll. 
Local folks and place  just not very friendly.
Too bad; food was good."}
{"text":"The one reason I am giving this for stars is because of one worker is name is Jeremy he's a bartender and he works harder than anybody else in that whole entire establishment he always make sure that my order is correct and that it is brought out just how I asked for it. The prime rib is to die for eight is the best prime rib in Lodi. This year they started having outside a grill where you could get jerk chicken kebabs and shrimp kebabs and that was an absolute wonderful idea."}
{"text":"Love that place, great tap beer, food and interior."}
{"text":"Pretty typical sports bar...def recommend their nachos."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Understaffed. We were there on a Saturday at 1:30and no one acknowledged us at the hostess station. ..moved to the bar....not even a nod or smile from the bartender. ...WE LEFT."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Really good craft beer tap selection. The Old Chub Nitro really hit the spot. Food was really good both times. Today had the chicken bacon ranch pasta and that was really tasty, along with the cheesy broccoli soup. Yum! My 14-year-old son had a bacon cheeseburger and he said it was really good. There are so many TVs, too! Great place to come watch a game."}
{"text":"Lunch was okay. When ordering a burger for $8 to $9 they charge $1.75 extra for a modest handful of mediocre fries. Ala carte pricing for a basic burger basket felt like nickel-and-dime-ing the customer. Nice space. Sports bar area is quite large and no shortage TVs. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"The search for the next great Waunakee dining spot continues...

As a hungry denizen of the only Waunakee in the World, I'm constantly on the lookout for a passable dining option in our fair burg.  That increasingly futile search brought me to Lucky's the other day for lunch.

Inside, it's your basic sports-themed bar and grill, with a lots of of Waunakee sports memorabilia on the walls.  If you are looking for a beer and a place to watch a game, you are in luck since the beer selection is pretty good and there are TVs throughout the facility.

The menu follows the basic sports bar formula, with lots of deep fried appetizers, burgers, wraps and sandwiches.  I tried the cheese curds, which were too greasy and were served with a bland ranch dressing.  My entree was the corned beef Reuben sandwich served on a marble rye.  They were a little skimpy on the meat and there was too much 1000 island dressing, which soaked through the bread and made it the sandwich difficult to eat.  There was no crunch to the toast, so the texture of the meal was very unappealing.  Frankly, I've had a better Rueben at Culver's and paid a lot less for it there.

The service was mediocre as well.  Our waitress showed up within a couple of minutes to get our drink order, but it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks and for her to take our lunch order even though there were only about a half dozen other diners eating lunch.  After the food arrived at our table, she did not check in to see how we were doing when we could have used a refill on our drinks.  When I flagged her down to get our check, it took another 10 minutes for the bill to arrive.

The other annoyance were the flies that seemed to like my sandwich more than I did.  The staff were not proactive in dealing with this problem.

So sadly, my search for that perfect bite in Waunakee continues as I can not recommend Lucky's until they upgrade their menu and their service staff."}
{"text":"An update - Was in yesterday for lunch and had some quesadillas with pork, and they were outstanding.  Try them!"}
{"text":"We squeezed into Lucky's Bar & Grille's beer garden after the Badger's homecoming win against Minnesota.
Very busy place, filled to max!  Many heavy celebrators, but no obnoxious drunks!  It was a fun time!  Great place to celebrate!   It would have been nice to see what the inside of Lucky's was like, but perhaps on another trip to Madison on a non-football weekend!"}
{"text":"This is one of many \"sports\" bars near the stadium.... and near my home.  

I usually end up here not for the sports aspect, but for the near-home aspect.  My meterology roommate is to blame;  he drags me here for tempting reasons such as \"one beer!\"  or \"It's weather-man appreciation day.\"  How can I say no?   (He fancies the bar because there is always one television showing the weather channel).

It's easy enough to carve away some space, if no where else than at the sidewalk-window.  I can get by.  .. and enjoy some great conversation about what precipitation probability means.

Anyway, I'm getting at a point here.  The point is, while the conversation is pretty geekishly delicious, the beer never is.  It's always off.  I coulda sworn the Stella Artoise was switched for bud light.  The next visit the Newcastle was weak and smelled like sour socks.  

Is lucky's getting old kegs or treating them in the sun?  I don't like their funk beer.  2 stars."}
{"text":"We stopped at this location as the parking lot at Lucky's on the Lake was packed. The parking lot was mostly empty, save for a fairly large group of bikers.
The bartender, server, and cook all seemed pleasant. The beer selection was good.
We were told that our first choice of appetizer (the bacon balls) was no longer available.
The mac & cheese bites were decent. However, the burgers and fries were not very good. Bland dry beef and crushed pepper on the fries were terrible. But the bonus was later, when we both spent most of the remainder of the day in the bathroom.
If the food is similar to that of their Okee location, then I'm glad we didn't waste the time waiting for a parking spot to open up at there."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio. Great experience until I ordered food ( luckily I was ignored the first 2 hours I was here & got my own drinks!). The nachos were tortilla chips  with a little cheese sauce, a cut up hamburger & 3 little tomato slices. The pretzels were hard as a rock & everything was ice cold. Manager apologized for the food & bought a drink for the one male in our group, ignored the two females with an empty glass sitting in front of us. Finally called the manager over, explained our issues & his exact words \"Sorry I suck at customer service\", he then got up & walked away from out table. I will never be back!!"}
{"text":"Lucky's is your quintessential sports bar & grill. Nothing on the menu will blow your socks off but that's ok. Solid wings, frys, burgers, and pizzas. When I'm going to watch a game or play bar games that's cool with me. 

Great set up for the TVs in the bar. No weird sight lines or having to me \"that guy\" begging to have a TV switched over. 

Friendly staff however both the Waunakee and Madison locations feel grossly understaffed on Badger game days. 

Pro tip - ride the fan bus from Waunakee to Madison for games!"}
{"text":"Home of a surprisingly good fish fry on Friday nights. No wait, cheap prices and attentive staff. 

Other than Friday's? There's better bar food."}
{"text":"Been here a few more times since my last review. As I always say I'm really happy that this place is even an option in Waunakee, which has an almost total dearth of retail and restaurants.

Service has always been great each time I've visited.

That said, the quality of the food has been mixed as of late. I did get a rubbery chicken sandwich one time that still gives me nightmares. The pizza is just not my style and I didn't enjoy it. Burgers and wings are pretty good (I would stick with these). Pretzels are good too."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a higher rating and parts of it scored, but too many did not.  We came between 4:30 and 5 on a Friday.  Typically I'm used to places being busy Friday afternoons and that's why we brought the kids early.  It was very quiet and there were three servers waiting at the hostess station, so seating was immediate.

Insert first issue.  The kids menus were already colored on.  Our server was wonderful and immediately corrected this and apologized and brought us fresh ones.  I question how clean clearing is if used kids menus end up mixed with the new ones...

Menus:  we tried ordering an appetizer we wanted to try.  They, of course, are out.  At 5 pm on  Friday night.  Server apologized and offered suggestions, but none were unbreaded and we try to give our gluten-free kiddo the option to try.  So, no appetizer.  However, kudos because when I asked if it was an option to do grilled chicken tenders on the kid's menu-(unspecified) they catered to that.  I'm pretty sure the fries had some batter mixed in, so do not expect those to be gluten-free.

I had the fish fry special which I ordered with fries and the server said it also came with soup or salad.  AKA both.  So I added a salad.  When our food arrived I was without the fries.  When I questioned the person bringing the food she said it was either or.  Again, I wasn't in the mood to argue, but our server said it was with both and brought the fries that my daughter devoured.  So, very polite and fixed problem once again. Our server was clearly on her A game.

Then our last issue where I drew the line was when I took my two daughters to the outside bathrooms.  I get this is an outside bar, I get that volleyball players use it so I can get past the fact that there's sand on the floor and bugs in the sink.  But there was no soap.  So after hauling the diaper wipes out to wash our hands I paused at the outdoor bar to let the bartender know so she could let some other staff member change it.  I waited until she stopped chatting with the customers sitting there; they acknowledged we were there.  I said \"just so you know, the ladies restroom has no soap (and if employees need to wash their hands...not to mention the customers that want to).  She muttered ok and went back to her conversation.  I did let the hostess know who actually did care (kudos).

So, Lucky's I want to give you another chance.  Your food was ok, but this visit really was a meh.  But a few of your staff members were great and I'm assuming my husband gave our server a good tip as she deserved it."}
{"text":"Not going back.  Tried Lucky's five or six times.  Always bad service and disappointing food.  Huge facility."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in there on Saturday at 3:30 PM. The bar only had A couple of people sitting in it and the outside area had a few parents watching girls playing volleyball. We sat outside and waited for service for about 10 minutes. I then walked inside to the bar and attempted to get service while the two girls just stared at the cash register. I sat inside for five minutes while watching golf and gave up and went back outside. Then shortly after getting back outside a hostess took our drink order (whiskey coke, bloody Mary and one beer). It was 20 minutes later and I decided to go inside to see what the statuses was with the drinks. The waitress said she was getting it so I went back outside. The waitress came back outside with my beer and we had to wait for the mixed drink and Bloody Mary. Once we received our drinks I determined it would be best to finish those and leave. I was shocked when I saw the bill. $8 for the whiskey Coke. $7 for the Bloody Mary. These were in small plastic little cups! 

On the plus side the Nachos looked very good.

This was my third visit to this establishment. I'm not coming back."}
