{"text":"Breakfast and Lunch - this restaurant is fantastic. Reasonable prices, and a fast service. And the biscuits that they serve with most meals are the size of a hand. And that can be a meal into itself. When I'm back in Phoenix, I will come back."}
{"text":"Was one of our favorite places to eat. Til a month ago  While having breakfast waitress walked by dropped mustard splattered all over me she just simply walked away without a word busboy came to clean up I went to the bathroom to try to wash up it didn't work when I came out Ronda was standing there and never said a word to me I was very disappointed in that so I called the manager when I got home he told me you'd heard about it but again Rondo or Mike never call me back to just say I'm sorry"}
{"text":"First I want everyone to know that this restaurant  does not operate a buffet, all orders are prepared fresh. We had breakfast here on Sunday morning before Memorial Day 2013 there was a waiting line when we arrived but we waited less than 20 minutes before we were seated. They have two large dining rooms and have bar seating. We had great service and outstanding food. When in this area again we sure would eat here. The five stars really means as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Biggest and freshest biscuits I have ever had. The staff is speedy yet friendly and the cost is perfect. I still can't get over the great portion size."}
{"text":"Good good and large portions. The biscuits & gravy was some of the best I've ever had.  Service was prompt & cheerful.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. Service was fantastic food came out quick and was hot. Can't find a single negative thing to say"}
{"text":"The Place is not perfect, but is solid for what it is. It used to East of 51st Ave a few years ago, but has since moved West of 51st to put it right on Bell Road.   It's kind of a greasy spoon without the typical diner feel. Love the pancakes and French toast."}
{"text":"This place used to be a really crappy mexican food place. Its disappearance alone was a blessing. So when i saw it was replaced by The Place i decided i would try it. The first 2 times i went we had to wait out front but for no more than around 15 minutes. My 3rd visit we got right in. Each time i have had the eggs benedict and a side of their thick cut bacon. I give the food and service an above average. You get a lot of food for a very reasonable price. I don't live in the area, but when i am around there, i generally stop for breakfast."}
{"text":"Very good, I always have had breakfast here but just had a very good lunch. This location is much larger that the old one across the street .   I do think the breakfasts are their strongest"}
{"text":"I guess I do not agree with the majority.  I found the food to be average at best.  And the prices seemed high for the quality of food.  All in all, I would have been happier at a Coco's or Denny's.  I will head a little south to Peoria and go to Brother's."}
{"text":"The staff was excellent.  I had the hungryman breakfast.  The portion was very generous and a good value.  The menu wasn't fancy but just right for a breakfast joint.  This place makes you feel welcome and that was what I was looking for.  The food comes out fast."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. I wanted something different than our usual Sunday Family breakfast. I did not expect such awesomeness.  ~Minimal wait for a busy Sunday.  ~Greeting and seating was nice, followed quickly by our drink order.  ~Josh, our waiter, was knowledgeable, and on point. Friendly, fun and a bit of sassy.  ~Food? Indescribable greatness. VERY reasonable pricing and quantity was awesome.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hash browns were plain and totally unseasoned, and the biscuits & gravy were dreadful! Gravy was runny, under seasoned, and obvious no sausage was used...very cheap. The biscuits weren't really biscuits; no flaky layers, or buttery taste, it was an oversized dinner roll...nothing more. Overall breakfast was disappointing."}
{"text":"Busy place on a Sunday morning, and the staff was more attentive to the old farts seated at the bar, probably because they knew those guys would be washing down their football and eggs with plenty of beer - higher tabs. The menu offers enough variation to keep you coming back but doesn't set you up for analysis paralysis. My breakfast was okay - I didn't care for the charred taste of the sausage patties but the over-medium eggs were cooked right and the biscuit was tender."}
{"text":"Yelp cuts off my extensive reviews, please check out the full reviews (with photos) here:  http://bit.ly/hsdQOc  The Food: The Place serves some of the biggest portions of breakfast food I have ever seen.  The quality of the food is always average to above average.  It's nothing amazing - not even consistently excellent quality similar to somewhere like Mimi's Café.  The portions definitely make up for that.  I usually order the same thing:  Meat and Eggs, which all consists of the following:      * 2 Strips of maple smoked bacon     * 2 eggs prepared to order     * A pile of potatoes     * 2 buttermilk pancakes     * One cup of EPIC coffee  The bacon is very good.  Tasty, sweet with hints of maple and savory thick pieces of delicious bacon.  Very rarely burned, and never undercooked.  The eggs are decent, prepared to order (I like mine scrambled rough) and the potatoes are actually surprisingly tasty, crispy and have a spice to them.  The pancakes are ridiculous.  They are almost the size of hubcaps...sometimes they are too big.  It's hard to get the butter spread evenly on them because they are so big and thick!  The pancakes are served with two types of syrup:  Maple and Blueberry.   The problem with such a bountiful feast is that I usually can't finish all of this so I am forced to start picking and choosing like a selective fat pigeon, and I usually just giving up on everything.  One thing I wanted to take a special moment to mention is the coffee.  Usually I don't find it necessary to showcase a specific drink (unless it's exceptional) and believe me when I say, this coffee is...epic.  It's +50 to all stats, no doubt.   I one time asked our server what the coffee (brand) is, so that I could procure it for my own sinister intentions but I was told that it is sold only in 5lb bags and is some sort of unusual brand flavor.  I want to say it is called \"Royale\" by Sara Lee, diner brand or something...but don't quote me on that.  I was appreciative of the server telling me the brand and everything but I started to think to myself:  If I had access to this amazing coffee ALL the time, it would make going to The Place less special.  My wife orders almost exclusively the French Toast with extra powdered sugar and a side of hash browns.  I have had the pleasure of trying both her hash browns and her French toast and I find them both to be very good for the value.  The hash browns are crispy and delicious, served on a plate the size of a brick.   The French Toast comes in a giant pile of 6 pieces (what is that, half a loaf?) and has never been too soggy or undercooked."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best breakfast /brunch places that I have ever been to! The food is amazing and there coffee tastes really good ! Not too strong and not too light , just perfect ! The waiters and waitresses are pretty efficient at there job. There was a couple of times when I had a waiter that was a little slow at checking in , but thats usually only when they're pretty busy ! Overall this is an awesome place to take a date or the family!"}
{"text":"First time.  The food was great!  Huge portion size and still decent prices. Our server Kim and the rest of the staff did and excellent job.  I like the fact that whenever a server walks by they top of your coffee. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"They have moved to West Bell Rd ( into the old 3 Margarita 's ) They now serve dinner, and have a full bar. The new location is really nice and a lot bigger. It is still packed, maybe even busier than before. Thye still do the best home cooked breakfast. Dinner is steak, chops,etc."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. When you drive up and see all the people standing there you are and you think you are in for a long wait but not really. It is really big inside and you can get seated pretty quickly. Also you can sit at the bar and eat if you don't want to wait and you have just a couple of people. Staff is very friendly and the food comes out really hot and very quick. The portions are huge and delicious. My husband loves the green salsa that you can get with your eggs and also that you can get tortillas instead of bread. The biscuits are huge."}
{"text":"I was visiting some friends in Arizona for the weekend and after two nights of partying we needed a huge meal to soak up the alcohol that was seeping through our pores. My friend suggested going to The Place, I gave the thumbs up based solely on the name.   We arrived on a Sunday around 10 AM to a crowd gathering outside the door and around the restaurant. Astonishingly the wait was only about 20 mins so we decided to wait it out instead of going elsewhere.   We all got breakfast platters and gorged once they came out. Their portion sizes are Merican as I like to say and was much needed at the time. I could not finish my meal which was sad but did enjoy all the food I got and the dirt cheap price tag it came on. If only LA and NYC had food this cheap -_-"}
{"text":"Perfect for breakfast (but probably good for any meal). The biscuits and gravy was so good! The biscuits are enormous, fluffy and moist. The bacon is very flavorful and cooked just right. This place really is The Place! Haha."}
{"text":"Good food choices, reasonably priced.  We were seated, served and received food hot and promptly.  Dining area and restrooms, nice and clean.  Staff was great.  Can't wait to return and try the breakfast."}
{"text":"So after hearing only god things about the place I decided to check it out and see what all the hub bub was about.needless to say,I was very disapointed.we went in around 2pm on a Tuesday.it was not very busy which I like.the less than friendly host/server seated us promptly at a table with dried ketchup stains on it.really??.we asked to move to another table and she obliged but proceeded to give me a dirty look.I know they're famous for their breakfast but I was in the mood for a salad so I ordered the grilled chicken salad.my friend ordered the hungry man breakfast.when I got my salad it looked like something you'd buy at the grocery store in a bag.it was cheap old looking lettuce that was soaking wet.there was barely any chicken in it.and what little chicken I got was stringy and fatty.also the dressing looked and tasted expired.my friend said her breakfast was o.k. but nothing special.when the server asked how the food was I said not very good and explained why.she offered another salad but I declined due to loss of appetite.she didn't even tell a manager or anything.which I don't really mind anyhow.especially because what appeared to be the manager,or should I say,\"micro manager\" was too  busy loudly berating one of the employees in front of everyone for what appeared to be just asking a simple question about procedure.very unprofessional.the whole atmosphere inside was unprofessional.the servers look like trailor trash covered in tacky tattoos which some love to show off by cutting off the sleeves of their uniform.now I like tattoos and have some but don't go out of my way to show them off.especially while working with the public.also even though it wasn't busy the server made us feel rushed like we were a bother and dropped our check off while my friend was still eating.then when we were ready to pay we waited almost 15 minutes for no sleeves mcgee to take payment.wtf?bottom line is that the service was awful the food was big in portion size but lacking in quality . I really don't see why everyone loves this place.maybe the breakfast is better?not sure all  I know is I won't be back.if I wanted to be looked down upon by trailor trash i'd move to alabama."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. They have defiantly stepped up their game since they have come down from flagstaff. Friendly people work there. Locally owned/ operated by a family of four. (Nicest people ever.) Great food. Great people. Great prices. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Been to this place quite a few times for breakfast. The food and service were excellent. Sometimes on weekends there is a short wait but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. If you frozen food (except the eggs) heated up, boxed pancakes and waffles. This is the place for you. Save a few dollars and go to Denny's or IHOP  Service Good, and Fast only reason I gave it 2 stars."}
{"text":"We love to come here regularly. The food is great and always plenty of service. My one concern is that the carbonation in the soda is always flat. When we asked the staff, they were aware of it but nothing has changed to fix it."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've ever had ! Fast service when seated very busy weekends ! I recommend u get tha app no wait !"}
{"text":"The breakfast is great but my husband and I usually go for the Friday night fish fry or the Sat night prime rib special...both are excellent! Have been there many times and have had awesome service every time. The larger restaurant is nice...you can have a conversation without yelling or listening to someone else. We love The Place!"}
{"text":"We love it here, have been here around 15 times and never had a bad meal or bad service and Crystal makes THE BEST micheladas!! Whenever we have family visiting from out of town we make it a point to bring them here."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and the quantity is filling. The servers are very helpful and definitely work as a team. It's only breakfast and lunch so it's always busy I recommend getting here early"}
{"text":"Went in on a Thursday morning was pleasantly surprise at how packed it was. Had a few mimosas ( perfect mix of juice and sparkling wine) had a burger medium which was excellent. Service was awesome as well."}
{"text":"The Place has the best multi grain pancakes I've ever eaten.  I always order, 2 eggs, 2 patties, & hash browns. The pancakes cover your plate, they are huge.  The eggs are always cooked to your liking and very delicious.  The sausage patties are big and tasty as well as their thick crispy bacon.  The place is always very clean and they pride themselves in that.  I also love their hash browns.  I always take home half my meal and frequent this restaurant on a monthly basis.  I strongly recommend you try it.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously the best. There's always a wait but it's well worth it. Very budget friendly and you get absolutely delicious food."}
{"text":"Saturday mid morning, the PLACE was busy. Got stuffed by pancakes that were delicious and huge. Everything was fresh and hot. Service was very good,thanks Jackie. Nice and clean,good atmosphere. TV' s,Wi-Fi and a bar were a plus. Will revisit."}
{"text":"I've gotta start by saying that this place is not fancy. It's a simple down home restraunt. The food is your everyday breakfast food done right. Just like mom would cook. The prices are very fair and the portions are enough to fill anyone. The pancakes are just what a pancake should be. Fluffy and tasty. If you come here make sure to get biscuts and gravy. The rolls and biscuts are huge. Come hungrey and don't expect white table cloths and French waiters. They close at three so get down there soon! Chase out"}
{"text":"Bacon is awesome. Rolls are huge. Rest of the breakfast menu is average. Friendly service. Good solid spot."}
{"text":"Had an amazing and very filling brunch for two for 11 dollars! Seriously great service, loud and very packed yet roomy atmosphere, and delicious food.  I will be going here again!"}
{"text":"We loved the \"Mike & Ronda's\" In Flag and the one at 51st ave and Bell is just as good. Best diner breakfast in town. The prices are great also. Try the Hungryman."}
{"text":"Went FINALLY for the first time after all these wonderful reviews.....   Eh. It was just breakfast to me. We'll probably never go back. I left with a super upset stomach, too. Yuck."}
{"text":"We went to \"THE PLACE\" for breakfast/lunch today. It must be a popular spot and was very busy. There were 2 specials of the day, Eggs Benedict and a French Toast stack. Both came with a choice of potatoes. I went here based on the reviews from fellow Yelpers.  My daughter ordered the burger, it came with fries AND salad for under 7.00. The burger was very well done, but it was 1/2 lb of ground beef. The fixings were on the side and it arrived on an unremarkable hamburger bun. The fries were crisp and the salad was fine but it was DRENCHED in a watered down thousand island dressing. My eggs benedict was fine. Nothing to make me want to order it again, but not bad either. I would try their pancakes next time. They looked pretty good! My husband's french toast stack arrived. 3 pieces of french toast with ham,egg and swiss cheese between the layers. Kinda like a Monte Cristo sandwich. They bring out warm maple and berry syrup. My husband liked it. But, said he would try something else next time. I ordered my hashbrowns extra crispy, my husband ordered his \"burnt\", his order came out exactly how i wanted mine. Crispy dark golden and cooked well. Bummer I had to just eat the top of mine. We also wanted to try the biscuits and gravy. What a big let down. Quantity does not equal quality. The biscuits were large, and the gravy bland. Our service was ok. The people working there seem nice enough. They were giving out free THE PLACE frisbees. They will be closing 7/21 and will re open 8/1 at the new location right up the street at 51st ave and Bell rd, in the old 3 Margaritas building. Hopefully I will be able to update this one day and give a better rating.  But for now, I will stick to Ronnie's Cafe on Cactus rd. as my go to breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Always a great breakfast spot. Gets 4 stars because you get a cranky server every once in a while but not often."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a good home cooked breakfast. Portions are more than satisfying. Highly recommend the corned beef hash."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak is so good, I swear they kidnapped someone's southern grandma and are keeping her in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with a friend and was pleased with the experience for the most part. The service was really great as were the portion sizes. Everything was very tasty and seemed to be fresh.  I'm giving only 4 stars because my eggs were not made as I ordered them. Also oddly enough they don't serve the biscuits with the gravy on them and the small cup of gravy was not even close to being enough to cover the massive biscuit.  Aside from those two things it was a great experience and I will try them again. Keep in mind that if you go on a weekend you'll be waiting a bit."}
{"text":"First time here, awesome breakfast and the service was great. Well worth the trip. Thanks to our server Dave for making us feel at home."}
{"text":"Won't be back. Food was only fair. Gravy appears to be from a mix, no flavor, and the sausage patty reminded me of what you get at a fast food place, only much greasier. While the hashbrowns were plentiful, they were only crisp on one side. Coffee was on the weak side and quickly became lukewarm. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here w/a desire to support local business. Wow, am I glad we did!  Service is top notch, menu filled w/home cooking favorites, fresh products used, staff never let drinks get low, plates promptly & kindly removed. Open 6-3. I had a cheese omelette, hash browns, biscuits & gravy, & coffee/water. Fresh not frozen hash browns, fresh biscuits & gravy: nothing frozen & reheated. That was 7$! Will return & my new favorite breakfast place!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap. Fast. Hearty. I am not a fan of the meal 'breakfast', but my brother and father love this place. You get so much food, for such a resonable price. Their breakfast burritos are amazing. You can mix and match any of their fillings. I like mine with cheddar, sausage, avacado, mushrooms and green chiles. Yummy!  The pancakes and biscuits and gravy are HUGE. Like I am not kidding, this place will fill you up & keep you full for 10 days. If you can finish an entire meal, you should win an award. Seriously."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a while and when my friend suggested it, I thought, great way to get out of doing my work.  So we went.  I was uber hungry having just recovered from a stomach virus and not having eaten anything substantial in several days.  I ordered the 2 eggs special, with toasted english muffin, hash browns, and 2 sunny side up eggs.  It was really, really good.  Or possibly, I had low blood sugar and that is why the meal seemed so miraculous.  It tasted perfect and was the perfect amount. Simple food but done well.   I liked the friendly, unpretentious atmosphere.  My companion in playing hooky from our responsibilities ordered the same as I did except with pancakes.  She put the eggs on top of the pancakes, smothered it all in syrup, and ate the eggs with the pancakes.  She said it was good and it did look fantastic.  The price was awesome and the service was quick.  I'll be back to try something else and see if the 5 stars hold up."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised after reading the bad reviews. Arrived at 7AM were seated and served coffee by 7:05 AM. Wait staff was polite and attentive. We did not order right away and did not feel pressured to do so. Once ordered, the food arrived shortly there after and was decent. The price was a little more that I expected. My friend had biscuits and gravy, I had two eggs with diced potatoes and pancakes. Overall, the food was good and the service friendly and prompt.   I would go back."}
{"text":"I love breakfast. It's the best meal of the day. With that said, The Place are the masters of breakfast!  The best way to describe this restaurant is your run of the mill mom and pop establishment...ON STEROIDS!  Since they moved down the street to a larger location, I have been there on several occasions and I'm never disappointed. Recently I ordered the hungry man special. This meal comes with 3 eggs, a huge order of hash browns, 3 strips of bacon, and 3 HUGE biscuits with gravy.  Everything tasted awesome, but the bacon really stood out among the rest.  This isn't your normal bacon. It's more like a bacon steak. It's very thick cut and tastes like heaven.  If you don't try anything else there, try the bacon and you will be hooked for life.  The service here is among the best.  The wait staff is amazing.  They paid attention and kept my ginormous drink filled.  Food prices were very reasonable. My bill came out to about $12 for the meal I described above.  This is \"The Place\" to be!!!"}
{"text":"We've wanted to try this place ever since we saw the long lines it generates on weekends. I had high expectations given the amount of time people were willing to wait in line on a Sunday morning and The Place did not disappoint. My husband and I stopped in for breakfast this morning and we loved it. It's a big restaurant, but casual and comfortable. Service was friendly and prompt. I ordered the build your own omelette. They offer a wide variety of ingredients to include and the chorizo, cheddar, green chile, avocado, sour cream combination I picked was delicious. The omelette itself was huge and it came with hash browns and a choice of biscuits and gravy, toast, pancakes or tortilla--more than I could eat at a very reasonable price. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Flys everyywhere while im trying to eat! Its soo gross!!!!! Food is average! Its nothing special! I wouldnt go back"}
{"text":"Well let's start with the ambiance perfect for a breakfast and lunch place. Service can't speak for all but Daniel was great. Clean bathrooms. OK now for the food I ordered the Eggs Benedict and hash browns both were excellent and wife had eggs and french toast with ham. The ham was a nice size and tasted great. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here and have to say I expected better food. I had an Arizona omelet (western) with hash browns and toast.  Portion size is not the problem however quality and cost is.  Let us start with the hash browns. Horrible pile of mushy potatoes. It was obvious to me they use packaged frozen bags of potatoes.  The toast had so much melted butter that after 1piece my fingers were covered with butter. While the omelet was alright it was nothing special  and is just as good in places like Dennys. Has browns at Dennys is certainly better.  I love the layout of the seating and the wood floors but the food is nothing to write home and in the case of hash browns just plain terrible. With ice tea meal came to $11.40. Could have gotten this meal many other places for less with better hash browns. I would rather have smaller portions of quality food than large portions of in-editable food."}
{"text":"My parents love this place and I cannot fathom why. This place always has long lines and again, no clue why. Large portions but food that is honestly the worst I've tried. First time I went there I ordered biscuits and gravy, both tasted only of raw flour and were inedible. Second time, simple pancakes and bacon. The bacon was burnt and had to be replaced and the pancakes were gluey and tough. But the portions are massive which I'm guessing is their main appeal."}
{"text":"Although the food was the quality of any local diner, I found the staff to be very customer service oriented and that goes a long way. I won't be a regular but am grateful for the service my party and I received."}
{"text":"went midweek and were seated right away  Table was clean, service was adequate but food, meh. Hasbrowns barely cooked and no flavor and the famous biscuits were more like mini loaves of bread with no biscuit consistency and the gravy was honestly just blah.  After hearing such rave reviews I had to try it once but don't need to go back.  Kinda sad because I love breakfast."}
{"text":"My husband got a Reuben sandwich, which was excellent. And I got the AZ omlett with hashbrowns and pancakes. All were excellent! Quick food, great service. Recommended."}
{"text":"I have only been to this restaurant 3 times and have received extremely exceptional service every time!! I am an assistant manager for a retail store and know the value of good customer service. The Place has it! I really wish I could remember the young man that waited on myself and my daughter when I took her there a month ago for our Mother-Daughter date! I believe his name was Josh but I could be way off. Anyway he truly impressed me with how attentive he was. He smiled the whole time and made sure we were taken care of in a timely manner. The main thing that impressed me with \"Josh\" was his focus on my daughters happiness. Violet is 4 and he made sure to treat her just like the princess she is! At one point, she decided she wanted some pickles. Seconds later, Josh was at the table. I didn't notice but he told me Violet had waved him over. lol That just goes to show he was watching out for us and was ready when we needed him!   This week on Tuesday,, I needed a Mother-Daughter date myself so I took my Mom to The Place. We were greeted by the most delightful young lady named Tiffany who I found holding the door open for my elderly Mother when I got to the door from parking the car. Once we got inside and Tiffany showed us to our table, we thought we should visit the restroom before sitting. Seeing that my Mom doesn't walk so well, Tiffany immediately says that she would re-seat us closer to the section nearest the restroom. That type of care and thoughtfulness will always make me go back! The food is delicious, it's really clean and you can not beat all those smiles and friendly folks in there!"}
{"text":"Huge portions,  great food, friendly and attentive staff.  1st time trying The Place and it did not disappoint. My 14 old son couldn't even finish the 16oz steak and eggs. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 6 others for a late breakfast/early lunch. I have been to the place many times and started going when it was at the old location.   The food is always good, servers friendly, and business is booming.   Today I ordered the waffle breakfast which came with a waffle, 2 eggs, ham, and hash browns. It is a ton of food and I loved every bite. I was starving when I got there and I am now full and ready for a nap.   I will continue to come to the place and I'm happy business is good."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and will go back often. Very nice choice on the menu to build your own omelet or burrito.  Healthy choices are available and food was fresh. Thanks again yelp!"}
{"text":"I love Mike and Ronda and am so excited that The Place is in Phoenix now! Their food is always delicious and service is pretty solid.  The 3 stars is for a weird incident during my meal with my family. One of the waiters or server thought it was a good idea to come over to our table in the middle of our meal to change out the salt, pepper and sugar. All of which were already full. Then about 2 minutes later, a waitress came over to our table to also change our salt, pepper and sugar.  There's a big difference between providing good customer service and interrupting a meal. Refilling salt, pepper and sugar can be filled anytime when people are not eating."}
{"text":"Only open for breakfast and lunch. If you go away hungry, it's your own danged fault. LOL"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be my go-to breakfast place because of their wonderfully portioned and inexpensive food. I stopped going here for a few reasons: bad service, long wait, inconsistent food.   For me, food must taste, look, and feel the same every time I get it. There were many times I was slapped a plate of food and it was soggy, slightly warm, or uncooked/burnt. After a while I realized I could make the same breakfast at home and cook it to my liking. To say the least, their food used to be good and now it's \"you get what you pay for\", sadly. Their pricing has always been fairly cheap and that's what I loved most, get a large plate of food for less than $8.  The main reason I stopped going was because of the service. For some reason, service has drastically declined. Each time I've walked in I see the host/hostess and they look and act miserable. When I put my name in for my party the first thing I do is judge the front desk service and it is very unwelcoming. Some servers act the same too; unwelcoming, rushed, and altogether unhappy. I've been given the stink face before for simply asking for new bacon because it was undercooked, only to be given burnt bacon in return. I've also asked for a refill of coffee 3 times in a row and never got a refill. I was sitting two booths away from a coffee station. Overall their service comes with a negative attitude that frankly I don't want to see in the morning! I would say they are not morning people at all.   I wish I could say their food makes up for their lack of service but I can't. I recommend trying it for yourself because they really do have good prices for big breakfast plates that could easily be shared (which cost $2 extra) but know that it comes with distasteful and inconsistent service."}
{"text":"I came here for my first time and I've been back almost every week since. The bacon omelette (build your own) is sooo good! I love their bacon. Also, their portions are huge but I still manage to finish everything somehow. Walking to my car afterwards has definitely been an issue every time.  It gets really busy but I usually go straight to the counter in front of the kitchen to skip the 15 minute waits."}
{"text":"First time here. Typical, run of the mill American breakfast fare. I ordered the \"eggs and meat\" which came with hash browns, sausage, toast, and eggs. The sausages tasted pretty bland and mushy and didn't seem cooked all the way through. The toast was nice thick cuts of sourdough, however, only one side was toasted and only very lightly at that. The hash browns looked promising as they looked crispy on the outside but they give you so much that the inside and bottom aren't really cooked at all. Overall, for me, this place is nothing to get excited about and I won't be going back anytime soon. It seems to be a very popular place, though, as it was packed and lots were waiting."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.... have been a customer of \"the place\" for years even before it's current location.... great breakfast !  A definite must try if you haven't yet ....be hungry you will get your money's worth !!"}
{"text":"Three of us ate here around noon. The food is still hanging around my stomach at 4PM. Not a good sign.   The decor is a cross between a cheap office building and a cheap restaurant. I would have forgiven the terrible interior, if the food would have been anything else but what it had.   The food, my friends, was a cross between airport food, bad diner food, and play dough. Ok, the play dough was an exaggeration, but it was crappy to say the least.   The french toast was small, substandard, and boring. The eggs were average. The hash browns were crispy on the outside, but mushy on the inside. They also came with a nice size imprint of half our servers hand (Yummy-yumsters!!!)   The biscuits were alright. I guess the worst thing about eating here, besides the food, was the feeling that no one truly wanted to be there. The servers or the customers. Why isn't there a really good place for breakfast in such a big city? No matter where I go, I am not blown away at all. Sad really."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 stars, rounded down to a 3. It's solid, down home brunch food that's done well. We came here over Father's Day Sunday, so it was very busy. Being that it was just my husband and myself, we didn't have to wait very long to get seated at all. I have a feeling that it's always pretty busy- the kind of food they serve appeals very much to the suburban crowd of North Phoenix.    I'm not sure where they used to be, but this is their new location. It's really nice, done in the style of modern lodge I guess. Lots of wood, but a bit sleeker. They have a full bar, so we were able to have beer and mimosas with our lunch, which I certainly appreciated!   The menu is solid, good and filling. Most anything you'd find at a Denny's you'd find here. I built my own omelette- an egg white omelette with peppers, spinach and chorizo. This was a winner- I've never had the option to add chorizo, and the spices in it made the omelette truly outstanding. They also have these giant, fluffy home made biscuits that are pretty awesome. It always comes with big dipping bowls of creamy gravy to dip into. It's a bit runnier than I'm used to with gravy, but it still tasted pretty wonderful.   Not something you should go out of your way to check out, but if you're in the area do stop by. You probably won't be disappointed, as long as you don't set your expectations too high."}
{"text":"THE place to go for breakfast in this part of Phoenix.  This is where we take relatives for breakfast when they come to visit.  Family diner atmosphere.  Can get pretty busy on the weekends so there may be a bit of a wait for seating.  Otherwise, the food and service are good.  Recommend the Arizona omelette."}
{"text":"The only reason we came here was because it had good reviews on Yelp. Checked in. Was told there would be about a 25 minute wait; completely understandable for a highly rated restaurant. Was given the standard buzzer/pager and went outside to wait. 25 minutes later, our buzzer alerted us and we went inside. A \"matter of fact\" woman  (named Nikki) told us that we could have the worst seat in the house and receive a  10% discount off of our meal. I suggested she make it 25%  and she would have herself a deal. She told me 10% is the best they would do and told me to quit being \"rude\". I told her I wasn't being rude, I was merely negotiating. She then gave us a different buzzer/pager and told us we would have to wait even longer. Not off to a good start, by any means. Once our turn was up, our waiter Nick took great care of us. Nick was very attentive and kept our coffee cups full. We split an omelette with bacon, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms and pepper jack cheese with a side of diced potatoes and their biscuits and gravy. They charged us an extra dollar to split the meal so I assumed they would split it for us in the kitchen; this wasn't the case at all. They brought the meal out along with an extra plate. I asked Nick why the extra charge, basically for nothing, he looked at us apologetically and said he really didn't know. The food was just ok, more than likely spoiled by the hostesses bad attitude. I got the feeling that they were busy and if I didn't like it, that was just too bad. I rode 25 minutes to eat at this restaurant, I definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Our 1st time in and we have been driving by this place for years. My wife ordered a steak, when it arrived it was huge and very tasty! I my self ordered a burrito w/ double bacon and ect and was also amazing! Amazing food, prices, and excellent customer service! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. I kept hearing how great this place was and since I am in town visiting family, I could not wait to try it. I got the eggs Benedict special with hash browns. Everyone says the portions are huge... Not the case in my meal. My hash browns were VERY DRY and tasted as if they have been sitting in the skillet all morning. The hollandaise sauce for my eggs Benedict was bland and so thick I thought I was eating cold, condensed soup from a can. I ate one Benedict, two bites of hash browns and asked for the bill. When the waitress saw that I barely ate my food, she didn't even ask me how it was. I got my to go box and threw my meal away in the garbage out front. This place was such a disappointment and I will not return. I choose Black Bear Diner down the street over this place any day."}
{"text":"So far not a good experience. I walk in. No one acknowledges me. Finally a young gal asks me for how many. No good morning, welcome or anything. She asks me my number. I give it. She says to the next person how many. Unfortunately I had to interrupt them and ask how long. She said 15 minutes. Is that hard? I give you something I expect you to say something in return. Our server, Dan, was awesome. Food was a B. Nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Breakfast was served so quickly on a busy Sunday morning. Dave is a great server, entertained us with an excellent John Wayne impression! This place is very busy for a reason! Great food, quick and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Tried this place out a month or so ago and learned they had all you can eat fish on Fridays. The fish was yummy. Sadly, they will not allow you to substitute the cole slaw and fries for a side salad even if you offer to pay them a $1 or $2 more dollars.  ** Well, after today, if really doesn't matter how good the fish was a month or so ago because today it was the pits. The first 2 pieces were okay but nothing like before, the second piece was absolutely awful, oh my gosh it was just gross. Never going back. Our waitress was good but I really did not like listening to the other waiters and waitress complaining how slow the lunch crowd has been for the last couple of weeks. Maybe, that is a clue there's a problem in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around noonish to buy breakfast for some friends who helped me move into an apartment. The wait was very long, I guess that is to expected on a Sunday. We finally were seated, and it took a good 20 min before our order was taken. Took some time to get our food, and when it did arrive, mine was just meh. I had a call-your-own scramble/omelette thing with bacon, jalapeños, sausage and cheese. It would have been good if the eggs weren't undercooked.  It came with a ton of hash browns, and some big-ass biscuits with gravy on the side. All in all, in was just meh. Portions were large enough to feed 2 people if needed. I'd be willing to give it a try again though, because I've heard good things...."}
{"text":"Went to the new location and it is nice in there.  The a/c wasn't working too well tho. The 4 of us had bad service.  So I thought I would give it another shot today. (maybe the service was bad the first time b/c it is a new place). Nope I got the same server and she just sucks.  I waited for awhile before she came over.  The people who arrived 10 mins. after me got their food before me. My food was dropped off by another person. I had to summons her over to request missing food items, a napkin, and water.  Sat there forever and waited for the bill and when I came from the bathroom, still no bill. Finally went up to the bar so I could pay her."}
{"text":"The Place is our go to breakfast spot! The food has always been great & portion sizes are large. Everything is very affordable! The service has always been quick... Even during their busy breakfast hours we have never had to wait long and our food is quickly delivered. We have yet to try anything other than their breakfast dishes and don't know if we will... Their breakfast is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I first heard about Mike and Ronda's \"The Place\" when i lived in Flagstaff.  I found in Flagstaff that the service was top notch and you can get a lot of food for your dollar.  I now have the benefit of living near this location and the service is just as good.  One thing I will also say is that the service is consistent.  On the weekends the lines are long but they do a great job moving people through."}
{"text":"First time here. Hostess wasn't that friendly but food was good and plenty and the resto was packed and busy even on a weekday. Server was nice."}
{"text":"The only reason I did not give this scrumptious place 5 stars is because there is always a line out the door when I happen to be in the area. Friendly staff, quick service, large portions, good price, what more could you ask? Yumm! I love this place and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I stopped in!  I heard great things about \"The Place\", now I know why!  Monster size portions/soft drinks, friendly staff, warm atmosphere, and unbelievable prices. Their food is home cooking done right!  A must try!!  Come hungry, leave full, content and with lefties to take home."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch had an omelette build your own it was great. Fast service, polite waiter and excellent customer service. Will go visit again."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we've been here and loving it all over again. It's nice to see an establishment that has a huge following. The was was 30 minutes but we'll worth it. Have you seen their biscuits??!! Dayum!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a college student in Flagstaff and am so glad to be able to satisfy my craving in Phoenix too!  They have huge portions, inexpensive prices and great drinks at the bar too!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit.  The best by far.  Not because of the food but because of our server Josh!  He had such an amplified personality.  Great delivery on specials.  A sense of humor.  Hustled his section like no other and didn't push us to leave as soon as we were done.  Josh gets a gold star super duper today!"}
{"text":"This is the number one hangover breakfast joint of all time.  Breakfast's are huge and delicious, just like mama would have used to make, if mama were one of those mamas, that used to make such meals.   Mike and Rhonda have the sort of joint that my grandfather loves. He doesn't drink, but for some reason he eats nothing but excellent hang-over food. Sometimes I go there sober with him.  The biscuits and gravy are possibly the best I have ever had, though addmittedly this is only because the biscuits are so amazing they carry the mediocre gravy.  The service is fast and efficient. I have never had to hold my aching, drowsy, hung-over head up long before the food arrived, and the giant drink glasses are perfect for re-hydrating."}
{"text":"Grrrrreasy , greasy , greasy grease. I used to really like this place. We arrived late the server seemed like she didn't want any hassle we were not  not prepared to give any. We took  the servers recommendations. Who doesn't love a little grease but hold up there is an acceptable level of Grease. I always get breakfast stuff and never experienced any problem but I tried the grilled ham-and-cheese  on rye. The onion rings were sad and ghetto,  I swear that's the most disgusting most repugnant sandwich I've ever tasted. I obviously didn't eat it I brought it up with the server she said you \"Would you like to try something else ?\" which she really did not want to offer an alternative so late in the day and  that was very clear. I don't blame her I blame the crap that was presented to the table . Not coming back . Sorry."}
{"text":"This was our first visit at The Place. It definitely will not be our last. Our food came out quickly and exactly as ordered. The biscuits were delicious!"}
{"text":"It's the bomb.com Best biscuit and gravy this side on the Milky Way Galaxy. I don't have anything else to say but yelp makes you right more for it to be considered a review."}
{"text":"The place! Huge portions, great staff, amazing atmosphere. Every time I go I'm happy. I'm a big guy and I get full. You might need to get a to go box because you might still have food on your plate. Steve is the greatest, and he's a giant bodybuilder and you can't miss him. I recommend the chicken fried steak, it's  awesome."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, and I love it. There's always a line out front, but I've never waited more than 20mins.  If you're a bacon lover, you will definitely want to check this place out-- they have that thick cut bacon that is sooooo good."}
{"text":"Ok. I'm really NOT sure what all the hype is about with this place.  First on the service.  The front desk seemed more interested in their own conversations. The wait wasn't long since there were only two of us. So, about 10-15 minute wait. Our server (Brittany) wasn't too friendly, but I'm sure she had her reasons. I mean it was Good Friday and they were pretty busy. But we saw her three times (sometimes that's a good thing lol). We saw her when she took our order, gave us our ticket, and took our payment. My hubby asked if they were known for the three options waffles, french toast, or pancakes. She said a casually no and that was it as if she did not care to give us input on what to get.    Review of the food: the cinnamon roll was filled with lots of frosting. So, if you like sweet stuff this is definitely for you. My husband got the french toast, eggs, and bacon. I got eggs benedict. I was so excited to try their food finally, but what a huge disappointment. The hollandaise sauce was too cheesy, the scrambled eggs were hard and burnt, the best part of our meal was the bacon. The bacon was delicious.   We left there feeling glad we tried it but no need to come back. My hubby even said he wasn't sure what all the fuss was about. He's not a picky eater like I am. We think Black Bear was way better. Food and service."}
{"text":"Great place for Breakfast. We had six in our party and arrived at 7:45 Saturday morning. We only had to wait five minutes for a table. Lots of choices on menu. All of us ordered skillets and I had side of chocolate chip pancakes. Everything was excellent, food and service.   Looking forward to next visit."}
{"text":"Stand out log cabin themed breakfast spot for the family. Portions are generous, prices are good & menu is relatively extensive. Service is above average because servers while talented are often swamped. Dress is very casual, arrive early as the regulars rarely miss an opportunity. Can't wake up early, dodge the line & eat w/ the bartender. She is a great server and long standing employee. Biscuits & gravy was a head turner, eggs were light & flavorful. Bring your appetite."}
{"text":"The food at this place is good,but the service is horrible!I know that they are busy but there's no reason for them to not give me any service.Today I went there with my friend,they never check on us when I ask for a check there was no one there and no one tend to help us at all.What I see is they give service to Americans but me and my friend,so this place discriminated against Asians?We still left tips for them, but a place that doesn't give you any service and only serve certain people is a place that I'll not go back,I don't care how good their food is.If you careless about your customer might as well don't run the business!"}
{"text":"Great food and waitstaff! Food is always consistent. Wait is long on weekend. Never had a problem. Highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Wow it doesn't take much to satisfy some people. That said The Place is horrible! Every time we went it was bad. Even the pancakes had a strange flavor that when  i told my wife she tasted it and spit it out. We will never go back and  we see the people lined up on the weekends to get in this place we shake our heads in disbelief. Can make this food at home way better in minutes do not recommend"}
{"text":"Food is tasty and soooo much of it! Don't hesitate to share something - they give you huge portions. Super staff. Wait time insane unless you put yourself on the list ahead of time. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. We enjoyed the atmosphere as well. We got the standard eggs, pancakes, waffle, meat options, all good."}
{"text":"I lived in Flagstaff when the original Mike and Ronda's opened, and it was always the place to go for good breakfasts that filled you up.    This location was not that.    Ordered a build your own breakfast burrito (sausage, pepper jack, jalapeños, onions, green chili, hash browns and a side of salsa.    Never saw the salsa.  The burrito had good flavor, but it was small.  The hash browns were cooked well, but again not the amount that the original restaurant served.    Coffee was in a small sized cup but the cup was VERY thick which meant the actual volume per cup was about 2 shot glasses.  They meant you frequent refills - and service wasn't frequent enough.    Overall disappointing visit, when I was expecting something like the original.  I was looking forward to getting a large meal, and was very disappointed.   Now compare this to Denny's - it's flavor was much better."}
{"text":"Seen this driving down Bell road, and being from Flagstaff where Mike and Rhonda's started had to check it out. Food was great and service was great too."}
{"text":"The pancakes are AWEFUL! Raw in the middle, NO BUTTER! NO MAPLE-even though they advertise Maple syrup it's maple FLAVORED syrup! When I asked about it they offered the real stuff IF I was willing to buy it separate! My son spit up and got some on the floor. They smeared it a little but left nasty chunks and thick smears instead of cleaning it up! Also if two ppl share a meal they charge extra for that! We spent $33 for my husband and I to eat a shoddy Dennys quality breakfast.  Needless to say, I'll NEVER come back!"}
{"text":"Here for breakfast today. Most excellent service. Seated promptly and courteously, our waiter was awesome, and the other wait people help each other out with coffee filling and plate clearing. Very attentive.   i had the french toast which was perfecto and my friend had the eggs benedict substituting good old american bacon for that infernal canadian bacon which they did most happily. It was also a taste delight.  Nice ambiance.  They do have just ordinary coffee cups to enjoy your coffee with but i never really expect different.  Prices are also very reasonable and overall I would say one of the better breakfast places on the west side."}
{"text":"Had to come back to the place for the bacon cause I love their bacon. 2nd time being there. I brought my cuz and step brother and they agreed the bacon is amazing. I tried there biscuit and gravy. it was great. Not a fan of the diced potatoes though. =( my cuz and step brother were not a fan of the gravy but I enjoyed it I couldn't stop tearing my food up. My bf is satisfied that I brought him home left overs.  The place is the place to be =)"}
{"text":"Portion sizes galore!  My boyfriend and I go here as often as we can.  We are on the other side of town so it's not as often as I'd like but it's a treat every time.  First things first, lets talk biscuits and gravy.  These things are HUGE.  Each biscuit is homemade and about the size of your fist.  You get 2 of them per order.  I can barely finish one myself.  The hash browns are probably some of the best I've ever had and I only have touse salt and pepper on them. Truly delicious.  We get the Meat and Eggs meal and we split it between my Boyfriend and myself and both leave completely satisfied.   There is always a line there on weekend mornings but don't let it discourage you!  it goes rather quickly and the lobby of The Place is comfortable and cozy, so settle right in!   The waitresses are attentive and will refill your coffee for you before you even realize it needs a refill!    Best part?  If youre coming in a group of two, you may be so lucky enough to get \"the worst seat in house\" (seriously, it's a thing).  This is a table for two tucked in the corner and though there isnt much space, it is very cozy and you willg et a 10% discount off your bill if you sit here!  It's kind of difficult to find consistently good breakfast places in the valley but The Place has done a fine job of keeping my business time and time again, and many more to come!  Not a huge breakfast food fan? S'OK, they have lunch items too!"}
{"text":"Thank you yelp!  The app that is that is the crystal ball of my often times consumer life...AGAIN...did not steer me wrong.  So there we were in Peoria, AZ.....for yet another MLB Spring Training and were in need of some \"nutrition\" before checking out some San Diego Padre bunt practice before their afternoon game.  Mike & Ronda's appeared to be the obvious place (Glendale)c to visit while en route to the sports park.  We were blessed to find the calm in storm of diners, and opted to sit at counter.  Blessed again to be near the kitchen....I marveled at the symphony of motion and efficiency watching the servers and cooks do their thing.  BEER!  YES!  Beer for breakfast is one of my most favorite things.  I was able to consume a \"Copper State IPA (Arizona)\" from Huss Brewing Company in Tempe, AZ, during my breaking the fast meal.  Four bottle caps were given....for the beer.  The beer along with chicken fried steak, I ordered was pure breakfast porn.  One complimenting the other.  Toes curled, eyes rolling back into ones head.  But I digress.  I ordered the chicken fried steak.  It comes with eggs and potatoes and Biscuit & Gravy, Toast, Pancakes, Tortilla or Muffin of the Day.  Tortilla was the order of the early day.  It was smashing!    An absolutely positive experience.  See you next year Mike & Ronda!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food has always been great and the serves has been even better.  Shout out to my server today Kayla for her great service today."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.   The man and I decided that since these are our last two days in Arizona, we needed to try as many non-chain places as possible. Also, since all of our kitchen is packed in boxes, we needed some breakfast food this morning. Yelp to the rescue and cue..Mike & Rhondas!  Wow. This place definitely lived up to the hype. You know you've found a keeper when they have advertisements around the boarder of the menu. I got a build-your-own omelette with egg whites only (yesssss!!), peppers, onions, ham, and pepperjack cheese. It came with hashbrowns and I ordered fruit instead of breads. No extra charge! The man ordered \"The hungry man\" meal which came with 3 eggs, 2 sausage patties, hashbrowns, and three HUGE biscuts with gravy...the size of your head!!   The battle between my man and the hungry man ended in a doggie bag to take home.. neither of us could finish our meals. We brought home what could easily be a third meal.  Friendly, ridiculously fast service. I only wish I had found this place 2 years ago when I first moved here, rather than 2 days before I was leaving!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, great service. But way too busy and it affects your eating experience.  After finding this place after a trusty Yelp search, there was a bit of a line. After 15 minutes we were seated in a smallish booth for four people. The waitress was excellent with fast service on drinks and taking orders. Portions were mammoth (as promised by other Yelpers), but still quality in taste and appearance. $35 for 4 people with drinks isn't too bad price wise.  My only complaint keeping this place from 4 stars was the manic movements of the waitresses which resulted in my just not being comfortable. It just felt rushed and uncomfortable, even though the waitresses were not pushing us out. It's hard to explain, so see for yourself. This place needs an expansion and more comforting decor. Worth a try, but you'll feel like your in a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Just left from breakfast. Our 1st time. Portions are HUGE!  Service was fast and friendly. I'm only giving 3 starts because 2 of my 3 pancakes were burned. My husbands hash browns were burned and hard as a rock. He loved the Chicken Fried Steak but would have enjoyed it so much more had the hash browns been edible. We didn't say anything because we have a Graduation to get to but we will back if we are in the area to try it again."}
{"text":"If you plan on coming I highly recommend downloading the no wait app you can check in before you come and it saves on waiting we do it all the time now and today we had no wait cuz as soon as we got here they were ready for us. Saved on what would have been a 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"I thought it was gross. \"Fresh fruit\" was anything but along with the warm cottage cheese.  Though my fiancé was much more happy with his traditional biscuits gravy and proteins."}
{"text":"Long line to get in, but seated at bar within ten minutes. Food was excellent!   Gravy on my wife's hot beef sandwich was that old-school shiny brown that we remember from days long ago. Her mashed potatoes appeared to to have been wearing peels not too long ago. Obviously NOT instant.   I ordered a patty melt and was surprised a little when I was asked how I wanted it cooked. I was even more surprised when it came out precisely as I asked!    My daughter-in-law commented that her chicken fried steak was served with the breading still crispy, unlike frozen maybe-meat things that are so very common elsewhere.   My son commented how much he enjoyed his prime rib sandwich, but I have no specifics.   Now, about our server!  I'm pretty sure that lady walked five miles while we were there!  Amazing attitude, and neat personality to go with it. None of us was able to get our drinks down to the halfway point. I really wish I'd gotten her name!  None of us ordered alcohol, but the selection of draft beers was really tempting! Bar seemed to be very well-stocked with a great variety of neat-looking stuff in a wide range of tastes.   All in all?  Great food, excellent service, generous portions, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place is always super packed. My husband is not a big breakfast eater so we rarely go out to breakfast and never wait in line for breakfast. My husband and I happened to have the same weekday morning off.... which happens once every 4-5 years so we went here. It is down home comfort breakfast food. Great pancakes, hash browns, eggs and bacon( yes I ordered it all.....I never go out to breakfast) and I took half home and ate it for dinner. I"}
{"text":"The Place serves up the biggest portioned breakfasts you've ever seen! I ordered the meat and eggs with diced ham in scrambled eggs, diced potatoes, and toast. The meat and eggs were basic but good. The diced potatoes were greasy and tasted like the curly fries at Arby's! Toast was covered in butter. Probably not the greatest place to go to when you are watching your diet, but great for feeding a bunch of really hungry people! I like that they give you the option of ordering toast, biscuits and gravy, pancakes or tortillas with your entrees. Good prices for the amount of food you get and super quick service too."}
{"text":"Breakfast is delicious especially when you add their unique bloody mary :)"}
{"text":"Delicious. Absolutely delicious.  I've been coming here for breakfast for the past year and a half and it's never disappointed.  Staff is always very friendly and helpful, prices are great for what you're getting, and the food is delicious.  The bacon is thick and crispy and easily my favorite part of the meals.    Bottom line: If you want breakfast and you're nearby, go to Mike and Ronda's"}
{"text":"Everytime we come here we enjoy the food. We been coming here since they were open across the street from their original location. No matter what we eat, the food is awesome!    Today we used the \"Wait List\" feature on Yelp and by the time we arrived, our table was ready. The restaurant was packed for the morning rush but the food still was quick to come out as usual.   If you haven't been here before, check it out and use the \"Wait List\" feature so you will have the same awesome experience we always have when we come to eat here.   The portions is still huge for what you pay for and the soda comes in huge plastic cups as well."}
{"text":"The French vanilla coffee was ridiculously sweet. Service was awesome. Though they were packed, they got us in pretty quick. My husband loved his prime rib skillet with gunslinger sauce. The place was clean and I'd visit there again. Wheat pancakes were tasteful but were burnt on one side. The French toast tasted weird. The chicken fried steak was pretty decent considering I've never had one. Over easy eggs were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"The place is always great. I have eaten here 20 + times, the service is never mediocre. The servings are huge, try the chicken fried steak its yummy."}
{"text":"I go here every year for Mother's Day (hey that is how the family rolls)  we get there at 7am, as soon as it opens so we can get a big table.  The food is great. I built my own omelette - bacon, American, avocado, sour cream, and tomatoes... with potato bites and a pancake. Whatever you do you have to get the potato bites as they are probably some of the best I've had. Crunchy yet soft and plenty of flavor. Omelette as I ordered it was delicious. Pretty big too. Two big pancakes and those were good albeit nothing to win awards with.  Never seen anyone complain about any of the food.  Service is pretty good despite always having a large party. Food also comes out pretty fast, especially for a big group."}
{"text":"Typical diner-style establishment, with greasy yummy breakfast food served all day. Just my pace after a night of drinking that caused me to rise bright and early at....1pm. The service was excellent, I didn't have to ask for any of my 4 coffee refills. Portions were huge! The biscuits were delicious and buttery, just melted in your mouth. I decided on a made to order egg white omelet with pepper jack, green chili and avocado that came with two biscuits and hash browns. RM ordered the corned beef hash breakfast that was accompanied by two eggs, hash browns and biscuits and gravy. With beverages, the bill was about $18! What a deal.   If you crave greasy but tasty breakfast, with great service for a steal, you have to try The Place. You will leave with a full belly, ready for a nap."}
{"text":"Delicious, Fresh, and awesome breakfast.  We had such a good time, and their service was top notch. They never once let our coffee cup be empty."}
{"text":"I loved this place in Flagstaff... but it doesn't seem as good here. Maybe its the air. ha-ha.... I love that they give generous portions, but I wish they would use a different pancake mix. This one is too heavy, not light and fluffy the way pancakes are supposed to be. I suspect they are using their biscuit mix. But all in all a good bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Overall very good experience. My wife and I went there on a Saturday morning for breakfast. I ordered the Meat Breakfast with sausage and my wife ordered hers with bacon. As other reviews have noted, the portions are big.  Service was good, food was good, and the overall diner atmosphere was good, too. Not an upscale place, but The Place has a hometown feel to it.   It's difficult for me to give a 5 star rating based on one experience. Thus, if/when I go there again and the service, food, etc. are the same, I'll update my rating."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Quick and friendly service, even when they are swamped. The food was great- had a sausage, jalapeño, and bell pepper omelette with hash browns, buscuits and gravy with coffee. Everything was fresh and great tasting.  My toddler had the french toast breakfast with bacon and eggs.  Of course I tasted his- and it was great. Especially the bacon!!  We would love to come back!  Also, atmosphere is a comfy breakfast spot and the price is very fair for the generous portion sizes!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast food with some of the best biscuits and gravy in town! Unfortunately, today I tried the buffalo chicken salad with grilled chicken and I was not impressed to say the least! The chicken was dry and overall the salad was blah. I could have made a better salad at home."}
{"text":"The best diner ever!  WHY you ask:  Service _Fast _Throw any variations, or complicated instructions at them, your dish will still come out perfect. _They will refill your coffee cup or any other beverage before you ask.

Absolute power breakfast and came out exactly as ordered.  Perfection. _MG had the chicken fried steak, gravy on the side, 2 biscuits as big as your face, hashbrowns and I ate the egg whites.  The steak was also familiarly great, the hashbrowns, crispy and not overly buttery, gravy perfectly salted.  Food-Visit 2 $13 bill _I had the same except for only one piece of toast and it came out screaming perfection again. _MG had the Corned Beef Hash breakfast, again familiarly salty and delicious, with the fluffy Simply Bread Wheat toast, and half a plates worth of hashbrowns, I ate the egg whites.  Food-Visit 3 $15 bill _ I ventured out of my comfort zone and after 2 hours at the gym needed a lil more than oatmeal.  I had a slice of the fluffy toast and a 3 egg white dry omelette with no cheese, moist chicken breast, abundant spinach, light avocado, mushroom and cooked through onion.  It was beyond filling and thoroughly satisfied my tastebuds. _MG had the hashbrowns and biscuitgravy that came from my meal.  Along with some extra sausage patties that were moist and crispy.  Please go to The Place if you are down for great food, great service, great prices."}
{"text":"Fast breakfast service. Sometimes a long wait for a table. Order less than you think you'd normally eat--portions are huge... Almost too big (borderline wasteful).  I've only had breakfast here.  To me, there is nothing really special about this place.  It seems pretty \"dump and serve\". The gravy for the biscuits and gravy tastes like a powder mix with some sausage thrown in.  The biscuits are big, but tasteless and generally dry.   The breakfast prices are inexpensive for the amount of food you receive."}
{"text":"I don't get how this place can average 4 Stars. (as of today, anyway) One thing I can say for sure is that this place is NOT \"The Place\" to go. We  sit down and the table was \"dirty\", covered in salt and crumbs. I had to wipe down the table myself. We order drinks and my tea comes in a \"dirty\" glass with lip stick on it. GROSS!!!! I look around and see food and dirty napkins on the floor. At this point, I'm thinking WE NEED TO LEAVE! However, my husband says lets just stay. Our food comes and its not good. We had lunch items. So, maybe they are known for their breakfast and that it what we should have ordered. I took two bites and was done. We spent $30, left hungry and went to another restaurant. If the place wasn't so dirty, maybe I would have gone back to try the breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this place. Sure it's always packed and busy but if you use the app called \"no wait\" it so easy to check in while still driving to it. I adore the biscuits and gravy! Always my favorite. Huge portions too. Kids meals are very decently priced and I'm able to add extra sides to accommodate my older daughter that eats a little more then a kids meal but not a full adult meal. Always a go to for a family Sunday  breakfast out"}
{"text":"Lol we literally sat,ate and left in 20min it was crazy they definitely know what there doing here lol great food"}
{"text":"When it comes to hearty breakfast The Place is most definitely the place. The only negative is that it's so good that the wait is longer than normal but well worth it."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Our server Jackie took very good care of us. The value for the size of the portions is great.  I will make it a point to come back next time I am town. We had five of us and not one bad breakfast meal. The restaurant was clean as were the restrooms. I totally recommend The Place!"}
{"text":"Good home fatting food. Leave with your belly full. Staff friendly enough."}
{"text":"As you all know they moved to a bigger location across 51st Ave.  Unfortunately the service is just as bad and the food is just as mediocre.  Went with a party of 7 and was told it would be 30 minutes.  We waited for much longer than that and as we were waiting they were seating parties of 5 and 6 that came much much after us.  When we asked why we had been skipped 7 times on the list they said they were waiting for two tables in the middle to free up.  So all the time we were waiting and could have easily fit in many seats they were waiting for the only two tables in the joint for us to sit at.  Absolutely rediculous.    Our waitress was actually wonderful once we were permitted access to the restaurant.  Unfortunately the food was just mediocre once again.  Not sure why people line up for this place.  Just goes to show there is absolutely nowhere worth eating breakfast at in about a 15 mile radius of The Place.  Poor front desk service, large portions, average price, and mediocre food pretty much sums it up.  If a great breakfast place opened up anywhere from 51st Ave to 83rd ave and Bell Rd they would make a KILLING."}
{"text":"How can this place be any good ? We noticed all the reviews and thought we shud try this place.  Thank god we signed into yelp to be on the waiting list to be seated, Bc god forbid if I waited 1-2 hours for awful food . I ordered a veggie omelet with a side of hash browns. First of all, my eggs were over cooked/burnt!! I hate burnt eggs !! Eggs should not be burnt !!!! Second of all, the omelet had no flavor. Orange juice tasted store bought. Our waitress was friendly and fast so that is why I left 2 Stars! Enough said ..."}
{"text":"The Place has good food, cheap prices & is always packed. I'm happy they moved across 51st Ave into a bigger restaurant because you almost always had to wait for a table before. Their biscuits are so good, homemade, fresh & fluffy. It's not my favorite breakfast joint but it's still good."}
{"text":"My go to place for a big breakfast. Portions are big enough to split if you're budgeting meals. Quality is not too bad either. Different variety to chose from the menu. Love how you can add yourself to the waitlist online, this place can get busy and the wait can be around 30 min or so. So far I been happy with my visits here."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I have found. Great food! fresh pancakes! The portions are huge so come hungry! If you get there later then 9 you will have a wait."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Friendly! Delicious! Great price! No complaints whatsoever. We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. The service & management? Terrible. I went there with a family of 7, they sat us at a small circle table (which we waited 50 minutes for). When we ordered our food, each person had 2 plates for their breakfast. We asked for a bigger table prior to being seated & they refused. We had to eat crammed together & reaching over each other's food for our drinks or to get to our second plate. Could really improve on their service."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite with you. I've only had bfast there, and it's awesome. Its a ton of food with excellent quality. You can't go wrong with anything there."}
{"text":"Highly recommend, we used the Nowait app & walked right in. I had the prime rib skillet which was excellent and very filling, Laura had the French toast which also was excellent and very filling. This place is quick, easy, courteous, and well priced. We will return again since we are in the neighborhood. But bring your own filtered water! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place really has four stars???... My friends recommend it and looking at Yelp I was excited for a \"good\" breakfast place.. Oh was I wrong.. The service was good but the food was terrible. The bacon was soggy and and gross. The hash browns are literally pathetic.. They taste like nothing at all... My friend got cheese and onions on his to make it a little better. When the waitress came and asked how the food was I replied with the hash browns are terrible. She goes \"should of got it like your friends\" oh sorry I didn't know I had to get them a specific ways they are hash browns and it's my first time.. The biscuit.... Give you three gigantic biscuits that are just gross.. No flavor at all. No butter.. Looks like they just didn't care when they were making them.. Place was also very hot and also had no connection.. I just don't think this is the right place for breakfast.."}
{"text":"Got on the waitlist on the drive over. Wait time in the lobby was minimal. Food was quick and delicious!!! Polish skillet and prime skillets both super tasty, today's special was pancakes were sweet potato with maple pecan syrup- amazing! Price was decent, too."}
{"text":"Portions are ridiculously huge and prices are cheap - win win!  We shared a Chicken Fried Steak breakfast which was pretty darn tasty.  I wasn't very impressed with the pancakes or biscuits, although I certainly ate them anyways.  The steak was tasty, however and the gravy was tasty.  I took advantage of Yelp's check-in offer for a free pastry, but was disappointed in my bear claw.  It was no better than one I'd pick up at a grocery store's bakery.  You know it couldn't have been amazing if I only took two bites of a pastry!   If you're in need of a standard, cheap diner-style breakfast... go check it out! But if you crave something above typical diner-style fare, keep looking!"}
{"text":"This place is yummy and very affordable. Great spot to have breakfast or brunch with girlfriends or family. The portions are pretty big so order wisely or else you'll get stuck with plenty of leftovers but if you have pups that shouldn't be a problem. Very country and an open bar. Who doesn't like an open bar to go along with some pancakes. Customer service is awesome. A very family friendly business."}
{"text":"Yum! Big portions, reasonable prices, friendly service! TV's to watch Sunday's big games. Bar and free take home coffee!  Blueberry syrup was fantastic on light n fluffy pancakes, steak was yum! Not tough."}
{"text":"It's tough to find a non-chain breakfast place in Glendale. The Place fits that niche.   Portions are large but the food was mediocre at best. It is nice that you can design your own omelet or burrito, but the execution and ingredients were nothing to get excited about. Food was hot and service was good. I loved the building as it was clean and well decorated.  Great for a fast hot breakfast. Don't expect any culinary expertise."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST breakfast in town! Fast, friendly service and amazing food. Don't let the line outside detour you away - the wait is usually fairly short because the service is fast. I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"It is Sunday morning at 9:30 am.  I looked up best place for breakfast and found this place ( happens to named \"The Place\".)   It said to get on the wait list and since I was about 20 minutes, I did just that.  As I was literally turning my first aisle looking for a parking place I got the message \"Your table is ready.\" Couldn't have been better! People were lined up in front of and around the sides of the building, waiting for seats.   Note to self: check yelp, and call if there is a waiting list!   Inside it was crowded. The help were all running around, and smiling. Breakfast serving were really large, so I decided to order a patty melt (on white bread, American cheese and well done, with hash browns instead of fries.)  My drink was brought right away by Hannah, my server. About 10 minutes later my food came, as ordered, smelling and tasting great.  To sum up: I am highly recommending this place for breakfast and lunch. They are not open for dinner. Check to see if you need to get on the waiting list, and once you sit down, prepare to have a great meal! Cost for lunch with a drink was $12.95, including tax. I could have shared it easily, but as I am eating solo today, I boxed up the second half for supper tonight...yummy"}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant, we've been going to this establishment for many years.  The food and the workers are absolutely outstanding.  I highly recommend this place to everyone, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast recently. Big portions! Good hash browns and breakfast burritos. Scrambled eggs, though, are overcooked. Definitely worth a visit. :)"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for breakfast for about 4 years! Wait time for breakfast isn't bad- average about 15 minutes... Service is always top notch and fast! We need that with our two toddlers. Coffee is a bit pricey however and nothing super fancy with the menu. BUT The portions are large and the food is good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here around 11:30 so we could have had lunch or breakfast. We choose breakfast. The place was very busy but we didn't have to wait very long.  Our waitress Jackie immediately came to our table and took our drink order. Then gave us plenty of time to decide on our entrée.   I ordered the \"Build your own omelet\" With a side of cottage cheese and diced potatoes. I know it's hard to ruin breakfast but . . . this place does breakfast right. My omelet was perfect in every way.   My wife ordered 2 eggs (medium) w / waffles they were perfect as well. On a side note;   By the way we saw a couple of guys who ordered the biscuits & gavel. .. Holy cow they were  HUGE.   FOOD: Diner style comfort food. HUGE portions.  SERVICE: Our waitress Jackie was very friendly, and attentive. PRICE: Was NOT expensive at all for the quantity of food you get. CONCLUSION: The food was served hot , and quickly (even though they are very busy) and the way we wanted. I see why they are sooooooooooo busy. RETURN FACTOR 100%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and"}
{"text":"We had family from Michigan visit us a few months ago and we went out to breakfast at 3  Different places. The place was the best, good food and friendly people, huge portions too."}
{"text":"Still great omelets. Just a comment on pricing. Considered trying US Egg b/c I moved & it's a couple minutes closer, but their omelets are more expensive. They charge double (sometimes triple) for substitutions like fruit, egg whites, extra ingredients. If it ain't broke... I go crazy with substitutions and extras. Mike & Rondas gets it right and they don't overcharge me for it. My wallet and tummy are glad I stuck with the same Place."}
{"text":"2 meat breakfast cornedbeef hash two scrambled eggs hash browns 2 slices wheat toast for $8 = great deal.   2 cups of coffee=$5, not so great but is unlimited and the servers seem to check the adjacent tables for topoffs which is a courtesy not found at Denny's or IHOP.    The breakfast portions were healthy size and I thought the hash browns looked like a double portion. Hash browns were perfectly prepared the way I like, slight crunch and browning on the outside, soft and moist inside.   Wifey ordered the chicken fried steak   hash browns and pancakes = $9.50 = happy wife no complaints except the 2 pancakes were of different cooked Ievels.  Chefs kiddie breakfast seemed pricey, chocolate milk, mickey breakfast, extra egg = $8, lesson learned, chef is getting too old for the kiddie menu.    To be fair, we ordered 2 mornings in a row exact food.  Amanda was new on her 2nd day and seemed like we received above average service.  The next morning server Brittany gave us average service and did not introduce herself, didn't follow up after service, so guess who received the healthier tip.    The kitchen staff that delivered our meals were courteous and didn't mind taking my \"late\" orders which were delivered promptly. Didn't catch their names but was seamless.    Overall, the coffee could be stronger, service could be consistent, booths better prepared for the next patron but these are minor complaints for an overall positive 2 day breakfast experience at what might be our go to breakfast spot in Glendale.    The ambient noise was very tolerable and allowed me to work a bit. I also like the Tabasco dolly and extra napkins  at the table do you don't have to flag your server when chef spills syrup on the table."}
{"text":"Our first time here! Food was excellent! Server Hannah was very friendly and efficient! Will definitely come back !"}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best breakfast ever! The steak and eggs for under $10 is just unbelievable considering you could feed 3 with it!!"}
{"text":"They make a pretty good breakfast and the service is nice but the food is just so so not bad not great could use a little bit more flavor."}
{"text":"The staff was great, BUT, I called in an order for take out for 5 people, and I was irritated to learn upon pick-up that I was charged for the to-go boxes my food came in?!? Really? I have never experienced this and the fact that it was almost a $3.00 charge should have been mentioned during my order placement on the phone. I never know about tipping with to-go, but I always do even though I believe the tip should be reserved for the person who is serving your sit-down meal. So I had to spend almost an additional $10.00 to pick up the food. I will not go back to this location. Over rated. I was told one price, the given another because the staff forgot to tell me there were extra charges for my order. Not cool Mike and Rhonda @ The Place, not cool at all."}
{"text":"My family enjoys going to The Place! You will not go home hungry not have good old school dinner food! The place is family owned and run not only blood but the people that work for them is like family love the friendly staff! I would love to be a fly on the wall of the kitchen need to know how they make their pork green chile & the prefect hash browns! I have tried most of the ideas on the menu enjoyed it all. My favorites is the huevos rancheros, tune melt, make you own sandwich, chicken fried steak, the worlds best hash browns. Know this place is so good there is a wait in the normal hours we are late eaters getting there around 2pm so we bet the rush."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, price and atmosphere.   Definitely coming back for breakfast."}
{"text":"oOoh this is a good PLACE for breakfast! Got here around 12ish..was pretty packed..waited about 6 minutes for a seat...server was nice..everything on the menu is mostly breakfast but they do have some sandwiches, burger and salad selections.   I created my own 3-egg omelet...spinach, sausage, pepper jack cheese and sour cream! yumm! served with hash brown...though I wish I known cause I would have changed to to fruit because I do not like hash brown...and buttered English muffins.   funny thing about this place is there's a full bar...it's suppose to be a breakfast place but there's a full bar....haha only in Arizona...but I guess it's also because they have a huge big screen tv at the bar...so for fans of sport viewing.   I can't say they were that fast on coming out with our dishes...took at least 10 minutes or so...but delicious they indeed are!"}
{"text":"This is what real diner food is.  This sort of greasy, no frills place, is probably more true to the diners of my youth than those same old diners are today (I'm looking at you, Pano's).  Reminiscing aside, the food here is good.  It's not healthy, but that just means it's really good.  The serving sizes are big, but not the way some places give you a lot of food to make up for the fact it's not good food.  Every omelet I've had here has been filled with fresh meats, cheese, and vegetables.  The eggs alone are cooked with BUTTER and SALT like all eggs should be.  The coffee is the generic dark diner    variety and perfect for those days that you crave this type of food the most (you know the ones I mean).  Actually, the home fries are the only thing I can even think to complain about.  These are the home fries I love, shredded and fried on a flat top.  All I need to do is ask for them to be a bit crispier, and I'd be happy.  Personally, I find them a little too soft on the inside.  Am I gonna knock a star off for that?  No, they're still damn good.  Anyway, go there at least once.  You may not go there daily/weekly/etc after, but you'll be glad to know where it is when you need to find a place with coffee and greasy food."}
{"text":"Honestly, if I could give a negative number on the star scale, I would.  Everyone I knew absolutely RAVED about this place, so one evening, my family and I went. The service was awful, the food was cold, and they brought me out food with an allergen on it (which I SPECIFICIALLY told the server about). We chalked it up to the thought that this place is known for breakfast, and we were there in the evening. Our fault; let's try again in the morning sometime.  So we did. Again... epic failure. The service was terrible, the food was mediocre, and we had to ask repeatedly for someone to even bring our drinks  (yes, that's part of service, but deserves its own mention). It's been a few months now, but I just can't see going back.  Why do people like this place? I'm so confused when I see lines out the door. Was it just that we had 2 bad experiences that were flukes?  I can't see that."}
{"text":"When walking into the restaurant to pick up our to go order, I was not greeted by the front cashier or even acknowledged.  We had a pretty big brunch order and the waitress that brought our order to me was not very nice either and had a bit of an attitude when taking my card out of my hand.  We were disappointed that the food was cold given we had picked up within the 15 minutes it was going to be ready and the hash browns were bland. We really wanted to like this place especially after all of the good reviews."}
{"text":"I never liked biscuits and gravy until I tried theirs!! Everything I have had from here is great and the prices are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Second time in for breakfast, and all I can say is fantastic.  Well staffed, good seating, comfortable atmosphere, lots of parking, breakfast is delicious and cooked perfectly, and  all reasonably priced.    Weekend mornings can be REALLY BUSY (especially after 8:00 am) so be sure to use the convenient \"waitlist\" on their Yelp page.  If your here by yourself, just grab an open Seat at the counter or bar for even faster service.      Be sure to check out the specials board unique offerings, like Tiramisu French Toast and $4 Mimosa's."}
{"text":"One thing I alway notice is that there is a line out the door with many people waiting outside, which is always a good sign when it comes to brunch on the weekends.  That's one of the things that made my husband and I want to try this place.    The establishment itself looks like a cozy house and inside, it reminds me of a cabin.  The prices are very reasonable and great for sharing!  We shared the chicken fried steak and biscuits meal.  Biscuits were on point and for an extra cost, we had the jalepeno gravy which was top notch.  The chicken fried steak was massive and we couldn't finish it either.  Food is carb heaven and taste was great!  I would go back again when I have the urge to try more breakfast things here.   Great service, ample parking, and delicious food.  Glad to have a place like this in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this location and it was a fabulous time. Awesome staff. Coffee was perfect after getting out of class. Had hashbrowns were also a delight. I tried the banana cinnamon muffin which was good, different than I expected but good. I grabbed a cinnamon roll to go instead of biscuits and gravy and though it was a difficult choice, I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Busy day but my first time here. Had higher expectations based on the reviews. Big portions for the price, but the food is sub-par and bland. Waiter was more than amazing, but hostesses could be better."}
{"text":"David is the absolute best! He always has a smile on his face and is extremely approachable. I have brought many friends and family members here-locals and out of state peeps and we always have a great experience. The food is great! However even if they served garbage I would still come here to see David! The man is a sweetheart and always ready to tend to his guests. I can't say enough nice things about this gentleman. If you are thinking about checking out The Place, ask the hostess to sit in David's section you will be blown away by this great human! #DavidRules"}
{"text":"I have to say that \"The Place\" is a excellent place to go for breakfast! There was a huge crowd for a typical Sunday late morning and we waited for about 15 minutes. The crew was friendly and cooperative as I watched them work together as a team. The food was ridiculous large size portions and highly recommend the home style taters vs hash browns.. Omg they were so delicious! I had tasted the home style tater fries off of the plate of the person I was with..not to mention he ordered some biscuits and gravy.. Oh yeah they were also delish! My pancakes- wow it was like a flattened basketball they were so huge! But oh so fluffy!!! The waitress was a doll!! The manager was going around and making sure everything was going great for everyone.. Honestly A+ service and I totally recommend this place to eat!  We both ended up with to go boxes as we could not eat everything.. I challenge you to eat at The Place and see if you can eat everything! Honestly, you will get excellent service and tasty food!"}
{"text":"The customer service is great, the staff is very attentive and accommodating . The food is delicious, especially breakfast. The specials are usually good, plus they give a lot food for a great price.   I usually have French Toast, which is very yummy, but today I tried  \"the special\" which was a Bacon Quiche, it was a mouth full of deliciousness.  The rest of my party, had Build Your Own Omelets, now that's good eating.  This is definitely a frequent flyer spot."}
{"text":"Old fashioned breakfast.   Great for weekend meals.   Lots of seating.   Always packed.   Great fast service."}
{"text":"Let me tell you have to go to The Place and order the special French Toast. It's carrot cake and cream cheese. hmmm.  Add some maple syrup just to make it especially tasty sweet.  The sausage patties were tasty but greasy.  The eggs over easy was over medium. I am not being critical but giving a flavor of the place. Free wifi."}
{"text":"We're here 2 days in a row because it's so GOOD! I'm from LA and we need a \"Mike and Rhonda\" to come here!"}
{"text":"I ordered a steak medium rare, I got it well done. It's ok tho, accidents happen. 15-20 minute wait before checking how the food is. He asks me do I want another one? I replied No I have a dr. Appointment in 20 minutes. He says ok let me take this to my manager, then 10 minutes later she shows up with another one and says sorry babe this ones better and handed me a to go box. Reluctantly, I cut into it and this one is medium well. The server said I'll take it back again. I said no i don't have time, I really have to go. He brings me the bill and made no adjustment at all. I am 30 years old and this is the 3rd time I've ever sent something back. I don't like complaining, but to me this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"If you're a college student or have ever been one, you no doubt share the sentiment that a cheap college town eatery with big portions is a true diamond in the rough.  Something to be cherished, even something to be nurtured.  Such was the case during my time at NAU in Flagstaff when I could always rely on Mike and Ronda's to be open early and serve absurdly huge portions of grub on a college budget.  The food wasn't really anything out of the ordinary, but it was always the perfect cure for a hangover or a satisfactory cure for a desperately hungry college appetite.  In addition to their Flagstaff location, Mike and Ronda's has a new(ish) location in Glendale on the southwest corner of 51st Avenue and Bell.  Their Glendale place is an equally popular staple the Phoenix metro for many of the same reasons, though perhaps with a slightly more refined touch.  So a little background on my visit here.  I was volunteering to donate blood at work later in the morning and blood services strongly recommended I have a huge breakfast before my appointment.  My appointment was in the west valley so I needed to find a breakfast spot out there that (A) was open early, (B) has huge portions and (C) such that I wouldn't regret it later.  Mike & Ronda's pretty much fit the billing to a tee.  Their stand-alone location in Glendale is a couple of blocks west the corner strip center they used to be located in.  The aesthetics, while simple and unassuming, are a definite upgrade from their previous location.  And if you've been to their Flagstaff location, the one in Glendale will look like a 4 star steakhouse by comparison.  In reality, the Glendale location has the feel of super-sized Denny's or a Black Bear Diner on steroids.  With all that in mind, the menu will look plenty familiar to Mike and Ronda's Flagstaff patrons.  Perhaps the one dish that has been and remains the Mike and Ronda's staple with NAU students and their other regulars is their Hungry Man Special.  The description speaks for itself.  Three eggs any style, hash browns, choice of meat (sausage, ham or bacon), and a choice of toast, pancakes, or biscuits and gravy.  I took down the Hungry Man multiple times during my college days, but it's been over a decade since my last encounter with the Hungry Man.  Nevertheless I went with the same lineup I went with from back in the day.  Scrambled eggs, pancakes, sausage, hash browns, and a drink.  Total tab including tax and tip was about $15.  As expected, the portions were enormous (see my photo) and the food came out pretty quick.  The food was pretty much exactly I remembered.  Tasty and traditional.  It's not a breakfast that wows in flavor as much as it wows in portion size.  But for the price, I expected that.  I will say I've always liked Mike and Ronda's hash browns better than most places.  I think they're pretty liberal with the amount of butter they use to cook those on the flattop so that may be the key.  The eggs, sausage and pancakes were also good, but again nothing out of the ordinary (other than the portions).  But as an inexpensive, reliable breakfast option, Mike and Ronda's once again got the job done.  Despite the fact I was here at 6:30am on a Monday, the restaurant was still almost half full.  Having lived on the west side of town for a number of years, it doesn't surprise me that Mike and Ronda's has garnered the following it has.  It's cheap, it's a good value, the staff is fast and friendly, and the food is reliable.  It's not a place that will make you go OMG, but as a standard bearer for comfort food it's a solid home state institution."}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday morning and were pleasantly surprised. The food was very good, service was terrific and the place was clean. It's a little loud with hardwood floors and a log type ceiling. Had the biscuits and gravy and the biscuits were the largest I've ever seen, hands down. The gravy was delicious and the smoked sausage was terrific. Great central location for people in the NW Valley of Phoenix. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I do take out once a week for dinner. They have great dinners. The sad part is no one knows they even do dinner. The Saturday nite prime rib is the best we have had in years. The homemade meatloaf is awesome Keep up the great work guys. Love the dinners. Oh the breakfasts also great."}
{"text":"Love the place.  Large servings. Very large.  But their bacon is tied for first place with one other breakfast place.   The bacon here is GREAT!   Really all the food I have had is wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Excellent mimosas and diced breakfast potatoes! AND you can order food to-go :D"}
{"text":"They served me RAW pancakes twice and still want me to pay for them  They need a new manager who knows customer service.  I ordered a breakfast with eggs, bacon, diced potatoes, and pancakes.  I've been coming here for years and really like the pancakes here.  BUT! today I received pancakes that were no fully cooked with raw batter.  I told the waitress so she when to get me new pancakes.  The second pancakes were raw as well.   Waitress went to talk to the manager and came back with the full price of the meal.  She said the manager said I would have to pay for the eggs, bacon and potatoes so basically it's the same price . No half off or discount. I told her I want to speak to the manager, the waitress went to speak to the manager again and came back with two dollars off . I told her I wanted the manager.  After having a talk with the manager she refused to budge. I can understand paying for part of the meal  but don't insult me by taking two dollars off.   The manager finally came to her senses and comped my meal.   New manager please!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was a little kid. The food is always amazing and the service is excellent. I eat here every Sunday morning. I get the Corned Beef hash breakfast with over easy eggs and hash browns. It's always perfect. Every single time. It's amazing that for over a decade, I've always had consistent food and service. This is how you run a business. I've eaten at a lot of little breakfast joints around the valley, but I always seem to come back here. This is mine and my families go to place and always will be."}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant at 9:00 Saturday morning but they handled it very well,we received our meal very quick. The meal for the most part was very good. My wife had the multiple-grain pancakes and they were not completely cooked. The portions are very large and they use good quality ingredients I think because it was so busy they rushed things. A recommendation would be to up grade silverware, very cheap. I did like the syrup options with maple and blueberry and coming in the squirt dispenser bottles was a good idea.. I would definitely come back and would recommend breakfast."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in the valley!  I used to come here all the time when I lived in Glendale.  The omelets are great and the biscuits with gravy are one of the best items on the menu.  Sadly I now live across town, I will never find a breakfast place in the East Valley as good as this!"}
{"text":"Well let me start off by saying that the two front desk ladies that where there need to be more friendly and great the guest with a smile and make them feel welcome, because I didnt felt that. Also my male server needs to also be a bit more friendly and more attentive. So far I am not so happy with the service and on second thought my food was just nasty. Next time they should serve fresh fruit because the one I got was nasty. The only great thing about this place is the good service I got from Jackie, thank you for being friendly."}
{"text":"My least favorite breakfast place in the valley. Food is average at best. Customer service and choice is discouraged. Don't want a fatty potato option in your meal? Too bad, you can't substitute for something cheaper or pay for something more expensive. Never been to a breakfast place before this that didn't let you make it your way within reason.  First time here and last time here."}
{"text":"What can I say, Holly, our bartender fast and friendly! 16oz steak, cooked rare, was perfect. Came with eggs and toast $15.   I had a Godiva white chocolate liquor with my coffee, $6. That's a great price too, considering I usually pay $10 or $11.  When you eat here sit with Holly at the bar. By the way, they are so prompt on pouring coffee!!  Thanks again!!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great service and food.the employees are very nice and seem to enjoy their jobs. You can tell there are a lot of regulars-everybody was saying hi to each other. Huevos Rancheros was awesome!"}
{"text":"The portions are HUGE! Probably the biggest biscuits I've ever seen (I didn't order them). Amazing, fluffy pancakes and they give you 2 syrups. I built my own omelette and since I don't get any meat, they let me have extra veggies. It seems like it's a very meat centric menu but that's ok. They seem to work with you on things. It's a rustic lodge environment. Family friendly but also free flowing booze. There is a bar and counter with open seating. I'll definitely come back with friends and family. Now I'm going to finish \"m m m my mimosa\""}
{"text":"Love this place... excellent for the morning after bar hopping when you are too exhausted to even make yourself coffee.  And nothing beats good food for not much money.  Two people for 9.00... bring it on.  I have had the hungry man special, the two egg deal (which they recently increased their prices, probably due to demand because they are PACKED every time I'm in there, even during the week), their breakfast burrito and a couple of their omelets.  I haven't been failed yet.    The service is awesome, the menu is simple and easy to read and everybody seems friendly, and it's well lit.  A well rounded group of people are in there, from the senior citizens to the hungover tattoo artists I've seen.  I would definitely recommend... it's just like Mom's home cooking."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the customer service and couldn't help but feel like I was bother. From placing my name at the hostess booth, to getting a table, to placing our order felt like a big inconvenience to the staff here. Does not make a for a nice atmosphere to enjoy our food. I used to love this very popular breakfast spot but I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"If anybody orders to go were being charged. 45 for the box to put your food in r u kidding me just imagine if I went inside probably charge me to use there plate not satisfied at all."}
{"text":"There is nothing like homemade biscuits. They've got em and they look absolutely mahvelous. Had lunch with a large group of people and the place was rockin', but we got seated quickly and comfortably and were served drinks in just a few minutes. To tell the truth, there was a lot I wanted to try, but I ordered the Veggie sandwich as I always like to see the interpretation of this sandwich. I am not a vegan, just love veggies, and this one would have been perfect for me if it would have had red onions instead of white. I did request mayo instead of ranch but that didn't detract from the flavor so if you are a veggie lover and want to take your carnivorous friends someplace where you all can be satisfied, The Place is your place. My mates had big crispy chix fry with gravy, eggs, sausage, both types of breakfast potatoes, green chili omelletes,and of course, biscuits and gravy. The hot turkey san looked like it came from a NY style deli, piled high with the good stuff and quite honestly, we all pigged out, and came away very satisfied at a reasonable price. I'll be back for breakfast next time, and will come hungry."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hoopla is about. The food is average at best. Certainly not worth the wait. The owner has no respect for their employees."}
{"text":"I live in Flagstaff six months of the year and here in Phx the other six.  In Flagstaff, when tourists ask where to eat especially breakfast, they get sent to Mike and Ronda's The Place.  There are two in Flagstaff.  It was with some curiosity that my wife and I visited the Bell location this week.  We already knew to expect elephant size portions but would thefood be as good?  How about the service which is excellent in Flag.? The answer in a word is YES!  The portions are huge.  The service was excellent and the food was G-o-o-d.  Wifey had a hot sandwich au juice and I had a salad.  That salad had maybe a half to 3/4 lb meat and was delicious.  Simply delicious.  I thought that today, I could make a salad as well as they can. ...and I can...and you can.... but not for the price.  And you'd better be prepared to eat salad for a week if you try it yourself.  The place salad lasted me two entree size portions and a small dinner salad.  Wonderful. Service was quick and fast and friendly. Would go there, like in Flagstaff, in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy The Place. They have large portions and they are FAST, everyone is contributing to running food or refilling your drinks. I love the build your own omelette and they have lots of options. Their vanilla latte is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and large serving portions. Orange juice was delicious but pretty pricey for a no refill drink. Arrive early too as lines can get long, especially on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Portions the size of my head? Great diner concept!! Like any other all-American breakfast place, Mike and Ronda's has plenty of large tables, great service and and a diverse menu. If you live nearby, you should wholeheartedly keep this place in mind if your family is in town or if your kid's soccer team just won a game or something.  This menu is packed with so many options, I really had to spend some time trying to find out what I truly wanted for brunch. In this case, an open-faced burger. It was absolutely delicious. Sadly, the size of the meal was the only thing memorable about this place's food.   Also, word to the wise: don't order the grilled cheese if you plan on eating it as an appetizer. It's a full-on meal by itself!"}
{"text":"Our first time having breakfast here and our experience was excellent! Good food, good service and definitely good \"Bloody Marys\"!"}
{"text":"The breakfast was good, with portions aplenty for a decent price.  The food was a distant afterthought when not 1, 2, 3, 4.......actually I lost count......but more than 4 times we were interrupted by employees checking every condiment, shaker etc on our table.  Some of them twice.  Might check The Place out again in the future, but this experience doesn't exactly have me running back."}
{"text":"We're looking for a brunch spot and got excited about the reviews. Restaurant certainly offers Large portions and is priced nicely but unfortunately food is just ok. Initial server was quite nice, but we were handed off to one who was quite distracted. No greeting when he came to our table-just \"do you know what you'd like?\""}
{"text":"Food was delicious as always! But my waitress was a tad bit more rude compared to other visits! Yes they're very busy but yet she made plenty of time to visit and check on other tables just not mine I heard from her 4x place the order (mind you she didn't even get our drink order someone else did) drop the order and to give us the check! &  to return my debit card! We had to ask for a refill when she brought the check and she didn't even know what we were drinking smh"}
{"text":"Excellent Bloody Mary with extra spice to kick it up. Had the breakfast burro which was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! You would be hard pressed to finish drinking it all before the server came around checking if you would like more. The service really up beat and fast. I got one of the breakfast specials, the chili quiche, it was amazing. Breakfast was very filling. Totally would go again."}
{"text":"The Place was a definite 5 stars when I first started going a few years ago, however in the past year it has gone downhill.  The quality of food is no longer what it was.  The last three times I've ordered my eggs over easy and got them over medium to over hard.  Today my pancakes were cold.  The customer service has also gone downhill.  Too bad, I really liked this place."}
{"text":"Great place for B-Fast.  My family and I visited recently during our spring break trip.  We were greeted, seated and welcomed promptly.  The cinnamon roll to start was great.  The Jalapeno Gravy was delish.  The biscuits were HUGE.  My wife was all about her prime rib scramble and both kids enjoyed their meals.  My only complaint was I wish the hash seemed more house made.  It appeared to be hormel from a can - crisped up well on the flat top but left me wanting something a bit more scratch made.  Overall a great choice and one of our better options this spring break week trip.   Total tab was $50 for a family of 4.  D."}
{"text":"This place was one of my first brunches after moving permanently to the valley.. So its gonna rate high in my book irregardless:-) After going on and on about how Im disappointed in the lack of breakfasty type places in PHX .. My friend from PV said I know 'The Place'.. (teehee).. The Place was packed.. but we got a booth .. friendly service.. I got the perfect poached egg.. because that is pretty much the only way I will have my eggs.. and darnit.. they better be right!.. I split a buttery pancake with my friend; So I love this place.. I mean, umm.. The Place!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Greeters were rude, no basic acknowledgement. Server was nice and fast. $2.75 for horrible 8oz OJ from a $1.50 gallon. They can do better. Horrible eggs. Otherwise good decent food. My husband loved the fresh made biscuits and gravy. The pancakes were great. My sis-in-law loved her omlet. Would go back. Will try different items. Worth another try. :)"}
{"text":"The food taste better than homemade. It's my go to breakfast/brunch spot to eat. The customer service is on point. There is usually a 30 minute wait so I like to reserve my spot using the Yelp app. I highly recommend this place to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped here after church today. Portions were gigantic. Fairly reasonably priced. Food was good, but not gourmet. Just your run of the mill diner food. Service was excellent. I liked the full bar. I was able to have a Long Island with my food which was awesome and it was only $5. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love love love The Place! I just had their special. Which was an open face biscuit, eggs, lots of tinder brisket and jalapeño country gravy all over it! It was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Amazing as usual! The short rib sandwich was so good at lunch today. The tomato soup that came with it was too \"smokey\" but not bad. Service was great, as usual. The Place was busy. So glad you guys moved and have had even more success."}
{"text":"Love this place! They don't have any fancy food on the menu. It's just plain and simple food but done right. Their bacon is amazing as well as their corned beef hash. Although people raved about the biscuits and gravy, I didn't find anything special about them unfortunately."}
{"text":"I had lunch there on 09/16/16 with my daughter, food was ok a little overpriced-- .80 cents for ranch which we were not told there was a cost. But the BIGGEST Disappointment was the management. My waiter Jay was terrible we even commented this must be his first day., Terrible Service and when I asked to speak to a manger we had to wait for 10 minutes and he appeared and told me he was the manger and basically if I didn't like it not to come back.  I then as to speak to the General manger (who was sitting at the bar talking with the waitress and it was his first week there could  not take the time to talk with me.  I would NOT  NOT recommend this place to anyone.."}
{"text":"We were traveling for a martial arts tournament and wanted to find a breakfast place before we left Phoenix to head home.  Found \"The Place\" through Yelp and gave it a try.  In the time it took us to decide to go there, the estimated wait time went from zero minutes to almost 30, but through the Yelp app, The Place had the option to join the waitlist--love this feature!  We did, and headed toward the restaurant.  As we arrived, I was notified our table was ready.  We were seated immediately while others were walking in and being told they'd have to wait.  The dining area was laid out nicely.  Tables and booths, and arranged so that it wasn't too crowded.  We had a booth and it was comfortable.  My only criticism of atmosphere:  it was a little too warm inside.  The food was tasty.  I ordered the Chorizo Skillet, my wife ordered pancakes and my son ordered a waffle (no butter, no syrup).  Everything was tasty.  Although plenty warm, my skillet must have been prepared first and put under a lamp, or it was slightly overcooked.  Noticeable, but definitely not bad enough to send back.  My wife's and son's food was perfect.  Overall, for as busy as it was that morning, I have no real complaints, and nothing that would prevent me from going back again if I'm in the area.  Our waitress was busy but friendly and she ensured our glasses & coffee mugs were never empty.  The staff clearly had a team approach to service too, which added to the positive experience.  There were at least two other waitresses who came by to ensure we were okay, and at one point, one of the folks bussing tables stopped and asked if he could take anything out of our way.  Overall the service was everything you'd hope for in a restaurant like this.  The Place is in a free-standing building in the parking lot of a larger storefront, so parking was plentiful, all the way around the building.  Based on our visit, I recommend you get there early or use the Yelp app to get on the waitlist.  If you're in this part of Phoenix and you're hankering' for some breakfast, give The Place a try!"}
{"text":"I am a transplanted Midwesterner, so I love me some breakfast.  And by breakfast I mean:  Hashbrowns, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy.    Mike and Rhonda's makes a mean breakfast with huge portions.  For $7 you can have bacon/sausage/ham with hashbrowns, 2 eggs, and biscuits & gravy/pancakes/toast.  Come hungry or share.  They also serve classic american lunch fare:  burgers, chicken strips, fries, meatloaf, etc."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars because the wait staff, especially Danielle, were amazing. Happy, very knowledgeable. Also the biscuits were great and the freshly smoked vanilla, maple, & coffee bacon was HEAVEN!!! But everything else? Eh. It all tasted like it was dumped out of a can or frozen. The gravy and hollandaise sauce were both disgusting. It was very ok food. I think the people who rave about the eggs Benedict have never had homemade hollandaise. Probably will never go back."}
{"text":"This is Dec 9th,Saturday. This place closes at 2 or 2:30 pm. Daily. Had French toast bacon y eggs. Yeah, have eaten here several times before y the portion are decent size. Not skimpy, prices are not cheap but just about right. The food was pretty good y service was quick y polite. Wish they would not grab up plates when they think you are finished. Usually crowed but very noisy today! You will be alright if you choose to eat here. Happy Holidays to everybody."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Ty was amazing, as were all the bussers. For as busy as it was, the day before Father's Day, everything was terrific. I've never seen biscuits and gravy quite like these.  Yummy..."}
{"text":"Great service, good food & large portions for a reasonable value.  Our drink order was taken moments after we settled in and our food order was taken when our drinks were delivered.  Our food was delivered in about 10-12 minutes.  This time I ordered the Huevos Ranchero, which I've tried before when stealing food from my wife's plate on a prior visit. It was hot, fresh and yummy!   My wife got the Eggs Benedict which she said was very good and remarked the ham really stood out.  The wait staff was wonderful and there was always someone topping off our drink and seeing if we needed anything.  Furthermore, the staff is efficient and you never see any of them just milling around.  Although, not close to our home, we've been here about 6 times over the past year and never had a problem with the food or service."}
{"text":"Disappointed!! Been going to \"the place\" for some time now, and I think their food and staff have gone downhill. They moved to a bigger place only to serve more people and forgot about the food and service. I never had a bad experience until they move from the strip mall at 51st/bell to the vacant restaurant on the opposite corner. 1st time I went, I sat at a single table in the corner and my server forgot about me, and then they changed servers because they knew I probably wouldn't tip him. NO Apology at all! 2nd time I went my server forgot the gravy for my biscuit, not a big deal I know. The English muffin was grilled (ok, is the toaster broken?) but they used a press and it was thin as a pancake and hard. Why would you send that out?  I don't think I got 2 eggs and mentioned it to the waiter how said, \"Well I put in an order for 2\". The hash browns were tasteless and when I did get my gravy was disappointing. Not going here again."}
{"text":"This truly is \"The Place\" for quality American style diner food. Lunch and breakfast that is served until early"}
{"text":"Not much to say about it here. It's a very solid place for breakfast, but to be honest not much more than that. Nothing that wowed me.   Ordered biscuits and gravy that came with eggs, and it really wasn't bad but you could tell it was mass-production-made gravy (very floury). The biscuits weren't bad and neither were the eggs, but like I said, \"not bad\" really isn't impressive. Service was decent and friendly, atmosphere was somewhat cozy, decor a little dated."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST COFFEE I HAVE EVER HAD! Great breakfast place. We see lines every weekend. We had some time this week on a weekday. Great clean place, no wait for  a table at 9am on a Tuesday. The waitress was nice and attentive. Owner/Supervisor even came over to say HI Great place."}
{"text":"Always great and quick service! The portions are huge and light on your wallet!! Always a family breakfast favorite!! The wait is long but if you download the 'nowait' app you can reserve a spot in line!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee,  the hashbrowns were better than perfect, and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Came to breakfast this morning with my family. Food was really good. Yes something my mom would make but still very good food. Our waitress Samantha was really nice and attentive. Will return again but you should do something bout your rude Starbucks drinking pretty boy hostess. He is the reason I gave you 4 stars instead of 5"}
{"text":"Really good. Large portions, fast and friendly service, decent prices. This will not be out last time."}
{"text":"Honestly, I live right around the corner from this place. I have been eating here since high school and now I'm graduating college. This is the breakfast spot, I get the omelets or the breakfast burrito and they usually come with pancakes!!   The place IS always packed but it's never a long wait for a table. You get a great deal for your money, the portion size is definitely worth it and usually turns into two meals.   This was a 4-5 star review up until this point, and now they only get 3 from me.   The rude waitress thing is a problem for me. These high school girls with their ratted up hair and overdone makeup at 6 AM need an attitude check. More often than not I get a snooty, curt waitress who resents bringing me a clean fork or a fresh pot of coffee.   I don't care if there is gum under the table, that the food is greasy or that the blueberry pancake syrup is really colored sugar water; all I want is a polite waitstaff that doesn't roll their eyes at me.   Mike and Rhonda, I love you and it's nothing personal, but give me a better waitress and I'll give you a better review."}
{"text":"The food is good. Great atmosphere and very popular place. I brought my kids and I will say the only annoyance was with getting on the waitlist. I signed up through yelp, it was 20 minute wait, and I knew my kids would have problems waiting. I received the confirmation text, but when I got there they had no record. The staff did not seem to care and offered no solutions. Even though they had 2 parties of the same number that were not there when called them. Needless to say the kids did not the entire 30 minute wait.  I mean mistakes and glitches happen, it is how they are resolved that makes the difference."}
{"text":"The food is always good and comes out quick! We usually go during the week, so we never have to wait.  The two egg breakfast is cheap and is always more than enough food.  It's by far the best deal for breakfast in town."}
{"text":"Out standing service. We had a large group from the retirees of S.R.P. got us all in no problem. The food was good came out in good time and was hot. Everyone kept stopping by to fill drinks and coffee as well as checking on us."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and tasty! I am thrilled to have a NAU staple in my hood. Greasy spoon dining at its best in NorPho. It's almost always busy and that adds to experience. My wife, son and I can leave there stuffed for under $15. We hit The Place almost every week."}
{"text":"YUM! Food and service was great! BUSY BUSY BUSY on weekends!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming to Mikes and Ronda for years. The food portions are great. The food is excellent. Love the fact that you can make reservations on YELP app. Thanks David for the great service today."}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price. The service was okay but it was really busy. We received our drinks and food in less than 15 minutes. Overall this is a must try."}
{"text":"This is the best place for a great breakfast.  I originaly ate at the one in Flagstaff, AZ, and was quite surprized with the food. Fresh ingredients, cook to order, who could ask for more? Well  you will get more, the portions are huge, if you leave this place hungary, it's your own fault. The biscuts and gravy are very good, not your typical biscut more like a bread roll, but very flavorfull and fresh.  Looking online for a place to go to breakfast I was surprised to find this place close to my house. Very busy had a short wait when we arrived (where do you ever have to wait anymore) food proves why they are so busy. We ended up sitting at the bar, service was great and the other patrons were very nice. I felt like I was at a family breakfast.  Menu was the same as the one in Flaggstaff, AZ. They also serve dinner at the locations in the valley and a full bar, YEAH!!  I will be eating here more often now that I know its the same place."}
{"text":"We came from San Diego to see our Padres play, and we stop in since we were close by food was good came out fast no wait really I'm a bacon lover n the bacon was the bomb dot com. I would definitely come in again."}
{"text":"Decently big portions, got seated rightaway on a Saturday noon time, which was nice. Very nice servers and the manager came by to make sure everything is ok. Good experience overall!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast and it was absolutely wonderful. The food here is so delicious and the service was outstanding. There was a line when we went in and we were sat down within 15 minutes tops. They have giant home made biscuits and jalapeño gravy to kick off the meal. I also noticed that they have really good local beer here for lunch and dinner, they have stouts which is great because it's rare to find a restaurant that has good local stouts. If you come to eat here you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Always get in fast, foods always great, wonderful customer service. One of the few places I'm not afraid to order something different because it is always delicious."}
{"text":"So I love it. Not only can you get amazing food here, but you can get on the waiting list on YELP!  Great food, Good Service, OJ is a bit pricey.  $8.50 for a large.  A good breakfast place."}
{"text":"QUANTITY NOT QUALITY mostly NOT EDIBLE  The good- my ice tea and the pickle chips.  The bad- rye bread as thick as my thumb (rye bread should be thin) low fat  low quality corned beef that appeared to be previously frozen because of dark color but had added grease fat added to each side of each slice of meat that seemed to be mostly burger grease (because of the remnants of burger I found in my sandwich) and other assorted grease. The dressing was thinned down to a milky substance. The cheese used was processed not real cheese . The sour kraut had a few of someones grilled burger onions in it.   The salad was water logged and not drained and I had an inch or more of water in the bowl.  The waitresses all were sleeveless and that doesn't seem sanitary because of all that reaching everywhere how do you know if some deodorant or antiperspirant didn't flake off into your food?    My waiter seemed very rushed the whole time.  Felt sick to my stomach after here.  and on the way out I saw ketchup bottles on the patio tables outside that may have been opened and were possibly spoiling in the high heat outside.  I know most people only enjoy the fatty breakfast here since they are used to that  and that is cool . They are really large and most people I saw were LOVING that!"}
{"text":"First time visiting. Wasn't very impressed. Pancakes completely uncooked in the center. Food was pretty bland. Price was fair. Server never came to refill our coffee or waters or check on us until we were packing up to go. Pretty bummed because we recently moved to the area and are looking for a \"regular\" spot for the family to dine out. We will keep searching...."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast place. Only open for limited hours a day and normally packed.  Good luck getting in on a Sunday.  Good service and large portions."}
{"text":"The best breakfast joint in town, hence the constantly huge crowds every single day!  And they have a full bar with bar seating!  HUGE PORTIONS!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Eggs Benedict, best Hollandaise I have had. My boyfriend got the Pork Adabo special they had, it was amazing as well. We can't take off any points for our Bloody Mary's, cuz well, we are Bloody Mary snobs. We like it spicy and it wasn't near what it should of been but the boyfriend enjoy the pickled green bean it came with! Definitely can't wait to head over there again and try more!"}
{"text":"This place is good and very reasonable on the prices. I had the eggs Benedict with hash browns and a coffee. It came out to be around $13. The proportions are huge! The staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"First time being there food was really great... service on the other hand was not so great... but I'm going to assume that it was because its a bigger place so they had to hire new serves so I'm going to let that go... couple of things... if you serve someone coffee you should ask if they need cream and or sugar. and serve with a spoon... other then the service being a Lil lousy id say its a great place... and they did have a bar...but i will return there later to see if anything has changed"}
{"text":"Best biscuits and gravy in the West Valley!  Usually eat at this location on either Saturday/Sunday for brunch.  Always have great specials as an option to try for something different.   Service is always outstanding, with tables cleared quickly, drinks refilled promptly, and wait times short (for seating and food prep. - even with a line out the door). This restaurant is extremely well-run, and its popularity clearly reflects this.    If you're hungry for a great breakfast/lunch/brunch for a very reasonable price, this is \"The Place\" for you! :)"}
{"text":"I ate once at their old location and it was marvelous...and today we went to the new location.   The wait to get seating (table of 6) was about 25 minutes, but once inside, it was perfect.    It only took 15 minutes for all of us to be served and the food was amazing.   We all had to roll ourselves out the door.   Coffee was refilled very often.  The 6 of us fit cozily into a high-back booth, but it was okay.   The servers worked their butts off.    Fantastic biscuits (beware, they're BIG) and gravy, and my waffle with blueberry syrup was heavenly.   We went on a Saturday morning 11:00 ish."}
{"text":"The Place reminds me of one of those random diners you eat at while you're on a road trip. The restaurant is nothing fancy but the food is delicious. I ordered eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns with biscuits and gravy. If you are a crazy bacon lover you must come here to try their bacon it's the best! The Place is my new breakfast hot spot!"}
{"text":"Just in the mood for a new place to have breakfast, hit my yelp button. This place pops up. I had the steak strip breakfast. comes with two eggs, sirloin steak strips, hash browns, choice of pancakes, biscuit and gravy, or toast. this was one of my favorite plate I have ever had! Steak was very good, had a great taste seasoned very well. hash browns were cooked exactly the way I like them, crispy! The pancakes are the only reason I did not give a five star review, they are good, but I have had better and I prefer the thin pancakes over the thick ones. But I will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided to check it out.  Went this around 8:30am with my wife.  Portions are big but it's just regular breakfast.  They have a big mans breakfast for about $8.50 which includes 3 eggs, your choice of bacon, ham or sausage and bread or biscuits and gravy.  I have to say the biscuits are huge and fresh but the amount of gravy is enough or only one biscuit.  The gravy was also a bland and needed some work at least for me.  Overall a bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here but this time was exceptionally good.  I got a skillet with ham and sausage, and it came with biscuits and gravy. My BF got the same and we didn't even finish half but it was so good. Our son got the French toast and both our girls got pancakes and one got hash browns also, they all loved it.  The prices are great and the service was amazing.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First time eating here with my family. I always drive by but never went in because there are always people waiting outside. The wait today wasn't too bad. 20-25 minutes with 14 parties ahead of us. Great system for texting when ready and app available to see how many people are ahead of you. The staff was very welcoming and our waitress Kayla was awesome and attentive. The staff works well together as a team. Always coming by for coffee refills. They even offered drinks in a to go cup no extra  charge. Very impressed. Food was amazing and portions were large. Prices were affordable. My picky 6 year old ate everything!  We will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and service eggs a little runny still but over all I would recommend to anyone for a good portioned hearty better than ihop and dennys kind of food! I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I love this place! Breakfast is always huge no matter what you order & there gravey is homeade. Sooo good the hashbrowns are my favorite here they are crunchy on the outside & mashpotatoe like on the inside. I go here as often as possible. Very homey feel & the waitress&waitors are all great! Oh & the drink glasses are HUGE, the bring you a togo cup without you having to ask."}
{"text":"Right on the money every time.  Service is great and so is the food.  Taking reunion family there next week for breakfast cuz it's the best place around town."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the Best  This was the first time I visited \"Mike & Ronda's The Place\" based on the reviews of fellow \"Yelpers\". From the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted by a friendly staff member and you can't help but notice the cleanliness of the restaurant.   On this visit we had the buttermilk pancakes, eggs, toast, hashbrown and bacon All I have to say is, these pancakes were not only delicious but made perfectly, soft and fluffy on the insdide and golden brown on the outside, perfect! and the bacon was thick, but not too thick; crispy but not too crispy; once again, perfect,  tasty and delicious and the portions are huge. They even offered me an iced tea to-go after we paid the bill. This is exactly what I am looking for in a breakfast spot.  I look forward to revisiting \"Mike & Ronda's The Place\" again and try other delicious items offered on their menu."}
{"text":"Az omelette, hash, pancakes all delicious. Food makes up for subpar interior but what do you expect from a \"mom and pop\" operation. They at least tried, but who cares the food was great."}
{"text":"Love THE PLACE for breakfast with the family. Great food you'll be wanting to come back. Long lines so come early IT'S WORTH THE WAIT! I wanna thank all the employees you all are awesome I never have any issues when I dine here."}
{"text":"Best comfort food restaurant in Phoenix! huge portions, great food, great service, great prices. I really do not know why you would go anywhere else for breakfast. you can check in early with the \"NO WAIT\" app too. great way to go on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I don't know why anyone would eat or work here.  All the servers look high.  My wife swore she saw one of them getting high in the bathroom...another one throwing up.  The staff screams at each other and puts other servers down in front of guests..very unprofessional and disrespectful.  And what's with the owner??  Steroids maybe..save your money..eat someplace else"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. There was a line, but it didn't take too long.  It's pretty much traditional breakfast. Portions are large, food is hearty, and you won't leave hungry.   The few things that I thought were different or stood out was the bacon is sweet. I liked the meld between the inherent saltiness and the glaze or whatever they use to make it sweet.  The benedict has this creamy yellow sauce. It was really good.  The biscuits were a little overrated for me."}
{"text":"I've been to the place about twice before I went today. I woke up this morning craving pancakes and a Bloody Mary. I've never been disappointed with the food here and I've only heard people rave over the bloody Mary's and the pickled green bean garnish. My craving was more than satisfied, I almost have no words to describe how amazing just the smell of the homemade,melt-in-your-mouth pancakes were, with butter and syrup only. such amazing food and drinks that my boyfriend and I decided to make that our breakfast spot on our days off. very very happy customer!!"}
{"text":"When we came here, i was given the impression that the food was good. There was also a bunch of people in the door waiting so i got pump. When we got to our food though, i was so disappointed. The food is mediocre and my aunts cooking is way better. Their food are oily. No joke, no offence but take a bite and you will using those wipes alot because the oil are gonna stick at your lips. Now the good things, the steak was huge, the biscuit was big, and pancakes are large enough for 2 people. Also the bacon is good and thick. If I was given a chance i would pick another breakfast place. There was so little flavor to my order (steak breakfast) that i had to use so much seasoning, tabasco, ketchup, pepper, and salt.   This is only my review i lf you want to really try please do so. :)"}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner on a Saturday night. We ordered a chicken fried steak sandwich with fries and a tuna sandwich with soup/salad. The chicken noodle soup was bland and the salad had way too much dressing on it. The tuna was nothing different from the tuna salad I make at home. The chicken fried steak was just right on the sandwich. The waiter was somewhat helpful and food was served quick. Most of the reviews we noticed are during breakfast which might be different to the dinner menu. Maybe if we are willing to join the big crowds the weekend mornings we might have a different opinion."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a relaxed and comfortable diner, Mike and Rhonda's is the place. Literally. Prepare for a bit of a wait to be seated- but that should be a clue as to the food.   Super comfortable and cushiony seats and booths, bar seating, along with good comfort food and friendly servers.  Come hungry because the portions are big! If you're a breakfast fiend like myself, ask for the hash browns to be deep fried, extra crispy! Delish! Really everything is good, steak, salads, you name it. And did I mention they have hot chocolate? And a free refill of that coziness in a cup?!   The only thing that would improve the place is extended hours. Sometimes you just want breakfast for dinner."}
{"text":"Is there a better meal than breakfast? I think not... Any so, we have sort of made it a weekly tradition to have breakfast at The Place. My better half had eaten there prior to it moving to its new location, and I had never been there. She WAS NOT a fan of the previous location.   After looking at Yelp and the 4 stars reviews, I talked her into trying it again. And we are HUGE fans!   It starts with Mimosas and from there, it's breakfast bliss. The portions are HUGE, and the servers are friendly. Good food, but no real maple syrup. So, we bring our own.   It's a good experience."}
{"text":"This Place was a fantastic find for breakfast!  You will get more food on a plate than anyone could possibly eat.  They have specials (the day we were there it was a pancake special with apples or something that looked incredible).  They are open for breakfast and lunch.  They give you a free refill on your hot chocolate!  What other restaurant does that??  We had a group of 5 eating here and we all had great meals.  I have to say the best part of my breakfast was the biscuits that came as the side with my meal.  OMG they were amazing!  They were huge and fluffy and delicious!  I would like to try the breakfast potatoes instead of the hashbrowns next time as I felt my hashbrowns were not crispy enough, but that would be my only complaint.  I had diced ham and scrambled eggs and they were really good!  My aunt said their oatmeal was great also.  Not one person had a negative comment and when you're eating with my family, that is an impressive accomplishment!!"}
{"text":"Go here at least once a week sometimes more. But today was horrible service wise. Don't think we will be returning anytime soon. I would like to tell you our waitress name, it was on the ticket but since I had two of them (both horrible) and only one name I don't know who was who!!! One of them finally checked on us when we were almost done eating. And when I mean check walks by and says are we good and kept moving. The other one finally came over when she saw my card on the table to drop of the check. Then asked if I needed a box. If we do return I will make sure not to get either of them.."}
{"text":"This is one of the better breakfast places in the valley. The service is always good and I can't think of a single time that I have been there and had a bad meal. The breakfast menu has about everything you could want on it, and there is nothing to crazy or fancy, so it is not an intimidating list.   The lunch menu is also pretty good, just in case you are not in a breakfast mood. There is really no way to go wrong here."}
{"text":"Taste wise, I would go closer to a 3.0-3.5, but service and price definitely move me to bump this rating up to a 4.0. I went in on a random weekday around 1:00 pm to grab some food. The place was busy, but not crazy packed. I opted to get one pancake and some breakfast potatoes. Warning: the pancakes are HUGE. I am so glad I asked for a single pancake because there is no way I would have been able to finish a short stack at all. The breakfast potatoes were well seasoned and a yummy contrast to the pancake. I definitely had some leftover food that I had to box and take home. *Ask for to go syrup packets because they do have some!*  Service was friendly and our food came out at a good pace so thumbs up for that. Also we paid roughly $12 for two pancakes and two orders of breakfast potatoes which in my mind is a great steal. Drop by if you are in the mood for some classic breakfast/brunch dishes without too many frills."}
{"text":"\"There is no place like the place\" This is correct. If you are a soon to be dentist with a hippocritical sweet tooth problem this is not THE place. But for people who don't believe sprinkles should be the only condiment on the table it is good and affordable."}
{"text":"Great food great people! Very affordable! Mike and Rhonda got it right on this one! The service is super fast and the place is huge! Don't worry if you see a wait outside! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We used Yelp's waitlist feature at this popular breakfast place and walked right in when we arrived, past a lobby full of waiting customers. Great fun! Our server David was prompt and pleasant. We ordered corned beef hash and the special omelet of the day. Everything came out as we ordered it. It was tasty and portions were generous. We even had enough left over to warrant taking it home!"}
{"text":"Usually come here for breakfast and it's always good. Came here today and you guys \"ran out of bacon\"? How do you primarily serve breakfast and run out of bacon??? HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"The wait time in a Saturday morning was about 30 minutes and the food was worth the wait. Definitely a locals hangout. Not a place to come and chat as it was to loud to concentrate but like I said the food was wonderful. I had the special, open face biscuit with brisket, eggs and jalapeño gravy along with fresh squeezed orange juice. Every bite was a winner and it melted in my mouth."}
{"text":"Went here once and, although a lengthy wait on a late Saturday morning, once seated, the food and service was reasonably good. Portions are large, but the flavor of our breakfast (scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns and biscuits) was unremarkable in every sense. The coffee was hot; I'll give them that much. The waitress, however, seemed annoyed and preoccupied with matters other than her attention to our needs, but I chalked that up to the place being extremely busy. Everyone has a bad day from time to time.  About ten days later I thought I'd give The Place another try, but on a Thursday morning. As expected, it was only moderately busy. I opted to sit at the bar, though. I had to ask the bartender for a breakfast menu, and that was fine. What was not fine was the attitude she displayed. There was one, ONE other customer at the bar! I was polite and even tried my hand at making small talk about the weather. She had absolutely zero interest in my small talk, my order, or making the slightest effort towards a smile or pleasantries. Anyway, after she FINALLY pulled herself away from one of the younger male employees, whom she was obviously flirting with, she found the time to take  my order. The food was okay, but her lack of attention to her job, her apparent disinterest about me AND the only other fellow at the bar, probably made my meal taste worse than it was. When the check was mercifully and finally delivered, I walked over to the cashier to pay the bill. The inattentive bartender actually walked over to the cashier's desk and peered over to see if I was going to pay the bill!!! I was dressed down; certainly not looking my best. But the absolute unmitigated gall of her!!! She thought I was going to skip out on a sub ten dollar meal! Never, let me repeat, NEVER will I set foot in The Place again! Two strikes, you're out! Horrible place!"}
{"text":"New location and is this ever a place I want to invest in!  Its hard to not order breakfast as it is sooo damn good here but \"The Place\" now has a very credible dinner menu and next week we are off to give our favorite breakfast joint a try for dinner.  Gorgeous new digs and the same high quality of food and service from some very hot chicks!"}
{"text":"The wait seems like it would be worse than it is, they're pretty good at keeping it moving. The staff is fun, friendly, and attentive. Josh was our server and we really enjoyed him! They work well as a team, communicating and complimenting each other. We have a 1 1/2 year old that we were dining with and they made the experience very pleasant! Not to mention the food was great and we left stuffed!"}
{"text":"2.5-3   I really wanted to love this place!   Good morning Veterans day, YAHOO day off for teachers! My boyfriend suggested we get breakfast to celebrate not having to wake up at 5am. He suggested some of our usual favorites (Kiss the Cook, Black Bear diner, etc...) but I have really been slacking on my yelping and wanted to try something new and delicious. I consulted my friends at YELP and was SO excited to find what I thought would be another hidden gem only a few miles from our place...   We got there around 10:45 and the place was PACKED! This made us very excited because usually a packed place = solid food, solid service. We had a tiny wait and had a great little booth spot. After about 5 minutes our server...for the sake of kindness, lets call her grouchy girl...flew over and literally threw menus at us. Not cool. She then came back for our drink order and seemed greatly put-out by our request for water with our coffees. Sorry for that extra 36 seconds we requested from you grouchy girl.   The menu looked great! I love the simple idea of creating your own omelet. I had an egg white omelet with chicken (had never done this before and loved it!), tomatoes, spinach, onion, avocado. The omelets come with all kinds of greasy starchy goodness which I turned down for a bowl of fruit. Grouchy girl clearly did not like this choice. My boyfriend went with the waffle breakfast with bacon and scrambled eggs. He enjoyed the waffle and bacon but the eggs really did look bizarre.   Looking around the room I noticed a lot of biscuits and gravy...maybe this is where we went wrong but either way, I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Super cool place for laid back types... you can tell this place has it's regulars. I loved that it had a diverse crowd and a welcoming environment. The staff was definitely on it's toes for lunch time and they didn't miss a beat!   I heard this was the place to go for breakfast, but since I came here for lunch I ordered the chicken fried chicken sandwich and it hit the spot. I love that this place is tucked away yet seems to not have any trouble getting business. It's pretty close to work so I'm sure I've got a new place to hit up for grabbing a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I came into The Place with my boyfriend yesterday for my birthday brunch. Because I turned 21, we chose this place because they had a bar. There were multiple girls helping us even though they weren't our waitress, which was nice. They brought over my first mimosa ever and it was great. Then they took our order and soon all the food was on the table. I decided to get their build-your-own omelette and OMG. It was delicious! They even put sour cream IN the omelette! Now we understand why this place seems to always be so busy!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place hasn't put all the Dennys' and iHops out of business. The food is real and fresh. Try it, you will know exactly what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Mike & Rhonda's \"The Place\" for years. Having attended NAU I was introduced to Mike & Rhonda's almost 20 years ago (insert hacking sound referencing length of time).  They are consistently good. Portions are HUGE and easily make for a nice take home meal. The food isn't outstanding, but it's good and the service is remarkable considering that they are almost always full to the gills.  This is the perfect spot to take yourself after imbibing a little too much the night before or after church when you are being good."}
{"text":"The food is always good here. I have been eating here for ever even when they were just in flagstaff. They did change their biscuits a few years back and they are not as good."}
{"text":"NEVER coming back here again! All my friends have been talking about how good \"The Place\" is and all this great talk about how the food tastes.. so I decided to try it out with my family. Took us about 25 minutes to get sat. We ordered food came out at a normal speed, they were pretty busy. Everyone at the table ordered hashbrowns and each one of ours came out RAW it was disgusting! My father even asked for his crispy... we tried to find our waitress who was very rude but we couldnt she never came back for refills some other waiter did. so when we finally saw our waitress we were finished with most of our food we told her all of our hashbrowns were raw and all she said was \"oh you should have told me so I could've put it back on the grill\" then took our plates and walked away.. didnt offer to get a manager or anything. all of our hashbrowns were still in full size we didnt eat any of it. whatever, we asked for a manager but one never came...awful customer service and the food is so-so, save money and go to denny's. Im a server at a sports bar so I know the industry very well and I'm so disappointed in the rude waitress and customer service, food was alright but not all that great. hope this helps! wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.."}
{"text":"Love the feel and vibe of the place! It's very woodsy like a cabin! Breakfast was really good! Very busy but overall pleased!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and the stars have dropped! It's a cute little niche in the city world but today our waitress was sick  my cup had to be replaced due to food on the outside and then they over cooked steak and over seasoned the remake plus the meat tasted old soooooo different from the amazing stuff I had last time here."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast! Lots of food, be prepared to not finish or take leftovers home. Great service, servers are super attentive"}
{"text":"Quick fast and good.   I had the standard 2 eggs, toast and hash browns with a slab of Ham.   Eggs = Cooked perfectly Toast = buttered well Hash Browns = Not cooked as much as i prefer (and asked for) but were good Slab of Ham = nice huge hunk, cooked until caramelized a little on the slab nice!  Staff was quick and service was on point."}
{"text":"I almost always have a great experience here! The food has never disappointed & the portions are very generous. MOST of the time the staff is very friendly and if you show up on the weekends for breakfast, do expect a wait but you shouldn't be disappointed.   Today, however, the service from my waitress Brittany wasn't great, I'd honestly give her a D+ at best, she wasn't rude by definition but she was very impersonable, she was more of an order-taker than a person of service, she'd walk by and look but really wouldn't even ask if all was good or if we needed anything, she never even stated her name(I got it from the receipt)... I needed her a few times and had to like waive her down or signal her over. I felt like my boyfriend and I were just inconvenient to her and she was JUST there to do her job, nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"We went to \"The Place\" ~ Mike and Rhonda's The Place this morning for breakfast.  They were very busy so we had to wait a while before seating.  The smell was amazing so our anticipation of well prepared, hearty breakfast full of deliciousness grew with each minute as we waited.    Service ~ The first thing we noticed was their servers were working at \"warp speed\" keeping everyone satisfied with their meals, coffee and drink refills!  They were helping each other so much it was difficult to tell which server had which table = AWESOME TEAMWORK.  They were a well oiled machine that seems to understand the importance of not letting a coffee cup run dry.  Our server was exceptional and will look for her again!  Food ~ Our meal was well prepared and very good.  Their eggs, bacon and sausage were cooked well and tasted good.  We really liked the top layer of our hash browns but found the bottom layer undercooked and lacking flavor and needed more seasoning.  The spinach and cheese omelet was good but would have been better with a light sauce over the top.  Their biscuits are more of a hybrid dinner roll/biscuit.  These things were huge and tasted OK.  The gravy was very disappointing with very little or no meat and was very plain.  I plan to order their chorizo burrito or omelet on my next visit.   I can see why this place is so busy.  They know how to cook a hearty breakfast that taste good so you should give them a try."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I recommend this place to everyone. Their chicken fried steak is amazing and their biscuits are huge"}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant and I was definitely impressed and satisfied with their curtious and friendly service. I ordered the hungry man specials and my eggs were a perfect over easy and the pancakes were fluffy and moist with warm maple syrup. My sister ordered the chicken breast sandwich crispy and raved that it was delicious. Our server was awesome and so friendly with his attentive service. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"What a waste of time and money. First off, when you tell the guest it will be 30 minutes then be more accurate. We left and drove up the street to run an errand while we waited and 9 minutes later we get a text message that our table is ready. So we did a quick U-turn to get back to find another parking spot to get our table before it's given away. I ordered two eggs over medium, hash browns and English muffin. Pretty simple in my opinion. Well the two eggs were \"snotty\" the clear whites not completely cooked. OM means cooked with a runny yolk, the plate had bacon on it, which I didn't order so she took it back. The has browns were cooked \"brown\"on one side of the pile and mushy white on the other side. I know you are busy, but the customer that waits, wouldn't know if the cook had to take an extra 2 minutes to finish cooking the food before it's plated. Get it together! Breakfast isn't that hard to make!"}
{"text":"I ordered a breakfast and it was okay. The service was good but I was expecting more out of the quality of the food. The hash brown and eggs were bland (flavorless). It just goes to show that you can't always trust yelp ratings."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Make sure you are either part of the early crowd, or come after 12pm because the wait is long on the weekends, which is understandable because the food is really good. This is actually my daughters favorite breakfast joint. I take her as a treat and we always have a good time. The waiters and waitresses are all very nice and actually check up on you and make sure everything is as you ordered it.  My kiddo and I usually order the same things, but of the few different breakfast items I've ordered, everything was flavorful and the serving portions are HUGE so it's easy to split food with someone. I also always get a big surprise when I get my bill, because it's always cheaper than I think it would be! :)"}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:30 am on a Sunday and the line moved quickly. Overall, the service was efficient and friendly. Only issue with the service is our waiter returned to our table twice before remembering to bring the to go box requested. I had an omelet which, to my taste, was rather dry...perhaps a tad overdone. The rye toast was thick and yummy buttery, the diced potatoes crisp, seasoned perfectly and delicious. My BFF had the smothered burrito with hash browns. He loved every mouthful and couldn't finish due to the generous portions. Coffee was fresh and service was prompt with refills. I appreciated that regular coffee was in a brown mug and decaf in a white mug. It really helps the servers. I've been here a few times and would return. Won't get another omelet, though. To be fair, I didn't order it lightly done."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in town!!  So glad that I don't have to go to Flagstaff for some good food."}
{"text":"Some D*MN GOOD BISCUITS! Great, fast, friendly service. Popular but not a long wait, even if the line's long, whether you go as a party of 4 people or 9 people (we did both). Pancakes are the only thing I wouldn't recommend... Consistency is rubbery and tough, like it's from a pre-made mix. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've never been here before but few days was my first time. It was Saturday around lunchtime and it was busy and loud. I give it 3 because the food and service was good but I couldn't have a normal inside voice conversation with my family at the table due to everyone talking, employees running around, and dishes clanking. however I would come back here during a not so busy day."}
{"text":"The boyfriend took me here for biscuits and gravy. Hands down best biscuits and gravy ever! Portion sizes are perfect. Atmosphere is nice and all the staff was welcoming and a pleasure to deal with."}
{"text":"If you like quantity over quality, this is the place for you. The food is mediocre at best. I ordered the 2 eggs, hashbrowns with a side of pancakes. It was a lot of food for only $5, but the large portions with cheap prices is the only thing they have going for them. My bf got the chicken fried steak, which he could not finish becuase it was too fatty. We were really looking forward to the biscuits and gravy after reading the reviews. However, we were very disappointed, as they completely lacked any flavor.   If you are looking for good quality food, skip this place."}
{"text":"Whenever we are out for breakfast, this is our place. Huge portions, reasonable prices and the best bacon EVER."}
{"text":"This is the best place (on this side of town) for a good, hearty breakfast, decent coffee, full bar, and fast, friendly service. I love to share a big breakfast with my hubby, family, and friends.  The atmosphere is casually comfortable. There is a little  2 person table that offers 10% off your entire bill..if you dare to sit there ;). I do. A little discount always tastes better and makes for a fun photo too."}
{"text":"5 stars for super fast and friendly service!  Food quality exceeds the price.  Leave the kids at home......please.  BTW....got tattoos and looking for a gig?  Swing by."}
{"text":"Excellent food.   I get Huevos Rancheros to go a lot and the pork green chili makes this dish outstanding.  I've seen prices creep up in small increments over last few years, which is to be expected, and didn't bother me.  Today they charged me .45 cents for a to-go box.   I find this pretty tacky and worthy of a 2-star deduction."}
{"text":"Always great service and great food. The somewhat new location is cool too. Love love it"}
{"text":"fantastic family place.  pretty busy on a Sunday but they flip the tables pretty quickly.  staff always friendly.  the polish skillet and multigrain pancakes were amazing. their biscuits big and fluffy.    my grandson lived his cheese burger. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My family and I eat at this restaurant often. Great place for breakfast. The portions are fairly large and could often be split. Just about everything that I have had there has been pretty good. It gets pretty busy on the weekends and the wait times can be pretty long. No fault of the restaurant though. Just goes to show you how popular the place is."}
{"text":"I frequented The Place for a few years every Sunday for breakfast. I have to say it can be hit or miss after going regularly. They have good days and bad days. When they are on their game the food is amazing, and when they are off...well they are off. Some of the wait staff has been there since I started going. Overall they do have a lot of turnover and some waiters are better than other. I think of it as this: there are not many places to get a decent breakfast where you get a lot of food, the wait time isn't horrible and the prices are extremely reasonable. The Place has a large and varied menu and I think it is the best breakfast menu available. The waffle breakfast is good and is my go to. You get a huge waffle, eggs, your choice of potatoes and meat. The biscuits and gravy is very good but I suggest the half order if you don't eat a lot because you get a lot. They also refill your coffee the whole time you are seated. Get there early on the weekend though because by 9 am it is pretty packed and the wait can be a bit crazy"}
{"text":"I knew I was going to like this place from the start.  They open at 6AM for breakfast and there were several pickups in the parking lot when I got there about 6:20 on a Saturday.  I was quickly greeted by a seated server busy texting before her shift started and invited to sit anywhere.  She looked up and noticed I was reading the chalk board with the specials and mentioned that board was not yet updated.  I grabbed a small booth even though I prefer tables but I didn't want to take a 4 top by myself on a Saturday.  That early I should have taken a table as there were still plenty by the time I left.  Tim greeted me quickly and got my cup of decaf coming and took my order.  This mornings special was a well executed eggs Benedict with choice of potatoes ($7.99).  The potatoes lacked any grease but that kept them a bit on the flavorless side, cannot please everybody I guess.  I like this place.  Rock music at a decent level.  Friendly service.  My cup was never empty.  My meal was up less than a minute before it was brought to my table.  The acoustics are a bit loud, even at about a third full the conversation noise level was fairly high.  A very high 3."}
{"text":"The biscuits are huge, fluffy, and delicious- if this review was solely based on that, I'd give it 5 stars. However, the other food fell short. I ordered the Eggs Benedict. Simple, right? My dish came smothered in so much hollandaise sauce that I couldn't see anything on the plate underneath the sea of yellow slop. It was so salty and processed it reminded me of the taste and consistency of gas station nacho cheese. The prices are very fair, don't get me wrong. The bacon was very thick and flavorful too. However, I don't think I'd come back here for anything other than the biscuits and gravy"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight at 5pm. There were only a few other people dining in the restaurant. Were were told to sit wherever we like. We had to really look before we found a clean table. Funny thing, there were several servers standing around at the counter talking and really doing a whole bunch of nothing. Our uninspired server asked for our order, took our order, delivered our order and dropped the check without saying more than three words to us. We ordered a Patty Melt, Chili Size and Onion Rings. I asked the server if the Onion Rings were made fresh in the restaurant or frozen. He said fresh. The Onion Rings were frozen. The food portions are large but the quality is just ok. No big deal it's true you get what you pay for. Our main reason for giving this restaurant only two stars was the poor service and cleanliness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We went back on a Sunday afternoon at the \"NEW\" & bigger place.  We got a quote of 30 mins for a table. Since there was 2 of us, we decided to sit at the counter for no wait.  Our server greeted us quickly and took our drink order.  Our drinks came and he took off quickly.  He came back 5 mins later and took our food order.    We both ordered the Chicken Fried Steak served with hash browns, eggs, and instead of toast I got french toast.  The chicken fried steak was good, the country gravy was spot on.  The hash browns and eggs were good too.  The french toast was meh...  I should have gotten the pancakes.    The server came back to give our check.  He did not come back to see if things were ok.  They service seems to be more dis-engaged this time around."}
{"text":"Good food and big portions but not blown away which I kind of expected with the long lines.  Better than Dennys and IHOP but I prefer Fast Eddies and Black Bear personally."}
{"text":"Just had the best breakfast again. It's usually busy but so worth the wait. We have been here maybe 5 times and would go more but I hate waiting for a table. Sometimes we get lucky and sit at the bar/counter. I love that I can treat myself to a Bailey's and coffee too. Our  service is always incredible but Our server todayMike was above par to say the least. Fast, friendly and Actually seemed liked he loved his job. This place is doing everything right!!! A treasure in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Mike and Rhonda's is where it's at. Generous portions, good prices, friendly wait staff and DELICIOUS food. We try to make it here for breakfast at least a couple times a month. We've tried many different things and have NEVER been disappointed. I highly recommend the corned beef hash. It's awesome! One thing I also appreciate are their large drink cups. No sitting and waiting with an empty cup, although the staff would be on top of it if it were empty. Come out and enjoy an awesome, quick, inexpensive breakfast at The Place!"}
{"text":"If you can manage to not order a breakfast item(very good breakfasts!!!), the burgers are huge and yummy, the \"hot sandwiches\" with potatoes and gravy remind you of eating at Grandma's house, and the salad is fresh!  I don't think you could lose here!  Biscuits?  I've never seen such big biscuits!"}
{"text":"And this was a nice discovery in the neighborhood or city of Glendale. It is a very popular local spot. It has a great atmosphere, it's well run, and has great service. I would definitely come back to this place if I was in town. I ordered the multigrain pancakes with bacon and eggs and diced potatoes. It was a busy football Sunday and I think they must make the pancakes in batches because mine were warm, at best. I'm sure I could've told the server what was going on and they would've gladly fixed it but I was hungry and they were good even at that temperature. I'd read all these things about the diced potatoes and it turns out they're just pre-made diced potatoes from US foods the food vendor in town,  nothing special. The eggs were cooked perfectly over medium. The bacon which wasn't hot either and is thick cut and delicious.  Overall my whole meal could've been about 20° warmer and maybe they would've gotten four stars. Maybe."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed just average. Pre packages potatoes & hash browns  nice atmosphere  gd waiting staff seemed well organized."}
{"text":"Only got a star bec I couldn't give zero. The managers are rude, and talk to the hostesses and wait staff abusively. I can't imagine why anyone would work for them and take that abuse. I watched in horror as they got in a young woman's face and screamed at her. I wanted to get in his and do the same and decided against it. I instead went up to her and told her she deserves to be treated better and to quit, and to file a complaint against them. Worst company ever. Absolutely horrible place."}
{"text":"The place. I would recommend the spicy bloody Mary and Bacon! All the other food is great as well!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed breakfast here. The portions are huge.....but the quality of the food is quite good. We had the huevos rancheros with hash browns and the breakfast steak with pancakes.   The steak was cooked very well and really juicy. Whoever was working the grill knows what they are doing.   The huevos were also very good and we really liked the green chile. It wasn't very spicy but it had great flavor.   Pancakes were fluffy and tasty.   The service was fast and friendly and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything about the portions and the friendliness is great. Last time I went to eat breakfast the pancakes were so rubbery I couldn't cut them, I sent them back they bring me new ones less than a minute and they are the same. I think they make them and then microwave them which make them rubbery and terrible to eat. I know this is a huge restaurant and maybe will take too long to make pancakes for everyone, but quality is a must."}
{"text":"Solid. The Place is super solid. You cant go wrong with any of the food here. The kids menu is very good, my boys love the Mickey Mouse pancakes with apples on top. The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby! The shaved prime rib sandwich is insane. My wife always gets the same, eggs benedict with hollandaise sauce. She loves it. We all love their hot chocolate with fresh whipped cream and they give you one refill for free! Nobody does that with hot chocolate! The Place is highly recommended. Thanks for doing it right."}
{"text":"This spot is generous with their foods! Large portions and amazing breakfast! Waiters are always in a great mood and you feel welcomed. Has never disappointed me! Would recommend to anyone looking for just a breakfast spot! Cheap and delicious is what I like!"}
{"text":"So what can i say about The Place? If you have not brought yourself and your family here you are missing out. My boyfriend and i both got the chicken fried steak and eggs. My boyfriends eggs were cooked perfectly and when asked if i wanted diced potatoes or hash browns, i told our server josh(who  by the way is a frigging rockstar) to surprise me. Heck my plate had half and half... What a wonderful server Josh is. I have never had a 5 star experience here but today... Josh made it so."}
{"text":"Grew up on Mike and Rondas in Flagstaff.  Its awesome to have one here where I live now.    I cant really tell you about anything there but the Steak Strips with Eggs meal, because thats all I ever get.  I'm addicted to it.  I'm a simple guy that doesnt care for the frills, just a place to sit, a clean table and good service.  If you want real food cooked with plenty of love, this is your place to eat."}
{"text":"One of those places that has EVERYTHING on the menu plus some. The service is always good. The wait is a little bit out of control on the weekends but they do offer a yelp checkin so you can skip the line when you arrive."}
{"text":"Love going to this place for breakfast for a few reasons.  1) It is not a chain restaurant! 2)The portions are insanely huge and the prices are great! 3)The food is awesome. 4)All of the servers have worked here forever and are awesome at their jobs.  If you are in North Glendale you need top make a stop in. They also have a location in Flagstaff!"}
{"text":"I LOVE The Place. We chose to go on a Saturday morning, so of course there was a wait of 25-40 minutes. However, they text you when your table is ready and you can even track how many tables are ahead of you through Yelp. So that's cool and made up for the long wait time. The only reason I'm giving 4/5 stars is the price. The food is AMAZING! But the price goes up more and more every time I come. I've been coming to the place since I was in high school when it was located across the street. Knowing it's going to cost $50 for my family of 4 to have breakfast there always lurks in the back of my head and makes me reconsider coming at all."}
{"text":"My favorite omelet lives here :) It's my own personal build your own combination of chorizo, pepper jack cheese, onions, bell peppers & sour cream. PERFECTION!  I remember the coffee tasting better, then I added sugar & it was transformed back to a great cup of coffee. I haven't added sugar to coffee in years, but I think here I'll make an exception, lol.   This location is a lot larger than the previous one. Having no waiting was a nice change!"}
{"text":"You might have to wait, but it will be well worth it. The food is amazing and the portions are humongous! We typically eat breakfast so I cannot comment on lunch items. The biscuits are the size of a large man's fist. The bacon is just so delicious. They have homemade muffins as well. Try this place out. You will be very happy that you did."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on a Friday morning and it was pretty fast to get seated for a group of 6. There are plenty of breakfast options to choose from. The portions are big and the food is decent. I got the hungry man special and was able to switch the toast option for gluten free toast. So it's a definitely a plus that they have gluten free bread options."}
{"text":"This \"Place\" is FANTASTIC!! The home made food and dessert pies are amazing! It's one of the few places in Phoenix that knows how to make the perfect Eggs Benedict. They have one of the best BLT sandwich I've found anywhere and even the Pancakes are delicious and perfectly made with care. The staff takes pride in their work and it shows! Every time I've visited, the staff has been VERY friendly, warm, and offers excellent customer service, especially Aceland and Kylee who went out of their way to make me feel like \"part of the family\". When I'm on this side of town, it's a real treat to stop here for great food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. By far the best breakfast spot in the Valley. The biscuits are huge too. The servers are always great as well."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast! This place is always packed no matter when you go. We got there at 8am an there was a 15 minute wait. Service was awesome and personable. Food was good but I only gave it 3 because my over medium eggs were very runny and not cooked well. Whites should be firm. Pancakes and kids meal were great. We will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I always enjoyed the food at The Place at their previous, smaller location, so we were happy to hear they expanded into a larger restaurant.  We were also pleased that they were open for dinner most of the week, so we went in to have breakfast for dinner (they do have a dinner menu, but they serve breakfast all day, so, heck yeah.)  Long story short, I got the steak and eggs breakfast a 12 oz steak, two eggs, hashbrowns, and pancakes. For twelve bucks. I likemy hashbrowns well done and unlike most places, the waitress listened and they were great.  The steak was outstanding, I believe it was a sirloin. A 12oz steak for $12 bucks?? You can't beat that, I don't care what it comes with.  The staff was great, the restaurant was clean, everything was top notch. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great place to bring the family. Went with my wife and our 6 yr old for breakfast. You know it is going to be good then they have \"Mickey Cakes\" on the kids menu. Any time the young ones are able to be kept happy with their meal is a good meal out.  My wife had the biscuits and gravy. Make sure you are HUNGRY if you get the large size. Way to much food for her but she loved them.  I had a basic meat (bacon) and eggs. Also came with potatoes and another side. I went with pancakes and the potato wedges. Yummy.  Price was right and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with a friend and to catch up. I had a breakfast burrito with chorizo with a side of fruit. The portion was smaller than I expected but I was surprisingly happy about this as I think we are over served at most restaurants and end up with a ton of leftovers. My burrito was pretty good. The service was wonderful as my coffee cup was rarely empty, and this was a day I decided to drink A LOT of coffee.  My friend and I had a lot of catching up to do so we were there for an extended time. I never felt pressured to leave or uncomfortable about staying. It was a nice experience.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"We found this to be a very good basic food restaurant. I had a chicken fried steak with white gravy and mashed potatoes. All of it was freshly cooked. I husband had a Reuben sandwich with bean and rice soup.  we always compare any Reuben sandwich with the one we get at the restaurant on the top of Mount Lemmon. He said this one was right there in the same area - really good.  We already have picked out what we want next time. The place is very bright, very clean and the waitstaff were super nice.   My husband said the gravy on the chicken fried steak was so good he could eat it with a spoon. In fact, he added some of my smashed potatoes and did eat them with a spoon."}
{"text":"Was on the west side for my daughter's soccer game and looking for a breakfast place. So glad we found The Place! Put my name on the waiting list via Yelp on our way there and got a table within minutes. Thankfully, we saw someone with a cinnamon roll on our way to the table... delish!! Super friendly servers and great food."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  Loved the hash browns most!!  service was fairly slow but food was worth it!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast place around. I seriously continuously have the best experience here. The food is great: large portions, decent prices, and simply delicious. What makes this place so amazing though is their service! There's not one bad server in the joint!! I will not go anywhere else for breakfast!"}
{"text":"WOW the workers really know how to treat a customer well!! Let me tell you, I definitely felt like I received great service & I know great service when I see one coming from someone who has worked in a restaurant for 3 years. The food was great as well! I got a breakfast burrito with diced potatoes and it was so delicious. Our server's name was Brooke and he made sure we had a great experience as our server. The manager, Wayne, made sure my friend and I were doing great as well and took the time to say hello. I am very satisfied with this restaurant!! I would highly recommend coming for the great service and great food as well!!"}
{"text":"First time here service was lightning fast bloody Mary's had the perfect spice   Eggs were cooked perfectly the pork green chili gravy was amazing"}
{"text":"My friends and I just had breakfast due to our early release and I just want to say the service was amazing!! Lorie was very kind to all four of us and we felt very welcome and at home. When we were almost done with our hot chocolate she hooked us up with some more!!! I would definitely recommend, 11/10. :)"}
{"text":"This place is huge! Expect at least a 30 minute wait. They have some classic breakfast items and then they have a few that were unique. A friend at the table ordered the chorizo quesadilla, it was incredible. The breakfast burro was awesome as well. I ordered just eggs and bacon and there was nothing special about it. That combined with the very very long wait to he seated lead to the four stars. The air conditioning is high powered in this place, so be sure and wear a sweater!"}
{"text":"This place has become a top favorite in a very short period! They have amazing fresh food that tastes home cooked! Abs every time I have been here the staff has Ben super friendly and attentive. Weekends there is just about always a wait when I come for breakfast but it's so worth it. I would def recommend this place. Support a small business and get amazing food with huge portions and friend budgets doesn't get better then that! And for my bacon lovers out there you must try the bacon on it's own!! Super thick and crispy goodness!!"}
{"text":"This one of most favorite breakfast places anywhere. Come hungry they have some of the largest portions and the prices are low enough to bring a group of people. Go early or you'll be waiting for a little bit but it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"A nice place with friendly service and great breakfast food.  A large OJ is large! I asked by the ounces and got 16oz or 20oz, man it was a lotta juice but fresh and great tasting!  Primerib Platter - um this is known as a skillet, though I guess it's a platter since it's served on a plate.  Very nice hasbrowns, crispy, with primerib cooked medium after the second cooking with everything else (originally it's mid rare).  It was great flavor and great tenderness.  My sunny side up eggs were excellently cooked and perfectly runny.  Too bad I didn't eat the pancakes, too full!"}
{"text":"First time here,  Food was good, portions were excellent.  Fresh juice taste a little odd, but we're probably just used to store bought stuff.  Was a little pricey, but delicious.  We will probably come back in the future."}
{"text":"What a great place to come and get some delicious breakfast!  Every time I pass this place the parking lot is packed with cars and people outside waiting to be seated. I would've tried this place sooner, but always seem to be busy. This past weekend I was in the area early in the morning, so I decided to try my luck out and see if I could get in without too much of a wait.   The parking lot was already pretty packed at around 7:30 am when I arrived and by the time I got inside, there were a bunch of people in the waiting area waiting to be seated. The lady at the front took my name and phone number and told me it would be about 10-15 minute wait, which wasn't too bad considering this was a holiday weekend and there were a bunch of people ahead of me.   The inside of this restaurant is big with several different seating areas. I was seated on the side that has a bar. Since the place was so packed, the table they gave me was in the corner near the back of the restaurant. Not my favorite spot, as I like sitting near a window. Was kinda dark in my little corner.   I and my guest was greeted by a very nice waiter who immediately took our drink order and then came back and took our food order. I ordered the Ham breakfast skillet that was made of diced ham, diced bell peppers, onions, cheddar cheese and two eggs made to order and placed over a bed of diced potatoes. Comes with choice of a biscuit, pancakes, toast, or tortillas. I decided to get the tortillas, but I guess I should've asked if they were the flour or corn tortillas. I like my skillets with the corn, but they are served with the large (burrito size) tortillas. Cost $9.75. This is a good size serving, but not huge. A person with a big appetite would probably still be hungry after eating this item. For me though, it was more than enough and ended up taking about half home. My guest got the Griddle breakfast. Can choose between a Belgium Waffle, pancakes or French toast. They got the pancakes. Also comes with 2 eggs made to order and choice of Ham, Bacon or Sausage. They got the bacon. Cost $10.05. For an extra $1.15 you can add hash browns or Diced potatoes. Both of the items we got were well cooked and seasoned well.   Our waiter was very pleasant and accommodating with any special order we needed. He made sure to repeat our order to us before putting it in to make sure we got just what we wanted. He checked up on us frequently and made sure to take dirty dishes off the table as soon as we were finished with them. Brought our check out in a timely manner as well.   Will come back again, but might try and come earlier or not on a weekend. They had a lot of tasty looking items on their menu that I'd like to try out."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. We were treated very respectfully and prompt service. I would definitely recommend this to friends. Lindsay was a great waitress and very professional. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Yep, there's one in Phoenix my Flagstaff friends! So many people do not know we have one here too! The Place is always packed for breakfast - as it should be. The food is great! The portions are HUGE and fairly cheap. Even my glass of milk was just massive. But alas, so are most of the people who eat here. Service is mediocre, but the food does came out fairly fast, even when busy."}
{"text":"I had a delicious omelette, with potatoes and it hit the spot. Waitstaff was friendly and fast whether it was their station or not. It was obvious they liked each other and that warmth is rare these days. I look forward to eating here again and trying more items."}
{"text":"This place never Disappoints, the entire time I was prego I went there every month pretty much and now my munchkin is 5months and we still go just not as often, I'm trying to lose the... Wait for it... \"The place\" weight... Lol j/k still I love this place only thing is going on the weekends is INSANE! The weight time is crazy, and I'm not one of those people that will wait longer then 10-15min to eat no matter how good the food is ;)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great breakfast this is \"The Place\". Mike and Ronda started out in Flagstaff where they are a fixture in the community. So with bona fide  Mom & Pop credentials the restaurant is serving the very same kind of food you can get here today. Jo lived in Flagstaff for many years and has watched them grow there business. From one place then two... and now what was only a great place to stop on our travels through Flag is now here... Go in and try the biscuits and gravy we love them! They are know for there old fashion diner attitude, large portions and home style cooking. We love it!"}
{"text":"I. Love. This place. Big portions and selections of food. Awesome prices. The chicken fried steak platter and biscuits and gravy were the shit. The cinnamon buns are HUUUUGE."}
{"text":"I guess you have to be white to get served at this place. Me my wife and family came to get food for Mother's Day and we were told it was going to be a 30 min wait, so after waiting 30 min we still haven't been seated while watching a few other families walk up to be seated shortly after"}
{"text":"Yes the best place for breakfast with out a doubt in this part of Phoenix. I love there coffee, pancakes and biscuits."}
{"text":"That was one of the best breakfast joints in AZ. I love the yelp check in  if I didn't do that then we would be waiting an hour for a table. Don't get me wrong it is well worth for the wait!!!! The staff is awesome I cannot say any negative about this visit!"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday Dec. 3 2017. Had a two eggs, hashbrowns, bacon and biscuits and gravy. The biscuits and gravy were the WORST I have ever had. Will never order that again there !!!!! The rest was okay."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices! I've been to breakfast at The Place 3 times and never disappointed . The food and service are top notch, always s pleasure to see the friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We have went here for both breakfast and lunch, breakfast portions are big but full of grease I did not find it very appetizing. We went back for lunch my husband ordered a tuna salad sandwich and it had egg salad on portions of it like they started to make an egg salad then realized it was supposed to be tuna when asked to have it taken back server said just scrape it off. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"So good. The food is great and service staff was wonderful. The line here like other breakfast places is horribly long (often over an hour). The biscuits are really amazing. They are huge and so, so good. I'll go just for them."}
{"text":"How can you not love the place? It's just like your mommas cooking but without the family drama. Food always comes out fast and hot. The staff is friendly and efficient. The bar is a free for all so no reservations but great for game day mimosas. The wait can be long sometimes but I promise you won't regret it. Big portion sizes too!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! My favorite is the build your own omelet. The food is fresh and comes out fast!"}
{"text":"This place is all about quantity..Mandingo sized biscuits.. and some great homestyle cooking.. The thing I really like is that it tastes just like it did in college in  Flagstaff 20 years ago. The portion sizes are obnoxious!  The place seats 400.. on a Sunday morning.. about 80 people waiting for tables.. That's a great sign of good food.."}
{"text":"The food was excellent here!!!  The biscuits were huge and delicious, the gravy was like grandma's and the almond-crusted French toast was absolutely dreamy.  Mimosas are available if you are celebrating.  The Place is very large, so it accommodates groups easily.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! The pancakes are so big I think they flip them with a forklift!"}
{"text":"I really like the place.  Went again this morning and it was very statisfying.   It was 10am on a Thursday and they still had a full house.  Like my brother Justin L.  I switch between a burrito and the omelet  Had the build your own omelet today you choose one meat, one cheese and up to three toppings, which isn't enough for me but it's easy to add more.  I had ham, pepper jack, avacado, tomato, mushroom, green chilis and bellpeppers.  Its served with some hash browns and your choice of biscuit and gravy, toast, or english muffin.  I hadt the biscuit & gravy so the BF could have it.  He had the special of the day which was polish sausage, potatoes, bell peppers, etc, etc, with 2 eggs over easy and toast.  I love toast, hate gravy so it was perfect.  His was yummy.  Mine was fabulous, I'm not a breakfast person, but I ate my whole omelet!!!!  mmmmmmmm, then there is Tabasco on the table and i'm pretty much addicted to that stuff, so tons of green, a bit of red and it's good too go.      I like it, I love it, I want some more of it!! ^-^  cheesY"}
{"text":"After a couple of years going here I am upping it to a well deserved five.   I realized this after being on a  low iodine diet for 2 weeks ,eating nothing with salt,dairy,seafood or more than 6oz of meat a day,I waited and drove the extra 30 minutes from where I was to break my fast here.   I solved my hash brown issue by putting a cup of their green chili over it: Perfected  my burrito with  1 egg, chorizo, american cheese,peppers, avocado, and jalapenos ( as I said mine;) )   and the Amex thing , pah I'm an idiot.. that's been corrected, the review I mean  I'm still an idiot.   Staff have been  uniformly great, coffee barely goes dry, prices are totally reasonable because I usually don't need lunch on the days I eat here."}
{"text":"Basic place to eat.  Good service, nice enough place.  Nothing special, but if you are hungry--and want to eat cheap--dis be duh place!"}
{"text":"I love coming to The Place for breakfast. Even when it is busy, you really don't wait that long. I love the bacon here, I mean, I love bacon from most places, however they know how to make that bacon sing! The only issue I would have is that sometimes the tables, depending on how many you have can be a little cramped, that same feeling you get sitting in a chair in a kindergarten classroom, however that has only happened a couple times."}
{"text":"I've always been somewhat intrigued by \"The Place.\"  Every Saturday morning, while driving on Bell Road, I always see massive crowds of people gathered outside - as if they're trying to get inside some buzzing nightclub. And for a restaurant that isn't exactly what I'd classify as \"small,\" it's clearly a testament to Place's popularity with the locals. And while I don't quite share the same enthusiasm as a lot of reviewers do, they obviously are doing something right to have such a loyal fan base.   I'll be honest here. My girlfriend and I have stopped by a couple of times for brunch. Neither one of us were really disappointed, but we weren't exactly blown away either. It's just your basic breakfast food - without the corner cutting that occurs at corporate chains.   Now, if your only exposure to breakfast stems from dining at Denny's, IHOP, or even Waffle House, then sure, I can understand the appeal. But if you've ever ventured outside of the West Valley's Bell Road area, you'll quickly understand why this wouldn't be a top choice for a Sunday morning brunch.   As one reviewer stated, the place is geared towards generous portions at reasonable prices, so if you're the type who places heavy emphasis on quantity, then you'll probably be pretty happy. And don't get me wrong. The bacon, the eggs, the hash, they're fine. But is that all it takes to get a five star review? In today's food landscape, that's the equivalent of giving out \"participation\" trophies to little leaguers for simply showing up.   On a positive, the place does run like a well-oiled machine, as any respectable diner should. And for that, I guess I can see why some people like it.  Good as a neighborhood spot for those diners who enjoy playing it safe. Nothing more and nothing less."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast Sunday morning....  I ordered the breakfasat burrito for a change. When the very small, uncooked tortilla came out I was shocked, for $7 I would expect a burrito worth a man sized appetite not a taco bell bean burrito. I sent it back and order the 2 eggs and meat with bacon. The \"manager\" came over and I explained the situation about the burrito and he was as \"surprised\" as I was about the food (Really? you are the manager). My new meal came out quick with cold bacon that never hit the flat top and a filthy plate. I again asked for the \" manager\", I expalined how much we always loved the food but this was not good. I asked him to feel the plate (crusty, nasty 4 inch and gross) he was reluctant, but once he did he tried to say the plate was \"chipped up\", I cleaned it in front of him and yep, fithy he admitted. Now, this may be why the reviews are 4-5 stars or 1-2...\"management\". He never offered to comp the mess, half-heartedly forced himself to say \"I hope you come back\" (no real applology) and try again. After seeing the reviews I hope Mike and Ronda are willing to take a good look at who and how their historically great restaurant is being managed. Maybe I watch too much of the Food Network, but with all the competition (Black Bear cafe just dowwn the street) this place will continue to decline slowly until they are just a memory. -M. Mitchell (long time guest of the orginal \"Place\")"}
{"text":"I am already up and out the door and working when others are waiting in line to sit and eat a big breakfast but come 2:00 in the afternoon I am ready for something good to eat and have now gone to this restaurant for lunch anywhere between 1:30 and 2:30 in the afternoon.  I don't recommend the Place for lunch although I am a homeowner in the Sunburst Farms area because the afternoon waitress/manager is aggrogant and rude and a bit on the less than wholesome side.  A better choice is Freddy's Steakburger where the help is happy to have you there and are wholesome and cheerful and the food is especially good."}
{"text":"I have seen this place busy most every time we drive by. I was disappointed all of our food was only warm. My son's pancake was not even warm enough to melt butter. So I won't return not worth it food was only ok."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good service.  I requested a build-your-own omelette (hey Ollie, pay attention here) using chorizo, cheese, onion, and jalapeño).    The omelette was cooked just right, flavoring was simply fantastic.   Frankly, I started out giving 2 stars but when I kept thinking of that omelette, I just had to up it one more.     Bad thing - this place gets packed quickly.   By 9AM on a weekend, no big deal to see folks practically tailgating in the parking lot, waiting to get in (Yes, I'm exaggerating to make a point).  I don't understand why it gets so crowded.   Good marketing I guess.  Perhaps a dash of cult following!     Anyway - in summary, this place is good.  But, not good enough to line up and wait XXX hours to get in - no friggin' way.   Get here early,  eat and go about your day :)"}
{"text":"Disappointment.   $1 for plate sharing $2.75 for a kids orange juice (not freshly squeezed and more than the juice I buy at Fry's - why so expensive??? $3.50 for a side of bacon $3.50 for a side of sausage links.  $10 for the hungry man special that just wasn't $10 worth of food.  The service was great. Lightening speed in fact. Atmosphere inside was good. A room with a view was welcome to. I just can't abide by the pricing system. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast place near my Aunts house according to Yelp and my Aunt and Grandma also said it was good. There was nothing on the menu that stood out to me and nothing on the menu that seemed special so i ended up getting the chicken fried steak with hash browns and over easy eggs. The gravy on the chicken fried steak didnt have any flavor and kind of the samething with the hashbrowns. I added some salt and pepper to all of them and they tasted great after that.  I would go back if my family wanted to but id probably order something different next time."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast. Gets pretty packed so make sure to join the online wait list. Good size portions of food and drinks. Huge biscuits and gravy. Chicken fried steak is my favorite go to."}
{"text":"Coming early on a weekend morning can result in a little bit of a wait, but it's usually not too bad. Around noon the crowds ease up. The portions are hearty and I've never had a bad meal. If it's late enough in the morning, I order my favorite, the roast beef melt. The beef is cooked thoroughly, sliced fairly thick, and tender. Piled on sourdough with green chilies and cheddar cheese then grilled. Served with yummy, crispy french fries. I add the chipotle Tobasco to my sandwich, for a little smokey kick. My mouth is watering thinking about it, and I just had one yesterday! Their iced tea is delish...China Mist, I think. The staff is quick and friendly to top it off!"}
{"text":"Went in with high expectations and left wishing I went to dennys down the street. the food was nothing special. I had a bad meal and the manager never came by after i sent it back.  The server even said \"oh that does look bad\". It was not the servers fault she did great but the food was almost un edible."}
{"text":"Wait time wasn't bad for a Saturday morning. Waitress was young and annoying, if she called my husband sweetheart or honey again I was considering throat punching her. The French toast was dry, the gravy was watery, but the Mickey Mouse pancake for my little guy was awesome. Not sure if we will be back, too bad too I really wanted to like this place after all that I had heard about it."}
{"text":"No need to say much about The Place as the other reviews speak volumes. Took my wife and friend there for breakfast and we had three delicious meals. This is not like any restaurant I have ever eaten at. Honestly the food was just good. I had a Bloody Mary and it was great. The service was outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was excellent, our waitress was a hoot and made it a memorable experience. The food was hot and delishious and portions were very large. We will be going back again to visit this place in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place, I think the food is really good, I switch from Breakfast Burrito to an omlette, eggs are always cooked perfectly. Its usually busy  but I never seem to wait too long, probably because the wait staff is always running around, they are very quick and efficent. I have never made in for lunch but I have always wanted, I just dont live or work in the area so I just come over for B-fast. Good food, great portions, good prices."}
{"text":"I've noticed throngs of people waiting outside this place and figured it must be incredible.  The food wasn't bad.  Generous portions, generally good flavored stuff, etc... But I don't get the hype and the willingness to stand outside in Phoenix heat forever for some basic brekkie fare.  We had a party of four and went just after 1pm on a holiday, and fortunately we didn't have to wait for a table.  Unfortunately, the first interaction with staff was negative.  The host mumbled a few words to us about a kids menu, then gestured by way of a jerk of his head for us to follow him to our table.  Once there, he tossed down the menus and squirreled away as quickly as he could.  Not a single word.  He actually seemed quite pissed off - at what, I'm not sure.  Our waitress, Alana, made up for that first interaction.  She was attentive (but not overly so) and she seemed very friendly and fun.   All in all, for us, there just wasn't enough substance to back up the hype.  And I most certainly wouldn't be sitting outside sweating out a wait for a table here."}
{"text":"Big restaurant does big business serving big breakfasts for big eaters!  Portion size is twice what you get in other restaurants.  My corned beef  hash, hash browns and eggs filled the steak plate.  My breakfast buddy's steak and eggs breakfast was a huge piece of steak, served with double-sized biscuits.    The food was good, nothing special - I ate only one third of the meal.  Way too much food for me.  On the other hand my buddy's a big eater and wolfed down his meal.  My buddy recommends The Place, but as for me, not so much. I only like eating food that is special and really tasty. This was not it."}
{"text":"Great customer service, awesome food, huge portions and great environment!    Can get very busy so get there early.  Best biscuits and gravy I have had in some time now!!    So glad it's down the street from me, takes me back to my days in Flagstaff!!!"}
{"text":"It really made my day to come here. It was my first time here, and both the food and atmosphere were wonderful.  I brought a close friend of mine so that we could both experience breakfast here, and it was absolutely perfect for both of us.  I ordered the Arizona Omelet with hasbrowns and biscuits and gravy...and you know, I can eat a lot, but there was so much food that I nearly couldn't finish it all! My friend ordered the French Toast, 2 Eggs, and bacon. Everything we needed was either already on the table for us, or brought out promptly.  The price was really reasonable, and the service was outstanding. I've been to other breakfast places like U.S. Egg and others which are good too, but there's something very welcoming and comfortable about this place that just kind of set the ambience in the right direction and the rest of the experience in a positive light.  Everyone was very friendly, and the food was fresh, cooked and ready on the table in record time.  Will I be back? Definitely. Will I bring a friend again? Absolutely. I can't find anything to improve or complain about at all (and I'm normally particular about a lot of things when it comes to food and restaurants), so although I'm not sure what days other people come up here, maybe Wednesdays are the perfect day to stop in during the middle of the week?  I've been in a great mood all day after eating here, and I hope that if you stop in you'll experience the same. :) It's been an hour or two and I'm still full! lol  Oh, and if you're off work for the day or just hanging out, they also have a full bar in addition to booths and tables. I sampled some of that while here today.  Overall 5 stars and happy I came in. Would give 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"The place is not the place. We've been by many times and noticed the lines, so we thought we would stop in.  There was a little wait (approximately 10 minutes) even though there were several tables vacant.  The fact that they ask for your phone number to text you the table is ready is very inpersonal.   After being seated our server was quick to get our drink order.  When we recovered from sticker shock we ordered the meat and eggs. I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs up and my wife ordered the sausage patties and eggs over medium with pancakes.  Meanwhile my coffee cup never got below half.  The food arrived in a timely manner. That's where the major disappointment started.  The pancakes were flat, not fluffy, they gave a little butter typical of a chain restaurant. Having worked in the restaurant business I expect a nice scoop of butter on top of fluffy pancakes. The diced potatoes were unseasoned and deep fried. The eggs were ok.  I had hash browns that were only cooked on one side and not seasoned with the corned beef hash that came out of a can. I found the butter for the pancakes in my drenched toast.  Overall this is not the place as the food is ordinary nothing special to warrant any waiting time. For the amount you pay there are better places to go. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"We have passed by this spot several times now and finally decided to try it considering it's ALWAYS busy . So far, even with the amount of people here our wait for a table was fairly short. The food got to our table very quickly and the portions are good size and taste good.   The downside. . . The food could be hotter.  Ours was just warmish. The waitress started out seeming put off when we asked about changing things on our orders.  Then the next time she came to the table was much nicer. Maybe being pregnant has an affect on her. The mix on their Pepsi products is a little rich as well.   All in all we might come back. Most places like this we tend to stop visiting."}
{"text":"If you want breakfast to fill you up for the majority of the day come here lol. The food is good and homestyle. The wait isn't too bad even when it looks super crowded. It's a nice breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE the place! I went there all the time in college in Flagstaff and went to their Phoenix locations a few times.  The last time I went there I found a penny in my burrito.  A penny! Now I'm not one to make a fuss but I was there with my family and my dad called over the manger to notify her of the issue.  A girl - I think she was maybe the head waitress - comes over and my dad explains the issue with her and she immediately gets defensive.  She said ' I don't know what you want me to do it's not like it was done on purpose.   I just could not believe how she treated the whole situation!! I realize it was a mistake but I could've choked!  I was just looking for an apology and maybe a reasoning on how such a random object could've gotten into my food.  You guys need to get some better staff in there to handle situations like this.. or at least train your staff on how to handle this! I'm sad to say I won't be returning because of how the manager handled this."}
{"text":"Well let's start off by saying that I have tried a LOT of breakfast places in the valley. Some great, some good, some not so good. This falls in the last category. Coffee was distinctly flavored with bottom of an ashtray flavor. Undrinkable. I had the eggs Benedict something I don't make at home, so it's a treat to order out. It was sub par. And the side of potatoes tasted as if the potatoes has sat around for many moons. My son ordered the pancake, eggs and bacon combo. The eggs were very underdone. The pancakes, although a generous portion, were very tough. I was sad to spend my money here when there are so many places that blow this out of the water. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast joint on the west side. Good selection and reasonable prices and a rather large restaurant. Don't be turned off by the line and the waiting list...it goes fast..  On my few times I've been here I'm stuck on the build it yourself breakfast burrito. Lots of choices, personally I get bacon, cheese, eggs, tomato, and  avocado. Super yummy!  I've also tasted the chicken omelet which was good as well. Besides that I haven't had other items, but they do look good.   On a side note they also have some craft beer on tap. I've never had one while eating breakfast but I saw a sign of San Tan and Four Peaks seasonal on tap. That's cool!  Overall good service, good coffee and good food. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Love this place before and after it moved I had been to this location before it was \"the place\" it was filthy and dark they made this restaurant beautiful the food is great took my son there last week had breakfast burritos plenty of food and the only place I eats hash browns because they are crispy"}
{"text":"This place rocks, great diner with great food.  It doesn't say Mike & Ronda's but rather just \"The Place\" and it doesn't do it justice because it is much more than just \"the place\".  I had the chorizo plate and my brother had a sampler plate of every meat they have to offer.  The eggs were great, the hash browns were perfectly crisp and flavorful, the tortillas were fresh tasting and my brothers bacon was awesome.  I will definitely come back.  It doesn't look fancy inside but it is pretty large, I can imagine this place getting busy on the weekend but I usually avoid crowds when I can."}
{"text":"I was first shocked by how busy this place was. It was 11am on a Monday and it was rocking which I guess is a good thing. The portions were large as others had mentioned and the Arizona omelet I had was awesome. Pancakes were a little buttery for my liking and I passed on the hash browns because they looked greasy but thats just being critical."}
{"text":"Awesome as always. Go often. I just HATE that they have Pepsi. I drink water..I wish they would serve Coke and charge an extra quarter.. bacon is probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The Biscuits and Gravy here are the absolute best I've ever had! I'm also a fan of the Breakfast Sandwich as a perfect way to solve a hangover - the perfect balance of protein and carbs! The servers are always gracious.  In the old location I used to get a kick out of seeing the arms of the super-built, older (maybe 60s/70s age) owner flipping food through the kitchen window. It was the only part of him you could see, and I had no idea his age for months until he finally stepped out of the kitchen. In any case, the new location (they've been here a couple years now), has a hidden kitchen, but several more tables."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it is always packed. I am not a huge breakfast lover, but you never leave hungry after eating here. I usually just go for the usual egg and meat breakfast. I love their hashbrowns and the biscuits/gravy are delicious as well! While the food is great, my favorite thing about breakfast is a spicy bloody mary or mimosa. They do both of these, so I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Fastest, homemade quality breakfast I've ever had at a restaurant. The place is real cozy and great for large groups. All the servers were great at taking care of our needs. We had our food out in less than 10 minutes. Now that's impressive! Definitely recommend \"This Place\" when you're on this side of town. :-)  Compliments to our waiter Josh!"}
{"text":"How can people give it 5 stars. It's not top quality food. It's like fast food. Lower quality ingredients and didn't even taste good. Ok service."}
{"text":"Since Im big into breakfast foods, Im always on the look out for a new place.. and whadda ya know. .I found \"The Place\"  How convieeeeent..   I read the reviews and when asking a few people on Facebook about it, I heard nothing good good responses, so why not give it a shot.  I heard that you have to be early or it gets insane.  We showed up about 9AM and waited for maybe 5min.  Not too bad.   The menu looked incredible and as I watched the servers take food to the tables, I could see that the amounts of food give were enormous.  I couldn't wait.  Checking the reviews on Yelp, I ordered a chorizo omelet with avocado, and all the fixens.  I thought I'd love it, but I think I was more overwhelmed with spice than anything. and I love spicy food.. what gives?    The second time we all went, we got there at 8AM and sat right away.. this time I was told to order biscuits and gravy..  Damn were they good.  I got an order of those along with a huge pancake.   Here's what I loved about their pancakes.. they tasted home cooked.  Like when your mom takes out the old griddle that still has last weeks charred food on it,  yet still cooks on it, and it has that home yummy taste? Yep.. that's their pancakes.   Downed that with some iced tea and it was one awesome breakfast.    Ive been here three times now in two months... I think Im hooked."}
{"text":"The place is AWESOME! I love the Place and come here whenever I can. Yes the wait may be a little long but it is worth the wait and you definitely get more bang for your buck.   A few honorable mentions:  -The bacon is amazing. Biggest pieces of bacon in AZ(from my experience).  -There is a napkin dispenser at every table(I'm a napkin queen) -Mimosas are huge and cheap  Service is just Ok but the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Food is good, enormous servings we always have left overs. Service is awesome always courteous and on top of your drinks/needs. It does get packed, but the wait usually goes pretty quick."}
{"text":"Great low key breakfast place! Great for night shift workers too who want a cold beer early in the morning (evening) lol They are always pretty busy so don't be upset if you wait a few for a table but trust me, the portions are huge, food is great and wait staff is always kind!"}
{"text":"Great selection of breakfast, brunch, sandwhich and diner style option foods. The atmosphere is sub par, with mediocre service... slightly annoying at times, but what goes on beyond the line in food service shouldn't be compared with the quality of food, and speed of service for the price... and for that, this place is beyond great!! Can't help but continue to return  :) goooood stuff"}
{"text":"Generous portions, an attentive staff, and very popular.  We came here because it had such good reviews. It was worth the trip, as the food was delicious. They have a really nice menu, with a little bit of everything. Big ol' steak and eggs plate, if you're interested. I was, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Last Sunday, my friend and I (whom I haven't seen in months) decided to get together for brunch. There was a short wait, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. I ordered a mimosa and my friend ordered a bloody mary. The bartender was very accommodating, and even rimed my friend's bloody mary with pepper. Things seemed to be going smoothly until we were called to our table. Our waitress, Kayla, seemed less than pleased to wait on us. We ordered our meals and a shot called the \"breakfast shot\". Our food ended up coming, but our shots never came. Initially, we figured Kayla was busy and began eating. It wasn't until the manager stopped by our table when we realized that our server thought we were drunk, and asked the manager to check on us! It was an awkward conversation, and quite frankly, ruined the rest of the meal. My friend and I were just there to have a good time and only ordered one drink from the bar which we were still nursing. After feeling humiliated, our shots were dropped off. That was the last time we saw our waitress until the bill came. The manager stopped by once more to make an awkward joke, which only added insult to injury. We wanted to leave, but because our waitress never came back to our table, we weren't sure what to do. I will never go back to this establishment again. My friend and I were humiliated, and this experience ruined our reunion that was supposed to be fun."}
{"text":"One of my fave places to go for brunch on the weekends. Awesome atmosphere, friendly service and excellent food. The only catch....it's pretty packed and busy on the weekends so get here really early."}
{"text":"Good food and large portions. The atmosphere is your typical restaurant feel. This place is always busy for breakfast and lunch. The only downside is that their coffee is pretty weak and bland."}
{"text":"To start off, the food was delicious. Although, we waited 15 minutes for no server to show up and the person who sat us just ended up taking our order."}
{"text":"I've found a new place to visit when in the Phoenix area! I had the beef brisket Benedict special.The homemade biscuits are so soft and fluffy but not dry. The chocolate chip pancakes are huge, and the bacon is thick. Definitely glad I checked in ahead on Yelp because we would've had a 45 minute wait. Bringing the whole family here next time!"}
{"text":"If you like big portions, this is the place for you. Food is average, nothing I would exactly rave about, but I have never been disappointed. I haven't had a waiter/waitress who isn't nice, which is always good. The biscuits are one of my favorite things about this place. I usually get pancakes and an omelette, but I had a biscuit last time and yum! I don't mind waiting because it usually doesn't take too long to get in, and it's a fun place to go with a few friends."}
{"text":"Love This Place!  Food 4/5 - I had the Eggs Benedict with pancakes. I think the Hollandaise is a mix but other than that it was great!  Eggs cooked just right & cakes were delicious.  Service 4/5 - Servers are always very nice but they can never get my order right...   Value 4/5 - Pretty affordable for a family of 5!  Overall 4/5 - Love this place!  Will I be back? Yup!  Would I recommend to a friend? Yup... with the caveat \"Just be patient with the waitstaff!\""}
{"text":"What a great experience we had today. We expect in a longer wait but our table is ready within 5 to 10 minutes. The place is clean the servers are friendly and personable, and the ambience is fun. The food is delicious and served abundantly. We had quiche a skillet, Hungry man special and biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon. Everything was made to perfection. We will be back and bring visitors for a great experience."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast Ever!!!!!!!!!! Huge plates everything made fresh great homemade taste, absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Yelpers never let us down. ;) We had a special:  omelet with prime rib onions green peppers cheese eggs home fries all mixed together...it was yummy!  Bread was good service good and portions LARGE.  OJ was 16 oz and meal was splitable IMHO.  don't salt your food, it was plenty salty ;)"}
{"text":"Fast, delishious, trucker-sized breakfast.  Bacon was thick, Pancakes were the size of the plates and the service was good.   They were pretty busy and it only took about 10 minutes to get a table for 5 of us."}
{"text":"Came to The Place on Saturday for brunch. While looking on Yelp for somewhere good to eat, if notified me that there would be about a 15-20 minute wait. So i added my name to the list while still on the way there (fantastic option). We got that right at 12:00 and were seated in no time. We ordered the cinnamon roll as a appetizer. Let me warn you now, they are huge yet DELICIOUS! We devoured that and then ordered the Griddle Breakfast with a waffle, bacon, and eggs all cooked to perfection. My husband ordered the country breakfast Benedict (open faced biscuit covered in sausage, eggs and gravy with a side of hash browns. Everything was delicious and we took left overs home and enjoyed them later that day as well. We will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I have been to the original The Place many times in Flagstaff when I lived there, but yesterday was the first time I have been to this location. And man, did it bring me back to the good old times! Same great recipes, same great prices. The pancakes are huge and fluffy. The biscuits are soft and buttery. I got the 2 eggs entrée, and it was perfect. I substituted the multigrain pancakes and they were nice and nutty. My husband got the polish sausage bowl, and I had a bite and could have had many, many more. We had a party of 6 (plus 2 kids), and the service was fast and efficient and polite. The restaurant is also really cool inside with the chandeliers  and wood paneling - it reminded me of a lodge. I felt like I should be in the mountains (you know, the kind with pine trees), and not the desert. I wish it wasn't so far from my house otherwise this would be my new favorite breakfast place! After all, it is \"The Place\"!"}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time on a Sunday. Great food and reasonable prices for the amount of food you get. Service was fast and friendly. All servers walk around with coffee to make sure your cup is never empty.   I'm a transplant from New Jersey, this is no NJ diner, but it's the best place I've found in the west valley that comes close.  Tip, if you come on a weekend after 8am expect to wait for a table. The dining room is rather large but this place gets packed. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place !! Sooo happy it was brought from flagstaff down here ! Their biscuits and gravy never disappoint !! Omelettes are the best ever !"}
{"text":"I am a fan of diners so I wanted to check The Place out.   It's located in the corner of a decaying strip mall on the edge of Glendale and Phoenix.  Trying to keep the outside appearance of the restaurant looking nice, which it does.  The inside looks almost like a cafeteria with not much decor to make it stand out with character.  The food to me was greasy(which is desired for diners), but I wasn't getting the great flavors to match it.  This Place may be a local favorite for many people.  The service may be the reason that keeps patrons coming back.  I on the other hand will continue to look for other restaurants that know how to execute on all levels."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite breakfast place in town. They're is always a wait on the weekend for breakfast, but they turnover the tables really quickly. The biscuits are HUGE, and the special of the day is always delicious.  We definitely can't complain about the portions, except to say they're too much to eat in one setting."}
{"text":"After checking Yelp we had to come here!! I use to come here when it was Tres Margaritas and I thought, what a big building for a breakfast establishment. Funny thing is this place is so busy that it's perfect that it is so big.   The portion sizes are gianormous!! The biscuits are huge and delicious and the service was great. I was very impressed and will to back."}
{"text":"I have lived in the phoenix area for quite a few years and I never knew this place existed until I found them on yelp. It was an amazing find, the food and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Good place to sit and chill but depending on what food item you order, you may or may not be satisfied. Mimosas were on point though it is a whopping $5 for a could be bigger glass. And it isn't Bottomless either, sadness and sorrow. I ordered the Build Your Own Breakfast Burro and it was somewhat on the wimpy side. When I think breakfast burrito I think huge loaded goodness. What I got I could have made myself and wasn't worth the price I paid. Now if you get the omelette, that thing is HUGE and I will probably order that next time. The biscuits are HUGE so I wouldn't mind getting a side of biscuits and gravy next time.  Overall, the take-home message is choose your meal wisely. I made a first-time error with my burrito but anything else on the menu looks decently sized and delicious. Customer service was wonderful so it definitely made up for my sad burrito."}
{"text":"Drove past here a dozen times and finally got around to checking it out, had no idea what I was missing!   This place is old school inside, really neat sorta truck-stop/roadside diner looking vibe going on. Truth be told I was surprised when I first walked in the door, but it really grew on me! You don't see many places like this, certainly not in the middle of Phoenix.   The authentic look was complemented by the authentic food, all of which has been great. My wife and I have tried the burgers, the chicken tenders and the pulled pork, along with several of the soups, all with great results.   The food here is unpretentious, authentic, simple but absolutely delicious. I haven't been able to try their breakfast yet, which seems very popular, but I can certainly vouch for the dinner.   Service has, on all occasions, been wonderful and quick. Never felt ignored, never had my drinks run dry and always had a smile from the servers. Looking forward to going back and eventually trying breakfast here, and would encourage anyone else to do the same. Great place!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, very cheap prices, delicious biscuits and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Food is alright...but there's a lot of competition nearby with Black Bear Diner, US Egg among many others.  Service was utterly unacceptable, but they may have been short staffed, or it was a new manager's first day.  It was obvious that the employees were in over their head, rushing around, running into each other.  The bus people cleaning the tables were unusually loud, sounding like they were constantly breaking glasses- more distracting than you'd think.   We asked for a kid's menu multiple times- never received one.  We asked for tea, and only received a cup of hot water....when we finally got a tea bag, the water wasn't hot anymore. Our waiter was well-mannered, but we felt bad because he was clearly overwhelmed.  Even my mom, who is the most laid back, easy going person from rural Pennsylvania commented \"that was surprisingly bad service\".  I've never heard her say that before about any restaurant.... 4 stars for the food, two for the service- three stars is a good overall balance.  I recommend going when they're not busy, or with a small party of 2, or trying Black Bear Diner not far away."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast.  Huevos rancheros and chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy.  Won't be back. Not good at all. Very disappointing.  Bloody Mary's were just ok."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for a few days and was looking for a good local non chain restaurant for lunch. Happened to just drive by. Lots of people heading in and out. Figured it was pretty good.It was!   Had a delicious patty melt.  Everything tasted fresh and high quality.  Excellent service as well Place was packed but the noise not deafening.  The ambiance was casual and cozy..   Will definitely eat there again and recommend it."}
{"text":"You need to go here for breakfast, seriously.  It's really great.  It's not fru-fru, it's just a solid breakfast spot.  The coffee is great, service is very friendly.  Went on a Saturday morning around 8:30 and they were blown up but the staff was hopping and turning tables quickly.    We sat at the counter so didn't have to wait.  Breakfast burro was fantastic you pick the meat,cheese and 3 veggies.  I selected chorizo for meat, it's nice and spicy not greasy, everything was perfectly cooked and right amounts.  The salsa is really good and the guy seated next to me said the chorizo is made in house.   My husband had the biscuits with sausage and gravy,he was so happy to finally find a place with good gravy.  Huge portions we both only ate half our servings.  $22 for two breakfast entrees and two drinks, great value.  Saw a lot of families, lot of groups of big fellas too.  They also have a bar top seating area, definitely want to go back and try the bloody mary!  The hostess station attendants are not very friendly but don't let that put you off, everyone else is!  Check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my mom because we wanted to see if they were better than Black Bear Diner. To cut it short, they are not. Better customer service at Black Bear and I feel that the food is better.  My first dilemma- I ordered the open face beef sandwhich. At the top of the menu it said i had the choice of fries, potato salad, soup, or a salad. I could sub those items for onion rings or sweet potato fries for a $1 extra. So i picked to sub a regular side as stated on the menu and do onion rings for $1 extra. BUT I still got charged for a side of onion rings which is almost $4. The waitress argued that I dont get a side because i got mashed potatos on my sandwhich. We showed her the menu and she still continued to say otherwise. Well, if you think about what an OPEN FACED BEEF SANDWHICH is and what they are saying comes on the sandwhich, its piled with potatos. If my meal didnt come with a side then they should have stated on the menu that the opened faced sandwhiches do not come with a choice of side, or the waitress should have said your onion rings will be $4 extra. But dont put on your menu that ALL sandwhiches come with a choice of side if they dont. If your going to single out sandwhiches then at least make them known to the customer.   The taste. As far as the taste goes, i wouldnt order it again. The potatos were decent and it was clear they were freshly made. The meat did not really have a taste to it even after adding salt and pepper. The gravy was extremely salty and was really the only thing that added flavor to that dish. The waitress stated that the bread was a thick texas bread. My mom and I had to laugh because the thickest the \"texas\" bread got was your average slice of white bread which was exactly what it was, white bread. To top it off they put 2 slices under your meat and the bottom slice that was hidden was not even a full slice. Its not that hard to just put a new slice on instead of trying to hide it, it wasnt as if it was toasted so it wouldnt take much time to swap it out. Just a thought. The onion rings i ordered were great. Are they worth $4? Absolutely not. Ive had a lot better onion rings but these were worth a try.  My mom ordered the grilled chicken sandwhich which was under the same category as my sandwhich keep in mind here. She ordered sweet potato fries for a $1 extra. She asked for mayo on her sandwhich and by the time she had got it, the mayo had dried up and turned a tint yellow, she had to ask for an extra side of it. Yuck. This is probley from the fact that when she was brought her dish, it came out with regular fries so the waitress had to take the dish back and exchange those fries for the sweet potato ones, which took extra time. We had to laugh at her dish as well because her sandwhich came with, 1 little tomato, 1 HALF slice of lettuce and crusty mayo on an untoasted bun. Her verdict was that the chicken didnt really have a taste to it. She enjoyed the sweet potato fries though and thought they were worth the extra $1.   We wanted to try their pumpkin muffin and pumpkin coffee cake, but that desire ended real quickly after our dinning experience..  I never really have to include soda in my reviews because ive never really had a problem. But the soda didnt taste like the soda it was supposed to be. My moms pepsi tasted very watered down, flat and had a small after taste that we both couldnt pin point. She orders her drinks without ice, so there really was no reason or excuse we could find. The Sprite was a disaster as well, i really could have just drank water, squeezed a couple lemons and put a little sugar and it would have been the same.   Although things were brought to their attention, nothing was done to fix or even offered to be fixed. It was just an argument or excuse on why it was that way. Instead of offering a different soda, there was just an excuse on why it was the way it was and that was it. No water, no nothing. Instead of offering another slice of tomato, the excuse was that it just came that way and theres nothing she could do for us or bring an extra slice of tomato.  I mean really? The manager came over and listened but again didnt really do anything to change the situation besides change the $4 onion rings to $1 per what the menu states. It just seemed to be excuse after excuse which was really surprising seeing them be so friendly with the older crowd.  As a first timer, this was a bit much and i dont think my mom and I will be giving it a second try. Not if its such a hassel to get an extra slice of tomato or a decent soda. Yelp let me down this time.."}
{"text":"Loved this place, can't wait to return!  It was a 15-20 minute wait, which I don't think is bad for weekend breakfast.  Once we ordered, the food came out very fast.  Always folks coming around to offer to refill your coffee.  I had an omelet with chorizo, pepper jack, avocado and sour cream.  It was delicious!  They didn't use too much egg, it really focused on the ingredients.  For my sides I had hash browns and biscuit and gravy.  I love biscuits and gravy, but theirs were very mediocre.  The hash browns were good and crisp on the top..  My hubby had the bacon and eggs with hash browns and sourdough toast.  All very good.  The portions are also large, no way you can leave feeling hungry.  It was also very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have been going here for about 2 years. started out at the old small place and now the big place. I have ALWAYS loved eating here. I was SUUUPER excited to take my bf here and so we went and here goes...  we were seated for about 20 minutes before someone got our order.   we both ordered the sirloin tips that came with hash browns, eggs and pancakes..ALL FOR $10!!! cheap!! and We both got coffee....well, the water had more flavor than the coffee. It was not dark AT all.    Our food came out, it was good as usual, but our pancakes didnt show up. No one checked to see if everything was ok or if our order was complete. finally after hunting down our incompetent (sp) waiter, we told him we didnt get our pancakes, so he went and apparently they had been sitting out and they just \"forgot\" to bring them. SO YOUR FORGETFULNESS caused my pancake to get cold! And we usually get 2 panckes and they ONLY gave us one. Our waiter disappeared again, and we had to wait for like half an hour after we were done eating to receive our bill, and then finally some waitress noticed we had been waiting and got our bill for us. THEN we had to wait another 10 minutes to get our bill picked up.   This is one of the worst restaurant experiences we have ever had. And it is SUCH a shame because I actually liked your food but NOT enough to return with that kind of lousiness you have going on.   Oh and FYI, you may want to change the dress code of your staff. When I eat i dont want to see my waiter/waitress in cut off sleevless shirts showing me their sweaty/hairy armpits."}
{"text":"We live out in NH and come to visit for a month or so. We found this place the last time out and made it a regular stop for breakfast and sometimes lunch. The food is good and never had a complaint. Coffee on the other hand seemed to always be strong and tasted burnt at times. Other than that was always a good place to eat. We settled the coffee issue by ordering something else and at a later time stop at DDs for a coffee."}
{"text":"I don't understand where all these 3,4,&5 star reviewers ate because it couldn't possibly be the same place I ate. I came here on a Saturday morning and they were moderately busy. The wait wasn't to bad and we were seated within 10 minutes. The wait staff was terrible. The entire time we were there she checked on us one time after the initial order was placed. Actually we had a bus boy bring us all the additional items we needed. Every time I looked around for our waitress she was just standing in the corner. Her attitude was terrible. Aside from the bad service the food was mediocre. I didn't find out until 3 hours later but it also made me sick. Right before we left we went to the bathroom and there was feces smeared all over one of the toilets and the floor. If I would have seen this before I would have left immediately. I will never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Well, I guess the bar is much lower in Flagstaff, as we went to their restaurant in Glendale for breakfast.  It was less than mediocre.  Starting with the coffee, which tasted awful..it was very bitter and watching the waitress pour old decaffinated coffee into a regular coffee pot! Unacceptable.  I had bacon and eggs...fair. Asked for the hashbrowns to be well done..didn't make a difference, I guess, as they came out raw.  Also, asked that my toast be dry...came out saturated with butter.  My husband had the chicken fried steak with gravy...you could have plastered a house with the gravy!  As you can tell, we will not be returning.  The reason we went, was because of their article in the paper this week.  Just shows, that you can't believe believe everything you read.  My husband, \"jokingly, suggested, that we cancel the paper!"}
{"text":"The service level and attitude of the staff was diabolical, they demonstrated absolutely no interest in our business. Ever since moving to the new premises, things have sucked. I shall not be wasting any more of my time or money here."}
{"text":"My hubby and i decided to give this place a try for breakfast.  We had been looking for a good local place to go and enjoy a hearty breakfast/brunch, after long night of patying... The overall appearance of the place didn't feel cozy, but we had no wait and our server was very attentive, lively, and just plain pleasant. The food was GREAT, and we were served quickly!  I did notice that we were surrounded by huge people...i guess they must be \"regulars\"...LOL! Overall a great experiance, loved the food and will visiting again soon...Hope not to become \"regulars\", but a big hearty brunch won't hurt us!!!"}
{"text":"Great food great place well done keep up the great work foods amazing priced well! Love that a family owned place is thriving!"}
{"text":"Would have been 4 stats based on prior visit. This past visit the service was just garbage. Not the servers fault, she should have never been on the floor in the first place. Pretty annoyed that she had to ask other servers for assistance while taking our order. What's the soup? I don't know, Jim what's the soup? Is there cheese on the French dip. I don't know? Karen is there cheese on the French dip? The food has always been great and we will be back. Hopefully I can give them 4 stars next visit? Oh yeah, love the.new location!"}
{"text":"The wait was around 15 mins, the waitress was friendly and offered up suggestions on her favorite dishes. The plates are heafty and the food is good! The only down side is the wait and their lack of flavored creamer... But certainly worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I used to go here when they were in a much smaller place across the street. They have since moved and expanded which is a fantastic thing and they have a full bar now (YAY!)  The biscuits and gravy are absolutely out of this world, so is their chorizo. Its a very casual laid back atmosphere. If you are looking for 5 star, stuffy dining, this isn't the place for you. If you are looking for some where you can relax and get some wonderful food you have found your calling.   The bar gives off the Cheers vibe. I feel like if I were a regular they would know me, my life story and my drink preference when I walked in the door.   I really like this place and I think you will too.  This message has been approved by the Patricia Stedman political campaign for good food!"}
{"text":"Great portion size, and better staff. Fast, friendly, and always good! One of my favorite places to breakfast or lunch. The only downside is too many people know about it, and occasionally you have to wait."}
{"text":"Good food for a great deal!  They make it fast and the price is right. I would come here most mornings, if I could.  Since moving to their new, larger location, even with a large crowd, there is not much waiting, if any."}
{"text":"Nice place Mike & Rhonda! I love the special order omelet I get every time. Good food good service."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Service is professional and very friendly.  There can be a long wait on Saturdays and Sundays but they do have comfortable seats in the waiting area in the front.  I had the special of the day Carne Asada omelet and it was awesome."}
{"text":"This is a very busy place, even on weekday mornings. We came here around 10:00 on a Thursday and the place was packed. I got two multi-grain pancakes (they're huge - two was more than enough!) and they were delicious, with a hint of cinnamon. The coffee was quite good as well.  While the food and service get 5 stars, this is a VERY noisy place when it's full -- it was very hard for me to hear my companions just across our table.   Recommended!"}
{"text":"Such great portions! The griddle sampler: pancakes or French toast, choice of egg doneness then breakfast potatoes or hash browns, THEN choice of meat, bacon, sausage or ham steak. So good. The French toast is great Texas toast. We really dig this place, be prepared to be full and have a to-go box. Service has always been good. Prices are really good considering it's breakfast and how much food you get!  They have daily specials, one was carrot cake pancakes with cream cheese icing. Rich and huge size on them! Almost bigger than the huge sized plate! You're able to get a well rounded breakfast, very affordable."}
{"text":"Maybe this place grew too large, or maybe Mike &Ronda are in Flagstaff instead of here, but this is NOT the same place as it used to be. Half hour wait to get in is now the standard, but shouldn't we be able to expect hot meals and cold beverages?  * O.J. was room temperature...?!? * hash browns were just a heap of uncooked potatoes * toast was cold and soggy * had to beg other servers to keep our coffee filled * horrible service - after we got beverages, our waitress came along and started placing out more silverware & napkins on the table, as if we were invisible...?!? * when we paid, they gave us a discount, which, after the O.J., turned out to be $2 off of a $25 bill.  All that said, the potato wedges were yummy, and the biscuits are still the best anywhere.  But, truth be told, if you're looking for what the Place used to have, google Ollie's...  Their gravy is better anyway."}
{"text":"I've been here before but didn't review. I like their mimosa's. I went around 1:00 pm this afternoon with my boyfriend. They are in a good location right on Bell Road, I think they close at 3pm but don't quote me on that. I really was in the mood for corned beef hash and was very happy to see it on the menu under Meat and Eggs on the Breakfast side. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese, diced potatoes, corned beef hash and a pancake. Instead of the mimosa I ordered a big 20 oz. glass of orange juice. It was pretty good. My eggs were a little flavorless, I like the eggs at Denny's better. Pancake was fluffy and the maple syrup was good too. The corned beef hash had the right amount of salty taste, I like mine a little burnt and this had a good amount of crisp to it. The potatoes are seasoned well. It was a delicious afternoon breakfast. The bill wasn't too bad, though my orange juice was nearly $5 and I commented that I could buy a gallon of orange juice at walmart for $5. However she did mention that the orange juice was fresh squeezed so that made it worth it. I like The Place."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast , and filling! About the other review by \"pepper\" , I like that the orders there are large. In my opinion it is quality and quantity. Some fad places here in phoenix charge double , some triple for a meal that doesn't stand up to this restaurant. I have only been there during breakfast but I hear dinner is fantastic too. I personally love the sunny side up eggs. They seem to be the only place that makes them perfect. And the toast , its just irresistible to me."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great! Great big portion! Great taste! Good price! Great server! All good! Only complain is make sure to come in 30 min or so earlier for the wait seating."}
{"text":"Wow! That was a great breakfast... maybe it was the quality at a low price... maybe it was the large serving size... maybe it was the great and fast service... I'm pulling out the five stars for this one and I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the BEST breakfast place around this area of town. Convenient location, great service, and huge portions. The prices are super cheap for how much food you are given. I always leave with left-overs. The waiters literally run around making sure you have what you need. Very friendly and delicious. They also have a bar which is great."}
{"text":"Big portions is what you hear and read about...Very true. The food is pretty good, overall a nice breakfast. The layout of the place is a little bit like a warehouse or industrial. The service was fast and friendly. My biggest grip is that they use the wussy silverware here. The low-grade cheap, light, flimsy stuff that sucks. I believe that I met Mike in the Men's Room. He addressed me as I was taking a leak. First rule of Men's Room etiquette \"Don't talk to another man while he is peeing\". He asked if I liked the place, I said it was my first time. It was good but not somewhere that will be a breakfast destination for me."}
{"text":"Service was awful,the food not cooked all the way, silverware dirty eggs not cooked,utensils dirty, will not go back. This is true, so,correct the problem.DONOT insult reviewer"}
{"text":"Good food and huge portions! There is a reason why the line is alway so long."}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant where literally every single employee looked like they hated working there. First time I had ever been there was last week. First, let me start off by saying we had 3 different waiters tell us they would bring our drinks. 10 minutes later, still nothing. Mind you, it was busy so me and my friend did understand. Next, we asked for a high chair for our 2 year old child right when we walked in. We were placed at a table with chairs, not a booth(which we were totally okay with), but trying to keep a 2 year old child to sit safely in a chair is difficult to do. We waited 15 minutes for a high chair.   The food came extremely fast which was great. But our drinks were not filled up until we asked for a refill. My drink was so empty I was eating the ice out of it. When we were done eating, we got our receipts. My friend who had eaten here before told me \"I think if you pay with card at the front.\" (Again, this was my first time here). The waitress comes back to us and I said \"do you we pay with you?\" The waitress responds with \"well unless you wanna wait then I suggest you do\". Attitude much? The workers here are so rude.   Anyways, so I thought I would try this place out one more time because they have pretty good food. We get there, get seated right away, they asked what drinks we wanted, I requested an iced tea with lemon. Drinks Come back, no lemon. Whatever. No big deal I guess. Food comes, our waitress checks on us ONCE. Oh by the way, me and my friend got hash browns, they weren't cooked all the way. I stopped eating mine because it was so gross. The waitress comes back and asked if we wanted separate bills, we say yes. We are sitting where we can see into the kitchen. And we just see her cleaning and staring right at us. 10 minutes later waiting for our bill, my friend decides to start stacking up the plates so maybe someone will notice we are done. She finally brings the bills, I say thank you, (as I did every time she did something for us) and she just walks away. Geez lady a you're welcome would've been nice! Never eating there again. All the workers hate working there. You can just feel the tension. I suggest not eating here unless you want rude workers who might or might not spit in your food depending on the day they are having."}
{"text":"Went today for late breakfast.... Food and service were perfect as usual.  What I can't stand are the snotty hostesses.  For the second time in a row, I found them to be curt and rude.  Do the owners not care that their front line employees are this rude?? They act like they are too good to be bothered to do their job.  I'll think twice before going back again.  Shame."}
{"text":"Great prices and lots to choose from for breakfast. Portions are big, you will end up taking some home."}
{"text":"I went with some friends to The Place after hearing great things about the food. I had a combo that came with eggs. I asked if I could exchange the eggs for something else such as fruit since I can't eat them. The request was flat out refused which is really unusual for restaurants these days. The combo had the option of adding potatoes so I asked for those to be included and that there were no eggs that came with the meal. When the bill came they charged me full price for the meal AND an extra charge for the potatoes regardless of the fact I was missing a 1/3 of the combo.   I understand why they did it but it really, really bothered me. I paid the bill without complaint and knew I would not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Service is great. The food is very good for a very reasonable price. My husband and I had French dip, a tuna melt and a pancake (they looked so good we had to try one). Everything was delicious. This is our new favorite breakfast/brunch spot."}
{"text":"Great service!  And the breakfast my wife and I had was awesome.  Food was delicious and even the ice tea I had was delicious.  Can't wait for another opportunity to go there again!"}
{"text":"Homestyle meals with that family atmosphere. I grew up in a small single highway town with no on ramps where everyone knows everyone. This place is a little slice of that sort of peaceful tucked in Phoenix. I always get a bit nervous taking my year and a half old son out for a meal.   If you want a place that puts the milk directly into the sippy for you, this is hands down as close as you will get to that family breakfast feeling. The staff was incredible with my son and they didn't put pressure on the meal. The food came out hot, seasoned and in abundance which is always a nice feeling when I want a slow meal with the munchkin.   I went with the biscuits and gravy that, as you can see was beautiful. But what I loved most was the extra mile gone to give my son a memorable meal!  But it was nice to walk in, sit down, take our time and feel like we were home."}
{"text":"I grew up in Flagstaff and that is where Mike and Ronda's (The Place) started. I was happy to learn that they opened a restaurant in Phoenix. I recommend the spicy bloody mary's and the chicken fried steak is really good. The prices are reasonable and portions are always way too much to eat in one sitting. This is one of my favorite breakfast places ever."}
{"text":"I love The Place! All the staff is incredibly friendly and the food is amazing. Service is always super fast and efficient. Most definitely my favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Took my grandma here for breakfast and arrived around 915. There were quite a few people waiting outside, however we only had to wait about 10-15 minutes. We even got sat in a booth without even asking (which was perfect for my grandma). She got the country fried steak and eggs, I got the bacon skillet. My grandma devoured hers, the biscuit was so fluffy and the portions are very generous. The skillet was also great, just wished the bell peppers and onions were cooked more. I don't care for crunchy undercooked veggies when everything else is piping hot. Some of the bacon was also burnt (like literally charcoal burnt). I also couldn't eat my biscuit and gravy I was pretty full. Also the ice tea was the biggest cup I've ever received! I couldn't even finish half."}
{"text":"Food was ok, the diced potatoes seemed like they were out of bag. Sausage patty was similar to Mcdonalds, bacon was overcooked and hard to cut. Pancake was nothing to write home about. The butter comes in a package, seems like everything else does to. The server that we had didn't smile once, there were friendlier servers in the restaurant. I won't be back. :- ("}
{"text":"Fast, fun and delicious.  Service excellent, broad selection of great breakfast meals, and served piping hot!"}
{"text":"A biscuit the size of a softball? Check. One of if not the best chicken fried steaks in Arizona check. Long long wait if your late check. Line out the door Sat and Sun. Mornings of course. When they were in the strip mall East of here the crowds were big but now even more so. So get here early or get ready to wait. In my opinion this place is worth the wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating here for years! I love the 2 eggs with hash browns and pancakes. My husband always gets the chicken fried steak. The quality, service and prices can't be beat!!"}
{"text":"In the words of the BF, \"The breakfast at the Place can't be beat. It's nothing spectacular, its just a good price and a lot of food.\"   That pretty much sums it up. I am a huge fan of both The Place in Phoenix and in Flagstaff. In fact, we just ate at the home base in Flagstaff this past Sunday for breakfast! My mother from PA and my best friend from San Diego insist on eating here every time they come to visit me in Phoenix. EVERY TIME. Also, being from the East coast...any place with Pepsi and NOT Coke products gets my vote! :o)  I always get the M.Y.O. Omelette and I am never disappointed! The biscuits and white gravy are AWESOME! The only real complaint on the food I can think of is not enough crusty bits in the hashbrowns...and honestly, that's not too big of a deal. I just like really crunchy hashbrowns!  The only bummer about the Place in Phoenix is that if you don't get there before 9am you're due to wait for a L-O-N-G T-I-M-E because its so freakin' good everybody wants in! However, if you don't beat the church crowd, don't fret....it's totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The place is the best place. Lots of good good food. Highly recommended!! Good drinks as well there bloody Mary and omelette is my favorite"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some place different in our neighborhood and while driving around we found The Place. We shoulda keep going. Anyhoo, we both ordered bloody Mary's which was out first mistake. C'mon! Vodka and the premix stuff for $5 each? Geeez. I make way better ones at home. Shoulda Coulda. Then we ordered the Breakfast Steak. Tasted like old meat Well The little that we found in between all the fat. \"photo on Facebook\". Bad experience cost us $40. So with that said we will definitely NOT be back.  Oh gravy for biscuits tastes from the jar. No sausage in the gravy. Didn't wanna forget that."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a busy Saturday morning. Placed was packed! We waited about 10 minutes for our table for two. We had some pancakes and omelettes. Good stuff. Made to order and fresh. We topped off our meal with a huge cinnamon roll that was piping hot and tasty. Service was great as the staff was friendly and accommodating. Restaurant is also kept clean."}
{"text":"Loved \"The Place\". Friends recommended it so went with them today. Service was good and food was awesome. BIG portions and can easily be shared. Come in early otherwise a long line awaits you."}
{"text":"Went to The Place for breakfast and was shocked to find that there was no wait! There are always people waiting outside on Sunday morning. Not sure if we were just early or if people are still eating leftover turkey. We got seated right away and I ordered the Waffle Breakfast with scrambled eggs (well done) and bacon. It took quite awhile to get our food, considering they weren't very busy. But when it finally came out, it was fresh and hot. The eggs were cooked correctly as always and the waffle was perfect. I also tried some of my friend's chorizo quesadilla and diced potatoes. So tasty! Aside from the long wait for the food, it was a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and they are very generous portions. The restaurant looks modern. Most importantly, the staff make you feel like family. Definitely one of my top favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"When we walked in the hostess had her back to the front door. She looked over her shoulder and gestured for us to follow her. At the table we ordered coffee. It was cold and we had to ask for new coffee. The food arrived really quickly. I ordered a Reuben and fries. My fries were cold and clearly not fresh. The corned beef was incredibly over cooked but surprisingly cold. Second order was chicken fried steak and eggs. The eggs were cooked correctly. The chx fried steak was obviously frozen Sysco foods product. The kicker? The hash browns were as cold as the French fries. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. The food was delicious and the server was engaging and funny. Perfect way to say goodbye to Phoenix till next year. We will eat here again when we are back in town."}
{"text":"I came here with my family Saturday morning for breakfast because I craved something delicious and I honestly didn't want to cook.   We arrived to a very busy place, just as I expected. However, the wait time wasn't bad at all.  My wife had the chicken fried steak. It was a generous portion that actually caught my interest. Unfortunately for me, there was no going near her plate.  I had the huevos rancheros with the diced potatoes. I will say that the diced potatoes are much better than their hash browns. The meal overall was very well done and I cleaned the plate.   I won't go into the Mickey pancake my daughter had because it is a pancake. However the bacon she had on the side with it was off. I can't put my finger on it exactly, but something about it didn't seem right. None of us had more than a bite of it.  Overall this is a great breakfast place and we will return."}
{"text":"Great service & friendly staff. If you're looking for a nice sized breakfast at a cheap price, this is it!!  Went here on a Sunday at 1:30 & were seated right away. Our server was friendly & all smiles, & the rest of the staff was quick to refill drinks.  We ordered eggs benedict & the food came out nice & hot with a TON of hollaindaise! Theres nothing I hate more than when restaurants are stingy with the sauce. Everything was flavorful & the portion of food was big!  They also support local businesses :)  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast stop. Super at getting people seated & orders taken. Coffee refills are quick! The food is very good...the only reason for 4 stars is that the gravy is so typically Arizona bland! Are there any good biscuit and yummy sausage gravy places in Phoenix?"}
{"text":"Is The Place fancy or someplace a foodie is going to post pictures to Instagram? No.  Is it awesome? yes.   Good eggs, biscuits, hash browns all of it. I first fell in love with the location near the NAU campus in Flagstaff.  Now I go to this one any time I can.    The Place is exactly what a breakfast diner should be.  Thanks Mike and Rhonda for doing it the old fashioned way.  Only complaint is that there are not breakfast cocktails.  4.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"We came for lunch recently while visiting.  We were seated promptly, the waiter was friendly, our service was good and our food was delicious.  My husband I and weren't super hungry so we split the steak salad.  Even with a split, the salad was huge!  There's no way I could have eaten it by myself.  And it was delicious.  I'll definitely go back when I visit again."}
{"text":"Yum!  The build a burrito is awesome.  The kids meals...Mickey pancakes with fresh fruit are great"}
{"text":"I can not tell you when I first started going to \"The Place\", however I was young and dumb and crazy about skiing! Of course I am talking about the place in Flagstaff. We would always stop there before hitting the slopes to carb up for the long day of skiing. It is the best comfort food breakfast place, with hash browns hanging over the plate. You have a choice of a huge stack of flapjacks or biscuits and gravy that would drop the jaw of any cowboy! A rock climber would look at these biscuits and try to figure out a route to the top, they are that BIG and fresh!! The Place needs no ambience it is turn and burn dinner style that befits the comfort food it serves! I have tried the one on Bell road for lunch and they maintained the comfort food quality and huge quantities at a great price! The ambiance is a step up from Flag but who cares the food to price value is unbeatable!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've only been here for breakfast but their hash browns are delicious. If you are a biscuits and gravy fan this is your place they are huge. Service is fast and friendly. Not to mention their serving sizes are more than generous."}
{"text":"Was not a fan... Our server looked like she hadn't bathed in a few days and kept going behind the hostess stand to look through her purse for some axe body spray. One of the other servers was eating French fries off of another employees plate that was sitting at a small bar area. Got the hamburger because nothing else looked promising at all. it would've been better if i just went to mcdonalds. This was my first time going there, and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The recommended quiche special was not up to par. The crust was soggy and the quiche itself rubbery. And the potatoes burned and dry. The waiter was unconcerned what I expressed my disappointment with the food. The manager I spoke to also seemed uninterested."}
{"text":"Tried this place for breakfast and the portions were generous and the food seemed like it was homemade. Hard to find these days. The coffee was pretty decent too! The service was good."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars because mostly all the servers have bitch face. The bartender was behind the bar and when I looked at her she rolled her eyes. Sorry ladies but find a new job since you seem to not like the one your working at.  Oh and you really should do a two minute check back on all your tables."}
{"text":"Really like this establishment. Price is very reasonable, enjoyable and plenty to eat. I make it a routine whenever I go up north to snowboard, I always eat at The Place there. So happy they have several down here closer to home.  Friendly service and I thoroughly liked their fried steak meal with hash browns and biscuits and gravy. Fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, each time has been excellent! While everything on the menu is amazing, don't leave without at least viewing their biscuits or at least ordering their biscuits and gravy. If you have a choice between Denny's or Rhonda's, then pick this place because you can always goto Denny's, but nothing is quite like\"The Place\". A special thank you to the manager who greeted myself and my guests."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in town!  Spicy Bloody Mary,  Biscuts and Gravy, steak strips, pancakes,  french toast, all my faves!"}
{"text":"The place has a major bug problem. We went in the other day expecting good food based on reviews and I have to admit, it was just mediocre at best. As far as the bug problem mentioned above, it's beyond disgusting. Flying gnats everywhere. They were all over our food. Crawling all over our legs as well. When we told the waitress about the problem, she just said it was an issue with some sort of construction going on across the street. No offer to comp the meal or at least have a manager come by and discuss the issue either. I am very disappointed and would have loved to give a great review, but it was all too much and fell very short."}
{"text":"Super attentive staff is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of this place. It's a cute little diner with the usual stuff. We stopped in for breakfast and they have a whole spread of stuff to choose from. I got the short stack and it looked kind of big lol. The prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was really hopping for a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"We have come here several times and the food has always been good, service is quick and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"Great place and never disappointed here. Food was awesome and the portions are huge. Service was also spot on. I used the Yelp feature to save a spot in line before driving over which saved a long wait. If you are going on a weekend or holiday, that's a must otherwise you will have a 30-45 min wait for a table if you walk in an get on the list. Lots of staff working and all very attentive to customers. I've been to both locations (Phoenix and Flagstaff) and both are solid choices for a meal at any day part."}
{"text":"The food here is really only 3 stars.  It's okay but not nearly as good as I expected from such a hyped place.  I swear NoPho people act like this is the greatest addition since Arrowhead.  I was expecting a Matt's-like meal and I got some of the lamest \"texas french toast\" I've ever seen.  It wasn't bad tasting by any means but I've had better french toast sticks from Burger King.  What makes it a 4-star experience is the service.  Not only do they run through tables at a breakneck pace but they also have attentive and helpful servers who can carry 12 plates on each arm.  These octopus servers at least gave me something to watch after I finished my child-sized french toast.    I might go back and try something more greasy-spoon but for now, I'd rather just go to the Black Bear Diner down the road."}
{"text":"Only been here for breakfast a few time. Food and service are excellent. I would highly recommend. We have a 1-year-old and they are always very sweet with her. love this place"}
{"text":"I am writing this review for lunch:  The other day for work a few of us went to The Place for lunch.  I had the Avocado burger and fries.  I can't say anything about this burger was really good or bad.  It was just an average burger with average fries.    My coworkers ordered another burger that looked average and a club sandwich that looked like any other club sandwich you get at a diner.    I don't see the why the great reviews for this place but I guess I will have to try it for breakfast to see what the fuss is about."}
{"text":"We had a very large group for a birthday party. The food was excellent and the service was even better. You really should try this place!"}
{"text":"This place was crazy busy on a Saturday before Father's day.  The staff were amazing.  They blew me away how they handled business like this.  You wouldn't know there was 20 plus people waiting to get in with no let up in sight.  Breakfast food was super yummy.  I had chicken fried steak skillet.  If I ever get a chance to come back I am going to get this again but sub gravy for their green chili.  I think that would be the bomb."}
{"text":"Really generous portions at reasonable prices and lots of options like any diner.  Fantastic buiscuits (home made) and pancakes and breakfast of any sort. Very Diner.  Looking at some of the less positive reviews -  If you're looking for an upscale brunch place with a great view, overly priced food, and fru fru portions with unnecessarily fancy food, and fancy drinks - this place is not for you.  If you're looking for generous portions, casual diner, relaxed setting, and homestyle food - then this might be what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Great food with good service. Had their meat and eggs meal with corned beef hash and pancakes. They give you A LOT of food for a decent price!  Totally would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it has always been so good to me! I love coming here for the 16oz steak! YummyYumYum!!! The steak is cooked just the way I order it and it is seasoned well. Ask for your hash to be more crispy to get that extra crunch!  Do come a little early because you will probably find yourself waiting...there is always a line! But the food is great and the workers are friendly. This place is packed to it's max! Meaning...you'll be closely sitting to some stranger...but if you sit outside (since the weather is so lovely) you'll have more elbow room."}
{"text":"Yep, inside will remind you of the diners of old, the biscuit is a misnomer in that it is a soft roll, had mine with a jalapeño cream sauce this was ok sauce was super thick, the multigrain pancake had nice flavor, and the corned beef hash was nice and crispy."}
{"text":"Well what can I say. It's pretty solid food. I'm not going to rate my overall experience on this visit as I was a bit frustrated. I'll explain later. We come here often or should I say try too as the weekend wait time is usually crazy. They have a great breakfast and the biscuit are huge. Pancakes are huge as well. But like I said the wait time is usually very long. Usually have solid service and food comes out prompt and good. Now on to today. Just a minor gripe but I seem to notice it more and more in restaurants. I was a here alone for lunch. They asked where I wanted to sit after trying several times to get me to sit at the bar. I felt like they didn't want me taking up a booth. They have very small 2 man booths that I usually sit at but for some reason today they sat me by a huge party with screaming kids. Also note there where 3 open 2 man booths on the other side of the restaurant. The party soon left and the noise left dropped for a second. Once they left the bus boy came and that's when I about jumped out of my skin. When he was sweeping he was banging the broom  into the dust pan so loud it would make you jump. He was slamming the table extenders close as well. I just wanted to chill and relax on my lunch. Not listen to slamming tables and brooms. With that said I know he was trying to be efficient and get the tables cleaned as fast as possible but dang. Even my waitress noticed how loud he was. Overall service was good, food was good and price is good. I'll be back but I'll speak up next time and sit in smaller booth in a much quieter area."}
{"text":"We went early; around 8am.  Everything from the wait, service, to the food was fantastic.  We waited 10ish min. Just a tip; any later would have prolonged the wait. Our waitress Jackie was great. She was informative, upbeat, and consistent.  We didn't have to look for her which is extremely important to us!  Our drinks were kept full the entire time.   Nothing but 5 from us."}
{"text":"Went for Breakfast and had the ham and cheese omelet. It was on the menu as an \"Insert Name I Forgot Here\" omelet which included peppers, but I'm not a fan so those were nixed. Everything needed ALOT of salt. I literally drowned the hash browns in salt just to give them some small semblance of flavor. Biscuits from the \"biscuits and gravy\" were all wrong and very dry. Wife had the breakfast burrito with one meat and 3 options. She liked it, but could only finish half. It was big and they do serve large portions, so go hungry, just don't expect anything above average as far as taste goes. BTW- I am someone who NEVER uses tobasco sauce (on anything), yet I found myself pouring it over the entire plate. You were warned."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. This is your standard breakfast joint. This place is ALWAYS busy in the morning, and there is usually a line out the door on weekends. Everything I've had on the menu is good but my favorites are the steak tips, pancakes and french toast. I'd say I like this place better than IHOP and its comparable to cracker barrel. Good prices, usually fast service, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and very friendly and fast service!  I had the carne asada skillet special. The sauce was great and the eggs were cooked perfectly to order."}
{"text":"Excellent place overall to get some great breakfast. The food here is really good. Nice warm feeling atmosphere to it. They have a bar for all you daytime drinkers. Anytime you are looking for good breakfast they can provide."}
{"text":"Best breakfast restaurant I've tried in Phoenix! Good prices and big portions! We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I had the cinnamon roll, it was pretty damn good.  Overall decent food and decent service. Interesting crowd."}
{"text":"I went here the other day with the BF and Erin B. and her BF and it just did not live up to expectations... maybe I had too high expectations, but this is not a place I would suggest in the future. Three of us got make your own omelets... and maybe I am just crappy at making an omelet, but it was not awesome. I got it with chicken, cheddar, broccoli, onion, and avocado..... The chicken tasted like it was once frozen OR it had been cooked long ago.... plus it had no seasoning. There were very few pieces of broccoli and both it and the avocado were not very fresh tasting... kind of mushy. The BF got the biscuits and gravy and he said it was alright, but not his favorite. The gravy was a bit watery and the biscuits are huge! Too huge. They didn't cook all the way inside. The good parts were the diced potatoes were crispy and tasty... they had a nice seasoning blend on them and the toast was fine. Also, the coffee was good... nice and strong. Maybe we just went on an off day... but it was not worth the money (25$ for the omelet, biscuits, coffee and a side of bacon) in my opinion.... Phoenix has a lot of exceptional breakfast options.... and this one is just ok."}
{"text":"The food is not that good anymore , went for breakfast today, the hash browns tasted like old oil from the griddle, one of my easy over eggs was broken open, they hide it by putting the English muffin on top and the what was terrible"}
{"text":"I ate here last week and had really high expectations due to the reviews but it was just ok. I would say 3.5 stars. There's a wait but that's expected for Saturday brunch. The service was good. People constantly walk around to fill your coffee which is nice. If you're a coffee snob though, it's just basic coffee.  I ended up getting the French Toast with bacon & hashbrowns. I really wanted the special offered, it was like a skillet with brisket, eggs and some other stuff that sounded amazing. I don't eat eggs so I asked if I could sub for potatoes or just not have them but the waiter mentioned it was sort of pre made so they couldn't make adjustments which seemed weird to me. The portions are huge! The French toast was blah, the hashbrowns weren't cooked well but the bacon was delish!   It won't be my go to spot but I might try it again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Well priced! Awesome food. Great service. They serve alcohol/full bar. Homey feel to it! What else could you want?"}
{"text":"Oh em geee! The breakfast and service here are both outstanding! The food, the food... you guessed it the food. Thick smoked bacon, hot eggs and cheessseeee, biscuits and gravy (sausage gravy) yummmm the bar makes amazing bloody Mary's and mimosa! Don't forget to ask for your hash browns to be deep fried... yes, i said deep fried hash browns. (Wayyy better than extra crispy.) all of the staff are very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, slight step up from Denny's. The biscuits were made from bisquick , there was no sausage in the anemic gravy and the chicken fried steak was just breaded hamburger. The Apple Danish was good though."}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it the food is so good the price is affordable the biscuit and gravy are outstanding can't wait to come back. The French dip was awesome good flavors in the sandwich.  We loved our server Kayla she was so nice and very attentive"}
{"text":"Wow this place has really good breakfast. My food was hot and came out promptly. The Bloody Mary was meh but I was ok with that at 9am ha ha. The food didn't need any extra seasoning or cook time. The waitresses were pretty and polite. Prices were extremely competitive."}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT! Biscuits the size of your first and if you like a little spice be sure to ask for the Jalapeno Sausage Gravy for like a quarter more. Fat thick strips of bacon and pancakes the size of a small child. Also they serve Orange Juice by the gallon (well almost, they offer up to a 32 oz) Friendly staff and I knew the moment we got there it was going to be good because there was up to a 45 minute. There is always a wait and a gaggle of people waiting outside whenever I have driven by in the past."}
{"text":"Was a regular at the old M&R's in the corner of 51st and Bell.  Loved this place and it was a weekly brunch place for my family.  So much so that after my wife and I got married (east valley wedding midweek) we ate at M&Rs because we were too tired to cook (reception was later in the weekend).  When they moved to a larger location we were assured that \"regulars\" would still have a place.  Yes we waited in line like everyone else, but the personal service was what we loved.  I can get eggs anywhere,  this place had a family feel.  We were assured that that was going no where and was what the place was built on.  Unfortunately it looks like M&Rs has gotten too big for its britches.  The last few times we have been in the feel of the place was gone.  Compared to Denny's the service and food were fine.  But knowing how it was it was a sharp decline in all categories.  I do wish them the best and see a line outside every morning.  But for the same service and prices I'll go down the street to Denny's with no wait.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"We have our bi-monthly marketing meetings here. The staff already knows my name (I've been there 3 or 4 times), they know what I like to drink (soda water with hunks of lime) but they still call all of us \"babe\" or \"sugar\" or \"honey\". I like that.  Great portions. I always get the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits are HUGE and I never finish them, because they come as a side with my breakfast. Go reallllllllllllllllllly early (be there BY 7!) to get a table without waiting. Food is breakfast food, but it's generous. My waffle was as big as my plate. The has browns take up half my plate. The biscuits, huge (can you tell I really like the biscuits???). I haven't had the pancakes, but I've seen them and the stack is huge. Big food. Awesome servers. Decent prices.  It's like eating at Mel's Diner and you get your very own Flo. Without the gum behind the ear.  (They've moved to Bell & 51st Ave)"}
{"text":"It is no surprise they are packed on Sunday, super nice real people, not the fake nice people fearful of management, but good people, excellent portions (I have an appetite and usually leave with left leftovers) and well made comfort food. Thank you for giving a single diner the comfort to dine alone."}
{"text":"We live in Scottsdale and  we will gladly make the drive, because this food is so amazing and the staff is super friendly. Not to mention, clean and efficient!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better places in the area. Their Biscuits by far best option. Food quality is lacking. Potatoes from frozen bag ect... Peaches from a can but decent. Just wish it was more fresh maybe make your own whipped cream. The idea is good but just not quite there. Coffee good, clean place, good service."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food and service. We seem to always wait for a table which can be good and bad. Probably because they give you good portions for the money and the bacon at breakfast is cripsy and good. Had their fish fry once as well and found it tasty and you can get as much as you want. Recommend."}
{"text":"The most important thing (in my opinion) that makes a breakfast restaurant good is their willingness to accommodate substitutions. Any restaurant with a \"no substitution\" policy is officially off my list. But fortunately for me, Mike and Ronda's The Place has a very generous substitution policy.   I ordered the Build Your Own Omelet, which comes with meat of your (assuming you eat meat), cheese and veggies of your choice. My waitress was more than happy to add as many veggies as necessary to compensate for my lack of meat. And after the omelet, there were hashbrowns and toast. I swear, the food just wouldn't end! And the hashbrowns are the really good kind, like you would get at IHOP or Denny's. That's right, the REALLY good kind!!  The service was great, the food was even better, and the menu has tons of options. If you're searching for breakfast in the west valley, you're making a huge mistake if you don't opt for The Place."}
{"text":"I've been to this location under another name. Several restaurants have occupied this building, but Mike and Ronda have done it right!  I had the special Lemon Bread French Toast with Blueberries. YUM!!  The perfect amount of sweet, tart, and savory.   This place isn't overly fancy, the service is attentive and friendly, solid menu, and a full bar.  The salty dogs with breakfast were excellent; they pack a punch with missing any flavor.  A definite do-again.  With tip, the whole meal for me and two boys was $45.58.  Nobody left hungry."}
{"text":"Place is a little over rated, always busy but when your alternative is ihop or village in, this place is a better option. The service is pretty standard, bacon is great, there are worse places to go for breakfast. Staff is friendly. Place is just crowded."}
{"text":"I've been eating breakfast at Mike and Ronda's since 2001 in Flag and in Phx and have had no complaints as of yet ... well I have one, the crowd ! Holy Crap that crowd that loves a great breakfast as well, lol The staff bust there butts, thats why your food gets to your table fast and coffee is always full and the check is always reasonable. Great place"}
{"text":"Our first visit, very crowded, busy place. Food was good but charges for everything extra. Called for onion rings, asked for a sauce on the side, charged $0.90 for that. Shortage of silverware, food on the table but silverware took its own time to come. Coffee was good here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better customer service. Holly is the best great attitude great service she's great fast and remembers you. I became a regular because of the service and because of the steak and eggs. Great food great price. Gets a little packed but worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Would you like to be full after eating? Come here.  Would you like a nice dining experience and good food? Meh. I've experienced better elsewhere.  Went here first time this past weekend. Met friends to catch-up and have a nice breakfast as a start to a relaxing weekend.   Our server was very warm, friendly and engaging...with customers she knew. Our first time here her table skills were like talking to Joe Friday - just the facts. Questions were answered with an impatient attitude. Yes, I know she was busy, but we still had questions. She did tell us the morning specials and no other suggestions was offered. Not even upselling or suggestive selling side items (play 'Price is Right' loser music for the empty cash register).  Our coffee cups were never empty thanks to an army of people working the floor. That's a good thing! Coffee was on the weak side, if you like it that way.   Barely half way through our meal, maybe 40 minutes from the time we sat down, plates still loaded, EVERYONE working the floor offered us to-go boxes and to-go cups of coffee. \"Everyone\" means at least six different servers with our server asking multiple times. So much for a relaxing breakfast.   There was a lot of food and the taste was comparable to any national chain restaurant.   Glad I tried it. Not sure if it's worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Normally love this place.  But last Saturday (6/18) I experienced the worst customer service. Was having a baby shower breakfast that Saturday morning and had called early to order over $100 worth of bacon and French toast. They said it would be ready for pickup at 8, after a morning of everything going wrong I was relieved to know the food was gonna be ready at 8. Walk into to find out that they completely forgot about my order all together. The manager didn't even try to comp the meal, or anything of the sort. She only offered to pay me OUT OF HER POCKET! extremely unprofessional, and I'm positive she was doing that because she didn't want to get caught by HER manager for such a huge mistake.  Had to wait another 15-20 minutes for food. And still NO DISCOUNT OR COMP OF THE MEAL for any of this.  Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and quick service! Tried going 3 other times but the wait was too much, now I know why theres a wait! Great food, huge portions, and reasonable prices. Definitely a reccomendation for anyone."}
{"text":"Amazing food and QUICK! If you come here don't miss out on the biskets and gravy or the sausage links! If you come during prime breakfast hours don't be bothered by the short wait you might incur it will be way worth it they have a full house for a reason!"}
{"text":"East Coast breakfasts served up here, in more ways than one.  There are a few southern breakfast items, but largely this is where you go for your 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and choice of meat.  Modest, casual atmosphere that screams diner to you, and normally the service is quite friendly.  Pancakes or French Toast are my regular picks, and I never miss the hashbrowns on the side with a bottomless cup of coffee.  Reasonable prices.  Located in a small corner of a strip mall, SE corner of interesection.  Avoid rush hour times for breakfast, especially weekends."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, atmosphere was cozy, and service was awesome. This place is a very nice restaurant. I didn't have one complaint."}
{"text":"OMG I JUST CAME FROM \"THE PLACE\"...  And I'm stufffffed! EXCELLENT TASTING, BIG PORTIONS OF FOOD! EXCELLENT FAST SERVICE! PRICES WERE REASONABLE! I only had to wait 10 minutes for a table.. not bad!  And so well worth it! The only reason they don't get a five star is because they don't serve alcohol...  I love a bloody mary or a mimosa with my brunch!  But this is definitely a favorite for me... It's only like 2 miles from my home too, so awesome!"}
{"text":"What in the love do you put on your bacon? Stop by this morning with my daughter a.k.a. foodie in training and we shared a waffle breakfast that came with eggs and bacon. The waffle is really good , the eggs nice and fresh and cooked perfectly. The bacon had a little bit of a sweet hint of maybe brown sugar or something all I know is it was incredibly good. I think you guys found a regular! Yummy!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews was expecting a lot more from The Place. Coffee was very average as well as service. Had a very odd interaction with our waitress and felt awkward ordering. Food was very average and not what it was cracked up to be. Would go to many other breakfast places in the area over come back here."}
{"text":"We've tried breakfast and dinner here--mediocre. We've also eaten at the location in Flagstaff for breakfast. Also mediocre. Service is good, but the food certainly leaves something to be desired. Very small menu selection for any meal and nothing worthy of the prices they're charging. Very disappointing for as much as it's been hyped up--we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, the staff is great and food is awesome. Their biscuits are AMAZING! Also they were very nice to my grandma and made sure she was in a seat that was easy for her and they put her walker up so that others weren't tripping over it"}
{"text":"I wanted to mention that my rating does not mean that this is a fancy joint but this place stands out amongst similar restaurants.  First off the line to be seated is usually long if that tells you anything.  The breakfasts are HUGE and delicious though simple.  The hash browns are perfectly crispy and the omelet I ate was fluffy and tasty with fresh items.  I enjoyed a nice cup of fruit which I opted to finish over the massive biscuits with gravy.  I love breakfast and this place left me full and content.  I suppose my only complaint would be the fact that they put four of us in a tiny little booth when there were larger tables which were occupied by a couple of people.  $40 fed four people which seems to be a rarity these days if you want decent food.."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast and lunch place.  It was very busy but the service was fast and extremely friendly.  The salad I had was a large portion but fresh and dressing on the side.  I appreciated not having to ask for it on the side.  Prices are good as well.  The only problem a fly that was merciless in buzzing us."}
{"text":"So my husband daughter and I went here on a Sunday.  Little did we know that it was supposed to close only 10 minutes after we arrived.  They were gracious and fed us well anyway. My husband got the double burger with fries and salad.  Let's just say the man can eat a lot but was not able to finish his portion no matter how badly he wanted to.  The fries were perfect and the burger was gone. My daughter got the Arizona omelet with hashbrowns and pancakes.  She is not a big eater but quickly finished her omelet and one of the pancakes that was bigger than her head.  She decided to take the other pancake and her hashbrowns home.  I got the burrito with spinach, sour cream, mushrooms, and cheddar cheese.  I couldn't believe how light and fluffy the eggs were and how perfectly blended the ingredients were.  The meal was fantastic.  I was extremely surprised at how good the food and service was even though we came at closing time.  The staff was the best and we kinda got taken care of by everyone.  I am going back there again but hopefully not as a nuisance."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the Mike & Ronda's in Flagstaff and we stop there every time we're in town. So excited that they have one here in Phoenix and close to our home.  I love the wood cabin feel as though we're back in Flagstaff.  Food here is great and quite abundant.  They have a 30 oz orange juice that I thought I could finish - but didn't realize how much 30 oz. really was!  I always order their eggs benedict - easy eggs with a side of hash browns.  It has never disappointed.  The hubs always gets the steak (medium rare) and eggs and I always steal a few pieces of his steak.  Definitely a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"It is okay. Super cute diner. It is really a three and a half star rating. Way too packed the day I went and I sat at the bar. I do not like to do that. This place is more for breakfast and if you like to eat a lot of food. Since I like neither I ordered lunch. I had the Patty Melt which was very good actually. I would give the melt a fourth star. Service was slow but they were packed. Tavern type of decor. I really enjoyed chatting with some of the regulars and the server behind the bar, who is also a manager. (Sorry I did not get her name) was fantastic.   Pros- if you like large plates and breakfast come by or for sharing. I might come by again with a friend and do that.   Cons- coffee is not very good. It is expensive for a lunch at a diner experience. The lunch is not a large platter enough for two so 16 bucks was steep in my opinion.   I would come back but it is nothing to write home about. The place is way too crowded and the wait is long. I guess that is good for them but I prefer a less noisy and stressful eating experience.  I would say check it out and make your own determination. I have friends who love it. While I did not dislike the Place I did not love it either. It was kind of, \" Eh\" if someone invited me again I would not hesitate to go but I would not go out of my way either with so many other good places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious ! I had the 7oz sirloin strips with green Chile smothered all over my has browns. Hug biscuits and the gravy was so delicious. I give this place 10 starts! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I guess I expected too much when we came here because I was just a little less than impressed.  I LOVE breakfast food.  In fact, aside from dessert, it's definitely my favorite meal of the day.  Unfortunately I just wasn't blown away with this restaurant.  The interior is kinda bad.  The furniture/booths all look like they came from a 70's diner and there is also a really bad tile job done on the walls.  It looks like it belongs in a cheap Italian restaurant, not a diner.  All the tables are extremely close too, but I don't mind that.  I say maximize your space when you can.  Just be warned if you freak out when people are close to your personal space.  The menu is relatively varied and the prices are all fair.  I was, however, a little surprised at 3.50 for a side of bacon.  For my breakfast, I got a Belgian Waffle (on the menu it says Belgium Waffle and I laughed) and a side of bacon.  The waffle was tasty and quite fluffy.  It was served with two types of syrups, regular maple and a blueberry.  Both were delicious.  The bacon was good, but the ends were strangely \"beef-jerky\" like.  Overall, my meal was good and filling.  Service was pretty much on par with any breakfast/diner place.  They took your order, brought your food and drinks, and then pretty much left you alone after that.  That's always a good thing at breakfast, because I don't really like to linger.  The Place isn't bad but it isn't my favorite either."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place because I always see people waiting outside, so I figured it must be great!     Living in Sedona for 14 years we ate often at the Coffee Pot Restaurant and were used to eating an amazing breakfast. I assumed this place was going to be like that and was excited to try it.    Sadly, we were disappointed.    We both ordered pancakes.  Mine came underdone and his came overdone .  I am not even sure how a cook can do that. I brought some home so my doggie could eat some - she loves pancakes, you can see the difference in color and texture.    My eggs were \"shiny\", aka underdone - I hate that.  I asked the server if they could just cook them a tad more and he said yes.  But, a runner brought me back another plate of under cooked eggs.  I didn't eat them or bring them home.   So, while the bacon was cooked perfectly, overall it was inconsistent and did not make a good first impression."}
{"text":"Busiest breakfast joint on the westside! We had to wait an hour to get seated. It was worth every minute of the wait. The portions are huge, the food tastes like homemade and the service is outstanding. Whether you're in Flagstaff or Phoenix, this is THE place to eat breakfast"}
{"text":"Pretty good, I've definitely had better.  9:00am on a Saturday and we were sat immediately.  It took less than five minutes for our food to arrive.  Terrible coffee and the blueberry syrup tasted like Dimetapp but the sausage gravy was pretty good and the breakfast potatoes were tasty although I know they came from a bag.  It's an average place but if you love big portions and aren't expecting five star food then check it out."}
