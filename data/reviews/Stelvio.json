{"text":"One time thing for me. Dont think i will be returning. Went on a Saturday night, service was a little slow.  They have a cute patio and dining atmosphere.  Menu and alcohol are a little bit pricey."}
{"text":"Being brought up in a Northern Italian household, I would say the dishes are quite accurate to the cuisine! Different from your typical Italian restaurants in the best way. I was excited to see buckwheat dishes as well as polenta. The atmosphere is modern and the food is nostalgic. Great combination. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The service here is attentive and friendly. I've been twice and both times our server has helped us with recommendations and answered our questions about the food and drinks.  The food is spectacular. My wife and I have tried 4 different fresh pasta dishes and they have all been extremely tasty. We also tried the polenta toasts; highly recommended.  The portions were a perfect size for us. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My expectations for this place were pretty high, considering the previous reviews. The restaurant itself is really lovely - the decor is beautiful. I was disappointed with the service and food, however. There was only one waitress for the entire restaurant including the patio, so service was incredibly slow and the waitress kept forgetting things (I don't blame her, it was just way too many tables for one person to handle). My friend had their signature pasta dish, the pizzoccheri, which was good, but my braised beef with polenta, while beautifully presented, was incredibly underseasoned and pretty much flavourless. Maybe I just went on an off night, but I was pretty underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Amy was great. As a normal guy looking for something tasty and filling this place met that. Staff was great, food was tasty and I didn't leave hungry. Gents, it's a good place to take your date."}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal we had on vacation. My Oso buco was fantastic and the gnocchi were the fluffiest I've ever had.  The staff was so so so nice it was like having dinner at a friends home. They gave me an aperitif and after my daughter raved about the gnocchi, the chef came out and wrote down the recipe for her and explained step by step how to make it. It's that kind of nice touch that made it one of my most memorable meals ever. We'll take pictures and post them when we get home and make gnocchi."}
{"text":"Come here at 5:25 on a Sunday night, the restaurant was not packed at that moment while some time later it was literally full of guests! The food are overall great, while the speed of serving is a little bit slow, since it is a small scale restaurant , it kinda makes sense. The zucca is absolutely fantastic!! The pumpkin filling is  so sweet and creamy to taste while the outer pasta is not too thick or hard , but offer a considerably suitable accompanying for the general texture! The risotto is gigantic in portion, the meat is so tender and the rice is right in cook, I normally would not like to order a risotto , but it is my type. The meat sauce pasta is great in flavor , the server asked me if i would like to add the tomato sauce into that, I said yes! why not? However, the gnocchi is too soft in texture that is even become marshy in your mouth and the sauce is too salty in my opinion. I would not recommend it for sure.They do offer the free pre-meal bread with the preserved olive and the olive oil with balsamic vinegar to dip. Definitely remember to ask them more vinegar since it is sooooo good! The plate of cured meat with cheese is nice, but the meat might can be more in varieties. The pickled veggies on the side is so much tasty! The salad is just a normal one, which is not that recommend one. The last but not the least, the deep fried buckwheat cheese balls are great, they are crispy outside and gooey inside, you can clearly taste the cheese aroma but not that overwhelming to make you feel sick! The atmosphere is pretty adorable that is kinda instagramable lolllll!"}
{"text":"For authentic northern Italian cuisine including delicious homemade pastas, friendly, attentive service and a nice atmosphere, Stelvio is the place to go.  They were very flexible and patient as we asked numerous questions and made a few substitutions.  Great drink selection too."}
{"text":"Cool setting and attentive service. A great addition to Queen W. culinary experience. As owners proudly shout it is not a \"me too!\" offering. It is uniquely dedicated to a single region with its menu and wine list, Valtellina of Northern Italy. Tried Pizzaoccheri di Teglio, the signature dish upon recommendation of the waitress. It was absolutely yummy. Homemade fresh short tagliatelle with Valtellina cheese, cabbage, cube potatoes, fresh sage and garlic with generous amount of butter. Wines are of Rivetti & Lauro, the iconic producer of Nebbiolo wines. I was most pleased of seeing their 2010 UI Valtellina Superiore DOCG on the wine list, the wine decorated with the prestigious Regional Trophy award in Decanter 2014 that I tasted earlier with a great admiration. Unfortunately it was my brief lunch stop. Soon will be back for food and but also wines.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went out for Italian Date Night and were so pleased with this restaurant and the staff. We ordered a couple traditional northern Italian dishes (buckwheat pasta and polenta dishes). They were beautiful but not what we were expecting. The waiter came right over and explained what we had ordered and graciously offered to get us two new plates of something more standard. We really enjoyed the pasta he brought out next and really appreciated his efforts to help, even though there was nothing technically wrong with the first dishes. A beautiful restaurant, great staff and great food. Just have the staff walk you through the menu to help you make an educated choice. After such a great experience, we will be back soon I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner after a long day of film watching at the TIFF festival. Chic but friendly place with patio seating, which was wonderful to enjoy on a warm late-summer evening. I had the house-made gnocchi which was just delicious! The pomodoro sauce was fresh and bright. A lovely plate of country bread, olives and dipping oil come with the meal so I skipped the appetizer. Server was very welcoming, attentive and knowledgeable about the food and wine on the menu. I enjoyed a glass of Italian red with my meal but they also have some yummy looking cocktails from what I could see on the table next to me. Price was very reasonable. Good experience all around and I look forward to dining there again next year when I return to Toronto for the 2018 film festival."}
{"text":"This place is critically underrated. I was seriously surprised how few people were here on a Sunday night. What I really appreciate about this place is that the pasta is always made fresh daily! For this reason, I always have the Gnocchi with tomato sauce and basil. The only thing I will say is that the staff is, at times, quite aloof. However, I definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"The service was great. We went on a Monday night but wasn't busy so we had lots of time to chat with the staff. He was very knowledgeable and took the time to explain the particularities of this very authentic Northern Italian menu.  The fried Milano meatballs were very good and so was the wine. The server explained that they are the only ones who serve this particular red wine.  The polenta fries were fantastic and the rest of the food was great.  They have a great patio right on Queen which makes for a great dinner setting."}
{"text":"Really cool place. It's got an antique feel. The food was excellent. They started off with a plate of bread and olive oil, which was pretty good. I had a risotto and I thought it was really good at first, but it got old about halfway through.   The waitress was really nice and friendly.   The bathrooms aren't that great though. They're really small, the toilet paper had a weird dispenser and there was no paper towels.  Great place though!"}
{"text":"-Great food, the pasta was very fresh and tasty.  -Good ambiance and not very noisy.  -It was our first time visiting, the server was quite friendly, she walked us through the menu and gave us some recommendations.  -The chef came out to ask how we liked the food which I considered a nice touch. -We spent about $60 for an appetizer and 2 mains, we were quite satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"I spent my 24th birthday at Stelvio last weekend and it was an excellent experience! Janine (the manager) was so accommodating of our large group (20 people) and gave us the best service. My party and I enjoyed the Northern Italian cuisine! The bartender made one my cousins a special surprise cocktail that was great. The waitress as well made our party feel so comfortable and attended to all questions that we had. I wish I remembered her name but you could see her passion when speaking with us about the menu, etc. The decor of the restaurant is so classy and makes for a perfect fine dining night."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 8.5/10 Food: 8/10 Atmosphere: 8.5/10 Service: 9/10  Authentically Italian all around.   The staff, the food, even the wine, is as Italian as you're going to find in Toronto. Wine is imported directly from Italy (not even available at the LCBO), the staff will converse with you in Italian, and the way the menu is set up is genuine. There are no massive pasta bowls you'll enjoy, but rather apps, a small pasta or risotto course, and then your main meat dish.   The food here is good - but the flavours will be different than what you may have experienced. As my very Italian friend explained, Stelvio's palette stems from northern Italy, whereas Roman or southern Italian notes are more common in other eateries.   THE BOTTOM LINE: a lovely, genuinely Italian place with good food. Worth checking out!  PRO TIP: if you like olives in even the slightest, get them here. They are divine!"}
{"text":"Great service, but don't come here if you're hungry and looking for a big Italian dinner. Portion sizes were very very small... I guess I'm used to Italian restaurants stuffing you to the brim. This is one of those establishments where you're just looking for a taster of northern Italian cuisine... But none of the dishes impressed me. Wasn't disappointed either. Just unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"This is hands down the most authentic and best Italian restaurant in all of Toronto. You'll even hear Italian being spoken at the tables around you and the waiters are from Italy themselves. The food is authentic, fresh and delicious. One of my fav places in the city!"}
{"text":"The staff was great but the food was overall too rich, salty, and creamy. The quality of ingredients was great - the food was fresh and the pasta was handmade. The bread and olives were fresh and tasty. The food was disappointing when compared to quality Italian food in other cities. We had the meatballs (alright but nothing special), the buckwheat noodles (extremely cheesy, rich, couldn't finish) and the risotto with lamb (yummy lamb cooked flavorfully but the risotto was too salty and rich). Wouldn't come back but for Toronto standards, it seems to be pretty average."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight for the first time and everything was fantastic! Delicious food, great service! :):) can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Smaaaaaall plates.  Our table of five ordered the tortelli di zucca alla mantovana (stuffed pasta), casoncelli alla bergamasca (stuffed pasta), risotto alla milanese con ossobuco, and coniglio con patate e cippola dolce al rosmarino (rabbit casserole)...and we all left needing a second meal.  Everything was tasty, and I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable the amaretti-stuffed, savoury pasta tasted.  Osso bucco was tender, and the rabbit was moist and perfectly seasoned.  But gosh, everything but the osso bucco was served in dishes no larger than tea plates.  Long story made short?  Tasty food, but I wouldn't visit again because my stomach is bigger than the size of a marble."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've written a review and I don't know what happened to my other reviews that I made on here...oh well I felt that I needed to write a review of Stelvio. First of all finding a northern Italian cuisine restaurant in Toronto is very hard to come by. Thank God my niece tagged me in a photo some time ago on Instagram of a polenta burger and that was all it took for me to start following them on Instagram and the more pics I saw I realized that I wld make it my mission to get here for dinner. Well last night was the night and Stelvio did not disappoint! if anything it went beyond what my tastebuds cld imagine!  They brought out bread olives and olive oil, that right there is the beginning of a beautiful relationship! Lol   My sister and I shared the bresaola with Parmesan cheese and polenta fries salad! Bresaola reminds me very much of prosciutto but if possible better! The polenta fries were not greasy or overly done they were perfect!  My friend wanted just a simple salad which was not offered on the menu but they were good enuf to prepare it for her.   My main course was risotto milanese with a huge piece of ossobuco that was falling apart from the bone, a knife was not needed and it melted in my mouth, the risotto was just an added incredible extra!  My friend had their notorious polenta burger, she was hesitant to order it because she is not a fan of pork but she said it was incredible and didn't even taste like pork.   Everything about this restaurant was amazing from the atmosphere to the food, of course and most importantly the service! Our server Rodrigo, straight from northern Italy was just awesome! He informed us that the cheeses and flour, like most of their products that they use in their restaurant is imported from Italy.  Overall it was beyond the experience that I thought I wld have!  Definitely going back and taking my other friends and family!  Just a side note if u want to make reservations your best bet is to email them from their website."}
{"text":"Fantastic northern Italian food, wonderfully warm service and great wine. Perfect spot for a nice long dinner with friends"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner at Stelvio. Finally an Italian restaurant that is not all about pasta with tomatoes sauce or meatballs.  We loved their brasato with polenta and the tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! The food was authentic Italian cooked to perfection and service was top class. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. My tagliatelle were heavily undercooked and my portion was surprisingly smaller than in the pictures. Not Italian approved."}
{"text":"First time I ordered the simple meat sauce pasta and was blown away. Since they make northern style pasta I found it a good change of pace to most Italian restaurants. I visited another time and was very disappointed. The pasta and risotto tasted undercooked and personally I was not a fan of the style of risotto. It seemed bland and the texture was similar to baby food while the rice was hard in the middle. I'm pretty split on this place, not sure if others had a similar experience with inconsistency but it's not something I'd look for in a recommendation."}
{"text":"Thank you! Great place, with great service and a peculiar attention to the origins of the meals and recipes... Lombardia... Fresh pasta and tasteful dishes were served with appropriate explanations.. including deserts! We've been visiting Toronto for one night, and would definitely recommend this place (about 15 mins walk from the CN tower)"}
{"text":"Food was so gooood! Love their rissoto! Got the osso buco risotto the first time, a lot of meat and very tasty. Got the sausage rissotto the second time, not much meat but still very tasty. Friends got the cheese gnocchi and it was delicious.  Restaurant was quite empty the two times we went without reservation. But for some reason the waitress kept rushing us out. They stopped refilling our water after we paid."}
{"text":"I know good food when I taste it- raised in a traditional Italian household and have graduated from culinary school and working professionally in a kitchen for a number of years. Stelvio manages to hit the nail on the head in all of the most important areas a restaurant should. The food, service and atmosphere were all excellent; the food and beverages authentic to northern Italy. The owners and most of the staff are Italian which helps with the authenticity of everything as well as the staff being knowledgable. The pastas are all hand-made and taste delicious! If you are looking for a good date spot, this place has a more casual, easy and romantic vibe.   Overall one of the best little Italian spots in the city that I have tried. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I would say first- between a 3-4 star rating.  We came for dinner on a Friday night.  We were seated right away and provided our menus.  Our server took a little while to come by, but when he did, he was great detailing the menu and wines. They bring bread and oil and olives to the table to start.  We ordered and shared the Taroz starter ( mashed potatoes mixed with green beans and cheese).  This was a very comforting starter, but lacked a little flavour given the cheese was very light. Still enjoyable. We shared the tagliatelle with Wild Boar (was the special) and the osso buco risotto. The pasta was fine, would have liked a bit more of the sauce. Overall pasta - underwhelming  Now- the osso buco .. gimme a moment!!! This mix of risotto and the sauce and meat was DELICIOUS!! It's worth the $29 price!  It's a larger serving and we took some home after!  Savoury and rich just blends so nicely .  Wine was on the pricey side ..5oz for $19  I would return for the osso buco for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I've passed this place quite a few times on my way down Queen West and it always struck me. Superficially it was the decor. I love a place that looks cozy and quaint and Stelvio definitely does.  They specialize in Northern Italian cuisine and it's a nice change from the standard run of the mill Italian food that restaurants usually have on their menus. I love the authenticity mixed with high-class dishes and plating.   We were seated right away upon arriving, which was great, despite it being a Friday night.  We ordered the sciatt (basically fried cheese balls from heaven). It's the perfect appetizer for any deep fried lover. The polenta fritters were perfectly fried, while the cheese had the most amazing melt-factor. I couldn't believe what I was tasting.   For my main I ordered the tagliatelle ai funghi porcini and again, absolutely amazing. I love that the pasta is homemade in-house and the ingredients used I could just tell were of the freshest quality.   I would definitely recommend this place! Not only is the decor amazing, giving it this cute and cozy vibe but the food exceeds what you'd think. Stelvio isn't just a pretty face on Queen West, the food actually does the talking. This would also be a prime spot for a date night.   Next time you're in the mood for Italian food but are tired of the same-y menus everywhere under the sun, hit this place up, you'll be taken on a culinary journey, exploring the Italian north."}
{"text":"What an amazing start to my weekend long trip to Toronto. I've been meaning to take my family out for a nice sit down dinner and I couldn't have picked a better place. We had an 8 pm reservation for 4, and were seated immediately, although one of my guests arrived around 30 minutes late. The setting was intimate, the decor was tasteful and the server was very pleasant! We started off with the tagliere formaggi valtellina (a plate with an assortment of DOP valtellina cheeses). The millefiori honey paired wonderfully. We shared the Dante Salad, and 3 different pasta dishes including the gnocchi al pomodoro (MY FAVORITE), the squash ravioli, and tagliatelle al ragu bianco. Every dish was impeccable. Stelvio has become my favorite restaurant in Toronto and I can't wait to go back! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"First time visitor, and I was pleased. Hopefully they have a ever changing menu to keep me curious what they'll whip up next."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and had some nice drinks, meal and desserts.   Quite a fancy place but it's decently priced for what you can call fine casual dining? The service is great and very friendly.  Not my usual type of restaurant but it was nice."}
{"text":"Nice place! Didn't think that i find a place which makes delicious italian food in kanada. :)"}
{"text":"This place is PHENOMENAL. I got the buckwheat pasta and it was out of this world. So much flavour, so many tastes. Simply amazing. I would recommend to anyone. I wish I could meet the chef! Some of the best Italian I have had."}
{"text":"The meal here was very good. The waitress was excellent and explained the various pastas and appetizers. Based on her recommendation we had the various meats and cheeses appetizer. When it was brought to us she explained the different variety of cheeses and meats. They were very good. The meals did not appear very large when they were brought out but they were very filling and we were all full at the end, so much so that we had no room for dessert. The bread with oil and balsamic vinegar as well as the olives were also very good. They are brought out while you are waiting for your meal. Overall, a restaurant worth visiting. Good food, great service!"}
{"text":"Talk about crap.   I took a party of 10 for my girlfriends birthday and 2 of the 10 enjoyed their meal.    Apparently the gnocchi is the only dish worth ordering. I was shocked cause those girls usually love anything and are usually happy eating at a chain in the suburbs.     This was truely a disappointing experience.     That will teach me to wait till the last minute to book a birthday party."}
{"text":"1 star for the taste of the pasta and the location.  Pasta was good but experience was not. Do not order the salad, it was tasteless with very poor presentation. no wonder why it is generally slow. Service was very slow. We live in the neighbourhood and love eating out but will not go back there."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, with nice service and authentic northern Italian cuisine. Wine and food were both great and I cannot wait to be back (again)!"}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious, authentic Italian restaurant. It almost feels out of place in its location, because of how good it is.  Born Italian, raised Italian, been living with my Italian nonna for the better part of 23 years, I know good Italian food when I have it.  I had the Risotto alla Milanese, and it was absolutely delicious. The Ossobuco was tender, flavourful, and the risotto was perfectly cooked.   The location is very cute/quaint, with Italian jazz numbers complimenting the vibe.   Couldn't recommend this place highly enough, give it a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pros: - Love the whitewashed patios, walls and decor. Overall, the restaurant is very stylish, clean and gives off the ambiance of a hip, modern Italian bistro. - The homemade tagliatelle pasta was delicious! The mushrooms were also very flavourful. You can definitely taste the difference between the pasta here compared to other pasta dishes at restaurants that use store bought pasta.  - Accommodating staff. - Food was served really quickly.  - Washroom was clean (which is a definite plus, especially since it was one of those basement washrooms).  Cons: - Menu was a bit pricey. - Bread was very dry and crunchy."}
{"text":"Came here with a reservation for a table for 4, on a Friday night at 7pm. There was still plenty of room them but filled up quickly but the time we left at 9 it was filled. I love the illustrations and their branding on the placemats and menu, and the cute baseball bench seating across the wall.   We started with fritters with DOP cheese, this was quite disappointing barely any cheese and just tasted like fried dough. We also got the polenta toast with porchini and polenta fries, The polenta was soft on the inside and cripsy on the outside, a bit bland but was satisfying. I got the PIZZOCHERI DI TEGLIO, since it was very hyped up on here. The hand cut buck wheat noodles were ok, kinda too chewy and felt a bit gritty, the cabbage was bland but the cheese was good and it was very filling and served in a cute skillet. the TAGLIATELLE AI FUNGHI PORCINI was better, richer and flavourful sauce and good noodles. The RISOTTO ALLA MILANESE CON OSSOBUCO was excellent, the veal shank was tender and the risotto was flavourful (a bit on the salty side) but was savory, the portion was also huge. The food was good but i feel like there are much better places for italian food in the city especially within the same price point.   The service was a bit slow between appetizer and entree, it took them a while to bring it out. The atmosphere is lovely though, really cozy and there seems to be other Italians eating there. the place gets really loud when filled but ,it feels like you are in another country by the end of the night."}
{"text":"Wow, I didn't expect this. I think I've got a little of the Boston-North-End snobbery. This place totally caught me off guard.  Great Northern Italian dishes. The ravioli was incredible. I don't think I've ever had such wonderfully light ravioli dough. The meat-on-a-stick is definitely a \"Gots-To-Have.\" Everything is cooked to order with love, and you can taste it.  The wait staff/host provided some of the best dining experiences I've had (including many high end dining establishments). Just like they food, they served with love.  I rarely feel compelled to dole out a 5 star rating but this place definitely deserves it.  We'll be back next time we spend a weekend in Toronto."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a holiday Monday night for dessert. Place has style, which is cool - and clear the owner is very proud. Which is nice.  Place was relatively empty, so not much competition- but regardless the service was great. She was friendly and really tried to be helpful.  Got the Biscotti al burro con panna at the suggestion of the waitress. So they're called butter cookies, and I'm not sure if there was some confusion w the waitress - but I was under the impression that these would be like wet biscoff cookies. I might have (wishful thinkingly) mentioned biscoff instead of biscotti and she didn't want to correct me. But what I thought I was getting was not at all what I got - but what I got seems like what was supposed to come out. So, it was like 3 butter cookie/short bread like squares w whipped cream. Like butter cookies, not much flavor and little sweetness. I was expecting a less dry biscoff/speculous like cookie. Luckily for me, I asked for Nutella to dip it in. And Nutella is sooo good and basically turned the dessert into Nutella w butter cookie dippers. Which wasn't at all worth the calories, but worked ok. So if you're not a fool like me and know what you're getting, you're going to like it. I like sweet, which this was not. Nor was it cinnamony like biscoff.  Again, service was great and the place was cool, but Im guessing I would've rated it higher if I'd not been an idiot. The other ppl seemed really happy w their food and wine."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here and plan to return. There's nothing particularly special about this place from first glance: it has a clean and simple decor and a decent dining space. Menu is wonderfully traditional with many categories (appetizer, salad, primi, secondi, polenta, risotto,  etc.) but only a few dishes in each, I suppose so that they can concentrate on making each dish delicious. My friend and I shared the homemade mushroom pasta and braised beef/polenta, and they did not disappoint. Followed by Nutella crepes which were also tasty. Portions were generous but not huge, so you don't leave stuffed. Service was a bit slow at first and it felt long for the first dish, but our waitress was helpful and knowledgeable in her recommendations of the food and wine. Ambiance was good and it wasn't too busy (Wednesday night...). Overall an excellent meal; I secretly hope this place doesn't become too popular."}
{"text":"The hotel concierge had recommended a different Italian restaurant, but I didn't love the look of this. Given the Yelp reviews, I thought Stelvio would be a better choice. It was pretty quiet when I arrived, though some more folks came after. It's a cute little place, though the music choices (Elvis-esque music played a little too loudly) were a bit odd to me, and didn't help with the ambiance. In any case, the food is the thing, and so I ended up with a Montagna salad: arugula, fennel, Guanciale, mint and shaved Grana. It was quite tasty, and the lemon and EVOO dressing was nicely acidic without being too much so.  I rarely order pasta as my main because of the carbs, but this seemed like a time to make an exception, and I ordered tagliatelle accompanied by what was described to me as a venison Bolognese. The pasta was cooked nicely, but the problem for me is that it felt like I was eating pasta and ground meat (venison in ground form, at least in this case, was pretty indistinguishable from ground beef) tossed together. Any sauce that had existed hadn't made it onto the plate, and so the dish felt disconnected and lacking for me--I ended up leaving some of it. I was disappointed and wished I'd gotten the rabbit dish I was considering (but I let the waitress talk me out of it).  They also served some bread, along with olives, both of which were tasty (and of course a balsamic/EVOO combo for dipping).  The other negative--other than my main course--was the wine. I wanted a white, and my only two choices were either $19 or $20. Pretty pricey for a neighborhood restaurant. I got one, but I regretted it, as dinner ended up running $75 with tip and tax. They were very nice and gave me a little glass of Amaro before I left, but while on balance I'd say the meal was OK, it just wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"This is a true Italian restaurant. Dishes are well prepared, with Rich sauces. The service was it efficient and friendly. Also, the dining room with a nice casual Urban feeling, set a nice tone."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while shopping on Queen West, we felt like Italian and hey look! Stelvio is right here! What timing.  I loved pretty much everything about this place: the decor, the service, and especially the food. I've eaten at a LOT of Italian restaurants around the GTA and this place really stands above with the dishes on the menu, they are not like the usual offerings you see around here.  We tried the tagliatella with meat sauce, the sausage risotto, and started with the smashed potato appetizer (with onions, green beans, cheese and bacon). Literally every one of these dishes was amazing.   My only complaint is that food took a while to come out, I found the seats very cramped and a bit uncomfortable by the end of our meal, and it was a lot louder in there than expected (though I blame this mainly on the loud couple next to us).  Overall there's no way i'm not going back here for the amazing food and lovely staff (I love the little patio out front too and want to check it out). Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful. It was a treat being served Italian food by Italian gents. The food was simple, light, and delicious. We loved that all the food was made fresh in house."}
{"text":"My friends and I stumbled into Stelvio after noticing the new bright white patio that popped up on Queen street.   Stelvio prides itself in serving Northern Italian food near the Valtellina region. The service was great, our waitress pointed out the well-known dishes from the region and recommended which ones may be heavier/lighter meals. I ordered the tagliatelle with mushrooms, while my friends ordered the buckwheat spaghetti and the taroz (potato puree with beans, butter and cheese). My pasta was very satisfying, but it was heavier and had a little bit too much butter/oil for my liking. My friend felt the same way about her spaghetti and as a result we both could not finish our pastas.  I would try Stelvio again but it may not become one of my staple Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"The ambience is really cozy and the staff are friendly! Ordered the fritters as starters. They were really light and quite tasty (albeit a bit bland). For the main course, I had the mushroom risotto. I had to leave half of it because it was so salty. The dessert really saved the meal for me, hence the 4 stars. I ordered the chocolate cake and it was heavenly! Presentation was great too. All in all, they need to really reduce the salt on the risotto but the rest of the meal was great."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Extraordinary service who know about he menu is detail. The pancetta was not cooked in the salad was not good. We would have preferred it was cooked not cured. Pasta is homemade and delicious. The polenta burger (sausage made in house) was exquisite. Polenta fries were excellent. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Stelvio is an Italian restaurant in Downtown Toronto. It was packed on a Saturday night and we were lucky to have a table. After glancing the menu, we placed our order. Shortly after, our server brought us a plate of Poppyseed Sesame Bread served with EVOO balsamic vinegar dipping sauce and herb marinated olives.  Based on other Yelp review, we ordered the Taroz, which consisted of crushed potatoes with green beans, butter, onion and cheese served on a iron skillet. It was to die for. The only other thing to die for was Zuppa D'Orzo Carciofi E Patate, which was a soup with barley, artichoke, potatoes, and garlic.  We're weren't too impressed with the Dante Salad, Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini, and Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini. The Dante Salad consisted of shredded pan seared chicken breast, Caesar DOP cheese, lettuce, and red chicory lightly tossed in a dijon vinaigrette. I didn't like how either Tagialette had much flavor or sauce. Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with porcini mushrooms. Tagialette Al Ragu Bianco consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with homemade meat sauce and fried herbs including sage and rosemary."}
{"text":"What a nice little spot.  Very friendly service in this authentic Italian restaurant.  We had pastas and two of the risotto dishes.  The osso bucco was great."}
{"text":"Super cute place great food and great service... it's apparently authentic Italian l!"}
{"text":"Service exceeds expectations (thank you Rodrigo!). Food is tasty. Ambiance is great.  Service: I contacted Stelvio to book a birthday party for my girlfriend. They were extremely accommodating and quick to reply through email and phone. They created a customized menu according to our group's tastes and budget, and finally printed out a unique dinner menu with her name on it. They made her feel very special on her birthday. Waiters and waitresses were very patient with our large group, and accommodated a few last minute changes without issue (thank you!).  Food: 5 appetizers (assorted delis, assorted cheeses, meatballs, salad, polenta fries) between 6 people, and a choice between 3 mains (risottos and pastas), plus self-brought cake (no cake plating fee whaaat!) and house coffee/tea for $25. Everything was delicious, and very filling.  At the end of the night, Rodrigo invited my girlfriend and I to try traditional Italian liquors on the house, simply because he wanted us to experience a bit more of his culture (amaro nonno - so delicious!). Felt extremely welcomed and enjoyed our dinner immensely. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"No idea how this place has such high reviews. Service was friendly, that's about it.   The food was extremely slow, took 50 minutes to get our pasta. It wasn't even busy, only two tables inside, and four on the patio, mostly empty.  When the pasta finally did arrive, it was watery and bland. Tasted like microwaved frozen dinner. Most disappointing pasta I've ever had."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our recent first time visit to Stelvio. I'm giving 4 stars because while the food was enjoyable it is overall a bit overpriced, $20 for a plate of polenta and sausage doesn't seem reasonable for such simple ingredients. But the risotto was really good, and the server was nice, though the restaurant was surprisingly empty. Would consider coming back to try some of the other dishes, though I would definitely be back if they adjusted their prices to better fit the menu!"}
{"text":"First time at this place and it's gonna be my last.  Let me warn you it's not the most comfortable restaurant to sit in. Very tight, loud but I guess that goes hand in hand at some places.  The portions are very small but tasty and as for service which was terrible starting from the cold persona hostess to our inconsiderate waitress that hardly came around to check on us. She took my arugula carpaccio plate away and didn't ask if I was done and then I asked for another order of bread and took forever to come between courses. When it finally came she made a point to tell me that it was going to be added to my bill.  Wow! Thanks for the info. Finally I had to go up to her and the hostess and ask them to take our coffee orders. She said I quote \"espresso\" I replied please come to our table and ask each person what they'd like. I felt like I was her manager training her. Trust me she would be fired and working at Denny's."}
{"text":"It was nice experience. Nice cozy place with a very friendly staff. North Italian taste - rather unusual for Toronto.  Every dish was worth every calorie;) Another plus of this place is nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Northern Italian style, went there with 2 friends and overall we enjoyed the food very much!!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Italian food, all the pastas are made from scratch - these guys know what their doing! Very fun environment, with great food, service and drinks. 100% coming back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Simply the best! The best way to taste the real northern Italian kitchen is at Stelvio. Great risotto con ossobuco, fresh pasta and good wine. I always go there when I miss the flavours of home. Beautiful patio and great service!  Grazie Rodrigo!"}
{"text":"The service is super.  The food is good - I have had better pasta but it's still very fresh and yum."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place to eat. The service was phenomenal and the servers are very lovely. (A sense as if you were really in Italy) All of their foods are made in house and to die for. I would definitely recommend going here!!   From left to right in the photos  1. Casoncelli Alla Bergamasca 2.carpaccio di bresaola Della Valentina  3.torta di mele e gelato"}
{"text":"During our very first visit to the city of Toronto, my co-worker and I stumbled across this stylish Italian eatery off of Queen Street West. Stelvio was an exceptional dining experience from start to finish.  From their carpaccio to their fresh handmade tagliatelle, everything we tasted was of excellent flavor, quality, and obvious authenticity. The atmosphere itself is very European - the venue is decidedly small, exhibiting an intimate, yet surprisingly comfortable dining environment. The service was also lovely and swift. Apparently, they have another restaurant in Milan, which is of no surprise - both the menu & execution of dishes would make any true Italian proud.  A few Italian beers and delicious hand-rolled pasta makes for a great evening out in the 416."}
{"text":"Hovering between 3 and 4 stars. The food was delicious to be sure, but the price point was extremely high for the portions we received. I realized the pasta is made in house so that accounts for a lot of it, but it still just felt pretty pricey given we didn't really order that much and got pretty hungry again a few hours later.  My husband ordered the ravioli (8 small ravioli in dish. It was FANTASTIC but a tiny portion) and I had the mushroom tagliatelle (also great but just mushrooms tossed in a light sauce with a bit of parsley). We also split the chocolate cake for dessert and I had a glass of wine and the whole tab came out to around $70. WHAT. The night before we ate at another restaurant with dishes packed with seafood, veggies, meat, and more and we spent the same amount of money for around 8-9 small plates of food. And everything was made from scratch there as well.   The experience was nice, and the food was good but I would probably not return given you can get more for your money in Toronto at other locations and have an equally delicious meal."}
{"text":"Love this place!    Firstly, the staff (not sure if the owners) treated us like we were family members and brought us free polenta fries and desserts to try.    Had an amazing meal with a large group, the osso buco with saffron risotto was unbelievable, I've recommended it to so many people to go for that dish.  Would definitely go again and recommend!"}
{"text":"This place seems pretty small and out of the way from the outside, but the inside is quite nice and pretty. The food is all italian and the menu is a little hard to understand, but our waitress was really helpful and helped us understand/pick. We got the meat platter to share and my friend got the gnocchi and i got the polenta bread. Everything was good and very well presented. There were some things that could have been done better(food) but the service was good so overall a good eat."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly, but this restaurant is nothing but a poor, ill-advised attempt at Italian food. The polenta tastes like greasy cheese and nothing like polenta. There are way too many fried and pork-based items on the menu. Their idea of grated parmesan is a salty powder of what may have been one day actual parmesan cheese. Even the salad was way too greasy. It has nothing to do with simple Italian food made with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Was there last night for dinner and everything was amazing!  I'm not going to try and remember the exact names fur things as I can't even pronounce them but my friends and I shared a few things including the meat skewer, the signature pasta dish, the meat & cheese board and a polenta dish.  Everything was super flavourful and our server was attentive and gave good recommendations.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stelvio is a Northern Italian restaurant that seems to import most of it's products and people from the region.  The waiter was really helpful and passionate about the cuisine, letting us taste coffee and wine, and he guided us to delicious carpaccio, pasta, and wine options.  They serve bread with oil and vinegar, and olives as starters.  Everything was tremendous."}
{"text":"I had a really lovely experience here. Myself and a friend came for a 1 pm lunch on a Saturday. Bright open white space and lots of seating.  I had the special tagliatelle with wild boar ragu and it was sensational. The pasta was so fresh and light and the sauce was flavourful.  The portion was perfect for lunch - what a treat.  The owner (originally from Milan) was so sweet and a pleasure to chat with.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This was a great find. You wouldn't think to find delicious, authentic Italian food at Queen and Spadina. Service here was excellent. We enjoyed not-so-typical but amazing pasta dishes and the meat and cheese platters. Would absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"I was really excited for this place and it didn't disappoint. Tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms was really good, fresh and sumptuous pasta with loads of delicious mushrooms. The antipasti plates had some interesting northern Italian cheeses and I liked the fried meatball appetizer too. One huge bummer was the lack of good non-alcoholic drink options - basically sparkling water and that's it. I get that wine would be the thing to have with delicious Italian food, but I was 9 months pregnant when I visited and would have liked something a bit nicer than just soda water."}
{"text":"Well...  Where do I start.  I'll start with the price category.  60 dollars for two people and one drink is two dollar signs only if both people had a three course dinner, not when one of two people leaves the place semi hungry.  So don't be fooled it's priced as a fancy three dollar signs place.  And as such it falls short on menus, silverware, plates and service, they are not bad, just way short of where they should be.  Also, I am not sure what they are trying to be, cheese and meets or a healthy eating place with buckwheat pasta.  I've never been to northern Italy, it's possible that that food is very authentic, but if that is the case I am sold on southern Italy style of cooking from now on."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Since you most likely tried mainly southern Italian cuisine in the many Italian restaurants you've been to, you might be up to trying a restaurant that specializes in Northern italian cuisine here!! Basically I would recommend all the dishes here because it's a different method of flavouring and cooking style.   We tried the sciatt, a buckwheat fritter that had Valtellina Casera DOP cheese inside the balls! Very unique and very tasty especially when it's served hot, the cheese melts inside.   We also had the tagliatelle with Ragu Bianco. Homemade tagliatelle with homemade meat sauce. Pasta was al Dante just the way I like it and the pasta had just the right amount of sauce. Not too much and not little.   We also ordered from the second section and got the polenta salsiccia e Funghi. The sausages on this polenta tasted so good and I'm a big fan of porcini mushroom too so I liked the bite to this mushroom. The polenta was okay, you really need to eat it with the sausage and the mushroom to add the flavor into each bite of this dish.   The waiter was super friendly and nice. She would walk me through the menu and explain what she would recommend us to eat depending on how hungry and how heavy we want the dishes. She would also be brave enough to say if it was too much and asked us to settle for less food to really enjoy the meal.   I loved the music they played at this restaurant. They played Italian and it really added to the experience. I thought I was in Italy for a second in my time spent at the restaurant.   LAST TIP?  You can opt to share dishes because that's what we did so you don't have to just order pasta. You can opt to try the other dishes in the primi and secondi menu too! The restaurant is mainly open for dinners. Only time to catch them for lunch is Friday and Saturday!"}
{"text":"I discovered this tiny little Italian restaurant through yelp. On a warm summer day, I imagine it would be lovely to people watch on the patio (the restaurant is situated on a very busy section of Queen st).  I tried two dishes - tagliatelle with fresh homemade meat sauce and fried herbs, and the risotto alla milanese with osso buco. I really enjoyed both the dishes- the risotto, in particular, was richly flavourful. The portion size was also very generous, and I packed half of it home for lunch the next day.  Would definitely want to come back in the future and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Bormio Panini (pork sausage, lettuce, fresh tomato and homemade cheese sauce) couldn't taste much cheese but tasted lots of mayo, which I'm not really a fan of. But other than that, it's a solid sandwich.   The polenta fries are also amazing! It came with the sandwich, but I wish they gave more. They're delicious! The olive oil that's served with the complimentary bread is also very good.   Will definitely return and try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Was slightly scared when there was only one other couple in the place at 6:15 PM but my fear was soon put to rest.   Laura was our server and she was fantastic! Fully knew the menu, had a great personality and charming.   The menu is about six pages of black and white copy paper on a clipboard and the names of the foods were surely Italian. Laura made some excellent recommendations though and we weren't disappointed in the slightest.   We started with the Sciatt and Tagliere Misto. Well actually we started with some great bread they get from a local bakery and some olive oil to dip it in. Both of the appetizers were delicious. The prosciutto was really nice and not too salty as many I've had before are.   For the entrées, we ordered the Pizzoccheri Di Teglio. Reading the description I was originally put off slightly because of the mention of cabbage and potatoes mixed with pasta. When it came out it resembled a stroganoff but was very tasty. Don't let the look of it deceive you. Laura said it was one of the dishes that's returned to the kitchen most frequently because it doesn't look like what people expect. Once you get past that though, it really is quite tasty.   We ordered a Zigeuner as well which comes out on a large wooden skewer that looks like a jumbo pencil. I forgot to ask what type of meat it was and although it was a bit salty, it was nice.   We had the Estiva salad as well for some green accompaniment to everything which was nice. Traditional oil and lemon to dress the salad which I'm personally not too crazy about but got past it quickly enough with the other food.   I let Laura twist my arm on dessert and followed her recommendation again with the Torta Di Mele E Gelato which is fancy for apple cake and gelato which was a really nice way to end this fantastic northern Italy cuisine.   Almost forgot to mention the white wine she recommended. Can't remember the name and the online menu doesn't list the wines for me to refer to but was like a Sauvignon Blanc and was a great choice with all of our picks.   Overall if you're looking for a nice Italian restaurant that's outside of the norm, you've definitely got to give Stelvio a try!"}
