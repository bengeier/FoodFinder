{"text":"decent selection of beers on tap. i love this place for lunch! im a person that always orders the same thing at every place i go, but this is one of those places that i cant pick just one! you can really tell that they order quality ingredients, and their chicken wings especially are awesome! i also love their buffalo chicken wrap and their jalapeno appetizer.  service is really great as well, i usually sit at the bar and am served by Gina.  she is great at her job and i don't know how she does it, but she seems to always be in a good mood! one of the managers named Eric has also gone out of his way for me.  I told him one time that i really wish they had honey hot sauce for their wings, and he told me \"next time you come in, we will have it\". its not on the menu, but he made it happen for me!  This place is great for lunch and easy to get to being right off the 101, but even if it wasn't, id still probably go out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"Great bar, great atmosphere, watching the Cubs game enjoying a cold beer and great food. I would recommend it to anyone. Plus the have live music 5 nights a week. Can't go wrong with the Ventura Grill"}
{"text":"Sandra is fantastic behind the bar. Chef Adam came out & went over the menu in detail with me due to all of my food allergies! The specialty meal he created for me was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is fine. Beer is cold. You can bring the doggies and sit on the patio!  The boys love the fries. The cod was a little over done but other than that we were happy."}
{"text":"During Spring Training, my best friend and I went to Ventura Grill looking for a late dinner on a Sunday night. There aren't many places to eat in the area and we thought they serve food until they closed. We got there and found that they had already shut the kitchen down, but we were heading down to Old Town Scottsdale anyway, so we decided to stay and have a couple of beers. The selection is very good here. They had several Arizona beers that were solid and I loved the atmosphere in the place. The service was some of the friendliest I have had anywhere. Our bartender, Tanya, gave us great information on restaurants and bars to visit in Old Town. She gave us perfect directions and made sure we got where we wanted to go. I'd been to Scottsdale the previous two years for Spring Training and had disappointing meals in Old Town and visited bars that were nothing great, so getting information from a lifetime resident was priceless. We ended up having an awesome time.Tanya rocks and so does Ventura Grill! I'll see you guys again next March."}
{"text":"Good place that only needs a couple minor improvements to be great as it matures. I will be back.  I've been twice to Ventura Grill, and both times the food was excellent, with a single caveat. I had the Reuben lunch special and a stout (beer) both times. The Reuben was tasty and the sweet potato fries were awesome.   Pros:  - Fast service (seated, ordered, and eating within ~22 minutes)  - Friendly service (waitresses are very friendly and courteous)  - Good food, the sweet potato fries are awesome  - Prices aren't bad ($8 for lunch menu items)  Cons:  - Both times I've been I ordered a beer, and the server (different servers each time) poured the beer so fast the \"head\" took up half the glass. By the time the head settled, I had literally half a beer. I chalk this up to inexperience, but if it happens a third time, I'll talk to the manager about it (courteously, of course).  - Inattentiveness by wait-staff. Not a huge deal, but my party did have to get up and go specifically request silverware after our food arrived and no silverware was brought out.  Bottom line: Good food, nice atmosphere, friendly wait staff, decent prices, fast service. A good spot that only needs to polish up a couple rough patches to be first-class. I will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is always good for a quick bite to eat and to enjoy a cold beverage. The burgers are good and the fish tacos are good too. Once you get there and start eating you may want to stay a while and watch a game and have another beverage. I will always have this place on my list."}
{"text":"We had a group meeting here which we were greatly disappointed.  I joined our group late and waited more than 20 min for our server to take my drink order.  This was the beginning of the decent into the terrible abyss called Ventura Grill.  After I received my drink, the party was ready to order.  The White board sign outside advertising the specials said \"Steak sandwich $9.99\" .  One of my party said he would have said item for $9.99 and our server said, \"this was the lunch special\".  She marched directly out to the exterior board and erased the noted price and changed it to $10.99. (fine)  We ordered our $11 special and our server said it came with our choice of sides (fries, tots, onion rings, coleslaw, side salad or cesar salad).  Two of us ordered the salads.  Food arrives.... our steak sandies are missing cheese (as advertised w/ provolone).   We commented to our server that we are paying the additional dollar for the sandies, we should get cheese.  Unfazed, she laughed and walked away.  The bill arrived stating that we had to pay full price for the sandies (without cheese),  no discount for the mistake on the white board,  additional charge for the salads (which was noted in the menu, but not by our server), and not even a free beer to make up for wait time, mistakes, or false advertising.  BTW, I ordered my steak Medium Rare and my buddy ordered Rare.  I got rare, he got well done.......  Poor training is the root of this scenario.    PS, Normally, we are a group of 12 or more, tonight we were actually light and only had 6.  Do you think we will come back??? NO"}
{"text":"Great calamari!  Large portion, marinara dipping sauce.  Enjoyed the wine special, and shared a burger.  Tasty!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place as it catered to cigar smokers. They recently stopped allowing smoking inside though so I guess we will have to find a new \"go to\" spot. We will be back for sure if/when they change back."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service most times with blaring TVs.  Just getting someone to acknowledge you takes more than 5 minutes and trying to get the check and takeout container adds another 10 minutes.  And if they try to memorize your order without writing it down, consider yourself lucky if they only forget 1 of your items (for our table of 3, the waitress forget 2 things because she did not need to write down our order).  The food is pretty good, nice patio if you don't mind smelling the smokers and listening to the TVs."}
{"text":"Had a very nice pizza dinner here on a Sunday evening, and a couple of drinks with friends.  Under the new ownership, I was very pleasantly surprised, as nice acoustic music was playing and had a great time.  Food and service was top notch.  I will be back soon. Great specials and good prices"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my French Dip- I paid a dollar more for the Parm/Rosemary fries....so TASTY! Altogether for my meal (which included my adult beverages), I paid under $30."}
{"text":"Previously, this would've been a 4-5 star review, but the last 2 times that we went in, we left without service after 20+ minutes.  The food is good but the bartenders are not mixologists."}
{"text":"We've only eaten there once, but it won't be the last!!  Great food, great service and great atmosphere!!!  Fish tacos were divine, stuffed jalape√±os were to die for.  Can't believe we haven't found this place sooner!  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"They lady bartender was very nice. And beer was cheap. Had good time, will try coming back for wings on wed or sun"}
{"text":"Very happy! The new ownership is doing it right.  Went in tonight during HH and was pleasantly surprised. If you haven't been in a while, GO.  large nachos were very good. New owners were there, very good people.  Expansion going on, with an additional patio going in and a larger dining area with additional bar space. This is my new neighborhood stop."}
{"text":"Bar owners an alcoholic. Been there multiple times to support local bands and had to leave early because he got pretty sloppy. Overpriced food. Staffs hit or miss under the plastered mgmt. Recommend the tavern grill or if you don't want food, the dirty dogg."}
{"text":"Goods - the fried green beans and parmesan/herb fries were great!  Good sauces to accompany them. Not so good - the bbq chicken salad came on a bed of iceberg lettuce.  Yuck!  Anything but iceberg people!!  Disappointed in this salad as a whole. The sausage lavosh was ok... as in not great!~  Covered with way too much sausage that was okay tasting.   This dish could use a little rework to make it better.  The Havarti cheese was hardly noticable because of the over abundance of ok sausage.  Atmosphere is pleasant and people are nice! I will be back to give them another try as I had a good experience the last time I went ordering different dishes."}
{"text":"A group of us from work spent $10 on a Groupon and went for lunch.  The waitress was extremely upset that we had Groupons and CURSED at one of us when she found out we were using them. After she scanned all our vouchers she tells us that we are losing the remaining amounts left on the voucher. If we knew that before hand we all wouldnt have used our vouchers at once.  Overall terrible experience.  She should have educated us about how to make the most of the groupon rather than getting upset and cursing. I've never been so appalled with service in my entire life.   The food was approrpriately priced for lunch and was pretty good. If it wasn't for the terrible service we would be back again."}
{"text":"Cold beer!!  I do not like the open patio with all the smoking but that is a personal preference.  I enjoy the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Just went there for breakfast with my parents. Was excited to have a place so close to home.... but Food took FOREVER to come, My dad ordered the breakfast burrito and was really impressed with the first 2 bites.... the 3rd bite included some GLASS !!!!!!! Yes, my dads burrito had BROKEN GLASS IN IT!! The owner NEVER even came over to apologize, and they only comped HIS meal... not all of ours.... tacky classless and disturbing.   NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER GOING BACK.   The only good thing, is their green tea. But that's not even worth going back for."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night after the gym.  Great location, great friendly staff.  Love the open-air patio with ability to see bar TV's - for now anyways.  Food was really great.  I ordered some chicken breasts and veggies.  Came out from the back just as I asked.    Really pleased with this little 101-side gem."}
{"text":"My buddy & I went here for the last 2 Sundays to watch Da Bears. The Ventura Grill has a terrific patio & a decent beer selection & pretty good food. What it is sorely lacking in is service. I'm talking epically poor service. We sat there for 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. Over 45 minutes for a hot dog & fries? And if you want a refill on your drink, you'd better order it when your current one is only half empty. So what is it? Understaffed? Poor planning? All I know is I gave them 2 chances & they blew it with me."}
{"text":"first time here - it was a Friday night and our server was totally overwhelmed (a fallback from allowing people to seat themselves) - took the other staff a bit long to realize he needed help, but everyone was apologetic and friendly and the food came fast.  the fried green beans were the best part of the meal - but the rest of it was delicious as well. burgers, potato skins, tots - all of it was delicious and cooked exactly as ordered. i had the boneless buffalo chicken which turned out to be pieces of chicken breast they cubed and breaded themselves....a little surprising, but delicious nonetheless and probably a little better for me that way.  we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I found Ventura Grill from Groupon and used the $16 Groupon that allowed us to choose 2 breakfast entrees (up to a $9.29 value each) and 2 drinks (up to a $15 value each, CAN be used for alcohol). My husband and I brought our 2 small children with us and ordered the 2 breakfast entrees, which we planned to share with the kids since they don't eat a lot all at once.   My husband got one of their scrambles and I got the pancakes with the berry topping, which was advertised an additional charge above the pancake cost but still well under the $9.29 maximum per entree. My husband ordered a beer and I ordered a mimosa to go along with our breakfast and we ordered the kids each a chocolate milk.  It did take a while to receive our meals but that doesn't bother me unless its a completely unreasonable amount of time. What bothered me was once we got the bill and showed the waitress the Groupon, she had counted our kids chocolate milks as the \"drinks\" that went along with the meal and did not apply the berry topping charge as part of my \"meal'!   The Groupon advertises $16 for up to $48 and change worth of food and drink...our total discount was $2.22 after the $16 paid for the Groupon was considered! The waitress refused to let us separate the chocolate milks from the drinks so that the drinks with alcohol could appropriately be applied to the Groupon. The waitress knew we had a Groupon to begin with and she said NOTHING about how it would be applied. It is unbelievable to me that a business would even think about cheating customers out of a few dollars!! It makes no sense!   Now they have 4 fewer customers and I would not recommend this place to anyone. What matters most to me in a business is that they are honest and that their primary goal is to provide quality service and product to customers and help them get the most for their money. I am willing to overlook a lot of other things if this is still true of a business.  In the case of Ventura Grill, they are neither honest nor do they have quality service or product and the waitress was DEFINITELY NOT interested in helping us get the most for our money. Terrible service AND I had to force my kids to eat the pancakes, they tasted so bland! Not even the syrup could make up for the lack of flavor.  And I also have to add, this is the first review I have ever written. That is how bad of a taste this restaurant left in my mouth both physically and figuratively speaking."}
{"text":"Got the food. Here is the breakdown:  1. Hummus Appetizer: Pretty good though the Hummus could use more seasoning as it was kinda bland. 2. Spicy Chicken Spring Rolls: Spring rolls were good. However, the sauce they are packaged with is so overpoweringly salty that it overrides the flavor of the spring roll all together. 3. Prime Rib Wrap with Parmesan Fries: Great flavor. However, tortilla gets soggy after a few short minutes. Also would recommend seasoning the prime rib. 4. Warm Spinach Salad: Good. The bacon dressing was quite good. Probably the best thing we had in our order."}
{"text":"We gathered here on Halloween and had really great service at the bar. We also ordered dinner, a fish and chips, basket of wings and a grilled cheese :) those french fries are good!!! Really liked this place and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Got to Ventura Grill through a coupon deal which offered two beers, one appetizer and two entrees for $20.  Great deal, right? RIght!  We were actually given many options on the beer which I did not expect.  Hubby had Guinness and I had a Stella.  Good deal so far. We shared a calamari appetizer which was generous, not oily with a very good spicy marinara sauce.  Really good deal. Two entrees were Fish and Chips and Grilled Chicken breasts with veggies and a choice of potato.  There were two fish filets which were thick and juicy.  Fries were well done as I requested.  The tartar sauce and coleslaw seemed homemade and both were delicious.  Slaw was not mayonnaisy (is that a word?)  Chicken breast was ample and fresh but hubby thought it needed a bit of seasoning (perhaps marinating it would have helped). I tasted it and agreed.  A lemon or lime marinade would have done wonders.  Veggies were ample and not overcooked while the fries were extra well done as he had requested.  There were plenty of hot sauces on the table to choose from.   I must pay my compliments to the female server (sorry, I forgot your name) but she was soooooo attentive to our order and to our needs throughout the meal.  The owner came by to see how everything was during our meal and we gave him positive feedback.  This is the kind of restaurant/bar people should be going to because the owner deserves a chance to make it in this economy and because he gives good food, good service and an excellent value.   Ventura Grill offers  basic american style menu items (some of which no longer exist as indicated by them being scratched off the menu) prepared well in a clean environment.  Nothing gourmet or fancy but with quality and attentive service.   To the fool (a customer) who was giving the waitress a hard time over his mis-use of the coupon, STOP IT.  They are giving you so much for your money why would you argue over paying the tax on your meal??  and I hope you didn't stiff the waitress who should be getting a tip on the total value of your meal.  Just saying...."}
{"text":"Great place to be at especially during spring training baseball games with Salt River  Field just across the street and have free shuttles to/from the restaurant so you don't have to worry about drinking and driving and can actually enjoy the games.  Happy Hour food and booze are great prices too and they are absolute delicious.  Sit at the patio and enjoy Arizona sunsets!"}
{"text":"This place is off the hook if you haven't been here I highly recommend you come the food is outstanding the staff is very friendly and the customer's are great people they have bands 5 day a week from country to rock & roll you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"First, the Yelp map is incorrect. Ventura Grill is on Via de Ventura _between Pima Rd. and the Loop 101_.  3.5 stars, rounded to 4 to encourage you to try this pleasant neighborhood-style place, convenient to McCormick Ranch, Butterfly World, and Talking Stick Resort. Food is good, staff is helpful, my bleu burger wasn't cooked too far past my requested medium-rare, my companion really liked her caesar-spinach wrap, and I enjoyed a Summer Special of Lagunitas for $3. The (baked, not fried) stuffed jalapenos are, as so often noted by others, worth trying, but 5 pepper halves for $8 seems a bit skimpy, as well as awkward for 2 or 3 people to share. Just sayin'. Other prices seemed reasonable and I will happily return, but will probably figure out how to make the jalapenos at home."}
{"text":"Went there for my first time last night.  Great place, atmosphere, and staff with live music.  I had the best seared Ahi tuna salad!! I will be coming back and will recommend this place to my friends and to anyone who wants a good time, good music and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday Night.  Rockin' Bands! Wow! Fantastic! It was crowded but the staff made sure everyone was served all night long. I had the Prime Sliders and sweet potato fries. Awesome. Juicy and delicious! Reasonable prices too.  I didn't know what a little gem this place is."}
{"text":"While off the beaten path per se, this is a chill cool place right off the 101 and Via de Ventura.  There is a nice patio with tables and a long bar on the inside with tables.  I've been many times and talked with the Manager Jay, a really nice guy.  If you go, tell em \"Croft\" sent ya.  You may get a free drink!   I haven't tried the food so I can't speak to it but they do have a good beer drink special, $2 pints $3 22 oz Bud Lights all summer long.    The outdoor area is open to the bar as well and you can belly up there as well and watch many of the flat screens they got going.   This is a great spot to catch football games without the crazy loudness you'd usually here at Zipps.    If you are a smoker, next door they have an entire bar smokers room.  They sell cigars, not sure about cigarettes."}
{"text":"I love this bar and grill.  The food is excellent and they have great lunch specials.  Their fish tacos are some of the best I have ever had.  I really enjoy the food and the service."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised that the average rating is 3.5 stars.  This place is mediocre at best (as a restaurant anyway).  Fairly small generic \"sports bar\".  It's not really that sportsy, but it does have a few TV's.    Berry Salad - Very good to excellent Wings - Very good to excellent Fish & Chips - meh Burger - underdone and served with cold onion rings and cold Steak - WAY underdone had to be sent back Pasta/Fish - Good  Service was friendly.  Desert cookie very good.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Not the greatest happy Hour on the planet. One of those $1 off places - woo hoo. They did have a beer of the month for $3, but that was sold out. Still have half the month left, so either use an eraser to get it off the chalkboard or find a substitute. Still, a decent amount of beer choices and the cute bartender was changing the TV stations to whatever game I wanted - my own personal living room as no sports fans were present on this day. The fried ravioli should have been priced at $3.99 for happy hour because it amounted to paying $1 reach for slightly above average ravioli (not homemade). The marinara was nice and spicy and parmesan was provided upon request. I will go back and try some food. Looks like a decent neighborhood hangout with strange teams (Bears and LSU)."}
{"text":"Love this place! A lovely Sunday afternoon stop. The beers are cold,  the food is hot and the service is great.   We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Im not sure what happened to the cook but the food had no flavor at all compared to several months back when the food there was awesome! IDK what happened????"}
{"text":"Closed. According to the notice on the door, they haven't been paying rent. :-("}
{"text":"Didn't know where to eat so decided to try Ventura grill. As we sit down we are greeted with Sandra. A passive aggressive older bartender. Sandra acted like we needed to provide a service for her. As I tried to modify the boneless buffalo wings (which are okay) she replied with \"your gonna be that person this early on a Sunday\". The whole time she was bitching and complaining. The staff seemed scared of her. As another customer asked to change the channel On the TV (which it is a Sports bar most people go to watch football) she was plain out rude. I will never go back. Sandra needs to work from home. I didn't tip her cause she didn't deserve. YES I'm the guy with a black nike shirt on. You'll never see me again and Ventura grill will never get my money. Good riddins!"}
{"text":"New owners have really given this place a facelift! The veggie lavosh was recommended and did not disappoint. Looks like a great place to watch sports. Coming back without question."}
{"text":"With a little help, this place could be very good.  The Pasta was cooked perfectly although the sauce could have used more seasonings.    The stuffed Jalapenos were great.  The fish tacos is where it fell apart.  Everything on the plate was good except the fish.  They used frozen fish that was rubbery and tasteless.  The seasoning and breading was very good, but wasted talent on frozen fish that should have been thrown away a long time ago.  This and other restaurants really should learn that fresh fish is really easy to get, probably cheaper than frozen fish and makes their customers happy.  Nothing says I don't care about my customers like frozen proteins.  Get it together and we'll be back.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"This place is  hit or miss. And today they missed... The last 2 times I've been in here  they had to 86 a couple of items.  Today they were out of fries... they have amazing parmesan fries... how can a burger place be out of fries?!?! And l guess they only have  1 waitress today? The service is really slow, but this poor lady is running around like crazy. I feel bad for her.  Plus this is a sports bar, where is the 20 something hot chix l can stare at inappropriately?!!? 2 stars today, 3 on a good day."}
{"text":"I must have been here on an off day.  But the only thing I want to even review is their jalapeno poppers!  Honestly, we went here because of all the reviews that talked about them here on Yelp...and there's a reason for that.  They are freakin' delicious!    The food wasn't worth another visit to me though.  There was a medium sized group of us here and none of us had much to say about our entrees.  But we couldn't stop talking about those jalapeno poppers...seriously!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour on Wednesday with a my work pals. The service was attentive and friendly and the 2.50 beers I will come back for often. The food was bleh.... They ran out of 50 cent wings on wing night and they weren't that impressive. Had to order the boneless wings instead.... Which had the appearance of beef jerky with buffalo sauce. Kinda ruined my well known love of wings."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Ventura grill. The food is consistently good. Great food menu. Friendly service  and Well priced. I enjoy trying different entrees on the menu. Never disappointed. The restaurant  is close to fwy easy on and easy off fwy access.  . Close to talking stick casino and butterfly place located  off 101 fwy. Great meeting place  For friends/family/business  lunches or sunday football .Bar is long and comfortable . Good bar menu. Smoking bar works great for people that smoke."}
{"text":"I came to this place with some buddies to watch the NCAA tournament. The food was not what I would call memorable, but I only tried a bite of my girlfriends dish. I only had beer.   On the plus side, we had about 7 people with us and asked if we could have some free appetizers because we would be drinking there all afternoon. The waitress asked the manager and they compromised with happy hour prices the whole time we were there, even though they don't offer happy hour on Saturdays.   In the end we had a great time here and this bar is more than sufficient to host a get together with friends to watch sports. Again, I only tried one thing, the food could be amazing I just can't comment on it, for venue and good management... they get four."}
{"text":"Went there with a Groupon and was pleasantly surprised.  Food was really good. Service was good.  We had the Pork roast sliders and fish tacos -- very yummy. I could smell the smoke coming from the lounge but my husband couldn't.  This place is one of the better bar and grill type of places in Scottsdale because of the food."}
{"text":"Sports bar / grill pub, located right off the 101 and close proximity  to the Butterfly wonderland which is the reason we visited the Ventura Grill. The place was fairly busy the had a group of 12 walk in just before us. The only person working tables as also the bar tender, she did a great job and got our drinks out fast and order and food out quickly as well. The burgers are good and the fries you can get different varieties sweet pot, rose merry/parm, regular. The salsa is a little spicy on the chips and sals app. Lots of different choices on the menu. She said they are creating a mild. They have great beer specials and tv's to watch the game."}
{"text":"Being from Ventura CA, I just had to try this place! I was impressed with the atmosphere in the bar area, with several TVs, clean bar and tables, and plenty of windows. I'm not a smoker but this is a place to go if you like to smoke, with a large indoor and outdoor patio with misters. Dave the bartender, pretty much handled the entire place on his own, making sure everyone was taken care of.  Good selection of beer and impressive menu. I had the jambalaya and my girlfriend had club wrap and both were very good.  I just found my next favorite place to go!!"}
{"text":"Service was ok but food was nasty. It all tasted the same. Very bland and left bad taste In my mouth. The taste is so bad it's making me nauseous. I won't be going back there for food, maybe drinks though. Can't mess beer up!"}
{"text":"2nd time here. Both for Kiltlifter and beef sliders. Satisfying each time.   Relaxing, casual patio."}
{"text":"Manager Sandra has zero customer service and spends more time telling people how fabulous she is than serving.  She is greedy beyond belief refusing to staff any wait staff besides herself for a party of  20+.  Jay the bartender is the only redeeming factor here.  But no worries for unsuspecting customers.  Doors should be closed permanently by 2015."}
{"text":"Our hotel recommended the Ventura Grill and I'm glad they did.  The staff was quick and friendly.  The food was good, and the menu has some interesting choices on it.  I can tell this is a favorite watering hole for the locals.  I ordered some sort of a flat bread melt thing and must say it was really good.  Excellent selection of draft beers.  The ONLY thing I did not like was that next door was a smoking bar and the smoke would leak into the restaurant which I found really irritating.  I would visit again."}
{"text":"The food is good, but more often than not, the wait staff is overwhelmed and orders get messed up and things take too long."}
{"text":"A party of five of us sat down on the patio and waited for over ten minutes and were never even acknowledged by a waitress.    However, a waitress came outside twice to assist the table next to us, but never even greeted us.  Can't say we'll ever come back."}
{"text":"Wow, very slow for a Tuesday night. Went for happy hour with a coworker,  missed it by 10 minutes.  We did however stay for their Taco Tuesday.  Food was much better than expected.  Had chicken tacos,  meat was very flavorful. For sure would order them again.  Will have to come back in time for happy hour next time."}
{"text":"Love this place as a neighborhood bar/restaurant. Food is pretty darn good and service is attentive. They have a pretty good draft beer selection, and change it up fairly often too. Nice happy hour selection as well. Amanda is a great bartender!"}
{"text":"If I could give 5 stars for just the jalape√±o poppers...I totally would.  I wasn't impressed.  At all.  I ordered a burger and shared a prime rib wrap (say that 5 times fast).  My burger was overdone and the wrap was uber soggy.    I was really looking forward to trying the food here after reading the reviews.  It could have just been an off night, and I will definitely give it another chance!  However...these jalape√±o poppers are LEGIT!"}
{"text":"Seriously fantastic patio!!! Excellent customer service, good food and great happy hour! Live music Wednesday - Saturday... Great place to grab a drink and hang out!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Everything I have had here is excellent. Sports bar atmosphere, outside patio, great burgers, tater tots, salads. Eat here on a regular basis. They took my favorite burger off their new menu but made the patty melt for me. It is a great patty melt. Good servers. Will have to try breakfast, heard it is good too. Convenient location, right off the 101 and Via Ventura, next to the Chevron station. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Ventura Grill. Went there at lunch and was surprised to see only one waitress, who was also the bartender. Place was not crowded but there were too many patrons for one waitress spread out over the premises. The waitress/bartender got me the beer I ordered quite quickly but then she had to take several orders throughout the restaurant that I did not see her again for awhile. Have no idea if the food is any good because I left after finishing my beer. Can't blame the waitress as she was doing her best but management is suspect that they couldn't help her out."}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch, the food is good. Today I went and the dining area was full and had 1 waitress and 1 bartender. The manager was talking to a table with 2 ladies, leaving the other customers with slow service from the stressed out waitress."}
{"text":"They deliver!!! That's all I needed to hear. Those magical words are sure enough to hook me everytime, much in the way of *insert inappropriate analogy/similie/metaphor/antithesis here*  Today I ordered a bbq bacon cheeseburger...it was delicious. And too big. That was a \"Dinner\" burger, not a \"Lunch\" burger, but it didn't stop me from trying. Paired with their crispity, crunchety tater tots and an ice cold root beer...(can you say \"paired\" if you are talking about 3 items?)  Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.   So I called in, spoke to the order chick and asked for the burger, tots and a large root beer. No problemo. When she (or some other \"her\") delivered the booty, she was carrying TWO drinks...because they ran out of large cups. NOW THAT'S SERVICE! Other less customer-friendly spots would've just brought the smaller drink and said \"deal with it\" but not my new Ventura Grill friends...they know that a BIG burger requires a BIG beverage. Bless their hearts and bless my bloated belly, they have just been inducted into our lunch-rotation party."}
{"text":"Came here to sit in the evening sun and enjoy my dinner. Was here 5 minutes and they dropped the blinds and took the sun away. I mentioned it and they said they were closing them all for the people inside. Yet, more than just me sat out there for thr sun (only 72 right now) and people were getting sweaters out of their cars. We left. Went elsewhere to sit in the sun and eat dinner.  Second time here....still not impressed. Maybe if the bartender would have been nicer......."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to report this business has closed as Ventura Grill.  New owners have purchased the business and have revamped. No longer a biker establishment.  Much more of a sports bar. Philadelphia Eagles are greatly welcomed!"}
{"text":"Great food - the prime rib sliders were simply amazing. Great fries, awesome salads, and the prime rib wrap was delicious too. The house Margarita was excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a yuppie biker and wanna be biker bar. Sat for 10 minutes upon arrival waiting to be greeted. Cannot understand why they ordered a pizza from Gus's for their customers when they have a full kitchen. Poor service, typical Scottsdale attitudes (fake and boring), definitely not a biker bar."}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon, we discovered this place.  Located off the 101 and Via De Ventura, it's in a small, nondescript shopping center.  There's no way we would have found it otherwise.  Over our many visits here, we tried the following menu items:  Rueben, $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ventura-grill-scottsdale-2?select=gB6SLDq93r5r61__0gnpog#gB6SLDq93r5r61__0gnpog  Prime Rib Sliders, $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ventura-grill-scottsdale-2?select=6RxzFKSwGDwOG3rJqrxw6A#6RxzFKSwGDwOG3rJqrxw6A  Pulled Pork Quesadilla, $10.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ventura-grill-scottsdale-2?select=QoiqZ3ZPALPeo2kXlVaS6Q#QoiqZ3ZPALPeo2kXlVaS6Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ventura-grill-scottsdale-2?select=qYlPtafA8ZGrNYEzvHGp5w#qYlPtafA8ZGrNYEzvHGp5w  Hickory Smoked Wings, $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ventura-grill-scottsdale-2?select=QbEkzobwZfnF2w7_pZL-6g#QbEkzobwZfnF2w7_pZL-6g  Chicken Wings, $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ventura-grill-scottsdale-2?select=iiPyNCth7Ca1YzhmW-KyXA#iiPyNCth7Ca1YzhmW-KyXA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ventura-grill-scottsdale-2?select=zTqm3ySm5AYnJx3nGt4mZQ#zTqm3ySm5AYnJx3nGt4mZQ  Stuffed Jalapenos, $8 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ventura-grill-scottsdale-2?select=VL3V1ec3XMvhM83Lt865oQ#VL3V1ec3XMvhM83Lt865oQ  Cheeseburger, $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ventura-grill-scottsdale-2?select=2kJ6DxZ83QVSR5csoASbMw#2kJ6DxZ83QVSR5csoASbMw  Turkey Burger, $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ventura-grill-scottsdale-2?select=1CPYxSK5iu7acl5uTKUX8A#1CPYxSK5iu7acl5uTKUX8A  The food is pretty good here.  My favorite items are the Pulled Pork Quesadilla, Hickory Smoked Wings, and Rueben.    The Pulled Pork Quesadilla surprised me...I've never had one before that I liked, but theirs is fantastic.  It's also very filling.  I don't recommend getting it as an appetizer unless you have 3 or 4 people.  If you eat two pieces of it, you'll be full.  The Hickory Smoked Wings are very good...and addicting.  They have a sharp, smoky flavor and the Meat is moist and holds the flavor well.  I highly recommend trying these.  The Rueben is pure heaven.  They use Marbled Rye here, which is my favorite.  Overall, this place does a good job.  They have friendly servers and there's plenty of big screen TV's all over the place, so it's awesome to watch a game.  Return Factor - 91%"}
{"text":"Stopped here with a friend for a quick snack because it was convenient. Comfortable and clean facility. Sole server at lunch was poor planning. Took us a while to get our stuffed jalape√±os, and they weren't worth the wait. I'm  willing to give them another chance and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Chicken ceasar salad--chicken was charred black and overcooked.  Burger was just ok.  The band was terrible and the service was extremely slow.  Save your money and your time.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Slow on a Wednesday lunch so we had our server's full attention. She did a great job making the lunch special sound appetizing. I got the California club wrap with the Parmesan fries and the hubs got sliders and sweet potato fries. Mine was dry, if there was any dressing, I couldn't find it. His was opposite, very greasy. Portions were good, enough left over for one person to have for dinner, but the quality was not quite worth the price. Wanted to see their happy hour specials- not impressed. And lastly, asked for our check and a to go box and refill. Tip of the trade: bring that drink in a to-go cup if they've already asked for the check. Apparently our server didn't know that one."}
{"text":"This place is really cool and great for Sunday football!!! The food though is not that good....actually really bad. Drinks and beer are the same at every bar and this place even had different beers I've never seen, but people who go out to eat avoid this place."}
{"text":"Very nice inside service was OK. I got the Baked Cod,  The vegetables were good and the salad was good as well.   However when I took a bite of the fish.... well the first thing I tasted was the large amount of lemon and then it hit me.  THE DAMN FISH WAS SPOILED.  I informed the bartender that was helping me and she took it back to the kitchen, when she returned she asked if I would like something else?  I said no thank you and asked for the check.  While I was waiting for the check the Manager came out and mentioned that he\" took a bite of my fish and it did not seem that bad\"  I told him to enjoy but I was going to pass.  Third bad experience at this location.  Pretty sure I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Jalape√±o poppers are the best!! Their food selection is outstanding and all the burgers are top notch. I love their patio area (minus the smoking, the only con of the whole place and I assume it is allowed since they're on the Indian reservation) and my wife has a hankering for their bloody mary's. Definitely becoming a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Way over priced. During happy hour their well drinks are  $9!!    Nothing happy about a $9 drink Explains why the place is empty Less than 3 miles down the road at The Tavern Grill they offer top shelf drinks for $3.50 plus the food is something that you want to eat. Won't be returning to ventura"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Sunday 12:00 ......1 person to waitress, bar tend and bus tables! Not only did she have to wear 3 hats she had to mop up a mess on the floor.  Food is ok but nothing to make me go back.   Not complaining about the waitress she was fine."}
{"text":"I came here for trivia with some friends and I was waiting solo for a bit. The service was great throughout the night and our server kept a good eye on the group. I got some drinks in during happy hour and waited for the rest of my party before ordering. I was starving, so I had an order of fried pickles, the California chicken sandwich, and a side Caesar salad. The salad came out before my app which was weird but forgiveable. It was what I would expect from a Caesar salad, nothing more and nothing less.  The rest of the food came out and my dishes looked underwhelming. The fried pickles were ok. Not too battered, there was something a little off about them but I can't put my finger on it. The sandwich looked super sad. The bread was crispy as though it at one point been toasted but was very soft, and the ingredients sort of just meshed together and were indiscernible. Everyone else enjoyed their food so I think maybe I got too crazy with what I ordered. I really liked the environment and we'll likely return for trivia, maybe I will try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Didn't expect this place to be any good but my wife & I have gotten food here several times and love the salads"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, they had awesome live music. Very cool historic Phoenix band called Crystal Haze. They rocked!  I had the French Dip, my girlfriend had the fish and chips. Both were great.  Very friendly staff, the place was well polished. I heard they just opened a couple months ago, so they are doing very well and could become a Scottsdale hotspot.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Very nice, and big portions like their web site says.  Tried the Calamari, tender, and the breading was nice and lite.   Huge portion that 3 people could nibble on with their meal.  The Seafood Fettuccini was Great.  Lottttts of seafood in the dish, and the pasta was a thinner noodle.  Most will do to thick of a noodle and then it seems too starchy.  But this was nice flavor and filling. I'm Italian and picky because I make my own sauce at home.  What I had was better than some Italian Restaurants."}
{"text":"We went to the place and loved it! Food was great menu and service was great. Went back a second time and it stated going downhill from there. Ultimately the final straw was I got a burger and the cheese was straight from Walmart! Wonderful Kraft cheese. It was horrible. We have not gone back since. We use to love this place now we aren't going back. Steer clear!!!"}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon since this place isn't far from my house. I brought my husband and my 2 year old in for a nice meal. It was a great experience because they catered to my 2 year old with kiddie cups, crayons and coloring books. Not to mention the staff was very sweet to my little boy which is typically unexpected in a sports bar/grill atmosphere. My husband had the prime rib wrap which he thought was amazing! I had the Spaghetti Amatriciana of which I have nothing bad to say about it. It was more food than I could eat! The best part was that they had a kid's menu. He had chicken strips and fries and ate all of it! Needless to say we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We've been a few times for lunch, and while its convent and has good food the service leaves something to desire.   Today, we walked in and stood waiting for direction to a table. After a couple minutes of no acknowledgement we picked a table. We waited another two minutes and after no acknowledgement again we talked about moving to the bar.   There were other tables who were being served. As we moved to the bat, another party arrived, was acknowledged and sat with menus.   After this, we decided to leave. The lunch service leaves a lot to be desired. This was the last time we will try again for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and great staff. Absolutely love this place. The sweet potato fries are bomb!"}
{"text":"I was here last friday night with a friend, the food was very good (love the stuffed jalapenos and fish tacos!) and the music was excellent! We'll surely come back."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner with my husband and few friends, Ordered prime rib she took forever.  Then food comes out cold she made us feel like we don't belong there, Sandra (so called manager) waited on us, This woman has no manners and is so rude, I am so confused how she has even has a job, Her job should should be never leave her house , What a shame love place hated service ;((  My husband and i would consider coming back if she is no longer there."}
{"text":"Outstanding Food. Rib Basket awesome. Prime Rib Wrap great.  Good Beers on Tap. Great Value.  Too many TV's a distraction, but Food and Value make it a must!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Living Social..we went here and brought a bunch of friends.  Nice outdoor patio that was shaded and misted.. felt so cool.   Great Location. very easy to find.  Burgers were excellent.. I had a spanish , south of the border burger.. huge, avocado, great flavor..cooked Exactly the way I ordered it.   Try the margaritas.. very yummy..  The Jalapeno appetizer was yummy.. the Calamari appetizer was generously portioned and tasty.    My wife had the fish which she really liked.  Lots of menu choices ranging from chicken to burgers and on..  The Rueben looked good..THe sliders were awesome... A great spot to meet for casual dining and good times.   It is very close to the baseball fields as well.   Great spot before or after a Game.   big TV's in the bar area to catch the game."}
{"text":"Recommend: Sweet Potato Fries!  Great patio with misters, large open windows at the bar, and a great TV set up.   Our server Athena was excellent. She was on top of things, but gave us our space.  I picked Ventura Grill for a dinner outing because there was a large variety of food. I LOVED the spicy spring rolls, and the Sweet Potato Fries were the best I ever had! But, Ventura Grill loses a star on my review because both of the guys I was with complained that the meat was not flavored or seasoned.  On top of all the great food and service, they have raffles on Monday Nights for football games....we won! :) Definitely a cool place for dinner or drinks."}
{"text":"Prime. Rib. Sliders. !! Most importantly they're friendly here.  I don't come to Scottsdale often but I'm keeping this place on my list from now on."}
