{"text":"Had dinner here with a group of 9 on a Saturday night. Staff very friendly and accommodating. We waited maybe 10 minutes for our table. Everyone had a variety of the items that were on the menu. Pizza was amazing, salads delicious, calamari were crispy and hot, pasta that I had, Rigatoni with meat sauce was outstanding. Prices are excellent and atmosphere very casual. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Arrived at 630 pm on Friday and I knew it would be busy but didn't mind waiting for a table. The waitress told me we could share the table of six with another family and so my friend,her baby and I ended up sharing it with a family of three which was totally fine. The family of 3 left and we continued to finish up our dinner until the waitress came by and in a passive aggressive tone told us we have to finish up as it's a table for six and there are people waiting. She said that she had reminded me it's a table of six but never said anything about a time limit. Logically we thought another family of 3 would fill up the remaining spots. We didn't think we would be kicked out. She ended our nice dinner in a not so nice way and we won't be going back. Food is good but if they were kinder about the situation I would have rated this restaurant higher."}
{"text":"Update: Have been here many times before, but not in a couple months.  Went for lunch last week.  No liquor licence now, which was very disappointing.  There was no indication of when they thought this would return.  Apparently a change in owners is the issue.  Food seemed very similar.  They changed up the table configurations, removed the large table and added smaller tables.  Added much needed cushions to uncomfortable chairs.  On each table was a sign saying that it was a casual eating establishment and basically do not spend too much time there.  This rubbed my husband and I the wrong way.  I find it hard to believe people who the sign is aimed at would actually change their habits based on a sign.  It simply offends everyone else in the meantime."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant so there could be a wait.  We arrived 20mins after opening on Sunday so we had no problem getting seated. By the time we left 1hour later, it had people waiting.  Their menu is small but sufficient.  We had 2 pizzas, both were very tasty.  They were thin crust and was very flavourful. The prices are reasonable.  Even though we didn't have appetizers or pasta, they looked great on others tables. Will have to try next time.  Service was good and friendly.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I went for dinner with my son.  Food was nothing spectacular.  Wasn't worth what we paid.  Not impressed.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious Napoli style. Family friendly, and very attentive staff. We have tried most of the pizzas, and they are all great."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and it was been consistently delicious! it's a smaller restaurant but they make it work and the staff is great and efficient! I always order the caprese salad and the margarita pizza and they are SO GOOD! Also ordered the blueberry cheesecake this time and it was delicious! Definitely recommend this place & I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Firstly, the place looks fantastic.  I like it because it not pretentious. It's a pizza and pasta place.  Perfect place to take the family or a casual date.  Had the salami pizza and it was delicious.  Thin crust and tomato sauce was perfect.  Loved watching the pizza being cooked in the wood pizza oven.    Service was attentive and friendly.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Ciabatta Tuscana was spectacular. Penne vodka and veal were also good. Nice, homey place. Pizza looked good too but didn't try. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Love this Italian inspired restaurant. The food is excellent. Just too famished to take pics. I'm sure there's plenty out there. Service was fast. Pizza - can't go wrong. Personal sized and full of flavour. I ordered the Prosciutto with the rigatoni  as a splitter for two. Excellent service. Only one suggestion. Don't have a salumi (cold cut) plate without having some slices Italian bread in a basket. This should be a defacto standard in any Italian eatery.  Otherwise. It was thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"Vivo is the best pizza restaurant I have tried in York Region. There are other great pizza spots downtown (Toronto), but Vivo is comparable to them and much closer to home. I have been there twice and the food quality was consistent both times. The restaurant is small, minimal tables = 30 min + wait time during the dinner rush, no reservations accepted & slow-ish service.  Otherwise, nothing major to complain about.   Favourite Pizza's at Vivo: 1) Margherita 2) Prosciutto & Arugula 3) Potato 4) Primavera"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed every bit of my pleasant dinner at @vivopizzapasta.  I ask for nothing more. . Penne Vodka - Pasta dish was thick, flavourful and very creamy, drizzled right amount of  hot sauce to add a kick (spiciness) . . Spaghetti Aglio E Olio - Simple yet flavourful pasta dish with peppery and slight fruity taste from peperoncino flakes and crusty bread crumbs made this perfect. *Highly Recommend* . . Patata Pizza - this pizza had superb melting characteristics.  Fior di latte cheese was melted and gave a texture of smooth and soft.  It tasted extremely fresh and little tangy in flavor. *Highly Recommend* . . Prosciutto Pizza - featured soft and bubbly Fior di latte cheese and salty Prosciutto ham.  The combination was sweet and salty with the added tomato sauce.  The taste was amazing. .. Thanks @vivopizzapasta for the excellent service and absolute delish. meal.  I will definitely come back again. ."}
{"text":"the last week I went there Thurs. evening with my wife & 2 kids about 6:50 pm . All the tables were filled except the one with 6 chairs so we sat down. A female employee approached us & informed us we were not allowed to sit there it was reserved for parties of 6 or more . I asked if it was reserved for this evening and she replied it was not but it was there in case big parties showed up. She pointed to a communal table in the centre which was bigger than the table we had sat at & informed us we can sit there. It was a high table & the two kids did not like the height. My wife decided we should leave . We left but not before I went back in & asked to speak to the owner & was informed by the female she was the franchise owner& was just following orders . I told her she should never have treated her customers that way & that it was not professional. I was given the name of Pino & number & will contact him shortly regarding  this issue. The service was crappie just from when I walked in . I frequent restaurants in the area every week with the family & this is one I will never recommend. If I could give 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"Great food. Small space, but they make it work.   First time trying Vivo, although we have driven by it many times.   We started with the Vivo arugula salad with goat cheese, beets, pine nuts and a honey balsamic dressing. It was very fresh and delicious.   The charcuterie board was nice, but I wish it included some cheese.   My husband devoured his prosciutto pizza and loved it. My Penne Vodka was quite good- it didn't come out hot enough though. Dessert: we split the blueberry cheesecake and the Tartuffo, as they sadly ran out of tiramisu. The cheesecake was good. The Tartuffo was fine, nothing wrong with it, just not what we felt like.   Overall, a good experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"First, the food....  There is nothing wrong with the food. In fact, it's quite tasty and very typical Italian. The regular menu items at $15 is a decent price for this type of food in this type of casual setting.   However if you choose one of their daily specials , suddenly a pizza or pasta goes up to $23! I had their daily specials pizza- a mortadella and pistachio pizza. The crust is done very well with all quality ingredients. But I feel a pizza at $23 is a bit over priced. There were 4 pieces of mortadella and 15 pieces of pistachios.   The veal Parm with pasta, also daily special at $23, was good. Again, nothing wrong but nothing outstanding either.   Second, the service...  There's something off about the service. Again, nothing too wrong, but I find they are a bit not genuine. Almost like they are trying too hard to be nice. On one occasion, we asked the waitress to tell us about the veal parm special. She said \" yeah what about it?\" That was a bit rude. We just missed her description when she explained it the first time.   Anyway, stick with the $15 menu items and even if the service is bad, it's just $15 you forked out."}
{"text":"Service sucks, bunch of Young people running the floor and dont know nothing about customer service. Food is normal nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Drove by this place a few times and having no plans for dinner decided to give it a try. The place is nice and offers a unique menu featuring pizzas, pastas, and mains. You basically pay the same price for any pizza, pasta, and main within it's category which i found to be a great deal. We decided to go with sharing the La Romano pizza and ordered two mains. My partner in crime ordered the mushroom chicken breast and I settled for the veal chop.  We were surprised to hear they didn't have a liquor license!!!!??  The pizza come out first after we specified that we wanted it as an app to share. While it was made in a wood fired oven, the taste was okay, not great but okay. Toppings were anchovies, black olives, and fior de latte. Hot oil was added to give it some flavour.  Soon after the mains came, my veal chop was made med. rare and not the medium i had asked for. The cut of meat was a bit too fatty for my liking and leads me to believe it was an inferior cut. The side of broccoli had too much butter (why add it?) and the roast potatoes probably were made well in advance, I couldn't eat them.  The roast chicken wasn't bad but luckily the mushroom sauce was asked to be put on the side, it was pretty bad. Again a side of broccoli and potatoes that were left unfinished.  While we ate, the inexperience in the service was evident as no one cleared our app plates nor did anyone come and ask how our food was. We left without dessert and not even a \"thank-you and see you soon\" from any of the staff! Won't be running back here anytime soon given the many better Italian options in the area!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good (salad was great, our mushroom pizza was alright, didnt taste cooked enough). Was not very busy in there however it took forever to get service. No one checked in on us. To be fair there was only 1 waitress. Otherwise, the place has a nice bright ambience, very clean and airy."}
{"text":"Went last night- as soon as you opened the doors there was a sign that said \"no beer, no wine\", \"no chicken, no veal\", \"cash only, terminal down\", didn't matter as we were there for pizza. Ordered our pizza only to find out that they also ran out of gluten free crust. Okay, ordered pasta that was gluten free. When the pasta came they gave me the spicy sauce which was too violent for my taste buds so I sent it back. As there is an open concept kitchen, I saw the chef reusing the ingredients in my sauce as they didn't have anymore sausages. I'm thinking that this place is in receivership as they had very limited ingredients on hand, it all makes sense. I am going to be reporting this place to York Region as I saw way too many instances of cross contamination tonight. Stay away!!"}
{"text":"We had been eyeing this place and finally decided to try it last night. We ordered a Margherita pizza for $14 and were told it would take 10-15 minutes. It was ready and on time when we showed to pick it up. Our pizza was cold and ZERO basil on it. This was a disappointment! As mentioned by other customers, the pizza is small and were okay with it but it really lacked any luster. Good wood burning taste and thin crust, (which I love), but the absence of the basil was SO disappointing. Definitely will not go back and will continue to head over to Abruzzo Pizza because they have not disappointed so far."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat pasta and pizza. This place is like levetto - food comes fast and prices are slightly cheaper than larger Italian dine ins. The service is so much better though. Was greeted and seated and was told about the specials. Server was very kind and offered assistance with the menu. Ordered their four kinds of taste pizza, so it had two white (one having potato toppings and the other sausage and rapini toppings) and two red  (Margareta and tomato and Oregano). The pizza was so yummy and definitely fun to eat with all the different flavours. We also ordered the rigatoni bolognese and it was given in a decent portion. Every bite of rigatoni came with a good mouthful of bolognese. The only drawbacks was that wine was served in a water cup and that when it suddenly got cold, they offered to turn up the temperature, but then it got really. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"5 stars are not nearly enough, it should get 10 stars minimum. Ask for Angela as your server- she is friendly and attentive as well as knowledgeable. The food is outstanding. Had the Caprese salad as an app- tomatoes o so fresh,firm but juicy. The Fior de latte chesse so fresh accompanied with a light arugala salad drizzled with balsamic vinegar. For entrees: I had the pollo - juice grilled chicken breast with butter poached broccoli and roasted yukons. She had the Fettuccine Alfredo - it was spectacular. Ok I know what your saying its Alfredo. But it was amazing. She was thinking about ordering a second bowl just because it was that good. Did not have dessert but saw others in the restaurant enjoying them. Next time for sure."}
{"text":"Had some take out from here last night. Pizza, pasta and salad were all fresh and delicious. Thin crust, wood oven pizza with prosciutto artichoke and black olives. Spicy penne with sausage and leaks. Caesar salad.  Would recommend them all! Portions were on the smaller end but certainly did not take away from enjoying the food."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. Food is delicious and simple. They try to keep it authentic. Only problem is that it's always under staffed. So if it gets busy just be patient unless you think you can do better??"}
{"text":"Wow, so much attitude. Went on a Saturday night. On arrival we were informed that they are busy with take out and there would be a long wait. No issue, as you wait at any busy place. When ordering I tried to change a topping on a pizza. My request was abruptly declined, as  they informed no substitutions. We ordered 2 different pizza's. Both arrived soggy and average tasting. Cannelloni was bland and the gnocchi was decent. Bill was $100 for 4 people with no soft drinks. There are so many better options close by. No reason to return. Oh and the acoustics in this place suck. Only like 15 guests inside, and I was externally loud."}
{"text":"A solid 4 star restaurant In the GTA.  Came in on a Saturday night, around 7:30pm.  Place was busy and we were informed of a 15 min wait which was totally fine. We were sat at a big communal table in the middle of the restaurant which was completely OK and didn't affect our dining experience at all, unlike the other reviews below. Also, there is an extremely friendly hostess at the front that will sit you to your table. It's a casual, lively vibe, but not casual enough to sit yourself. The server was so incredibly nice and everything came in a timely manor. Only thing I would comment on is it's a little loud since it is a small space. So just be mindful of that.   For the food we order the Caprese Salad, the Salami Board and a Margarita Pizza. Everything was great but the star of the night was definitely the pizza!! Truly a great spot of a quick bite to eat, everything was fresh and I have no complaints here! I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Come here if you want a proper pizza. Ordered the Vivo - it was made perfectly, attached pics of what my friends and I ordered. Service is great too!"}
{"text":"We came here for a Birthday dinner.  The restaurant is small and with limited seats.  We booked a table in advance to make sure we get a seat.  They offer pizza and pasta.  We ordered salsicca pizza and rigatoni bolognese.  They are freshly made, however I would prefer the bolognese pasta to be softer because it is quite chewy.  The kitchen have a super big oven for making their pizza.  This is to ensure it comes out fresh.  The menu has a limited selection.  Most of their pizza are vegeterain."}
{"text":"Great place! Fresh pizza and pasta, very reasonable prices. The vivo insalada (spelling sorry) is amazing! We were there until about 9pm and they came out with free surprise dessert tasters for the whole house! Great hospitality."}
{"text":"I am torn how to rate this place. On one hand there were some obvious flaws, on the other hand the prices were very fair and pizza so delicious. I don't think that I would eat in again, but will likely do takeout 1-2 times before this restaurant changes hands for the nth time.  Tonight we split a generous and delicious caprese salad and two thin crust pizzas. The carmelized onions were quite crunchy, not good, but loved the rest of the pizza.  They had lots of people working in the kitchen, but not enough people serving the tables. The table beside us gave up and left they had been waiting so long to give their order. Not a relaxing experience."}
{"text":"Dining room is fairly bright, the setting is for casual gathering. Pizza are $14. Pizza size in my opinion is smaller than I expected but its big enough for light eater. Although ingredient is evenly distributed on the pizza and the taste is just right, however, I don't like the pizza is slightly burnt (I believe they intentionally make it burnt). The pizza dough, although nothing spectacular, but it is well made, it is soft but not oily. Overall, it is quite balanced and there is nothing fancy in their pizza, it is not loaded with cheese, nor filled with rich tomato sauce.  The pasta is also $14. The pasta itself is cooked just right, texture of the pasta is chewy. Flavor of the pasta sauce is mild, but not too creamy. However, at this price I would expect more excited ingredient added to the pasta instead of just some spices and flakes of chillies, garlic, and some basil.  Overall, Vivo's service is good and friendly, food overall taste good, presentation is average. In terms of value compared to it's quality, quantity, presentation, and class, in my opinion is not really worth it."}
{"text":"Napoli style restaurant finally hits Thornhill / Richmond Hill.  Amazing pizza and pasta dishes. I have been here a few time and love the food and the service. The food is very fresh and its a completely open kitchen which I love.  The chef and owners are really nice people and spend time with you to make sure you are happy with your meal and your choices.  Coffee and desserts are amazing.  I like the house made stuff... key to ask.  Small wine selection but enough for what you need here. Beer and other drinks are also available.  Very reasonably priced for the food that your getting here.  The atmosphere is also very modern and fun.  No reservations and very limited seating, so come early during dinner time. They can seat up to a party of 10 for a larger family.  And lots of small tables or 2 or 4 seats.  I have been here twice and have taken out food from here.  Love it as a quick go to spot if we need some good pizza, pasta and salad.  Thanks for the great times.  See you soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very classic Italian. We were told the pizza oven was shipped piece by piece from Italy! The owner was very kind and friendly and the atmosphere was warm. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The place has a nice setting and comfortable dinning space. The pizza was average for its price. They have a fancy Italian pizza oven and I had high hopes to be amazing. I think I jumped the gum on that one. It wasn't horrible but decent. We also ordered a spaghetti carbonara and that was a big disappointment. I'm glad they used fresh bacon but the sauce was horrible. It was practically over easy scrambled eggs on pasta. There was no technique in the sauce, the egg ingredient was over cooked. I can pick out clumps of egg whites."}
{"text":"Quick, casual and tasty! Come here for a fast dinner or take out! I had the Alfredo which was delish. The pizzas are all good...classic Italian thin crust. I really enjoy the  salads and apps as well. Nothing bad to say about this place, the foods about 8/10! Service 9/10! Ambiance 10/10."}
{"text":"The place is great! It looks like it's going to be a staple for me moving forward.  The pricing is spot on and so is the selection (Penne ala Vodka, tell your friends). The portion sizes are well allocated for a meal to keep one full. You can tell that the sauces are made fresh and the past was cooked al dente.  I'm all about this place. I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Vivo is the perfect little spot for an authentic Italian bite. to start the atmosphere makes you feel like your in a little part of Italy. Very modern and ascetically pleasing. I advise the arugula salad & the caprese with the fresh fiore di late to start. You can't go wrong with any pizza or pasta there as the pizza is made fresh in the huge pizza oven they have facing you to watch. The pasta is always my fav, watch out for the specials because the cannelloni with the ricotta inside and the rose sauce is a slice of nonna's house for me. finish the night off with and espresso or a cold espresso and you'll be singing \"on an evning in Roma\"out the damn door!"}
{"text":"Simple neighbourhood Italian eatery. Popped in on their second day of being open for business, and they were still working out their kinks but the food was honest. Opted for a penne arrabbiata, salumi board and a pizza margherita. Everything was fresh, flavourful, and well executed. The price points are fair, and it's nice to have a local option for an inexpensive, homemade plate of pasta."}
{"text":"Small chic place with delicious Italian fare. They use a wood-burning oven to make their pizza, which came out with the perfect crust. We had the Patata pizza and the penne vodka. Both dishes were tasty and exceeded our expectations. I like the fixed price for all their pastas and pizzas. Will definitely be back to try some others."}
{"text":"Vivo Pizza+Pasta reminds me of Levetto Similar concept but much better execution.  Menu is small and simple with: Antipasti ($9) Pizza/Pasta ($13) Secondi ($17) Dessert ($6)   Highly recommend their Wood Burning pizzas as the ingredients so fresh, crust so thin! I love my Prosciutto pizza! Rigatoni Al Ragu ($13) has a nice house made meat sauce and Caesar Salad ($9) was fresh and crisp! Their house made hot sauce is light in spice and big in flavour, remember to ask for it!  Service is fast and prompt. Might not be a date restaurant but great for a quick bite.  Good solid Italian food at a reasonable price. Space is small but have a great lively vibe."}
{"text":"Good pizza, nice sweet sauce and good mozerella. Cesar salad is a must! Only problem was that the staff were untrained and not very good. The people beside me had their table cleaned while they were sitting there. Not cool. Service is why this review is only 3 stars"}
{"text":"Genuinely good Italian pizzas and pastas in the suburbs. Food is delicious and authentic and the service is fast and friendly. I'm a big fan of all the quick italian places popping up in the suburbs and Vivo is one of the better ones!"}
{"text":"Small quaint, excellent pizza. Pasta was ok. Calamari was ok, nothing special. I'll stop in again and the pizza another go."}
{"text":"Hand built wood burning pizza oven serving up some of the most delicious pizza I have tasted in a long long time.   Fresh dough, fresh ingredients. Just the dough with some sauce is delicious. I didn't get a chance this visit to try the pasta, but it did look good.   The only thing that's not great about this place is the size. It is very very small. Expect a wait of at least 20/30 mins on a Friday or Saturday night.   I will def be back to try a couple of the pasta dishes and some more pizzas. Very impressed by the quality of the pizza.   3/5 for me!"}
