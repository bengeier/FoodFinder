{"text":"Would give it a zero if I could. Waited to be seated was ignored only to have two folks waiting  behind us who apparently were regulars be seated. Extraordinarily rude! We left .
Apparently they don't want new customers. Went to Drews down the road which is great."}
{"text":"If you are in the area and you need a place to dive in for some pancakes in the morning or a quick burger and don't feel like backtracking all the way to Drew's, Jodi B's isn't bad.  Not great. The food is overpriced for diner fare and this storefront restaurant does not look like it has been updated since the 1970s.  The music is invariably boring--musak renditions of old standards.  The service is warm and friendly and they will bend over backward to make you happy with your food."}
{"text":"Ive only had breakfast and brunch here but the food is pretty cheap and decent. Its not a fine dining restaurant but it is good to have a cheap meal with friends on a sunday morning while recovering from the night before."}
{"text":"I've ate breakfast at Jodi Bs a handful of times.  Each time there has been an issue whether it be slow service, waiting to pay, order not right.  I accept these issues in most breakfast restaurants but this service today is worth commenting on.  I was ignored at the door when I walked in.  Several employees saw me but none acknowledged me.  After seeing a few people just go and sit at a table, I asked the next employee I saw if I was to seat myself. He was kind enough to seat me and get me a glass of water.  The waitress was not so kind.  I made the mistake of calling a certain breakfast a special and she set me straight followed by \"what do you want\".  I asked for well done potatoes which came out close to raw.  The waitress must have sensed I was a bit irritated because she did not show up until she had the check in her hand and in a rough insincere voice said \"have a happy holiday\".  No one asked me how my breakfast was.  I guess they did not see the pile of raw potatoes left on my plate.  I agree with John C.  B = bad."}
{"text":"I try to like this place. It is local to me. Food is a bit better than ok, calling it OK. Service is not that good. They just do what they have to, to get food to you. The past 3 times I have eaten there, I have been by myself, so obviously check to be smaller than table for four. Same waitress each time. Very little eye contact, no dialogue whatsoever, even from others who work there and walk by you. Tab was $9.50, gave her a $20, and she comes back with 2 5's and change. Did she really think I would leave her a $5 tip. I did have a $2 bill, which I left. It has been like eating at a fast food joint, only with better food. Very Impersonal. If I could, I would leave 2 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here last week.  Not impressed in the least.  I pulled into the shopping center and it was so dark I was unsure if the restaurant was even open!  I walked in and there were approximately three tables with patrons there.  I ordered a regular breakfast (meat, potatoes, eggs, and toast).  I have to agree with an additional poster that this is home of the worlds smallest toast.  I had sausage, which I am pretty confident that it was brown and serve from the microwave.

Eggs were ok, potatoes were small and greasy.  Place just had a dirty feel.  I will not be running back here anytime soon.  There has to be better.  I ate here when it was the Plaza and that was better.  Plenty of room for improvement."}
{"text":"I've only had breakfast here. I used to love the place. It was yummy and cheap. But they changed their potatoes, in my opinion not for the better.  They don't let you substitute sides or offer turkey bacon or sausage. It forces me to have to buy a lot Ala cart and make my own meal. Not a bad place overall though."}
{"text":"I love Jodi B's. My usual Sunday morning place to go to when I don't want to make breakfast. The food takes homemade and the waitresses are amazing. I always recommend this place to anyone who lives around the area."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly! 
To me its like an upgraded mom and pops diner.
Everyone I've taken there loved it as well
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We had found a coupon on restaurants.com for this restaurant. Highly HIGHLY disappointed. To start, the staff gave us a hard time about trying to use a coupon. If you don't know how to run the coupons or don't want to deal, then don't advertise them online? The wait staff was probably the rudest I've ever seen. They make you feel extremely uncomfortable and make you feel that everything you ask for is a bother. Extremely difficult and unpleasant experience. All aside from the fact that the food well, sucked. Wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I live in the area of Jodi B's.
I would really like to give this place a better star rating, but I just can't. I have given this restaurant several attempts to earn a better rating, it is just not there. 

The service is lacking on so many levels. Friendliness and prompt service, not there.  The food is lacking in flavor or taste. I have had the dinner specials and the burgers, not impressed. The wait time is horrible. The food price is reasonable, but the quality of food is not. I believe is it family own and run. They do as little as possible. They have locals that come in every day, for company or just for lack of any place else to go, not saying that is a bad thing, but the voice level is so that  everyone in the restaurant can hear the conversation. This has been experienced on more than one occasion. I have not been there during brunch on a Sunday. I have only been there during the dinner hour on a week day. 

I was not impressed and will not return. They do have coupons available and no reservation is required."}
{"text":"A good place to go if you're in the mood for just a traditional breakfast. Prices are reasonable. Pretty outdated environment"}
{"text":"Great place with awesome prices and friendly service! I had one of the best hot turkey sandwiches I ever ate made with real turkey on toasted Texas toast and homemade mashed potatoes!  All for under $10!"}
{"text":"Super cheap for food. Not the best, but if you're starving, you'll eat anything. Super senior hangout."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and lunch, a little less so for supper. I've been here many times and the morning and midday service and food is consistently excellent. The evenings can be spotty though, with meal quality uneven as well as the wait staff. It's not the Ritz, so if you have easy to reasonable expectations chances are you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"Found out from a mutual friend that this establishment had changed ownership since the last time we were here (see my previous review). 

The ownership may have changed and the interior does look much nicer with updates and an added bar area but nothing else has improved. 

Barbie still makes the tiny toast, the so called \"home fries\" are Ore Ida frozen potato cubes ( we call them bag & spoon fries) and the overall portion sizes and quality is not good at all. 

We had high hopes for the new ownership but it looks likes Forest Hills will still be without a decent place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Family restaurant  and bar with great food and prices. The cheesesteaks are amazing and breakfast is just like moms."}
