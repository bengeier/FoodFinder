{"text":"Byo STEAKHOUSE.  Need I say more?  Prices are fair, salad and side included with your steak...AND you don't have to pay pricy restaurant markups for your favorite wine.   Go.  Then go again."}
{"text":"Nope ... nope nope nope  Went a sunday for brunch, the place wasn't packed at all and it took more than 50 minutes to have a simple breakfast. Two person at the table next to mine left before they received their meal because it was way too long.   The staff came up with 5 different excuses but I think they aren't ready to handle that new addition to the menu.  The food was also disappointing ... how hard it is to cook potatoes? Seriously ... we had something between mashed and sliced. They invented a brand new texture.   Not going again"}
