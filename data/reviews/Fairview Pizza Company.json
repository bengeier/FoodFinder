{"text":"I love their vegan tofu scrambler, biscuits, and coffee. The best evah. Joey and Ali are great hosts in this unique breakfast spot in Fairview. Daily specials too."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst pizza I've had in Asheville. I'm pretty sure they use premade frozen crust. Way over priced for the quality- comparable to little ceasars. I will say however they do have excellent breakfast sandwiches and are open earlier than just about every other place. Also- I'm sorry to give 1 star because the owner is a nice guy. The bottom line is - the pizza is low quality. The reason I am writing this review is because I saw their 4.5 star rating, but now I am VERY disappointed because the pizza sucks. I grew up in the Northeast where we do pizza right. Maybe folks down south don't know what good pizza is supposed to be like, but this is definitely not it."}
{"text":"Great lunch today!   Italian sub and pasta salad.  Ready for more.  Will be back with the family."}
{"text":"The pizza is mediocre. My medium pepperoni pizza had more cheese showing than pepperoni!   The flavor was okay, but not exceptional.  The service was okay, but certainly not exceptional.  
It makes me sad to post this because I'd love to support a local business, but the 4 of us were not impressed."}
{"text":"Family-owned and operated pizza joint where the Pizza and More used to be, and much better, in my opinion! The white pizza with spinach and extra cheese is now my favorite pizza anywhere in the local area, and their garden salad with ranch dressing is amazing! So good! I hope they find much success in Fairview."}
{"text":"Another amazing breakfast here.  We we thinking about driving into Asheville to Tupelo or Early Girl and decided to stop by again and support this new local unassuming restaurant and are thrilled we did.  My wife and I agree that we could not have had a more delicious breakfast anywhere in our area, in fact if we lived in downtown Asheville if would be worth driving the 15-20 minutes for this amazingly delicious food.  I had the special Blueberry French Toast and my wife had the Zuchinni Benefict.  A rustic and simple place, great food and coffee!!"}
{"text":"Great local pizza. We aren't from the area and wanted something that wasn't a chain and they were great. Friendly service in a great area. We love to eat local so this was perfect.  Has a simple pepperoni pie and a sub. Recommend for anyone who likes good local food. They deliver too if you need that."}
{"text":"Fast & friendly service. Fresh ingredients, yummy crust & original sauce. Delicious pizza."}
{"text":"While the pizza is very good, it is way too expensive!  $45.00 for dinner is a splurge for our family.  While we enjoyed the change of pace, we are going to stick to other places for Pizza that are more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Proof that nailing the basics really counts. My expectations were really blown away. I was surprised to see how tasty Fairview's pizza was- it wasn't because they had exotic ingredients or an Italian chef or anything fancy. The quality of the cheese was premium and it set the rest of the bite up for success. They had a great ratio of sauce to crust and the dough was tasty too. No flimsy slices, good cook on it!

Would highly recommend if you need to grab a pie and are in the area. Everyone around here recommended Piazza down the road, but I'd definitely recommend supporting Fairview too!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a tasty pizza at the newly opened \"Fairview Pizza\" on Charolotte Highway.  We really appreciated the freshness of the tomatoe and green pepper toppings on a generiously shredded cheese \"traditional\" pizza.  Andrew says that future plans include outdoor dining as well as beer on the menu. Very clean and filled with delicious yeasty smells.   We'll be back to try one of the speciality gourmet pizzas"}
{"text":"We are locals and our friends had been telling us to try the Pizza Company for breakfast for a while now. I'm so happy we finally listened to them. I had a breakfast sandwich which was both huge and delicious and my husband had the special a Greek omelet with home fries and a biscuit, he raves about his too. The coffee was delicious, the service was stellar and the price was excellent."}
