{"text":"This establishment is definitely not worth your time or your money. The food is terribly inept and downright disgusting. I have been here a few times and it's been less than favourable each time. Their pizza is flavourless and bland. To say it pales in comparison with other great pizzas the city is known for wouldn't even begin to describe how horrible it truly is. I've lived in the area now for almost 4 years and this particular location is going on it's 4th owner now and each time seems to be getting worse with this current owner seemingly worse than all others combined. The area needs a decent pizza place and it's disappointing to put it mildly that this particular location continues to  fail so miserably."}
{"text":"They had very favourable reviews on Just-Eat so I went with them. Ordered a deep dish pizza and received extra thick cardboard with mushrooms glued on top. I would have been fine receiving this as normal pizza because that's Toronto and we have no good pizza here. But don't get me all hot and bothered over deep dish deliciousness and give me this... 
Also order jalape√±o poppers... Picked one up and if morphed around my hand, it was so soggy. Had to cook it in my oven for an additional 15 mins on 400"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the positive reviews are paid ads because I wouldn't wipe my ass with the \"pizza\" they had. The customer service i experienced was terrible. Waited 35 minutes for a \"pizza\" when there were no other customers. Order was made wrong, whatever, i don't have another 35 minutes to wait. Crust felt rock hard and dry. Ugh."}
{"text":"Trying their pizza for the first time, pepperoni with sesame garlic crust. The crust is a delicious alternative to what you get anywhere else. 
The pepperoni is cooked perfectly, not over done just enough so the edges were nice and crispy. Well worth the price. The staff there are super friendly and easy to talk to, Abe especially. Was definitely welcomed after a long night at work."}
{"text":"i'm shocked at the low reviews to the point of questioning my sanity, as I swear the last time I checked out the reviews on here, there were many more, and much higher. 

Anyways, I felt like taking the time to write a review because my experiences thusfar with this place have been consistently good. 

you might take a look at the surrounding hood and the quaint seating area and assume that the food will be sketchy, but you would be wrong. compared to other generic pizza places in the area, hand's down, this place is much better!

Granted, i'm not a pizza connoisseur, and i've only tried their wings and shawarma pizza, but both have been shockingly good. 

Customer service has also been top notch for me, i live on king street and they've offered free delivery for me because i live close by, they're always friendly, and if i'm guessing correctly, the owner is one sexy beefcake.
so at the very least, ordering from here, you'll get to gawk at his gargantuan pecs."}
