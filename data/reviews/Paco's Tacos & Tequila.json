{"text":"Easily the most disappointing Mexican restaurant experience since I moved to Charlotte. Now, I will say the tacos were pretty good. We tried a few variations between the two of us. Perhaps this isn't fair, being from South Florida but how dare these people call that shameful drink a margarita. It was awful and for eight dollars (the house), it should have been spectacular. Of course we didn't learn our lesson. My husband ordered a fourteen dollar margarita, in a vain attempt at putting the last one behind us. If you like battery acid and mediocre food, go there."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here was quickly seated the waitress was very nice and helpful to my coworker and I who are first timers to charlotte. I highly recommend the guacamole they have side dishes for two bucks if you don't want to spend nine on the big bowl. Their chicken taco with cilantro was awesome, wasn't big into their side dish red rice it slaw but the taco and guacamole more then made up for it. Reasonably pieced too for seven bucks. Will be returning here when I am on my next business trip"}
{"text":"Great service and the food has been excellent in our past visits too. Will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the calamari taco and brisket taco.The salsa was way too salty :( sadly. The plate came with a choice of 2tacos rice beans and cole slaw. I got rice only and my cousin did substitute the slaw for another side she picked the butter corn which was also good. We were a party of 4 and went on a Thursday night with no wait at 8."}
{"text":"Great tacos and margaritas.  Really enjoyed my chips and salsa and great craft beers.  Spot in place and best to come during happy hour."}
{"text":"Call me crazy but this has everything I want in a Mexican food place. Great chips and salsa. Great guac. Amazing Volcano Queso. The food is fast and the beer and margaritas are cold. They've got TVs to watch the game and an outdoor area when the weather is nice. I've never had a bad experience here and it's one of my \"go-to\" Mexican food spots in the area."}
{"text":"Paco's Tacos did not disappoint! It has great food and the excellent service that you've come to expect from the FS Food Group. I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food and drinks. Which is why it's a shame I won't be coming back. The last two times I dined with you I witnessed managers yelling at employees. A female manager jad gathered servers in the kitchen and started yelling and cursing about something. My children even remarked about the \"bad words\" she used. Normally I would brush this off as maybe a bad day but it was the second time I noticed this. My previous visit an older gentlemen yelled about dirty tables. I think asking for help will get you further rhan berating employees. Your servers are most likely hard working and under paid as it is. I refuse to support an establishment that treats employees that way. It's unfortunate.  I feel horrible for your staff.  There are better ways to communicate issues and more effective means of dealing with problems besides yelling and cursing."}
{"text":"Love this place.  My favorite taco place in Charlotte.  My GF and go here at least twice a month.  Get the brisket, it's da bomb"}
{"text":"Service has been the best. Extremely attentive host and waiter. Food and margaritas equally good.  Tops in my book in charlotte for tex-mex."}
{"text":"First experience here!  Love the music and décor!  Waiter seemed to 'roll his eyes' when I was thinking about what  kind of taco I wanted.  The tortilla soup was poor.  Served in very small bowl and the chips on top overtook the actual soup.  Taco was good but for what I paid, it wasn't full, like most Mexican Restaurants serve tacos. Very skimpy. Waiter left work so we had the hostess helping us and then she left?  Had to take my bill to the front.  Poor experience."}
{"text":"Very well may be the best shrimp tacos I've ever had, slightly crispy. Really good guac, can do the make at the table variety but I opted just for a side. The house made salsa was real good and the table side Mex hot sauce had kick! They have the \"healthy\" tortilla options which is nice as well. The Paco Taco was bomb and be sure to get the Charro beans - so good! $2 pint of Shiner doesn't hurt their case either.  True Tex-Mex taco shop with all the random Texas decor on the walls.   If you are in Southpark area - this is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, & Tequila! Will definitely stop by again on my next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Paco's taco is a unique, awesome taste and they have the best Chicken Tortilla Soup that I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Lunch on a Friday One guest had grilled chicken burrito that was the days special. I had veggie quesadilla and both entrees were delicious. Service was great and it appears that everyone works together to make your experience pleasant. Prices reasonable and chips and salsa were very fresh. Will definately go back."}
{"text":"Much better than Cantina 1511! The salsa verde was really good. I was a bit disappointed at the fact that they had to smother my enchiladas in queso to make them vegetarian - where's the enchilada sauce!? - but it was pretty decent. I will likely go back ... and next time, have a margarita. They looked yummy."}
{"text":"Paco's does quite pack enough punch for my taste.  Due to location, it's incredibly popular, and there's usually a wait for tables.  No worries - you can put your name on the list and grab a seat at the bar while you wait to be called.  Oddly enough, when I asked for one of the buzzers to notify me when our table was ready, I was told that its range was really bad and it might not go off, even though the bar was 6 feet away.  Luckily, the anticipated 45-50 minute wait was cut to only ~30 minutes, and we grabbed the pitcher of blood orange margaritas to drink at our table.     While our server and service was fine, I unfortunately found the food to be unremarkable, with the free chips & salsa being the best thing all night (although Ben mentions the tomatillo salsa, we only received the smokey red one).   We started with the table side guacamole, and while it was heartily devoured, it lacked much heat or flavor outside fresh avocado.  I ordered three tacos and tried the chicken, skirt steak, and ground beef options.  On the plus side, with three tacos, rice, and my choice of charro, refried, or black beans, there was more than enough food; on the con side, none of it was overly remarkable... in fact, there wasn't much to remember on any part of my plate.    Of all the Frank Scibelli's restaurants, Paco's proves to be my least favorite.  I've tried it twice and have been underwhelmed both times.  Maybe third time's the charm, but with all the other great eateries around town, I don't know if I'll give Paco's a final chance to wow."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat in Charlotte. My BF LOVES (yes...an all CAPS kind of feeling) the Pacos Taco. I usually switch it up and try something different all the time. I've never had anything I didn't like.  One thing I get every time is the El Dorado Margarita on the rocks...I'm not a huge Margarita fan, but this one is tasty!! The service is usually pretty awesome...the chips/salsa are fresh and we have a hard time not filling up on those and the queso (white cheese) that we always order.  We are definite fans of this place and go at least 3 times a month."}
{"text":"I don't know if there is a real Paco out there , but I want to kiss him. Hard! This is by far the best Mexican/Texmex I've  tasted thus side of the country.  Yeea-haw, Señor Paco. Ride on! Ps: fajitas are pricey but come with a whole second plate of fixins, and for my tacos, I mixed and matched and the brisket in tacos was Di-Vine! I'm really happy now...purr-purr"}
{"text":"Absolutely love pacos!!!! Phenomenal food for an amazing price! Pacos hits it out of the park every time I come!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this place and everything from the service to the food was amazing. The server Robert was excellent and knew  the menu really well. Some of the best salsa I've had at a Mexican restaurants and the tacos were well portioned so you can really get away with just one for your meal. Will definitely be back to this place!"}
{"text":"Every time I am Charlotte I will eat here. We wound up here because it was right behind our hotel. The atmosphere is fun. The food selection is great and very reasonably priced. If you like pork go for the Al Pastor taco. The free salsa was delish with a nice little kick. I want to go back again tonight!"}
{"text":"Really good food, prices are okay considering the location.  A little bit of a corporate chain feel, but the food is very good.  Chicken quesadilla has carmelized onions which really put it over the top.  Also had the tres leches for desert which was awesome.  Give it a try"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend the other day and I have to say hands down best steak quesadillas in town! I had the wood grilled skirt steak quesadillas. I also had their watermelon margarita which was very refreshing. The service was also great. I will definitely be going there again!"}
{"text":"This is decent tex-mex. I had the \"pacos taco's\" and they were pretty good. Not a fan of the beans and I love beans. My margarita was ok but they are not generous with the tequila. We were there for lunch and it was not really busy. I could tell from the set up that they probably have a great happy hour."}
{"text":"We ate here in late Dec.  Food was good, service was excellent, atmosphere enjoyable.  The problem was that we both had real stomach issues the next day.  Has anyone else had a problem?"}
{"text":"Possibly the best restaurant in Charlotte. Tacos are amazing especially the Al Pastor. Large portions, great list of beers and tequila. Can't say enough great things about this place. A must try!"}
{"text":"this place is consistently great. i have been here so many times and have never had a bad meal or bad experience. the shake down shrimp tacos are delicious and it is more than enough food. their salsa is also great! perfectly spiced. would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great.  A really nice atmosphere and great place for kids.  I read the food reviews in advance and tried the chicken taco and my husband had the chicken taco and bbq shrimp taco combo.  The tacos were great, although, beware, the bbq taco is quite spicy like it states, but very tasty.  The portions were large.  I ordered a single taco, beans and rice and was full and my husband had the two taco combo and was stuffed (guess it could have been those two beers as well!).  He was also pleasantly satisfied with the beer selection.  For those who have small children, the cheese quesadillas are quite tasty.  Generous with the cheese and not grilled to a hard exterior like most places.  And all kids meals come with a free scoop of real vanilla ice cream.  That kept our 20 month old busy for a while.  And the customer service, albeit it the place is still relatively new and trying to make a good impression, was outstanding.  We are pretty picky when it comes to restaurants and it's nice to have a good option for good food when you're in the mood for mexican.  We will definitely be going back and I would highly recommend it if you haven't tried it already."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! I HATE tex mex with a passion and I was weary to try it out but we will definitely be back! It was seriously so good! I got the house margarita for $5 and the tequila they used was high end. The queso dip and salsa were both spot on. I got the veggie enchiladas and they were to die for! Smothered in a black bean sauce they were seasoned well with goat cheese inside. A-maz-ing. My date got three tacos, the fried chicken was his favorite but the steak one was a little fatty he said. Other than that, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fun restaurant located in the very popular South Park area. Made an 830p reservation and were sat within minutes of our arrival. Justin our waiter was on point and incredibly friendly. It was restaurant week. We opted to order off the menu instead of have the $30 per person coursed meal. We ordered Guac for the table. While it's made table size, they never asked how spicy we wanted it and overall I thought it was too bland to order again. Next time we will try the chorizo queso. The shrimp tacos are very tasty and pineapple margaritas amazing. Our table enjoyed the peanut butter pie as well. Service is quick but they don't rush you out. We will be back."}
{"text":"Definitely the best tex Mex restaurant in South Park! Everything is good but the stuffed jalapeños and the brisket tacos are my favorite. Service is always great, too."}
{"text":"With all the great reviews we decided to try this place.   Wasn't happy, of course were used to Texas Mexican food.   The refried beans taste funny to us.  The tacos weren't anything to writ about.  I guess a lot of NC's love this place,  but we won't be back.  We r too spoiled with our Mexican restaurants in Texas."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I have ever had. The service was spectacular! (Jaun L)  Drinks and chips were constantly refilled and the food came out quickly.  Up there with just about the best Mexican we've ever had. Tacos are excellent and everything is very fresh. I can see why this place is so busy.  A must go for anyone that likes Mexican."}
{"text":"excellent food and service. not your average tex mex. the avocado cream is outstanding - never had it before. i recommend the chicken enchiladas. this place is just what south park needs!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic meal! Shawna the Manager on shift was amazing. She visited our table at least three times and at exactly the right time. Wait staff was as good as any that we have experienced including high end restaurants.   Now to the food - guacamole was simple but excellent- margarita with no name was simple but excellent - Paco's tacos - shrimp - turkey were the best.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: a little noisy but not unbearable. Fun decor. Good energy.   Food: Chips and salsa solidly delicious. I had the combo plate - everything was pretty great, but didn't knock my socks off from a flavor perspective.   Service: Tyler was awesome. Super friendly and took care of everything we needed   Drink: I probably should have asked about what was in the Mexican Mule. It tasted pretty much like a margarita but pretty sweet and sour. Not my favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Awesome Tex-mex menu options, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a regular stop for my co-workers and I during the week.  I normally get one of the enchilada meals but last week decided to try the Taco Salad and it was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation but still had to wait a long time to be seated.  The food was Ok but for the price not that great."}
{"text":"Good chips and salsa? good guac? Check! Location and ambiance? OK.   Service:  It had potential to be good but our server kept coming back every ten minutes, even after we told her we would be taking out time. Maybe she had good intentions, but we felt very rushed. It was later in the night and although the restaurant was kind of full, there wasn't a wait for other customers.   Veggie tacos: LITTERALLY some cabbage. That's it. Oh, and one slice of a pepper. Huh?"}
{"text":"Great food, great drink and great service. Every time I have been here, which is often has been a great meal.   The tacos, burritos and enchiladas are amazing and trumped only by the cheese dip. They could stand to have a better beer menu, but that's the only flaw I can find. Eat here and I'd get the tequila flight if you are a tequila fab."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good.  Glad we made the reservation.  There was a 45 minute wait but we walked right in and sat right down.  Nice Job Paco's Tacos!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Attentive service. Dining room was a bit dated but otherwise great value for the price."}
{"text":"The hubs and I visited for lunch over the weekend. We started with white queso and added ground beef. The chips seemed very fresh and like most queso, we made it disappear quickly. The salsa was excellent. We both ordered enchiladas. His were \"de Dennis\" and looked a lot better than my run of the mill cheese enchiladas. Service was prompt and friendly. We will definitely give it another go."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!  It's my new favorite!  Delicious Mexican!!  And, what makes it really great are the AMAZING margaritas!  It is SO worth paying a little extra for quality top shelf.  Service is always 5 stars as well!"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend on a Friday night, made reservations for 6pm. Sat at a 4 top which was nice. Chris was out waiter, he was awesome. Knowing this was our first time there he gave us some suggestions. Atmosphere was good, family friendly too. We'll definitely be going back with a couple of our foodie friends soon. Oh, and the margaritas are on point too."}
{"text":"I like this place for its drinks and food. Nothing fancy but reasonably priced good  food. Great after work stop  for a drink or cold brew salsa and chips. Friendly staff. Definitely Tex-mex with good brisket. The tacos are the draw, but there are lots of other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Good, inexpensive Tex-Mex food. Nothing really outstanding, but a fun place to go."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food excellent and staff very friendly.  I've been many times and always consistent experience!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE Pacos Tacos!! Every time I dine here they deliver - good service, tasty food and fun upbeat atmosphere. I recommend going if you haven't been and make to order the table side guacamole and the signature Paco taco!"}
{"text":"Had 3 tacos: Al pastor - Paco taco - Smokey Brisket....Came with rice, slaw and ordered refried beans.  All 3 tacos were horrible...rice and slaw no flavor.  Salsa and chips were good.  Service was ok.  This is not a Mexican Restaurant by any means. $13 for 3 tacos? Not unless the cow or pig was brought from the Sahara desert.  First and last time for me."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a Mexican restaurant for Americans. What I mean by that is the food is not too complicated, yet completely delicious and a great place to go when you're looking to fill a \"chips and salsa\" void. I've been here at least five times and I haven't yet been disappointed.   It's a great place for a group of young people looking to have a good time and drink margaritas ... as well as a great place for a family with small children. It accommodates just about anyone ... young or old. And that's why I like it.   Before I dined at Paco's Tacos I thought it was a \"dive type place\" with cheap Mexican food. The name kind of led me to think that.   Well, once I finally went to Paco's I discovered it's just the opposite. It's not a little \"Mom and Pop\" place, nor is it a dive restaurant. Paco's is not super cheap but also not crazy expensive. It's a little more upscale than the majority of Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area. With that said, if you're looking for fancy, there are a few nicer upscale \"Spanish influenced/Mexican restaurants\" in the Charlotte area.  Anyway, as far as Paco's Tacos goes this place is yummy. They give you chips and salsa like all Mexican restaurants and are great with refilling both as needed. There salsa is chunky and slightly spicy and really gets your taste buds going.   The past few times I've been there I've ordered the Taco's. You can get two or three it's up to you and the options are endless.    They give you the choice of house made flour tortillas, house made wheat tortillas, low carb tortillas, crispy yellow tacos or soft corn tortillas. \"I like the crispy tacos\". Normally when I'm going to Paco's I'm craving Americanized Mexican food and this place is perfect for that. When I'm craving more complicated Spanish influenced food I go somewhere else ... but that's another review.  Your taco meal is served with red rice and citrus chipotle slaw and your choice of charro, black or refried beans. I really like both the black and refried beans.  I normally get two tacos but my three favorite to choose from are the:  GRINGO BEEF Taco Seasoned ground beef, lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole and mixed cheeses. \"Very all American\"  PACO'S TACO - a slightly spicy Beef Brisket Taco. Before you get it the chili rubbed beef brisket is slow roasted for 6 hours with caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce. YUM!  or the:  WOOD GRILLED CHICKEN Onions and bell peppers, lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole and mixed cheeses \"This one just tastes fresh and delicious\"   I've had a ton of other things at Paco's but I keep coming back to these three taco choices. They're just YUMMY!  If you're looking for a drink and aren't sure what to get their margaritas are perfect. I'm pretty simple when it comes to drinks so I go with a traditional margarita on the rocks with salt. Try it you won't be sorry.   If you're looking for a starter while waiting for your entree go with this one:   UNHOLY GUACAMOLE 9 Yum ... and the best part is it's made fresh at your table.   Honestly you can't go wrong if you stick with the Mexican staples. The food won't disappoint and the ambiance is great for just about anyone.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and LOVE this place! Service is quick and friendly and the food is always delicious. The unholy guacamole and queso is a must - they make the guac right in front of you exactly the way you like it!! Single taco + salad is a great deal for those that can't help but gorge themselves on the salsa and bottomless chips beforehand. This place rocks, I've never been disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding meal and fun place to eat. My wife and I enjoyed the drinks, the atmosphere, and the wonderful food. Excellent service! The chips and salsa -really good. When dining for Mexican food in Charlotte, we will definitely be coming back. Try the quesadilla or the chimichanga - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this tex-mex restaurant. The tacos, especially Paco's taco, a brisket taco, cannot be beat. Unfortunately, they \"had\" the best fish taco, but changed the recipe and the new one is not the same caliber. When choosing a restaurant I look for drink specials, quality of food, and atmosphere. This place hits all 3 well! Would prefer TV viewing from all tables in case a game is on and I want to post up. There can be a wait and not always able to get my preference of table to meet this goal."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Their guacamole is one of the best!  Love their brisket tacos too!  Love coming here!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on food and experience. I did not get to partake of any tequilas or margaritas, but I was not looking to drink alcohol on this lunch occassion.  To start with, we ordered some chili con queso. Our server then prompted us, \"do you want the white queso, or the chili con queso?\". Only the chili con queso is listed in the menu, so I had to ask about the white queso. $5 gets you a small bowl of Velveeta product with some rotel in it. Something you can easily make at home.   For lunch we ordered a chicken quesadilla (for my partner) and I ordered the chopped salad. Once again, we were prompted with an option that is not listed in the menu- \"would you like the small salad, or the large salad?\" Our server had a hard time explaining the difference in size, but eventually she got it out. I'm glad I got the small size, but if you want the small size and you want to add chicken to it like I did, be prepared for a $11 salad. The dressing was tossed in with the salad, but I wish I'd asked for it on the side, because I was underwhelmed with the overall flavor of the salad as a whole. The chicken appeared to be pounded out flat, and was dry. Nothing special here.  While we were waiting on our food, I took a look around at some other plates...Now, I get that the tacos are what they're known for, but $11 for two tacos is just absurd in my mind. I am a taco afficianado, and the ones that i saw on other plates just didn't look all that great. Best way to serve a taco is simply corn tortilla, meat, onions, and cilantro. Authentic, and less than $2 at a true mexican restaurant. I get that it's tex mex, but if you're out for authenticity, Paco's Taco's is not the place to go. Venture on to South Blvd, or Eastway if you want the real deal.... you could feed four people for the price of two here."}
{"text":"love this place! they have the best fajitas ever, and they use amazing ingredients. The bbq buttered corn is my favorite side... i dont get the beans and rice so they will give me two sides of corn instead.very accommodating. my favorite place to eat Mexican. the drinks are great too!"}
{"text":"My visit to Paco's Tacos was mixed.  I was immediately disappointed to learn that they no longer offered the option to \"build your own\" margarita. I had been looking forward to that after reading about it in a number of reviews.  Instead I ordered from their decent list of \"specialty\" margaritas. I had the Paco's Eldorado on the waitress' recommendation. It was good margarita, but perhaps a bit too sweet for me. In fairness, the waitress said it was one of the sweeter ones and she was right.. For my second drink, I had the Firestarter which has their homemade jalapeno-infused tequila and ginger beer. This drink was really good, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has a low tolerance for spicy food but I would definitely order it again.  For my meal I had the three taco combo.  First up was the Paco's Taco, a beef brisket taco \"slow roasted chili rubbed beef brisket with caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce.\"  This one had come highly rated from a friend and several of the online reviewers.  Honestly I don't get it.  What I got was a tortilla with a huge lump of dry flavorless meat. I didn't detect any onion or bbq at aall. A huge let down.  Next I had the Big River Fish Taco. This was better than the Paco's Taco. The mango salsa was a nice touch.   Finally the Shake Down Shrimp Taco. This was by far the best of my three tacos. Nice flavor and the right amount of shrimp.  The shrimp were not as hot as I would have liked but tasty nonetheless.  The complementary chips and salsa (both red and verde) were good and the staff did a great job keeping our chip bowl full.  Our waitress was also quite good and checked on us frequently but not so much as to be a nuisance."}
{"text":"Well, Charlotte's access to Tequila certainly does NOT suck! I wrote a Guide to Tequila last year for a magazine, and got great help at Paco's. We received tremendous service, despite the place being typically jam-packed on weekends. The tacos are always good, though I have seen some limpid side salads here every so often..."}
{"text":"I came on a mini vacation to Charlotte, and decided to try Paco's Tacos. It was a great pick. The waiter was very attentive and welcoming to our needs. I highly recommend, the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant with excellent atmosphere and delicious food to boot. Ask for Lance...the best waiter and bartender in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Not many bad things to say- chips weren't hot and needed a little salt but main dish was amazing.You have the choice of whole wheat or white flour, crunchy, or low carb tortillas. I got one pacos taco (beef brisket, queso fresco, cabbage, caramelized onions & cilantro) and a turkey club carnitas taco (shredded turkey, avocado, lettuce, jalapeno bacon, tomato, avocado ranch )both on whole wheat tortillas- the turkey was UNbelievable. Came with choice of charro beans (pintos cooked with brisket and bacon), black, or refried and a side of rice and slaw. Pretty big crowd for a Tuesday night, would recommend getting there before 6 on a weekday, and earlier on a weekend."}
{"text":"Very good - higher end- Mexican food.  Very unique tacos.  I got the bbq flavored taco and the shrimp taco.  Would definitely order again.  Clean, good service, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are so fresh and tasty that I could fill up on just those. They're addictive! We love the Paco's Taco with braised beef and charro beans. They have so many different tequilas & their drink menu is extensive and impressive. Margaritas are unbelievable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place as we were heading out of town from a business trip. It was a southwestern type authentic Mexican food restaurant. We both had tacos. I had the skirt steak taco and husband had skirt steak taco and their Paco taco. Lots of choices for different types of tortillas and beans. Both plates of food came with choice of beans. We tried the retried and black beans which were both good as well as their rice. It was too early for margaritas as it was on a Sunday and NC law requires you wait till 12 to drink. NC residents should vote that law away- lol. Great place for Mexican food. Service excellent."}
{"text":"YIPEEEEE HALF-PRICED FAJITAS EVERYDAY 4-6!   Whoops, I got carried away.  Shall we proceed with the review?    I can't believe I've driven by this place so many times, and missed it's existence.  Tucked away in the back corner of the shopping center featuring William Sonoma and Bricktops, you almost have to know it's there or you could miss it.   The service was really friendly, quick, unpretentious, and as soon as we sat down, a bowl of hot crispy chips appeared at our table, with two salsas.    I was THRILLED with my steak and shrimp combo fajitas.  The tortillas are made fresh in house. LOTS of juicy, caramelized peppers and onions, and some kind of butter melted over it for extra decadence. Plenty of toppings and goodies (which is what I love about fajitas!) mean lots of ooey-gooey-drip-down-your-hand-and-arm goodness.   Our server also recommended the Paco's Tacos and shrimp tacos, which were also super flavorful.  The brisket is smoked for 6 hours, and extra tender, perfectly seasoned...the shrimp, breaded and fried, and a bit sweet from the cabbage. If I weren't such a fajita fanatic, I would have downed both tacos.   Notes: Lots of drink specials.  Manager walked around to check up on us several times. Nice dining room area with booths and TV's...another bar area with LOTS of tequila, and another side section of dark polished wood stools...and an outdoor seating area. Next time we have friends in town, this would be a good place to have a gathering.   Bottom Line:  I'm not a connoisseur of Mexican or Tex Mex or whatever Paco Taco is associated with...but it's mighty tasty, and just feels like a comfortable restaurant I'd like to come back to again and again.   PS:  Had the fried ice cream...which is good, but what I liked about it was the marshmallow fluff on the side!"}
{"text":"Excellent fajitas, queso, and pacos tacos. Good prices. Good atmosphere. Great service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and since it was a rainy cold day and I was walking this looked like a great choice for an early dinner.  When I got there I was promptly greeted and took a seat at the bar.  I ordered a bowl of the Chicken Enchilada soup and it was huge!  It was filled with pulled chicken and was certainly a meal all of its own!  The flavor was good, but was missing something in the broth.  That being said, I would definitely order it again but just a cup so I could try more tacos!  The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa had a great slightly smoky taste.  They were fantastic!  The bartender also made me a margarita on the rocks and it was really good, however it was too sweet for my taste and I didn't even finish it completely!  I really wanted to try a \"street\" taco and ordered a fish taco.  It was good, the batter was a bit salty, but overall it was good!   I will definitely go back on my next trip to Charlotte to try something else on the menu as overall this was a very tasty meal and I would recommend it.  The price was relatively inexpensive and was a good value for the quantity."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and we were seated quickly. The menu had plenty of options and I went with the soup/salad on a rainy day. The tortilla soup and chopped salad with smoked pork hit the spot! I will return and recommend this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"These posers don't allow dogs on their patio. Way to turn away customers! Suck it nerds!!"}
{"text":"Great food and always get good service reservations really help when you want to get seated quickly, the house is always packed!"}
{"text":"Good food and excellent service!  Had the brisket and bbq shrimp tacos with charro beans and rice.  All excellent! (and mine was not fatty at all)  Also they have a good beer, margarita, and tequila menu!  Best of all - the service was great.  Our server was attentive and personable and really seemed interested in our comments on the meal.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 is because I think they are still working out some of the menu items since it is so new and I am not sure I am a fan of the warm tomato-y salsa (although the chips were great!).  I will go back!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!! The customer service was great and everyone was very pleasant. The food was really good and even though my taco came out cold they took it back and brought me a fresh hot one in a timely manner. Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu. The pineapple mint margarita was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Texas, we are continually on the hunt for great Mexican food. Sadly, we will have to continue hunting. All 3 of us had their fajitas, and we were all dissapointed. Both the chicken and beef were bland, the onions and green peppers over cooked with strong butter flavor, and the beans were not \"tasty\". Why the 3 stars then? Well, they are doing the tortilla shells correctly. Freshly made, and very good. Its a start. And their chips were great, and service prompt and friendly. Hopefully they improve everything else...(along with their marg prices. $14 for a reg size. Really?)"}
{"text":"After my 3rd visit, I figure I owe this place a review. I originally discovered this place one Sunday afternoon while in search of a bad-ass margarita. Winner Winner Chicken Dinner! The cocktail list, or rather, Margarita list is awesome. I usually don't care for new twists on classic cocktails, but these guys got it right. I suggest the \"Firestarter\" a vodka martini w/ fresh muddled Jalapenos, it's aptly named. And their newest addition, \"the Ruslty El Camino\" which is essentially a classic margarita w/ blood orange puree. Their tacos are awesome, even if you don't eat meat: check out their whitefish taco, or their calamari taco, they both rock. Bonus points: I took a vegan, and there were numerous options, all of which she enjoyed. It's hidden in South Park, so I've never had to wait for a table, and they play great music: lots of Wilco, Johnny Cash, and even a little Drive By Truckers. Great, now I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican taqueria? Nope! Paco's Tacos is unabashedly Tex-Mex fusion at its best. Shortly after opening, it became our go-to spot in South Park and hasn't fallen from its lofty perch.  I honestly haven't had a bad item on the menu, but some of my favorites are the (free!) tomatillo salsa, the Shakedown Shrimp taco and the fajitas. Yes! Fajitas! These aren't your typical chain restaurant fajitas, but ones made with top notch ingredients fried in drawn Mexican butter. Oh, and don't forget about the namesake Paco's Taco, made with spice, tender beef brisket barbecue, that sums up the Tex-Mex fusion philosophy perfectly. And the margaritas are good, especially the tequila infused Firestarter. And the guacamole. And the specials. And they always have a Shiner Bock seasonal on tap. And... OK, you get the idea, right? At Paco's Taco's, it's ALL good!"}
{"text":"Awesome shrimp tacos. Best mexican rice! Tabelside guacamole! !!! Great service. Looking forward to being a regular."}
{"text":"We ate here as a family with some out of town guests. Everything about it was fine. The food was fine. The service was fine. We ordered the guacamole app and everyone liked it. My son and I split the fajitas and the chicken was decent. Overall, I would go there again if someone really wanted to but felt like I could make better Mexican at home. The food was far from authentic and it is a Mexican restaurant for people who consider The Olive Garden to be real Italian food."}
{"text":"Why did you change the chips and flour tortillas!? They were the best part about this place. Definitely a few of the things that set you apart from other Mexican restaurants in the area. My husband and I were so bummed the past couple of times we have been in. The changes might not be noticed by newcomers but if your loyal paco's fans you notice the difference right away!"}
{"text":"The bacon wrapped jalapenos can't be missed. Also don't forget to eat the enchiladas deDennis, whoa!!! Wait staff is friendly and service is quick!!"}
{"text":"While this isn't Mexican food per se, it is really decent for Americanized Tex-Mex. Very friendly and attentive service, good decor. The margaritas are made with lime juice, not sour mix; always a welcome item. Fresh made table side guacamole is really good as well, and can be tailored for spice/seasoning level. I usually get the Enchiladas De Dennis, but the fajitas are good too, and the charro beans are on point.  Great place for lunch too, they service a large business park, and know how to turn and burn for lunch time."}
{"text":"Ive been here a number of times now and can safely say its one of my favorite tex mex restaurants in town. To me its Mexican with a texas kick. its not your traditional Mexican menu. I like that!  Mixed drinks are great, Ive tried a couple and im not a mixed drink kinda guy. but ill do it here. I don't know why manzettis (if that's how you spell it) didn't make it. the layout of this place is perfect in my book.  Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. if they tell you its good it is."}
{"text":"Super close to where I worked so I went frequently and can say the service was never poor and the food was awesome on point! The Queso is delicious!"}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good. I would go back if others were suggesting it but probably not a choice I'd make on my own. I enjoyed the food and atmosphere, but think there are better Tex-Mex options in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience at Paco's Tacos last night.   Had a group of 10-12 people we were planning on, was able to call in and make a reservation with no problem, even though some of our party wasn't going to be there until after our reservation time.  Waiter and helpers were fantastic.  Did a great job explaining the different drinks and different menu items that were new to us.  The appetizers are pretty good, especially the unholy guacamole.  The bottlecaps/pickle chips appetizer was ok, however I was disappointed by the amount of fried jalapenos we got, they were hard to find and the dish was mostly fried pickles.  Entrees were great.  I got the Paco's Taco (brisket) and BBQ Shrimp.  Others were raving about the Gringo taco, Enchiladas, Skirt steak and Chicken.  No one was unhappy with their food.  Drinks were inventive, including the mango infused vodka drink with ginger beer.  You also can't beat a 20 oz. draft of Shiner for $5, at least not at a restaurant.  Overall was a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm not from Charlotte, so when looking for Tex Mex, a friend highly recommended Paco's. I've been there three times and have always had an excellent experience. It has a good clientele, great food, great drinks and great prices. It also has a warm, pleasant atmosphere. I can't wait to get back down to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty badly overrated.  I like it fine, and the size of the tacos is pretty great, but I don;t think it is the greatest and I would be perfectly fine not going there again.  Better than last time, however."}
{"text":"I enjoy Paco's Tacos & Tequila when I need to get my Tex Mex fix in Southpark.  I can't get enough of their salsas and chips.  I am also salivatingly into their beef brisket tacos.  They are a must-get.  I had an interesting cocktail called firestarter or firebreather or something.  Its primary ingredient is jalepeno infused tequila.  It was pretty cool.  It astounds me that a drink has been created that is spicy and sour at the same time.  I don't know how good it is for business though because it prompted me to sip slowly.  There was a 30 min or so wait on prime time Sat night, but service was good and price was reasonable.  2 brisket tacos with rice, beans and chipotle slaw for $10!"}
{"text":"This is a great tex mex place.. There food is always good and the service is great. Lots of tequilas to choose from and they have good Margarita specials as well. They are well know for the good tacos but this time I got the chicken chopped salad and it was great.. The portion was very large. I got a small and it was more then enough. We really like there white cheese queso.."}
{"text":"Tried it for restaurant week. I don't think they realize this is supposed to be Mexican and not BBQ. Queso has smoked ground beef as do the tacos. Pork carnitas ., same. Tortilla soup tastes like Campbell's vegetable soup in a can. The chicken was shredded bits and it's all veggies. No tortilla strips! We thought the food was just awful"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my husband and two kids because we happened to be in the area on a Friday late afternoon. The service and good were both amazing and the margaritas were top notch!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch.  I've been here a few times now.  I usually order a burrito, but I don't reallty like the sauce they put on top of them and I always feel so full and tired when I got back to work afterwards.    Yesterday, I went with fish tacos and they were really good!  Homemade tortilla which tastes great and the taco itself was delicious.  It comes with a side of rice and beans.  I got the black beans.  These were both meh.  It's a good place to go if you work in Southpark for lunch-they are really quick about getting you taken care of for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Affordable quality food. Bottomless chips and salsa! Great service! I could go on!"}
{"text":"First, to say that I'm passionate about anything that resembles Mexican/TexMex would be an understatement.  My first issue was the 10 minute wait, meanwhile, 25% of the tables were empty. Salsa was average, soup was uninspired and my meal (1 fish taco 1 skirt steak taco) was average at best.  If you live near Southpark and absolutely have to have Mexican, it might be worth a shot.  Otherwise, stick with Cabo or Loco Lime."}
{"text":"Pacos's has the best tacos in Charlotte, hands down. The Paco's taco is definitely my favorite on the menu but the gringo beef is another, more traditional option that is also fantastic. Do yourself a favor and order some guacamole before dinner, they make it right in front of you and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"We had a reservation made one month in advance, called to confirm day of as it was a larger party. When we arrived there was a party taking the only larger table and we had to wait 1/2 hour before sitting.  Once the bill came, it cost $210 for 3 pitchers of margaritas, what??? Should have ordered 3 amazing bottles of wine anywhere else for that price. Heads up management, pitchers traditionally are what you order to save money! My food was decent (shrimp tacos) but other people complained about dry beef etc. Disappointing to make a reservation for no reason, inexcusable!!"}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant several times now so it certainly has that \"IT\" factor that keeps ya coming back for more.  I typically come in the evening times so its usually fairly busy but never to where my date & I have to wait to be seated. In face we've managed to get the same exact booth on every single visit (what are the odds of that LoL) The staff is really good about letting you know what drink specials are offered as well as food to recommend. My date has always been a huge fan of the \"unholy guacamole\" (and now i'm a fan too) which is freshly prepared right at the table side to make sure it's just like you want it. The classic margarita is solid but the grapefruit version wasn't all that tasty (or was just mixed poorly) so drinks maybe hit or miss there. The main course usually does not disappoint, I have been experimenting with various tacos, the traditional seems to go better with the hard shell, but the soft shell works better with the more exotic choices on the menu. The meals are filling and haven't been able to muster up room for desert but they do make sure to offer it to you if you desire it. The atmosphere is pretty lively, they have a patio area if you choose to dine outdoors and there are also plenty TV's locked in on sports if you want to catch a game. I'm looking forward to hanging out here Cinco De Mayo or really anything you are in the mood for a good mexican dish, I would make my way over Paco's pronto!"}
{"text":"Great food. We got in late to our hotel from our flight and were looking for a place to eat. Friendly staff and they were more than accommodating to my wife's allergy. Recommended if you're visiting Charlotte. Minor nit - they may want to consider some wall hangings or white noise to dampen the background noise."}
{"text":"if you like tequila then go here. what a great selection!   chips great. salsa  really nice. tomatillo sauce outstanding. the very best tortilla soup I have ever had. delish.  fish tacos were really good.  good feel in the restaurant and the servers / bartenders were extremely friendly and helpful. check it out."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and we found us our New Mexican spot! Tasty as all hell and super neat interior! Service was excellent"}
{"text":"Service when you sit down at bat should not take 10 plus minutes to order.  Hire more help."}
{"text":"Best margaritas in town!  Food is affordable & very delicious! Best chicken tacos I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This right here is some goooooood tex-mex food. Probably my favorite in Charlotte. Who am I kidding, definitely my favorite in Charlotte. They have a very small outdoor patio (3 or 4 tables). There is literally always a wait here so come early or plan ahead with a reservation. Food has tons of flavor and is prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for my wife's birthday and we were glad we did. The wait on a Thursday night was 45 minutes. Also, it should be said that their salsa tastes like straight hot cilantro. So if you're not a cilantro fan - stay away. We ordered the large queso ($8) - it tasted like the stuff that we get it of the plastic bowl from Harris Teeter. I ordered the quesadilla and it was okay - small and the chicken lacked flavor. My wife ordered the tacos and the carnitas were dry. Our service was sub-par especially when we sent our tacos back and the server kept asking us if \"everything was good\" - we basically will not be going back to Paco's again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with work for the first time last week. The place was packed and the inside looked pretty fun, so I was expecting everything to be amazing.  Nothing here was bad, just lackluster.   In the restaurant's defense, I ordered a salad... which I guess is pretty boring most places, but I think it's a restaurant's time to shine. Anyway, I ordered the Chopped Salad, which is vegetarian EXCEPT for the dressing. So I substituted the Chipolte Bacon Ranch for the Honey Cilantro Lime dressing. Otherwise the salad was good, just boring and VERY skimpy on the toppings.  Highlight of my experience? The chips and salsa were good!   Even though the place was slammed, we did have really great, quick service. Well, except for my friend asked for no sour cream on his salad and it was there anyway.. but that's a kitchen problem I suppose.  I would be willing to try Paco's again, but can't say I'm terribly thrilled to do so at this point."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this for almost a year, since I first heard of it. It good good ratings and reviews. So instead of Cheesecake factory I convinced my wife to go here instead. Wish I hadn't! Only thing good was chips and salsa served before the meal. If you like bland, tasteless, flavor deficient, Americanized Mexican food you'll probably like this food. I however can count at least 5 maybe 6 Mexican food restaurants around Charlotte better than this place. (Verde, Vida, El Paraiso, Que Onda, Pio Pio, On The Border) Besides the flavor deficient food, the furnishings were old and dirty, whole place needs a good cleaning. Waitress didn't listen to my order very well, and brought me something I didn't order. So that was a wasted $50. Never again will they get my money. I was sadly disappointed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place. I'm quite picky when it comes to Mexican food. I lived in Mexico for a while. However, this is by far the best in my opinion. Price isn't bad either!"}
{"text":"Love this one!  The guac is sooo good!  I'm also a fan of the chicken fajita soup!  The service and food is always consistently good!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp.  In a nice little very clean shopping area (the restaurant was packed but they text you when a table is ready so having the nice shopping area to walk around helps).  We took one lap around, went back in and found a seat right at the bar so we were able to cancel the \"reservation\".  The guac is made tableside and is a must.  All the typical ingredients including 2 avocados.  Almost a meal by itself.  My wife and I split three tacos (fish, pulled pork and I cant remember).  All were excellent.  Margaritas, the defining item at a Mexican restaurant were really good!!  We had both with and without the house made mixture.  Not too sweet or sour or acidic.  Very nice!!!  While we were staying at a close by hotel, this place is worth a side trip."}
{"text":"We used to like going to this place. With the gluten friendly options it was a pretty decent place to eat (aside from the fact they can't seem to find a way to season ground beef without wheat - yet other restaurants do it all the time). However last month we stopped in for dinner and I got the Turkey Club carnita taco (along with the Al pastor taco). The Turkey club taco contains shredded turkey which one would think is safer than eating something like fish that might contain random inedible objects. However I unfortunately chomped down on a rather large piece of BONE after I had eaten 3/4 of the taco. Luckily I didn't swallow it but it didn't feel good on my teeth! I put it on my plate because at first I had no idea what it was. The waitress came by and I showed it to her. She apologized and asked me if I wanted them to make me another taco. Well no - if there are bones in this one, what about others? Plus I had pretty much lost my appetite. So she took my plate away and a few minutes later the manager came by. He explained how the bone possibly could have gotten in there and apologized but didn't even attempt to offer anything to me. No drink, dessert, nothing. So we thought no biggie - most places won't charge you for something like that happening. When the bill came, we noted there was no discount on my meal (I had a BONE in my food people). I've had other restaurants surprisingly give discounts when food came out wrong/late! Now I'm not a person wanting to find fault in restaurants and get stuff for free or discounted but a bone in someone's food that I could have easily swallowed is a big deal to me. So we just paid the bill and left. The next day my fiance called to speak with the corporate office about the issue (since obviously the manager at the restaurant wasn't concerned). He left a message the first time he called. After several days, there was no response so he called again. He spoke with the receptionist who took his name/number and indicated he would get a call back immediately. It's been over 6 weeks and no one ever returned his call. Pretty pathetic customer service and the food isn't that great. We'll never go to Pacos again."}
{"text":"Restaurant located in a mall, next door to hotel...let's just say I had my doubts walking in, but I was pleasantly surprised. The soft tacos were delicious, the atmosphere was good and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Salsa is not good - sorry!! I'm from Texas and the salsa just tastes like lime juice.  Got the chopped salad and added chicken - super great salad!! The tortilla soup is solid also."}
{"text":"How this place doesn't have 5 stars is beyond me. It does get crowded, so make reservations. The volcano queso is to die for. And they have the best tacos in Charlotte. The margaritas are on the sweeter side but still fantastic. Def one of my favorite spots in the QC."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and love this place. I had lunch here today and it was amazing. The chips are thin and warm and the service is great! I had the turkey taco with rice and beans (one for $7 and it's HUGE) don't let a turkey, lettuce, avocado, and tomato taco fool you, this was absolutely incredible. By far my favorite. Idk how they cook the turkey but it tastes almost like a really good pork belly (minus the fat) and has a really great taste and texture. The guacamole is always delicious and made table side. The quality of food you get here for the price can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out after reading the reviews on here. Unfortunate location though---across from South Park Mall but with the entrance facing the Marriott.  We went here on a Saturday afternoon and there were a few other patrons there (mostly with kids, it seems like a good place to bring them) and we were promptly greeted by the server. I was confused by the theme of it though. It has a menu full of Mexican food, the decor seemed more Western Route 66 -ish and the music was random as well. Being one that loves random stuff, I enjoyed it. Service was great and the manager even stopped by after to see how everything was and how we thought everything tasted and if it needed any more flavor or seasoning. I thought that was really awesome that they asked our opinion (even if they really didn't care). I got the ceviche why was served like a parfait in a dessert cup so I found that different but it tasted great as well did the chips and salsa.  Personally, prices seemed a little steep. $7 for one taco? No thanks, I can make one at home for $.80."}
{"text":"Becoming mediocre.  Went on a Friday, crowded as usual.  Food was lukewarm and margs were watered down.  Overall seems to be on downhill slide each time we go."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Quick service, and friendly staff.  I had the taco and salad combination,  that along with the complimentary chips and salsa was almost too much food.  The slightly smokey salsa is quite addictive.  Great food at a good price."}
{"text":"Excellent margarita, chips and salsa, but wouldn't go back for the food.  Our server, Ashely was great and the manager came by when she heard we were disappointed with the food and offered us something else.  As we weren't hungry we didn't take her up on her offer but appreciated that she came by.  It's very noisy in this restaurant, but if you're just looking for a drink and chips and salsa, go here.  We will return when we stay at the Marriott again, but will not order food."}
{"text":"I've only been in Charlotte a month. Paco's is my New Mexican restaurant of choice. Chips and salsa are great and tacos are the best"}
{"text":"Here's an update to my earlier review.   As stated before, I really WANT to like this place. However, I lunched there the other day and, sadly, have decided I'm done.   The chips and salsa are awesome and my toddler daughter was pleased with her chicken fingers. But my wife and I split the lunch chicken fajitas and they were, to say the least, the weirdest fajitas we've ever had.   I'm no Tex-Mex expert, but my experience with fajitas is that they're strips of chicken, onions, and peppers served sizzling on a cast-iron platter.  The vegetables are typically cooked just past the point of tenderness.  The fajitas brought to our table consisted of chunks of what appeared to be a small baked breast atop a pile of what appeared to be an overdone pepper/onion mash which was bitter to the taste.  The sides (guac, pico, cheese, lettuce) were excellent though.  I'm still a big fan of Frank's Cantina 1511 and Mama Ricotta's but not crazy about Big (Bad) Daddy's though or now, Paco's."}
{"text":"5 stars to the beverages, chips and dip!!   =)  2 stars for the food! =(     Beverages.. -Strawberry Rhubarb Margarita -Texas Mule  *Both were outstanding!!!  Food.. -Shrimp Tacos: my friend said they were not great, but not the worst.  -side of rice: the red kind, gross. It's like spicy tomato sauce on rice.  -white rice: more like the Mexican rice but still not great  -side of sauteed zucchini: burnt and very spicy"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Charlotte! The drinks are always awesome and so is the costumer service. Anytime we are near the Southpark area we always go here!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC Mexican food!!!  I had the chicken & steak fajitas - Yum!!!  Also we had the beef brisket tacos & kids chicken & cheese quesadillas.  Everything was great!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this Tex-Mex place out after reading positive reviews. The best items we had were the refried beans and chips & salsa. The salsa was richly flavored with enough heat to satisfy everyone at the table. The refried beans were delicious. Smooth and flavorful with melted cheese on top. We all had different tacos and they were fine. The margarita special that night tasted more like limeade but it was not their top shelf variety. Still on the lookout for a good Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy Guacamole Batman! Second time I've ate at Paco's and I must say, they live up to the great reviews and I'm not even a Mexican food kinda guy, but sweet fancy moses they have great tacos. Not like your ordinary cheap tacos - these are well made with great ingredients. Always...I mean ALWAYS order the Unholy Guacamole - they make it in front of your and it is delisioso...I believe that is Spanish for tasty. The girls digg the margaritas too and I'll always toss back a Corona while I'm at it. Gracious once again Paco."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. There was a wait for a Thursday Night since they had $10 top-self margaritas, but we ended up getting seated within five minutes. The food was very good and filling! You get chips upon arrival to the table. Our food came out hot and faster thn excepted and the whole staff was attentive, constantly checking if need anything and getting us refills. The reason why I didn't give all stars because in our bowl we had an overload of beans, more rice or cabbage would have been great. I will like to come back and try their tacos."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try Pacos after much delay on my part getting there. For me it was just OK. Service was really good, which was a nice surprise. The food; however, was a separate surprise. Granted it could have been what I ordered too.   Ordered the enchiladas (can't remember the exact name) and there was so much cheese sauce/queso all over the dish that it was hard to gave a bite of anything, including the rice & beans, without eating cheese. Being from Wisconsin, I like me some cheese, but this was too much. Either way, I'll give it another shot because the location is great!"}
{"text":"We went to Paco's Tacos & Tequila this past Saturday night for a late dinner (around 9:00).  It was still pretty crowded, which is impressive considering there's very little signage leading you back to this new restaurant that sits hidden in the back of a parking lot.  I guess word-of-mouth does wonders!    We were impressed by the transformation from the former Manzetti's to Paco's.  The new decor added to Manzetti's dark wood was perfectly suited for a Tex-Mex place.    A friend of mine had been recently and recommended (since I like spicy food) the jalapeno margarita.  (I think it was called the \"Firestarter\" on the menu?)  I ordered it, and it was fantastic.  There were other jalapeno-infused beverages offered that sounded appealing, too.  Mind you, these are ONLY for people who are serious about spicy food; they're damn hot.  Be sure to order a glass of water as an accompaniment!  The chips and salsa they serve (free!) to start were fantastic.  The chips were very light -- both in weight and taste.  I didn't feel like I was truly stuffing myself with them (which was a good thing!).  There were two types of salsa served with it -- a sweet green tomatillo one and a red spicy one (possibly habanero?).  Both tasted incredibly fresh and flavorful.    As an additional app (because it was late, we were starving, and they sounded so good), we ordered the fried pickle chips and jalapenos.  It was the perfect combination for sharing between spicy food lovers and non-spicy food lovers.   I ordered two tacos for my entree -- a fish taco and a shrimp taco.  The fish was just okay. I think it's the coleslaw that ruins it for me; I'm not a fan of cabbage.  The BBQ shrimp taco was awesome, though.  I think next time I would order a quesadilla like my partner had, since I don't really need the rice and beans.  The quesadilla was huge, packed full, and came with fresh-made pico de gallo and guacamole (with chunks of avocado in it).      Would I recommend Paco's?  Heck yeah.  For many reasons.  It's a great casual dining experience, offers drinks and salsas that other Mexican restaurants don't, and it's fun for all."}
{"text":"Loved it!  The food was fantastic (tortilla chip encrusted fish was outstanding.)   The first time I had Paco's Tacos was catered at a birthday party.  I swore we'd make it to the restaurant SOON after I gobbled 3 plates of tacos, fajitas, salad, chips, guacamole...  Anyhow, FF a few months and we finally made it there.  I was worried it would be too much of a bar atmosphere for our little high chair patron, but was so excited to find it extremely kid friendly.  Crayons and other toys to distract the little ones....we were able to enjoy a wonderful meal of perfectly spiced guacamole, wood fired chicken (exquisite taste), and I love that they offer whole wheat tortillas.   Love the tomatillo salsa - and lots of Shiner beers on tap to choose from.  Fantastic!  DEFINITELY warrants a trip back!"}
{"text":"Bar staff was attentive although very busy. The tacos were creative, non-traditional, and yummy! Interesting tequila infusions. Cute spot tucked away in strip mall heaven by Southpark mall. Great patio!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing, bar is plentiful big! Tacos and black beans were phenomenal. Huge beer selection! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved every bit of being at this place. It is a little tucked away so you can't see it from the street but I am so glad we found it. While we were waiting for a table, my coworkers and I grabbed a drink at the bar and they brought their chips and salsa right out to us too. Now this isn't just the normal salsa you get at every other Mexican restaurant, this salsa had a kick to it and it was so good. When we got seated at a table and again the chips and salsa came right out with no hesitation. Our server came over and she was was very friendly and gave great recommendations. Starting off we ordered the volcano queso with no pineapples and it was absolutely delicious with chopped up bacon on top. I want that recipe haha Everything on the menu looked great but I ended up going for the chimichanga and my friends went for 3 tacos each. The food portions are outrageous and I love it. I wasn't able to finish my food but really wished I could. My friends also couldn't finish and could really only eat 2 tacos.  We saw on the menu brussel sprouts and bacon and we were sold, but unfortunately we weren't impressed at all. This is a dish that is best left simple. We would suggest not shredding the brussel sprouts and maybe keeping them whole or cutting them in half. It turned more so like a slaw with the shredding and the tomatoes and we wished it wasn't.  Overall, this place is amazing! I would suggest it to everyone. Though we didn't like the brussel sprouts, everything else was to die for and this place definitely deserves a 5."}
{"text":"This place has authentic food with a modern American theme. The salsa was on point and delicious. The smoked Jalapeño was good but not very spicy however everything is better with bacon so still worth it for an appetizer. The Paco's Taco was melt in your mouth tender but the Skirt Steak Taco was the star on my plate. The sides are strong but not outstanding black bean, slaw and rice are nice but again not outstanding but sides shouldn't steal the thunder anyhow. Staff was friendly and efficient without being over attentive. All in all a good experience it would have received 5 stars but as is common in Taco spots the temperature of the food was a bit on the chilly side."}
{"text":"I loved everything I had!   Chips & salsa had a fresh quality to them with a little kick.  I had two tacos... Huge!  After the first I didn't think the second could match it but it did!  Go to this place and you will get the feel that you discovered a gem and a go-to place!"}
{"text":"We had a great time at Paco's Tacos on Cinco De Mayo! Since I knew they would be really busy that night I made a reservation on Open Table so when we arrived our table was ready! Our server Aaron was awesome, friendly and attentive. It was really busy but he still took the time to make recommendations on food and tequila choices.  We all had tacos. The Paco's Taco was amazing and they have a huge tequila menu.   Fun, lively atmosphere.  The staff is great at making sure your needs are met. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere and food. Would definitely recommend and go again. They make the guacamole right in front of you, catering it's texture (chunky to creamy) to your desire."}
{"text":"I am from Los Angeles and we know real Mexican food and this is not Mexican food.  The refried beans are from a can, you can taste the preservatives.  If you like boxed Mexicans rice this is the place for you.  The service was amazing they truly give you the Noth Carolina hospitality smiles.  I came here because of the reviews and I am sure the regulars here might like it and think this is Mexican food but I compare this place to Chilis bar and Grill, if there is one here. It's the Taco Bell of Mexican food."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  Tacos that make you moan or is it the purity of their margaritas? No fake stuff here!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were the best part of the meal. And they kept filling the basket of chips! Had the shrimp and grilled fish tacos that were ok. The fried shrimp taco was a little too salty for my taste.   It's your average Mexican food restaurant that serves the usual standards. I was hoping for something on the menu that would set them apart, but found nothing."}
{"text":"Paco's Tacos and Tequila was a nice time because of the choices of TK, atmosphere and service which were all very good.  Where it fell short was in the appetizer size for the money - I enjoy chicken nachos that are stacked high since tortillas are so inexpensive and taste great!  Paco's was good tasting but the chips were a single layer of chips smothered soggy by the chicken/cheese topping.  rate 2.5 The main meal was good but what I want to mention is the \"fried\" ice cream which another customer had about the same comments regarding the coating and presentation.  I could not tell what the coating was made of and there was adequate ice cream to share but it was soft and did not seem crispy.  served on a plate rather than in a cinnamon/sugared tortilla shell it was not what was expected.  It was eaten because I wanted to taste it and figure out what the coating was...rated 1.5 Would I return - maybe for the margaritas and chips and salsa - however, consider a TK klub and punch a card for each different tk tried and award a food item, tshirt, or discount for a meal, or something to encourage patron ship.  Will I give the food a second chance...maybe but they need to reconsider the fried ice cream..."}
{"text":"Up and down experience. Salsa was very salty. Asked for replacement. Same. Must have been bad batch. Table side guacamole was good. Asked for spicy but no kick. I blame the jalapeños. Sometimes they are mild. Good flavor however. Asked bartender best tacos. Al Pastor. Very average and bland. Usually very flavorful at other places. Did not finish."}
{"text":"I'm always up for trying a new Mexican place!   For me the food is just okay, but the drinks are the real winner. We started with the guacamole and it was chunky and fresh. I loved it. The salsa here is not for me. I think the flavors and consistency are a bit off.   Whatever you do...order a margarita. They do them right here. I ordered the Rusty El Camino and it was perfect! Just the right amount of liquor with blood orange puree...gimme another please!   For my meal, I ordered the two tacos - one shrimp and one fish. Both were okay. Meh, I didn't like one more than the other. I hate the rice and slaw but the charro beans were pretty tasty. I could have done without all the sides and just tried another taco.   Either way, it's a good place to grab a margarita and some guac."}
{"text":"Good food. Love the outdoor seating options and appreciate the strong margaritas. Just make sure you have time to wait as there's normally a wait on the weekend."}
{"text":"We are not sure which was better the service or the food- both were fantastic! Our server treated us with the highest level of service that we have had in quite some time, I believe CJ was his name. The tacos had amazing flavor and the menu prices were affordable and a good value for the price."}
{"text":"I'd classify this place as 'solid.'   Not necessarily something I'd go out of my way for.  But,  if you're in South Park already, it's better than settling for Cheesecake Factory.  In an area of town inundated with national chains, this place feels more organic.  Also - You can get intoxicated off of the margaritas, which is a plus."}
{"text":"My husband had a meeting for work in Charlotte. I decided to tag a long and while searching for a place to have dinner, we realized Pacos Tacos was walking distance for us from the Marriott. Not knowing what to anticipate... Our expectations were met for sure. Great food, wonderful drinks and a fun atmosphere. We would highly recommend this restaurant as a date night or for families. Also would recommend the cucumber jalapeño margarita! Cheers"}
{"text":"Paco's is a nice place to hang out and have some decent American style Tex-Mex in a convenient location. Nice atmosphere and you can certainly tell this is a Cantina sibling. For authentic food go to Tacqueria Mexico...."}
{"text":"Walked by here the previous day and the place was packed with a line out the door. We figured it must be good. I made a reservation for the next day, we arrived and had to wait for a few minutes while they cleared the table. Had great seats by the window. Then the wait came. We received a glass of water and then waited. We seen the server buzzing around but evidently we were invisible. Finally she came by and I wanted a margarita. Went for strawberry on the rocks. It was very sweet and hard to explain the taste. Not very good but drinkable. I went for loaded steak tacos. Ok this made up for other things. They were very good and all the toppings were fresh. The guacamole was very good. Service did improve but the evening could have been better."}
{"text":"Great Tex mex spot in Southpark! I came here after work and sat at the bar. I was offered chips and salsa right away but politely declined (I can eat baskets of chips). The bartender gave me a menu and took my drink order. I opted for the fiesta bowl with grilled shrimp. The fiesta bowl is basically a deconstructed burrito - very similar to the fast casual competition. It was very tasty and the avocado that accompanies the bowl was firm but still ripe - delicious.  The crunch of the cabbage accompanied well with the black beans, three blend cheese, and rice. The shrimp was seasoned well and grilled perfectly."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I went for the tequila selection and did not feed, but when it comes to their tequila selection and quality, I would definitely put them at or near the top of the list of area establishments.  Next time I'll try the food...I hear that their fish tacos are great!"}
{"text":"Best Tex Mex place in Charlotte!  A horrible experience at another similar restaurant made me realize how amazing this place is. Food is delicious, especially the tacos. They have great drink specials too. You will not regret coming here.   Enjoy it, I know I always do!"}
{"text":"This restaurant claims to be accessible but that's a lie (around 75% of the seating here is on a sunken level). My husband and I tried to eat here this afternoon but ended up leaving due to the restaurant's disinterest in seating us. My husband has recently had foot surgery and is using a knee scooter since he can't bear any weight on his foot. When we arrived at the hostess station and the hostess saw my husband she excused herself and went to talk to someone else who was maybe a manager. Whoever this person was, he never came over but sent her back to ask us if my husband could navigate the stairs...he's using a knee scooter, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the answer to that one. When we said no she said we could sit outside. It was either \"navigate the stairs\" or sit outside. All this while we're staring at about 8 empty regular tables and a couple empty high top tables on the level we're on. When we declined to sit outside and said we'd go elsewhere, the hostess just said oh, ok, sorry. The person (manager) she went to talk to was standing several feet away watching this whole exchange and never once came over to offer to seat us on the ground level when it was clear we were leaving.   TLDR; Go to Chuy's!! They genuinely care about their customers and their food is much better as they serve actual Tex-Mex."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for Valentine's Day because there is truly nothing better than Mexican food. We had great service and delicious margaritas (I had the cucumber jalapeño, while my boyfriend had the fire starter). We indulged in the delicious (free!) chips and salsa and then had our meal! I ordered the veggie fajitas and they were incredible, and such a large portion for $11. My boyfriend had a combo - just $15 for 1 enchilada, 1 quesadilla and 1 taco. I already can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"So we decided to venture out of our box and decide to give Paco's Tacos a try. We are very loyal to a certain Mexican joint in Indian Trail and we never cheat on them. However we had been given a gift card to Paco's Tacos and we couldn't allow it to go to waste. We showed up on a Saturday night at 7:30 and had to wait about 20 minutes. Not bad for a Saturday. The place was crowded and loud but the chips an salsa eased my pain. They were very tasty, almost to tasty if you know what I mean. The only disappointment was the Salsa was a bit to hot for my 2 little ones and they didn't have anything milder. Bummer for my kids and bummer for me because I had to listen to them complain.   On the recommendation of our waiter, who looked like Dale Earnhardt JR. BTW, we should mix and match the tacos. I had the fried Fish Taco and the Beef Brisket Taco. The fried fish was very good, light , crispy and well seasoned. It gets an A+ in my book. The Beef Brisket was pretty bad. It tasted like Pot Roast. Even my Husband agreed with me and that NEVER happens. The taco had no Mexican flavors whatsoever unfortunately. It truly tasted like a bland Pot Roast. With the Tacos came rice (I've had better) and these beans that were called Churro Beans. OMG, they were very DELISH!!!! Pinto Beans with raw onion, bacon and some wonderful Latin spices. I could have eaten a HUGE bowl of them and left very happy. My Husband had the Calamari taco and the Shrimp taco. Both were good. I will probably stick with the Fish Tacos in the future.   All in all ,Pacos Tacos is OK not great, IMO. I will most likely give it another try. Maybe for lunch next time around."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Paco's.  Great food, great service - we have more fun each time we visit!"}
{"text":"Yummy fresh made guacamole and several margarita options. The tacos are small and tasty. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Paco's Tacos immediately became my 'go-to' place for Mexican food after just one visit.   To start out, do yourself a favor and order the volcano queso --- bacon, pineapple, jalapenos all buried inside the cheesy goodness. They serve it with warm tortilla shells so you can switch it up from just plain ole chips.  I've only ever ordered the tacos, and the best go-tos are the Paco's Taco (braised beef brisket FTW) & the Shake Down Shrimp. The Turkey Club & Chicken Milanesa are also good options, but  not nearly as good as my first two recommendations.   Their margs are delicious, albeit a little pricey.   PS - this place fills up fast and is notorious for 1+ hr waits."}
{"text":"We fled Hurricane Irma and found ourselves having lunch at this outstanding Mexican restaurant.  What a delightful surprise!  This was bar none the best Tex Mex we have ever had.  The chips and salsa were our first clue as to just how good this was to be.  Then the guacamole was off the charts.  I had the enchiladas Dennis with grilled corn and Nancy had the chicken tortilla soup/chopped salad combo.  Never have we enjoyed Mexican cuisine this much.  Add their wonderful service and this was a 10 Star experience!  Thank you, Irma...."}
{"text":"One of the best handcrafted cocktail menus in Charlotte. Good quality food. Fun atmosphere. Usually a short wait."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and Delicious food. Would definitely recommend if you're in the mood for tacos."}
{"text":"Maybe just a bad night. Was quoted 45 minutes and waited 70. No bueno. Better to give more of an estimate and allow patrons to be relieved if shorter time. Kitchen's timing was off because 2 of our entrees were cold. No fault of our server, Nimit, who was honest and personable. Shouts out to him. Chips and salsa were consistent. Will not be in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are delicious. I'd return just for those. They have a wide selection of tacos and its nice to mix and match. Solid fare. Good service."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat. Staff is always good and the tacos are creative and delicious. I love the nacho and chicken appetizer and the 3 taco meal. This review us actually making me hungry!"}
{"text":"David and I finally tried Paco's and I was really excited about checking it out. It was a-ok but didn't knock my socks off.   I am not sure why I expected it to be a lot different from Cantina 1511, but on my visit, I didn't see a huge difference.    In fact, I ended up getting the enchiladas de denis which I also order at Cantina. This comes served with red rice and your choice of beans - which for me is always black beans.  It was good, but nothing I haven't had before.   If I lived in the neighborhood, this would probably be a place I would come to more often, but since we have a Cantina 1511 in the 28277 area, we'll probably stick to that instead."}
{"text":"First time here. Bring a friend, bring an appetite and bring home lunch for tomorrow! I had the chi ken fajitas and it was a lot of food for one person. Great price/value for what you get. Chicken was grilled, but lacked \"authentic\" marinated flavor. Still very good. The borracho beans were spot on! The tortillas, I doubt are made from scratch on premise as they seemed too formed and thick like pita bread. Just an opinion - again, good.  Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"One needs to understand that this is a jumping restaurant with a young clientele; the ambience is okay - lively and cute - but we would not choose this restaurant for its ambience as we prefer a bit more upscale environment.  With that said, the food is really excellent.  Everything is made from scratch.  Everything including the chips (homemade), salsa, cocktails, guacamole, salad (we had the chopped and a split portion was still gigantic) and tacos (the smoked brisket ones were fabulous) was excellent.  Great flavors.  It happens to also be very reasonable for the quality and wonderful service that they provide.  We have a lot of appreciation for the amount of labor that goes into this kind of food."}
{"text":"Good place for margaritas and tacos. rest of the food taste was ok."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on Sunday and was blown away. Everything was amazing! Chips and salsa were the best I have ever had. Salsa was very fresh with the perfect amount of spice. The chips were light, not greasy and deliciously salty. We also ordered the chunky guacamole which was also perfect!  I got the garden enchiladas which were topped with a tasty green sauce that I highly recommend. The fiancé got a duo of shrimp tacos, one fried, one grilled. Both were good, but as with most things, the fried was unbeatable.   This place makes pretty much everything in house including tortillas, chips and salsa, etc, and you can definitely taste the difference!  The service as awesome too! And so was my bloody Maria which was only $5 since it was Sunday.   We went 3 days ago and I am still amazed by how delicious the food was."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count and it's so consistently good every single visit. Paco's is ALWAYS packed, so make sure you have a reservation or plan on waiting. Seriously, I've never seen a more consistently busy restaurant. My go-to order is the chicken fajitas. The portion is huge and I can never finish everything despite my best efforts. My fiancé raves about the tacos here. I recommend two tacos for a normal meal or three if you are very hungry. The tacos are stuffed, unlike some places who skimp on the fillings. A coworker from Texas agrees, this place is the real deal. Paco's Tacos is the best Tex-mex in the QC."}
{"text":"Go here for lunch from time to time and the only thing I will get are the salads. They come with fresh lettuce (not brown). I tried the tacos when I first came here and I wasn't a fan. Too greasy and over filled with everything but protein. Can't go wrong with the salads. Very plentiful."}
{"text":"This visit brought 9 of us in for dinner, thankfully with reservations!  Jordana was a wonderful waitress, very attentive & knowledgeable about the menu & tequila.  Tortilla chips - Warm & lightly salted, with not ONE, but TWO salsas! The staple red salsa & my favorite: the verde / tomatillo. Again, Jordana kept the chip bowls filled.  My kitty margarita had just the right amount of tequila & \"bite\" to it & was in a reasonably sized glass.  I decided to go with the shake down shrimp taco & gringo beef taco. I'm not a big fan of beans or rice, so thankfully Jordana said I could substitute other sides. I went with the BBQ buttered corn & a double helping of the chipotle citrus slaw.  Shake down shrimp taco - lightly breaded & seasoned nicely. The shredded cabbage made a nice compliment, as did the pico de gallo.  Due to my overloading on chips, I was unable to finish the beef taco or corn. I took this home to the boyfriend & he loved both. :)  Dion L. - resident foodie! :) also wanted us all to try the chimichanga, which was AMAZING! Luckily, 4 of us shared bites of it. It was full of flavor. Dion & I commented that it tasted like something yummy from the fair.  The atmosphere was cozy & warm, it didn't necessarily have a \"theme\" that I could tell, although their were a lot of warm tones of brown & amber. The music was rather interesting...jumping from rock to country every other song. :D  Overall, I'm pleased with my trip to Paco's."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try out another of Frank Scibelli's concepts. I've been a longterm fan of Bad Daddy's and Midwood Smokehouse. I had heard good things about the tortillas and their specials. Glad we finally got this concept in the books!   Tucked behind the Williams Sonoma on Morrison, it's a secluded location that comes alive for a BIG dinner crowd. Plenty of parking in the lot and other lots surrounding the shopping center.   Our visit was for dinner recently. We had tried other nights but the way can be rather overwhelming. We made it in for an 8pm dinner.   Service was great. Seated quickly, given a good rundown of the menu and recommended a few margaritas for us to try. We obliged and tried the original marg and a mango-infused marg. Sad to say, I was rather unimpressed with the mix. I'm not much of a margaritas goer, but the balance was wrong and seemed to be thrown together rather fast without much consideration for taste. I was a little disappointed since it was a bit of a slower night in the dining room(s) and the bar. On to the meal...  Chips are great. Light, lightly salted and served with an array of salsas. The standard red salsa has a twinge of heat and an smoke to the flavor. The tomatillo is freaking great. Uhh...I think I put it on everything but my margarita. Definitely worth the tomatillo alone.   Entrees: My wife, as many know, is a vegetarian. The menu actually reads \"Ask about our vegetarian options.\" Sadly, there aren't actual \"options.\" Our server pointed to a few regular items that can be made sans meat. She ordered the Gringo Nachos. The only options listed on the menu are chicken, ground beef or brisket. Her order only came with the standard veggies. Rather underwhelming and definitely screaming for some more cheese.   I ordered the standard Paco's Tacos. An order of two that comes with rice and beans. The rice was pretty standard and a welcome accompaniment to my tacos. The beans, however, are a \"charro\" style recipe. Can't say that I'm a fan. Very burnt flavor and lacking in welcoming texture. With a generous helping of the tomatillo salsa, they were in the clear! The tacos were GREAT. Love the tortillas. Made in-house, and boy does it show. Warm, chewy and perfect floury taste. I could 5 with just the tomatillo salsa. The brisket is worth a try. Never had it on tacos before, but I would definitely order it again. Seasoned well and paired nicely with the other taco accouterment.   Price is rather fair. No complaints in that department.   I'd say there are a few things that could have been done a bit better, but we'll definitely be back to try some other options. Looking forward to those warm tortillas again soon! Thanks, Frank Scibelli for another option in the Queen City!"}
{"text":"Hands down! They have the best salsa in town.  Right amount of heat and a hint of smoke.  Usually have a good meal; brisket is tops but their slaw is bland and lacking any flavors. Just a hint if cilantro and dry.  Good sangria too!"}
{"text":"Went here with some co workers. Service was great, margaritas came out super fast.  We tried all 9 of the margaritas including the house special.  We had the fresh guacamole and chips (ate way to much salsa and guac).  We all did 2 tacos, slaw, refried beans with various taco wraps (I had soft corn, one guy had hard shells, other one did soft flour)  Very filling!  Would definitely go back to try other food items.  Probably wouldn't order the guacamole again since we couldn't stop eating it ha.  Need to save some space for the other food items."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite tex-mex locations in Charlotte. The drinks are fantastic and the food is very good. If you try to go there on a Friday or Saturday night, be careful because the line can get long. There is plenty of places to walk around close by."}
{"text":"I really love this place!  The food is fantastic and fresh, and the service has been superior every time I've been there - which is about half a dozen times since moving to Charlotte in October 2014.  I was tempted to give it 5 stars - and refrained ONLY because the back room could use a little sprucing up, and the AC is down too low and the dining area can feel VERY cold. So....bring a sweater (or sit outside!) and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love their salsa! I always say i'm going to try something different but I very rarely do because I love their tacos so much.the signature Paco's Taco is amazing and when doing the combo, you never finish the whole thing but yay for leftovers!.  table side Guac -- you know it's fresh. you never run out of chips! I do have to say my favorite Margarita out of the ones they have as their signature cocktails is the Rusty El Camino.   i love the smoked Jalapenos, yes it's spicy but i'm used to it being half puerto rican. Its fun to watch my boyfriend eat them and after 3 bites, there is sweat dripping down his face! He's a good sport though. But how can you resist anything wrapped in bacon!  We go there a lot. It's a lot of food for a decent price..... best part... lunch the next day or if it's friday or saturday, try putting the leftovers in an omelet! So good!   AND MOST OF ALL FOR ME-- A GLUTEN FREE MENU as I have Celiac disease. everything for me is on a corn tortilla!"}
{"text":"Food and salsa was great everything was cooked to perfection. One of the better Tex-Mex style restaurants I had in a long time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch and was a great experience! We were seated right away and our waiter, Matthew, came over seconds later with chips & salsa and to take our drink order. Chips were warm and fresh and salsa was delicious with a nice kick. I ordered the no name margarita which was quite yummy. They have a huge tequila offering and margarita specials every day.   I ordered one paco taco (beef brisket) and one chicken taco. They were both amazing and served quickly. Meat was very fresh and flavorful. Tacos come with beans, rice, and coleslaw on the side. The service was really attentive and definitely made the experience. Constant water refills and more chips & salsa before we even ran out. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for dinner and OMG seriously one of my new favorite places to eat at.  The salsa, the queso, and best of all the guacamole (made fresh by your table as you order) are a must have!  Definitely try the tacos, can't decide which one's you want, you can pick 2 or 3!  It's awesome!  Tried the fish tacos and the Paco's Taco (beef brisket taco) and they were amazing!  Our waiter Tucker was awesome!  Will definitely come here again and try their margaritas!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here regularly, but most recently we had a life changing experience at Paco's.  We recently had a child and while that seems like a useless piece of information, it is, until it isnt.  You see, we had yet another sleep-deprived night last night (as all good parents do) and our beautiful demon baby couldn't stop screeching all morning. It's a Saturday morning, so what do we normally do? Oh Home Depot, Bed Bath and Beyond, we'll see. Might get a little crazy. Well, after we called our parents and both sets of them laughed at us, they gave us some of the best parental advice that's been passed down from generation to generation... drive her around!   So we did.  Plopped our little porkchop into her tank of a car seat (have you seen these things recently? That's why mom's in south Charlotte don't need to hit the gym. Doing curls with a 25# car seat will give you guns to rival Arnold) and off went.  Magically, it worked!  After cruising the mean streets of South Charlotte for an hour, we realized that we broke the cardinal rule of new parenting: don't forget to eat and drink plenty of water. My wife realized she didn't eat for the last 3 meals!  What are we to do? I flipped up the Yelp app (product placement) and we decided to stuff our faces with South Park's finest Mexican, Pacos Tacos.   We were nervous we were going to be the only ones there at 11:05AM, looking completely haggard from a tough night.   The good news?   That's where all new parents go for the \"early bird special\".   We were even more nervous that our hellion was going to lose it and we were going to be \"those parents\". You know, the ones who let their kid wail in the middle of church because they couldn't properly manage their kid's blood sugar?   Well Pacos had us covered there too. The dull roar of the kitchen and Willie Nelson's soothing tunes kept our daughter quiet during our entire meal. (Yes, the ENTIRE meal)  Bless you Paco, you saved the day.  You know what else is great?  Getting the first food served of the day.  My wife's fajitas were perfect.   The unholy guacamole, lived up to it's name.   My steak quesadilla, burrito, two tacos, and enchiladas?   Hot, delicious, and made with love. (So what, I'm a stress eater... want to fight about it?)   Later that day, we all made it home safely, our daughter slept for another hour and my wife and I, well we got the best hour nap of our week.  Thank you Pacos, we are customers for life!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST Mexican Spots in Charlotte Area....  I'll jump right into the salsa of the matter here - the food was great, the service was great, the ambiance was great, the prices were very reasonable...  Food:  I ordered the giant monster, burrito, which came stuffed with caramelized onions, bell peppers and red rice, I ordered a mix of chicken and steak as I wanted to sample both of the meats.  The waitress was more than happy to accommodate me in this request.  My date ordered the steak quesadillias.  Both of our entrees were delectable and were served to perfection.  I couldn't imagine what more anyone could want from a giant, monster burrito.  It was loaded with meats, both tender and succulent.  In addition the burrito was accompanied with a scoop of sour cream, pico, and guacamole (at my request) and rice.  My date loved the taste her quesadillas and explained that the skirt steak was juicy and tender. -We ordered the Coastal Calamari as an appetizer.  It too was amazing.  As a calamari lover, there is nothing worse than tough, overcooked calamari.  SO you can imagine my elation when we received a big plate of warm, tender and not overcooked, calamari!  It included two different types of dipping sauce, a red based marinara-type sauce and another white, \"mystery sauce\" which was also quite tasty.   -The chips and salsa are on par with crack in their addictive powers.  The chips are perfect, served warm, fresh and with a dab of salt.  The salsa is also excellent and taste fresh.  The best part is that they bring you as much of each, as you want.    Service:  Our service was excellent.  I could not have asked for more as far as friendliness and promptness.  When we needed water refilled, they were.  When we needed more chips and salsa, it was there.  When we needed our entrees after a five minute wait, they were there.    Prices:  The prices were very reasonable, $38.69, but I was able to use my City pass coupon and save $10 (see pics).  Not bad for two adults and that includes a Dos XX Amber and an appetizer.    I don't know if Paco's is actually the NUMBER ONE Mexican spot in Charlotte, but it is certainly in the conversation and one would be remiss not to consider Paco's Tacos and Tequila when looking for good Mexican in the Charlotte area.    I'll leave you with two statements:  1. This place is waaaaay better than the new La Paz at the Met.  2. I'll be back here soon."}
{"text":"Paco's Tacos was a great experience. I had the Fiesta Bowl and I loved it. The service was awesome and the atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my trip to Paco's Tacos & Tequila, but everything I ate was just solidly good.  It's about a 40 minute drive from my house, so unless it was a place that friends were wanting to meet, I wouldn't go out of my way to dine there.  If I could have given a 3.5, I would have.  I ordered Paco's Taco which came with Spanish rice, slaw, and a choice of beans.  The taco itself was good and the first bite made me go, \"Wow!\" but apparently all of the sauce in my taco was in that one bite.  After that, it sort of fell flat for me.  The rice was okay, but the slaw was pretty dry -- like just shredded cabbage.  I didn't taste the citrus or the chipotle in it.  The side of Charro Beans was the most flavorful thing on my plate -- and I did enjoy them.  The salsa at Paco's is also really good -- perhaps the rest of my meal just suffered by comparison.  We did receive good service from Henny!"}
{"text":"Just a great place to get lunch or dinner. I usually get the crispy Tacos and there are daily drink specials. Bloody Maria on Sunday. This is a restaurant you can feel very comfortable when eating alone"}
{"text":"Gosh yelp really fooled me on this one. I saw the reviews thought this place would be good and it was not close to good at all. I was so disappointed. We had the chicken and steak fajitas. The veggies underneath the protein was mushy and old. Felt like they had the veggies sitting there until someone decide to order the fajita. The steak was okay and chicken was bland. The sides for the fajita seriously came out of a can I do not think anything was fresh! We also ordered the firestarter Margarita and that was horrible as well, there was no liquor just juice and jalapeños :( watered down. I should've walked out when I stepped into the old, run down decor. Our server was really sweet too bad the food fell short."}
{"text":"A new twist on Mexican food. The beef brisket taco is superb.  The service was great too, despite being packed on the weekend. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Favorite tacos and margarita in all of Charlotte!!!!!!! Love Love Love this place. The Firestarter margarita is the best in the world and has a great kick. The bar has a cool vibe too. Volcano queso is the best queso in the world and their house made tortillas are also the best in the world, but their machine broke and they haven't made those in months- the only thing that's made me disappointed with this restaurant ever. The Grilled Skirt Steak Taco and the Tanked Up Taco are my favorites. It really isn't the same since they haven't made their house made tortillas and I haven't gone as often as I used to because of it, but I will still give it five stars."}
{"text":"This is around the corner from my house so I should come here more often, but for some reason it wasn't until recently that I checked it out. I like that it is part of the dining rewards program so I get Delta miles for my purchases. They have a decent selection of Mexican and Texas beers.  My friends were enjoying the build your own margaritas. I had the ground beef tacos and they were good.    I will be back."}
{"text":"Great tex mex!  Try the charro beans and the maverick margarita! I would highly recommend this restaurant to locals and out of towners.  Also our waitress was very knowledgable about the menu and tequilas."}
{"text":"I went back a few days later.. Service was great. We were sat right away and had a really knowledgeable, fun server- Chelsea! Good was great as it always is!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food. From the chips and salsa, to our meals. The service was great. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful with the questions we had about the menu. We would definitely come back if we are in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Great tacos (I had the shrimp tacos) that come with a satisfying platter of food w/ beans, rice and slaw. Delicious slaw. Our table got the chili con queso to start and it was disappointing - flavorless, needed spices/salt/anything to make it more interesting. Didn't even have green chilies in it, just cut up bell pepper. Service was good and our chips/salsa stayed filled throughout the entire meal."}
{"text":"Great little spot in South Park, by the same owners as Big Daddy's. Has that same feel to it but with a Tex-Mex flare. The salsa is a bit different, in that they serve it warm as opposed to cold or room temp. It's different, but good. Had the Beef Brisket Taco's and they were amazing! Get them on the homemade soft tortillas. Yum."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to place when we want to grab some margaritas and tacos.  It's always busy so prepare to wait - we usually sit at the bar/bar area.  The tacos are always good and the warm tortilla chips with salsa are fantastic.  The service leaves a bit to be desired.  On our last visit we waited for almost a half hour just for our drinks.  If you can visit on an off day or time, you'll love it. If you're patient enough to wait, you might love it also!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for \"Mexican\" food. The salsa is spicy. I really like the enchiladas and the rice . Good beer selections."}
{"text":"Expected more from the likes of  Frank Scibelli. I am a rabid fan of his other establishments but Paco's just fell flat for me.   Chips and Salsa = forgettable The margaritas were strong, but the food was just like that appetizer - forgettable.   Worth giving them a few weeks and checking it out again, but the location was odd and along with a pretty uninspiring meal, I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"I'm from Houston, TX and have been trying to find a good Mexican restaurant for almost two years. So glad I found this place! We got fajitas, queso, and guacamole. Delicious! It's expensive but most good Mexican food is."}
{"text":"I love this place! Came here with my family at lunch, and the service was great once we told them it was out first time.  The fajita's were on par with the best I've ever had. Chips and Salsa are better than Cantina 1511.  The serving size was generous, and one could share the fajita's easily. Good vareity as well for vegatarians."}
{"text":"Great food all around (from the chips n salsa, volcano queso, to chicken enchiladas), drinks (huge tequila selection and make your own margarita), and good service!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time on a Sunday during game day, so thankfully it was slow. The service was very quick and gave wonderful suggestions. The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa was very fresh with a roasted or smoky, but authentic taste. Tacos were delicious with a very good flavor in the pork and brisket! Definitely a great place for the family as well. Lots of seating and a large bar. Must try if craving tex-mex or just good family dining!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town for a wedding and all I can say is WOW. That bacon wrapped jalapeños were excellent. The tacos were some of the best I've ever eaten. Highly recommended and I will visit again when we are back in Charlotte to visit my parents.10 stars"}
{"text":"David our waiter was outstanding. The place was packed but our food came piping hot and was great. Will put this place on our list to come back in the future."}
{"text":"Wow! First time here and crazy impressed! Do you like fresh and light and amazing atmosphere with amazing food this is an iconic destination!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Best guac and chips and salsa. Salad is good too. The wait here on the weekends is a bit nuts, but the food is usually worth it. Staff is friendly and quick to get your beverages and appetizers. This is one of my favorite Mexican places to eat, will return!"}
{"text":"Annie is the best. Loved the food and great service!!!  Delicious. Brisket is amazing."}
{"text":"I really go back and forth with love and hate for Pacos.  I think the food is really good.  The service can be awful.  For example, one time the waiter dropped a whole tray of waters on my one year old son and other than bringing some napkins over, did nothing.  A manager never came by.  He didn't even comp my sons kid meal.  He was soaking wet and we had to leave.    Another time the waiter forgot to put the kids meals and anyone with kids can guess what ensued when it took 15 minutes after our adult food arrived for the 1, 3, and 5 year old to get theirs.... again nothing whatsoever was done.  We get mad, wait a few months, go back, repeat...."}
{"text":"Yummy fresh chips and salsa. I love spicy food and adult beverages.  A must try is....the \"FIRESTARTER\","}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is delicious, portions are generous, and atmosphere is always fun and energetic. The bar area is nice it has bar seating as well as table seating that is next to a wall of windows. Very fun place to eat."}
{"text":"My sister has been raving about \"Taco's Pacos\" since she moved to Charlotte a few months ago. She basically lives across the street, so we added it to our must-see list on my recent visit. We met our cousin and her daughter for lunch and I was very impressed. The staff was on their game; the chips and salsa were delivered quickly and were yummy, and our waters were always full.   I ordered the small chicken quesadilla with a side salad. In hindsight, I wish I had just ordered a large salad because the side salad was one of the best I've ever had! It had a little too much dressing (ask for it on the side) but there were chickpeas, peppers, avocado, corn, etc etc etc in this salad. SO YUMMY. The quesadilla was good with a decent amount of salsa/sour cream/guac on the side, and it was a good value for the lunch. YUM."}
{"text":"So we started out heading to Chuy's and were shocked to discover they had moved. What to do now? We were in the mood for Mexican but had no idea where to go in the area. Thanks to this very app., we were suggested Paco's and were not disappointed. We had the feeling that we were on the right track as people seemed to all be heading in the same direction as we approached. We could shortly see why. Upscale, delicious Tex-Mex. would be the simplest way to describe Paco's. We both had 2 delicious tacos and can't wait to go back for more. My only complaint would be to have a beer special every day. Otherwise, perfection."}
{"text":"My love affair with Paco has come to an end. It is not as thrilling as in the early days of a new restaurant. The chips they used to have were light, thin, and they seemed freshly made; I couldn't keep my hands off them. The last time I was there they had the thick corn that was seemed like it was purchased in bulk. In addition, the flavor that once kept me coming back for more, seemed more muted.   Granted, the food is still okay and the service is still friendly. Perhaps \"it's me, not you.\""}
{"text":"This is seriously one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. It NEVER fails.   We came a few weeks ago on a crowded night and were sat and waited on promptly (we had a reservation).  We ordered drinks that came quickly and the tableside guac - which you HAVE to order because it is so delicious. I got a blood orange margarita, which I always get, and I swear it is the best margarita I've had.  I usually go for three tacos - although every time I order 3 tacos I remember I cannot eat 3 of their tacos. So delicious, you can't go wrong ordering tacos. You can select a combo of any of the tacos on the menu.    The service is great, the atmosphere is lively and fun, we will continue to be Paco's patrons!"}
{"text":"Pacos Tacos is awesome!! Beautiful home made tex mex food, beautiful 100% blue agave tequila, and a friendly, upbeat atmosphere and staff here. The guacamole is amazing, whether it's done table side or already on your tacos. Portions are large and good for sharing to mix and match and try a few things! Yee haw, Pacos! Well done."}
{"text":"First of all guys, if you wanna see a menu of Tequila do check this place. White, Gold, Aged - all types are there and yeah - you can get your fresh margarita made out of them if not interested in having it neat. Best salsa - it's fresh, spicy, tangy and tempting. I am from India and let me say Yeah its TANGY !!  Tacos as per ur wish, soft, crisp , etc etc. awesome service and a must at the South Park area."}
{"text":"As a former Texas resident with high standards for Tex-Mex, I was made aware with the first bite of a brisket taco at Paco's that North Carolina does indeed have great Mexican food.  It's a bit pricier compared to what you'd pay for a similar meal in San Antonio or Austin, but I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"I was just not impressed at all by this restaurant. I went a few weeks ago and I'm not sure why I had such high hopes for it but meh.  I had the steak fajitas and they were average not bad, just not exciting, and the vegetables were mush. The person I was with got a chimichanga  and it was really dry and tasteless. The tortilla chips were good and the salsa was really good! It had a decent heat and flavor to it and the chips seemed fresh.   The main reason I give it 2 and not 3 stars is because this place prides itself on it's tequila selection and it's \"oh so delicious\" margaritas.  I'm here to tell you they were not good.  The house margarita which was on special was pure sour mix and it wasn't a good sour mix either.  I had a different margarita (can't remember the name but it was the one with grand marnier), and again it just wasn't good.  My uncle makes an amazing margarita with grand marnier and this definitely did not compare (maybe I'm biased).  I was also disappointed not to see any real Sangria choices as I prefer that to margaritas when out and the wine prices are jacked up beyond belief  (I saw a few choices that they were charges by the glass the same price as you could get the entire bottle for at the store). I realize that some raising of the prices is needed to make a profit but $12 for a glass of wine that you can by the entire bottle for the same price?? Yeah I'm not buying that one!!   Needless to say I will probably give this place a second shot and update my review but currently not a fan!"}
{"text":"I love visiting Paco's for the uniqueness it brings. Great atmosphere and great food. Everyone we've taken here loves it. Service can be up and down sometimes, but is generally good."}
{"text":"Paco's has great burritos, fajitas, and even salads but their white queso (not on the menu by itself but you can still order it) is AMAZING and I come every time specifically for that. They also have great margaritas and if you get lucky (which is more often than not), you'll get a server who loves tequila and can mix you a cool concoction of their own. Did I mention their sour mix is homemade??"}
{"text":"Paco's tacos , what can I say , let me start with staff , very attentive without being intrusive for example  they replace the chips even though we were not done with it and gave us a fresh batch hot out of the oven , speaking of chips , they very crispy and well seasoned . appetizers and entrée's  were delicious . I would go . 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and both times the food was much too salty for my taste."}
{"text":"WOW! One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in Charlotte! (we're originally from AZ) Great food!!! & they serve REAL jalapenos! :) We had chips/salsa (best I've ever had), chimichanga and fish/beef tacos, they were awesome! Good drink deals and the service was perfect! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Client took me here for lunch and was just amazed. That salsa is incredible. Don't usually get excited about salsa, but man it's so good. Came back in town two weeks later and tried to eat at the bar, but the wait was too long (guess that is a great thing if you own the place). Ordered a pint of salsa, another huge delicious taco and the enchiladas to go back to the hotel.   Just can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"I Live 5 freakin minutes away and this was my first time here.....seriously? Well that's because the damn place is hidden away BEHIND the Williams Sonoma. I mean, Williams Sonoma has \"stolen\" thousands of my dollars and I never saw this place behind it.....I must speak with the architect!   OK, so now I know what all the fuss is about. Authentic Mexican? Not a chance. However, this place does serve REALLY good Tex Mex!   Fresh chips and excellent salsa? Confirmed! I added some delicious Chili con Queso and voila, excellent way to start off the lunch.  My friendly waiter made some recommendations and I went with them. He suggested the slow braised beef brisket, and I also selected a chicken fried steak taco. Man both were really excellent! Very flavorful with sweet/heat contrasting flavors. But while i knew the brisket taco would be good, the chicken fried steak was even BETTER! Halleluiah! Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Highly recommend this one!  Oh and the beans. Can forget about the charro beans. They have brisket in them with onions. Very savory and tasty. The only negatives was that the rice was average and the cole slaw sucked. But who cares when the mains are this good, right?  Overall a great first, but certainly not last, dining experience at Paco's Tacos!"}
{"text":"We came here for a Saturday lunch and were seated right away.  The booths are comfortable and the waiter was helpful and attentive.  Maybe it's because I now see this place is \"Tex Mex,\" but there was loud country music playing.  I like country, but this was very hillbilly country.  The food was excellent.  I opted for one of the combos and got a chicken quesadilla with the small chopped salad.  Both items were good although I think if I went back I would just get the chopped salad since it was so yummy.  My family enjoyed the quesadillas and tacos as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a little hidden so just be aware that it is in the back of the shopping area. I enjoyed both the green and red salsas and split a pitches of margaritas with my group- which oddly our server did not recommend to do. He said the pitches makes the margaritas get a little too watery- which I think could be fixed by not filling it so high with ice and having glasses full of ice to pour into. Overall it was a great drink $35 for a pitcher of house margaritas which had about seven pours.   Let me just say. This brisket is banging. I also has the charro beans which despite being cooked with bacon were nothing to write home about. Get the brisket. Prices are also pretty fair considering its Southpark and all."}
{"text":"Would you like it Chunky or Creamy?   :) Fresh Guacamole made to order at your table, IS the first thought that comes to mind when I think of Paco's.  Super fresh, delish, tasty guacamole every time, served with those complimentary chips which again is very tasty. The complimentary salsa is damn good too, would love it a bit more spicy though. We ordered couple corona's and order the mix and match taco's.  Couple Al Pastor and Wood Grilled Chicken taco's.  Phew 3 tacos sound like small portion right, but these are huge taco's served with rice, beans and slaw.  That's a huge portion enough for two.  Loved Al Pastor -  the pork was perfectly cooked and it was juicy and delicious.  What could go wrong with chicken taco it was perfect as well.  The beans was just as delicious and so was the rice. Always love the vibe at this place, and our waiter mentioned that Paco's was ranked 2nd best tex-mex in the country last year. Interesting!!"}
{"text":"After an awful experience at San Antonio's we decided to try Paco's Tacos and Tequila. We have been back three times and each time has been wonderful. The beef brisket tacos are amazing, and the jalapeno infused tequila margarita is the best margarita I have ever had. Everything is fresh, authentic, priced well, and service is great! Thank you for putting this great restaurant in South Park!"}
{"text":"I've heard from plenty of people that this place has the best hispanic food in Charlotte. Thus far, I haven't found better.  Its always crowded, which is a testament to their good food. Its a bit loud, but with all the people they have crammed in that restaurant, its to be expected.  Table side Guac was very delicious, and I LOVE their salsa (Free chips and salsa of course). I had a chimichanga and it was very delicious and very filling.  I'd love to come back, but its just so hard with the crowds that are always there. I wish they'd open another location. If you can find a time to dine there, know that its well worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in charlotte. They make their flour tortillas in house in fresh batches. If you sit at the bar you can see them make them! I recommend reservations on OpenTable to ensure short wait time. I recommend the fajita platter and the tortilla soup. The skinny margarita as good flavor, but can be too acidic at times for me. Chips and salsa are complimentary, but try to avoid filling up on them before the food comes! Service is generally good and the quality of the food matches the price. Parking is self Park, no valet. Can be tight during peak hours and may have to wait for one to open up."}
{"text":"I had tacos al pastor with pineapple, very good. Ships are light crispy and fresh.  Do not like being sat by the bathroom though"}
{"text":"Love this place. Fantastic Mecican food, across from South Park Mall. Unreal fajitas, enchiladas and pork carnitas. Service is always excellent. Make a rez. Can get packed in weekend nights."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, taco and salad combo.   Fresh and full of flavor.  ordered special tuna taco, which was overdone, but management was responsive and courteous.  Excellent wait staff.  Table side Guacamole was ample serving, especially compared to Cantina 1511.   Don Pedro's still does it better, adding radish or jicama for crunch, cilantro, and lemon juice. Margarita was well blended and tequila options were impressive.   Wait staff was impressive!   How Chuys stays in business so close to this place is impossible to understand,"}
{"text":"Start off by saying the food was AMAZING! You start with chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants. The salsa was really good! I also got the house margarita, also really good. Not your premix margarita, this tasted freshly made! I had 2 tacos. A paco taco and smokey & the brisket. Oh my so delicious! You could taste the smoke in the brisket! I liked the smokey & the brisket a little better because it had a fresh tomato salsa that made the taco very refreshing.  My husband had the open face pork quesadilla. He would not stop raving about how good they were.  The services was fantastic! We made a reservation and did not have to wait on a Saturday night at 730. Our waiter was also really friendly as well.  We will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"The food is in a class beyond \"Mexican\". The location is easy to access, the atmosphere is so, so relaxing especially at night. The staff was attentive, observant and kind. We made a reservation and ended up at a booth by the back right window beside the emergency exit - couldn't have asked for a better spot, honestly!  After tasty chips and salsa upon being seated, we ordered:  Jalapeno cheese filled bacon wrapped appetizer -      // Oh my God. Amazing fresh, but even better after sitting out / refrigerated. Order another and box it up before you leave!!  Enchilada di Dennis -     // Is this even real? It was PERFECT. The flavors, the smooth creamy texture, the temperature, the sides were okay but next time I'm definitely getting the 4 enchilada sampler.  This is my new favorite restaurant, period."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are both excellent, but it's the staff that has won my heart over. They are attentive, friendly, and really care about the details."}
{"text":"Been meaning to go here and finally did.  These are the best tacos in town!  The home made wheat tortillas were excellent. Also had the guacamole prepared at the table.  Will definitely be back when I get the itch for some tacos."}
{"text":"I'm seriously torn about how to review - as two stars or three.  This would have been four had it not been for the shortcut to an unplanned weight loss.  Business traveler, dining alone, weekday night.  Fairly busy. Sat in bar area at high top.  Prompt service.  Asked for and promptly received water, chips, salsa.  Salsa tasted great and had a good amount of heat.  Waiter made a few recommendations, including the pork carnitas.  Carnitas are always risky - I've had way too chewy and overcooked, I've had ok but stomach ache for a week and I've had \"damn, I should order that every time\" - but all from different establishments.  It was really feeling like more of a fish taco night so I compromised and ordered the Tuna Carnitas.  Sounded interesting and tasty!  Waiter came back and apologized saying they are taking it off the menu.  Hmmm.  I decided to not pursue the seafood angle based on that so rather than fish tacos instead went with waiter's original recomendation of Pork Carnitas - he reaffirmed my confidence in my selection by saying \"Now that's a great choice!\"  So I felt good about it.  And I have to say, they tasted excellent!!  Only, as I was walking to my car after having had a good amount of salsa and the carnitas (didn't really eat the beans which came with it) I felt the first \"uh-oh\" moment.  My hotel was literally only minutes away so I kept going.  That almost did not work out...within about 20 seconds of walking in my hotel room door I think I had literally lost 5 lbs.  My stomach is not that sensitive but this must have been caused by something I just ate to have had such a quick and unpleasant reaction.  On the positive side, thanks to the \"cleanse\", my suit pants weren't too snug the next day and I gave an unbelievable presentation to my client!  So 3 stars."}
{"text":"If I had to die, my last meal on earth would be Mexican. I love it so I rate it very highly. And after a recent bad experience at a competitor's Mexican restaurant I decided to try Paco's Tacos for the first time.   I came here on a Thursday night around 8 with my husband and a friend. It was pretty busy, but we got seated right away. Our server greeted us with water, chips and salsa. The salsa was great. It wasn't chunky (my husband isn't a fan of tomatoes) and had the right amount of spice. The chips were light and crispy. They tasted homemade. They were too good I couldn't stop eating them.   I ordered the two taco combo, which came with rice, slaw and beans. All for only $11 (they are full size tacos too!)  I got the charro beans. It reminded me of baked beans and was something different from your typical black or refried beans. For my tacos, I mixed and matched. The shrimp taco was my favorite. The chipotle ranch sauce was on point and there was TONS of shrimp on it!! There had to be at least 10 pieces. I also got the turkey carnitas. The turkey was moist and not dry. I would recommend the shrimp instead. My husband got the Paco's taco (beef brisket), which was my second fav.   Overall good vibes at Paco's tacos. I would highly recommend it to anyone and I will be back soon!   Ps try the slaw with your rice. It's awesome."}
{"text":"Paco's Tacos is the real deal! In spite of the great Yelp reviews, I still had my reservations about eating at another TexMex chain. How good could it be I thought? Well they totally nailed it, from the complementary chips and dip to the sauce stains on my napkin!  The dining area was empty and only a few people were at the bar upon my arrival for a late lunch. Adlai our server was very helpful with recommendations and was knowledgeable of the menu. I had a overstuffed grilled chicken taco which arrived with Mexican rice, mixed cabbage coleslaw and, their own, Charro style pintos, all at the incredible price of... drum roll please... 7 Bucks! My buddy tried Paco's Taco which is shredded beef and was equally as tasty. Servings are huge and everything was fantastic.   Premeal chips and salsa were delivered to the table immediately. The chips are very thin and were very fresh. The place was clean and attractive. Sanitation rating was a 95. For those long time Charlotteans like myself, you may remember this place as the old Manzetti's.  I'm going back soon! This place is a Gotta Try!."}
{"text":"Woah! This place has some seriously good tacos! I have been to Paco's previously for drinks and taco salad, but always heard good things about their tacos. It's true y'all... they are good!   My husband got Paco's Tacos (recommended with cabbage inside) and a stuffed jalapeño which was stuffed with cheese and wrapped with bacon. They were \"bomb\" as he said.   I got the Tanked up Taco (grilled) and the Crispy Shrimp. Both were delicious and FULL of flavor. I usually get guac on the side to dip my tacos, but I definitely didn't need to.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place!   Half price fajitas on monday nights after 8:30.  Great service.  You have to try the fried ice cram and brownie.  Even if you take it home for later.  One of the best brownies around."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Cantina 1511, Big Daddy Burger, etc....so I had to try out Paco's Taco's.  My husband and I stopped in on Sunday for an early dinner.  The place has only been open for about a week, and it did not disappoint.  The beef brisket taco is excellent, the service is excellent, and it's exciting to have this place close by in Southpark.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are awesome!! Service and cleanliness was horrible!!!  Food was just ok... I got the taco salad and the pita bread was HARD AS A ROCK and the flavor of the meat was not good! My husband got the cheese enchiladas and they were really greasy!! The older gentleman that works there is NOT friendly or helpful.  He would not ask if anyone needed more to drink and just put chips and sals on table.  We are a basket of chips and he just walked past seeing we did it have our drinks still! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!! We waited FOREVER before our waiter acknowledged us! Won't be back. There are much better places for Mexican food than this place!!!"}
{"text":"Really dissapointed. First, we were told it was a 35 minute wait but could count at least 8 empty clean tables.... One of which we sat at 35 minutes later. Second, other than the queso the food was just so so. The tortillas were great but the meat was somewhat bland, too much cilantro, and the rice tasted like it came straight out of a Zatarains box. I don't think we would go back for food, but maybe a drink. They had a decent list of tequila."}
{"text":"Can not give enough kudos to Pacos Tacos and Tequila. I thought we would never come across a decent tex mex in Charlotte. Yay! The Holy Guacamole done at tableside is perfection. They put just the right amount of salt and lime to get your mouth watering for one of their great margaritas and don't be afraid of going all in on the chili. It's a nice compliment to the avacado and not very spicy at all. We also tried the tortilla soup which was made in a nice light broth and chicken burrito that could have been shared by two men with big appetites and completely satisfied them. Overall the food was outstanding for Tex Mex and the price was great.  Our server was very friendly and the food came out right when we wanted it to. We also really enjoyed the setting. For me the only thing that could have made it better would be some Chili Rellenos on the menu, but other than that I was a happy camper. There has been a lot of thought put into the upfit of the restaurant space. We were seated in the back of the restaurant which has a great decor and nice natural lighting coming through its roof which is plastered with skylights. We all agreed this will become one of our regular Charlotte haunts. Thanks Pacos!"}
{"text":"Get there early as they get packed. Tues night special $3 NC drafts. Love their queso. The Paco Taco and carnitas are awesome tacos. Can't wait to come back again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant Week deal during Queen's Feast. Fun atmosphere, good margaritas and delicious guac. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, and it's even better when you sit at the bar. The tacos are delicious and I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. Take out is great too."}
{"text":"The great Charlotte taco hunt continues, this time we landed at Paco' Tacos with high expectations. Cool place, insanely popular, plan on waiting a bit (we went and poked around some nearby shops for a few).  When I time came we were promptly seated and delivered chips and salsa, which were delicious. Definitely dig that salsa!  We ordered 4 different tacos, ground beef, pork, chicken, and steak. The chicken was tasty, the pork with pineapple salsa was awesome, the steak was dry and chewy, and the ground beef tasted like dry beef jerky.  I could eat tons of the Mexican rice, that and he salsa were my favorite parts of the meal.  Honorable mention for the fresh made tortillas, the flour tortilla was especially tasty!  A little bummed overall, we were hoping the tacos were going to be bangin' but they left us wanting to look elsewhere to fill that gaping taco shaped hole in our hearts."}
{"text":"Food - 2/2 *I've eaten here multiple times and I've never had anything I don't like.  The tacos (all of them) are excellent.  My favorites are the skirt steak, tanked up and shake down shrimp.  But my personal favorite menu item is the mac and cheese.  It a delightful Texas style mac/cheese that has a kick to it. It's creamy and delicious!  My go-to upscale Tex-Mex restaurant in South Charlotte.  Service - 1/1 *No complaints here.  Friendly, helpful.  Nothing extraordinary, but solid.  Price - 0.5/1 *A little higher than I'd like to pay, but that's what you have to expect in Southpark.  Let's be serious though - $9 for guacamole is outrageous.  Atmosphere - 1/1 *Fun place to have dinner.  Packed on the weekends, but if if's packed, you can still walk around different shops and they'll call you when you table is ready. One night I found a table in the bar area, while it was crowded, and still had a great time.   Listen, all of Frank Scibelli's restaurants (Mama Ricotta's, Cantina 1511, Bad Daddy's Burger Bar, Midwood Smokehouse, and Paco's Tacos & Tequila) are 5/5.  I've come to like this place better than Cantina 1511.  It's the best place to have tacos in the city."}
{"text":"I am a part-time Uber driver in Charlotte and I've picked people up from here a few times. Since it's near some hotels, I sometimes recommend it as a good spot for a nice meal and good margaritas. However, today was my first time actually dining here after meeting one of the chefs and taking him home from work.  We were window shopping at the South Park mall and decided to come here around 5:30 on a Sunday. We were sat quickly in a comfortable part of the restaurant and immediately greeted with a smile and the customary chips and salsa. My wife, who doesn't like spicy things, really enjoyed the sauce which had just the right amount of kick! We also ordered some table-side guacamole, which was fresh and tasty but felt a little bland. We make our guacamole at home with lime juice, so that is probably a matter of taste.  That night, they had a special edition \"blackened salmon\" taco which sounded delicious, but we did not try it. I had the \"enchiladas de Dennis\" and my wife had the roasted vegetable enchiladas. She got some fried plantains on her plate, which were sweet and delicious! Great rice and beans. The plates themselves were a little bland, but nothing a little salt, pepper and Tapatio can't solve.  I also tried the Pineapple & Mint Margarita, which was like a cross among a Mai Tai, a margarita and a mojito. It was a really creative drink that I enjoyed.  Overall, I would say it's a great spot. Good, affordable food, quick service, good drinks and a great atmosphere. Would definitely recommend to just about anyone."}
{"text":"I've wanted to come here for a year... I just love the feel, decor... Nice comfortable fun atmosphere. Our waitress was amazing! Between the 3 of us we ordered 4 dinners and had leftovers. The chicken something enchiladas was so yummy! Fish taco (minus spicy sauce) grilled was my favorite. The beans baked with beef and onions were such an awesome touch!! Loved those instead of refried (which they do offer). Great food, efficient friendly waitstaff and fun place :)"}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with this place!! I have been here a few (dozen) times and they never disappoint! Most of the time I take out but I ate in once and the staff is great! I love how when you are waiting for a table they sit you at the bar or a smaller table to provide you with water and chips and salsa! I love getting the vegetable fajitas!! And I always ask for them to put cheese and Jalapenos on my fires and they never have an issue doing it even though it's not on the menu that way. Just writing this review makes me want to go there right now! Awesome awesome food!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  First time here.  Service was quick.  Sat at the bar since I was alone.  Fish Tacos were great. Would get them next time, too.  I actually went solely because they participate in UPromise.  Glad I did!"}
{"text":"My favorite tacos and favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.  To drink try a firestarter. A spicy marg that is delicious. All pretty pricey specialty drinks but all the ones I have had are good.  I only get queso, salsa, and guacamole and tacos here but I've been with people who get other things and they all like what they get as well.  All the tacos I have had are very tasty but my personal favorite is the Pacos Taco which is a beef brisket taco slightly spicy a 10 hour slow roasted chili rubbed beef brisket with caramelized onions and chipotle BBQ sauce.  I have also had the Al Pastor, Chicken Milanesa, and Chicken Fried Steak makes me drool just thinking about these.  GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"Good place to go eat. It reminds me of Texas with the way it is decorated. A little pricy but a fun at atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not Bad!!! Reminds me of Texas!!!! Had the Chimichanga just have them hold the Queso for the side might be too much sort of smothered everything else. Enjoy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was great.   If you're paying for a big party, be sure to check all the items on your receipt.  Evidently, my waiter snuck in a couple of Margaritas on my check.  Because the assumption is, is that you will not likely check what everyone ordered and would just pay for it all and sign.  Read your itemizations before paying!"}
{"text":"This place has great prices and and amazing food. I had the fajita  but everyone around me was getting pacos tacos."}
{"text":"Dang good tacos! I thought it a bit pricey for tacos. Once I tried them though - I knew it was well worth it. Mix and match - one of my buddies didn't realize you can do that so I thought I would mention it. If you are looking for possibly the best tacos in Charlotte - this is the joint!"}
{"text":"Second time I'm here with my husband, and it was amazing Our favorite Mexican place. Wonderful service, friendly atmosphere. Defiantly will be back"}
{"text":"I had the pork tacos. Yummy. The salsa was great it has a Smokey flavor with a touch of heat   ALso our server was great and friendly  I will be back"}
{"text":"My girlfriend, her parents and I made a reservation here for NYE. We showed up a few minutes early and were seated immediately.  We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, white queso, and the table made guacamole to start. The margaritas were good, but could have been a little stronger. The queso was delicious- duh. And the guacamole was awesome because you can customize it since its table made- it's also a huge portion. The server also brought salsa and chips. The salsa was SPICY! We also got tomatillo salsa that was less spicy and tasty. The chips are super thin and you will eat way too many.   I ordered enchiladas de dennis with charro (pinto beans with onions, bacon, and brisket) and my girlfriend got the 3 taco combo with rice and retried beans. Both entrees were $13 which was very reasonable because it was a LOT of food...or maybe we were full from all the chips.   The enchiladas were so good, covered in cheese and tons of flavor. My girlfriend got the Paco Taco (10 hour smoked beef brisket), Tanked Up (beer battered white fish), and Shake Down Shrimp tacos. They were all delicious! The tortillas are thick, more like pita but they are stuffed full so maybe the thickness is to hold it all in. Whatever it is, it's good!   My girlfriend has already said she wants to have her birthday dinner here, which is 7 months away. There was a bacon, egg, and cheese enchilada we might have to try out.  Overall the restaurants atmosphere was relaxed and funky, the service was good, and the food was amazing. Check this place out ASAP!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant i have eaten at in a long time.  The service was great and the food extraordinarily fresh for a mexican restaurant. Chips fresh with tasty salsa.    I got the veggie enchiladas and they were fantastic.  I will be back with family in tow."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, I think i was Hispanic during my past life or something because I absolutely loveeeeee Mexican food! Now you cant really find authentic Mexican food around this area but this place is pretty legit.   definitely recommend the steak tacos and brisket nachos!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Lots of bang for your buck! The place was crowded for a Wednesday night and now I know why. The food was excellent, reasonably priced, and the portions were large. Too bad there are no pina coladas on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant, if my boyfriend and I don't know where we want to eat or aren't craving anything, let's go to Paco's! They offer 3 different kinds of salsa, all amazing. Queso, so great you'll never not order it (not if you love cheese as much as me!) I've had most of the tacos on the menu and have yet to try one I don't like. I highly recommend the Rusty El Camino margarita, but be careful if you're driving because it's a deliciously strong one!   Let's be real, you can go to RuRu's tacos and tequila but not get free chips and salsa and pay the same amount for a margarita that's half the size of Paco's. By far, best Tex-Mex the the CLT, and yes I've tried quite a few places."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy YUMMY. Unique flavors. Great service. Excellent margaritas. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Tried this after Taco Maco fell down and let us sit on the patio for 10+ minutes without waiting on us.   The margaritas were amazing and food was equally good.  The table side guacamole was awesome!!!  Ask for Shauna!!!"}
{"text":"Very good salsa. If you like heat they will bring hotter out. Also the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeños are great. Their brisket tacos are the best meat tacos I have ever had. And they have a good selection of beer and tequila."}
{"text":"Have been hearing amazing things about this place so had to go try it out. We ate lunch here today and boy the food is good. I had the shrimp and fish taco, it came with coleslaw, beans, rice. It was a plate full and was just the amount if you are quite hungry. If not very hungry, I'd say one taco is good enough. The pineapple margarita was very tasty!!! I am sure to come back to try other items in menu :)"}
{"text":"I don't get the somewhat middling rating for this place. This place is amazing. The chips were good with two decent salsas - one green and one red. Had three different tacos. The Paco Taco which has a slowed cooked chili-rubbed brisket in it. Unbelievably good. An amazing fish taco, the best I've ever had, which unfortunately will not be offered on the restaurants new menu. Too bad because it was delicious. The last taco had skirt steak in it. It too was great but the Paco Taco was even better. The platter had rice, a slaw with amazing fresh ingredients like corn sliced right off the cob, and awesome Charro beans. Everything was hot and seemed incredibly fresh. $2 Shiner Bock drafts on Thursdays was a plus. This is now my go to place when I spend the night in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor of Pacos Tacos, my husband and I usually come here every Sunday after church at 11 and are the first customers to open the doors. The food is always amazing (I have never had one bad item), the service is good, and we enjoy the music selection.   Since I come here so often one of my friends gave me a gift card to here for my birthday (she knows me well). That next Sunday we put it to use only to find that the money she put on it did not register on the gift card. The manager came over to let us know this and was very apologetic. I spoke to my friend in regards to the amount that was on the card and the manager put that amount on the card and more for our troubles, no questions asked. The customer service she provided went above and beyond what she needed to do. We thought we loved Pacos before but now we know this is the best place in Charlotte.   Since this is my favorite place I will also give some recommendations on the food I love here: Veggie fajitas, enchiladas de dennis (I usually see if I can get it with ground beef instead of chicken), the beef chimichanga (we get this with queso over the whole things instead of the half and half sauce), chopped salad is amazing as well as the chicken tortilla soup, the guacamole is made fresh at the table, the queso is amazing, the tacos are amazing I love the pacos taco, gringo beef, wood grilled skirt steak, and we love the BBQ buttered Corn.   Again I cannot recommend Pacos enough, thank you for showing quality customer service and the best Mexican food in town."}
{"text":"This is my second time here after not having a good first experience & giving a huge amount of time away from the moment to come back again to give it another try. First time was a hair in the food. Which I have to say they took off of the menu (Ceviche apt.) This time just didn't do anything to make me go back again. I would rather go to an On The Border.  Nice bar selection, but it doesn't make a difference if the bartender can't make a drink. We sent back our drinks 2 times & then I just gave up. Food wasn't anything special either. The quesadilla that should have chicken in it was mostly just filled with cheese. Hubby ordered the beef beef brisket. It was way to salty & cold. I had the fajitas which were tasty. The one great thing is the salsas they offer. Great flavor & heat! Unfortunately it's not enough for me to return. I think this place gets such a high rating for it being in South Park.   No Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Both the food and service were A+. Both my girlfriend and I did the three taco entree. It's really cool they let you mix and match and get any three tacos. The Chicken Fried Steak and Smoked Brisket were the best, but really can't go wrong. The tacos are a very good size and the soft shell is nice and thick. I added a bacon stuffed jalapeno which is a must if you like spicy.  The service was just as great as the food. They refilled our chips before we were even done. Not just putting new chips on top of the ones still in the basket, but giving us a full basket of fresh ones. Also, the manager came around and refilled waters. I would say we had a total of three plus our waitress serve us.  Overall we can't wait to come back to Charlotte and for Paco's to be our first stop!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Liked it even better when they had the trivia game, but they got rid of it. Sadly we probably won't be going as often without it, but still a good choice when you want a good tex-mex meal."}
{"text":"Super solid place to grab lunch. I was visiting a friend and she loves this place so off we went. The place was pretty busy for Saturday lunch and our server was prompt and kept up with his busy tables pretty well. I ordered the fajitas and it was a good portion, I wasn't super hungry so I split with a friend and it was more than enough. The veggies were seasoned perfectly and I could have just ate those and skipped the chicken. My friends ordered the lunch taco plates and they were all satisfied. The chips, queso, and guacamole was also a pretty tasty started. I mean can you ever really go wrong with queso?! We had a bit of a hard time finding the place since we parked in the back lot, but the signs were fairly clear to help us find our way!"}
{"text":"I love this place for the out of the box type of Mexican. I always get the chimichanga and last night it delivered, as usual. The salsa happens to be my favorite in the surrounding area, not too runny, not to chunky with the perfect heat. The cadaliac marg was refreshing, but not too sweet! Wait staff was decent, but they are steadily busy all night."}
{"text":"Love the tacos queso!  Yes, the QUESO is important!  Great atmosphere and sides.  Fantastic fajitas!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to catch up with some old friends! Our waitress kept the chips and salsa filled on top of being attentive. The food was good. The margaritas were great. Overall, wonderful experience! Also, I liked the atmosphere too - many cool decorations!"}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend here for linnet. Around 4, so definitely not lunch but a bit too early for dinner. Anyways, I had never been here before and the restaurant is actually a decent size. We sat next to the kitchen entrance, right in front of a television (it was football Sunday!).  When I sat, I was almost immediately greeted and asked if I knew what I would like to drink.  My friend and I were chit chatting a bunch (we had not seen each other in quite a while) and she did check on us twice before I was ready to order - which was perfectly fine! She was very polite about it. When it came down to it, I asked her opinion and I took her suggestion.  I ordered two taco platter; the paco taco and the shrimp taco, no beans.  The food came out relatively fast. But I was munching on chips and salsa (the salsa was a bit hotter than I expected, but definitely delicious!). The rice was nice, not dry! They did provide a slaw but I did not eat it too much - but it wasn't that bad. The tacos... the brisket one (Paco's) was flavored nice but the taco was over stuffed and when I bit into it I grabbed wayyyy more meat than I wanted and it was a mess. So instead I just ate it with my fork. The shrimp taco was good (but not enough sauce). The shrimp and battered and fried. The server was super nice and sweet. She checked on us just the right amount of times and was not overbearing.  The food, was not the best but pretty good. I definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Top tacos in Charlotte. Paco's Tacos. Bring your appetite!  Bartenders do a great job as well in case you're thirsty."}
{"text":"Best chicken tortilla soup around. Very hearty and brothy at the same time. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I decided to try something different tonight and ventured out to try this place. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the white fish tacos which were absolutely delicious! Compared to most Tex Mex places its a little more expensive with slightly smaller portions. I will most definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"I visited Paco's for the first time during Restaurant Week along with a lot of others! My friend made 7:00 p.m. reservations on a Tuesday night and the place was packed! The only sour note was that, even with reservations made, we still had to wait around 15 minutes to be seated. However, it was worth the wait....  The restaurant week menu offered A LOT of food plus a margarita for $30/person. The drink special was the No Name margarita (very good!) with offering of four other courses. First course was choice of queso (beef, white, or yellow) - my table ordered each one since there were three of us. ALL GOOD!  Second course offered choice of pork nachos or guacamole. Two of us ordered the guac, which is prepared table-side with choice of it being smooth/creamy or chunky and level of spice. I asked for chunky guac and for it to be made 'medium' but I didn't really taste much spice.  Third course was choice of tacos, various enchiladas, or fajitas. I went for the three tacos (get choice of tortilla): Shrimp, fish, and turkey club tacos. The shrimp taco was my favorite with choice of beans and rice.  For dessert, choice of tres leches cake or brownies with strawberries. I went for the brownies.  With all of the choices offered, you would think the portion sizes would suffer but they did not. Everything was delicious and generously sized. There was no way I could finish everything so I had my remaining guac (which I was able to snack on for three extra days) and tacos packed up to go.  I will DEFINITELY be going back to Paco's because I think I've found a new favorite Mexican spot."}
{"text":"I typically don't write reviews -- so you can take this with a grain of salt.   I tried to order take-out and was placed on hold. I waited 3.5 minutes before deciding to hang up and try again. I was placed on hold again... this time I waited a full 5 minutes before deciding to hang up and try again. The third time I was placed on hold before getting a chance to say what had happened. The fourth time I was told I would HAVE to be put on hold to send the call over to the bar.   I gave up."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for lunch with my friend and LOVED it! I had the Enchiladas de Dennis, which was recommended by the server, and ate it all up! The rice, beans, and salsa were also all very good and I can't wait to go back. The bar looked nice, and I loved the bar stools. Next time, I'll be coming at dinner time so I can also try out their margaritas :)"}
{"text":"Loved our time here! Very nice decor in a very nice shopping center. Kendel our waitress was great! She explained the drinks in order of popularity and intensity. The house salsa is spicy which is great for me because we love spicy! The food was outstanding! I got the enchiladas de Dennis which was a great twist on your standard enchiladas and my mom got bacon wrapped shrimp which were also delicious! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place.  Made reservations for 7pm, got a table at 8pm.  First thing I ordered was out.  Waiter recommended something else.  The food was horrendous - not just bad flavor, fundamentally inedible.  This place is typical for Southpark restauarants - crowded and very marginal food."}
{"text":"Delicious!! The tacos are outstanding. The fried fish and the pulled pork were my favorites. The service was extremely fast and the chips and salsa was very tasty."}
{"text":"I seriously don't even know where to start! There are just so many great things about Paco's Tacos that it's hard to pick.   We arrived for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. There was a super short wait. The place was packed! I have never seen a restaurant turn over and clean tables so efficiently and well. It made my previous server heart happy!   We were seated quickly and instantly greeted by our server, Roger. He was super attentive and personable. Having been our first time here, he was also helpful in making some taco suggestions.   We ordered the chili con queso dip. It came out fairly quickly and was so delicious. It was flavorful and creamy. Their salsa is amazing. Smokey and a but spicy. Loved it!  I ordered two tacos, steak and the shrimp. It comes with red rice, coleslaw and your choice of beans. It opted for black beans. I also put those tacos in a corn tortilla. My hubby ordered the chicken enchiladas and our kiddo ordered the chopped salad.   My tacos were outstanding. My eyes were bigger than my tummy and I ended up bringing my steak taco home. I just couldn't power through. The shrimp taco was so delicious. Lots of flavor and a little bit of heat. Absolutely outstanding. My hubby and kiddo equally enjoyed their food.   I wish we had a Paco's where I live. I would eat there about every day. There were still several tacos I would love to try. Definitely will back!"}
{"text":"Flavorful, complexly satisfying Tex-Mex. Try the enchilada sampler and 3 tacos on a date and share with each other (enough leftovers for another entire email). Superb!"}
{"text":"Wish I came here more. Might possibly be best tequila selection in town. They have a lot of high end stuff including Don Julio Real and Clase Azul. Not too surprising because of the south park location. The service is on point and very prompt. As soon as we sat down we were greeted and the manager welcomed us with arms full of chips and salsa (; The tortillas used for the tacos are awesome! Our favorites to get are the 'Paco's tacos' brisket and the chicken 'Milanese'. Can get a little crowded on Friday nights (like most places). Try to arrive around or before 5 or you might be forced to sit and dine with one of the chatty regulars at the bar. We dig Paco's tacos."}
{"text":"We had excellent service. The salsa was good enough to drink! Light crispy chips and perfect guacamole. I had a house margarita. It was good, but light on tequila. For my dinner, I had the brisket tacos. They were delicious! The charro beans were good, too. Definitely plan to go.back!"}
{"text":"Go here! Our waiter, John was awesome and helpful with our menu choice.  We had the seafood ceviche for an appetizer..$10 very good, and each of us had the combo #2 and substituted the pork tamale for the paco taco....this was a great meal!  Upgrade for $1 to the side salad..definitely worth it!  We will go back here next time we are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"A star has been added for OUTSTANDING customer service!!!  After writing my original review, I was contacted by \"Stephanie\" with FS Food Group (Big Daddy's Burger Bar, Mama Ricotta's, Plate Perfect Catering, Cantina 1511, and Paco's Tacos & Tequila).  She apologized for the error with  the $8 split plate fee and asked for a copy of our receipt to clear up the mistake.  To make a long story short, we were charged only $2 for the split plate but they did inadvertently charge us for the dinner portion vs. the lunch portion of fajitas.  Next thing you know, I open my mailbox and guess what's there???  A gift certificate with a handwritten thank you note appreciating my help!  I love a business that \"gets\" customer service!  Nice job FS Food Group.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  The atmosphere is fun and the service is awesome.  I like how the Chef takes pride in his food and features new dishes and specials that aren't on the menu.  The firestarter margarita is AMAZING-infused tequila topped  with a jalepeno garnish.  They give you options for a variety of beans, rice and have the whole wheat tortilla available.  Great place for an all around great experience!"}
{"text":"Love this place.. it's cute inside, good service, amazing food.. the tortillas are homemade and everything tastes really fresh"}
{"text":"I may be mistaken but I think these are the same people that used to own Cantina  1511 before they jacked up the prices and the quality went downhill. Regardless, I really like this place. It is in a great location tucked behind South Park Mall so people from all areas south of 277 can get to it with ease. I don't really tend to notice ambiance unless it is for a date or there is something special. However, there is something (which I can't put my finger on) that personally put me at ease here. The food is mid-range priced Tex-Mex but high quality taste. Even the chips are noticibly better than other Tex-Mex restaurants. The complimentary salsa has a bit more kick than most. It is tasty but be forewarned. I tend to always end up gravitating to the tacos and depending on appetite, and how many free chips I've consumed, I can order two or three (I can always take home that third). They have some pretty unique taco options and what is great is that you can mix and match. I have not tried a bad one yet. Although I am still working my way down the menu ;-) Also, if you are here with your friends, be festive and grab one of their signature margaritas. They are delicious!"}
{"text":"I stopped in when I was traveling for business and have been back a few times when I am in the area.  This is a great restaurant for Tex-Mex food. The chips and salsa are addicting. The chips have the perfect amount of salt. The menu has a lot to choose from. The margaritas are good and the service ranges from okay to good depending on the crowd.  The food isn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's good, it's always good, everything on the menu is good. It's consistent, it's fresh, and the portions are more than you'll need. Chicken burrito is a bit dry but works with salsa. Shrimp tacos are very good, with a decent amount of shrimp. Steak quesadilla is very cheesy (white cheese) and the tortilla has the perfect slight crispness. Food is also quickly prepared."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent.  Best Tex-Mex outside of Texas.  Everything about this meal was perfect.  From the delicious chips and salsa to the entrees.  I'm not a fan of food made spicy for the sake of being hot.  Both of the salsas and the queso had a spicy flavor without being hot.  One of the highlights was the three Shiner beers on tap: Bock, 102, and the Ruby Red.  All fresh and cold, and only $5 for 20 oz.  We had two entrees: the barbacoa special and the enchiladas.  I've never had better.  Usually enchiladas are just a mess of cheese and a sauce.  These were flavorful and bite after bite you could taste the distinctive flavors."}
{"text":"Normally, I don't put a lot of thought into the service I receive. Take my order, bring my food, and drop off/pick up check. My main concern is always the food.  Good enough to come back or nah?  I had great food and service during my first visit to Paco's.  The food came out fast and my waitress was really nice and helpful. Can't remember her name because of course I was only focused on the food at the time. We began with the smoked bacon wrapped jalapenos. I think there was cheese inside but I was focused on the bacon, which was nice and crispy and definitely not undercooked or burnt. I had the enchilada sampler which was good overall. My least fav was the roasted veggie enchilada.  There was cinnamon-y or something flavor that was just weird and the black bean sauce over top made it look unappealing.  I ordered the Texas mule to drink which was pretty tasty but I should have gone with a margarita.  My companions had the outlaw steak fajitas and the ambushed shrimp.  I tried the shrimp and it was really good but honestly anything wrapped in bacon is gonna be dynamite. I left Paco's stuffed and planning a return visit.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Really nice staff, competent servers, delicious food. (And very reasonably priced! Bonus.) My kiddos love anything that involves beans and rice and this restaurant is within walking distance from our house. Perfect. Endless chips and salsa for the kids and a margarita for mama. Does it get any better than this?  My husband and I have also ordered take out and were pleased with that as well. The other night I really just wanted to order chips and salsa to munch on while watching March Madness, I had no need for a huge meal - much to my surprise I could order an individual taco for $4. I ordered the crispy shrimp taco in a crispy corn taco shell, my husband ordered a veggie quesadilla (Friday during Lent for all you Catholics out there...no meat!) and our grand total came to $14. This $14 included a HUGE bag of crispy chips and two kinds of salsa. I felt a little guilty paying less than $15 for dinner! But I got over it.  Thumbs up! It always looks busy so I guess people keep coming back. If you haven't given it a try, I recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food and absolutely amazing jalapeño margaritas. Location is hidden so it is hard to see. I was recommended here by a co-worker and now always tell everyone to go there, because otherwise you may not know it is there."}
{"text":"I just love this place!  Whenever I'm in South Park I make an excuse to come here for tacos! My absolute favorite is the turkey carnitas tacos.    Things to remember about the tacos- they are BIG.  If you aren't a big eater two may be a lot.  They also come with slaw, beans and rice.  There's a ton to choose from.  I also like the fish, but any are delicious.  They also come with a choice of 4 or 5 different tortillas which include wheat, corn, flour, low carb...maybe another!  Try this place out for delicious Tex mex...but with a place like Pacos Tacos- trying the tacos is pretty much required.  They also have different drink specials depending on the day and a nice little patio.  If you're having a taco craving in South Park, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Some places you can tell are going to be good , just by walking past them and getting a whiff of what they're cooking. Pacos Tacos is definitely one of those places. I tried this place for the first time , after completing a Barre class at a studio within walking distance . I ended up getting a chicken taco bowl ( on the menu it's called a Fiesta Bowl), that was awesome. The fajita chicken was grilled just right, none of that rubbery chicken business. I will definitely be keeping this place in mind the next time I visit the South Park area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Don't go on weekends as the wait is awful.  Food is great.  A bit pricey for mexican food."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Paco's a bunch of times for lunch over the past four years. My employer's regional office is in South Park, so this is one of a handful of restaurants my co-workers frequent when we're in town for a meeting or training. I've never been here for dinner, but I highly recommend Paco's for a tasty and hearty lunch.  I typically get the tacos- they have several different combos that are good. Brisket, fish or shrimp, skirt steak, and gringo beef are all good. The sides of rice and refried or black beans are a good compliment. My favorite other than the tacos is the \"bacon egg and cheese\" enchilada. It has jalapeño bacon with a chili/gravy and a fried egg on top. Not the healthiest thing in the world, but so tasty!    Service is typically good. It can get slow during busy times like many other places, but I don't remember any issues. I can eat here once a month or more and still keep coming back."}
{"text":"Tasteless .. please save your money and do not come here. This is anything but authentic Mexican food. Guacamole was literally just smashed up avocados with zero seasoning. I really dont know how this place has a high rating"}
{"text":"You know when people rave about a place and then maybe your expectations are too high?  Maybe that's what happened here cuz I thought it was sorta average.    Good food but not the wow factor I thought would happen.  The chili was beanless (yay) and came with sour cream, cheddar, and scallions.  The flavor was good, but would have liked more kick.  Also had a shrimp taco, and while it was also good, I wouldn't make a special trip for it.  Great service, ample seating, but it's the kind of place that I'd probably never argue if someone suggested going, but the suggestion wouldn't come from me."}
{"text":"Good sangria. Food mediocre.   Food - I was able to finally gotten around to this place. Heard good things from the hubby. I had ordered the \"Dennis Enchiladas,\" and was let down by the dry meat, dried rice, and it was not satisfying.  The only thing that made me happy was the delicious red sangria.  Price - it was not that bad, the price was decent, especially when you get a large portion of food on your plate (that I was not expecting - suddenly, I felt full).  Service - We had a kind waitress that was attentive.  The Tex-Mex food was alright and nothing to rave about. As a native Houstonian, I was disappointed. Ah well."}
{"text":"delicious, great service, was extremely busy and we still got a table, prompt & delicious food, the Guacamole is yummy and made fresh in front of you! Of course you must try the Tequila."}
{"text":"Their chips are amazing and I have tried so many of their tacos. It is an amazing place to eat and has a great environment/setting to eat in. Definitely one of my top 5 places to eat of all time."}
{"text":"I stopped in for tacos during the evening around 9:00 pm and there were people there but it was not overflowing.  Since I went by myself I sat at the bar.  I was greeted promptly, my drink order was taken and the chips and salsa arrived quickly, always a plus.  I ordered the smokey and the brisket taco and the  fish, which comes grilled or fried. They offer a choice of tortillas, corn or flour and hard or soft tacos.  They have charro beans, refried or black.  The food was very flavorful and the portions were generous.  Two tacos with the beans and rice was a large meal.  I chose the charro beans and they were great.   If you aren't real hungry, one taco would be enough.  The only reason I am not giving this five stars was due to the follow up service from the bar.  No one asked if I wanted another drink or checked back with me once the food arrived except to drop the bill and they weren't that busy.  Still, I would recommend and return to try some of the other tacos."}
{"text":"Well I had never had tex-mex before and I was very curious!  This is my first experience eating brisket (I was told this is the best thing to order at a tex-mex place) and it was delicious!  ....And there is a but....So I am a Northerner and I probably have this wrong so please forgive me....but am I allowed to compare brisket to bbq in the sense that good bbq usually does not have a lot of fat or grisel or bones?  Is brisket supposed to have clumps of fat in it?  If so - and if I am clueless, please forgive the reference to it and skip my review, but if you are the tiniest grossed out by big pieces of fat, dont get the brisket here.  Ok fat conversation over.  Other than that the brisket that I got in my tacos was very tender and delicious.  Yet I was kind of wondering 'where is the rest?'  I gave this place only two stars because the hard-shelled tacos I got had probably three good mouthfuls of brisket and no lettuce or other fillings in them so they pretty much came out 1/3 full for over ten bucks?  (I ordered two tacos but I think you can order 1 or 2 or 3).  No amount of dry Spanish rice on the plate could make up for it.  The meal also came with your choice of beans which were very good.  The pic posted shows the truth of portion size so judge for yourself.    Service was excellent and they were constantly adding chips to the basket on the table.  Sigh...in the end I couldnt get over the fat I had to pick through or that it cost so much for so little.  I hope to try this place in a few weeks and add more stars."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time on the reviews on YELP. It was very good and the service was very good. Emily was very friendly and she kept up with our drinks. She knew the menu very well and steered us toward the best tacos on the menu.  We will be back even with the somewhat limited menu. We would have liked to see burritos, but everything else was worth the visit."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The choice of tacos is incredible. My favorite is the Paco Taco, but I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. Get the queso with the chips. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Paco's is pretty good, but not great. The chips and salsa are incredible, but they were more flavorful than the tacos that I had. My wife had the chimichanga, which was average.   The chips and salsa as well as the drinks will bring me back here, but I might skip the tacos next time."}
{"text":"great food and margaritas. I normally don't like margaritas but tried theirs and they are fantastic.  chips and salsa are also very good..salsa has a little kick to it of which I am a big fan. Try the tuna tacos..tons of food and great taste.  tons of sushi grade tuna in the tacos. desserts are very good too."}
{"text":"Wow, I enjoyed eating at Paco's Tacos. Try their Unholy Guacamole to start. I enjoy their beef burrito and enchiladas too.  The portions are large and the prices are reasonable.  I have never had room for desert."}
{"text":"Paco's Tacos automatically gets a star for awesomely rhyming their name.  I could say that all day...Paco's Tacos.  Well done, branding team!  But really, that's not why I come here.  As far as Mexican Restaurants go in Charlotte, Paco's gets a solid gold star.  This place is always packed.  Usually I sit at the bar so I can be a bit more relaxed.  The bartenders won't bother you because they are running around making drinks for the tables, so if you want something, you have to flag them down.  Decor is pretty standard and welcoming.  It's not a modern or rustic or modern rustic vibe.  Just good ole' Mexican Restaurant decor.  Food is, well, YES.  I recommend starting with the cheese dip.  It comes out quick and it's really good.  You can add beef or chicken to give it some extra flavor.  TIP:  Add a side of Tortillas for $1.  It's like you can make mini quesadillas while you wait for your meal.  If you're not full by then, order the tacos or fajitas.  Usually I am full, so I end up with the small chopped salad with grilled chicken.  The menu is pretty \"health friendly\" if you can stay away from the chips, but has lots of the good stuff for those who want to splurge.  Margaritas are a little on the sweet side, service can be a bit slow, and this place can be a zoo around 7pm.  If you're willing to put this aside for some decent Mexican Food in the South Park area, Paco's Tacos is your place!  FYI-Bar is great for a date or hanging out with friends or by yourself, while the rest of the restaurant is family friendly."}
{"text":"Great Mexican. Clinton is a fantastic waiter. Knowledgable about food allergies!  Fantastic"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! The jalapeño margarita is insanely good. They have some healthy options and they have both white or yellow queso depending on your preference which is nice. Found my new marg spot! Great service and nice patio! We were able to sit outside but still see he TVs during a football game."}
{"text":"In CLT for the GAMECOCKS vs NC State; met a couple that are a couple, good Friends of Life, Many Moons, Howl @ The Moon, Tall-Tales, and Adult Libations at 1145 AM....Menu similar if one has been on the Pacific Coast of Mexico \"Americano got the Sleepy Eyes\", Ahhhh \"Yes please\"....a cold Pacifico Cerveza, Shrimp Tacos/Sliced Cabbage/Pico de Gallo and a pre-celebratory shot....chilled \"Casamigos Gold\"...Damn tasty and smooth....We returned after Da-Game for dinner....Smoked jalapenos wrapped in bacon (Have to keep my Infidel Status current), a platter of \"Ambushed Shrimp\" shared with my Lady by my side, several tasty margaritas....Staff was friendly and constantly greeted with a Smile !!!!  By the Way.....GAMECOCKS WON; just saying......."}
{"text":"We got guacamole to start and the had a taco salad and enchilada for lunch. The food is good for Tex Mex, but nothing too special.  It wasn't too crowded for lunch, so it was easy to get a table to relax before shopping at South Park Mall."}
{"text":"I forgot I came here years ago, didn't think it was all that. Came back and even years later food not that good. A very poor take on Mexican food. Not even close, but at least they don't pretend to be a Mexican joint."}
{"text":"If you can get a table the food isn't bad...nothing great...average and certainly acceptable. On several  times (usually Friday -Sunday) my family has strolled in for a casual dinner to find a 45 to 60 minute wait. Frustrating and certainly not worth it."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite. Not the best taco's I've had in my life, but everything there is well above average. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great homemade margaritas! Have gone back twice since I first went. Gets better each time."}
{"text":"Delicious! I went with a big group and everyone was very satisfied with their food. We had a bit of a wait due to being with a large group so we sat at the bar and had some margaritas. I would recommend sticking with what you know. I ordered the cucumber margarita thinking it would be refreshing but it had a little too much cucumber flavor and pieces (kind of chunky..yuck). I then ordered the classic and it was too sweet and had too much mixer so if you don't like sweet, let them know before they make it! Drinks may have not been the best but the food was phenomenol. I recommend the combination platter becuase you get a little bit of everything! The tortillas are the best item hands down.If you get tacos, make sure to get soft tacos!! All of the food was delicious, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Pacos Tacos never disappoints! The portions are huge enough to feed a small army. Ha! You gotta try the margarita! They have a lively bunch crew & not bad to look at. Don't fill up on the chips & salsa"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great plenty of food. We found this when we were in charlotte. One time on way back from up North this was the place we thought of. We will return often."}
{"text":"Very big fan of the food & service is fairly good for Charlotte. Always packed at lunch which tells the story... My issue is the drinks are exceptionally weak.. You wonder if they even put tequila in the margaritas."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of tex mex but this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"Paco's Tacos, like most Mexican restaurants, brings you out a big bowl of chips and salsa to start with.  This is great, but unfortunately the salsa tastes like marinara sauce spiked with hot sauce..  We tried the No Name Margarita and another one which I forget the name, but it was fruity with some orange flavor.  We honestly did not like either flavors but they were definitely strong.  The homemade guacamole is pretty good and we ordered quesedillas which were good as well, but the food came out much too quickly.  If we wanted fast food we would have gone to taco bell!  We were hardly able to enjoy the chips and drinks before they brought our meals out.  Overall I really don't recommend, there are much better Mexican places out there!"}
{"text":"Went here when I was 39 weeks pregnant for a lunch date. I have been obsessed with all food Mexican for the past several months and am all about good Tex-Mex.  atmosphere was good, lunch crowd was busy but not overwhelming. Our server went over the specials and I decided on two tacos.  One was shredded pork and the other was chicken and they were both very good.  Nothing outstanding..... I would be open to trying a margarita there and another more authentic dish."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Paco's for a while. After Reading all of the great reviews for months we finally made it. Tucked away in South Park, the area the restaurant is in very cool.   The service was very friendly, lots of smiles which always makes the meal taste a little better in my opinion.   We ordered their drink specials. A rusty el Camino and a peach margarita. Both were lovely. the el Camino was really good.   I ordered the fajitas. the portion was smaller than I expected, but the steak was good. I left full. My wife ordered the tacos al pastor. It wasn't what we expected. But I believe the place is Tex-Mex. The meat was pulled pork. A nod to the geography, I guess. The taste was good, but my wife said she bit into fat a few times which turned her off.   Overall, the place is cool if you are looking for Mexican food in South Park."}
{"text":"Mexican food especially Tex-Mex is my absolute favorite. I have traveled all over the country and even Mexico to find some of the best tasting Mexican food. Paco's Tacos is by far one of the best places in the country. I truly recommend you make the effort to try this delicious food"}
{"text":"Love pacos! The service is great and the food is delicious! They have a great variety of tacos from your regular chicken to pastor. The pastor is definitely my favorite along with the carne Asada. I also love their rice here so I always ask for that as my side. If you visit you must try the margaritas! Can't go wrong with Tequila and Tacos!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy whenever we go. We went on a Wednesday night and we got sat right away but it was def packed. The salsa here is delicious its got a hint of spice in it which is great since it is not plain. They had good drink specials, tonight it was $3 Mexican beers. I got the enchiladas and they were so good. There was 3 of them and super filling. My friends got the small salad and it was huge too. Our waitress was very sweet and very attentive. The prices are a little more than traditional Mexican restraunts but with the amount of food we got it was worth it. Great tex Mex place to go."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here l've never had a bad meal. I especially love the Smokey & the Brisket taco, along with the skirt steak taco. The taste isn't of a fast food mexican joint rather of a  gourmet tex-mex spot in either mexico or texas.  Pacos Taco & Tequila is a step outta the box."}
{"text":"This place is located across from South Park mall in a mini shopping center. Upon entering I was greeted immediately and seated within 10 minutes.  We were sat at a booth and offered water upon being sat. The waitress came and shared the menu. but only highlighted the blood orange margarita drink. She didn't ask what we liked or typically drink to get a recommendations and I'm not a blood orange fan.  We placed our order of margaritas.The house sour has a unique taste to it. Didn't quite like it and I recommend asking to taste it before you place your order. The light margarita drink was clear and crisp and I don't typically drink light drinks but this was good and tasted way better then the one with the sour mix. Many of the drinks are made with the house sour mix. I got the tacos- chicken and shrimp which were tasty. The rice was stick, but I liked the refried beans I was nice to dip my chips in. The price was good for what was paid.  It's a nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"I know a ton of people have been here already,  but I just got had my experiece recently for my birthday.  It's not #1 on my list because it's far out, but definitely worth the drive and time.   First, I'll say I love a good margerita, a different flavored margarita (apparently from my previous review at Verde). They had a Honeydew Margarita. Pretty good. Not enough Honeydew flavor, but the alcohol content was on point. :)   Food was very satisfying. My girlfriends and I got the combination item - 1 Taco, 1 Quesidilla,and 1 Burrito. Great section of everything plus you got both rice and beans. Everything was very tasty. I got a a chicken burrito and taco and beef burrito. I'm partial to burritos mainly because I like the sauce. This one proved to be worthy,  as well. Our table also got a Guacamole and Cheese dip to share. Nothing fancy or overly superior in taste, but always a good addition when you go Mexican.   I liked that the location wasn't overall crowded either. Very steady for a week night but still space to sit with no wait. Only reason for a 4 was location being too far out and the margarita wasnt that sweet. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Brisket tacos - not to be missed. El Dorado Margarita is fresh and tasty. The only downside to Paco's is that it's pricey. It's worth it once in a while, but can't be an every week kind of a place. It's hard to find - behind Williams Sonoma in the shopping center across from South Park Mall. LOVE this place - feels like Austin, TX at a tacky BBQ joint but has great mexican food."}
{"text":"I have been to Paco's Tacos several times so I must say I was a bit disappointed with my meal on Saturday.  Overall the taste was just OK and there was a hair in my food.  The salsa was smokier than normal and overall I thought that flavor was just blah.  My server was excellent though, and I enjoyed a Mango Margarita on the rocks which was delish.  We got there at 5:30 and by 6 it was packed and VERY loud.    I will go back again and hope this was just an off night for the cook."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the four star rating after 300+ reviews! I was, and again reminded that the rating doesn't always guarantee good food! I knew the moment that I pulled in to the outdoor, upscale shopping center, that this was going to be a typical chain Mexican cuisine with inflated prices. Yes it's like walking into a Chili's with Mexican decor! The margarita special of the night had no tequila in it, and it was so tart and sweet that we kept pouring water in it to dilute it! The Chicken and Steak Fajitas combo we ordered to share was delivered with skeptic looks from us. For $19 I was expecting even more than you'd get from your favorite American Mexican spot! Well it was more like a 1/3 of that amount with a separate plate with a dab of sour cream, guacamole, shredded cheese, tomatoes, and a couple of shredded lettuce particles! Despite the overpriced incredibly small portion size of this dish, the skirt steak was really good and equally impressive was the tender chicken breast slices! Despite the quality of the two meats, they tasted like anything you'd get from Applebee's or Chili's. The rice, charro beans, tomatoes, guacamole, and cheese were all just bland. The one highlight though is the house made tortillas! These are phenomenal and straight out of some street vendor in San Diego! Perhaps I'm spoiled now? Perhaps I'm just over these mall style Mexican restaurants with their weak $12 margaritas? Or perhaps we should just expect better? You could certainly do worse than Paco's Tacos, but you could pay half that and find something way better in the ever more available taquerias that dot every city's landscape!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch when all the breakfast places were packed on Sunday and was not disappointed. The cucumber jalapeno margarita was the best margarita I've ever had, super refreshing. The queso with pineapple was unique and awesome. I also had the shrimp and fish tacos and they were cooked and seasoned well. Highly recommend, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"These were the most amazing tacos!! I love the fact you can mix and match which your tacos. Now lets talk margaritas... Holy Tequila!! I imagine you can't go wrong with any choice, the tequila menu is so large, I don't know how to choose, but all I can say is YUMMO!!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best tex mex in Charlotte, NC. We don't have a lot of great Mexican restaurant around but if someone was to ask me where I want to eat for Mexican food... I would either suggest Paco's Tacos or Sabor Latin Street.   I have sampled a few of the tacos and they're all pretty delish. If your not as hungry I would suggest ordering the chicken tortilla soup bowl. It's perfect for cold nights and it will fill you up for only $5. We also tried a jalapeno shot. Please do yourself a favor and don't try it thinking it's cool or something. We tried it and I felt like there was a goldfish inside my stomach instantly... No bueno. Other than that everything is pretty awesome not the mention the service and the lovely dim light atmosphere. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food- some of the best Tex Mex I  have ever eaten.  Restaurant was about 3/4 full, which is not bad for a Monday! We were seated immediately and the service was great! The portions were huge. So many things on the menu looked really good-I had the steak fajitas and they were delicious, the flour tortillas are made on site. Definitely will be going again!"}
{"text":"Popped into this joint one afternoon to watch some of the world cup and eat tacos. We tried a variety of their offerings from cerviche to various types of tacos. No complaints there. Food was average and everyone seemed happy with what they ordered.   My biggest complaint would be that I tried to order 3-4 different drinks off their drink menu, and each time the waiter returned a few minutes later to tell me their did not have the ingredients to make it. Not being able to make a mojito or margarita in a mexican restaurant seems kinda odd.. Especially during the world cup games when business should be booming."}
{"text":"I live about 2 mi. from this spot and have never been there, but man, am I happy I found this hole in a soft shell.  If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this isn't it, but if you're in the mood for Tex-Mex, this was awesome. When we sat down our server stopped by to let us know she was a bit busy, but she knew we were there and she was coming right over! Sometimes a little bit of expectation setting can go a long way. We had the white cheese dip. The dip had the white cheese flavor you would expect, but a bit more salty and creamy. I had fish tacos and they were AWESOME! My husband had the shrimp tacos and they were loaded with small shrimp and he said it was very filling. The atmosphere was great, the service super friendly and quick and I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Literally the BEST salsa I've ever had!!  Sat at the bar  - great attentive service.  Lots of choices on menu - but I could have just eaten chips and salsa for dinner!  (:"}
{"text":"So we made reservations and when we got there, the line was out the door. We waited for a few minutes at the front door. It was very uncomfortable as it was humid and there was a stench coming from somewhere? They brought us around to the back side in front of the window. That was great. But it was evident that we weren't going to get served anytime soon. Our waitress went to every table around us, including a couple that was seated 5 minutes after us???? I was calm as I wanted to have a nice evening. But I really wanted to get up and leave after 15 minutes! When her mood ring changed the right color for her to serve our table, I ordered a strawberry rita on the rocks. Way to sweet. Move on to the Dennis enchiladas. Those made everything better. They had a creamy cheese sauce on top, instead of a lump of hard melted plastic. Very good and filing. The service picked up as the evening wore on, but the place was empting out as well. this would have been a four star review, but...."}
{"text":"How in the world haven't I written a review on this place!? It's one of my favorite restaurants in all of Charlotte!   Every meal starts with the chips, which most of the time are hot and fresh. They're free and come with salsa that is mild and a bit smoky. That's good on it's own, or you can get queso (my fav queso) or tableside guac.   For the main course I tend to rotate between various tacos, fajitas, or the top big taco salad. Never ordered anything I didn't like.   This place is also awesome for margs. The regular marg does you just fine, but if you're picky about your tequila, they've got so many options! They also tend to do seasonal ones and my fav so far has been a watermelon one.   If you get a chance to go during restaurant week, do it! It's a ton of food for the value. Everything listed above and maybe even a little more, all for $30 per person."}
{"text":"I've been branching out a bit here lately and decided to try Paco's for a late lunch on Saturday.  My daughter has Celiac so we have to be choosy about where we eat and Paco's has good reviews among the community of people eating in the Queen city that have allergies as a good, safe place to go.  I've been to Southpark a million times and always overlook this shopping center across the street.  Paco's is there on the side and has nice, indoor and outdoor seating.  Nice menu and the chips and salsa are wonderful and I'm pretty sure they fry them in a separate fryer so they're not comingled with wheat items.  I had 2 tacos Brisket and Shrimp and they were wonderful.  They certainly don't skimp on ingredients and the tacos were totally on point.  My daughter had the Smokey & the Brisket taco also and she really enjoyed it.  Best of all, we topped it off with $.50 ice cream for dessert.  In my situation where I enjoy eating out and have to find places that won't have my daughter puking her guts out afterwards I have grown to appreciate places like this.  Paco's will now be on our rotation for good, solid, food in Southpark!  Great job!"}
{"text":"I had a margarita.  It was delicious--although I would call it a \"East Coast\" Margarita 'cause it was a bit too sweet.  The bartender was quite friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent guacamole made table side. Their tequila mixes drinks are very unique and very delicious. It can get very crowded on the weekends and there's not much room to wait inside after the bar fills up but every time I have been there they get you seated within 20 minutes.  Wait staff is always great. They sent us home with a bag of chips and salsa to go once. Another time my boyfriend left his iPhone at the table and  the kept it for him until he got back to pick it up. Highly recommend this one"}
{"text":"Food is good and get alot of it, I did love the re fried beans that they serve. Two taco plate will fill you up for sure.   Serves was slow but it was a Friday and place was busy when we first got there, but then sorta emptied after that first dinner rush.   Best part of the whole experience was a young man that worked there Jeffery was so nice and really took to talking to our daughter. But just watching him he seemed to work so much harder then the rest of the staff and I hope he gets rewarded for the way he treats customers and his customer service."}
{"text":"Went to Pacos Tacos tonight for the first time and will surely be returning! Good food, good drinks, AMAZING service!!  CJ was fantastic! He asked if it was our first time and helped us through the menu with great picks! I had mentioned the salsa was a little spicy and without missing a beat he brought out another salsa for us. He was honest and helped us decide on our orders and was very attentive and super funny! CJ alone was enough to get us to come back every week! Everyone else on the staff was great, refilling waters at other tables and bringing out more chips.  I can't say anything negative about this restaurant! The only downside was that we filled up on chips and dip and hardly touched our dinner!!"}
{"text":"Tried Pacos today after visiting the mall. It was so-so.   The goods: Flour tortillas, chips and salsa, guacamole, and the steak taco.   The tortillas were soft and warm, the salsa perfectly spicy, chips were warm (but a little too salty), guac tastes yummy, and the steak was cooked perfect.   The bads: Chicken taco, drink \"specials\", price, wait, beans, and rice.   The chicken was bland, drinks were over priced and watered down, pricing for two tacos and boxed rice/canned beans is $11 (way too much), watched many tables get turned away but we were seated immediately at an open table, and there were many... I don't understand their seating here it seems strange.   The averages:  Service - somewhat lacking, she was never close by nor did she check on us often enough. I didn't like my drink, and she never asked about the full glass, but happily put the extra $11 on my tab.   The lowdown, this place is okay, not authentic Mexican food, not terrible, but not worth the price. I dunno, we might we return. We might not."}
{"text":"My family discovered Paco's not long after moving to Charlotte six years ago, and it's still our favorite Tex-Mex restaurant by a mile. The tacos are absolutely wonderful, particularly the beef brisket Paco's and the Wood Grilled Chicken, which come in flavorful orders of two or three. The Chimichanga and Enchiladas are also excellent, and the chips always crisp and delicious.   Every Mexican restaurant lives or dies by its margaritas, and Paco's serves up some of the best in town. My favorite is the El Dorado, now off the menu but still available by request. Service is also friendly and prompt, and the environment is fun and kid-friendly. For my money, Paco's is the best game in town if you're craving Tex-Mex in the Queen City."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. However, the bacon wrapped shrimp was a bummer. I'm not sure how you create a dish like that and it taste sub par, but they did. It was greasy and some of the bacon wasn't cooked well... leaving it chewy and raw. Mojito was just ok. My man ordered nachos as an entrée and the plate was literally half empty when she brought it. We both looked at it and wondered \"where's the rest??\" Disappointed. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but the moment our server sashayed with my sizzling platter of fajitas, and all heads turned to the sound and aroma of seasoned steak, I knew I made the right choice coming here.  The Outlaw Steak Fajita I had was very satisfying and are bursting with flavor. It was served with red rice, pico de gallo, and warm homemade four tortillas.  Daily specials: - Mon: $8 Espolon Resposado Margarita * $3 Beer cans. - Tues: $3 NC Pints * $5 No Name Margaritas. - Wed: $3 Mexican Bottles. - Thur: $2 Shiner Bock Pints * $10 Top Shelf Herradura Anejo Margaritas. - Fri: $9 Rusty El Caminos * Friday Night Flights. - Sat: $9 Ace's High Margaritas. - Sun: $3 OMB Pints * Half Price Bottles of Wine.  Three and Half Yelps"}
{"text":"Excellent choice, fresh made ingredients,  chips and salsa were excellent. I had wood grilled chicken taco. Very good people was filling along with the rice, beans and cole slaw . Everyone gave it a thumbs up...excellent food and great service. Look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night and the place was quite busy.  We sat at the bar and had a margarita.  I tried the Artic Margarita which is an $8 special on Friday nights (usually $12).  That's nice it's a special for $8 because I really don't think any mixed drink is worth $12 - unless it straight up. The Artic Margarita is good.  I also had the watermelon margarita with a muddled jalapeno. One of the guys had the really peppery margarita which in a way was good but you'd better like spicy.  I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers - the chips are the best!  and the red and green salsa are great as well.  I went for the 2 taco dish ($10 - can't beat that).  I ordered the grilled white fish taco and the skirt steak taco.  Plenty of food and delicious.  Everything looks and tastes fresh.  Everyone at the table really enjoyed their meal.  I did notice that there was a kids menu, so we will definetly be coming back with the kids as well.  One thing I did notice was that the bar scene didn't seem very active.  We left about 9:45p on a Friday night and the place was empty.  Seemed that people just come to eat.  Though they have an extensive margarita menu and a full bar."}
{"text":"Hmm...I really believe this is a 4+ star place, but not everyone is sharing my love for Pacos.  I was graciously invited to check out the place a while back and glad I did. The funny thing is I thought Manzetti's was still at that location?  I bumped into some folks from work, so this place is popular and even met a local micro-brewer from the Coast having some of his beers being tried out at the place that evening so a good time was had by all.  Tucked away near South Park Mall, Pacos is a great little place with some awesome selection of tequila, great guacamole, and a menu that I look forward to trying throughout 2011.  There are specials, but so far I've just ordered off the menu.  The bar is long and the table plenty, plus in the warmer months there is a patio...for which I don't think Charlotte has nearly enough of them.  Texas BBQ is good...and I also like Mexican, but Pacos is the best Tex Mex in these parts hands down."}
{"text":"Their queso and chips are amazing. They also have one of the best margaritas in Charlotte (margarita with no name). I'm sure all of their food is great but I order the enchiladas de Dennis every time."}
{"text":"LOVE Pacos but it's a little disappointing that they don't take big parties. Had a party of 14 and wanted to make a reservation but was told they don't take reservations for large parties from 5:30-8:30pm. Even offered not to necessarily sit together and was told they could not honor our request, the lady I spoke with wasn't the nicest about the situation either. We took our business to a nearby Mexican restaurant who gladly made a reservation."}
{"text":"I attended a conference at the Marriott for two days and ate lunch here both days a few months ago. As a creature of habit I sat and the bar and ordered the same thing. Tacos and chopped salad. Both were flavorful and fresh. The customer service is great, just enough attentiveness although they are busy. I would return 100x if I lived closer!"}
{"text":"The guacamole and queso dip for the chips was delicious. Nice beverage menu and the steak quesadilla was pretty good."}
{"text":"Ever met those people that try and convince you they are more interesting than they are, that's pacos and everyone who raves about it. Friendly service  decent atmosphere but dang there food is just \"eh\". I have been numerous times and it is no better than Any other Mexican Place you have ever been. Remember that time you thought that you would try that Mexican Place off the beaten path near the airport where the hobos hung out front and it ended up keeping you up all night.... that's pretty much how pacos taste,   Sorry south park diehards but this isn't good food"}
{"text":"Pacos tacos and tequila has really great food I always wait two hours to get a table when I go so I decided to make a reservation on open table and when I got there ten minutes early my table was not ready and I was told to wait I waited for about twenty minutes and I still wasn't seated so i left and I was texted about an hour later that my table was ready by that time I was home. So rude."}
{"text":"Pack Taco Beef Brisket is a must! Drinks are very good too!! Went back later in the week for Restaurant Week. Again, the menu didn't let me down. Drinks are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Love this place. New go-to Mexican in the South Park area...   If you are into spice, the Cucumber Jalapeno Margarita is amazing!! It is a little bit of spicy overload (even for me) with the chips and salsa but I LOVE IT.  The food is extremely fresh! I recommend getting the guacamole & fajitas and sharing with a friend :)"}
{"text":"Can you say once you've tried one Mexican restaurant, you've tried them all? Eh...kind of.  My experience here was no different than other one I've been to.  The food came in large portions (like normal), you get your chips and salsa (like normal) and you'll leave thinking, \"Yeah, that was decent Mexican food.\"  I will say that our server was great.  You rock Elisha!"}
{"text":"Food was actually great but bartender was miserable.  I sat at bar for dinner, asked for skinny margarita w/salt (which tnose are sour), hot a super sweet one with no salt.  When I asked for her to fix it so its sour ( maybe more lime juice?l she insisted on sour mix (then it's not skinny) and now it was a big deal.  Ok, let me tell you the skinny has no sugar in it, what ever you did it was either wrong or too much.  Other bartender came over and remade it and took my dinner order.  I thought she was taking over, but alas not. Ot was the blonde bartender with crap attitude. No follow up, no hoes your dinner, no want another drink or dessert, ignored.   Hope management reads this. Ruined what could have been a nice dinner for this business traveler.   Moral here is if they know you're not coming back cause you're \"not from here \" they dont give toss. Paid bill and left with NO words exchanged, no thank you, no screw you.   I did nothing to deserve this other than request a drink that I thought was made incorrectly.    Girl, bye."}
{"text":"After living in Texas for five years, I'm extremely picky about Tex Mex. This place is LEGIT. It's the closest thing to real Tex Mex I've found in the Carolinas. It's the only place I've found here that has charro beans. The tacos are outstanding and I love the cheese enchiladas. I highly recommend it. It's one of my favorite restaurants of any kind in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday night with my wife and daughter.  There was about a 20 minute wait.  The server brought the chips and salsa right away. The tomatillo salsa was very good. The service throughout the meal was excellent. The water glasses were constantly filled and the server came by about four times.  The hostess also stopped by. I shared the steak fajitas with my daughter and the meat was cooked just right and the vegetables were good too   My wife had the carnitas and was happy with her meal.  Overall, it was an enjoyable evening and we will return. Not to leave out that the value was good too."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of Tex-Mex, but their Taco's here are fantastic.  As busy as it was, we were seated quickly, had great service, and delicious food.  The shrimp tacos there are particularly tasty."}
{"text":"I have been craving taco so much and I must say that the taco is to die for! You must get some. I had smokey the brisket and chicken milenesa. I was able to substitute the rice and beans for BBQ corn and French fries. Before my meal even came we had about four baskets of chips and salsa! So be careful and don't eat too much of those because you would want to save some room for your tummy. The waiter was super nice and always checked up on us. One of my friends ordered a meal but didn't know there was going to be beans in them and was willing to continue to eat it! The waiter overheard and said shed be glad to remake one without beans! Even thought my friend didn't take the offer, it just showed how incredible the service was. The tacos was so flavorful and filling. You don't think two would fill you up but it will! Just make sure you squeeze some like on the tacos to give it an extra flavor."}
{"text":"Quite possibly our favorite restaurant in charlotte. I usually always get the tacos and my boyfriend gets the fajitas. Normally we like to branch out but our favorites there are so good we don't dare stray... I would absolutely more than recommend this to anyone and everyone! Their margaritas are deliiiiiishhhhhh as well!"}
{"text":"Another great restaurant from FS Food Group. The service staff is knowledgeable, helpful and caring about all aspects of service. The tacos are amazing of course but if you are looking for a real treat try the ambush shrimp or shrimp diablo. I pound of shrimp on one and bacon wrapped shrimp on the other how can you go wrong. They are starting to do daily specials on drinks and food always prepared by the well trained bartenders and chefs. So if you are looking for great tex- mex come try this little gem"}
{"text":"After having heard many great things about Paco's, we were very excited to try it. Since moving to Charlotte from Texas several years ago, we have not found a true Tex-Mex place that comes close to the real thing. Paco's comes close, but it's got way too much \"Carolina flavor\" thrown in to truly call it Tex-Mex, or even Mexican, for that matter.  We went on a Friday night. Made an Open Table reservation through Yelp on the same day - super easy and convenient. When we arrived, we were seated right away at a nice window table. My 8-year old was thrilled with the kids' menu/crayon combo, and my hubby and I ordered margaritas and some guacamole to get settled in.  We made the mistake of ordering the Cadillac Margaritas, which were bright blue and way too sweet (they were on special, so we thought we'd try it). Their traditional margarita on the rocks was MUCH better!  Hands down, the BEST part of the meal was the table-side guacamole. Our waiter was enthusiastic about this, and it did not disappoint. He mixed up the guac to our specifications (chunky or smooth? spicy or not spicy?). It was perfectly seasoned and yummy to the last bite. I would go back JUST for the guacamole, it was that good.  Entrees: I am a fish taco fanatic, so I had to order the fish taco. I also got the brisket taco, upon recommendation by our waiter. My hubby ordered the steak burrito. Our son ordered the cheese quesadilla. The food arrived quickly, and was fresh and hot upon the drop. My husband loved his burrito. It was huge! The steak was tender and nicely seasoned. The burrito had a sour cream queso on top, not my hubby's cuppa tea, but he poured some of their house made salsa over it and was happy. My fish taco was supremely good - from the homemade flour tortillas to the crunchy, slightly spicy fried fish (you can also order grilled fish) and creamy slaw topping. I was very happy with this item.  The brisket taco was... weird. As I mentioned, I moved here from Texas where brisket is king. So I had pretty high expectations of the brisket. I was surprised to taste something sweet in my brisket, and it was NOT a pleasant surprise. There were caramelized onions in it, and a chipotle BBQ sauce, which made the whole experience overly sticky-sweet and ruined the brisket, in my opinion. I realize that here in the Carolinas, this sort of sweetness in a savory dish is popular, so I figured the chef wanted to appeal to the regional tastebuds. I wouldn't order the brisket taco again, though. But that's because there are several other items on the menu I plan to try! My son's cheese quesadilla was as expected - my little picky eater was pleased and happily gobbled it up.  Dessert: We were stuffed, but we ordered a Trés Leches cake to go. It was perfection, even a day later after sitting in a plastic container overnight. I highly recommend you try this dessert! It's the real deal. The peanut butter chocolate pie was tempting, too.   Service and aesthetic were both excellent. The tables were a little close, and the restaurant was somewhat noisy, but that only adds to the experience.   All in all, while we did not find \"the one\" we've been in search of, but we were pleased and will return. My husband still favors Cantina 1511 over Paco's, but I would have to say the guacamole was so good that I would go to Paco's over Cantina any day of the week. : )  If you're in the SouthPark area, and craving Mexican, you won't be disappointed in Paco's. Just be sure to read the product descriptions so you're not surprised when your food/drinks arrive!"}
{"text":"Always yummy. Crowded when we came so we had to sit at a high top bar table. My suggestion would be to turn down the air a little. We were freezing! They also need seats with backs on them to be more comfortable. Our food was delicious however!"}
{"text":"My party had a reservation and we were seated immediately. This place is good! I ordered the fiesta bowl and it was huge! I could only eat half and had to take the rest home (always a plus). The waitress was really nice and accommodating.  My friend ordered 3 tacos and she couldn't finish them. The serving sizes are huge. This place also has daily drink specials, but we did not order drinks. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was next door at the barre studio when someone brought in a salad with chicken that smelled amazing. I've been to Paco's 3 times to try each of their salads and all of them were great but my favorite is the chopped salad with beef brisket. The service is great with service from not only the server but a few others to refill drinks, chips, salsa, etc. and the manager coming by to make sure everything is up to our standards. Conveniently located across the mall, this will be added to the rotation of places to eat after some holiday shopping!"}
{"text":"I can't even think of an adjective to describe how yummy Paco's is!  I ordered the 2 taco combo and the shrimp and chicken were equally delicious.  All of the food was so FRESH! The portions were huge and our server was so attentive and nice.  And their margaritas? I could have stayed in my booth all day drinking their margaritas and eating the chips and salsa.  DEFINITELY give this place a try - I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best vege fajitas anywhere.  Wife says the hand made wheat tortillas are the best she's ever had.   The complimentary chips and salsa are fantastic.    I feel sad I can't eat ALL of it!  It's just too much food!!"}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner experience was just OK and did not start out well.   We called ahead for directions and were told it was in SouthPark, next to Crate & Barrel. For those who have been there, you know, as we do now, this is not at all where they're located. They're across the street from the mall, behind Williams & Sonoma. We were 10 minutes late to meet our dinner companions as we drove around the mall completely confused. A text from our friends got us back on track.  When calling ahead, we also added our name to the call-ahead seating list, even though they weren't on a wait at the time. We thought they might be by the time we got there 20 minutes later on a Saturday evening, which they were. Our friends, who'd arrived before us, asked if our names were on the list. They were told no, given a pager, and told the wait would be 10-15 minutes. When we arrived, the hostesses were not welcoming or friendly. We asked again about our name being on the list, and lo and behold, they found it. They gave us a new pager. 25 minutes later, after seeing numerous other parties seated, we were seated by another unfriendly hostess.  Sitting two tables away from the large glass windows, there was such a cold draft, I ended up putting my coat back on. I was grateful we weren't seated in the booth right up against the window. However, my table seat location right next to the aforementioned booth, meant the server's & guacamole maker's butts were right in my face when they were waiting on that booth. Ugh.  Tonight's saving grace: our server, Jim. He was on top of things. He was quick to take our order, quick with the drink & chip refills. And when he noticed my husband's chili had come with cheese on it, despite the request for none, he promptly delivered a corrected version (albeit then it was missing the scallions also).  The tableside guacamole is a nice trend I've seen in several restaurants. Paco's is just OK. It was pretty salty but lacking in much other flavor. All four of us felt the same way about that. For the price, I expected better.  Soups and fajitas were good and flavorful. Margarita was OK but overpriced in my opinion. The guys liked both their beers and thought the price was reasonable. (If we go back, I guess I know what drink I'll be getting instead!)  The menu said something about a $2 split-plate charge, which I find rather silly. We're getting the same exact meal, right? We didn't even get an extra plate. What are we paying the extra fee for? Lucky for us, our bill did not include that, which we sheepishly did not point out to our server. (Now if I find out split plates are indeed more generous portions, then I understand the additional fee!)  For the price we paid for this Saturday night out meal, (thank goodness for a $10 coupon!), I expected more from the experience."}
{"text":"Love eating here! We have been a few times and have never been let down. I love the Enchiladas de Dennis, if you are looking for a recommendation.  Mostly, though, I love the knowledgeable staff. Each time I have gone I have tried a new drink and they have been able to offer a great break down of tequila varieties and what may suit my dish or my mood.  Very kind and attentive, every time."}
{"text":"I will start of with saying I am not a huge fan of soft tacos, but these tacos were REALLY good! I was worried that the two taco meal wouldn't be enough to fill me up, but boy was I wrong. I was really hungry and I could only get through one taco with the rice and beans. The beef brisket is PHENOMENAL and coupled with the homemade coleslaw and sauce made for a perfect, flavorful combination. My husband had a burrito, which was also a large and satisfying portion!  If you're in the mood for flavorful street tacos and other Mexican cuisine, I would give this place a try!"}
{"text":"YUM.  Paco's has been on my list for a very long time.  Got to check it out the other day and it lived up to my self-created hype about it!  Tried their queso which was steaming hot (it a good way!).....   went well with their chips and salsa.  Ordered a Calamari Taco and a Paco's Taco and both were delicious.  The tacos come with beans, rice and a slaw salad.  It was a lot of food for a decent price.  I'd like to come back to try their larger specials and margaritas.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Waters always refilled and chips and salsa kept coming!  A good experience."}
{"text":"I haven't had the best of luck lately with Mexican places but I was craving it tonight and decided to try someplace new again and ended up here.  Everything surprised me here.  With the chips and salsa, normally the red salsa is the spicy one.  At Paco's, the tomatillo salsa is the spicier of the two.   The chips were kind of average though.    I had trouble deciding on a margarita so I went with the Firestarter which contains jalepeno-infused tequila and ginger beer.  That was actually the spiciest thing I had tonight which wasn't a bad thing. It just caught me by surprise.    I ordered my meal (Paco's Tacos) and I swear two minutes later it was sitting on my table.  What surprised me about this is the sweet sauce on the tacos which was a nice contrast to the spiciness of the salsa and the margarita.  It also came with Chacco beans, rice, and a slaw.   Considering I am not a big beans and rice person, the rice has to be good for me to finish all of it -- and it was.  For dessert I tried the Tres Leches cake which came out beautifully presentted and well it didn't go away the beautifully but it was gone by the time I left.  All in All, Paco's is a nice surprise.  Prices are decent, the service is excellent and the food is wonderful.  This is definitely worth coming back to!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love visiting this place. The food is super yum and fresh and their salsa is one of the best I've had in Charlotte.  I love their choice of drinks and my personal favourite is the jalapeno one. The staff is friendly and helpful. THeir suggestions with respect to food and drinks always proved to be nice. Every meal starts with complimentary chips and salsa and you get to choose from their list of tacos, quesadilla, burrito (both bowls and wrap) and fajitas. The menu is that of any mexican restaurant, but the flavours are really fresh and definitely mouth watering.  I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves mexican food or wants to try it out for the first time. THe price is a little bit on the higher side, but I'm not complaining , since it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm starting to look something like a foodie. It's Queen's Feast aka Charlotte Restaurant Week and I had to try it out. The reason I give it 4 stars is because we still had to wait an extra 30 minutes for our 8:30 reservation to get seated. The best part was our waiter Jake who took very great care of us. He went through the entire menu with us and took the time explain what is what. It's $30 for a 4 course meals including a margarita so go before it's over. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"As a native Texan, we were anxiously awaiting authentic Tex-Mex in Charlotte, and if anyone could do it right, it would be Frank Scibelli.  Overall it was very good.   Just a few things that could be tweaked - the salsa wasn't quite as good as the salsa at Cantina 1511, and the chip basket needs to be bigger (Texans love their chips and salsa),   there should be some frozen margaritas on the menu, and please add some more draft beer choices.  While I love Shiner and Dos Equis, Lonestar and Pearl are welcome favorites too.  The service was excellent! We look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and had a great meal. Chips and salsa were really good. We tried a bunch of different tacos and were pleasantly surprised. If your a tequila fan this is the place for you. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Had great service. Absolutely delicious food. Got an order of three different tacos  only got to try two: skirt steak and al pastor. Fantastic. Will 100% return here."}
{"text":"Had business lunch here today and I absolutely loved it. The place was tucked away and not super loud, decor was cool, staff was attentive and friendly.  Best of all the food was great, my turkey taco was amazing, the server recommended the brisket taco which was good...But I could have ate three more of the turkey taco's.  The guacamole was way better than average.  Think I find my new favorite Mexican place."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is always lacking.  35 minutes wait time for lunch is unacceptable especially when you only have an hour for lunch."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the place to get delicious, reasonably priced Mexican food with AMAZING service, this is it. Every single time I have ever been to Pacos Taco, I have been blown away. Their margaritas are incredible with tons of variety and seasonal specials. Their tacos are out of this world delicious, and I personally love the Shake Down Shrimp tacos. Their guacamole is delicious and you can have it made any way you like. Every time I order the special, I'm happy I did, whatever it may be, and while I don't really believe in ordering salads in places like this, their salads are amazing as well.  My husband and I work in South Park and this is our number one preferred lunch spot because we are always in and out in under thirty minutes, which is pretty amazing!  The service has never ever disappointed us and we always feel as though the wait staff goes above and beyond to keep their guests happy.  The only downside? I never have leftovers because the food is SO delicious that I scarf it down in one sitting!!! I wish I could post a picture on here of my meals, but again, I scarf it down so fast, that's not something I think about until I'm done...  Pacos, please don't ever change!! You guys are awesome. We will be loyal repeat customers whether we live and work close-by, or happen to move far away!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Probably the best Mexican I've had in Charlotte so far! My friend wanted to go here as it's her fav Mexican place in Charlotte and I can easily see why! From the chips and salsa to the margaritas to the queso, the tacos, to their homemade flour tortillas! Everything was excellent. I was iffy about it at first being a tex mex restaurant but my friend knows my love for Mexican and I trusted her opinion. I'm glad We came because now this is easily my favorite Mexican here! I tried 3 different tacos and each was excellent! They are also huge portions of tacos so beware that your stomach is as big as your eyes! I got the cucumber jalapeño margarita and it was amazing as well, very refreshing! The service was also excellent! Our waitress was on top of drink and chip refills with no hesitation! I already can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, from the ambiance, to the service and the food. We first came here during restaurant week and loved it. We came back tonight and ended up sitting in Emma's section (she was our server the first time also) she's awesome, knowledgable and very nice. Anytime we have asked for recommendations she's been able to give us one. The guacamole is DELICIOUS, fresh and made at the table. Bring your appetite because you get a lot and guarantee to take something home. Even the kids fries are good."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good size portions. The brisket was the best. Great music selection. I will definitely be back. Happy hour has 3$ IPA's. That's all I needed to hear to give it a shot."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp tacos on a wheat tortilla and the chicken tacos on a corn tortilla. The wheat tortilla held so much better, and I absolutely loved the shrimp tacos. They were crispy and warm. Their waitress was nice! My friend and I went of a Monday night and didn't wait at all. Would highly recommend... only suggestion would be more outdoor seating! I only saw four tables from where I was sitting (right behind the host stand), which were full. Other than that, I am certainly coming back."}
{"text":"The tacos are great! Quest blanco con chile is also a great choice. My hubby got the PacoTaco with shredded pork, said it was amazing. I had the grilled fish taco on whole wheat tortilla-- it was also delicious. The serving sizes are very generous, they have great deals and if you buy drinks it shakes out to about $15 pp. it's located in an adorable shopping center, so take a walk when you finish eating. I think this places beats out Chuy's up the street."}
{"text":"Originally my first choice was extremely packed and after reading some of the great  reviews here I had to give it a chance.  The food, location and service were great and I will HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone that's looking for some great food at a good price. The staff was friendly, my waiter was very helpful and although they were busy, they kept things moving and while keeping an eye on everybody. Plus, the food was delicious (had the fish tacos and chips with queso) and also I enjoy the fact you could to a reservation online as well (left my first choice at 830, set appointment online for 9pm, got there and check in at 845pm and by text I was informed two minutes later they had a table) so I was happy my second choice was a superb option.   Now, with this fantastic review you will be wondering why it didn't get the 5 stars and it's only because I was told to removed my hat. Honestly, if I'm there to eat, why does it matter if I have my hat on since it won't be bothering anyone? ***UPDATE*** MANAGEMENT READ MY REVIEW AND CONTACTED ME ABOUT THAT POLICY NOT BEING THE CASE WHICH SHOWS THEIR LEVEL OF GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I THANK THEM FOR CLEARING THAT OUT. I WAS COMING BACK BEFORE BUT NOW I CAN SAY I WILL BE BACK FOR EVEN MORE IN THE FUTURE   Anyway, that still doesn't take away it is a great place and I will be back again."}
{"text":"Maybe it is because I neither tried Paco's tacos nor his tequila but I was not enamored with this restaurant. It was an A-OK experience overall. I will say we had an excellent server considering we were a work group of 12 and basically took up a whole back corner.  I sampled several items and here is the breakdown:  Complimentary chips - yes! Warm and salty in the best way possible.  Complimentary salsa - not the worst I've had but definitely bland.  Smoked jalapeños - my favorite item of the sampling! I thought they were perfect but the more spice sensitive members of my group thought they were too much and were wishing for some milk.   Chicken tortilla soup - more broth than substance with a lot of tortilla strips. I loved the addition of avocado.   Refried beans - strange oily aftertaste.   Charro beans - I would probably order these again over the other bean options but wouldn't seek them out.  Rice (that I didn't order) - bland. I requested two bean sides with my meal instead of rice because I am not big on rice. However my meal came with rice and I sampled it because it was there. Kind of matches how I feel about rice in general.  Enchiladas de Dennis - my second favorite item sampled! Smothered with queso and stuffed with chicken and spinach I would happily order these again.  The décor is nice and the restaurant is clean but overall the food wasn't particularly memorable. Maybe I will return one day and try some of the food after having some of the tequila and will be a more enthusiastic patron."}
{"text":"My friend does some catering with them so they allowed four of us to come in and try out the restaurant before it opened.  It's in a great South Park location where Manzetti's used to be.  They started us off with chips and dip which included a warm basket of chips, hot salsa as in heated not spicy hot, and a side of pureed guac.  Everyone liked the warm salsa and guac.  For apps we had the Brisket Nachos and Bottle Caps which were a combination of deep fried pickles and jalapenos with chipolte sauce...tasty!  The nachos consisted of about 10 nachos each with a piece of brisket on top with cheese etc.  Both apps were good and priced in the $8-10 range each.  The apps portion sizes weren't huge but eveyone was able to get a taste of each.  For entrees we had the Ambushed Shrimp and Brisket Tacos.  The 9 shrimp were bacon wrapped with a cheese topping.  The entree came with slaw and rice for $18.  A tad pricey but very good!  The brisket tacos are avaiable in hard or soft shell with rice, beans, and slaw and received a thumbs up.  The tacos are approx $12.    For dessert we had one Tres Leches for the whole table.  I must say it was some of the best I've ever had.  They brought out our bill for 4 which also included 8 Dos Equis beers for a total of $122 not including tip.  Our friend took care of the bill but we left a nice tip for our great waiter.  We collectively gave it 3 stars due to the upper end pricing for tex-mex but if your looking for something a little different it's definitely worth a try :)!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. The enchilada sampler is awesome! Chips- awesome! Salsa - awesome! Waiter- awesome! Heck, even the salt around my margarita was awesome. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place every time I stop in. This past visit was a girl's night out and of course Paco's impressed again. We ordered the freshly made guacamole and it was incredible. For dinner, I ordered the Paco's Taco which is one of my favorites and the chicken taco. The sauce on the chicken taco has a bit of heat to it but it adds just enough to really enhance the flavors of the meal. We topped our meal off with a pitcher of Margaritas... which of course were amazing! Paco's has a great atmosphere and we really enjoyed our evening out."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were great!! The waitress was super nice and did her job perfectly."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Tex-Mex food! I'm a vegetarian and I was blown away by the veggie fajitas -- by far the best I've ever had! I live in NYC and I'd like to come back to NC just for those..."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Margaritas are amazing and the food is so good!  The beef brisket taco and the pork carnitas are spot on.  If you love Tex-Mex, this place is for you!  Make a reservation since they stay busy!"}
{"text":"The manager Cory reached out to me today and apologized for the poor service I recieved.  She assured me that is not the standard at their restaurants (it's a part of a group), and explained the corrective action that was taken to ensure better service next time.   She was very kind and ensured that we were happy with our experience otherwise. I look forward to trying it again in the near future and will hopefully enjoy good service to go along with the good food."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Had 3 tacos for lunch...Paco, Country Fried and Fish. I've been mouthfarting ever since. Hopefully it stops soon. In all fairness, it's my fault for ordering fish, country fried steak and taco meat. Who does that?!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were starving after traveling to Charlotte and wanted a drink and filling meal.  Paco's Tacos was located a super short distance from the Marriott South Park which was great since we didn't have a car.    I ordered the cucumber jalapeño margarita on the rocks and it was delicious.  The margarita was not too spicy and refreshing.  For an appetizer we ordered the chips and guacamole which was made table side.  The bowl was towering with chips and definitely a generous serving.  I tried not to fill up on chips but it was a challenge.    For dinner I ordered the pacos tacos which was braised brisket, grilled onion and a chipotle sauce on a corn tortilla.  Again, not too spicy and the onion was mild and didn't over power the flavor.  You have the option of picking what kind of tortilla you want and I went with corn.  You were also able to pick your beans and I def made the right decision with picking refried.  These refried beans were amazing... I wasn't expecting abnormally delicious refried beans.  They were smooth, creamy and had a very subtle kick of spice.  I loved them.  The meal came with rice which was good but I preferred to eat the beans and chips.    The service was great and I enjoyed my meal and experience."}
{"text":"Always hit this place at least once when I'm in Charlotte.  Very good food  in a laid back atmosphere.  Very friendly staff and great bartenders."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch last week with a friend  and let's just say the salsa is irresistible and full of flavor. We also ordered margaritas which were made perfectly. I ordered the wood grilled chicken taco which was stuffed with pure yumminess. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. The guacamole was delicious made at table with just enough kick. I had the Paco Taco with pulled pork. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Ok.  The Mexican food here is fairly decent for being in North Carolina.   The reason for the 1 star is to bring attention to the lame young female bartender.  With only a few people at the bar this girl really made an effort to have terrible customer service.   Walked by several times without even looking or asking if we needed anything or how was the food etc.   I usually tip 20% but this was not the case this time.  This girl needs to wake up and take care of her customers.   It's a shame but the owner / manager needs to talk to her or fire her ASAP."}
{"text":"I've heard loootttsss of things about this place so I had to check it out!  My husband and I went right after work on a Monday.  I was excited to see the $3.00 any canned beer special.  (especially because we are heading to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers in concert later!). We sat on the patio to enjoy the weather.  Chips and salsa were brought out promptly and the waiter recommended the white queso because we wanted a smaller portion.   We devoured the queso pretty quickly and the server brought more chips right away.  We split three tacos for dinner.  We got the pacos taco, skirt steak taco, and grilled white fish.  My favorite was the pacos taco (yes it's worth the extra .50 cents).  The grilled white fish was fishy tasting, so we should've gotten it fried.    I'm not a rice and beans gal but my husband said they were amazing, better than Cantinas.   Overall good service and food!"}
{"text":"I would come back here for the chips and salsa alone. It's the perfect storm of thin white corn tortilla chips and a delicious homemade salsa. Not too smoky, not too spicy, not too tomatoey. Tableside guacamole was great as well. We filled up way too much on that stuff. I will never learn my lesson.   They had $3 OMB pints on Sunday, thats a pretty good special in my opinion. So good that I skipped the margaritas and had beer instead.   I ordered the Too Big Taco Salad and was not really impressed with that. And I know, you're thinking well you ordered a salad what do you expect. But I ordered the salad because I knew I would be eating a lot of chips and didnt really want anymore chips/taco shell/tortilla and the salad was mostly chips.   My boyfriend got 3 of the tacos. We liked country fried steak the best. Tastes like a cheesesteak taco. His two favorite things. The other two (fish and Paco's Taco) were good too. The homemade tortillas really make them. The taco plates are very generous portions with good-sized tacos and rice and beans.   We sat at the bar and service was efficient but not friendly. The bar seats are oddly uncomfortable. It's like the backs are too curved. Would go for a table next time.   Definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":"Oh, Paco, where have you been all my life?  And I am not talking about the Esai Morales character that was hanging out with Sean Penn in the early 80s movie Bad Boys, either.  If he learned to put together a meal like this in a juvenile detention center, then forget reform - more people need to spend time behind bars!  We actually just happened to be in the area, with no particular intention to check them out for restaurant week, but since they had it going on, we stopped in to see what was happening, and were oh-so-glad we did.  The special included a Miss Kitty's margarita, guacamole or ceviche as an appetizer, a salad, fajitas or shrimp for dinner, and either tres leches or fried ice cream and brownie for dessert.  So why just four stars, instead of five?  It was actually a close call.  The service, despite the place being slammed for a Friday night during restaurant week, was spot-on.  But the salad was limp.  Yes, limp.  There was not a crisp piece of lettuce to be found.  To their credit, the fine staff at Paco's even offered to make another to replace it - but I really had no room, and the entree had not even arrived yet.  I was impressed by the offer, however, and hopefully the next visit will see improvements here.  I totally get the desire to prepare for a rush, and putting salads in the fridge in advance is understandable.  But it does knock them down a bit.  The portions definitely did not hurt.  We ate on them for not one, but two meals after we got home.  And the food, with the exception of the salad, was spot-on.  The guacamole was much better than the ceviche (though the ceviche is good - you just get so much more enjoyment out of the guacamole it is ridiculous).  Paco's is not for everyone.  Do not take a date and expect a quiet romantic evening.  There are televisions scattered about.  It does have a bit of a noise level to it, but not so much that you cannot talk during dinner.  And it does get a bit crowded, so if you like to get up (to go to the bathroom, for instance), it might be a tight squeeze.  Otherwise, dig in.  It is well worth it."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to get tacos. I recommend doing reservations!! Last time we went there was a 45 min wait. This time I called and made a reservation and we walked right in and got sat!   Their salsa is so good. We asked if they had anything spicer and they have a habanero salsa. That was delicious. I'm definitely asking for it next time.   I always get tacos with flour tortillas. No slaw with extra rice and refried beans. I'm not a big bean fan but their refried beans are the best. It's cheesy and has a smoky flavor to it. I got the beef taco, steak taco and shrimp taco. They are all loaded with meat! My favorite taco is the calamari. They only do that as a taco of the day but I would love if they bring it back!!   Service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Loved it. Loved the margaritas, loved the queso dip (peppers, bacon and pineapple!!), loved the tacos and fajitas. Great atmosphere. Little gem in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Amazing mexican food, service was amazing by Samantha P. very friendly, loved the decoration and all the variety of tequila!  Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in and try this place being its restaurant week in Charlotte. Their was a hour and a half wait for two. This is bad time wise, but also a good sign the food is good because if the wait on a Saturday night at 6:30pm is 10 minutes you might want to look elsewhere IMO. Our waitress Holly was very attentive and pleasant. She made some good recommendations that turned out pretty good. In short me and the wife enjoyed the food very much. The chips and salsa were very good and hard to stop eating. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"First tried Paco Taco during restaurant week and really liked it. We've gone back a couple of times. The guacamole and veggie fajitas are delicious!  The margaritas are strong. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have a lot of dietary restrictions and was able to find many dishes which I could eat. Gluten friendly menu and vegetarian options. The resturaunt has a great feel to it and there were mostly business lunches going on during the weekday at noon time. There is a large selection of alcohol and over 100 types of tequila. The staff was very friendly. I appreciate that you can reserve a table online. Chips and salsa are on fleek! We even got a to go order and it was packaged nicely and stay led fresh! Chips and salsa came with the takeout order. Food came out fast to our table! I highly recommend the fajitas! I have no complaints. I will definitely frequent his resturaunt!"}
{"text":"I've finally made it to Paco's Tacos & Tequila and it was worth it.  We came in with two friends from out of town pretty late and were seated quickly.    So to make it easy on why 5 stars: Food was tasty, plentiful and a good value: Of course, gotta go with the tacos, and I prefer the flour tortilla (soft tacos). I had the Pick 3 tacos: a traditional Paco's brisket taco, the chicken one, and flank steak taco. Each just a little different, so I wished there were other choices of salsa to pick from.  Comes with the traditional side of rice and three different style beans to pick from.  Of course the tequila: We only had the margaritas and they go great with any and all Mexican style food.  Prompt and friendly service from all staff: The waitress was knowledgeable, made some good recommendations, and the chips and salsa kept coming despite a request for more.  Sure, I'd come back every once in a while.  I can see the tacos getting old after numerous visits though."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere....wait staff is superb! The drinks are strong and delish!!!! I recommend the tableside guacamole and the chicken tortilla soup. All food was fresh and Devine! Will definitely be back for an after work dinner and drink session!"}
{"text":"Was able to try 4 different tacos between my order and my girlfriend's and all were outstanding. Favorites were Turkey Carnitas and chicken fried steak. Charro beans on the side were great and the cole slaw was surprisingly good too. I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for good Tex-Mex in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ah Paco's, I was really excited to try your tequila soaked spot. Too bad I came for lunch and didn't get a chance to indulge in a big mamma jamma margarita, but that's for next time. Onto my lunch experience...  I met a great business contact here and we enjoyed a tasty lunch. What we did not enjoy was great service - something I have come to expect from a Frank Scibelli restaurant. No, no one was outright rude or mean, our server was just kind of a dud of sorts. I don't know if he was having a bad day or just needs more training but it wasn't great.   First, the food... I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas and they were tasty. They were topped with a creamy queso and a bit of sour cream mixture. The chicken was tender and I enjoyed the two enchiladas. The refried beans were standard as was the rice. My only gripe? I wish it had a little more spice - in all components. The flavor of the chicken and the dish as a whole would be much elevated with a little kick.   The service...sorry for the long, drawn out info... Our server was just kind of absent - he wasn't engaging, didn't help much with recommendations and he also forgot a few things that my dining companion asked for on the side, one being chopped jalapenos. When my dining companion asked for fresh, chopped jalapenos on the side our server looked at her and blankly said, \"I don't think we have any fresh jalapenos.\" Really, that's odd...we both thought. Then she said, well I'd appreciate any jalapenos please. Once our food came out, no jalapenos. So we politely asked the runner for the same request, and fresh chopped jalapenos came out in seconds. Ok....  And then the bill. So, it was my fault for not digging into the bill pad, but our sever did indeed give me the bill as I requested, on one check. There was a bit of confusion as I requested a copy of the full bill, and I didn't see one in the check pad, etc. Regardless, it was in there and that's my fault for not digging, but after the manager brought me a copy of the bill and reconciled (my) error the server said, \"You need to tell my manager it's ok, because otherwise you're going to get me in trouble.\" Hmm. Nice. I happily told the manager there was not problem and it was my misunderstanding, I was chatting with my business contact, didn't notice, etc. I apologized but I thought it was pretty rude for the server to go there, if you know what I mean.  So, long story short, the food was good and I definitely want to come back and give it another go but I hope that server's having a better day and if not, I hope I'm seated in another section."}
{"text":"All I can say is. \" bravo\". Awsome service and best of all. The food is great.I give it  9/10 . Will be a repeat customer . Been there 3 times and gets better each time."}
{"text":"Jalapeno margarita + kick ass salsa = one happy Nikki.  I have always loved the food here, but the service has pushed this from 4 stars to 5 stars.  Let's begin with research I did a few weeks ago for the Weekly Yelp. For my Yelp Flips The Bird issue, I called on a super busy night. The nice young girl on the phone answered all my odd questions (I never told her who I was or why I was asking all these questions). So nice... so helpful.   This past weekend, I took my buddy Steve to bust his Paco's Tacos cherry. The bartender was our server. She was fantastic. Super friendly, so good at her job. She knew the menu by heart. And when she got tied up with to-go orders at the bar, another nice girl jumped right in to bring us boxes and the check. During the meal, the manager walked over to ask how our lunch was. I wish all restaurants did this. It's such a simple gesture, but it really does go a long way.  Okay now to the food!  Chips and salsa: I love the salsa here. Perfect combination of spice and flavor... plus the chips are so light and fresh. I could easily crush multiple orders by myself.  Firestarter margarita: Jalapeño infused tequila, fresh lime juice and ginger beer. Great heat. The ginger beer gives it a very unique flavor... unlike any other jalapeno margarita I've had.   Paco's Taco: Brisket, caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce. The brisket full of flavor and piled high.   Turkey Club Carnitas: slow cooked shredded turkey, sliced avocado, shredded iceberg, jalapeno bacon, tomato and avocado ranch. The Yelp family was right once again. Wow, this is a great taco.  Charro beans: Don't get me wrong, I like black beans.... but I have to go with charro every time for my side.   Fajitas: Nothing beats the smell of the sizzling plate as it comes out... making all other people jealous that they didn't order it. Huge portion size and a giant plate of fresh toppings. This easily made for two meals.   I'm a huge fan of this place... and now so is my buddy Steve. He was super impressed by his first visit.   Cheers Paco's! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos and the made-at-the-table guacamole was delicious."}
{"text":"First time patrons at Paco's. Enjoyed the Enchiladas de Dennis very much! Highly recommended. Can't compare the dish to other restaurants because it's quite unique..... Spinach, chopped chicken, cheese & spices, topped with creamy guacamole and roasted red pepper pureé sauces. Wow! Not spicy/hot, just pure flavor. So delicious, can't wait to return. Husband enjoyed the Chopped Salad, large portion very filling. We each shared a few bites. I found the salad dressing quite tasty. A flavorful chipotle ranch without the overbearing smoky spice chipotle can often be. A wonderful blend of fresh veggies with a delicious dressing. Fantastic dinner!"}
{"text":"Being new to the Charlotte area I was excited to try a new place for Happy Hour/early dinner in the Southpark area. Disappointed is an understatement.  We arrived about 515pm, the place was dead, and it took a solid 20 minutes to get our drinks and chips/salsa. There were 5 in our party, all of us had cocktails.  Anyone who thinks the guacamole is good has never been to an authentic restaurant. It is a novel idea to have it made at your table, but it has zero taste.  Our server was rude, slow and snapped her fingers when we needed water refills. Our chip bowl was always empty and any request from extra napkins to a cocktail re-order seemed to be a huge inconvenience to our server.  The queso dip was good, but at 9 dollars, way overpriced.  I ordered the 3 taco meal; the turkey and bacon taco was verry salty, and I LOVE salt; the beef taco and chicken taco were ok and you could tell the entire meal had been sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes. The refried beans were delish and the highlight of my dining entire experience.  The beans, fresh drinks (although pricey) and location get it 2 stars. I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"Service guy was nice and pleasant.  But if u want Mexican food you can't find it here. Mexican names on food and done American way. I know it says tex-mex but it's tasted like mex-carolinex."}
{"text":"We had a party of ten show up on Friday, 5/16.  It felt like the waitress had just been trained on up selling.  Order tequila shots but she recommended one of the higher priced brands. We struck with one of the lower cost ones, still $9 a shot, but she persisted. Food was good enough. Retired to the bar, ordered a round of drinks, threw $80 on the bar. Money and bill gone, we order more drinks. New bill shows up with all the drinks from the first round still listed.  Pointed it out to the female bartender and she returned the $80. She must've figured that there were so many of us, someone else would pay. She's a crook. Cute small brunette, with a black spot on her soul.  Dear managers. You've got a problem. All of us attended a party the next day and Pacos got ripped. Great potential, but ripping off customers, we'll never be back"}
{"text":"We had a great order out meal from Paco's Tacos & Tequila a few weeksMy boyfriend got the chicken chimichanga and it was delicious! I ordered the tanked up (white fish) taco and the shake down shrimp taco. Both were great. The charro beans was a nice switch up from standard black or refried beans - very good! Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"I love the margaritas and the tacos aren't bad either. Guacamole is freshly made and always a great appetizer."}
{"text":"I don't live in Charlotte but if this is the best Mexican in town I feel sorry for you all.  Nothing bad but nothing great either.  Overall Meh and a little pricey. The Yelp reviews fooled me- normally they are spot on. The jalapeño cucumber margarita was good.  Not very spicy however.  The no name margarita was gross.  I would have been angry if it wasn't on special for $5.  Overly sweet and week.   The volcano dip was just okay.  A little too thick for my husband and my taste.   The tortillas were great and defiantly house made.  I had the beef brisket, grilled fish and turkey tacos.   The brisket was a little dry but okay with some hot sauce.  Turkey and fish tacos had good flavor.  Charro beans were not hot.  Had they been they might have tasted better.  The worst of the night was the tres leches cake.  The driest cake I have ever had.  What kind of tres leches isn't moist.  My kids eat anything and they left the entire thing on the plate.   The server was okay.  We had to ask her for things two and three times.  She was nice enough. On a positive the salsa had good flavor.  Will I come back ?? Probably not."}
{"text":"Boring. The waitress bored us with her lack of interest. This is my 3rd visit and the thrill has gone. Next time I will save the money and hit the drive up at Taco Bell. I am sorry I bothered to ask for more tea. I know you we're busy texting or smoking or discussing what you did last night. I won't bother you again."}
{"text":"If you haven't yet discovered Paco's Tacos & Tequila in SouthPark run to the nearest mirror, take a good look, and then punch yourself in the face for missing out because seriously you are sucking at life. After your recovery jump in your car and get over there! Paco's Tacos is EVERYTHING. The rice, the beans, the enchiladas al denis, it's just too much for words right now as I'm having some sort of food flashback but trust me you need to get there. I like to go on a Sunday and sit outside with my shades on to complete my recovery from Saturday night."}
{"text":"All of the tacos are delicious and the salsa they give you at the start of the meal is amazing. Everything tastes very fresh and the dishes are all flavorful. It's super busy at lunch so go at a non-peak hour if you can"}
{"text":"Simply delicious food! When the chips and salsa are excellent you know the rest will be also. We shared a 3 taco plate with 3 different meats. All were moist, fresh and finger licking good. But what really made our visit so special was the people working that day. They were super busy but were still able to seat us outside with our service dog. Thank you again Jasmine you are a wonderful hostess with a winning smile for all that you took care of.  Our server Darwin G was professional & very friendly. You rock Darwin! Plus gave great advice on the margarita special of the day! We live down the street and will be making many more visits to this great restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"The taco was a 5 but everything else was closer to a 3... so a 3 it is.  There were complimentary chips and salsa but the chips had no salt on them and the salsa was rather flavorless and runny.  I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a taco plate for $7 (decent price for the portion). I got the tanked up taco which is a fried (or grilled) fish filet which was really tasty. My friends all got generous portions in their tacos too so it was hard to eat them without the contents falling out (not a bad problem too have, really). You could choose to have a four, corn, or crispy tortilla which is nice.  I got the charro beans which tasted like watery baked beans with shredded pork... not a fan. I'd probably go with refried next time.  The rice was pretty flavorful but the slaw was average. Service was okay. I'll probably come back for their enchilada...eventually."}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best tacos I've had.  Can't wait to return.  The guacamole was fresh and delicious.  Chips and salsa was out of this world."}
{"text":"Make reservations if you're going on a typically busy night (Fri/Sat). Food is incredible, as are the drinks. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at this place. The servers are really friendly,  they give the food in a timely manner and the food itself is amazing! ! When I've gone I usually would get a brisket taco which is not good everywhere.  But here....it's so good!  Also the different margaritas with a long list of Tequila is the cherry on top. Definitely a place to go to with friends or a date night.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"how i not review yet, been couple times?  maybe write review like my texting - all broken english.    came here with mouse, the YMCA thug, post-working out.  place gets 4 stars.  really good chips and salsa.  maybe bc i came from gym to work out and was starving, or maybe to go with margaritas. anyways, salsa is goooood - has a little chipotle or something to give it nice taste.  end result: salsa bowl empty, need more!  had 2 tacos - one chicken, one fish - both solid, not worth more description or more typed words.  mouse had salad with shrimp added - shrimps were shrimpy.  tried the firestarter margs - it hit the spot.  reminds me of homemade gin'n'sriracha (not a real thing, don't try), but better.    get table-side guac - if it ain't table-side you don't know what the guac is going in there.  :X  def coming back here - solid eats.  dmo out."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Paco's Tacos & Tequila. We always start off with the awesome guacamole, which they make at table side. I always get the combo so I can sample all the taco. Fish, shrimp, chicken and brisket tacos are spectacular.  The customary chips and salsa are a perfect mix of mild heat and saltiness and we have never had bad service. The waitstaff is very friendly and informative. Be sure to try the bar-b-que corn (have to ask for it). Its mouthwatering.  Big fan of Paco's and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Wow, tried the paco taco and the grilled chicken taco.  Both were awesome.  Service was awesome too.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not a big fan of Mexican food.  I've tried both Tex-Mex and \"authentic\" versions over the years at countless Mexi restaurants (my husband happens to be a BIG fan), and was never too impressed.  However, I was immediately a fan of Paco's Tacos after my first visit.  Despite it being Tex-Mex, its Beef Brisket Tacos were some of the best I've ever had!  Being a hot spot, it's best to get reservations for this restaurant, and the place is always crowded...but the food is well worth it.  I think this may be one of our go-to Mexi restaurants...at least until it proves me wrong? ;P"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were perfection! I had a salad with salmon which was very good and satisfying. I also had yucca fries which were super yummy and a Cadillac Margarita that was good too. The service was top notch. Our server's name was Darwin and he was amazing!"}
{"text":"Yassssss! Guess who drinks on their lunch break? Me! (Don't Need Your Judgement). If you're friends with me, you know that your girl loves a margarita. #1 drink of choice.  Bartender-Annie- see that girl for a margarita done right. Thank you Annie for all that you do for people who work in corporate America, that get 1 solid hour for lunch to drink their faces off (me).   Anyway,... yes this place is great. The food is good, not the BEST,... but perfect for quick lunches or meeting out with your coworkers after work.   I typically just get margaritas & salsa. All the food groups are there. So yeah, ..."}
{"text":"Something has happened to my Paco's from a year ago - we went in not that long ago and were so disappointed in the way we were treated by the snobby hostess that we nearly left before we had a chance to get seated. (Why must they act like you're bothering them?!?) We didn't want to sit outside because it was somewhat windy out - and apparently there weren't any inside tables available - so the hostess was really snippy that we wouldn't take the table outside. When we did get seated, we were happy to order margaritas and guac (both of which were DELICIOUS).... but my favorite salad was missing from the menu - (I literally used to dream of this salad it was so tasty). I ordered another and my hubs ordered tacos. His was a bit greasy when it arrived and my salad truly felt like an afterthought. The lettuce was hardly even chopped!! It was WHOLE leaves and probably could have been called a WEDGE salad since it was BIG leaves. The toppings were sparse (also not like I remembered when I was more frequent) - our chips kept coming so that made up for it I guess. I definitely left FULL of tortilla chips, salsa and guac. My salad was hardly noteworthy and my husband's tacos were weak. Hoping this was just an \"off\" day - or I'm afraid it's a sign that Paco's is on their way out. :("}
{"text":"No pics but the food and facilities were great. We went with 9 people and no reservations and they were extremely accommodating."}
{"text":"Best. Mexican. Ever. Everything is fresh and homemade.  Margaritas were amazing and every taco we tried was great. They make the tortillas right out in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here tonight with about 18 of my work colleagues. Food was great and service was excellent. I had the signature paco tacos with charro beans. Very tasty!  One of our group was celebrating his birthday and the server even took a sombrero off the wall at our request, crowned him with it and we all sang Happy Birthday. As you can expect on a Saturday night the place was packed. Super energy. Lots of fun."}
{"text":"Hello friends,  Third time (writing a review) the charm. I'm always satisfied when i come here. I like the menu. I like the menu so much in fact that I noticed I purchased the same exact thing the last time I was here. After i post my most recent pictures I noticed I ordered the same last time.  This place has more than enough reviews in which I'm sure are perfect. I  most likely won't be able to add much to the already made reviews other than the food is good.   The drinks..... well.. they are as strong as Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire & Sammy Sosa combined!! And in THIS CASE...that's a good thing.   TTFN"}
{"text":"The Al Pastor tacos are the best things that have ever entered my mouth hole. Service is always friendly.  Id like to take a minute to bitch about Yelp and how it seems to not give a rats ass about the business. Is it not rediculous that they give no option to downvote a review? People leave the most asinine complaints sometimes clearly outright falsified reviews and the business just needs to sit there and take it.  Scroll down and read Adam J's review where he complains about bland meat. This man is clearly an idiot and his opinion is dumb. Empty tables dont mean shit buddy, you need to have a waitress available to serve you too. I hope that you dont go back to Pacos Tacos because you dont deserve to eat there."}
{"text":"Good food fast service great guacamole noisy bitches in da background doe but can't fault the restaurant for that a lil pricy but good size portions"}
{"text":"It's the closest thing that I've found so far to Tex-Mex!!!!  I heart tacos...and everything about meixcan food.  I've been to Paco's three times now and it's been a pleasure.  I recently discovered that going during the week is easy on the pocket book.  :)  They have half price bottles of vino on Wednesdays...which again...Hubs was thrilled.  LOL!  He enjoys beer specials and I light up when there are wine specials.  We sat out on the patio and chatted with the waitress which was nice.  She was friendly and just laid back.  We weren't in any hurry...enjoying the cool night air while we sipped on our 1/2 price bottle.  The fresh Quac is my fav (nothing like what i make though.  *wink*) but it's fresh and oh so good.  Fish tacos are decent...chips and salsa are yummy.  All three times we've been here, the GM has come out to either greet us or bring us our chips.  So crazy, yet refreshing.  He's extremly nice.   Can't wait to go back....this place will def be on the rotation list! Plus it's close to me casa just in case....hehehe!"}
{"text":"We just visited weekend. The location is convenient by the mall but overall just an ok place. Be aware weekends are packed, it was going to be an hr wait but we got lucky with a bar table. The service in our opinion was slow, maybe due to how busy. Server was super nice when we got grab her. We ordered cheese dip, I got a chimichanga and my husband their trio option. Dip was fine, salsa was pretty hot they served. My chimichanga with beef was ok, it honestly tasted more like a cheeseburger! My husband said his was just ok and for the price we won't return. It was over $50 for two dishes, queso and one beer...we feel we can find really good Mexican for about half that price. I'm not sure if this is a chain but felt more like that than a local place."}
{"text":"Great margaritas. Good food. Easy local spot that we frequent 1-2 times a month. Available on open table. Great patio."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat! Gotta love the endless chips to start! Excellent food, great staff, cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wife and I love sitting at the bar. Salsa is amazing, service is great and tacos are to die for. I hope they come back with the barbacoa special."}
{"text":"I freakn love the TOO BIG TACO SALAD! You have to put it in caps for effect. You see this is not your avg throw it in a bland deep fried bowl and pray salad. Oh, no, its a plate n in-your-face creation. Lettuce explain...  Theres layers to this ish. 1st are the Herculean triangles whic holds the whole dish up giving you purpose. Layered with black beans, queso, mounds o flavorful beef (can use chicken or go vegetarian if you like that sorta thing), corn, diced tomatos, onions, quac, sour cream, drizzled im a cilantro lime dressing!!!!!!!!!!!  Whoaaaaaaaa (im my nature boy rick flair voice)"}
{"text":"My son took me here for lunch while home on college break. He said if he wasn't a poor struggling college student, he would have tipped 100%. Our server, James, was awesome! No matter what questions we had, he had knowledgeable answers! Our chip basket was always refilled and we were well taken care of!"}
{"text":"I work in the Southpark area so Paco's Tacos & Tequila has become a restaurant I frequent weekly.  I'll grab lunch to go or dine in after work with friends or coworkers.  Since I've had the opportunity to eat there quite a bit, I've tried most of the entrees and appetizers. Some of my favorites include: the veggie quesadilla, chicken fajita salad, paco's tacos, and the sour cream chicken enchiladas.        The service is great, which is always a reason to come back.  The wait staff and managers are always attentive and prompt; I don't think I've ever seen the bottom of a glass without a new one being brought to the table first.  If you've eaten at some of Frank's other restaurants (Cantina 1511, Big Daddy's, Mama Ricottas..) you know that poor service is never an issue.     Because of the great food and mindful staff it is defiantly worth checking out.  It's family friendly but you can also enjoy a casual date without being overwhelmed. They also have started some really good drink specials throughout the week (try the Texas Rose with pear infused tequila). The price point in the right place as well."}
{"text":"The few times I've been to Paco's, I have found the food to be underwhelming (it's not the best Tex Mex I've ever had, but it's not the worst, and it usually leaves me full and bringing home leftovers). I've had a wide variety of meals at Paco's, and it has always been the company and the margaritas that keeps me coming back, not really the food. The first time I went to Paco's, I got a taco platter, and while they were good, they weren't stand out or spectacular. I've also tried the enchiladas, but my issue with those is I'm more of an authentic kind of gal, and enchies (a very technical and affectionate term for enchiladas) made with sour cream chicken,  or topped with chili gravy don't really wow me (plus they were drowning in sauce, which after bite three made them soggy). My friend can't say enough nice things about Paco's salads (she loves the chopped salad and the Paco's salad), but the one time I went the salad route the veggies didn't seem fresh and the honey cilantro lime dressing was overpowering, and I was disappointed yet again. Yet, I could never write Paco's off (my friends loyally go and say I will find something I like), so I keep giving them more chances. A few weeks ago I was happy I didn't give up on Paco's.  By far the star of the show at Paco's is the fajitas. As I was browsing the menu to try something new yet again (my fallback was going to be to branch out at get some tacos I'd never tried) I stumbled upon the fajita platters tucked in the first page of their new menu. Paco's delivered on steak fajitas, and I was thrilled. The steak was seared to my liking and super tender. It looked beautiful; there were ample grill marks and it was simple and straightforward, which allowed its smoky flavor to shine. An abundance of vegetables accompanied the steak on the sizzling platter, and the peppers and onions melted in my mouth and burst with flavor on each bite. I tucked my precious steak and veggies into piping hot, soft flour tortillas, and topped them with traditional fixings (beans, cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole and sour cream) before gorging myself.

{"text":"Service is always pretty good.  The food is very average and not what I was hoping for. I do not like the salsa, the flavor is bland and boring. Three stars are for the drinks!!! I love the fire starter! Any other drink I've gotten there was very good in flavor and size."}
{"text":"Service and food were excellent. I had the chicken chimichanga without red sauce and beans. It was delicious. It was a tex-mex restaurant rather than Mexican. The chips and salsa served before the meals are good, but  not great.   We enjoyed the atmosphere which caters to everyone including large groups. Our service was outstanding. In my opinion, the prices are too high. My dish was $13. It was a lot of food, but I'd rather have a smaller portion for less money. My husband had the quesadilla, which was very small (3 pieces) for $10. He ate some of mine because he didn't have enough. Because he had the same dish for lunch before, he realized the lunch and dinner portions are the same size, but the price increased at dinner.  Located within walking distance to South Park Mall and Charlotte Marriott South Park. I would go back, but would try to share a meal."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend and had a little wait.  Almost missed our table because they text you to let you know the table is ready, even though we were sitting 3 feet from the hostess waiting.   I had the turkey tacos and my friend had the taco salad.  We enjoyed our food but weren't blown away.  Overall the service and the food was average."}
{"text":"My favorite go to Tex-Mex restaurant! The food and service is always amazing. I would recommend making a reservation on weekends because it does get very busy. The tacos are delicious and packed with a lot!! The tequila flights are great as well."}
{"text":"Recommended to me by a coworker and it was on point!  The chips and salsa are great.  They have several salsas you can ask for, make sure to try the habanero and verde if you like a little more spice.  The chips remind me of Salsaritas...but better.  We also ordered a small queso and it was one of the better queso dips I've had.  The drinks are pricey but strong, I could only do one margarita.  The food is good, I got the grilled shrimp taco and skirt steak with rice and coleslaw.  My husband got the build your own combo with the same tacos and one enchilada.  I have to say the enchilada was the best.  Cano Fish taco still beats any tacos in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Pros: Parking Great venue Definitely kid friendly Great margarita Great food   This place is so consistent. It's nothing fancy or special, but it's really good Mexican and in a great location. Always a go to."}
{"text":"THE BEST MARGARITAS EVER! Great service, although I got a salad with salmon on it that was rancid. They replaced it with chicken and it was great. I suggest not getting seafood there. My sister had great tacos but said the beans were mediocre. Will return!"}
{"text":"Ok, listen. Overall, it was good. Not my favorite, but good nonetheless. The margaritas were really good,  chips were warm and crispy, salsa was WAY TOO HOT and I like spicy, but I couldn't do it, so she brought over salsa verde, which useless. Not everyone like shit that hot. Just make the shit mild so EVERYONE can enjoy it. The  guacamole was one of the best I've ever had, mine is the best. Me and Baldie ordered the tacos. You have to order two or more in order to get the combo price, otherwise it's all ala carte.  I ordered the shrimp taco and the brisket taco. Baldie ordered steak taco and beef taco. We made the mistake of ordering them in a flour tortilla instead of corn, which looked like flatbread, much thicker than a flour tortilla. That came with a nice portion of choice of beans, we picked refried, it also came with rice, which was good. Frank didn't like his beef taco. My shrimp taco was pretty much filled with shrimp and the brisket was flavorful and tender.  So, I definitely go back. Next time we make a reservation, that place was mobbed!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this spot with the hubby.... for starters they have some amazing bottomless complimentary salsa, that has just the right amount of spice. But I wasn't ready for the amazing flavor packed into the \"Too Big Taco Salad\"! Amazeballs! I mean this salad was amazing and one of the best taco salads that I've ever had. I know some of you may be thinking \"a salad,REALLY\", but this was no mediocre taco salad. There was a layer of tortillas at the base, but not your ordinary tortillas. These tortillas were thick cut and super crispy to withstand all of the flavors atop of it. Next there was black beans, queso cheese, romaine lettuce, fresh cut sweet corn, tomatoes, chilli lime dressing and I topped mine with a piece of grilled chicken. Yoooooooo.... this salad was foodilicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The food is good here. We had done a reservation in advance in the day. The server was friendly in suggesting us any good options in their restaurant. The taste of the food is very authentic and we even got to know the fact that this place owner did his research to bring in the beat Mexican food in town. Pretty interesting to me and very relishing to the taste buds.  We preferred to order 3 set crispy chicken and 2 set fish tacos. Each tacos come with a side of rice and another choice of your side. Very tasty! We enjoyed the tacos by gulping our margaritas.  We also had a chance to taste the dessert , the only one which they have - tres leches. It was ok. But , I would definitely recommend the tacos and drinks. Will definitely come back for more Mexican food."}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas!   Delicious Fajitas and believe it or not, brisket to die for.  Go often!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful spot! I would recommend Paco's to anyone. On weekends there can be a bit of a wait but it's always worth it. Their margaritas are great. Their chips are salsa are DELICIOUS! I cannot come here and not get a taco. The flour tortillas are amazing. My favorite tacos are the shake down shrimp and the pacos taco. On my most recent trip with a friend, I got the taco and soup lunch special. I selected a pacos taco and chicken tortilla soup and it was amazing! The one thing I would change is that I would ask for the tortilla strips on the side for the soup because they got pretty soggy after a little while. Next time, I will order tortilla strips on the side and just add some as I go. The taco was delicious as always. My friend ordered the chopped salad with chicken and used the salsa as the salad dressing. She commented on how great it was.   This is a spot that I will go to again and again and again."}
{"text":"Was visiting my sister and we stopped here for dinner The tacos here were really spot on and affordable and the guac was delicious, not as good as LA but for Charlotte it's a pretty darn good spot for tasty and affordable mexican fare"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and best yet...service. Henny was our server and did an outstanding job. Even answered ALL my sister's questions. (She always has many). If you like authentic Latin fare. You gotta go here. A+"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for my family reunion. I had told my cousins that we had to try this place. It was good, but not is good as I expected.  We order calamari and queso for appetizers, both were delicious.  I ordered the combination platter where you choose 1 quesadilla, 1 taco and 1 enchilada. I had the chicken quesadilla. It was just okay. I chose the calamari taco. That was quite delicious. The enchilada I chose was the chicken and spinach. It would have been good if they didn't use american cheese. American cheese is absolutely disgusting.  The pomegranate margarita I chose for my drink was delicious."}
{"text":"Not your ordinary Mexican food. Very good salsa. Take some home. I get veggie enchiladas every time. Fried plantains on the side. They pay attention to the details. The beans, chips, guacamole, are all special, not obligatory like most places. Cocktails are special too. Wish I could remember the name of the one I had there last time. Something with bourbon and lime. Yummy. I'm not from Charlotte but I always go to Paco's when I'm there. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A clutch spot near the South Park mall to watch MLB, NFL, Premier League, even NASCAR. Very flavorful tacos and a good bar selection while their tequila options are plentiful. Guacamole could use some more flavor but overall this is a quality spot. Go let your wife/girlfriend/daughter/whatever shop while you get your taco and tequila on!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delish!!!Waitress very pleasant. Must try the taco salad vegetarian style add mushrooms!!!"}
{"text":"Food-wise, this place is already at 4, 4 1/2 stars.  Add in the fantastic margaritas and cocktails and it surpasses five stars.  My favorite is the Firestarter which is weird because I don't like ginger beer.  It is made with GB and jalapeno infused tequila and is a kick to your tastebuds.  The one I don't recommend is the one made with 100 year old Cointreau.  Not because it is bad, but it is not worth $16.  My wife always gets the quesedilla.  The chicken is tender and juicy and the tortilla crisp.  The quesedilla comes with guac, sour cream and pico de gallo which are all delicious.  The guac is fresh made (I've been told) and the pico de gallo also seems very fresh.  I have tried a wide variety of things but I always get the stuffed jalapenos.  They are wrapped in bacon and stuffed with cheese.  Sometimes spicier than others, but always good.  I often get the steak or chicken fajitas.  While pricier than your \"mom & Pop\" places, they are worth it.  You don't get a little pile of steak that looks like shoe leather.  This is real steak, cut well and cooked properly.  It is not tough at all and you can actually bite through it unlike at some places."}
{"text":"What a great find near Southpark mall.  The complimentary chips were fresh and hot and the salsa had just the right smokey flavor.  The taco and salad was the perfect lunch combo. The Paco's Taco on the house made flour tortilla was filled with shredded beef and sweet caramelized onions.  The chopped salad was filled with fresh vegetables you don't usually get - jicima, grilled corn, chickpeas - in addition to the typical lettuce and tomatoes."}
{"text":"I heard about this place at Triple C on Cinco de Mayo and figured that was just as good as a day as any to give it a go... Super glad that I did...   Clearly, as it was May 5th, the place was slammed... The upside to this being a solo mission?  No waiting for a table... I just pulled up to the bar and perused the snazzy menu... I met a nice guy named Joe who told me that the shrimp tacos were really good... I wasn't really all that hungry because of the ridiculously tasty and filling brunch I'd just had at Vida, so I didn't want a whole big platter... I noticed that they do a singular taco option, though!  Perfect... :)  The couple beside me (in from Greensboro and completely sweet) also heard Joe recommend the shrimp tacos and echoed his endorsement... I figured I'd give it a go, then... I decided on the broccoli with queso and one shrimp taco...  They're called the Shake Down Shrimp and I'm not really sure why, but who cares at this point?  They were amazing... They apparently make their own tortillas and that was a tasty base, the fillings are fried shrimp, shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, cilantro, chipotle ranch and Cholula (hot sauce)... Now, I just started to eat shrimp, but I am still a no-go on ranch, so I had mine without the sauce... I guess that would have cooled down the spiciness of the dish, but I was loving the heat factor...  The herbs, cabbage and pico all tasted fresh and delightful... The cabbage had a really nice crunch... The broccoli, you know, tasted like broccoli... That queso was insane, though... A total blanket of cheesiness with a minute fiery kick...   The bartenders were attentive and friendly... Even while they were slammed with all the people surrounding the bar and filling the restaurant's orders... I can't wait to go back and actually enjoy sitting down in this place for a while... There's something called a Firestarter margarita (with jalapeno infused tequila) that has my name on it..."}
{"text":"Total fan of the food!  Regretfully the bar has much to be desired.  I had a margarita and sangria and both were terrible.  Very bitter. I'll be back because like I said the food was awesome, but my bar choices will be rendered to the \"can't mess it up\" category."}
{"text":"Went to Pacos Tacos for the first time and my second time was the day after.  This establishment really has it all. We sat at the bar, they were completely packed out early evening on a Saturday. The service was still amazing, want to say her name is Samantha. She even told us about her favorite tequilas and had some good convo. We had bacon wrapped jalapeños, chili, tacos, and margaritas. Cucumber jalapeño margarita and the firestarter margarita are amaze! One for flavor, one for heat. I almost forgot the bacon egg and cheese enchilada, queso, and chicken tortilla soup! I cannot wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times but after today I'm not sure I will continue. The waiter was friendly and got us our checks quickly that was appreciated and he did a good job. When I got my check I noticed that my bank account had already been billed the total amount plus a 20% tip included in the amount my bank showed. I asked for a manager because I felt like that was a bad practice. He came over looked at my check and basically blamed it all on my bank when this has NEVER happened here before or any other place for that matter. The manager lacked empathy and concern. I don't want to patronize a location that doesn't value their customers."}
{"text":"Salsa and chips were really good, salsa has just enough kick. We got the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeños to start and they were great. Service was pretty good, they forgot our silverware and napkins until our food came and I got up and asked for some.   I got the \"paco taco\" which is brisket and was ok. The other taco was the Al Pastor. The pork was so salty I couldn't eat it. I told the waiter and he said he would let the chef know and left it at that.   I prefer Cantina 1511 and Cabo's tacos to Pacos."}
{"text":"We arrived on a busy Saturday and was told the wait time would be 45 -60 minutes. I decided to wait gave my phone number and was texted about 25 minutes later letting me know my table was ready. The service was excellent, food even better, everything came out so fast. Paco's is doing it right. I would recommend to anyone who will listen. The shakedown shrimp tacos will make you slap ya mama"}
{"text":"Came here on a date and i have to say, it was amazing! Get the tacos! I ordered three. The paco taco, the Chicken fried chicken, and chicken Melensia. Omg so so good! These tacos are pretty large. I couldn't finish three but it's a better deal to get three instead of 2. We also had the bartenders special margarita that night. It wasn't much different from a regular margarita except it has an orange slice. The service was excellent. The atmosphere is awesome and the price is good. I'm a new fan and will be returning FOR SURE!   Also, make a reservation."}
{"text":"Just a classic tex mex place. It's well priced, great service, and hidden away. I only went cause someone told me about it, if they hadn't I wouldn't have known it was tucked away in one of the busiest parts of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best Tex Mex place in the south east. I am here every weekend and the food is always outstanding and the service is fast, friendly, and efficient. If you haven't eaten here, then you haven't lived."}
{"text":"On a warm summer afternoon, there are only a few things that are more soul satisfying than chips and salsa, chicken fajitas and an ice cold margarita! This restaurant rightfully has \"tequila\" in their name, because they make one sick firecracker margarita!! Made with jalapeño infused tequila and lime juice, it's one of the most refreshing drinks I've had... with a kick!! (I think I may have finally found my favorite beverage.) For those of you who aren't afraid of spicy foods and drinks, this is definitely something you ought to try! Enough about the margarita! Now moving on to the food... I ordered a pretty standard dish; the chicken fajitas. This is usually my first choice in Mexican restaurants, because it's a safe choice, and usually sets the expectation for how good the other items on their menu might be; it's a good benchmark for me. Given that the fajitas were quite good, I'm definitely going back to try some of the more interesting items on their menu like the chimichangas and bbq shrimp tacos! Mmmm... I'm already looking forward to another glass (or two) of the Firecracker Margarita! =)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the mood for Mexican . Thanks to google , we found Paco taco on Morrison blvd . The waitress was very nice . She was pleasant and attentive . We decided to skip the appetizers and go straight to the entrees . We ordered the shrimp fajitas and the roasted vegetables enchilada . The fajitas were good , the standard fajitas you find in any Mexican restaurant. However , we were very disappointed with the enchilada . It was very doughy, the roasted vegetables lack the taste and the beans overwhelmed the plate . The only good thing  on that plate were the empanadas . The good service made up for that enchilada . We might consider coming back ."}
{"text":"For starters, I wonder why I have only been here twice since living near by for two years? Paco's was busy during our late dinner visiting time, however both hostesses were pleasant and in good moods, took our information and then enthusiastically confirmed that it would be fine if we waited at the bar (about a twenty minute wait we were told). Before we could even order our drinks at the bar, the sweet and extremely polite hostess came up and said \"miss your table is ready\".  So that was maybe a five minute wait, if that. Nice surprise because we were both very hungry! ;)  We were seated in a booth in the downstairs corner. The ambiance is casual and warm in the seated sections allowing you the opportunity to relax, but there are also TVs at and around the bar for those who want to come and just catch a game and have a drink.  The waitress was timely, polite, and patient with my boyfriend who comically tends to take forever to choose his meal. Meanwhile, we ordered margaritas-the watermelon summer one is spectacular! Just the right amount of flavor and liquor, goes down so crisp and easy it could be dangerous. Chips and salas were ever-flowing and fresh. The only complaint here for me is that the chips were pretty salty. But I applaud the freshness of both chips and salsa, and the spice kick in the salsa is just the right amount! The salsa is the perfect texture, not too chunky and not too watery.  The menu has options for vegetarian or GF, which is what I look for now as another way to bump a review up in stars. They have veggie fajitas, fiesta bowls, veggie enchiladas, corn tortilla options, etc. I had the fiesta bowl with no protein added. It was a generous amount of food, looked lovely and colorful and the avocado was just amazing on it. Everything was cooked well and tasted fresh. My boyfriend had three tacos: turkey, beef, shrimp. He loved how they tasted with the only complaint being slightly dry. He has previously had the fajitas which remain his favorite.   Overall it is a nice dining experience with no complaints. Food is fresh, people are kind, staff works together to refill water/chips/salsa/remove plates, drinks are amazing, and they do have a cute little patio out front. This is the kind of place you keep coming back to because you know you can get good food. We will return and I look forward to trying new things on the menu each time."}
{"text":"Good family friendly classic Mexican restaurant. I get takeout almost every week. I love the fajitas and the ones I love are the ones you get to put together yourself."}
{"text":"Big tequila selection. Terrible food. Bad, no, REALLY BAD Tex-Mex. everything was cold and sick."}
{"text":"I went back for a second visit, and I was again totally impressed by the level of service. I was also impressed this time by the food! My Cadillac chicken was phenomenal, and my friend had a salad which she said was great. I will be coming back to Pacos, and soon."}
{"text":"I tried something other than the tacos!! I finally did it!   Pacos has never let me down; I can always rely on this place to be a consistent win for dinner. The lady and I walked in at around 7pm and they told us it would be about a 15 minute wait. ...orrr we could just take a seat at the bar, or one of the barside 2 tops with full service. Yea, we'll go with that.  We were immediately given plates, chips and salsas, and had our drink order taken (Their margaritas are the bomb, make sure to ask for their daily special, ours were the No Name for $5). After multiple visits getting their wonderful tacos, I ventured to order the Fiesta Bowl, which was basically a 'skinny' burrito with cabbage instead of lettuce (which was really great!).  I don't think I've reviewed here before, so please don't get me wrong, the tacos are AWESOME. But it felt good to try something new.  ... And now I can say I've done it and I don't have to do it again and I can back to tacos thankyouverymuch.  Always good service. Always good food. Always leftovers. How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"I have been craving tacos & found this place today.. I ordered 2 Tanked Up grilled fish tacos with red rice, black beans and 2 house margaritas... Everything was delicious.. The chips and salsa they give as an appetizer was on point as well.."}
{"text":"Yes I am definitely a fan...a place to experience a little of mexico."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Food, ambience and service are beyond good. Try their house margarita!! If you go during weekends, may take some time to get a table."}
{"text":"Wait with a reservation: very long on a Friday night   Service: pretty good. Friendly staff but took a while to take our orders.   Food: excellent. I had the taco salad and would definitely order it again.   Drinks: margaritas were super strong. I'm average when it comes to alcohol tolerance but 2 margaritas did me in."}
{"text":"It has been a while since we ate here, on a whim decided to give it another try and we were glad we did. We went at prime time Saturday night and they were BUSY, luckily we snagged two seats at the bar. I started with the \"no name margarita\" love they use fresh made sour instead of pre-made, you can really tell a difference. We started with the queso blaco which was very good.. creamy and had peppers in it which was a nice touch. For dinner I opted for the small chopped salad, BF ordered the two taco place with crunchy beef and soft brisket (for me!) with charro beans as the sside. The small chopped salad was HUGE... I had enough for the next day, nice and fresh with lots of veggies and chick peas (love them!). The ground beef was well seasoned and nice and juicy.. the brisket was a little salty, I will say we do not use a lot of salt so I would guess its at a \"normal\" restaurant food level... it was very tender and flavorful. BF said the charro beans were really good but I was too stuffed to try~"}
{"text":"Service was great. Fish taco was good. Not a fan of the mystery cheese in the quesadilla."}
{"text":"Wait staff was friendly, we were served very quickly and the menu/drink specials were explained well to us. Had a great margarita deal on Thursdays. Margaritas were good, a little sour so drinking more than one is hard but good for the first one. Love how you are able to mix the tacos, I tried the wood grilled chicken, shrimp, and calamari and all three were delicious, and I had a few leftovers."}
{"text":"This is one of my FAVS to eat at and to take friends to from out of town. The place is ALWAYS PACKED, but I must say they get people in and seated quickly AND we have NEVER been rushed to order, eat, leave. Tge foods are all excellent. The spicy shrimp tacos with black beans and a mojito, of course. My friend had the steak fajita that smelled scrupmtious. His 'house' margarita' was odd tasting but not awful. They offered to replace it, but he declined.  The restaurant is crowded but not too rowdy/noisy that two people out on date night can't hear one another. The servers all know their menus well and are friendly. I will be a frequent flyer here."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I thought it was awesome. Great low carb options on the menu, specified in the title as such. It was super packed in here when I walked in, but the bar tender was surprisingly really attentive. Great margaritas too! Only complaint is the lack of specials and dirty bar. They didn't clean the old people's food completely off and were too busy to do it. Other than that 5/5!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place serving flavorful Tex Mex. got in on Sunday evening so not much wait time. But still it was near full.   Chips were really good - crispy without being greasy. Salsa was flavorful but slightly salty. Appetizer of yucca fries was good. Perfectly seasoned yucca fries with creamy ranch dressing.    Entree was vegetarian enchilada with black bean sauce- mild but very seaso"}
{"text":"When I pulled into the parking lot, I noticed that the Paco's Tacos is in the old Manzetti's building.  Flashbacks of their delicious salads and bread came to mind. It was a warm evening, and I was able to score outdoor seating for my friend and me.  We were given chips and salsa.  The salsa had nice heat, but there was something thick and sweet about it.  The menu is meat heavy.  But, I ordered the Too Big Taco Salad without meat.  Wow!  It came with greens, queso, black beans, cheese, corn shaved off of the cob, tossed in a Ranch like dressing.  It also featured tortilla chips nestled under the greens.  Kind of like eating nachos and salad simultaneously.  Very filling.  I may have finished half of it and then our server promptly removed it.  He didn't ask me if I was finished, but probably noting my diminutive size, he figured that I should be.  In retrospect, I wish that I had asked for a box.  However, it may have been one of those dishes that doesn't keep well.  The background music appeared to be mostly country.  Not to my liking, but it provably suits a Tex-Mex place. So, I had a bit of a Manzetti's salad flashback.  I think that I will I order that same dish again when I return."}
{"text":"Excellent Tex-Mex. Fantastic brisket. Some very creative options on the menu. Good top-shelf margarita too!  As a solo diner from out of town, the staff made me feel welcome. Excellent service on all three of my visits."}
{"text":"I have definitely written a review on PTT's before but for some reason it isn't popping up!  So, out of pure bitterness I am going to keep this review short and to the point.  The best thing about this restaurant is what they could be in theory.  Creative tacos, great/fresh side items, housemade dressings, etc etc..But really everything is just OK in my opinion.  The tableside guacamole is incredible but that isn't enough to keep me as a repeat customer.    The smoked chicken taco was okay, a little bland.  The pulled pork taco was decent but a little tough and once again, bland.  The side options are solid considering you typically only get lard...I mean refried beans...so I did enjoy my black beans and rice!  Overall--I think Paco's is okay.  They are a good alternative to traditional Mexican places and we don't have very many \"tex-mex\" places in Charlotte so I give them credit.  I don't think they are that great but they will satisfy a craving in a pinch I suppose."}
{"text":"Great foods and service. Got the pacos taco ( I think that the name) quite spicy... :') the waiter was nice (thanks for the water, really saved my life). Foods could been better, but overall it is still a good mex restaurant to go to.. more Tex then Mex. but still good!"}
{"text":"After a shiner beer dinner trip, a few hours at the bar trip, and a few just dinner trips - it's definitely a fully rounded review, but I'm pretty sure it would have sounded the same a few months back.  The food, is delish. The paco's taco (brisket) is just divine, as are both of the shrimp tacos. i think the campechana is awesome - and my mother (a ceviche expert) agreed. They have awesome food specials at the bar, and they have frito pie. (though I have yet to try it, the fact that it is on the menu makes me happy) Even their free chips and (both) salsas don't disappoint. They aren't perfect, and some items I've liked much more than others, but nothing has been \"bad\".  Now to the important part - the booze. a lovely selection of shiner (two or three on tap and then a few bottled) and a (slowly) rotating selection of infused tequilas complete their full bar and tons of tequila. I'm a fan of the three-pepper infused one which tastes fab alone, in a bloody maria, or in their firestarter (or something to the same tune) margarita. oh, their margaritas - I've had a couple different ones and I like all of them, especially the one that's on special that night.   What keeps this from being 5 stars is the service, and maybe a little of the ambiance. The amount of fajita plates ordered is ridiculous, and kind of makes me feel like I'm at Chili's. Not really their fault, I guess, but the constant sizzling and smoking can be distracting. The bartenders have always been great and friendly, but sometimes service has been a miss. In my book, there is a window for great service, but asking if I'm doing okay too many times in a certain time frame can be just as bad as never coming back to check in. I guess at Paco's I'm usually over-served(?), and more than once by a server who reaaaally shouldn't have chugged that second red bull right before her shift started. But hey, my water glass was continually filled to the rim, my drinks kept coming, and seconds after my food hit the window it was at the table - so I can't complain too much."}
{"text":"I'm really into tacos.   Like, if I could have tacos every meal, I think I'd be really happy with that decision. Do you know how much you can do with taco ingredients? LITERALLY everything is an ingredint for a taco.   I digress. Paco's is ALWAYS packed. One turn off, we made a reservation for 8pm on a Wednesday and we still waited 15 minutes for a table. If you make a reservation, why are you waiting when you're seating walk-ins? That doesn't make sense to me. With four people, it shouldn't be hard to find a spot for us to sit because this place is huge.  With awesome vegetarian options. I was pleased with Paco's except for when they forgot my stuffed jalapeno. I opted for two tacos, one shrimp and the other fish. Shimp was by far the more supperior taco. Just for this taco alone. I will be back. Can't wait for my stuffed jalpeno next time, too."}
{"text":"We arrived at 6:30 and was told 25-30 minutes so we ventured to the bar, where chips and salsa were brought to us immediately. The chips were light, warm, and fresh with a great salsa, and the margarita's were awesome. After about 40 minutes I checked with the hostess and we were the next table to be called. However, the wait time was over one hour and fourth-five minutes, the place was packed! We are the Paco's tacos which were great & a combination of a shrimp and chicken taco. The Paco's tacos were awesome, and the chicken was good, however, I'd pass on the shrimp next time. The sides, cole slaw, rice and beans were all good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife has finally found a place that I will agree to go to when she's craving Mexican food.  I'm usually out on all Mexican food places, I just don't get it... but this place was decent.    I had a fish taco, a BBQ taco, and a ground beef one.  The BBQ one, which I believe was the actual \"paco's taco\" - was hella good.  The fish one was good too.    The chips were meh, honestly, if they were to make their own, my review goes up a star."}
{"text":"My wife and I couldn't decide on a place to eat lunch near Southpark so we searched Yelp and found this gem. She and I both grew up in Charlotte so we still thought of this as Manzetti's - an awesome restaurant with a lot of memories. We were very pleasantly surprised that, despite the very different cuisine, Paco's Tacos was just as delicious and good a restaurant.  I had a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese enchilada and it was amazing. I loved the fact that it was not enormous but a perfect amount of food (so sick of all the ginormous servings, like at the Cheesecake Factory). The chips were a bit too salty but the guacamole- made fresh at the table - was wonderful and balanced it out. My wife had a margarita and it made her very happy - all I cared about. The cost wasn't bad - about $10/entree - especially given the area.   To put the cherry on top, the service was excellent. Consistent, smiling, pleasant, not wanting for anything. And the bathroom was clean and smelled fresh - a very welcome change from a lot of establishments.   Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today, absolutely loved the atmosphere and the food was great. I had the chopped salad, ordered the small size which was huge! Also tried the shrimp taco, it was really good. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is always great, the atmosphere is amazing, and I love the food. I tried tacos, soup and enchiladas so far - it was all great. I do recommend getting a reservation, though we were able to get three seats at the bar on Saturday night right away last time I went there with friends (wait time without reservation would be an hour)."}
{"text":"Pat our server was really nice and friendly. I've been here before and was excited to introduce my husband to the the restaurant. The food had no flavor. It was hot--which is great, but there was literally no flavor at all. With ingredients like cilantro, tomato, pork,and fish, you would expect SOME flavor. If you want mediocre bland food but the texmex decor, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"First time, food was really good. My wife and I both had tacos, they let us switch out stuff we didn't like, very good. Had black beans and again were good. The coleslaw wasn't very good wasn't impressed, but wasn't the reason I went there. Wait staff was also very nice and helpful and explained everything to us."}
{"text":"I met up with my friend and her coworkers. They had been here on the patio but I am the late worker.  Apparently I have walked straight into a nightmare. No one greeted me, even thought there were plenty of servers walking by. Yes, the rest of the table looked pretty \"done\" but shouldn't the server know that there's a new person here? Say hi, ask if I want anything, pretend you care. When I finally had a server, I asked what is their drink specials, and her response was \"I don't think I can serve you.\"  WHAT??  She offered me a water.  Turned out they have denied service to the entire table because they have a one drink an hour limit. WHAT?? Mind you I was with people who just got off work, including a CFO of the company.  We were not some youngins making troubles. Plus, I just got there, obviously haven't had any drink.  We left shortly after, still baffled. Which restaurant doesn't serve their patrons? I guess one that doesn't want any business."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Mexican places I've been to in Charlotte. I have a lot of food allergies (peanuts, nuts, and shellfish) and this place took it very seriously. The manager came over to make sure everything I ordered was something I could eat. Plus I don't often get to eat chips at Mexican places because they fry the chips in the same thing as the shellfish, but this place had a separate fryer for the chips. I was in heaven and literally could not stop eating the chips. I will definitely be visiting here a lot more once I officially move back to Charlotte.   I also got the queso with the chips and it was really good; however, I feel like there wasn't as much queso as I would get at other places.   Overall this was a great experience and the perfect lunch spot!  UPDATE: I recently went back here and was reminded how much I LOVE their guacamole and queso. My friend and I are already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"We had a reservation at Paco's before a show at the Filmore.  Coming from out of town and in need of tacos, we went for the place that we could get a reservation.  Paco delivered well.  I had three tacos: The Paco Taco, the Al Pastor, and the shrimp taco.  Shrimp was my least favorite.  Large well stuffed tacos.  My wife had the enchilada sampler.  She enjoyed all but the veggie one.  Great services.  Food was good, but not the best tacos I've ever had.  Pricier than a regular mexican place, with similar flavors."}
{"text":"Nice and Flavorful Taco in South Park.   Place is a tex mex flair with a massive selection of Tequila.  If i wasn't so deathly afraid of tequila, after one previous bad night a long, long ago,  it would have been neat to sample the margaritas and shots .  I came here for lunch and it was really nice. My strategy was just to get tacos and no fillers. I got 3 single tacos and it was the perfect amount for lunch.  I highly recommend getting the standard PACO's taco. You'll be happy with your choice.  Then branch out and get one of the crazier flavors."}
{"text":"My lovely wife has never before had a fish taco and after hearing me tell her over and over again that it wasn't what she though it was, and that she would really enjoy it, she finally relented. And yep, she loved it. So much so that she now wants to go back to Paco's almost immediately.  Service was very good - we let Shauna pick our tacos for us, as long as there was at least one fish taco on each plate. Good move! She asked some questions about our preferences for spiciness and allergies and got it taken care of.  Yep, we'll go back!"}
{"text":"Paco's had excellent service, the waitress was bubbly and very attentive. My family and I all tried different tacos and we all were satisfied. The food was tasteful and very filling; they sure do fill up your plate! Overall I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love mexican, but i'll be the first to admit that  most texmex joints are not that different from each other. Paco's was different. I had the chicken fajitas and my wife had the taco's (fish, brisket & chicken).  My fajitas were some of the i've had and my wife loved the taco's. Paco's is probably the best texmex i've had in charlotte, so I definitely reccomend them. . Be sure to call ahead for reservations on a weekend night...they're busy!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once, and I'll be back for more!  I came in for lunch, never knowing this place was hidden near the South Park Mall behind some other stores and shops.  Chips and salsa: Pretty yummy, and the salsa had a nice flavor and sutle heat to it.  Firestarter margarita: Jalapeño infused tequila, fresh lime juice and ginger beer. Great heat. The ginger beer gives it a very unique flavor... unlike any other jalapeno margarita I've had.   Paco's Taco: Brisket, caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce. The brisket full of flavor and piled high.   Turkey Club Carnitas: slow cooked shredded turkey, sliced avocado, shredded iceberg, jalapeno bacon, tomato and avocado ranch. The Yelp family was right once again. Wow, this is a great taco.  Charro beans: Don't get me wrong, I like black beans.... but I have to go with charro every time for my side.   Fajitas: Nothing beats the smell of the sizzling plate as it comes out... making all other people jealous that they didn't order it. Huge portion size and a giant plate of fresh toppings. This easily made for two meals.   I'm a huge fan of this place... and now so is my buddy Steve. He was super impressed by his first visit."}
{"text":"Great location, i got veggie tacos is pretty good the food menu have crazy names good experience  and service also super cold Beer"}
{"text":"You guys rock!  Work nearby and I always pop in for some tacos and a margarita or a beer.  Food is always great, service at the bar rocks.  Food comes out quickly too.  The Paco's taco and the chicken milanesa taco are probably my favorite.  Keep it up y'all!"}
{"text":"Always good food. Love the enchiladas. They're definitely a bit greasy but this isn't a restaurant boasting of their healthy food options. That being said they have a great house chopped salad! Haha. My husband loves their margaritas. We've always had decently fast service and great meals! Couldn't think of any reasons as to why they shouldn't have 5 stars"}
{"text":"Went here last night during Charlotte restaurant week. We went with our friends. Atmosphere is ok. A bit loud but still enjoyable.  For the restaurant week menu they had the no name margarita to start with. We all got it frozen. It was a lot bigger than I anticipated so well worth it with the meal. Choice of appetizer was either queso or guacamole. 3 of us had the question and 1 the guac. Both were very tasty. Our waiter made sure to keep our chip bowl filled so we could enjoy the guac and queso. Second course was either a salad or chicken tortilla soup. We had both. Both tasted good. Main course was a choice of 4 different entrees. 3 of us got the choice of three tacos and one got the tipsy chicken. I really enjoyed the the turkey club carnita taco. It has some sort of jalapeno bacon in it and it was really good. For dessert the choice was either peanut butter chocolate pie or tres leches. 3 of us had the pie and 1 had the tres leches. The pie was really good as was the tres leches. If in the area I would stop into the restaurant again"}
{"text":"Not sure if I'm noticing a trend or not, but there seem to be many restaurants opening featuring what can be classified as \"street tacos.\"  Paco's has a particularly large assortment of street tacos that feature your choice of tortilla variety, fresh ingredients, and unique combinations.  First of all, I loved the chips, salsa, and guacamole here.  The guac is made at the table with your choice of typical ingredients and also your choice of consistency.  So my chuncky/spicy guac preference was definitely satsified.  I ordered three tacos, the best of which was probably the shrimp or shredded beef (i forget the exact name).  All you really need for a good street taco is well-seasoned meat, a unique topping (think cabbage or some other veggie), and a good sauce.  Paco's does all of these well and puts it on par with some of the great street taco-style mexican restaurants I frequent in Cincinnati.  As a side, the black beans were awesome.  I'd love to visit PAco's again to try the tequila selection, other tacos, or some of the other menu sections I didn't experience."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were fresh and delish. Had the shrimp tacos and chiken with bacon tacos, shrimp had a kick but both were yummy."}
{"text":"The place is a bit hard to find (look behind the Williams Sonoma!) but it's definitely worth a trip. The atmosphere is relaxed with a really nice large bar. We were easily able to get seats at the bar at 8:00 PM on a Tuesday.  The bartender was nice enough to create custom margaritas for us and they were DELICIOUS! (but expensive...$11 each!) I definitely recommend getting a margarita with their jalapeño infused tequila.   The salsa was fantastic, but the queso was just OK. Chips were a little undercooked but the staff was great at refilling our basket! My fiancé and I shared the combo fajitas (chicken and steak) and it was more than enough food for the two of us. We subbed black beans for the standard charro beans and I was happy we did.  The staff was really friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about their products so I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant and think their food is very good. I have tried many different items on the menu and found them to be very good. Their chips and salsa are some of the best I have ever had.  The drinks are an issue in this establishment. Beer is reasonable but their wine prices are way to high. Louis Martini Cabernet for $12.99 a glass? The whole bottle in a retail store cost $15 and the wholesale price is around $10-$12 per bottle. So I figure they have a 4x to 5x markup on a bottle which is outrageous. The same issue exists with some of their other drinks as indicated in other reviews.   Stick with the Tex Mex and Beer when visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was really good. My fiancé and I visited Charlotte last weekend. I had a grilled chicken taco and their signature Paco taco. Both very good. Spicy red rice and black beans had a good Spanish flavor. The waiter recommended I try the Paco el dorado which is a margarita they serve which was amazingly delicious. Overall quite pleased with our first visit here!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken bowl and it was great, good flavor and price right.  Host and bartender were really friendly. It is really beneficial they stay open between lunch and dinner, so hours of operation are very convenient."}
{"text":"This is becoming my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.  Great food and service, and always have a good Margarita drink special."}
{"text":"Paco's Tacos was good. Thats really all there is to it. Service was excellent. I really liked my first margarita but my second one was almost un drinkable. The food was ok. Ultimatley if i feel like having a burrito, ill skip the drive to South Park and take my chances of getting lysteria from Chipotle. There was nothing wrong with Pacos Tacos but nothing really right about it either."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte from Jacksonville Fl to see my sister and her family..just before this I was reading a list of the top tacos in America..because i love tacos, this doesnt seem like something strange to read for me..well i told my sister that while i was in town i must eat at Pacos, cause they have the number four tacos in the US, also the name is super fun to say and the menu made me drool a little! We got there around 2 o clock in the afternoon on New Years Eve and only waited a few moments before we were shown to our table..the energy here is really awesome, and theres a bright bar showcasing all the libations available..we were brought some chips and salsa right away and then met our server David (last name Pacheco..theres more than one David here) he was super quick and attentive and was able to answer questions for me with no hesitation or giving me a really long winded non answer..i learned that the salsa is made in house, and he also was able to direct me to a fabulous local IPA, that of  course I cant remember the name of..soon we were placing orders that all consisted of tacos..and also some table side guacamole..the guac was so good..and im really picky about guac..my sister and nephew really liked it as well..then our meals came, and everything looked oh so fantastic..i got a soft shake down shrimp which had crispy plump shrimp and some shredded cabbage, pico de gallo and chipotle ranch..i also had a soft smokey and the brisket (cute name!) it had the most tender amazing brisket and some pico de gallo..they were both amazing and flavorful..the pico de gallo and chipotle ranch really take things to a whole different taste level..also with the tacos come rice and beans (i chose refried, you can get charro or black) and i pointed out to my nephew that by looking at the crisp brown cheese on top of the beans you can tell they werent just heated up in a microwave..also the rice was really on point as well..normally the rice and beans are kind of just meh when you get them as part of a meal, this was so good i ate it all! We were checked on and got drink refills very often, and we really enjoyed all the food we had..price point was really good for the type of quality that it is..I will try to head here when I am in town next!!"}
{"text":"We always have such a great time at Paco's Tacos. The people are great, the food is good and plentiful, and it's just such a nice place to go and relax. I like sitting outside and the walk to Williams Sonoma is always good to work off the wonderful food. Good job and I'll see you soon."}
{"text":"I have been to Pacos probably 4 or 5 times and am never disappointed. Some of my favorites include the Paco taco, skirt steak taco, and the Enchilada de Dennis. The best thing we discovered is that you can also order just the taco or enchilada for $4 or $4.50 so if you don't want the rice and beans. Usually 2 items fills me up. Also I have never had bad service here which is a plus. The chips and salsa are always crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"The drinks, chips and salsa were amazing.  I had the shrimp tacos and they were ok, but the best and not the worst.  The rice was not good.  My friend ordered sauteed veggies and rice, not good.  Veggies were very over cooked/ burnt. Had to ask for them to re cook another order...if it wasn't for the drink(texas mule and strawberry rhubarb margarita) and chips I would not give a 3 star...those were a 5 star"}
{"text":"Ive been here several times, it never gets old! Service is fast and they keep bring chips and salsa. Prices are very reasonable. The food, drinks, flavor, atmosphere was very pleasing, presentation of the food was Excellent. Offering something for the whole family. My husband and I enjoyed our meal. The shop was both clean and tidy, having plenty seating. The hostess/ waitress was attentive at all times. Staff members there greeted us in/ out when we left. The food was more than filling, loved all the dishes thus far. We will certainly be returning soon and would recommend this facility. Im sure everything is a must try! Great meal..."}
{"text":"We came Last Saturday night and the wait was an hour and 45 minutes!?!  We regretfully had not made a reservation.  Back today (Monday) and no problem at 4 pm. Chris is our server and has a great big smile and is happy to meet a couple of Texans!  She has made us Guacamole tableside (fabulous) and here are my heart healthy chicken tacos on lettuce? All in all, outstanding!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Salsa had great flavor. It was a little hot for my son, so he mixed it with the mild tomatillo salsa. Cheese dip was great too! I had some kind of turkey carnitas taco on a whole wheat tortilla with bacon and avocado on it, DELICIOUS! Top shelf margarita was $10 tonight (Thurs) and well worth it! We will definitely go back!! So nice it is just 3 miles from home too."}
{"text":"Visited Paco's last week with my family. The service was great from the time we walked in the door. Add to that great food and margaritas and you have a wonderful Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"We had 6pm reservations for a birthday dinner last night.  We were promptly seated and our server, Darwin G, took great care of us.  He recommended drinks and had a favorite dish that I tried and loved.  Darwin was attentive, had a great personality and immediately noted that the wrong plate had been delivered to our table and corrected it.  The food was delicious but the evening was so much better because of the great service.  Thanks Darwin!  And thanks for finding my phone when I left it behind too...."}
{"text":"The food here is so good. It is also a wonderful place for anyone with a gluten intolerance to visit. They have a pretty robust GF menu and the food is delicious. We also had really great service! Make reservations if you come on a weekend night!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and WOAH!! Best tacos I've ever had. Hands down. Ordered the Chicken fried steak and oh my lanta... What a fantastic dish.   Had SUCH an amazing waitress (Ashley) who made the entire experience memorable. She's a veteran at what she does and completely genuine. Her attitude was positive and full of energy the entire time which was appreciated. She recommend the best margaritas and convinced me to try a palette of shots. (She repeated the name of all the shots at least 5x and for the life of me I cannot remember.)   Will absolutely come back to this location and specifically ask for Ashley with hopes to see her again.   On top of her perfect customer service the food was beyond expectations. Check them out! You won't be mad."}
{"text":"Knocked out by their killer gluten-free steak fajitas.  Went here with friends last night and had a top notch experience.  The wait staff was great, as was the food and expansive list of tequila offerings.  My fiancé said they have the best tacos he's had.  I have already made plans to go back!"}
{"text":"Updating my previous review of Paco's Tacos due to an interesting development..  As I indicated originally they did not have a real hot sauce option.  Stop the presses!  They have a Ghost Chili sauce now that is.. dare I say.. sweet?!?  Seriously it tastes like dried ghost chilis, reconstituted with vinegar and mixed with honey - there is probably more to it than that but it doesn't matter - all you need to know is this stuff packs some heat.  Seriously, go light on it if you are not used to very spicy food.  Also the carnitas have become my new favorite, I'm quite certain they are some of the best in town.  Don't take my word for it though, try 'em."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in Charlotte. All the tacos are terrific and they have an amazing tequila selection. Fun and knowledgeable staff too."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Their El Derado margarita is by far the best margarita I've ever had and definitely worth the hefty price tag. Their food is consistently good and we've not once had an issue with their friendly staff. Best of all, they are extremely gluten free friendly with a big menu of options."}
{"text":"We came to Paco's for a quick lunch before checking into our hotel. My girlfriend had the pineapple mint margarita, and I had the blood orange one. Both were good! We also enjoyed a small queso and a Paco's Taco. A friend recommended Paco's, and she made a great recommendation."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that is very affordable, in a beautiful area of Charlotte, and serves delicious food!! I've been here a few times and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I plan to try each and every margarita on the menu! The service is always friendly and the portions are huge. My date had a steak fajita after seeing it at a neighboring table as soon as we sat down. I was just glad that I wouldn't have to wait to order since I already knew what I wanted, shrimp and fish tacos!   Your bowls of salsa and chips are constantly refilled before they even get a chance to be emptied. I've been to other Mexican restaurants that will charge you for salsa and chips, and there will not be refills.  I love that they have a separate door for to go orders. Now that I live close by, I'll definitely become a regular."}
