{"text":"Their peshawari karahi and brain masala is the best! Still some work needs to be done on other Items. But peshwari karahi and brain masala is very close to Pakistani taste"}
{"text":"Arranged for catering to be done from here for a work lunch--great experience! Affordable, lots of variety, and lots of quantity! Very cooperative. The shahi tukra was amaaaazing."}
{"text":"BE AWARE. There was literally a dead roach in my biryani. Beyond nasty. I would never recommend this place to my worst enemy after such an experience."}
{"text":"This is the best karahi style restaurant outside of Lahore. Karahi is actually a cast iron wok which is used to cook curries which usually include a protein but can be veg. They are also served in the same pot which is the best part. This stuff is like crack for me. I refuse to leave the restaurant until the pot has been licked clean. 

You are best to stick to the karahi food, that's what they do. The other stuff is great but not what you come here for. The food will be a bit spicy but that's the culture. 

I really recommend :

1) dark meat chicken karahi 
2) kebob karahi with beef 
3) paneer karahi 

All are served with naan bread which is made fresh, you can just tell by the texture. 

The restaurant is not huge but they have big hearts. I can tell from their serving sizes. The place is also ran by the owners who I believe are the chefs or atleast they play a big role in the kitchen. The staff is also consistent and do their best to accommodate. 

If you are looking to try something authententic, this is a great place to go. There is usually enough parking  and I have never had waits times longer than a few minutes. (I also happen to go there once a week. It's my crack remember)"}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto in August and I found this restaurant from web searches. Their Karahi is amazing and also their kebabs I would give their food 5 out of 5. It is a must visit restaurant when you are in Toronto. It is not a fancy sit down place and it's a bit small but reasonably clean given the area it is located in."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff. We went to the restaurant on a Saturday night for the first time after looking at the reviews. This place was packed. Even though we had reservations for 13 people we had to wait about 15 to 20 mins to get a table. But once we got the table everything was fantastic. 
We ordered bihari kabab, chicken karahi, and brain masala which were all delicious. The best chicken karahi and bihari kabab in GTA so far! Also ordered a biryani which wasn't the best but it was ok. The naans were soooo good; they brought them in intervals so they were always hot and fresh out the kitchen.

The staff provided an amazing service, specially considering how busy that place was. 

Will definitely come here again and would strongly recommend others to go there as well if you want authentic pakistani food."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time one Saturday night with my wife and 3 year old. We wanted to have a curry and roti, but at a nice place. This shop was just perfect; it's not posh or pretentious, but down to earth and honest. 

The other yelp reviews were quite accurate; food is cooked to order and worth the 15min wait. We had the chicken karahi which came with naan and raita, chicken tikka which is not supposed to be spicy, mango lassi and plain rice.

Overall we loved the food! Chicken karahi was to die for and was flavourful but not overly spicy. It's bone in chicken cooked in a tempered curry sauce. Sauce was not heavy or creamy but just with a body. Didn't have a strong taste of cloves or star anise that I have tasted in some Indian curries. Great witH the naan. The chicken tikka was grilled just right; slightly smokey and well marinated in a touch of tumeric. I liked it though my daughter who is used to Chinese food didn't! She stuck with the naan and mango lassi ( which was a generous portion and you could taste the real mango).

Tips - there are items that are not shown on the menu like 'plain rice' and roti. So ask the server. I feel that they handle lots of take outs or regulars who know what they want. So if u are a newbie, ask away.

Only downside is that toilet does not have change table for babies.

{"text":"Worth the drive from Mississauga! We ordered the brain masala, lamb karhai and chicken pakora. Brain masala was fantabulous, pakora was okay and karhai was delicious but the meat had a smell to it which is common if you get lamb anywhere so won't hold that against them,Naans were oh my goodness so good!

Will definitely return, good food and polite customer service , hope they maintain their standards"}
{"text":"I have no words to express my satisfaction and praise this restaurant for the food and the service (the owner was the nicest person ever, he comes to every table personally to suggest/help you out with your order and inquires about the service multiple times)...Only I could say is it was like I was back in Karachi...anything they serve is top notch from naan to all the dishes...all my Pakistani/Indian friends I recommended this restaurant to went there twice in a span of two weekends just cuz they couldnt decide what to order and what not to cuz every dish was delicious..Enough said!"}
{"text":"This place is great went there today with my son, who is a picky eater got the biryani chicken and lamb spicy...hahaha he loved it...the rice and meat is cooked to perfection...loved it"}
{"text":"Here is what I think:

Place: Small and busy.
Service: Good
Food-Karahi (Chicken. Goat needs 24 hour notice):  3.0/5.0
Food-Seekh Kabab: 4.5/5.0
Naan:5.0/5.0
Chiken Tikka Pieces: 4.0/5.0
Raita: 1.0/5.0 (Silver Spoon has better raita)
Salad: 2.0/5.0 (very small quantity considering we ordered 5 dishes + Nans)

Overall, good to have one more choice."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed on my today's visit. Though the tables were available and it wasn't many people waiting....the food came to our table after around 45 mins after placing the order. The curry which it's famous for Karahi Chicken Boneless was really awful. Felt like I was eating something that's stale !! 
Hygiene is never priority for this place. Total waste of time and money !!"}
{"text":"the first time I ate here, it was just my husband and I, and we got the boneless chicken karahi and keema biryani. it was so amazing that my husband immediately commented that my DAD, who being Pakistani himself has very high standards for what is considered good Pakistani food, would even like this place. round two, we brought my parents, brother and some family friends visiting from Dallas here for lunch. 

we got lamb karahi, boneless chicken Peshawari karahi, brain masala, lahori channa and bihari kabab. let's just talk about their karahi for a second. considering that this dish is the restaurant's namesake, it completely lives up to the expectation. the karahi is brought out in actual karahis, first of all, and you can tell it's made fresh in individual batches. there is plenty of meat and it's coated in masala - not at all oily, like how karahis tend to be at other restaurants. the channa is super authentic and fresh, the brain very decadent and spicy, and the Bihari kabab tender with just the right amount of char on it. the naan here comes out hot and fresh out of the tandoor.

the service here  was supremely attentive. my family can be really high maintenance and has a lot of demands (for example, my brother wanted aaloo paratha and they were out, so the chef made us aaloo naan!) and Sara, the person who served us, was so courteous and very charming, made us laugh. the chef even came out to talk to us at my dad's request. if you're Pakistani and you want to eat some GOOD Pakistani food, cooked with care and made FRESH, go to Karahi Point."}
{"text":"One of the best Pakistani resturants in Toronto. Every dish at this restaurant tastes great especially their chicken karahi. I am going to visit their new location soon!"}
{"text":"I have been to their old location a few times and it was always a good experience. However, my friends and I decided to go to the new location and it was absolutely amazing. The food was excellent. The service was great. Gill was our server and he was very professional and had great customer service skills. The new location is beautiful. Thank you again Gill for the great service!"}
{"text":"I juggled between 3 and 4 stars but decided on giving 4 for all the times i have had roll parathas from this resturaunt. This places is typically packed on weekend evenings."}
{"text":"Best peshwari Karahi chicken ever.  It's absolutely delicious.  A lot of flavor and not overly spicy.  It's just right.  The naans are also amazing.  I would highly recommend it.  Chicken biryani was good too.  Flavorful and the rice was truly basmati, thin and delicious.  I would always get the karahi here!  The place is a little small though so I wish they would expand.  They were really busy when we came."}
{"text":"The best authentic karahi chicken I have had in GTA. I have been there twice in the last one month and had food catered for my small get together. In- restaurant atmosphere is basic design,but the food makes up for it...catering experience was outstanding, arrived on time! Infact I got a call when the food left their premises.
We have tried their seekh Kabab, their new entry dhaha Kabab, karahi chicken, both with and without bone, and daal. All delicious. Biryani leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Never go there. Dirty plates. Place is small and busy the employee and owner don't care about their customer. Ordered and waited for 60 mins and then left, food was not ready. Very poor customer service, non apologetic   staff and owner."}
{"text":"Best place for lunch in the area. Food is freshly made. Quickly served. And staff are genuinely nice."}
{"text":"Wow, this hit the spot. I am from Pakistani origin so I am a big critic when it comes to Pakistani food and this place ranked very high.

Me and my work buddies went in by lunch time to check this place out. I booked mark it on yelp when we were driving back from another place. 

The service was quite good, the server was helpful in explaining the menu and portion size of the dishes. They have a sign stating their will be a wait of about 15 to 20 mins as they cook everything fresh and Wow it was fresh and hot!.

So I ordered their Chicken Tikka Masala. The dish was hot and cooked to perfect, the portion size and pieces of boneless chicken were the right size and the naan just came out of the tandoor so it was fresh as well. The dishes also came with rita and some onions...

Over all very exciting menu, I will be back to try more.

For my Muslim peeps! This area is common to serve halal meat and They serve halal meat at this location mentioned in the store and on their menu."}
{"text":"Very yummy lamb karahi, Bihari kabab and naan. Takes. A while to cook but the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Me and  3 other friends were visiting Canada for a friend's wedding from NYC and planned to extend our trip a bit longer after his wedding, so booked a hotel in the area and randomly came across this Gem of a restaurant. After full day of traveling and not eating anything here was our first meal. Even though both of the host's heavily insisted on the Karahi (hence the name Karahi Point ; -) ) we were just not craving it we got the chicken and lamb/goat biryani, chicken charga, and chicken kabab. Food was absolutely amazing but a bit pricey, which we didn't really didn't pay much thought to because we were on a vacation (everything is expensive when your on a vacation).

Recommendations: Biryani, Charga, Chicken Kabab, and the Karahi (as mentioned numerous time by the host's)"}
{"text":"How do I give half stars? I would really like to give a 4.5. This place is very fast becoming my favourite Pakistani restaurant in mississauga/ Etobicoke /Toronto combined. Their BBQ items are too legit to quit. Easily better than Lahore tikka house, BBQ tonite, and cafe de khan. Their Karhai??? . It is SO bomb diggity. The naans are amazing too! They are thinner than the other restaurants I've tried but still so soft, buttery, and so delicious. 

The place is not the fanciest sit down place but it's clean which is really important for me. My interactions with staff have always been super courteous. True desi style hospitality - they always make you feel welcomed and at home. Keep in mind that they do take a bit of time to get the food out (it really is freshly made, you can tell from the taste) so don't go here if you're super hungry!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! Don't judge the place by its look... 
Their paneer karahi was AMAZING!!! literally want to go back today again to buy more
Ate their mutton and chicken biryani ... Naan was very good and soft.
I took some left over paneer and ate it for brunch... It was still fresh and tasty... 
Better than other expensive Pakistani/Indian restaurants"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food served right in the Karahi! Didn't mind waiting at all. Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"I went with a large group of people and we were all shocked when the bill came! This place is better for small groups of people as the portions are small, the best dish is the classic chicken Karahi (white meat) without bones ($36.99). Kind of annoying that this doesn't come with naan or rice, I got garlic naan which was $3.99 each, it didn't have much garlic at all. I would say 1 Karahi feeds 2-3 people. Don't get me wrong... it's a really good curry but I think I can get something comparable for a quarter of the price. Service was okay. The overall space was surprisingly large."}
{"text":"Great Pakistani food. Good price as compare to portion of food. I would give them 5stars if they have good sitting arrangement and cleanness."}
{"text":"FINALLY found an authentic karahi experience! Note - I'm referring to the food and the vibe.
Do not expect this place to be a fancy sit down. But what it lacks in that dept, it makes up (and beyond) in terms of flavor. 

Served in an actual karahi (wok), the taste is unparalleled to any other restaurant in GTA that serves Karahi. The staff is polite and the food, extremely fresh (you have to wait 20-25mins) There are quite a few things on the menu - if I were them, I would scrap all other items and focus on their strongest point - the Karahis. I also love that they do half orders so you can explore multiple flavours! They've recently opened a new location too.

(Highly) Recco: tandoori roti, seekh kebab karahi, peshawari karahi - a large appetite followed by absolute bliss. The taste is bound to transport you to Pakistan"}
{"text":"We had long planned to try them out, and drove all the way from Mississauga to try them. We were 7, and ordered one and a half full lamb karahi, half chicken peshawari karahi, and bihari kebabs. The lamb karahi' was the best so far that I have had in canada. The chicken karahi seemed to be a complete mistake, and finally bihari kebabs that certainly compete with the best in Canada at Cafe D Khan. Raita (mixed yogurt), salad without onions (should have onions), and rotis were good. A star less for the chicken karahi, and the space. Overall it was a great experience, and will go again to try out other items on the menu, but in addition to lamb karahi."}
{"text":"Since my last review. Adil's Karahi Point has opened a new location in just 2 years at :
2201 Finch Ave. w, North York, ON M9M 2Y9. 416.749.2997.

They have acquired a previous Swiss Chalet location, with lots of room and party space. 

The fact that Karahi Point needed larger space is a proof of the authenticity and popularity of its extra ordinary Karahi, Grill, and Curries menu.

In my opinion, The Karahi (meats cooked in a Wok) menu that is a traditional Northern Pakistan dish Can not get any better than here  as compared  to all the Indo Pak restaurants that claim to serve this specialty, in Canada.

This larger space will cater to all those who invested a lot of time to wait to savour the authenticity of taste at the former location.

It will still take 20-30 minutes to serve fresh from the chef to the table, and it is worth it!"}
{"text":"What a great Pakistani restaurant. The karahi was as good as the karahi you find in Karachi. The wait was a big long but well worth it. Freshly made naans hit the spot. I would highly recommend this spot for karahi lovers."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Customer service was satisfactory however needs improvement. Not enough place for big parties. I brought 12 people and our seating area was crowded."}
{"text":"Most disgusting restaurant. 16$ for a little bit dark of meat. They call it half. Full is 25$ plus tax. Desperate to stay afloat as the restaurant is completely deAd . Next door was closed therefore forced to go to this dirty sula restaurant. Stomach ache and diarrhea after just about sums it all up."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! Had wait a long time for my order only to get someone else's order. Chicken karhai tasted like tomato sauce and nothing else. Naan were cold and dry.. Would never recommend this place to anyone neither would I go back. Also very less quantity for the money your paying."}
{"text":"For being a Pakistani restaurant that is as customer-focused as they are and for serving the most heavenly food on all the earth (nehari) I give extra points.  Very friendly people, very clean and comfortable environment, but best of all the steaming bowls of nehari goodness. I was floating on air.  Thanks Karahi Point!"}
{"text":"I have eaten better. It was not looking that it was freshly made. spices were also ordinary. I have eaten better in mississauga. I dont know why i drove all the way to eat at this place. I think Gazebo sweets in mississauga makes the best karahi. I wish them all the best"}
{"text":"Karahi chicken with bones was average.  I could feel that meat was boiled and than kept half cooked. It was any thing you can get in any Mississauga Pakistani restaurant. Only difference is that they give it in karahi. Prices were average.  Brain masala was also average and food temperature was also not right . I liked the naan they surved. Its a big restaurant and can accomodate large groups."}
{"text":"I love the Karahi here, it is very delicious and very nicely seasoned and very yummy."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome!!! Great food, new location on finch ave is amaZing!! Staff was super friendly and the food was phenomenally good!!! Must go!!! I will come back from U.S just to eat here!!"}
{"text":"I went to Karahi Point three nights ago and was pleasantly surprised to find brain masala in Toronto! The maghaz was just like how it is back home, the nehari was a bit of a miss but not too bad for Toronto standards either! If you are in a bit of a rush I'd suggest ordering over the phone before hand as they do prepare their foods fresh and it does take a good 15-20 minutes before it arrives at your table. Whilst the karahi is the speciality here we didn't have enough room to order it, but we do want to try it next time! It is served in the legit way, in the kadhai (wok) itself!"}
{"text":"The gravy is good but the chicken is never cooked properly.. Chicken is very rubbery..!! Been here twice.. Same thing every time.."}
{"text":"Great Karahi...best in the GTA! Service is pretty good, food is always fresh. I always enjoy my time here."}
{"text":"Not the best location but the food truly was amazing. One of the best Pakistani meals I've ever had.. Unbelievable delicious Tawa  Qeema and Brain Masala (although it doesn't sound appealing it was amazing).  Very nice and very friendly ladies working there. Very polite."}
{"text":"Part of the reason I used to miss Pakistan was the food.. I don't have that problem anymore thanks to discovering this place. The karhai here is the best karhai I've had in North America.. they always make it fresh and it's always amazing. If you're looking for authentic Pakistani food you have to give this place a visit! The restaurants at Gerard street and places in Mississauga  don't even come close to the quality and taste this place offers."}
{"text":"The 3rd time is the charm, or so they say. Ever since my friends from Karachi recommended this little place, I have been trying to come here. Once, I drove all the way and found it closed for Eid. Second time, it was the Canada Day long weekend. The third time, we made it and it was well worth the drive!

I messaged friendly owner Adil to alert him of my son's nut allergy and Adil replied promptly to reassure me.

We chose the chicken seekh kebab, a mutton biryani and a half order of the lamb karahi (included a small salad and 2 of the freshest naans I've ever tasted). Everything was yummy but the lamb karahi was truly scrumptious. So tender and flavourful! Just the thought of it is making me salivate. 

Next time I visit, I should try to drag my extended family so that we can order more items. Waiting to taste the brain masala curry and the paneer karahi..."}
{"text":"oh my God will never go there again Bad Service. They serve food in very very less QUANTITIES and they Charge a lot, they are RIP OFF  AND FOOD TASTED BAD TASTELESS full of oil !!! uuuuuggggghhhhhhh bad experience sorry :("}
{"text":"Authentic pakistani cuisine!!! Loved the food... its going to be my one go to place when i miss my mum's food."}
{"text":"Let me say this restaurant was on \"Point\"....I found this \"alternative\" as another very popular Pakistani establishment on Gerard street was not the same. Plus Karahi Point was not too far away from our hotel. So let me start the official review by saying this is not you typical, clean, cool establishment but more of a hole in the wall with ok service and padded seats and no heat. That being said who cares about the above as the food was on POINT!!!!! The Karahi hands down is the star of the show as it's rightfully named, the grilled meats were great, flavorful and the nan complimented very well as it was chewy and crispy at the same time. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. If you go just makes sure the Karahi is on your order list and the chicken tikka as they stood out on top."}
{"text":"Karahi Point was packed when we arrived, close to 10:00pm on a Sunday. We discovered there was a special Ramadan buffet menu being offered from 12:00pm until 4:00am. Yes, 4:00am!

Although some of the choices looked interesting, the buffet was pretty much depleted so we opted for the regular menu. We ordered the Chicken Karahi (boneless dark meat), Lamb Biryani, and Seekh Kabab (beef).

The Chicken Karahi, served with freshly made naan, was outstanding, full of flavour! The other dishes were also very good and all the servings were generous. I would order any of these dishes again, especially the chicken.

If this place was closer to home (a lot closer), I would come back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken karahi and beef kababs. The nihari is pretty good too. For the amount of people who come in here, this place is pretty small. Their service is slow since there are only 3 people running around doing everything. But the karahi is amazing. And it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"The new location is way bigger than the original one. And that's the best thing about this place. Once we sat down, it took us 25 min to get hold of the server. Then after another 50 minutes, the food arrived. Not a huge order. 2 karahis, naan and tawwa keema. The tawwa keema was a complete flop. Keema was chunky and tasteless. No sign of smoke flavour. Karahi was good. But not the same taste as their original location. Something is different. However, it is still good. But it is not worth the wait. There were only 2 or 3 servers. It's 7-8 times bigger in size, but still the same number of people serve. But unfortunately it's not their fault. They can serve only what's cooked and provided. To wait almost an hour for 2 karahis is ridiculous. Won't be coming back. Either I'm going to old location or finding another place for my karahi fix."}
{"text":"Legit karhai y'all (meat based dishes from the western parts of pakistan/Afghanistan made and served piping hot in woks). We drive an hour to eat here.. its that good. Chicken White karhai is flavorful but not spicy so great hit with the kids and white people. Mutton karhai (lamb meat) & chicken were delicious. Don't let the greasy shady looking unkempt exterior put you off. This is the real deal. Bring wet wipes and DIG IN WITH YOUR HANDS AND THE NAN. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The Karahi is really really really good! And the service is nice too...
You do have to wait for it for a while but it's worth is because they make it fresh from scratch"}
{"text":"Karahi Point is well on point with what's good and what's authentically Pakistani and damn tasty for all us hungry seekers of heavy sauce on protein. 

Well that escalated quickly, a trip to perfectly shaped eyebrows at the nearby threading place and we ended up having mouthful orgasms of some good karahi at this joint. We walked in not knowing what to order, while we browsed through google photos and read reviews on here on how amazing everything tasted.

We were lucky to have met the lady who worked at the cashier, as our waitress and occasional cook who worked closely with her husband (la chef) as they concocted delicious entrees from their beloved mother land. 

She explained with the least bit interest at first on what their restaurant's specials were, probably because she thought the hubby and I were new to the spice trail of this wonderful cuisine. Little did she know, we were ready to try anything once on her extensive menu. After we professed our love for anything saucy and spicy, she was hyped or so I choose to believe as she recommended going for the dark meat karahi as it holds most flavour compared to chicken breast version.

It came flaming hot on this black frying pan and served with some of my favourite green chilis topped on the dish and when all those flavours combined with a push of their freshly baked naan, I could divorce all other cuisines at that very moment. 

The masala fries were a good appetizer because salads are inappropriate when trying to karahi the right way.
I mean I love me some butter chicken but the sauce makes this dish second to none at that very moment when you've got a mouthful of naan, chicken, yogurt and that good karahi sauce!!!!!!

Restaurant quickly filled up after lunch on a weekend and we were glad for the hour we had the restaurant to ourselves and felt like VIPs as we munched away with zero looky-lookers as we displayed karahi drenched beards."}
{"text":"Best nihari and karhai in Toronto. They have a new location on Finch, which is way better to accommodate bigger parties and families"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pakistani food in Toronto. 

So glad they've expanded to this newer, bigger location. Best nihari, karhai, bbq - the naan is great too. Service is always super friendly... They do take time to get dishes out, but that's what ensures fresh food everytime. Also, they always let you know you may have to wait, so it isn't like you're blindly waiting. I think the wait is so worth it."}
{"text":"Ohh my where to start from food we ate OR service we got just amazing never been to any Indian/Pakistani restaurant like this before. They are doing great job serving fresh food it's all legit Karahi how my mom and grandmas make highly recommend best food ever will be coming again and again."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best Pakistani food around. Clearly the staff have very little enthusiasm about working at this restaurant, since they refuse to treat their customers with respect. The food wasn't good either. The Chicken Pakora wasn't cooked well, and had very poor spices. The Karahi was bland as well, which was surprising for it being their signature dish. Their other location is better."}
{"text":"This was the best chicken karahi I had in a while. 
AlsoI tried there bihari Kabab it was not bad but could be better

There servers where very prompt"}
{"text":"Great chicken Karahi 
Quick service 
Served hot & fresh
It was worth going up there 

The beef seekh kabobs were also great.
Will go again"}
{"text":"A much better location for the place. I think this place used to be a Swiss Chalet. It is a nice family place now with ample space.
The house was full tonight. The food was good. The Bihari Chicken tikkah was the best item 
The kabob Karahi was good
And the chicken Karahi was great too.
Good service
Courteous, attentive and warm."}
