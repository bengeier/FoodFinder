{"text":"This is a great hidden gem in Cuddy

The atmosphere is fun and drinks are flowing. They have a great happy hour and offer specials 5-7. 

Everything that I've tried here has been great and they give you way too much. 

They offer specials every night but I can only remember taco Tuesdays and $2 burgers on Wednesdays"}
{"text":"This is such a great local hangout!  Although it is no longer Fergs, it has been changed to Iron Creek Bar and Grill.  The atmosphere is very welcoming and its a great place to grab drinks with friends or even bring your family.  The wings and french fries are out of this world!  I've had nothing but positive experiences every time I come here. The staff is always accommodating and they really go out of their way to make your experience enjoyable.  I highly recommend it!"}
