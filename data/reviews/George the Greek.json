{"text":"Went there for dinner with the family on Friday evening. Younger son called the exterior 'sketchy' but really was a sign and storefront about 25 (or longer) years old.  I like longevity in the restaurant world--means they are doing something right.   We sat down (not a lot of seating available) and were greeted in a few minutes.  The place was hopping with take out and eat in customers.
Food was excellent and well done. Fam had Gyro on pita dinners and Gyro salads save for my daughter who had the Manager's special breakfast (a huge plate of eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and pancake and french toast)--she gave it two thumbs up.  Started with feta, Saganaki (Opa!) and olives---all were excellent.  Not only was the food great but was the most reasonable pricing I've seen in a while.  Definitely will be back to Georges."}
{"text":"Excellent quality, portions, prices, diner ambiance & cooking skill. I originally only dined outside due to the loud traditional (irritating to me) Greek music, but I haven't heard it for a few months so I can now dine inside comfortably.  Fresh cut non-frozen fries and freshly grilled chicken souvlaki (not frozen/pre-cooked) exemplify the superb attention to detail. Unfortunately, the owners' teen daughter seems to think picking and pinching the pimples from her shoulders (as well as loudly & badly singing along to the radio) while sitting in the dining area is acceptable.  Likewise, the mother/aunt server is difficult to gain attention from sometimes."}
{"text":"Really good small Greek diner. Love the gyros, big portions, great prices and very friendly staff. It's a gem."}
{"text":"I don't go to George's for the Greek food. I usually order from the hot oven sandwich selection....it is SO good. The sandwich comes with fries. I can never finish my whole meal.  My partner usually orders the chicken parmesan....AMAZING. The bubbly cheese on top is so good. George's is more like a family diner. We go there often- definitely a favourite."}
{"text":"We live really close to George's and come here quite often for the gryros and fries with a pop for $7.50 Such a good value for the money. Also the greek salad is amazing. Honestly one of the best in the city. The cooks are always super friendly and so nice to my kids. Service can get slow when they have walkins and he phone orders coming in. But it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch last Saturday. My husband had ordered their food before and loved it. I ordered eggs Benedict and the eggs were very well done and the potatoes were greasy so I could not eat them. Service was great though."}
{"text":"I've reviewed this place for their amazing breakfast and brunch options before but tonight we popped in for a late dinner. As usual the service was gruff but in an endearing kind of way. I has the gyros dinner and my bf had the souvlaki. Considering we came in 40 minutes before closing time everything was really fresh. I loved the greek salad with real, not salty and processed, feta. Both our meals were quite generous and the gyros although a little salty, was moist, well seasoned and delicious. I'm so glad this little gem is in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place is great.  It's not fast, but the portions are enormous and the food is delicious.  I had the baked lasagna, which was closer to the way lasagnas are made in Quebec than Ontario (more cheese, green peppers, mushrooms).  It was amazing.   I'll be there often."}
{"text":"Best pork souvlaki I have ever had.  Had a few other meals here and quality was good as well as price."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this gem when I was grabbing a beverage from Starbucks as I was hungry and in need of lunch. The decor is close to a low joint diner and at times, can barely make out what the person/people behind the counter are saying.

Twice I've ordered their chicken souvlaki dinner and in a pita and each and every time, it was delicious, soft and fresh. I've read a few of the reviews now and yes - they do take a long time to prepare the food, so if you are in a rush, I'd suggest calling ahead of time and ordering as it does take them 15-20 minutes to prepare the meal (dine in and take out).

It's as good as most of the good restaurants on the Danforth, but situated in the Longbranch area.

Service is diner-style, so if you are waiting for great service - this is not the joint for you."}
{"text":"Amazing food, fantastic value, the friendliest service and owners, I freakin love this place... Will always come back when in the hood"}
{"text":"Tasty souvlaki, but I've had better.  Ordered take out over the phone, arrived when they said and they were quite busy so I knew I'd wait for a minute, but I wasn't even acknowledged!  I waited at the cash while a group that came in behind me sat down and was served first!  Then another table was leaving and was again served before me.  No one asked if they could help me and finally I interrupted one of the women to ask if a small chicken souvlaki dinner was ready, she says \"I think so\" and proceeds to grab the take out container I've been staring at for 10mins with the cold garlic toast on top.  Very unhappy, won't go back."}
{"text":"This place has extremely slow service.  Good was bland.  Don't waste your time here.  Horrible wait times"}
{"text":"Not a clean restaurant and the food is greasy. Way better Greek places all over etobicoke. Will not return."}
{"text":"I'm never one to say that the sides eclipse the main but at George the Greek in Longbranch this is the case. That's not to say that the main course is bad at all, it's actually amazing but between the potatoes, rice and greek salad (lettuce style not traditional) I was totally floored!

I'd eaten here once or twice already as they do a great cheap Gyro sandwich which is packed with meat and toppings for $6 each. The meat is freshly shaved to order, not pre shaved like many places and kept in a warming tray. Fresh shaved and the cooked on the flattop! 

Last night we stopped in for dinner and they were BUSY, not just the seating but the take-away orders were flying off the counter fast and furious. People were coming in for everything from Souvlaki dinners to sandwiches to burgers to salads and more and more.

We took up a table and ordered a (large - two skewer) lamb souvlaki dinner and a vegetable souvlaki dinner. The dinners come with the aforementioned salad, potatoes and rice. The salad comes dressed perfectly and topped with a mountain of moist feta, while the potatoes and rice are tender and covered in a deliciously light sauce. Usually this ruins a Greek meal for me because the potatoes and rice are dry, not at George!

The Lamb souvlaki was pretty good, cooked to liking (medium rare), the taste was good and the meat was well cooked and well seasoned. It was a little chewy and tough in some spots so not the best I've ever had but still pretty good. Arguably better than some of the touristy crap I ate while in Greece last year.

Dinner was also incredibly cheap, including two drinks it came out to less and $45 tax and tips in - at that price, why am I cooking at home?

{"text":"Visited this place more than 5 times already and very happy with its food and service. Chicken/ beef souvlaki dinner,  chicken wings, stakes - everything is very tasty and portions are huge for that comparatively small price. At my first visit the owner presented the pen with the name of the place as a small souvenir."}
{"text":"So we have made this a regular place to eat when I don't feel like cooking. It is an excellent value for money. Our daughter and George are best of friends. Tina his wife is lovely. We've even managed to get George's brother to smile here and there.
The food: the lamb, beef, and pork souvlaki is excellent. The salads are fantastic. I have had the gyros with salad and it was awesome. The portions are still huge. Their menu selection is extensive. We still have many things to try and I would encourage anyone to come and enjoy a meal here."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from George there Greek.

All in all the food was bland. It was cooked well, but under seasoned. 

We had:
Hummus - we liked this!
Tsatsiki - a bit on the runny side
Salad - dressing was too oily
Chicken Souvlaki dinner - bland chicken and potatoes"}
{"text":"Found this small \"hole-in-the-wall\" diner on Yelp when I was in the area and am so glad I did!  I probably never would have gone in based on the external appearance of the place, but in this case looks are deceiving.

I called ahead and ordered for takeout - chicken slouvaki on pita with Greek salad.  Portions were large and most importantly the food was fresh, delicious and very well cooked (chicken was moist and juicy - just perfect).  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A very, very solid 4 out of 5.

This place needs to be judged for what it is - a family run joint with homemade recipes. There are a few tables scattered inside, and it's a bit crowded. It's very simple & dated decor, but that doesn't change the taste of the food (which is what you should aim for at a restaurant).

We started with the Spanakopita appetizer, which was a delicious portion featuring cheese & fresh spinach. We also ordered a large beef souvlaki plate, which came with 2 skewers of beef cooked to temperature, a hefty portion of rice, and a baked potato in quarters, drenched in butter of course. I chose the gyro with fries dinner ($8.75) which had a pita underneath. It was simply delicious. The meat was seasoned well and super tender. I ended up getting a side of Tzatziki for my fries.

Dinner came to $35 with taxes. The portions were large and the service was friendly, albeit a little slow. We didn't mind waiting."}
{"text":"Delivery took an hour. Everything was moist and appeared perfectly cooked but from Greek salad dressing to gyro everything was bland. Dressing for salad was basically just oil. The gyro was tender but lacked flavour. Although it was all very reasonably priced especially considering how much food they give you I likely won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Always treated like family. Decent portions to large size and both tasty and filling. Excellent value for the dinners."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ate there when we moved to the area , the food was great the first time. we ordered pork and chicken soulvaki and onion rings, but the second time it was terrible. old oil on onion rings smelled bad, the salad was cheaply made with a sprinkle of greek club house herbs , the grease basin on the side of his business turns away the appetite as it stinks on hot days! over priced and food handling needs to prep up, we will not eat there again, There is better Greek food elsewhere! Sorry George!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for greek food and there really isn't to much choice in, or even near the area. Etobicoke, east and west has virtually nothing.
Found these guys online, friendly service, I was greeted almost as if I was a regular patron. Waited about 15-20minutes for our food but worth it. 
I would go as far as saying it's the best Greek place in town, but it's definitely on the radar. 
More than adequate portions, tasty souvlaki, Greek salad with feta and dinners come with rice and.or potatoes.
I'd recommend this place if you're in the area and will probably be back. Friendly, greasy, corner restaurant. Those always have the best food."}
{"text":"Forget Zet's !!! George's chicken souvlaki slays Zet's dry and boring souvlaki. George's souvlaki was juicy and tender perfectly seasoned with amazing rice and potatoes, a huge second plate of tasty Greek salad  (not just a dollop of salad on the side of the potatoes like most other places. ) we also ordered the Skordalia essentially Greek garlic mashed potatoes served with pita. SO GOOD. Will probably order that every time! We also ordered a side of dolmadakia (stuffed grapevine leaves ) they were incredible!! Seriously I've been to Greece 3 times and loved the food. Easily the best Greek food I've had anywhere in Canada is from George's! Sure Messina is okay.... But this is so fresh and real. You feel like home cooking? Eat here. There's a reason this place was packed on a Monday night at 8:30!"}
{"text":"DECENT Greek food, not great. 
I liked the staff, helpful and quick. 
Interior is old, needs a revamp. 
$12 for small chicken dinner is pricey."}
{"text":"Great typical little greek diner ...
Reminds me of my highschool days they probably have one of the best Gyros in the west end of the city that's forsure .....Great burgers and fries ..oh those old school fries and gravy ...what memories ..if you want some old school nostalgic memories try the fries and gravy ..I'm sure it'll bring back some great times in your life ..sometimes foods like that are fun ."}
{"text":"Amazing gyros - jam packed with meat. I loved it. Ordered the gyro with greek salad. The salad was good too except I should personally say \"light on the onions\" next time. If you're a fan of onions, you'll be fine. I also ordered a large caesar salad for my daughter who doesn't like much. She commented on how good the caesar dressing was. Good price - my family of 4 ate for $32. As a take out meal it held up well for the drive home and waiting for hubby to arrive from work. Delicious."}
{"text":"Finally tried George The Greek for the first time! Rushed by a thousand times dragging my tired kids home from school, but today was finally the day to stop and get some delicious Greek food!  

My husband ordered their Chicken Souvlaki Dinner, which he shared with our 10 year-old and I ordered the Veggie Souvlaki Dinner, both came with a gigantic Greek salad. 
The portions are absolutely enormous, you will not leave this restaurant feeling hungry, prepare to bring home leftovers.

Chicken was tender and flavourful, rice and potatoes just melt in your mouth, according to my husband and kid, both loved every bite and were happy with the generous portions.  
My veggie souvlaki was really surprising, I never expected the veggies to be presented so beautifully and be this flavourful, I also didn't expect this restaurant to have any veggie options at all, but they have a few good ones! 

We also ordered Greek coffee, which was fragrant and pretty potent, I highly recommend it.  
Tina, our waitress is a very sweet person and so is George, we'll definitely be back to get to know the rest of the staff, this restaurant has a home-like atmosphere with lots of regulars and a lot of interesting neighbourly conversations. 
My 10 year-old left the restaurant with a pocket-full of candy, thanks to Tina :)

{"text":"So we went to this place because a friend recommended it to us.It is a hole in the wall dive that just happens to be delicious.  They have been in business over 50 years, and you can tell why as soon as you see the food much less taste it.  Super friendly customer service experience too....they do not hesitate to show you how you can save money when ordering your food.  We ordered to large chicken souvlaki dinners which each comes with a large Greek salad , potatoes, tatziki, rice, and chicken, along with a side of garlic break and pitas............way more food than 2 people can eat.  We got the food to go and once we got it home opened it up....beautiful.  You can tell they love food by the presentation and taste.  I definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"Solid Greek food.  Fairly pricey but it's the only Greek game around. 
Biggest pain is they are just the wrong size.  Too small for all the tables in there."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was friendly!

Restaurant is divey original '70s.  Apparently, they are going to be doing renos soon.

Cooking is more home-style.  We ordered the hummus which was just made in-house and it tasted like it!  Quite garlicky.  Rice is as per pic, more wet, drenched with the sauce from the potatoes.  I had them as leftovers today and it was a bit salty.

All meats were cooked well, tender, not overcooked or hard at all.  Servings are quite generous.

Woman who served us was really friendly and I think that stands out above the food."}
{"text":"The customer service was alright, nothing really to complain about.. but they aren't really attentive.. small and outdated restaurant but the food was fresh and tasted good. The potatoes and rice ans salad was really good and the chicken was very good too.. some would say it is bland, but I found the chicken souvlaki fairly seasoned well and not over the top. I sprinkles only just a bit of salt over it, although there was no need, really. I'd come here again and I recommend. The cook asked me if the food tasted good, I said yes, lolll"}
{"text":"The food here is great and the staff is very friendly. Nothing fancy just good food. The cook takes pride in every dish he makes. Gyros and eggs is my new favourite breakfast dish!"}
