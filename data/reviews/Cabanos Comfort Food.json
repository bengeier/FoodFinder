{"text":"Outstanding food. Great Atmosphere, highly recommended. The Cabano burger is out of this world but everything on the menu is great."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious! Cabano's burger is by far the best burger I've had. The veal is delicious. I haven't had something I didn't like. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"This place (formerly Johnny's) is a bastion in an otherwise barren gourmet landscape. I couldn't be happier that this place is under new management, these boys know their shit! The paninis are off the chart delicious. It's the little things like toasting the bun on the grill and properly seasoning the rapini that make the difference. You can get a veal sandwich anywhere but these guys make it with love. The chicken is great, so is the steak. The sautéed onions and provolone are a must for toppings. They also have mushrooms, sweet peppers and the afore mentioned rapini. A proper Italian sandwich - fogetaboutit!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! Very clean and friendly! A must try! Wish there was a location by me!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! The food here is amazing. When I came here with my coworker, he decided to order us two double cheeseburgers, chili cheese fries AND a Philly cheese steak sandwich. It was coma-inducing goodness.   The burger patties tasted so fresh and juicy, and the Cabanos sauce is awesome. The chili cheese fries were covered in tons of ground beef and cheese and still managed to stay pretty crispy. I could only muster a few bites of the Philly cheese steak at that point, but it was also really good and well-made.   Will definitely come back and bring more to help me eat through everything!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for lunch in Vaughan! The sandwiches are always freshly made and super flavourful. My husband and I look forward to the specials every time we go (which is usually once a week). The Cabano burger is the best we've had in a long time, even better than Burger's Priest. Be sure to order the burnt chile sauce on the side - you'll want to put it on everything! Staff is very friendly and the place is spotless. Can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"How do I put this. I had written the wrong review under Johnny Panini and not this place. The first time I went, there was no sign, so I assumed it was Johnny Panini.   Here is my first/initial review, and do note that things have improved over since. I've been to this place three times now and enjoy the food.   Working around the area, there are many choices to dine in for lunch, and Cabanos is one of them. My coworkers and I usually go out for either Pizza, Chinese, or the traditional Tim Hortons, Wendys, etc.  However, I finally took decision that we should try out Cabano for lunch.  (UPDATE: Renovation is complete) Just a heads up, that I think because of renovation, they have taken down their display sign, so spotting the place could be difficult. However, if you can smell the tasty dishes coming from the area, then you know you are in the right place.  We went in around 12:45PM and placed our orders. My coworker ordered a chicken panini, and I myself ordered a chicken panini with medium spice, along with mushrooms and sweet peppers. We placed the order to go, provided our names and sat down waiting for it.  Do note that it is a busy place, so do expect the wait. We ended up waiting for around 20 minutes, and our names were called. The front cashier apologized for the delay, and my coworker and I hoped that it was well worth the wait. After opening up the wrapping, the size of the kaiser bun I think was perfect, and it smelt great. The chicken was cooked/grilled perfectly, and I think the chicken was lightly dusted in bread crumbs to make it crispy so to speak. The spice was perfect along with their sauce, and the toppings were perfect. I can definitely attest to the excellent quality and it was well worth the wait. It was pretty filling too.  However, as with any place I review, there's always either a star or more docked off. In this case, they lost a star because of the following:  1) The service could be slightly \"quicker\", and not having their customers to wait. There was one customer who ordered after us, and had received their order before mine.  2) I am not sure if they are renovating the place or not, but the smell of the grill was too off putting. At one point, my coworker and I could not breathe and take in the smell. As a result of that, our clothes are lingering with the charred/grill smell, and even on our hair. Perhaps they could have a proper ventilation system. There was even a light trace of the smoke that comes from the grill inside the dining area.  3) There could be another vegetarian option? They do have the eggplant parm sandwich, but having one with vegetables would be great. This is something that I like another place in Mississauga called On a Bun. I am sure they will eventually have more vegetarian options.  Overall it was definitely worth it, but if they can improve on the above three, then definitely they are worth the 5 stars. I look forward to trying out their pasta dishes.  2nd review:  Service has gotten better, and I had tried their eggplant sandwich. It is delicious. Definitely worth checking it out!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times but never have I been disappointed. The Cabano's burger is outstanding! But even more delicious are the veal sandwiches. A must visit if you find yourself in the area.   The owner is polite, friendly and takes pride in his work. Well done guys. Keep up the tasty meals!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place. Wow I'm floored. Keep up the great work. Try this place u will not be dissapoint"}
{"text":"The sandwich was awesome, we had steak sandwich with medium spice. It was a bit too hot for me, but it was fine for my friend. They gave us a lot of fries lol! It was an awesome experience! The cental heating system was broken so the guy put a heater beside us to keep us warm?I seriously like this place, thumbs up! XD"}
{"text":"How is it possible that the best burger, veal, steak, and chicken sandwich I've ever had are all in this one relatively unknown place. Try it before the lineups get to be too long once folks finally figure it out."}
{"text":"Been there twice. First time got the steak, was seasoned excellent, very flavorful. Second time for the cabano burger. Flavorful burger, all that was put on it was lettuce and cheese, I was lied to as I was told the burger came with onions and fried jalapeño aswell. Was not present when I opened my burger at home. I will reiterate that the meat was soft and flavorful. However, Toppings could improve and apparently so could their honesty/consistency.  Steak is 7.5/10 Burger 6/10 ( 5 guys is better and has more options)"}
{"text":"Amazing first visit to Cabanos Comfort Food - a must visit!  had the signature hamburger and can easily say it is likely the best burger I've ever had.  #NailedAClassic   A nice touch by the owner to come out and make sure the meal was good part way through and doubled checked at the end.    This place is worth traveling to just to experience!     Check it out, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Good job Yelp   Came here on an email from Yelp promoting this business.  Reviewed the email two days ago and drove here from Markham.  THIS RESTAURANT IS OUT OF BUSINESS.  NICE JOB YELP, possibly before you promote a business ensure they are still in existence before you email out to yelpers."}
{"text":"unfortunately they closed on 31st Jan 2017 :-(  best beef patty burger and best Philly cheese stake sandwich ever"}
{"text":"My only wish is that it stays this good for as long as possible. The Cabano Burger is something special; I really do think it's better than Burgers' Priest.  Philly cheese is fantastic as well. Very good fries, and if you can handle spicy, ask for burnt chilly sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Tried both the veal and steak sandwiches so far, and the steak was much better than the veal... They have this tomato pepper sauce/paste they spread on the sandwiches and the \"spicy\" version was actually SUPER hot lol. I didn't expect it to have so much kick, but a great place to get some sandwiches nonetheless. They definitely dont skimp out on the amount of meat piled on the sandwich, so its worth the price. Looking forward to trying a burger there!"}
