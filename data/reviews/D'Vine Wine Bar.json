{"text":"so, i've had some more food here and it has not all lived up to the \"phenomenal\" description i used last time.  (sadly the mac and cheese is now served in a big bowl, sans crispy top.)  but i still love the place.  here's why:  1. it is fabulous in summer.  the patio is a see and be seen site for downtown workers and dwellers.  particularly at happy hour. 2. men in suits indeed. 3. it is fabulous in winter.  we went out last weekend and the warehouse looked dead.  but everyone was in d'vine, the place was hopping.  and def a classier crowd than some of the rest of the neighborhood. 4. i had my first wine flight here and the server didn't make me feel ignorant.  and it made for a fun giggly ladies night. 5. the food options are good sizes and prices for sharing or snacking, rather than having to commit to a whole meal. 6. the service still rocks.  it was packed last weekend and we were still doted on, by multiple personnel.  also, i had a gift certificate, and somehow it disappeared mid-meal.  the server remembered having seen it on the table, and gave us the discount anyway.  very sweet."}
{"text":"Wow, what happened to this place?  A once iconic downtown bar has turned into a hole in the wall!  I went in around 8 on a Friday night only to find the place completely empty.  I asked for a Bud light and was told they don't have any domestic beer because they forgot to go to the store!  What kind of a place forgets to go to the store? Thank god they had Great Lakes!  I was hungry so I ordered a burger, hoping since there was no one else in the bar, it would be fast and good.  After 20 minutes or so, the burger came out and it was RAW!  you could tell it was a frozen patty.  I told the bartender who graciously took it back.  He was nice enough to give me a free beer while I wait.  So I sat there for another 20 or so minutes waiting on the re-fire.  By now, I am no longer hungry and tell the bartender to forget the burger.  He walks into the kitchen to tell the cook and just then the burger comes out.  He says to the cook and I guess the owner, that I no longer want the burger.  At this time, the \"owner\" yells at me to get out!  What are you serious?  The burger was raw and took almost an hour to cook!  Remember, I was the only one who ordered food!  I left and will never go back.  It is a shame because this place was a nice place to go but not any more.  Later I saw the bartender outside and he said he was sorry for what happened.  I feel sorry for him because he isn't going to make any money at a place like that.  I bet that place closes in 6 months or less.  Such a shame."}
{"text":"So I'm not in the business of doling out 5-star reviews, but...  I spent 3 years (2006-2008) living in Cleveland, I ate and drank 2-4 times a week at D'Vine Wine Bar.  The bartenders and servers were super personable and I always felt at home there.  Last thing, but maybe the most important is the food, IT IS AMAZING! Seriously amazing, they change the menu up occasionally but always make sure to keep the perennial favorites on there.  They had a Duck Confit pizza that was out of this world (I'd call it more of a flatbread but who cares).  Prices are fine, service is good and wine list is quite well rounded.  Finally, just to illustrate the at-home feeling I always got when I was there, they picked up and stocked Ginger Beer and a Dark Rum (that they even wrote my name on) so I could drink Dark and Stormy's there!  Love 'em!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The mushroom pizza is perfect with large portobellos and truffle salt. During the summer they have a delicious ceviche they make fresh in-house. Servers are very friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable.  Great date spot and happy hour is very good too."}
{"text":"I have to rate this based on what it is, and as a wine bar with tapas, it was ok.  Mu husband and I were meeting up with a group for dinner and they chose this place.  Thinking we were going to a late dinner, I hadn't eaten since brunch.  I didn't do my research to discover they had tapas and small plates, not full-fledged meals.  But they weren't really small plate price.  I got a pizza for $12 with peaches, prosciutto, goat cheese, and honey.  It was DELICIOUS, but I was left wanting...more toppings on the pizza (it looked bare), and more food in general.  It would have been a great size for lunch, but as a dinner meal, it wasn't quite what I was hoping for.  And the prices were not low enough to make me feel good about ordering more than one plate...which is usually the allure of small plates/tapas.  The wine flights we had were decent, though probably a bit overpriced.  One of the rieslings from the flight my husband had is $9.99/bottle at the grocery store, but they were charging $7 for a glass and $26 for a bottle.  My husband enjoyed the pulled pork sliders he ordered for $10.  There were 3 sliders and a pile of chips, so he wasn't left quite as hungry as I was, which was good.  The atmosphere is pretty nice, but the service was darn near beyond slow.  There were only a handful of people in the place and what seemed like quite a few servers, so I'm not sure why everything took so long.  We joked that there had to be someone in the back stomping grapes for our wine.  A couple friends who arrived after some of us had already eaten, ordered food, and then were about to leave and go to a fast-food joint to hold themselves over til D'Vine served them their food.  Luckily it was good because the female half of that couple is pregnant and she was getting cranky, haha.  I wouldn't be opposed to going back.  At least I'd know what I was getting myself into.  I won't come starving, that's for sure.  But for quiet, relaxed conversation over good snacks, I'd return.  I should also note, that though the service wasn't the quickest, everyone that worked there was very nice, and for me at least, pleasant, slow servers are better than nasty, fast ones."}
{"text":"This is based on just one visit, so take it all with a grain of salt. Atmosphere's a little cold... with just a little work this place could go from being a little too dingy for it's own good -- after all, it's a wine bar, and it seems to want to be a classier alternative to the W. 6th doucheathon -- to a warm, inviting, versatile, and cozy hangout/dinner spot.  Biggest plus: I got a flight of four wines -- very generous pours -- for $15. The wine was great, but what do you expect. Anyway, you could do a lot worse.  Service was prompt, but that's about all I'll say for it.  Wasn't that hungry but had the beet salad. Not bad, but maybe the wrong choice? Too much dressing, should've gotten it on the side.  Hope to give it another try."}
{"text":"We enjoyed choosing from a big selection of wine flights, reasonably-priced.  Also enjoyable was the mushroom pizza and the BBQ Pork Sliders.  D'Vine has a great vibe, too - brick walls, great outdoor seating, etc. - so it was, all in all, a good visit."}
{"text":"We stopped in after doing a downtown pub crawl, staff was nice, drinks were great, food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Was here for a happy hour event last week.  The staff were helpful and friendly.  Our event included some appetizers (a couple kinds of pizza and bruschetta), which were pretty good too.  The bartender was happy to create some kind of pretty non-alcoholic juice cocktail for me."}
{"text":"Wine was excellent. Service was horrible. The waitresses were extremely friendly, just really slow. For some reason we had 2 different waitresses one was the bartender and we waited so long to order. 20min to order a drink, another 25 to order food. Baked brie was amazing! I ordered warm olives. Horrible. It was like a can of black olives with 1/2cup of oil over them and 2 crumbles of feta. My date ordered steak. Not only was his steak cold but it was half cooked. Half was cooked to what he ordered, the other half completely raw. He left half the steak all bloody on his plate and after 50min the waitress took his plate and never said anything about the raw meat that was left on the plate. We left hungry and just wanted the bill to leave and had to wait another 35minutes."}
{"text":"We went in as a group of 15 on a weekday for a work event. The host graciously accommodated us sans a reservation. The wine flights were good and very reasonably priced. The pizzas were delicious. The empanadas was great. And my lobster grilled cheese was phenomenal especially for $11  Will definitely go back the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is a nice retreat from the drunken crazies on the rest of the street. Personally, if I wanted to just go to a wine bar and not bar hop, I would pick a different wine bar, perhaps Market Ave or Wine Bar Rocky River, or something in Willoughby if I lived over that way. BUT, if you want to go downtown and start off mellow, D'vine is a nice option.   Also, it is a nice place to flirt over happy hours. Men in suits."}
{"text":"It's a big place with significant indoor and some outdoor seating.  The food is good - and happy hour prices such as $6 for a pizza are hard to beat - so D'Vine Wine Bar is someplace I plan to return.  I wish the \"small plates\" were actually small plates so I might be able to get 2 different things and make a dinner out of it but at $10-16 per plate it's clear these are designed to share rather than allowing an individual to eat more than one.  I would spend more money if the menu was better designed for a wine bar but that's more of a loss on the business' part.  The wine list by the glass is huge  - probably about 40-50 choices - and includes many different \"flight\" options, although there's honestly nothing too spectacular on the list and virtually all the glass pours would retail for only about $10-15 per bottle at your local wine shop.  That being said, these mass produced wines are fairly well chosen and while I would prefer to have more exciting stuff to try I do have to say that there are enough choices to make it through a night unless you're a true wine snob.  Unfortunately the stemware is pretty average - big, thick bowls that are likely just about indestructable but are not exactly a Riedel experience.  However, the service is friendly, the food is good, and the wine is decent so D'Vine Wine Bar gets bumped up to 4 stars and I'll likely be back.  P.S.  For the connoisseur I would suggest the best glass pours I have found in Cleveland appear to be at Lola and Parallax.  And Parallax has great happy hour prices too including $5 wine by the glass."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place.  Let's start with the pros:  Great wine selection and great food selection and a nice patio to sit outside.  And now onto the big con:  The service.  Oh, THE SERVICE SUCKS.  I've been to this place 3 times and each time the service has been horrible (and that's with 3 different servers).  One night we waited 45 minutes to receive our cheese plate.  We finally asked the server WTF happened and she looked like a deer in headlights.  Then we got the schpiel that the kitchen lost the ticket.  Well, blah blah blah.  It's not that f'n hard, people!  And the following 2 times I was there we got excuses like the bar forgot to make our drinks (we only ordered wine so I'm not sure what they had to \"make\") and then one of the servers forgot to put our order in.  Skip this joint."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at D'Vine, so this review is just about their wine - specifically their flights!  Oh jeez, their flights. This is probably the best value for wine downtown. They currently have 16 4-wine flights to choose from, all between $15-$18. These aren't little sips of wine - these are half-filled (or more) glasses. I have never left here without a significant (or very significant) buzz.  When it's warm enough, I love that they have outdoor seating. I've never had any issues with the service here, and would gladly come back for (yet another) flight of wine!"}
{"text":"In college, my friends and I used to go here to study.  No joke.  We'd order a flight of wine and the baked brie, sit back and read our text books.  I was mostly in it for the brie.  This is no ordinary brie.  . It's baked in a pastry, drizzled with brandy brown sugar glaze and served with fresh fruit.  A perfect match for chardonnay.  And economics."}
{"text":"Service is awesome...staff is very helpful. They have changed the menu since I had last been in there and got rid of less popular wines. Very thankful they kept mine!!! The staff remember you if you frequent the place so I didn't have an issue with when I said I want wine number 12 from the old menu if you still have it and if not something just like it please :-). They laughed because when I come in I just say #12 and my pizza (which is the sarano ham and artichoke...yummy)!!!! I love this place and always try and bring all my friends there. Also don't worry guys if you don't like wine they have some beers as well :-)"}
{"text":"On a snowy Friday night, my friends and I were surprised to walk in to a nearly empty wine bar.  There was one other table of people who were finishing up, but we didn't mind having the place to ourselves.  That meant that we got the full attention of the waiter who was very knowledgeable and willing to answer any silly question we could ask.    There is a HUGE selection of wines and I really enjoyed the variety of flights that they had.  I chose the sweet wines flight (#14) and loved all 4 of the selections.  I like how they each come with a description of the notes and undertones in each glass... Very descriptive and fun to learn! They also have beers and cocktails which some of the girls who don't care for wine took advantage of.    We had already eaten dinner so we didn't try any of the food on the menu, but I would like to in the future!  This is a quaint little place that I will be visiting again"}
{"text":"Went here after dinner and had a few drinks. Since it was a wine bar, I thought I'd try some dessert wines. I tried the one with blueberry and pomegranate. It wasn't what I expected. It was warm and dark. So I ordered something else, tried their rose one. I asked to make sure that it was chilled. Another disappointment. It was hardly chilled. The waitress was a friend of ours so I didn't want to give her a bad name so I just ordered my regular Hoegarden. It was decently priced for $5.   We didn't stay very long so it was an okay place. Nice to bring a group of friends just to hang out. Nice decor and plenty of space. If their dessert wines were a bit better, I'd give it another star."}
{"text":"LOVE coming here for work happy hours. One tip - don't try to order a mojito, they never have mint. Other than that, ah-mazing."}
{"text":"Great place. Went here for drinks after work during a weekday, for which it was a nice, quaint spot with great service. Had the crab and spinach pizza as well as the baked brie. Both plates were delicious and well proportioned. I felt that the pizza could have been more lightly salted and would have benefited from bringing out more of the crab flavor, but otherwise was a good accompaniment to the drinks. The baked brie was delicious and it was actually my first time seeing it on a menu. Would highly recommend it and would go back for this alone."}
{"text":"D'Vine is exactly the place to go when you just want a great experience that's still casual and not too pricy. The food has never let me down- the brie, lobster mac and cheese, and ugly tom are always delicious. They've got a great wine selection and the atmosphere is casual and yet classy. I've had a bunch of people visit me in Cleveland and D'Vine is always a safe place to take them that I know they will enjoy. I even enjoy going on weeknights after work and sitting at the bar- very comfortable place."}
{"text":"Not impressed, because those few time (3-4) that we have been here, we have been rushed and the service has been sub-par. Good wine? Yes, but that is to be expected in a WINE BAR - duh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"D'Vine Wine Bar has become a favorite of my friends when they visit Cleveland, so my life would be a lot harder if I didn't like it.  Luckily for me, I'm a fan!  But to be honest, I'm pretty much a sucker for any wine bar. I love wine. I love cheese. I love small plates. I love to nosh. Combine all those things together and they just scream \"get yourself to a wine bar, now!\"  So here's where I stand with D'Vine. I like it, but it's not my favorite. I love the location. It's off the W6th strip of debauchery on the semi-quiet street of St. Clair. But it's still close enough to see the real life soap opera of drunken people stumbling down the sidewalks from the bars, usually crying or screaming at someone. Talk about people watching! Just grab yourself a summer seat at D'Vine on their lovely patio and enjoy some vino! Unfortunately, they don't have popcorn to enjoy with the drama happening around you. I've asked.   In all seriousness, D'Vine has great deals on wine flights. Take advantage of those because you get a lot! They also have a great menu of small plates and appetizers. My favorites include the bruschetta and the best baked brie I've ever had. They serve it up wrapped in puff pastry drizzled with honey, crackers and seasonal fruit for dipping. Yum.   The staff is always super friendly and knowledgeable about the wines. That's a plus if you tend to be indecisive like me. The patio is small but really nice in the summer/spring months. Inside D'Vine is a different story. It's very dark, dingy and a little cold. They could do a little more to warm up the atmosphere, although it doesn't seem like they mind much. The crowd is also usually pleasant, more mature and lacking in the trash department. Although D'Vine does tend to attract bachelorette parites..."}
{"text":"This place is great. I have been twice now and get the same things... lobster mac & cheese and the baked brie soooo good!"}
{"text":"My office is within walking distance and this is a pretty nice outdoor area in the summer.  Granted it's facing a semi busy street, but still nice to sit, talk and have a drink.  Great wine selection and the prices arent that bad.  Very small and cozy inside"}
{"text":"hmmmm so where to begin.. I'm not exactly a huge wine connoisseur by any stretch.. so I may not be the best recommendation to read for this one.. but I really enjoyed my evening spent here!    I met a potential suitor for a few glasses of wine as well as dinner, wine was great... dinner not so much sadly. I had the lobster mac and cheese, which was ok.. but not stellear.  I was on a dry something new kick.. should've stuck with pizza because I've heard it's delish.   The place was dead on a Monday which is kinda sad.."}
{"text":"Cast aside any preconceived notions you have about wine bars. A snooty wine bar this is not. What it is though is a pleasant change in atmosphere from the rowdiness that is the rest of the bar scene down the street. It does get a little noisy during later hours, but overall the atmosphere remains laid back. If you do get the hankering for some West 6th entertainment, this is always a nice precursor if you simply want to relax before heading over, especially in the summer when you can grab a table outside and enjoy the cool evening weather.  I am not a wine drinker, and I will never understand \"tannins\" or the appeal of a $16 plate of cheese slices. Their beer selection is acceptable, and they have a decent cocktail menu, but that's not what I come here for. That would be an honor reserved for their baked brie. Nestled in a puff pastry glazed with a brandy-infused sugar syrup and accompanied by fresh fruits and crackers, this particular app has shot up my list of best foods I've ever eaten. It was so good the first time that we had to order another. I have not tried any other menu item, because when I get to the brie, I don't need to go any further. It's funny because it isn't something I would normally think of ordering. I've never even heard of it. I just happened to get a chance to taste it because someone in my group ordered it, and the rest, as they say, is history..."}
{"text":"D'Vine Wine Bar is my favorite spot in the Warehouse District, especially for happy hour.  I have never had a bad experience here.  The servers are always very helpful and always know the perfect wine or flight to suggest.  The cheeseboard, ohhh the cheeseboard.  I have dreams about it.  Varies by what's available but is always delicious.  Goat cheese stuffed cherry peppers, marinated olives, meat, delicious cheeses, roasted garlic, grapes. YUM.  While it's not a cheap place, it is definitely not as pricey as other wine bars, and offers quite the selection for any wine lover, whether you're a connoisseur or not.  The other food I've had has been great to sometimes a little mediocre.  The flatbreads/pizzas are pretty tasty.  Chocolate torte is a little uninspired and blah, but definitely fulfills that chocolate craving.  I almost always take any out of town guests here during their stay and everyone has loved it so far.  Oh, and in the summertime their patio is so welcoming, comfortable and nice.  On a cold snow day in winter, I definitely dream about the days sitting on their patio with a nice glass of wine and the cheeseboard."}
{"text":"I like D'Vine Wine Bar. I'm especially writing this review because I fell in absolute LOVE with their Tuna Nachos! Seared tuna on crispy chips with soy sauce, veggies and sour cream wasabi sauce. Very fresh....very yummy! Also...with all the wonderful wine there, it may be easy to miss some of their signature cocktails! THAT would be a mistake. I haven't had dinner here, and not sure this would top my list for that, but it's the perfect place to go for a drink and appetizers."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place. The service was absolutely horrible! The waitress gave me and my bf no service at all and when we complained we were met with hostility. This is the worse experience I've had at an local establishment by far. We'll never go back again."}
{"text":"Saturday night, but all I wanted to do was take a book and my laptop to a cafe for a few hours.  Asking a local for a recommendation, she suggested I skip the cafe and head to D'Vine, a downtown wine bar that has wifi and is often quiet on Saturdays.  I was skeptical, but checked it out and was duly impressed.  I was able to snag a leather recliner by the fireplace in a quiet room off to the side, and proceeded to have a fabulously productive study session with a tasty glass of wine recommended my my lovely server, Michelle.  I look forward to coming back to sample the food menu and one of their sixteen or so tasting flights..."}
{"text":"The location is great, but being a suburb girl I had no idea where to park for free. Paid parking? Oh hell no. It didn't help that everyone parked like an ass at the meters. Get your lives together, Clevelanders! But I digress. When I finally got to D'vine Wine, it was dead minus a small party in the back that disbanded quickly. I think practically the entire dining session, we were the only table. It was around 7:30 on a Wednesday... So a little strange but okay. They were out of practically every beer my companion wanted. Lame. However, when I couldn't decide between wines the server so kindly brought me some samples! Good service, and it was honestly helpful. I went with the Blue Bottle Riesling I believe it was called. I love wine :)   I was not a fan of the small sized appetizers. We ordered the mussels, and it was just like... 8 mussels max for $15 or something. What... Seriously, WHAT! I mean, they were good. I just can't really justify paying so much for them when 10 minutes away I can get a heaping plate of mussels in the Asia Town area for $5. Plus, they are as good if not better there!  So overall, I would go back if others really wanted to go. Like, for some strange reason it is the best place in the world for them and they won't hang out with me anywhere else. Other than that though, I see no point in going to D'vine Wine. They did not offer anything unique that makes me scream TAKE ME BACK!!"}
{"text":"So the evening I went to D'vine wine bar I:  -had a drink here that wasn't wine -went to a steakhouse later, and did not order anything steak-like  What can I say, I must have been feeling non-conformist that night.  Anyways, the D'vine in the city drink was wonderful (raspberry with some champagne), and I shared some chocolate pizza which was also quite tasty.  I'd definitely like to go here again to try a flight of wines."}
{"text":"It's kind of dusty like an old bottle of wine. just a bit of cheese.  D'vine, you leave me conflicted. Nice bartenders, interesting and way above average food.  The bartender actually asked for a temperature on sliders.  Sliders!  I asked for med-rare, and they actually came out that way! There is a very nice selection of cheeses, a great wine by the glass/flight program. That being said, there's this kind of unkempt grittiness to the place.  Dramatic chandeliers, with all different bulb wattages.   Sit at the bar, and it just looks disheveled.  An ATM is what greets you at the door.  A little spit and polish would bump this up to a 4 star.  I give 4 stars for the food, 4 stars for the wine list, 2 stars for atmosphere.  I should mention, the bartenders are exemplary as well, and a great patio in the summer to watch the human drama of the warehouse district.  And you do need alcohol for that.   3.5 out of 5 total.  Carry on."}
{"text":"Drinks are reasonable prices, stopped by because it was close to our hotel.  Nice place to start off the night if you are in a mellow mood.  We sat by the fire place and it feels like you are just hanging out at someone's place.  Very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"After seeing all the great ratings I was very disappointed. We ordered four appetizers. The calamari was hard and rubbery. The onion rings had no flavor. The tipsy shrimp tasted like it was dipped in Campbell's tomato sauce. The bruschetta was passable."}
{"text":"For this place to become a favorite for someone who does not like wine, it has to  make up for it in 2 ways: 1. Great food, 2. Great drinks.  I kind of wish they would shed the \"wine bar\" image and go with more of a \"food, wine, beer and spirits\" image because I think the are doing themselves a disservice (and keeping some people away) who think it may be a snooty wine bar.  I assure you - it is not.  We've been there through every season's menu and they are delicious. In the fall, the goat cheese salad is not to be missed.  Right now, the hanger steak and turkey chili are so yummy!  The seasonal creme brulee is always good!  And the non-wine drinks! Some of my favorite in town - delicious martinis with a hint of wine! And for the beer connoisseur husband to enjoy the place - well, I think it's easy to see why it's a favorite.  (They do host speed dating nights - and I would do my best to avoid it on those nights. Unless of course, you're one of the speed daters!)"}
{"text":"Always a fantastic time.  They menu has changed a bit, though.  No more happy hour, but the prices have lowered overall.  We tried a few different things and had several different wines. G Staff was accomidating and knowledgeable about the menu.  We went with the garlic shrimp, which was perfect with the toasted bread, and a cheese plate.  Overall, a great time with the ladies!"}
{"text":"My lovely wife and I stopped in here for wine and apps before a dinner reservation.  The place was sparsely populated, but I'd been here before, so I wasn't concerned.  We were seated at an outside table, which was fine because the weather was perfect.  We enjoyed a bottle of Mendoza Malbec, one of our favorite varietals, and the charcuterie platter.  Both were wonderful.  We were served by the owner, who was charming and attentive.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"As my best friend's maid of honor, we feted her in Cleveland. D'Vine Wine Bar served as our first stop and location for dinner. D'Vine kindly adjusted our reservation as the party train was a little late getting into the city.   At first, our group of six was a little overwhelmed by the wine and food menu. With the help of our cute server, we managed to pick out some rieslings and a pinot noir. The bachelorette and the others picked out a wide selection of tapas. The large number of tapas were served in plate caddies similar to a tea caddy. It was one of those cute touches to remember about D'Vine. My best friend the bachelorette craved the chicken lollipops while others choose the black bean ravioli, quesadillas, white pizza with shrimp, roasted mushrooms with goat cheese, and my personal choice of baked brie. The food is unbelievably amazing. Everything was tasty and delicious. The black bean ravioli is just hands down awesome. The spicy chipotle sauce interplayed with the black beans wrapped in ravioli squares. The white pizza with shrimp was also so tasty. I liked the flatbread crust alot. I loved the roasted mushrooms with feta. The portobellos, shitakes, and creminis were caramelized and balanced with the salty goat cheese. Seriously, I want to make that at home, it was so good. I honestly want to make this as an appetizer for friends because it was that awesome. I didn't notice the chili oil, but wow, it's good. The baked brie was everything that I was salivating over for weeks as I prepared for the dinner. The oozing brie surrounded by fruit and served with crackers was great. My bachelorette partygoers loved the dinner and were so glad that they got a great wine and tapas experience."}
{"text":"My previous review was a 4 - and I still love the wine and tapas, but I just feel I need to dock this place down for service. I've been there twice after my first visit and both times the service has been HORRIBLE despite us being one of two or three tables. I had the same waitress both these times who flocked to the table with a bunch of guys and talked to them the entire time, not realizing that she needed to possibly pay attention to her other tables.   BUT, the drop in my rating like I said is because of service. I'll still be going back until the food quality changes."}
{"text":"They have a large wine list (as one would expect) and also a decent martini list.  The food is good, but the kitchen is slow.  But for a wine bar their wine glasses are the same for white vs red and have a very thick glass which is not conducive to wine tasting. And the wine is generally severed at too warm of a temperature. Both of these things sound nit picky and I wouldn't mind if they were another bar downtown, and did not call themselves a wine bar."}
