{"text":"Excellent quality @ top value. I don't really love flavored fries but everything is so freshly prepared I didn't mind."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of a place that should get a lot more traffic than it does in this food court. It's run by the same people at Ruby's on the other side of the food court, and they live up to Ruby's reputation of terrific quality.  I ordered the steak sandwich, with a side of fries. Good quality beef, which had the pepper-gravy with it, along with grilled veggies and onions. Nice attention to detail too - such as putting the bun on the grill first. The fries may have been those Costco Cavendish frozen fries. Still not too bad when considering the price however. It was also super nice that he gave me a side of hummus for the fries when I asked, and didn't even charge me for it.  Excellent sandwich, and unlikely to be surpassed in this or virtually any other food court at this price. Hidden gem for sure."}
{"text":"They have good food and provide a generous portion for the price. My favourites are fajita and the steak sandwiches. Fries are awesome too. They used to have an amazing orabge lemonade, I miss it now."}
{"text":"Cheap good food. Had mixed chicken and beef with rice. Also ordered a shrimp sandwich and it came with fries so I was super full! Store is located inside the Eglinton Square food court next to McDonalds."}
