{"text":"Got delivery from Forest Hill Pizza, first time eating from here. Great pizza! Nice thin crust, generous toppings."}
{"text":"First off to the people that go on and on about \"Gourmet\" pizza blah-blah-blah, ITS BLOODY PIZZA PEOPLE.  Pizza is simple common food and that is when it is at its best.  And this it was not.  The four cheese pie was centimetres thick and had none of the oowie gooie deliciousness that is at the core of a good pizza.  When you pulled the slice from the pie you didn't get any of the beautiful strings of cheese.  It was anemic and for the price I honesty expect more then a hint that there is cheese somewhere on the pie.  Add to this wings that were supposed to be hot but were barely mild.  Have to say, No more for mio....."}
{"text":"Good customer service. Yummy pizza! Average priced. Average wait times at the restaurant. I don't recommend the wings - portions aren't great and \"suicide\" or \"hot\" wings aren't hot at all (or maybe I have a high tolerance?). Delivery is average - about an hour. It's close by and convenient. It also beats Pizza Pizza any day!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in the area. Tastes great and is the crispy thin crust style. Pick up deal is always good value. Not chain pizza, this is Italian style."}
{"text":"Came in here while waiting for an appointment. Signage outside is bright and appealing. Once inside it's a one-guy shop. Your common pizzas are available as slices with a much more extensive menu that includes meat, vegetarian and seafood options.

I had one of the slices and it's not greasy and has a slight crunch. It was just on the border of being too well-done for my liking. However, it was delicious and had a lot of toppings. 

Beside the cash they have a stack of printed sheets outlining the 4 or 5 ways that they are different. At brief glance, some of the points are certainly not unique to this place but i can't comment on some of the others (like unique recipe etc.)

Prices are reasonable, if not slightly cheaper than the competition. They have deals listed which would appear to make ordering a whole pizza worth your while.

All in all, if I'm in the area I'll come back but I probably won't go out of my way."}
