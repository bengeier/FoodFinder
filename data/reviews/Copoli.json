{"text":"Wish that we could give no stars for the ridiculous lack of service... but I suppose one star is for the lady who we dealt with... she was polite at least.

So here is what happened. We ATTEMPTED to order from this place in Februray. It is not more than a 10 minute drive away and we ordered on a Tuesday evening... so in theory they should not have been very busy. Was told to expect delivery in about a half an hour at most. 
After 45 minutes we called and asked if it would be long. \"On its way should be there any second...\" and was told our order left the restaurant about 20 minutes before. We confirmed the address and buzzer code. They had it right.

After another 15 minutes.. called back again. Was told that it should be there and was asked if we were sure we hadn't received it. (I think we would know if we had received it... we would have had food to eat instead of listening for the door buzzer over our increasingly loud growling tummies.) 

After another 20 minutes had passed we called back and said that we were no longer interested in eating what would be cold food.... mm mm cold and probably soggy french fries and cold burgers... yep... THAT sounds appetizing. The lady we were dealing with at first sounded surprised that we would cancel (I suppose that we were jumping the gun at an hour and twenty minutes ... I wonder what her cut off time is to cancel - two hours? 4.5 hours? A week?) and then she was appropriately apologetic and offered a 10 percent discount for the NEXT time we ordered...  Obviously we would be expected to pay in full for the meal that was still MIA when, or if, it ever showed up.

Really? A discount for the NEXT time? Like we were going to do this again? Not bloody likely. We told them that they needed to call the driver that we would not be accepting the food and we were cancelling our order and proceeded to called Nikas on Sherbrooke instead (who were here in 20 minutes with piping hot food). Skip Copoli... order from Nikas if you live in NDG area... their burgers are tasty and fresh... and you won't be staring out the window while your tummy growls in hunger waiting for food that is being given a scenic tour of the area."}
{"text":"I got the original hamburger and I'm not sure if it was really beef: maybe surprise meat?  It was gross, hard as a rock and could not finish it. I gave the delivery guy $4 dollars on a $20 total and he asked for more tip!  Unbelievable."}
{"text":"The burger was really good, I really liked the dressing but i think it was ketchup and mustard but with something else anyways the poutine would have probably been tastier if we ate it fresh since we ordered it, we pretty much got a warm poutine. I would probably eat from there again but unfortunately not any time soon!!!"}
{"text":"The worst pizza I've had in a long time. Worse than Delissio. I came here because I was starving and honestly, I should have just gone home. Had to wait for 25 minutes anyway.

Had a chance to see some of their other creations being made, and it's not pretty. This is one of those places that are rare in other large Canadian cities but still exist in Montreal, where the food is actually BAD. Like, below reasonable standards of quality. 

Conclusion: never again."}
{"text":"Nous étions des habitués chez Copoli, mais après avoir reçu des insultes par téléphone suite au suivi d'une commande pour livraison pour laquelle nous attendions depuis plus de 45min, une dame, qui se présente comme étant la propriétaire, à lever la voix pour expliquer qu'elle était en train de cuisiner celle-ci et nous demande si on désir toujours recevoir notre commande, le tout sans aucune excuse pour le délais d'attente. Choqué de son attitude, nous avons mentionné notre incertitude au sujet de la livraison et c'est alors qu'elle se mis a crier d'impatience en insultant son client de malade et d'aller \"se faire foutre\".. Ce sera fort probablement notre dernière \"tentative\" .. Il semble que la vente de ce resto, il y a deux ans et demi, mènera a sa fermeture si aucune amélioration au service a la clientèle n'y soit apporté dans les plus bref délais."}
{"text":"I would give this place negative stars but I'm not given that option. Actually, my preferred rating would be '1 Bulldozer', but that also is not an option, so here we go. 1 very undeserved star.

We were in town visiting a friend down the street and 4 of us stopped by here for lunch on the way to the Metro. There isn't much in the area, and this placed advertised a proprietary 'Copoli Burger' with some sort of optimism, so we thought we'd give it a try. After all, who can screw up a burger?

These guys. These guys can screw up a burger, and they can screw it up with painstaking efficiency and utter contempt. I asked about the 'Copoli sauce', which the server said was just a mixture of ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise or something like that. Since I'm a no-mayo kind of guy, I figured it wouldn't be too much to ask for just the standard ketchup/mustard on the burger. To the server it seemed like a standard no-hassle request. Awesome. I couldn't wait for this seemingly giant tasty-looking burger.

What I received was a large burger almost spitefully slathered with mayonnaise. For some context here, there was only one other table in the place, and they already had their food., so the margin for error or confusion here is very narrow. The other burger recipient at the table received their standard burger with just a standard amount of mayonnaise. So I flag the server, who was super nice during all of this, and show her the burger. Without even looking at it she said there was no mayo on it, but I didn't even have to lift up the bun to show her this 'mysterious' white ooze coming out of it. She offers to take it back and bring me a new one. This is where things get downright offensive.

Through the corner of my eye I can see the cook (who I am pretty sure is the owner, and the father of our server) take the burger back to the counter and throw the bun in the garbage. Where is the rest of the burger? I wonder. Surely that would go in the garbage too. Nope! There he is, scraping away the mayonnaise with none other than paper towel. He is clearly oblivious that with a small restaraunt, what he is doing is visible to all the customers. Maybe he does realize it, and just doesn't care. Either way, I am brought what I am expected to believe is a new burger, and again, I didn't even have to take the bun off to ask what all the white stuff was still all over the bacon. He must have missed that with the paper towel. 

At this point I refuse any further burgers and I can tell the server is pretty embarassed. The cook/owner/father at no point during all of this even attempts to make eye contact (we are like 10 feet away) or offers any glimpse of shame or even recognition of how messed up this is. I watch the rest of my friends finish eating their pepperoni pizza, which had been unexpectedly dusted in sesame seeds, and I left hungry.

I'm not one for gentrification, but if someone bulldozed this place and put up a condo, I wouldn't be sad."}
{"text":"Good food, nice people, decent prices. Everytime I've gone they always had English and French people as opposed to what another reviewer said."}
{"text":"Came here the other day after seeing those massive burgers on MTLBlog.

At first I was not too sure about this place as the seating/decor isn't the greatest, however, once I got to the counter  I knew I was in for a treat! The service was great, both the man and women behind the counter were super friendly and waited on us hand and foot! It was refreshing service for a hole in the wall burger joint! I was really pleased. 
 
I ordered the 8 inch cheeseburger with a fry on the side. The cheeseburger really does live up to its name! It is massive! The ingredients and bread seemed fresh. You can hear the staff making up the patties for the burgers in the back. What I liked most about the burger was that it almost had a unique taste. Whatever spices they are putting in there works! The sauce they put on almost seems like Big Mac sauce from McDonalds! The fries are golden and crispy. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this place and would come back again! If you are a burger lover, you have to try this place out for a different and interesting take on a burger. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The burgers are good but their delivery policy seems to change from day to day. After placing my usual order over the phone (two bacon cheeseburgers), they called me back to say that, in order for them to deliver to my neighbourhood, the order had to be $20 before tax (not the policy last time I got food delivered from them, but whatever). Fine, I'm $2.50 short. To meet the $20 minimum, I tell her to add a small order of fries (which I do not want, seeing as the burgers are already big and their fries are not the best, especially after they have been delivered). She then says I have to order two trios for $23.50 or they won't deliver. Uh, no. Get it together people. I ordered from Boustan instead."}
{"text":"I'm assuming something must have really changed in the past few years because I had a good meal!

Copoli is located right across Vendome Metro and conveniently close for many NDG/Westmount folk! The \"ambiance\" is kind of adorable. It's a no-frills diner with the griddle out in the open and tons of neon.  Definitely brings on the nostalgia!

Their burger is HUGE. The image on the menu is actually to scale! Of course,  its large diameter is mostly due to how flat the patty and buns are but you're still guaranteed to be filled up. The burgers were pretty good taste-wise, very classic. I got mine with a salad (lol) which was fresh and generous in quantity but the dressing was kind of tasteless. My date got his with fries which were perfectly thick and golden. 

As for the service, we have no complaints. Our orders arrived quickly and our waitress was very nice and polite. 

Overall we left satisfied. On a future night when we're feeling naughty and don't want to cook I can definitely see us coming back!

Fun fact: they also deliver!!"}
{"text":"So, I really wanted to like this place. Family run, in the neighbourhood, and the reviews were positive. 

Unfortunately, this was one of the worst experiences I have had in a restaurant. 

Where to begin:
1. It was raining and cold, yet they had both the garage door and front door open. It was freezing inside. Most people kept their coats on.
2. Once I had ordered my meal and it was brought to me, I was informed that the maple syrup I had asked for was not available. I was offered some substitute, which I did not want on my French toast (which I had asked for on brown bread, but came made with white). They offered to bring me a different meal. In the interest of keeping the peace (I was having breakfast with 5 other people), I accepted. 
3. The meal that was eventually brought to me was less that mediocre, and much to my dismay, I discovered part way through eating it that the bread on my plate was mouldy. At that point, I was done. The fascinating part was that I had to inform them that I would not be paying for the disaster that I had just experienced. 
5. The Crossfit going on upstairs felt like having breakfast under a jackhammer. 
4. Everyone at my table was seriously unhappy with our experience. We will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"The burger is very good. Right place at the right time. This place has improved quite a bit."}
{"text":"They moved from their location near Vendome metro to Sherbrooke, right opposite Mandy's. I'm writing a review based on their new location (since I've tried both). The service is slow and the waitresses don't have great instincts, which slows down the pace of the service even more BUT the saving grace here is the food. Our favourite menu items are the famous Copoli burger that comes with fries and is very unique both in taste and look, as well as their delicious selection of pizzas (personal favourite is Vegetarian #1). Be warned though that the pizzas take longer so be patient. Would I go back? Yes, we've ordered from there a couple of times when we want large portions of yummy comfort foods."}
{"text":"Went out looking for a place to grab a beer with friends, decided to stop in here for the first time. 

Cute decor, pleasant and very quick service. The server was quite nice and nice touch of bringing us peanuts to munch on. 

Reasonably priced beer (we got a pitcher of Stella). 

Fries were good but not the best I've ever tried  (maybe because I love the skins so that's on me.) 

Companion had the pepperoni pizza and loved it. 

Will def be coming back to try the veggie burger."}
{"text":"This is where I go when I just need something extra-heavy to stuff down the hatch. The fries are crap, no getting around that, pure greasy starch with no flavor (only tolerable doused in ketchup/whatever you like to dip with), but the burger! Smooshed flat and wide, topped with something resembling Thousand Island plus lettuce and tomato (and cheese and bacon if you want)...it's very satisfying, let's put it that way. Burgers are seasoned distinctively, which is a nice touch. About $11 for a cheeseburger and fries after taxes, but it could well be the only thing you need to eat all day, so it's not an everyday thing but it isn't exorbitant.

They do speak perfectly satisfactory English, and the service isn't anything special but it's fine for what it is."}
{"text":"This is the new location of the Copoli that used to be on De Maisonneuve. We went for brunch a couple of weeks ago and let me tell you, we were completely blown away. Now I know I know, this is a burger joint, how could I be raving about their breakfast. Well that's exactly why we were so surprised. I ordered the daily special and for $12 I got coffee, a pot of fresh-brewed loose-leaf Persian cardamom tea, assorted toasted bread, feta, cream cheese, a collection of homemade jams, including quince, sour cherry, pistachio carrot, and local organic honey, butter, fresh cucumber and tomato, and fruit. My boyfriend, who had ordered the standard eggs, bacon, and toast breakfast was perfectly satisfied with his breakfast until they served mine, when he proceeded to sample my extravagant breakfast. In the background, they were playing beautiful traditional Persian music as the couple who owns the local business hummed along with the music and interacted joyously with their customers. Long story short, don't judge a book by its cover. Go for brunch and ask for the Persian breakfast platter. You won't be disappointed, I promise ;)"}
{"text":"I love the chicken burger here! From the roll, to the pickles and sauce every bite is delicious. They are huge in size and the price is right! Another hidden gem on Mount Royal! Lucky us!"}
{"text":"I don't know where all the super harsh criticism is coming from. It's not your normal burger, its a Capoli burger. Yeah its the size of your head, but thats also because it's super flat and fairly dry. Its a decent burger, its just not one of those big beefy burgers with the soft buns that everyone is used to."}
{"text":"disgusting food.  No condiments.  Terrible service. Nobody speaks English or French here.  It's supposed to be Italian but no Italian food on menu..........gigantic expensive hamburgers"}
{"text":"Tonight I had a great \"TGIF\" dinner date with my Mom.  Copoli's is in a convenient location for both of us (5181 Boulevard de Maisonneuve O in NDG) so I can now finally say that I have actually had a meal while sitting IN the restaurant.  While I have ordered and have gone to get take-out before, it was really nice to enjoy the actual restaurant.

Copoli's is known for the \"Copoli burger\".  On their menu, they have a \"what you see it was you get\" photo of the 8? burger which means it is the real size of the burger and it honestly looks like the burger is bigger than my face.  It's huge.  I haven't tried anything else from Copoli's yet because I am so in love with the Copoli Bacon Cheeseburger.  They make home made buns and it is served with french fries and Copoli sauce.  It always tastes amazing.  It always leaves me with leftovers so it is almost like you get two or three meals.  I definitely know why they are said to have \"The Biggest & Most Delicious Burger in Montreal\".

My mom had the Steak & Pepperoni Sub and she really enjoyed it.  All of the subs are served with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, italian dressing and mozzarella cheese.  She let me bring some of it home and it tasted SO good (yes, I came home from supper and just continued to eat- the food is that good).

Copoli's serves a variety of Italian dishes too, such as 10 types of pizza, Brochettes, Souvlaki, Pasta, Sandwiches, Salads, Poutine, Soup, Smoked Meat, the list goes on and on.

The service was fast and the staff is always very friendly.  The restaurant offers a very relaxed atmosphere and if you sit near the window you can look past the Vendome metro station, past the train station and see the new MUHC.

I think everyone should try Copoli's at least once, especially for the famous Copoli burger.  For more information, call them at (514) 483-0000, visit their official site and be sure to like their Facebook Page.

You can even order online and you can save 10% on online orders over $20 with the coupon code \"COPO\"."}
{"text":"What can I say about Copoli burgers? Well for one, they're so big that they come in a small pizza box. Like pizza, they're also cut into slices. However, unlike pizza, you don't regret the decision minutes after your last slice. Oh yeah, and they're very reasonably priced. 

Besides the fries (which are amazing), I honestly haven't tried anything but their burgers, but it wouldn't surprise me if the rest of the menu is mind-blowingly delicious. 

A pleasant addition to Mont-Royal East, but probably to the detriment of Mange Moi."}
{"text":"One of the best unique burgers I have ever tasted. If you are looking for something different than the generic 'Hamburger' from Five Guys or La Belle Province, Copoli is the perfect place for you.

They serve delicious and huge \"8-inch\" burgers with very tasty seasoned beef patty. Everything from the burger to the fries is cooked to order making the food really hot and fresh. I never tried the rest of the menu but I bet everything is as good as the burgers and there's definitely something for all tastes: sandwiches, subs, salads, poutines, etc. Next time you are on Mont-Royal St. and looking for one of the best unique burgers"}
{"text":"La pizza est bonne, ils sont ouvert tard ce qui est apprecié dans le coin, bon service, musique relaxante et ecran tv en silencieux :)))"}
