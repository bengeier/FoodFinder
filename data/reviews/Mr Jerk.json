{"text":"I'd heard good things about Mr. Jerk but seeing is always believing. I always order the same thing: a curry chicken roti, rice and peas with gravy and a dumpling and the taste never disappoints.    The environs are gritty, but when the food can stand on its own like that, it's all good.  Dives like this typically have the best food.  The curry reminds me of my childhood as does the warmth and friendliness of the owner.  One of my favorite things about Mr. Jerk is the motley crew of people lined up inside awaiting their next yummy meal...every colour; every flavor.  Now, THAT'S Toronto. A real gem in the city.  I would prefer my food be warmer, but I always get take-away so I warm it up again when I get home."}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall take out spot is a hidden gem. We had a jerk chicken and jerk pork combo with plantain, rice & peas, and coleslaw and it was amazing! The ox tail gravy over the rice adds great flavor. Make sure to ask for the coleslaw on the side if you don't want to many flavors mixing together.   If you want some authentic Jamaican food - Mr. Jerk is definitely the place to go. Oh, and don't forget to add their homemade pepper sauce for an extra kick!"}
{"text":"Excellent jerk chicken but they can be a little inconsistent at times. Last time I went the chicken was overcooked and dry. The rub however is consistently good, a kick with complex spices smoked into the skin and meat.   Not a place you can dine in, no tables (not like youd want to anyways, looks dirty) and the portions are generous. For what you pay, around $10, you get a lot.   Service is slow as fck, a true sign the place is legit lol.   Recommend this place, top 20% jerk chicken in GTA."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem! The jerk pork mix with their source are fatty with a hint of their spice. The 8 dollar dinner is a bit pricy but it's worth it. If not you can try their  jerk sandwich for 5 bucks. The downside is that the place is small and often understaff and a line is form."}
{"text":"Good food for good price. Don't expect the service tho. Probably why they don't charge for the service. And they don't open on Sunday."}
{"text":"I'm not rating the food because I never had a chance to eat it due to the poor customer service. I went there for lunch today and it was an awful experience the lady serving food and taking money without washing her hands has the ability to talk to you anyhow she likes with the worst attitude. this is a family business so I guess they don't care how they treat people it really is a shame I took my money elsewhere and I won't be going back there however is a good carribean restaurant up the road called da house of jerk they take pride in their food and customer relations"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars for the one item I tried.   Jerk Pork Sandwich ($4.99).    Awesome. Tender, flavourful jerk seasoning. The Slaw and sauce they put in it just brings it to another level.   I haven't tried their other dishes but they would use the same pork or chicken in the sandwich as they would for their dishes.    So I can ascertain that the same quality and skill in their cooking would apply to their other dishes.   I highly recommend ordering from them or making the effort to go out of your way to check them out. I know I will.     The place does seem a little sketchy at first based on its location, and inside, like more Carribean take out places are very basic (not updated)  Note, they do not take credit or debit."}
{"text":"Had the jerk chicken, it was dry, not that much jerk flavour. The oxtail gravy tasted more like a beef gravy. The only good thing was portion size. Won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"It's only ok - for one the place looks kinda dingy - and don't get me wrong, if you're getting take out it should be all about the food but if the place looks dingy, it really detracts from the food when you're sitting around waiting for your food. I tried the jerk chicken and it was pretty mild - not particularly flavourful or spicy. I prefer Ackee Tree on king and spadina. On the upside the prices are very low."}
{"text":"Don't let the sketchy appearance fool you: this is some dynamite Jerk!  Unbelievably cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"Had oxtail and a side peice of jerk chicken (don't judge) and both were excellent. To the spice lovers, the jerk will not burn your mouth out, but they have homemade hot sauce for you. The oxtail was stewed long and super flavourful. Don't let the neighbourhood keep you away, the place is clean, the people are friendly, and the food is good :D"}
{"text":"Great price great food! Been coming here for years and they never disappoint. Service is always fast and great. Friendly neighbourhood joint that always delivers with authentic taste. Their jerk chicken and pork are the best. Can't beat the price too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place has so much wasted potential!  Their food needs to be tweaked just a bit to deliver the mouth watering West Indian  flavours. If you happen to be in the area try the curried meats. Party's lack stuffing and the Jerk sandwiches need some sort of moisture ... Coleslaw perhaps.. Otherwise the flavour is there just a tad on the drier side. Not quite your bang for your buck place but defiantly worth trying if you have the craving for some old school caribbean curries!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. The jerk pork, the curry chicken, the curry beef... Add some rice and peas and top it off with an order of plantain to experience heaven.  It's a small place with a lot of customers, so try to visit during non-peak hours to avoid the lineups. Lunchtime when there's school or local construction, and 6pm during the week seem especially busy to me. (It is worth the wait though, believe me.)"}
{"text":"100% authentic West Indian/Jamaican food. The goat curry roti was dynamite good, and the jerk chicken almost always has line-ups out the door. If you're looking for jerk chicken and dont want to break the bank, go here. A meal with a drink will run you around $8. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"The best Jerk everything I have ever tasted. The menu is extensive. Inexpensive. Generous helpings. Expertly assembled  by the sweetest lady in the food service industry. This could be the smallest restaurant in Toronto but the flavours are gigantic. Strictly take out."}
{"text":"really nice people running this place. Decent curry goat, a bit dried out jerk chicken.. but thats probably because of the time of day we went in at."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken itself isn't bad. It's definitely flavorful, but a bit lacking on the seasoning. On the other hand, I feel like other places I've been to tend to *over*-season, so I'll give them credit for not over-seasoning. The portion sizes are good for their price, and the lunch special comes with a drink.  The coleslaw tastes a bit bland too, like a salad without dressing, although I suppose that's a good thing, since it's healthier without all the dressing.  The lady who works there is nice, so that's a bonus too.  All in all, decent place for a lunch and I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"To.die.for.patties! The pastry crust was just amazing as it was fresh,flaky, with a slight sweetness but still savoury. The filling was flavourful and a little spicy. Can't wait to get it next time!"}
{"text":"It's slightly dirty, and the server wears rubber dish washing gloves to both receive money for the register and serve your food (washing hands, in gloves, in between).  Food was ok."}
{"text":"Whenever I've dropped by there has been a fairly large line in the store, and to be honest I can't really figure out why. I've gotten oxtail and curry goat a handful of times, and the food can range from bland to amazing.  The service also leaves something to be desired; I'm not expecting forced joviality, but to be acknowledged when I've walked in is nice.  The food on offer is Chinese and Caribbean, and they also have Allan's bread for sale. I've only ever had the Caribbean food and picked up a loaf or two of bread.   I'd have to recommend Sunrise or Twice As Nice for food, and walking a few doors down to Charley's West Indian Grocery for a fresher bread selection, or even better, heading to the Allan's bakery near Markham and Steeles. The meals served at Mr. Jerk is just too hit or miss, especially for pricier items like oxtail."}
{"text":"How did I not mention the patties?! Best patties I've had in the city (although I haven't ventured anywhere on Lawrence yet). Let's at least go with best patties downtown. Everything is made in-house. The shell is flaky and delicious. The filling is spicy and delicious.  Did I mention it's delicious? And only $1.50/patty!"}
{"text":"Great pork. Best ive had to date. Not the best place for a roti but they do put a lot of meat into it. The girl that works there is super nice. Id recommend the combination dinner , pork for sure and depending on what you like another meat."}
{"text":"I only get the jerk pork lunch with rice and peas with oxtail gravy and steamed vegetables, the absolute best, patties are amazing always. Very friendly people"}
{"text":"This is a neighbourhood institution that has been around for ages. So why was today my first visit? Beats me!  I ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich. They have the chicken roasted and under a hot lamp, and chop them to order. The sandwich was topped with fresh coleslaw and I added pepper sauce for a bit of heat.  The flavour on the chicken was nice. Lots of five spice coming through. The coleslaw was surprisingly fresh, and had great texture. It complemented the meat well. The Scotch Bonnet based pepper sauce was on point. Nice and spicy!  The only thing that was a bit of a let down was the stodgy white bun that it was served on. I don't think it was Cocoa Bread, because I've that before and it's delicious. This just didn't taste super fresh."}
{"text":"Jerk me up before you go go. Jerk it real good. Jerkin on heaven's door. We will, we will jerk you.  You get the picture."}
{"text":"After visiting my dad in the nursing home, my son and I went to MrJerk. Had the oxtail and the jerk pork. Very good food and decently priced."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall is putting it lightly but don't be judging!  The food is why I go!  The chicken roti is just how I like it, thick, rich, and heavy.  The roti shell itself was soft and with just enough chew and thickness to hold all its innards in place.  There was an order the owner was doing of 9 jerk chicken dinners so apparently jerk chicken is a hit!    Also I tried a side of rice and beans and it was really surprisingly good for something so simple.  Pass on the dumplings-it was like a huge fried tim bit and it wasn't salty or sweet.  Maybe I was supposed to dip it into something?    It's service with a smile and to top it off the owner is uber nice. For the busy lunch hour, I suggest maybe call ahead and place your order for pick up otherwise you could be waiting in line for awhile."}
{"text":"dont get me wrong this place is great on the food but the service there sucks theres always this black lady fighing and yelling at customers i love the food there but i will never go there again to far for me and not worth the wait anymore everyone check the one in downtown core and see what im talking about maybe the sould use a debit machine like 2014 i think the sould fire them hire new people just saying"}
{"text":"what i have to say about this mr jerk way better the malton one no fights when you good food i got jerk chicken for my gyal and jerk pork for my self it was so good and it was made fast 15 years strong in bleckers area i anit going back to the malton one ever again"}
{"text":"It's true - best roti in Toronto, hands down. Both the oxtail stew & the goat roti are mouth-watering, divine creations.  The jerk is, as others have stated, wonderfully flavored and I've found all meat perfectly cooked. I also really liked their festivals.   I found the spice level to be just what I tend to like: about a 3.5 to low 4 out of 5.   The reason I only rated 4/5 is the lack of seating - this place has maybe 2-3 seats, and is really a take-out place. Luckily roti and stews are always good reheated!   Meals are about $10 - $13 per person and are most definitely worth the quality of the food. With regards to quantity, I always have to divide it into 2 meals, as they sure do pack a fair amount into those takeaway boxes!"}
{"text":"I remember this place to have some decent jerk but I think something must have changed as sadly its the worst in  memory.  The rice and peas are dry like the bones that most of this chicken consists of.  There is very little flavour to the jerk and the gravy is nonexistent.    If your a fan of good pipping hot and moist full flavoured jerk with delicious gravy smothering some rice and peas, skip this one.  Unfortunately,  the food from this spot is as fresh and disgusting as the environment it's served in."}
{"text":"best jerk in the city. they use real charcoal to do the cooking in the back. best are the crunchy dark bits with smokey flavour."}
{"text":"What's jerk chicken and rice and beans without Coleslaw??? I just need that answered  Instead I got some lettuce and sliced tomatoes  I've been craving Jamaican food for 2 weeks (FYI) I'm pregnant !till my stomach could handle it then no coleslaw bye!never again"}
{"text":"This is strictly a review based on the food. I've never had the opportunity to personally buy from here, but have consistently been on the receiving end of their take-out jerk chicken :)  The Jerk Chicken, the coleslaw, the rice, THE SAUCE (4.5/5): Yummmmmmmm!! Tis a good meal when put altogether, whereas one without the other will make it incomplete! The chicken is tender on the inside and completely covered in the spices that make up jerk chicken. It's cut in decent sized pieces for easy sharing amongst family and friends. The rice+beans is a great colour and isn't dry nor too mushy, but is good consistency when eating with the chicken. However, add THE SAUCE on top of the chicken + rice and you've got the ultimate combo of taste + texture to make it all go down smoothly. I personally don't have any tolerance for heat, whereas I know jerk chicken can get pretty spicy sometimes, but this place does a great job keeping it low enough so I don't burn my sensitive taste buds nor have a runny nose at the end of my meal :P The coleslaw is a great addition to help balance out the oil and heaviness of the rice and chicken. It's definitely more on the fresh side than drenched like other typical chain restaurants.  Overall, a great meal that I always look forward to having time and time again. Thanks Mr. Jerk!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Do not let the grimy facade fool you, this place has some kick-ass Caribbean food. If you like Pork, try the  jerk pork on a coco bun, and say hell yes to the gravy. The pork is crispy, moist and flavourful jerky goodness! The patties are tasty, as is the chicken. This place has loads of character and many characters. If you find yourself in St. James Town with a hankering for Chinese-Jamaican do yourself a favour and go here."}
{"text":"I always get the rice and peas with a little oxtail gravy. The proportion sizes are great. The staff aren't the most professional though."}
{"text":"Been going their for years and I'm never disappointed. I know what I'm getting every time, and thats great food!!"}
{"text":"I've traveled to one end of this fine city to the other in search of jerk pork and seriously, these guys make undoubtedly the best the there is.  I grew up in Malton (by the airport) and there's is one at the corner of Derry Rd. and Goreway Dr. with free parking With line ups out the door at lunch, you know you've hit the jackpot."}
{"text":"hands down my absolute favourite jerk place!  been coming here for years (10plus) and therefore have no need to try other places as it's usually a disappointment when compared to mr. jerk.  my boyfriend and i usually get a bit of everything as it's all so yummy and we can't just choose one item.  he likes the beef stew/rice and peas, i, the 1/2 jerk chicken/rice and peas.  put the gravy on the rice not the chicken as it does mask the jerk flavourings.  then we'll get a chicken roti to share and a half pound of jerk pork (no gravy)...drool!  funny because it's not that we live far (5 minute drive south) but just can't order one item.  soup is good, oxtail is great too.    good portions, very friendly and usually a lineup, sometimes out the door! daily lunch specials.  cash only so be prepared, otherwise there is an atm at the neighbouring beckers.   i will have to try the 'ritz' but in my opinion, better than 'island foods' and 'bachus roti'.  bachus always tastes 'tinny' to me.  don't know whether it's the pan they heat the roti on or the aluminum/paper wrapping it comes in but it tastes tinny to me everytime!"}
{"text":"Mr. Jerk is extremely dirty, the staff handles money and then touches the food right away.  The floors are always dirty, the ATM machine has been broken for 7 months and they only accept cash.  Last week I found a fake fingernail in my rice.   This place has by far the worst customer service I have seen in my life. They are extremely rude, they have no patience to explain their menu options and they do not even say thank you or have a nice day after you pay.  I would give this place zero stars if possible. This has to be the dirtiest, smelliest restaurant I've been too.  The laziness of the staff is on another level, they don't even mop the floors I can not imagine what the kitchen looks like.  I've went twice and both experiences have been horrible.  That being said I have to give credit where credit is due. The chicken is tender with lots of flavour.  However I will not go to a place where the staff is lazy, rude and I can't eat at a dirty restaurant even if it is take out. Who knows how dirty the kitchen is.   STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"While visiting for Caribana  2015, I make a trip to Mr. Jerk for curry goat.  With the exchange rate being .75 to $1.00 local, I expected to pay less using US Dollars but was informed by the woman behind the counter it dollar for dollar.  In previous years when the exchange rate was flipped she had no problem using a calculator to make sure I paid the difference.   The meal was good but my friends and I will not be returning.  Especially when we were able to use cards every other place so there was no reason to convert money for a three day trip."}
{"text":"I remember when this place had lines out the door, now it's usually empty. I blame this on the poor customer service, attitude like I never experienced before and to top it off the food has gone far down hill. Think it might even be a health and safety concern because of how dirty it is now!"}
{"text":"They give the tinest about of food ever out of ever carribean food spot I've ever been to in my life.also extremely over price.i would not recommend this place unless you have no other option"}
{"text":"Tiny joint,  great for takeout.  Love their hot sauce and ox tail gravy.  Way better than some of those new jerk restaurants."}
{"text":"The jerk pork is well spiced with just the right amount of char.  The meat is moist and juicy with lots of great jerk flavour.  The bean rice is a little soft but that could be because of the extra ox-tail gravy I asked for.  It makes the tastier.  The homemade hot sauce is also a must try.  There is no seating, so take out only... But definetly worth a try if you like Jamaican style jerk."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many carib restaurants but this one takes the cake. I'm a regular here and will drive pass many others to get to mr.jerk.   Atmosphere: a whole in the wall so don't expect 5 star dining decor.  Food: very reasonable pricing and more importantly YUMMY. $1.50 for the best Jamaican beef patties in town. No brainer! These guys are known for their patties. Standing in line, you will notice everyone that makes an order, includes at least one pattie. They are almost pastry like. Typing this review is making me actually crave one.   Service: they only have one poor soul manning the cash and food so it can get backed up but, the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Get the jerk pork.  I bought a half a pound last time I went. Place is a dive.  But the jerk pork is excellent.  If you want sauce - get it on the side.  And if you like it hot - ask for hot sauce on the side.  I just get it to go in the summer.  Get a drink and walk and eat.  Or buy it and ride/drive to the beach and dig in.   Or I would just get some oxtail. Don't forget the hot sauce. The oxtail is a little fatty and gelatinous but this is the one time I don't care because it's so tasty.  I would just get some hardo bread with it.  Hardo bread is an acquired taste.  I love it having grown up with it.  I would get some plaintain only if it's fresh.  Dumpling only if it's fresh and hot.    I never tried their soup or their curry roti, nor their fish, but it's on my list.  I would only get their fish if they make it to order fresh.    I know my Jamaican food, having eaten almost everywhere excellent in Jamaica.  The food in Jamaica is one of the best in the world - as far as vacations go - especially if you like it hot.  Hit UP Mr. Jerk in the summertime!"}
{"text":"It's fast, affordable and hits the spot.  They always put a generous amount of sauce on your rice and beans.  The jerk chicken is great (though it's been dry from time to time).  The roti is also delicious."}
{"text":"The comments below kill me. LOL, especially with the questionable review below about the girl that says she can't get good service because of the colour of her skin... BAHHAHA girl, get over yourself. You're not that special. They are rude to everyone.  The people here are rude, but really and truly, if you level with them, then you'll just be annoyed. So I always just smiled, and always carry a little conversation. They always seemed to be nice. I've been going here for years, and yes they do have an attitude sometimes, but the food..... okay, the food. You just go, order, and get out.  I always get the Jerk Pork (about 2lbs of it). OKAY OKAY OKAY. Jerk Pork and they douse it with the oxtail gravy, girrrrrrrrlll.   I've tried pretty much all their Jamaican stuff. Curry goat, oxtail stew, stew chicken/beef. They are all great.  To add more grease to your booty, I always get cod fritters as well.. and a patty or two to eat on the ride home because I'm a fatty."}
{"text":"I'm no jerk chicken expert but this was pretty tasty. The one thing I would've preferred is a bit more freshness. Or maybe its the hours under the heat lamp that makes the fall off the bone so easily. I live pretty close as well so I imagine I'll be back, and the prices are pretty decent. Next time I'll have to try the pork."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel claustrophobic, it is a simple get-in & get-out deal. No place to sit, and if you take more than a minute to decide your orders, you might just cause a line, which could get very uncomfortable.  I wanted jerk chicken, and jerk chicken I got.  The portion is actually a leg with drum stick, plus a little bit of another leg served on rice & peas.  That is actually the most generous portion I've been served in any jerk place. The lady who served me was the most chill and friendly person who's ever jerked me.  HEH...  The chicken is decent, and they're not cheap with what they give you, so I guess it's worth the money.  It's been around for a long ass time, which means they're doing right by their customers.  I'm not an aficionado with Jamaican food, and I always thought that there should be more selection instead of just having rice & peas. Most Caribbean Islands don't eat rice & peas, I know they certainly don't in Trinidad & Tobago.    They are good enough to keep any other similar restaurants from opening in the area, which means they'll be able to retain me as a regular."}
{"text":"I've been to this location for the past 10 years because it was the first place I ever fell in love with jerk pork, however the last few years the quality has really gone down the drain. I kept coming back to give it \"one more chance\" for nostalgia sake but it just kept getting worse.   The jerk pork dinner was my go to but nowadays it's just a jerk fat dinner instead. It tastes like I'm just eating lard and no pork because the meat cuts I get is so fatty. If I wanted more coleslaw instead of rice, the owner (Asian man) would not give it to me. He also always gave noticeably smaller portions then the girl who works there and I didn't like that.  The curry roti still tastes ok but the last couple times I ate it I got a stomach ache... not sure what that means :/...   Side note: The girl who works there is very friendly and I liked going when she was working because she was always so kind and gave generous portions. Shame I won't be coming back here though because of the food. I'll be looking for my next favourite Jamaican place to dedicate another 10 years too, lol."}
{"text":"Love Mr. Jerk. Their pumpkin soup is exactly what I need on a cold winter day: pumpkin base, chicken, dumplings, carrots and potato. Followed by jerk chicken, rice and coleslaw with extra gravy. If I'm feeling like a beast, sometimes I get ginger coconut drops or tambran balls. Rel bess. I love their fried plantain too, but only when fresh. Sometimes they serve you cold, dry, tasteless plantain :( Yuck. Still, 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been to this spot 3 times now with a year. I have to say that today's experience was not up to their regular standards. We were there around 2:45pm. The place looked clean and the service was okay. My first two times the jerk chicken was spicy and juicy. The beef Pattie was thicker mix inside. The roti was more bone than anything. We are disappointed.  Today well my husband said it best, the cook must be on vacation. We might go back in the future but for the time being, we are going to look for a new spot. Hope they come back cause the staff are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I love jerk chicken but not a fan of this location. I've eaten here a number of times and I think it's an honest three star.  The good: nice portion size, tasty meal overall. The coleslaw adds a nice touch as well. The not so good:  Two hours to close and the gravy was a bit cold, there were pieces of bone that got mixed in when the chicken was cut up.  Overall - worth a try. Will go here still in a pinch."}
{"text":"What an honor that I get to write the first review of Mr. Jerk at Don Mills. Only logical reason is that the people who eat here don't yelp at all because there is no way they are complaining about the food.  I wouldn't have believed that such a small and obscure little shop could serve up one of the best grilled chicken and pork dishes in the GTA. Every visit is a treat and I always end up stuffed and happy after every meal.   A few reasons to love Mr. Jerk -great flavor -great prices (chicken and pork combo for 10$ that's good enough for 2 people) -great sides (plantains, coleslaw, and chili all mesh well together) -large servings -gravy and rice are awesome  I always order take-out and the worst part of the experience is the drive home hungry while the aroma of the grilled chicken fills the car."}
{"text":"Great quick eat. Large portions for cheap! Wished they took debit/credit. Cash only! Not quite sure how fresh the jerk meat is. It's usually in the window and I've never seen them come out of the kitchen. Also they don't have a restroom. They send you to the Library near by."}
{"text":"Good jerk chicken at a very reasonable price. This location is near the LCBO at the south east corner of Keele and Lawrence. You can eat in but you can't sit down. Mostly take out with a good daily lunch special. Friendly staff and fresh food due to it being very popular."}
{"text":"I have gone to other Mr Jerk locations for years and usually they are great for lunch take out. This location is very dingy and I found the owner had a poor attitude. I ordered the Jerk Pork lunch special and there wasn't much meat and what there was wasn't great. I have had way better Jamaican food. The Mr Jerk at Keele and Wilson is much cleaner and better. The ownership also seems to value customers unlike this location. I wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you go to eat but don't admit it. Foods real good and reasonably priced, it is just the location and the over all look of the place.  Friendliest service and fast, I do like the food and go  more often than I would like to admit."}
{"text":"Tiny little place. Awesome food, great service!! Love the jerk pork. Don't get me started on the ox tail gravy. It's to die for!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. I get the 1/4 jerk chicken with rice and peas and curry goat gravy. Chicken is one of the best jerk chickens I've had and the rice and peas are very tasty too."}
{"text":"I had to stop half way through my lunch here to write the review. Tiny little hole in the wall with mighty jerk. Paid 8 dollars for the lunch special which included 4 pieces of jerk chicken, coleslaw , rice and beans and I bought a dumping for gravy dipping. The jerk is rich , with a bit of heat but dosent overpower. The slaw and rice and beans are nice as well. I'm so full yet all I want to do is finish my chicken!   Recommended."}
{"text":"This place just nails jerk pork perfectly, at some west indian shops it's actually stewed (yuk) but the only way I'll have it, is this way, slow cooked over fire and allspice wood which gives it that beautiful spicy bark on it, their jerk pork is just divine, I've yet to find jerk pork as good in this city or even in this country to be honest, it's absolute perfection!!  Servings are large and filling too. At $10 a dinner, it's worth EVERY penny...  Their fried plantains are also done perfectly, as they use very ripe plantains and fry them to sweet perfection, many other places just never seem to get plantains right like this, mainly because of impatience as they don't let the plantains ripen fully before using them.   The Jerk chicken is also perfect as well, not stewed, but slow roasted, just so good!! Although the pork is my go to meal here, but when i do have the chicken, I'm never disappointed. Even their Roti is beyond good, whomever makes the curry there is a genius, so delicious!!, as you can see I have zero complaints for this place, as the food is just dynamite!!   Can't wait to have it again!! and they deliver too!! (via just eat)"}
{"text":"Probably the only authentic jerk pork in Toronto, roasted over a real jerk pit, with real jerk seasoning, not oven baked, or oven baked and then reheated on a outdoor grill like some places.  Tasty and flavourful, a real gem, with generous portions at a good price."}
{"text":"I'm dying of laughter reading everyone's take on the service.  I totally agree! It is horrible but I actually find it amusing now after coming here for over ten years.  I think my favourite part of the service is how they just stare at you, don't ask what you'd like, just stare!  And don't even think about hearing a thank you. I know what to expect when I walk in and that's dead pan stares and delicious food!  Their jerk pork dinner and sandwich is too damn tasty its worth the horrible service.  Their homemade pepper sauce is also delicious, not very hot but very flavourful.  If you go in knowing the service sucks, you'll actually get a kick out of it.  Prices are good and food is damn tasty."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look at appetizing, but the food is awesome. I tried the a small jerk pork around 12pm, and it was really tasty. The rice is fairly good as well. You don't get coleslaw, which i'm used to at the other places. Overall I'll go again for lunch."}
{"text":"We were intending to go someplace else for lunch but the kids feel asleep in the car so takeout it was! I decided it was time to try Mr. jerk since we were only in town another day. They were closed when we got there even though the sign said they were supposed to be open. When we turned to go back, we saw that they had opened and a long line was already forming! Got several lunch specials (1/4 chicken, coleslaw, rice with peas and gravy) and the Jamaican patty. The chicken was absolutely delicious, nice and spicy and the rice and peas were great with the gravy. Coleslaw was meh but then again, I wasn't there for that! Jamaican patty was also very tasty. I can't vouch for the authenticity of this place but the taste was excellent and there seemed to be a lot of Caribbean folks in line so that speaks volumes. Oh, we also tried fried plantains and those were pretty standard, nice and soft and sweet."}
{"text":"Such a find, as the food is awesome, prepared properly, with TLC, and the service is great. If you want to taste the ultimate in Jerk Pork, you came to the right place."}
{"text":"I have been going here for almost 15 years! I have never been disappointed with the food there. The owners are lovely. They always ask about my mom when I go in. The price vs. quantity and quality is worth it!"}
{"text":"My new favourite jerk spot in the area. Got the jerk pork dinner and it was fantastic. I was very impressed with the generous portions of meat included in the dinner. I also had a beef patty and it was also great. Don't forget to bring cash since they don't accept debit and credit for now. Next time I'll take pictures."}
{"text":"Mr. Jerk servers up some tasty Jamaican food at reasonable prices. It's a small space a little bit off the main streets, but if you're craving Jamaican food (I haven't had the stuff in a year) you don't mind walking a few minutes.   While I don't think it was much better than other jerk chicken places, the food was solid all around - well spiced, but maybe a little dry.   We tried the oxtail dinner, which was a serving of oxtail ontop of rice and peas ($9), 1/2 a jerk chicken a la carte (~$8), a pound of jerk pork (~$12 I think) and a spicy beef patty (~$2).   The oxtail was my favourite, it was cooked well and the meat was soft and tasty. The jerk chicken and pork were well spiced, but a bit dry IMO. The beef patty was fresh out of the oven, and really good. I'd choose it over Tasty's."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall. Pick up your food. Amazing portion. Great Food. Discovered this place during my college years and still frequently visit it during their lunch special."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best jerk I've ever had - the only con is \"sometimes\" the pork which i love so much gets a tiny bit dry. Nothing some gravy wont fix tho! Pretty huge portions, and the lunch specials are as good as it gets! I also order the meat la carte and make rice at home sometimes, perfect! Def recommend this gem of a joint if you happen to be nearby, you won't regret it!   Protip: Extra oxtail gravy bro."}
{"text":"I went to high school nearby so I grew up at Mister Jerk so I admit I'm a little biased, however for the price, I haven't found many places with better Jerk Chicken.   I just got back from Ochos Rios Jamaica, and had asked a cabbie to bring me to his favourite roadside drum jerk chicken. And honestly, that was THE best jerk chicken I'd ever had, especially with the Jamaican Ketchup and hot sauce. So if that's my measuring stick, Mr. Jerk's chicken is honestly not that far behind.   I also love their Curried Oxtail and Jerk Pork. The sauce is really the key.  I think the two Mr. Jerk restaurants in Toronto (the other one is located at the Peanut Plaza on Don Mills Rd, north of Sheppard) are run by a Jamaican Chinese family, as I found it quite amusing to see Asian people with a thick creole accents, even though I know there are alot of them in Toronto.   Both places are not a sit down restaurant and only wished they had a drive thru window! :)"}
{"text":"Dependable take out joint for serviceable jerk chicken.  I ordered white meat and received a decent portion for the price.  Chicken was moist and well seasoned with a good amount of heat.  I asked for gravy on the side and was given a few tablespoons of oxtail gravy which tasted a tad bland and reminded me of Bisto.  Against my better judgement I ordered a side of plantains 3 slices for $1.00 which is way overpriced for what you get considering plantains are not expensive.  Don't waste your time ordering them--they were dried out and were probably not ripe to begin with.  Overall decent but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Great food, the jerk pork is amazing. Get the rice and peas with jerk pork and some oxtail sauce on top. You would not be disappointed. They also have great home made beef patties. If your in the area, it is worth giving it a try, you will become a fan."}
{"text":"Although its appearance from the outside screams ghetto, the food catered by this West Indian restaurant that is operated by Chinese-Canadians is good and the prices are reasonable. Although their jerk chicken is a bit dry and the selection of sides such as rice, beverages and dish selection (no wings?) is limited, the loyal lines of patrons streaming out their front door during normal weekday lunch hours is testament of this eatery's popularity.  Lunch deals start at $5 and the turnaround time from the door to he cashier is reasonably quick. Only wish their jerk chicken had more gravy like the way neighboring Caribbean Taste (Greenwin Square @ 345 Bloor Street East) offers, because I like my chicken with plenty of jerk gravy and flavor and not dry."}
{"text":"Rude, rude, rude. Not sure why I shopped here for patties as often as I did, the service is horrible (the opposite of Jerk King at Morningside and Lawrence, my other patty place) I have stopped shopping here, they won't get any more of my money, they need to treat the customers well, we are the ones paying the bills."}
{"text":"Great jerk chicken and very friendly staff. The ordering area is SO small tho.  Chicken/pork/goat lunch special cost $7.25 with a free soda. You get coleslaw, rice and peas accompanying your meat selection. I prefer steamed rice myself.. but rice and peas seem to be the way to go when it comes to Caribbean food?.. Anyways there is not much customization for this price. The chicken fell off the bone and was delicious.   I also wish they had barbecue chicken but guess I can't have everything.. For now I think they serve good Caribbean food for a decent price."}
{"text":"Customer service here = horrible.  I saw the girl behind the counter - and she looked like she was doing NOTHING - so I said, \"excuse me how much for two things?\" [from their menu]. She first looked at me in a disgusting manner and then answered me in a such a rude way - I'm pretty sure I didn't ruin her Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter or life so why does she hate me and the world?   Not sure.  I think she needs Jesus in her life.   So after she told me the price in a condescending tone - I was about to order and she motioned to the guy behind me to order.....   Excuse me... wow.   I said to my friends out-loud I'm out of here - I'm going to Subway! So I went to Subway and had better service  - the guy at the Subway location is super nice. He made my day!   Never stepping into Mr. Jerk  location EVER again! Only jerks work there.   Work on your employee customer service please and thank you - ** Wow after reading all the reviews I'm glad I'm not the only one, I really thought it was because of my skin colour because my friends were the same colour as them and had better service than me... whatever never again!"}
{"text":"Very few places make jerk pork these days.  If yor are into Jamaican food this place is awesome.  I have had the Jerk chicken, pork, oxtail and much more.  Other than the long line ups at lunch everything is amazing.  Good things come to people who wait."}
{"text":"THE BEST JERK In TORONTO! No, not the owners, but the food.  It's just awesome. I've been going there for years but I think it's time to give some love back to this place that has helped me put on some pounds.  Ricky and his family emigrated to Toronto and has made this place into an institution.  As Angela H., the previous reviewer put it, \"it's a hole in the wall\", but the taste of all the food here is just incredible.  The Jerk is as authentic as you can get from Jamaica.  We love everything here so I cannot say what is my favourite.  They have specials of the day so ask before you order because you can save even more money.  We always try to get the soup because it's SOOO good.  The only problem is that they sell out of it so fast, so you should always get it.  One large order is enough for two people because they give you so much food.   They renovated recently so the place is a bit larger in the front but the food is still the same as before.  I paid $10.12 for a large jerk pork with rice/peas and vegies.   This is only place that I go to for the Jerk meats and if you go there at lunch time, there's always a huge line up, so try to go there either just before noon or after 2pm.  Their new location is just a few doors down from the new LCBO that they are building on in this plaza."}
{"text":"THEY ONLY TAKE CASH!  So if you're planning on dining, this is not the place.  Food looks and smells amazing, and the taste is definitely vigorous but the environment of the restaurant is so distraught.  Pop down, paint peeling, SKETCHY !!  Service is not great, lady is rude and rushing and very impersonal.  BUT, if your going for a quick pick up of some real soul Jamaican food, this is the place, don't dine or lounge around, grab your meal and GO! Area not the best either."}
{"text":"Had the jerk chicken lunch special. Chicken was extremely dry. Rice and peas was dry. Plantain was all mushy. Was charged $0.50 for using credit card. Cost me $10.00 with plantain. Ended up not eating the rest of it. It is a takeout place, so very tight spot. wouldn't recommend the place."}
{"text":"As always decent but nothing special but if the area and especially on foot this will probably become a staple if you eat out and like a little spice and seasoning.   Had the jerk chicken, nothing to write home about but good enough when hungry.  @Grant Never, ever buy Roti from a Jamaican spot, Trinidadian is the way to go (coming from a Jamaican)"}
{"text":"Best jerk pork I tasted. For some reason the jerk pork at other Mr jerk locations don't taste as good. Always good to stick with the original."}
{"text":"The best old school jerk around. Treat yourself... so good. Keep up the good work ladies"}
{"text":"Came in. Really small space. If more people came in, it'd be interesting trying to have two way traffic in and out of this place, because it's a take-out counter-esque hole-in-the-wall joint.   Met a couple who frequent this restaurant (they said it was their favorite takeout place. They recommend everything). They seemed super-friendly with the lady at the counter. Turns out the lady at the counter is super friendly even if you aren't a regular. She was really nice to me. I asked if I could get half a pound of the jerk pork. They sell it at $11/pound. She managed to get me exactly half a pound on her first try. Kudos to her.  Had: Only the jerk pork. I'm Chinese. I believe everything that was meant to be hot should be served scalding hot. This was warm. When I reheat my leftovers, I'm hoping they'll be better than when I had it today. That being said, it did not suck. I'm no expert on anything jerk related (food-wise). I like it, but I can't handle a lot of heat (spicy kind). This wasn't too spicy for me. That was nice. My pork was on the lean side. I saw some fattier pieces, but the chunk she chopped up for me was the chunk the previous couple had asked for, and they had specifically asked for something leaner. *sad* Nice spices though. Aromatic."}
{"text":"Saw this place on a bike ride down Bleeker St. Got a 1/4 Jerk Chicken w/ rice and oxtail soup. It was LOVELY. Extremely affordable ($7). I would ask for more peppersauce next time, but that's my only gripe. I'm pretty sure it's the best I've had in Toronto. The menu was HUGE, and I look forward to going back another time to try something different."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place. It's cash only, everything is fresh made. I had the jerk chicken roti with curry sauce and codfish fritter. It tastes exactly what I used to eat as a kid when my mama was visiting from the islands.  It's not expensive, it's quick and it's so filling.  I'm already counting down until I'm back for more"}
{"text":"I went in with an open mind despite its super ghetto exterior and interior to match, but this place is not good. All the food looks like it was cooked hours ago and sitting under heat lamps. Went with a couple of chicken curry roti's. Curried vegetables sounded like a decent side dish so ordered a small dish of those too.  The curry itself isnt bad, but the chicken is a mixed batch of dark and white meat, with some pretty ugly cuts of meat in the mix. Even looking past that, the real problem was the roti that wrapped it all. It was not fresh, good tasting, and worst yet had this weird gritty interior. Oh and the side of vegetables looked like a bowl of onions and cabbage. Didn't even try eating them.  Im really astounded that this place gets such good reviews but I guess their jerk flavoured stuff might be better? I'll leave it for the rest of the world to find out."}
{"text":"Yes, one of my favourite places for Jamaican takeout, in the Toronto area. They have amazing jerk pork and chicken, with rice and beans.  My favourites are the snapper and the kingfish (what can i say, I am an islander), with the home made hot sauce. YUMMY. Remember, if you can't handle the heat, don't ask for it.  The beef patties are also a honourable mention. Make sure they are fresh when you buy them.  There is a lot of entertainment here. Sometimes you will hear the 2 ladies at the front argue, with the heavy Patwa accent, all about nothing...quite entertaining."}
{"text":"Takeout Only - No Seating  Mr. Jerk is a small Caribbean takeout place in a strip mall on the northwest corner of Derry and Goreway, right at the edge of Mississauga.   They offer standard West Indian fare options, including jerk chicken and pork.  I had the jerk pork dinner with rice and peas and gravy. It was awesome. The pork was juicy, and its flavour was only enhanced by the gravy poured over it. Portion-wise, this was right on. It filled a typical half-sized takeout container, and was relatively equal on the meat/rice ratio.   Ideally, they'd have a stool or two for customers to eat inside, as there are no tables outside. I visited via public transportation that day and had to eat standing in the parking lot.   Other than this minor drawback, Mr. Jerk is a place I'd highly recommend if you're in the area. Good food."}
{"text":"Jerk Pork.  I must have Jerk Pork.  I check the Yelp App and what do I find? Missa (Mr)Jerk!!!!  I have only eaten at the Malvern, Keele and down-town locations,, this is gonna be exciting.  First I shall speak on the location of the take-out restaurant.  It is situated on the north side of Derry Rd (near 427) in large sized strip mall.  Plenty of free parking.  The restaurant is small, dimly lit and run down.  No crazy line ups observed.  It was around 8pm on a Saturday night.  FYI, they are open till 10pm on Sat. Nice.  My order consisted of one large Jerk Pork and and one large Jerk Chicken.  (Now being a self touted expert in the ordering of all things Jerky, I requested, oxtail gravy and rice and pea on both)   The only option I was given was if I wanted tomatoes with it.  Taken back by this offer of tomatoes, curiosity caused a nod of agreement.    I get home and open up the containers and to my surprise and delight I find a decent amount of both Pork and Chicken in both containers.  Not bad.  I have had better quantity levels at the other locations. The surprise was the two thick slices of tomatoes in each container.  No slaw or steamed cabbage but tomatoes!?  lol.  Let the feast begin.  lol. The Jerk Pork:  nicely blackened bark, meat moist and tender.  A perfect level of spice.  The Jerk Chicken: Moist tender and perfectly spiced.    Just add some pepper if you you like it hot.  The nice lady behind the counter did not offer pepper (hot sauce) as an option, so I just amp mine up with some of my Matouks.  The rice and gravy mix was delicious but i found a lot of dried up rice which caused a bit of dried up rice teeth pickin.  I could tell that the cook that prepared the Rice and Pea knew what they were doing when making the dish and blame it to improper containment.  Back to the Tomatoes.  It was an odd yet tasty pairing to the Pork and Chicken.  Would I go back?  HELL YEAH!!"}
{"text":"Best Jerk I've had in the downtown core and it's not particularly close. If you're strung up for cash I highly recommend getting the jerk pork by the pound. You get a very generously sized serving of meat for around $5. It's also nice because you don't have to order by weight, too, you can just ask for $7.50's worth for example.  Anyway, this place rules and the owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered the ¼ chicken jerk and it was honestly not very good. The chicken was tender but there was absolutely no flavour at all. The chicken was bland, gravy was bland, coleslaw had no flavour as well. Thought the food would have at least some spice or taste too it but it was comparable to bland hospital food. Definitely would not order from here again"}
{"text":"Lunch special is small dinner with canned pop or a bottle of water is my go to. Super friendly family run business. Can be quite busy at times. Jerk pork is juicy and flavourful."}
{"text":"As per usual, a great restaurant ruined by ignorant staff. No napkin or cutlery...am I suppose to eat with my hands?? Tired of feeling like a burden to employees when I enter an establishment to order food. It is your JOB--if you don't like it, QUIT. Is there ANY Caribbean restaurant in Scarborough where I can go and receive EQUAL service? You clearly see the demeanor and attitude  change when a customer comes in who is, how can I say...NOT WHITE. On my list of never agains, along with Sunrise and a few others. I liked it much better when the Asian ladies worked there."}
{"text":"This really deserves no stars but the presentation of the food looked it. I ordered a large Oxtail dinner. What a waste of money! The Oxtail had know seasoning except for salt. It taste like salt and cooking oil. Never again will I ever order Oxtail fm Mr.  Jerk. My opinion is to stick to the jerk pork/chicken!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Jerk chicken for dinner. I've heard great things about this place and tons of people say its the best in the city. So i'm pretty sure I just had a bad batch. The chicken seemed like it was sitting out for a long time and was really under cooked."}
{"text":"Great Chicken, great gravy. Jerk pork is one of the best I've had. Pattys are great from what I understand they get them from allens bakery which is a plus. Owners are extremely friendly as well which is a big plus."}
{"text":"Picked up some jerk chicken here on my never-ending quest to find the best Jerk in Toronto.  Pretty tasty, I must admit, but not the best.  That title belongs to the Ritz Caribbean at Yonge & Carlton.  I sure as hell won't turn down jerk from here, but it's not the pinnacle of Jerk perfection."}
{"text":"This place is just fantastic. The jerk pork is phenomenal...best I have ever had. You get a very generous portion no matter what you order, especially for the prices, which are really decent for how high quality the food is (basically any meal is 10 bucks or less). I asked for callaloo and the woman who runs it didn't have any made, so what does she do rather than say they're out, but she makes an entire fresh batch and it is unreal. The rice and peas are great, as others have mentioned, and the plantains are excellent as well- nice and crispy along the edges, but soft and a little sweet. I think the best thing about Mr. Jerk is the fact that their food is consistently delicious, never one to disappoint. It is by far my favorite Carribean restaurant in this or any other city. Just a heads up that it's cash only."}
{"text":"Amazing jerk chicken, jerk pork and chicken soup! The portions are huge and the prices are cheap! Cash only."}
{"text":"Great spot! Some of the better jerk chicken and pork I've eaten in Toronto.  Owner is really nice guy, laid back, easy going..  place is very small and can get really annoyingly crammed, I just walk away when that line is out the door.  Better than Ritz anyday!"}
{"text":"I recently went to a concert at the Phoenix, and decided to hit up Mr. Jerk beforehand due to its high yelp rating. Following recommendations from other users, I picked up some jerk pork (and a fritter) while my friend grabbed the curried oxtail. The pork was incredibly moist and had a great amount of charring on it, while the oxtail was as flavourful as it gets. Both meals came with rice and peas as well as a great coleslaw which balanced the richness of the meats. Portion sizes were good, especially for the price. Other than the obvious negative aspect of the lack of ambiance/cleanliness at Mr. Jerk, the only thing stopping me from giving it five stars is that I found the sauce that was poured over my pork (on the recommendation of the guy behind the counter) was far too peppery - not too spicy, but literally had too much pepper in it so that I couldn't fully taste the pork. All in all the meal was very satisfying and tasty, and I would go there again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"This Mr Jerk here is located at Peanut Plaza on the outside of the plaza near the Beer Store. These places are always so tiny with this one being no exception. The girl at the counter was super excited and friendly. She was singing songs and was having a great time whipping up the food. The menu offers up jerk chicken and jerk pork with some additional items like goat, patties, and rice. Prices are very cheap and don't expect a place to sit down.  I was going to get the jerk chicken dinner, but I opted for the jerk pork sandwich because they had it on special for $5 and change and comes with a pop. The sandwich is their jerk pork wrapped inside their coco bread served with coleslaw and hot sauce. The jerk pork was oh so tender and juicy. Jerk chicken here can be a bit dry so opting with the pork is the ideal plan here. The pork has this wonderful little bark too which I love about the meat. The coco bread was soft but a bit cold as I think it was sitting there for a bit. The coleslaw was sweet and crunchy and blends well with the hot sauce to add the right kick to the sandwich.  I always find that parking at the Peanut Plaza can always be such a pain so just be on the lookout. The place itself is strictly for takeout and only takes cash and debit. The place is open a bit later than many other places, but as with most, the earlier the better."}
{"text":"So Mr Jerk in Mississauga is a little known place and is pretty tucked away from it all.  Even when you go into the plaza you may not see it.  It probably is one of the smallest shops I've been into, but man does it pack a punch.  Now first fore-warning.  I've found that the stuff here is hit and miss, and it all depends on the time of day you go.  The ideal time for deliciousness is 11:30AM.  Why?  Cause the ladies at Mr. Jerk just brought out all the jerk pork from the oven and are ready for the lunch rush!    You may hear me rave about the jerk pork here, and it's because it's the best around.  Trust me... it's amazing!  I've had it and it was a bit dry at times, but that's mostly because I went at around 12:45pm-1pm so I blame myself.  If you go at around lunch, you'll most likely be waiting out past the door.  Apparently word has spread about this place and the people that do go there keep coming back.  The same thing is pretty much on everyone's mind... jerk pork.  I've tried the jerk chicken from this place and it's not too too great... but that's not why you come here.  If you're in the area and it happens to be 11am-ish be sure to try the jerk pork dinner one of these days.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Grew up on their Jerk Pork sandwich, absolutely fantastic.  Moist, flavourful and the perfect char for the extra bit of crisp and flavour.  The coconut bread is extremely fragrant and compliments the savory jerk pork perfectly.  The hot sauce is great as well.    The Jerk chicken is quite good as well, but not as good as the pork and can be slightly dry depending on the day.    The staff have all been there since I can remember, definitely over 10 years.  The lady is fantastic and gives better portions than the guy."}
{"text":"My first experience here was bad. I got the jerk chicken with rice and peas and a side of Cole slaw.  the rice was over cooked the jerk chicken was bland. I was disappointed because I heard so many good things about the place. The grape vines said it depends on who the cook/worker/server is that day. Maybe I went on a bad day. I decided to give them another chance. This time I ordered the bbq chicken with hot sauce and rice and peas. This time the food tasted great. The rice was done well and the gravy is was delicious and savory. The bbq was juicy and flavourful with every bite. I also got a beef patty and that was very declious. They sell the same patties other places so it wasn't new to me."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best jerk spot in Toronto. I like the Malton location best but was never disappointed with any of their several locations scattered across the city. The jerk has this amazing smokey punch you in the face flavour. I fiend for this place. The oxtail gravy on my rice n peas is something I tell my family and friends about. Keeps me coming for more, more, more!! I recently had the curry chicken dinner and let me tell you, so on point. I've been under the impression that the Trinidadians and Guyanese (shout out Alima's roti in Brampton... still my favorite roti spot) made the best curry but the Jamaicans can hold their own. This place made me a believer. Anything you get on the menu is a hit. You will not be left disappointed. It will scratch any itch you have."}
{"text":"(JAMAICAN ACCENT) The oxtail has too much fat, the jerk is the bomb, and coleslaw is even better, BUMBACLOT....."}
{"text":"This is great carribean food. It's pure and delicious and well made. Succulent jerk chicken and pork and solid rice and beans and salad. Can't wait to see how the beef patty tastes."}
{"text":"I seriously think this place serves the best jerk chicken and pork in the city.  I used to live down the street from this place and had never tried Caribbean prior to eating here so I thought that this was just the norm but after trying some of the other popular caribbean restaurants in the city I have to say that this place is just the best!  The chicken and pork is always succulent in the centre and not dried out and it's always got a the perfect jerk crust.  I'm not a huge pork fan but the pork is totally out of this world.  It's just super flavourful right through to the centre and always moist with just the right amount of fat skimming the edges.  Their rice and peas again, are not dried out and full o' peas and the slaw is  slightly sweet and vinegar-y and actually adds to the flavours and textures of a jerk combo meal.  And then what makes it even more perfect is that I'm pretty sure it's the most generous serving in Toronto as well as the best price.  Their other dishes are great as well especially the soups!    Fanfriggintastic."}
{"text":"Customer Service was superb! Chicken was okay nothing spectacular. For people looking for a bang for their buck this is a place to go. I just wished they had better hot sauce than some bottled hot sauce."}
{"text":"Totally authentic jamacian food. Not in the best area but the food is worth the trip to the dive. Get the jerk chicken or pork."}
{"text":"Good old reliable Mr.Jerk.  Would use it more often if they were open another hour longer. For a Caribbean take on curry, their version is my personal favourite, completely different & distinct from anything Indian, I also like their Jerk, the seasoning mix is just as I prefer it - and also like how you can get he curried potatoes as a stand alone item when you just want to bring home an exciting side dish.   Still one of the best Beef Patties anywhere, although it's not as good as it used to be in the 90's & early 2000's when their patties had that sublime, flaky crust.    The downsides - other than obvious lack of an actual restaurant and inconvenience  of coming by car - some side dishes tend to be forgettable - Rice & Peas usually a little chalkier than they need to be ,,, the meat_to_bone ratio on the Goat tends to be even more problematic than usual - and while I love the seasoning mix on the Jerk, the meat itself is sometimes a bit dry compared to the very best (maybe a bit longer marinade time and slower cooking would help). for these reasons I don't give it a full 5, but it's still an amazing take-out for the money."}
{"text":"The best jerk pork around!   (Having said that, we much prefer the roti from Roti Boys at Sheppard and Pharmacy.)"}
{"text":"okay- i used to go to Mr. Jerk when i was in London. wondered if they had the chain somewhere in North America. well, on a business trip to Toronto- one of my lovely co-workers did some research on the net to find one! i seriously missed the Roti (Trinidadian flat bread).  APPARENTLY... there's a Mr. Jerk in West Harlem (NYC). woo! anyway, i will get to that one later... this time around, we headed to the one on Wellesley.   besides the Chicken Roti (chicken curry rolled in a flaky-buttery flat bread)- the Jerk Chicken w/ rice, beans and plantain is my staple order. occasionally- i'll crave for a beef patty for the road. please, i recommend NOT putting the gravy on the chicken. no, no, no, my friend! the pineapple jerk chicken is another good choice--- you can get that one for 9.50 pounds in London, i'm too sure about the prices here, though. i've heard great things about the Oxtail dish, but i'm not a fan of that kind of meat."}
{"text":"My colleague and I decided to try Mr. Jerk for lunch a couple of Fridays ago as we were craving jerk pork.  We arrived around 12:15 p.m. or so and it was packed in there. As we were closer to being served, I noticed an ATM machine on the premises that was out of service. We were then told by one of the patrons that Mr. Jerk accepts cash only but to go to the dollar store in the plaza as it has an ATM machine.  OK, so we had to line up again and, this time, as we were approaching being served, they said that they were out of jerk pork and we had to wait 15 minutes. Oh man, was my colleague frustrated - this is the lunch hour on a Friday. Who runs out of food?!? Anyway, we both ordered the jerk chicken (white meat) with peas and rice and a Jamaican patty. I think I paid about $13 so not that inexpensive.  We went back to the office and immediately started eating. The chicken could have used some more jerk seasoning but otherwise it wasn't bad. The peas and rice were perfectly seasoned and cooked with the right amount of bite. What we really LOVED was the patty. I don't know if they make them onsite but it had lots of meat with the perfect amount of spice and would rival Allan's or Tinnel's.  One thing I wanted to note is that the service was very polite. We didn't get any attitude as some of the other reviewers noted.  Anyway, it was good but it can't compare to Mitzie's."}
{"text":"Another place I had to try on reference basis. First look of the place ... Looks old school run down. But alright. Staff courteous, fast. Took a 1/2 jerk chicken lunch with rice / beans and oxtail sauce. Good quantity of both the rice and chicken.   Taste test: chicken was too hard, not moist. As if it had been made long before and reheated again an again.  Not appetizing. The rice cooked almost alright but not fully didn't have enough flavour for what they should have in rice and beans. Could barely taste the oxtail. The salad given on top seemed fresh though.   Overall disappointing experience. Not a place I'd head back to."}
{"text":"Really good jerk chicken! Im pretty much a regular at this point, I always order the quarter chicken dinner or if i make it for their lunch special i grab their jerk chicken lunch special which is the same thing except both cheaper and you get a soda, these prices range from 7.50 (tax included) to a bit over 8.   They also have pretty decent fried corn bread and patties, though their patties are a little gross looking inside the flavor is quite good if you dont mind the copious amount of sauce. The pastry is definitely the best part as it's light flaky and buttery.   If you pass definitely don't pass up the chance to go in and grab some jerk, remember to ask for their delicious gravy and coleslaw!"}
{"text":"I went to this place because of a friends review on it. I decided to get the curried goat roti because that is one of my dishes. Unfortunately I was disappointed, first off they microwaved the roti bread which was a little shocking to me especially because they were charging $10 for the roti. It came with the bone in which isn't a huge issue but I would have preferred to have the bones out. Overall, it tasted okay, but I won't be going back there again any time soon."}
{"text":"Authentic West Indies/Jamaican food.  This place has some of the best jerk chicken in the area. It was recently listed as one of the top Jerk places in the GTA and it's very deserving of that honour. The jerk pork here is killer!   Jerk chicken dinner with rice and peas will run you about $10  Don't expect to be able to go and eat here. It is strictly take out and at lunch time this joint is lined up out the door. Try to be there for 11:45 for best results.   Also, be warned it is CASH ONLY!    Would be 5 star, but the service can be brusque and impatient at times."}
{"text":"Love this jerk spot. I've had everything on the menu including the festivals. Ox tail is good priced by weight. Jerk pork out of this world with rice and peas with oxtail gravy and slaw. Always huge portions. Wash it down with a Grace cream soda pop. Lunch special is cheap !! Line up so get there early. Tight spot no seats take out only. Hit it up :)"}
{"text":"They make amazing beef patties so buttery and burst with flavours with the right amount of spiciness. They go through big volume you could alway expect they are fresh from the oven.  The pastry is so fresh, way better than frozen heat up in the oven in most of the shops.  Jerk chicken and the chicken soup are decent! Even some restaurants are not as good and of course you pay more. They always super busy that's how you know the food is great ."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and feeling hungry so figured I'd see what yelp had to offer. Don't eat much jerk, as although I like spicy food, jerk is often too spicy. Decided to have the jerk pork sandwich and asked if I could get it only mildly spicy. The lady said it's already made, so I decided to take a chance. Turns out it was the perfect spice for me and extremely tasty. Jerk pork coleslaw and gravy on the 's sandwich for $5.99. Will definitely come back next time I'm in this area for more tasty food."}
{"text":"Best jerk pork in the GTA! I've tried many. Been going to this location for more than 20 years."}
{"text":"Hmmmmmm yummy. I prefer a more saucy coleslaw but it was good nonetheless. Excellent meal."}
{"text":"Usually not the friendliest customer service but the jerk pork is excellent and prices are very fair"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to meet here. Bad choice. I jut tried this place for the first time... And i want u to keep in mind that i like most restaurants... I have to say this jerk is reallllly bad. I don't reccomend it for a taste food!"}
{"text":"Most Excellent restaurant.  They gave me a student special. $5.99 for Jerk Chicken, a large portion of rice and beans, and steamed vegetables which is cabbage and carrots stewed. The jerk chicken was extremely good, but watch out for the bones! It's my first time trying jamaican food, and this restaurant gave me a great opinion of it. 5 Stars. They don't take debit and credit cards, only cash, but there is an BMO ATM in the Sobey's nearby, CIBC across the street, TD branch in the plaza, and a RBC ATM further down Lawrence Street. A Scotiabank is on the opposite side of the street on Keele,I think."}
{"text":"Amazing food served in large portions for bargain prices. To be clear this is almost exclusively a take-out joint, and a somewhat sad looking one at that, but don't let the appearance fool you. The jerk chicken, rice and cole slaw are finer than you'll find anywhere else in Toronto.  I recommend no gravy or gravy on the side. It's tasty but ultimately masks the delicious jerk flavour."}
{"text":"Great prices and good portions if you wanna quick take out Jamaican meal. The jerk pork is amazing and is accompanied by an amazing sauce."}
{"text":"Jerk Pork (lean) and rice and beans with lots of Ox tail gravy, some pickled onions, with a generous helping of the homemade hot sauce is the way to go! I stop by at least once a week for this!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard jerk place. Nothing too special, but not bad at all. Very decent pricing as well.  Curry goat is deliciously fatty."}
{"text":"I liked this place before. But I ordered a jerk chicken around noon today and it was honestly a really dried-up chicken. Even the chicken drum was extremely hard and dry. I wonder if this is a leftover piece from yesterday. Anyways, I will not be coming back again. Maybe try your luck at dinner time when you know it s from a fresh batch."}
{"text":"Mr. Jerk! I had the pleasure of working next to this little gem and decided to pay a visit around lunch. First off, this is definitely a place where you'd rather grab and go than eat at. The atmosphere is pretty bland and unwelcoming, but who cares? You're only there for the food!   I ordered a beef party which I was told was made fresh (don't know whether or not to believe that) and I got the lunch special which consisted of jerk chicken, rice with gravy and coleslaw.   Everything was on point! The beef inside the patty was so juicy. The jerk chicken was so tender and flavorful, devoured it in seconds. The rice on its own was pretty bland but the gravy which covered the rice made up for it. The coleslaw was delicious. You could definitely tell that it was made with love!   If I'm in the area I'll go back and I do recommend it, but I must add that this is not a place I would travel to get my fix of jerk chicken."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 3 and half stars - it's not quite 4-star material but I feel it's above 3.  Had the jerk chicken for the first time today and it really was quite flavourful, though I could have used more heat on it.  The place itself is a bit of a hole in the wall, but that doesn't really matter for me.  There are a few places to sit, but not tables."}
{"text":"I love love loveeeee this place. It is located near my high school and I've gone here several times over my high school career. I loved ordering anything on their menu really. Also their beef patties are delicious! Especially with coco bread! YUMMMMM. For those in the area looking for a cheap meal and favourful! This is your place.   This place is great for students, they have daily special meals that they offer. But better be quick or else they run out!   - CL"}
{"text":"I grew up eating Mr Jerk from the Peanut Plaza, so when I moved downtown I was relieved to find a location close to home.  You can get Jerk Pork, my personal fave, at Mr. Jerk, something you can't get from Ritz and a lot of other Jerk places.    Their oxtail gravy is great on rice and peas, but I never order the actual oxtail because it seems to be all bones!  I don't know what they do to the patties here, but every time we pick up an order of Jerk, hubby and I always get a patty and by the time we get home wish we had more!  They sell Ting!  Nothing goes better with Jerk in my opinion.  I think they offer delivery, which is good because the parking options are almost non existent.   CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Good Food, Horrible Staff...is it worth it any longer for the calories...NO!  Feb 2014 what a horrible two kids working behind the counter even though they appear old enough to have some manners, Immature...  Very rude individuals. Besides the texting on the phone when i arrived and the second one sweeping the place while some people were eating one of them gave me the wrong order and not until i went to the lot and drove to two corner to eat my food after a long days work did i realize it  was chicken and not jerk pork. I humbly went back in and told the one sweeping as I had already been turned off from the one that served me the food in the first place from her attitude but at the time said nothing. When the one sweeping indicated to the one with the attitude it was the wrong order it was like I had done something wrong. Wayyyyyy to much pride to admit the fault. No sorry, nothing. Telling the one sweeping \"Tell em fe bring it back, bring it back she says to the girl even though I'm standing right there.   I left the food in the car as I did not know if they would take it back. The rude one talks to me like a damn child and i let that go. Then i go get the food and bring it in. She stretches out her hand over the counter after finishing serving a customer without saying a word and i'm just staring at her as I have had enough.  While she is \"stretching out the arm\" I say \"You mean sorry about that sir can you hand me the food\", I say it twice as she looks at me like i'm nuts. Absolutely no training. When she catches on she immediately looks to the one that was sweeping and speaks in Jamaican sucking her teeth and telling the girl in \"Patios\" (Jamaican slang for those who don't know with a sour face) . Are you serious? What a rude girl!  Then the one sweeping starts to take her side because of course their buddies as they work together and don't understand right from wrong. Telling me to hand her the food as im beginning to verbally deal with the rude one....and my problem is with the other girl. Saying this while giving me some serious attitude. Well u know what my second ghetto fabulous employees you now made the problem with me as well because I don't appreciate your vibe. At the end of the day i get my money back and speak to the manager. This Asian man is very apologetic, the two girls are snarling and throwing comments as they over hear my conversation with the Manager, some heroic idiots (Two males) are ordering food and they start sticking their nose in the situation i dont know maybe trying to get an extra chicken wing or look good in front of the girls like its a damn joke. I swear sometimes you really need to check your self as you can get into legal trouble real quick if your not thinking...I believe i made the right choice however when one humbles ones self depending on the outcome u can leave feeling upset, discontented or embarrassed. Who these dudes were i dont know but it all seemed a game to them. Trust me I feel sorry for that Manager because if they are acting like that in front of him then trust me I was more than in the right to get upset because when he was not there they were even worse to me..... Amanda is the name of one, thats what the manager called her when he was telling her to stop with the comments, light skinned red bone, heavy set, pug flat nose and dikey looking...scarf tied on head....second one very dark skinned, shiny skin, innocent looking but not, baseball cap on top of a curly weave that looked like it was sewn into the hat....I'm seriously pissed....and I'm not trying to be mean...  I truly wish I had time and the gull to call out rude businesses/employees with others and make it a mission for others to know.....picket the business if we had to.....  Take care y'all"}
{"text":"Eating the jerk pork dinner as I speak. Came to the place, looks cleaner than the one next door let me tell you that. There were about 5 people inside the store. Since it was my first time j asked the kind British man beside me what he recommends. He says that jerk chicken can be bought anywhere. So try the jerk pork. I complied. Luckily for me they just brought out a batch of fresh pork. The British man said he has been waiting for 30 minutes! I paid 11$ including tax and I kind of wish I got the chicken too. The pork is fine a bit of spice but a little boring.    The reviews you read about customer service is true! There is one older lady there who prepares the food. She's quite rude. No smiles, straight to the point. I am of Filipino decent standing about 5ft tall. When she told the cashier to cash me out she said, \" this one is for the little Ching Ching over there\" the other cashier laughed.  Overall food is average. Come to this place for mediocre food and some slight verbal abuse lol!"}
{"text":"The service here is awful ...the cashier is rude ...there's nowhere to sit ..but the food is good especially the jerk chicken ...and that's the only reason I'd go back it's also pretty expensive compared to sunrise"}
{"text":"Needless to say the only items I have ever ordered at Mr. Jerk are the jerk related ones, and so this review is not relevant to the roti or any other dishes!  The jerk chicken and pork are both very tasty and appropriately spiced! The shop has a good turnover so it's usually a good bet that the food has not been sitting around for too long, especially on school days!  I'm not a jerk expert, so I don't know if this really is the best jerk or not, or whether the jerk sandwich should have any ingredients other than jerk meat and gravy (that's all you'll get here)! I do however wish that they served bread that wasn't basically a square 20c hot dog bun as it is neither the tastiest or healthiest item hugging your jerk meat!  Overall very speedy service and tasty Caribbean style meat!"}
{"text":"What an experience!... seen Mr Jerk on Yelp because I was in the area, and decided give it a shot with my brother  First off,  they only take cash, and I don't carry cash as often as I used to. They told me I had to go to the dollar store and ask for cash back, they had an ATM there and charged me $2.50 which is pretty standard but I didn't want to really spend that $2.50 I could of bought 2 drinks. Went back and ordered a large jerk chicken with rice and peas, the salad is 1 dollar extra if you decide to get it.   They didn't have a place to sit down and eat which I thought we can so we had to bring it home. My brother opened his first and his jerk chicken looked nice!! I opened mine and mine wasn't even jerk chicken it was jerk pork!!! Hahaha I didn't even notice I got the wrong food. The pork was kinda on the dry side, had a piece of the chicken and it was great. Not the best but definitely great.    Would I go back again? Maybe if I was in the area and wanted some food to go I would."}
{"text":"Mr.Jerk!! This Resturant has been around for a long time and still going strong below are my likes and dislikes and my personal rating.  Like: Decent variety of food. My personal favorite is the jerk pork.  Likes: Food quality is is pretty good regardless of what time you go there.  Portion is good as well. Actually when it comes to portion I cannot complain.  Consistency has been the same.  Price: West Indian food is generally pricy but you get a good portion from Mr.jerk.  Customer service - the staff there can be funny.   Dislikes: Sometimes the pork has too much fat. I've only had one negative experience. One time I spent 10.00 on Jerk pork and it felt like 4.00 was just fat. I had throw it out, but that was only one time.  Update: Here's a tip - Don't go there when it's about to close. Food isn't that good at closing time.  Below is the half Jerk chicken meal"}
{"text":"Best jerk pork in the city. The people who work here are so friendly and love to chat. I usually get the small jerk pork dinner with steamed vegetables. The oxtail gravy is great! They're very generous on their servings. The patties have a fluffier crust but still taste great. Can't complain about pricing either. For two patties, a small dinner, and dumpling (extra gravy), came to less than $15. Can't beat that deal for that much food. Will continue going back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First time trying jerk chicken and it doesn't disappoint me! It's totally I hidden gem in the Peanut Plaza. Would never notice it till my friend brought me there.  The jerk chicken Was so juicy and tasty. I ordered Jerk chicken in sandwich and it comes with a free pop ($6.15+tax) and my friend ordered the curry chicken with rice. I tried some of the curry chicken and the chicken was so tender and the gravy was thick too.   Will definitely go again with other friends. However they only serve for take-outs."}
{"text":"This is a kinda grody looking hole in the wall but the food is amazing.  I always get the jerk pork and add some plantain to the order.  I can't begin to count the number of items I've been there and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Being in the area and hearing rave reviews of Mr. Jerk, I walked into a very cramped store.  Ordered the lunch special and was nickel and dimed for forks, plastic bag and I am sure if that guy could of charged for napkins.   I prefer Tastee Bread up the street as they have seating and they include a soda with their specials and do not charge extra (also clean environment)"}
{"text":"3.5/5  This is the location where it all began, apparently. The famous jerk takeout is a hole in the wall and certainly not for everyone. If you can endure waiting a really long time during peak hours inside a cramped space heated to sauna temperatures by steam trays, then you are a real Jerk..fan. The Jerk Chicken lunch special comes with rice and beans, coleslaw and gravy. The gravy is just as important as the chicken and don't you forget it! The blackened chicken is fall of the bone tender and moist like you wouldn't believe. Maybe I'm going deaf, maybe I'm going blind or maybe I'm simply out of my mind but this long-time patron feels like quality of Mr. Jerk is starting to slip just a bit. Even so, where the heck are you gonna curb a mammoth-scale huger with moderately tasty and marginally nutritious food for under a $7 these days?"}
{"text":"Jerk pork is very flavourful, not overly salty, and most importantly not dry.  I've tried the jerk chicken on previous occasions, and found that to be quite dry.  I love the rice and peas that sit underneath the pork, and its topped with some cabbage and carrot slaw.  I'm not sure if gravy is supposed to be that thick, as I've been to other Caribbean restaurants with gravy that isn't nearly as thick.  You just need to get over the small grimey looking interior.  There's no room for you to sit, it's strictly a take out place.  But good enough to satisfy the occasional craving."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Caribbean venue on the East side of town...  The place serves Caribbean and Chinese food. I've never tried the Chinese food but the Caribbean food is pretty good. I usually go for Curry Chicken roti, and from what I've heard their Curry goat is also good.   Prices are around $8 per dish, there is a a very  limited sitting area therefore I recommend a take-out..."}
{"text":"I worked nearby this past summer and almost every meal I had during my break was from here. The owner is super nice and likes to chat when it isn't busy, which is rare - there's usually a line up in there. The jerk chicken dinner is amazing, but if you're not too hungry then the jerk chicken sandwich is also amazing! I've never had jerk anything before but after trying this place, I'm hooked. The patties and dumplings with gravy - oh man, don't even get me started on the gravy, it's great on everything - were my favourites of mine as well."}
{"text":"my fav place for jerk downtown. jerk pork is my recommendation but the oxtail and also curry goat are very good. fried chicken is also banana's good. ive read some lesser reviews and it seems the folks have just done it wrong. i do not think that they do a great jerk chicken (my personal view) but jerk pork which is very unique to Jamaican cuisine (rastafari) and usually only made by chinese-jamaicans. always get the pork with sauce and if youre feeling glutonness ask for a mix of fatty and lean meat to add moisture. coleslaw and their sauteed veggies are good subs for rice if you want go paleo."}
{"text":"My staple for jerk chicken, jerk pork, and patties when I lived in the area and went to the high school nearby. The jerk pork with white rice (and sriracha) is unbelievable. I love the patties here as well because the filling is like a meat gravy. Be careful though, if it's fresh, you'll burn the hell out of your face. I like how you don't need to pull teeth here getting extras like different gravies."}
{"text":"It's alright, but definitely not the best. I was deeply craving a good rice and peas with chicken, and Mr. Jerk did not do it for me. I found the rice and peas a bit watered down. The jerk chicken was ok, some what spicy, but it was only on the surface, not full flavored as I prefer it. The portions were great tho and I really love the coleslaw.  The price, about $9, is great! Not has good as my favorites (Caribbean Bistro at Yonge and Egl, or the delicious Jerk King), but might be back, because it's close by and not a terrible place (again, just ok)."}
{"text":"Other mr jerk spots foods taste much better than here. I think the cooks is messing it up"}
{"text":"Service: It's a small shop with one lady running the cashier and packing your food. Therefore, during lunch time go early if you don't want to wait.  Ambiance: The shop is not exactly located in the best part of town, and the shop is a bit run down, but the food itself makes up for it!  Food: I only tried their jerk chicken, and I promise myself every time that i'll try something different. Yet, I still end up getting the jerk chicken, cause it's just that good. The chicken is so tender that it falls off the bone, paired with that bean rice and gravy is like the perfect match. The portions are huge too. I never feel hungry walking out of the shop. It's really reasonably priced too, at $7 plus taxes it also comes with a drink during lunch hours!"}
{"text":"No wonder this place has the worst rating from the other Mr. Jerk. I love their jerk pork and chicken but the staff fits the name of the establishment, jerk. Order 1lb pork and 1lb chicken and when I was putting my hot sauce in, the dude working there tells me \"to leave some for the other customers\" I tell him I just ordered 2 pounds of meat so I obviously need more sauce. I also told him to get some more from the back kitchen, he said he doesn't have any more. Well... that's too bad for him. They never keep a full bottle of hot sauce there. SUPER TIGHT!!! Will not support these guys although I like the flavour of their food.  Another time I went there and got a lb of pork and the food was COLD. I didn't notice when he gave it to me because I took it home but I had to put the food in the oven. I QUIT. NEVER will I support this place again. Done!!!"}
{"text":"good food ...HORRENDOUS SERVICE!  We put in an order (with $100 down payment) a week in advance to cater for 25 people for our sons baptism.  We had asked for the food for 1130am, but were told they dont open until 12pm noon, so that's the earliest they could provide the food. No problem!  Come the day of the event, my husband went there at 12pm, to find them JUST turning on the lights.  The lady at the cash told us there was no order... after some back and forth and blaming between her and someone in the back, they finally asked us to give us 20 min.  STILL we were ok with it, we needed to feed our guests after all.  Then we were told, \"but the bake will be about 40 min\" - by that time our lunch would almost be over!  We were so upset, and all t hey said they would do is give us 2 extra bake.  wow, thank you!  We used to be regulars here.  Between us and our guests who we explained everything to, we will NEVER order from here again and neither will our guests.  There are so many good jerk spots around toronto that we dont need to support a business with literally ZERO customer service."}
{"text":"Most amazing jerk chicken, I've been going here for over 20 years, the staff have been the same \"Just Plain Rude, No Smiles\" but the food is truly the best. They unfortunately know there food is very good, as anytime in the day there are long lineups, and they serve everyone with a grouchy smile."}
