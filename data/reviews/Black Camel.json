{"text":"Black camel is pure awesome. It's small, inexpensive and packs a crazy punch. I highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich with barbecue sauce  and a brio. It's quick, great and convenient if you're getting off the Rose-dale subway. The black camel is THE SANDWICH PLACE."}
{"text":"Cozy little spot just across from the Rosedale Subway Station and one of the best Slow Cooked Beef Brisket Sandwiches I have had...anywhere... Service is fast and efficient, and the sandwich comes dripping wet with your choice of great  condiments...I am a big condiment fan, so I suggest the Basil Mayo Pesto, and Horseradish, topped with sautee'd mushrooms and cheese if you want to get decadent...comes on a good sized Kaiser and plenty of Beef...it's almost tough to finish the whole thing...almost...."}
{"text":"Toronto seriously lacks good sandwich shops, and this one is a rare gem. Fantastic sandwiches, from the amazingly soft and fresh buns, to the tender and flavorful meats, to the interesting and zesty toppings. A must try!  Only suggestion: more seating would be nice, but that's only a concern in the winter. In summer, go and eat in the park across Yonge St."}
{"text":"Amaze-balls!  Had the beef brisket with caramelized onions and BBQ sauce - seems like the go-to for newbies. My boyfriend wanted the pulled pork but they were sold-out so he asked the guy at the counter to choose for him. Unfortunately I was too distracted with mine to remember what he got - but it was good too!  Decent price for a quick lunch or light dinner."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork with dijon and bbq sauce, it was pretty decent. Next time I will try the beef brisket with the chipotle sauce. The place was busy, it seems good enough to try again!"}
{"text":"Top-notch sandwiches that are great to take out and eat at the nearby park. The beef brisket is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place isn't run by men...it's run by Gods lol! Honestly every time someone even mentions \"Black Camel\" in the office everyone's eyes light up & it's a matter of finding two people to make the run - which is never hard considering you get to eat Black Camel.. 3 words describe this place best....\"Om nom nom!\""}
{"text":"Easily one of the best sandwiches I've had in Toronto! Also a really convenient spot for those hitting up the Toronto Reference Library...  Came here on a Friday evening and enjoyed 2 sandwiches in the park right across the street.  We had the slow roasted beef brisket sandwich with black camel BBQ sauce and caramelized onions. The beef brisket was super tender and juicy (but not messy). The other sandwich we had was a special BLT sandwich with pancetta. Amazingly light yet extremely delicious. The only downside to this sandwich is it is a bit salty.  Can't wait to come back to try their pulled pork sandwich!"}
{"text":"I was so incredibliy impressed with this place for a few reasons.  I was there during the week, at off-peak hours, so the atmosphere at that time was nice and relaxed.  I was able to strike up a conversation with the girl at the cash, and she was incredible inviting and friendly.  I had heard that the BBQ was what I should order here, but according to her, it's the brisket that is what brigns people back. HINT HINT : Staff Advice is great!  Follow it!  So I order the brisket and it was amazing.  I got it with BBQ sauce on it, as well as carmelized onions.  I'm not able to eat bread... .no problem!  they offered it to me in a cup with a fork to eat.  Awesome!  Just based on being there for the one dish, I will defiinitely go back, not only to try other things, but also the same thing (brisket) with different combos of accompanyments, such as BBQ sauce, mustardds, onions, sauces, etc."}
{"text":"Food here is great, love the sandwiches. The service is quick and the place is neat. Super close to the subways station so it's at a convenient location for me. I don't go there often because I think $10 for a sandwich, no side, is a little out of my budget but I like to treat myself to a delicious beef brisket sandwich once and a while."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches in the city.  The brisket with bbq sauce and fried onions is all I need in life. Sometimes they even have home made butter tarts too."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows I love sandwiches, lunch and dinner. So when I saw this place I knew I just HAD to try it! Last week I came and to my surprise, it's this tiny little place that smells heavenly. The cashier greeted us and explained what comes with the sandwich. I got the pulled chicken with chipotle mayo and their BBQ sauce, my partner got the beef brisket with the Basil pesto and the hummus. We asked for the sauces on the side as we weren't feeling that adventurous. The gentleman soon came outside with our orders. I took a bite of the chicken without sauce and OMG..it was heaven. The fact that they could use white meat and have it that moist, I'll give it to them. I began spreading the chipotle and BBQ and after a while I was just dunking it in the sauces. Sadly, it ended too soon. My partners beef brisket? just as amazing...the beef was so tender and filled with flavour without the sauces. The Basil pesto and hummus, weren't our favourites, but that's fine.   Will I be back? Hell yeah. This Saturday!"}
{"text":"Love the multitude of options you can get on the many sandwiches.  Great place to sit outside during the summer months.   A little on the pricey side for my wallet to handle on a regular basis but always good for a treat."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was ok Asked if smoked was told yes it is slow cooked - not the same thing! Sauce a bit sweet Would go back if in the area but would not make a special trip"}
{"text":"Beef Brisket, W/BBQ Sauce, Coleslaw.  Best sandwich I've ever had.  If you order anything else I will find you, and wave my finger at you disapprovingly.  I don't know if it's the buns, the ingredients, or the fact that I always go here for hangover lunch, but nothing compares.    it usually comes in around $14 for a single sandwich and can of soda."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches as all have said. Best option is buy and go, as there is no space in the restaurant to eat. 10 people and it is packed. Agree that they need to look at a more efficient system to order.. collect sandwich.. and out the door. Sandwich itself very good and the extras to compliment the sandwich are excellent. Excellent sandwich... but exit the place to enjoy it."}
{"text":"My first thought upon seeing the sign outside \"this unassuming little place is supposed to have spectacular sandwiches???\" Walking in I was still skeptical. The whole places was made up of a  long counter with a man taking the orders, (maybe) 8 places to sit inside and a tiny kitchen with one guy making sandwiches.   I lined up with my boyfriend, when our turn came I decided to go with the daily special: pancetta, arugula and pesto mayo. The boyfriend made his own flavour combo: pulled chicken, caramelized onions and chipotle mayo.   It was love at first bite. The freshness of the bread,the combination of the flavours and textures was phenomenal. My boyfriend's sandwich was just as delicious. We were both very pleased with our choices.   Will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich shop. I would usually get the beef brisket sandwich with caramelized onions, bbq and chipotle mayo sauces.  It's probably best to enjoy in the summer / early fall as you can get the sandwich to go and eat it in the nearby park.  The prices are reasonable also. This shop offers coffee/espresso drinks but I haven't tried them so can't comment on the quality."}
{"text":"Another review, another five stars. But few people would disagree on Black Camel's five-star worthiness. This tiny sandwich shop/café located across from Rosedale station is the definitive culinary gem of Rosedale.   Despite having lived in the area for over three years, I only managed to discover this eatery a couple months back. Its nondescript appearance, and off-Yonge location led me to believe it was some sort of independent furniture store (hey, it is the area for that after all!).   One day, I noticed a massive lineup outside Black Camel around noon. Surely this was no furniture store. I had to investigate. It turned out that the lineup was a regular occurrence, as locals and employees in the area alike had turned Black Camel into their lunchtime spot of choice.  At lunch hour, this is truly a take-out joint. There are a couple bar stools along the front window, and two two-seater tables, but the chances of snagging one of these seats at lunch for yourself and a friend or two are slim to none. In the early evening, it is more than possible.   The menu is simple. A series of four or five sandwiches, plus a daily special (usually BLT) for $7. Some desserts (buttertarts are a must) and your regular selection of drinks. The holy trifecta for me? Slow roasted pulled pork, beef brisket, or shredded chicken. It's always a dilemma in choosing, for all three are the key ingredients in creating the best sandwiches in the city. All are fresh, juicy, and loaded with flavour, generously heaped onto a fresh bun. You can add two sauces at no extra cost (basil pesto mayo and the Moroccan-spice infused charamoula mayo, amazing). There are also additional toppings such as chili-roasted red onions (a must) and fontina cheese (does not work well with any of the sandwiches) for a mere 0.90 cents each.   And there you have it. A hulking, fresh, filling sandwich for under $10.   Despite the lineups and small space, the 3-4 staff on hand have this down to a T. They remember your name, they know your order, no matter how complex, without asking you to repeat, and their counter-to-kitchen motions are seamless. This allows you to have your meal within 5 minutes of entering, though surely you will not be the only patron.   If there is one place to eat in Rosedale, it is Black Camel. Among the Terronis and Quanto Bastas of Rosedale, it's a simple little sandwich shop that wins my heart, and importantly, my taste buds and stomach. Allow it to win yours too."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sandwiches in town! You will always be satisfied. You have to try the beef brisket with onions, mushrooms, bbq saucr and chipotle."}
{"text":"This is a small place that serves either the beef brisket or pulled pork sandwich. Not many options, but they do it really really well. They have a few other items on their menu, but why would anyone want to get anything else besides their two amazingly famous options?   One word of warning: There are only two tables. Be prepared to eat your sandwich standing. But that's part of the charm of a tiny place like this :)  One of the best sandwich places in Toronto. I hope they continue to do well."}
{"text":"Located just across the street from Rosedale subway station, the aroma from the brisket and pork always tempts me to pick up a sandwich. It was just a matter of time before I gave in...  It's a really small sandwich joint, so it seems most people just grab the sandwiches to go. The way it works here is that you order one of their basic sandwiches (beef brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken, steak, a veggie option) for $7.00. Each of their sandwiches come with a choice of one sauce. You can add extra sauce or toppings for $0.90 each.  I opted for the beef brisket sandwich with the Black Camel BBQ sauce and added an additional sauce and topping - the chipotle mayo and caramelized onions. What a fantastic combination. The BBQ sauce was primarily sweet with a bit of a tang to it, and the brisket just melted in my mouth.   My boyfriend went with the pulled BBQ pork shoulder sandwich with the BBQ sauce and coleslaw. Similar to the brisket sandwich, the meat was ridiculously tender. The coleslaw added a nice crunch to it. Even though this was a pretty solid sandwich, we both actually preferred the brisket.  Sure, the sandwiches are a bit on the pricier side (around $10 with the extra toppings), but they are really large, filling and delicious!"}
{"text":"Black camel's sandwiches are the absolute best! Highest caliber pulled meat in downtown Toronto, and their bread is always freshly baked and delicious. My go-to is pulled chicken with basil pesto mayo and roasted red peppers. Sooo good."}
{"text":"Great gem in the heart of midtown! Found this great place off Yelp while stroking around Rosedale area with gf.    The interior was pleasantly clean for a street restaurant; the cashier was super friendly and knowledgeable about their food selection, and what a selection that is!  I had the beef brisket and my gf had the pulled pork, both arrived on a timely manner.  The sauce selection was superb as well, and the variety of toppings gave the sandwich a gourmet feel.  The portion was just right and with 2 drinks it came to about $20, not too bad for a downtown restaurant.    The place is well deserving for its excellent reviews, highly recommend to check out should you be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"After an hour and a half trying and rejecting then buying shoes at MEC, not only did I walk out with 2 pairs of boots, plus a pair of walking shoes...I also had a killer craving for the BEST and I mean the BEST beef sandwich in T.O.  So, thank goodness for Google, because it led me to Black Camel - and great reviews on Yelp!.  And boy, their beef brisket sandwich just grabbed me by the taste buds and dropped kicked me into sandwich nirvana.  Luckly for me, I got there on a lazy Sunday afternoon, so the restaurant didn't have a long line up and they had plenty of beef brisket.  Ordered 2 sandwiches to share (1/2 and 1/2).  One was beef with the basil pesto mayo, dijon mustard and roasted sweet red peppers.  The other was beef brisket with charamoula mayo (they say it's moroccan), dijon mustard and chili roasted red onions.  I was salivating the moment I walked in the door and inhaled the meaty aromas in the cozy restaurant.  Glad it was empty, since it can get pretty crowded.  I loved it.  Several regulars walked in for takeout while I waited for my food and while I was groaning in gastronomic ecstasy.  Juices from the beef and sauces perpetually tried to escape and dribble down my chin.  Brisket kept dropping on the foil wrapper since the bun was stuffed so that it was bursting from the sides.  The sauces tantalized and seduced my taste buds and danced happily down my gullet.  I could've ordered another sandwich, but wisely decided to postpone this sandwich seduction to another day.  Oh yes, I'll be back, Black Camel.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"A very small restaurant at Yonge/Crescent.  I went there during lunch time, tried the famous \"beef brisket\" sandwich with Onion and BBQ sauce. The burger cost $7.5 plus tax.  Pros: very delicious - the beef is very tasteful and the bbq sauce just add to it  Cons: it might because i didn't add enough tops, but in my burger, there is only meat and 2 pieces of onion. If there could be a choice of beef + vege(either as top or salad), I think it would be a more balanced meal."}
{"text":"To my disappointment, something has changed at Black Camel to its detriment in my eyes. The brisket is not as juicy and saucy anymore as it used to be :( They also implemented a stupid take out policy, which I dislike."}
{"text":"Oh my god... I would drive through a pack of cute, doddering grandmothers for a Black Camel sandwich!  It's that good... It's no less than the greatest meat-delivery system I can imagine.  It might even be better than Bakesale Betty's, though the Camel has no analogue. Apples and oranges.  Having seen it's stellar reviews and realizing that it was less than a subway stop away, I walked down for lunch.  I got the \"impossibly tender\" beef brisket with bbq, chipotle mayo and caramelized onions.  I don't know how it was for the sandwich, but I'm pretty sure I came first!   The shop is small but clean, and they have lots of desserts and canned beverages there.  You might be lucky enough to snag a table, but it's really a take-out joint.  I have to go back and try the pulled pork and the seared cold steak sandwiches.  There is simply no other sandwich that can top the ecstasy of the Black Camel, you have to go there asap."}
{"text":"This place definitely isn't designed for vegetarians but they make a great veggie sandwich with roasted tomatoes, eggplant, zucchni.  I recommend ordering extra toppings to fill up the bun - it's a bit skimpy otherwise. Great with hummus and a side of coleslaw."}
{"text":"One of the top 5 things I've ever eaten in my life. I had the beef..and it was amazing..I talk about it all the time and spot by everytime I am in Toronto. Sooooo good, from a nice small spot."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork sandwich. The whole thing is so soft and tender, melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. The staff makes you feel at home - they are warm and happy to converse.   Best beef brisket that I've ever had. Period."}
{"text":"Most of the other reviews will mirror mine: you'll be hard pressed to find a better sandwich in Toronto.  Pulled pork is my favourite."}
{"text":"My coworker was weaving through Toronto traffic on a Thursday afternoon, violating numerous traffic laws with a series of u-turns and illegal left turns. We had just come from a meeting in the downtown core when I was prompted to ask, \"Why not just take Avenue Road to go north to Yonge and Eg\"   \"Because then we will be out of the way from the Black Camel!\" was the emphatic response I received.   So then I had to ask, \"What the hell is the Black Camel?\"  The Black Camel, as it turned out, is a small sandwich shop directly across from Rosedale subway station that serves the best slow roasted beef brisket sandwich that I've tried in the city. It's easy to miss since the signage is just a Black Camel (what else?) and it really is tiny. There's enough room to form a single-file line that's maybe eight people deep. Once you order, you wait outside. There are some seats for loners, since you can't really have a group of more than two eating at the same time. I can't imagine where people eat in the winter. Maybe they take the sandwiches to go.   The sandwich is just the right size. You don't feel incredibly full, but you're definitely satisfied. The bread is fresh and the flavours are balanced. I would've had two if I didn't have to go back to my desk and be productive.   There's no parking available here. Curiously, you can't park on the street directly in front of it even though it's wide as hell. Some poor customer jumped in his car and sped off as a traffic cop came around with her yellow roll of tickets. He came back just in time for his order to be done. We played it smart by having our junior guy sit in the car with the blinkers on and the engine running.   If you love pulled pork sandwiches, you HAVE to try this place. Just take the subway."}
{"text":"Really great beef brisket sandwich. It's a pity this place is so far away from me. Definitely worth the $10.    Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So far we've tried the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches. They're pretty good. I would prefer the bun to be crispy. As it is, it requires a bite and pull to tear off a piece. Its not out of this world delicious but whenever we can't decide on what to eat, this is always a solid choice and not too expensive for the city."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here tasted pretty good... But they were not worth the gut rot and explosive bathroom situation shortly after eating them.  Thanks.. But no thanks."}
{"text":"Came here after reading good reviews while I was working in the area. Customer service was polite and efficient. Menu was clean and simple. Sandwich was excellent. Have been here twice and would come back here anytime I get the chance."}
{"text":"Loved the food, quick service, kind and welcoming employees, and had a great experience all around. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, will be here again! Next time, I'll ask for extra sauce on my brisket - that's the only thing I would change."}
{"text":"Oh ya! Great sandwiches and great options.    Pick the protein then choice from lots of excellent high end sauces and add ons.  Maybe the best sandwich in the city."}
{"text":"Awesome brisket and pulled pork sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Black Camel lived up to the hype. Had a fantastic beef brisket sandwich with caramelized onions, BBQ sauce and fontina cheese and it was spectacular. One of the best I've ever had. Limited seating and more a takeout place than a sitdown. I will be returning and strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I heard of Black Camel via Now's 'Best Burger in the City' article. I think. Either way, I came here ... TWICE. I did not want to give a verdict until I gave it a fair chance.  The first time around, I had the pulled pork sandwich with BBQ sauce / caramelized onions. My gut impression was 'WTH? What is the fuss? The lunatics ... such blasphemy!'. Ok, maybe that reaction was slightly on the strong side. But I take my food seriously and I just did NOT like it AT ALL. I found the pork stringy and porky.  The latter means that I could taste pig and nothing much else ... I just couldn't find the cohesion between the pork / sauce / onions. Perhaps it was because I came fairly late in the afternoon ... and (maybe) the pork was left on the warmer for too long. I am not sure what it was. I just couldn't get into it. I have had smokey bbq food before where the sauce just made you want to lick your fingers and / or  the pork simply melted into your mouth. This sandwich did neither.  However, I was not deterred. I rarely give a verdict after only one try. So, I decided to return for the beef brisket the second time around. This time, I had the following toppings: chipotle mayo / horse radish / sautéed mushrooms. Boy, was I glad I did not give up so easily. The combination was superb IMHO. I needed the extra tangy zing from the horse radish. It just pulled everything together without being too overpowering (some horse radishes are just too strong for me). And the mushrooms were melty smooth and chewy. The bun was firm yet moist. The highlight was the brisket: it was smoky, tasty, and tender. I devoured the whole sandwich in mere minutes. And I promptly went up to the counter to get my loyalty card: god darn it, I will be coming back again ... and again ... and again. THIS ONE IS DELISH! Jackpot!!!!   BTW, the service was impeccable. My only recommendation is taking the sandwich out to the nearby park as there are only a handful of chairs in there."}
{"text":"The place in itself is very small but sure holds its ground to compete against a lot of brisket and pulled pork sandwich shops. Coming from a city that is know for its meats and sandwiches this was a awesome place to get some last  minute lunch. My cousins (who i was visiting in Toronto) works close to here and was convenient. I ordered the Beef brisket and he ordered the chicken brisket. Both were scrumptious but i wish i would have also gotten the chicken. It was perfectly marinated and the sauces compliment the meal. I would highly recommend this place. Also, the staff is super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Wandered by this place today and recognized it from Yelp as a good place to go.  Not sure I would have stopped in otherwise as from the outside it doesn't look like much.  Even on the inside it doesn't have any telltale signs you can get some amazing sandwiches here.  The coffee paraphernalia makes it seem more like a coffee shop then a sandwich shop.  All that aside, we ordered the beef brisket based on the YELP reviews.  Otherwise probably would have opted for the pulled pork.  Service is extremely fast.  Like, really fast.  On top of fast service the sandwich was really really good.  I can't wait to go back and the other things."}
{"text":"Below is my rating definition.  * = Don't even bother going ** = Nothing out of the ordinary *** = Pretty good stuff **** = Outstanding ***** = It's basically 4 stars but they do it consistently  This review is for their beef brisket sandwich.  Made a visit yesterday after hearing all the rave reviews about their sandwich. I love my sandwich and every time I hear a good beef brisket or pulled pork sandwich, I'm there.  Anyhow, I would give this 1.5 stars, but since there's no half star, I would round it up to 2 stars.  The good:  This place has all the hidden gem ingredients: small boutique-liked, obscure location and long line up.   The bad: First of all, warm meat on cold bread is a big turn off. It's like putting hot tomato sauce on a bed of cold pasta. Meat is tender but lack in taste. For all you southern BBQ enthusiasts, the beef doesn't come in sliced form, rather it's completely shredded. Not the southern tradition, but it's okay since we aren't in the south. Their home-made BBQ sauce is acceptable but is nothing to brag about.  Overall it's a disappointing sandwich. For the same price, I would head down to Lou Dawg instead."}
{"text":"Perfect location just next to rosedale subway.  Ordered pulled pork with bbq sauce. It came in huge portion. And since I didn't add any other topping, it was just meat and bread. The meat is kind of dry. I felt a little dizzy after eating all the pork. The sauce and bread are perfect. The bread is chewy. Love it a lot"}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious! I've tried their both their Pulled BBQ Pork sandwich and their Roasted Roma Tomato, Sweet Red Pepper, Arugula & Eggplant sandwich (both with the basil mayo) and they hit the spot. Always very fresh, very savory, and very filling. The staff are nice and the service is relatively fast - just watch out, because they get busy quick during lunch and it's a very small space. (Pro tip: In the summer, order your sandwich and drink to go and eat it in Rosedale Park across the street! Bonus points if you bring a blanket!)"}
{"text":"I had the roast beef brisket, and it didn't quite hit the spot as i had expected, i read all the reviews on yelp and went in with a lot of expectations, especially on the taste, but it turns out to be just another greasy burger.   Secondly, with regards to my recommendation, if or not you should go to this place, well, it drills down to a matter of choice, if you are that someone who watches your diet and nutrition, then this may not be a place which is up your alley;  however If you are OK to eat some grease once in a while, i would say go for it ... its not that bad to rule it all completely."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place ! So worth the money you pay ! Great food and service ! Highly recommend it !"}
{"text":"Excellent burger style \"sandwich\". The sauce are amazing and the bun is nice & chewy. Make sure you follow their Twitter account as they close the shop when sold out."}
{"text":"Really delicious....really cheap. I prefer the Chicken and the Pulled pork, but that's just me...not really a read meat eater."}
{"text":"Let's just get right down to it. This place does it simple and does it well. I chose to go with the infamous 5-day marinated beef brisket along with their pulled pork (because I cannot resist a good pulled pork sandwich).  Their selection of toppings all looked delicious but I decided to stick to the basics. I put some caramelized onions and barbecue sauce on those suckers and popped em in my mouth asap.  As soon as I took that first bite into that delicious beef brisket, I was mesmerized by how tender and juicy it was. This was definitely due to their 5-day process for making this (I swear I'm not getting paid to repeat this), and this was definitely why everyone always recommends this specific sandwich. The pulled pork sandwich on the other hand, was much more bland and didn't seem to \"pull\" me into flavour heaven after tasting the beef brisket. I guess there's a reason why everyone prefers the beef brisket after all."}
{"text":"I still dream about the beef brisket sandwich with caramelized onions, the BC sauce, and mushrooms. OMG honestly... It is probably the best sandwich I've ever had. So moist and juicy (and messy)!! All signs of an amazing sandwich, amirite?"}
{"text":"Really basic sandwiches and a limited menu, but they make what they have extremely well. I had a beef brisket sandwich, but also tried a bite of a pulled pork sandwich, both were amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place! I used to walk by it everyday on the way to the Rosedale subway. You could smell the meat and onions cooking every morning. I'm partial to the beef brisket, but the pulled pork is good too. The staff have always been friendly, even though they've been rammed every time I've been there."}
{"text":"Oh, man. I don't even eat pulled pork - I had the vegetable sandwich. As a package it was good, but not great. Leave the greatness to the slow-cooked meats. I will never know and can never comment.   ALL I KNOW IS THAT THE BUN WAS HEAVEN. Heeeeaaaaveeeennnn. It was like floating on a marshmallow cloud that got punched in the face with gluten. It was like wrapping yourself up in an alpaca duvet and then slow-motion falling into a vat of white bunnies.  You can order a plain bun. You can get one with jam. If you can tear yourself away from the prok (purposeful misspelling), get a jam bun. Or take one home. Or just steal all their buns.   I'll stop talking."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to swing by and grab a sammich for a long time, having heard so many fantastic things about the small sandwich place next to Rosedale Station. Today was that lucky day.  I kept it simple and grabbed two sandwiches: a beef brisket with BBQ sauce and caramelized onions for the hubs, and a pulled pork with same toppings for myself. I always find it best to keep it simple when trying a place out for the first time. If you can't do the basics right, don't even think of trying something more complex.  The staff was super nice and the prices are definitely reasonable, especially considering the neighbourhood. The man working behind the counter was unexpectedly apologetic, making me wait a whole of an extra minute while he processed another woman's order. Maybe the poor guy has to deal with some seriously impatient and entitled individuals having to work in fancy-pants-land.  Upon receiving my takeout bag (within minutes of ordering), I remarked at how heavy it was. I quickly cycled home so we could mow down before things got too soggy. I opened the paper and couldn't believe how heavy the thing was. I opened the sandwich to what was an amazing amount of delicious meat. My sandwich was juicy and delicious! My only mistake was waiting to eat it. I can't wait to go back and try another."}
{"text":"I tried the pulled pork sandwich. The pulled pork sandwich I remember from Texas was juicy and tender. This pulled pork sandwich is on the dry side. Where did the pork fat go???!!!??? And not enough sauce. Bun wasn't warmed up. My search of a succulent pulled pork in Toronto continues.  2 stars for texture 1 star for pork fat 3 stars for flavor 4 stars for the people's smile in the shop"}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich with hummus and bbq sauce.  Pros: Good sandwich, good amount of meat, fast service and cost.   Cons: Pulled pork was a little dry, large bun (which isn't terrible).   Cost for lunch is average at 8-10 dollars a sandwich.   Again? For sure, but I would try another meat and definitely add toppings to the sandwich."}
{"text":"The best sandwich I've ever had! I get the pulled beef with chermoula mayo and am in heaven! The place is small and a little cramped (because it's always busy) but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Super tiny place and had one thing on the menu for vegetarians. I have definitely had a better roasted veggie sandwich before for half the price i payed here. Not going back"}
{"text":"Great tasting burger for a decent price. I wouldn't say the burger blew me away, but it was filling and tasty in its own right. I would definitely recommend adding several toppings, since the burger can lack flavour on its own. That being said, though, the meat stands its own and you can tell its very well made.   Also beware that its a small place and lines can go out the door. It's best to call in advance and have them make your order ready for you when you arrive. There are also very few places to sit inside so you should be prepared to eat this as a take-out meal."}
{"text":"Hot damn, this is one badass beef brisket sandwich. Enjoy the juicy (and definitely not dry) meaty sandwich with your choice of sauces, and top off with an additional gourmet topping for a wee bit extra change. I mean, really, how can you say no to roasted eggplant atop your sandwich?  Sandwiches sell out as the afternoon progresses, so get there early, or for a wave of the future, follow them on Twitter as they update the \"status\" of their sandwich stock in realtime. It's perfect for a sunny day up in Rosedale where you can enjoy your lunch on one of the few tables they have setup outside the joint itself, or take it over to the nearby park to enjoy (if you can resist scarfing it before getting there)."}
{"text":"A very straightforward and delicious sandwich shop that newcomers and regulars can both enjoy.   Good:  -Very affordable -Short wait time, quick line -Friendly service -Good selection of simple ingredients at their best -Very flavourful cuts of meat, seasoning is spot on -Basil pesto mayo is excellent  Mediocre -Meat can be a tad dry in the center - BBQ sauce tastes phenomenal but has a very liquid consistency  Would definitely return to try more items, highly recommended for anyone Who wants a great sandwich."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  A friend introduced me to this place and I've been obsessed ever since.  A truly wonderful experience.  I also like that you can follow them on twitter and if they're running low on buns, they will tweet and let you know so you don't make the trip and end up disappointed.  Best coleslaw I've ever eaten!  And pair it with the best pulled pork sandwich?  Heaven!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  The staff are extremely freindly.  They know many clients by name.  I always have the chicken rotisserie sandwich with bbq sauce.  I tried the beef briskette as well this time...just to try.  It was very tasty.  The person at the counter said it was the most popular item on the menu but I must say I am still a chicken fan.  I am always in this area and I never knew of this place until this past summer when I was at the park close by and was looking for a nearby place to get a nice cold drink.  I guess I found this place by accident.  It's not a cheap sandwich but it is a qaulity sandwich.  Sandwiches are about $8 after taxes.  If you are ever in the area definitely visit my friends at Camel!"}
{"text":"After being persisitent with my husband to try this place out for about a mth ,cause of the reviews.I finally did today.Dissapointed would be gross understatement.We both had the steak sandwich.Did not mind at all that the steak was rare or that it was a cold sanwhich....but there was absolutely no flavour to the sauce...the bread was like reheating day old bread in the microwave(tough and rubbery,if that's even possible.I'm so mad that i spent my money here .Never again..so annoyed!"}
{"text":"It's a small sandwich menu, but you can create different ways to have that sandwich.   All I can say they are great sandwiches, quality meat used and a perfect bun to hold and absorb all that goodness.   Best to take out for this joint cause the place is a little small."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I can and eat in Ramsden park, across the street. My favourite (this year, at least) is the beef brisket with horseradish mayo- delicious! I went several times in the summer and then just a few days ago, because the weather has been warm, and it seems as though the sandwiches got even larger? Only warning is wasps on the small patio and in the park..."}
{"text":"Still one of the best sandwiches in Toronto. Be prepared to wait on the weekend with lots of kids from Rosedale standing around like goofs waiting for a meal. Eggspresso in the AM is a real beauty."}
{"text":"Service was great but sandwiches were awful. The pulled chicken was grey, cold and rubbery. The bun wasn't even warm! The beef brisket was cold and sauce was too sweet. Severely disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here based on others' ravings. Possibly best BBQ sandwich north of Mason-Dixon Line.  If you like slow cooked meat: GO!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here four or five times and have only ever tried the beef brisket sandwich with horseradish. It is that damn good. The brisket is tender and juicy and the horseradish adds a nice kick.   My one suggestion - eat the sandwich in the store or nearby as they don't travel too well."}
{"text":"It's not exactly a Subway Sandwich they serve up at this local gem, located all-too-temptingly close to the Yonge line's Rosedale station.  If I have my appetite with me I can't pass by without popping in for a dose of roast beef, creamy horseradish and sautéed mushrooms (my personal fave).  Don't expect six kinds of bread or a virtual salad bar waiting to be strewn atop your lengthy loaf.  There's one kind of bun, and nary a morsel of rabbit-food in sight.  But that doesn't mean you won't be spoiled for choice - there are lots of meat, sauce and topping options.  Do expect a monster of a sandwich, with enough meat to leave anyone satisfied.  Best to put something under the sandwich as you eat - you'd be saddened to see even the smallest scrap escape your salivating hatch, but the sandwich is sufficiently stuffed that something's bound to fall out of even this oversized, fresh-baked bun."}
{"text":"Holy fucking shit is this place good. Their beef brisket sandwich is to die for, honestly the best I've ever had. I've never been disappointing with this place, and every person I've taken with me always end up coming back. I find myself getting a sandwich every time I drive by. Staff are friendly, service is extremely quick. There's no where to sit, and Toronto Parking Authority always walk by to ticket people parked on the street. Those are the only bad points. Definitely one of the best places in the city. Get the Beef Brisket with cremini mushrooms and chipotle mayo."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm! This is as gourmet as it gets when it comes to sammys. Went in and told the guy to make me his favourite and it was delish. Expensive for a sandwich but well worth it."}
{"text":"Love this little place! Consistently delicious sandwiches. I usually go for the pulled chicken with charamoula mayo, arugula, and  tomato. The beef brisket is also yummy. Friendly staff, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This little take-out sandwich shop is located just off of Yonge Street, right by Rosedale TTC station. It is kind of a narrow and deep space where you line up to place your order at the cash. The menu is posted on boards on the wall so you can formulate your order on the way.  My regular is the beef brisket sandwich, with mushrooms, house bbq, and horseradish. I have had the pulled pork and while it's also delicious, there is something about the brisket that just wins, y'know?  They have an assortment of canned drinks in a display fridge (including S. Pellegrino limonata and blood orange flavours!) on the opposite wall; but since I live so close that I usually just bring my own water or wine (incognito in a travel mug) to have in the  adjacent park (Ramsden Park) along with my sandwich... and sometimes there is a bocce set involved in that equation (maybe the Black Camel should start a league?)  The cole slaw is of the vinaigrette style (sorry mayonnaise fans). It was nice to have a little acidic punch to take a break from the sandwich. Kinda like having a pickle on the side.  Oh yeah, they have other stuff too; but basically you're either getting pulled pork or brisket.  Also they have a twitter feed to inform you when they are low on buns, because if they run out of buns they close.... I know it says open until 8pm; but I'd check first."}
{"text":"Black Camel is easily one of the greatest hidden gems in Toronto. I was not prepared for the amount of mouth watering flavour that was going to hit my taste buds. Their sandwiches... Are heavenly. It's that simple.. I could try to go into detail in regards to what makes them so delicious... But all I really want to say is, TRY THIS PLACE ASAP! it is rare that I find an establishment that I fantasies about trying again, but this one has done that too me. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but it was fantastic and I have been craving it ever since. Except a line up for lunch, but it moves pretty quickly.   I tried their beef brisket with caramelized onions and BBQ sauce. It was a great combination. The bun was extremely soft, fluffy and fresh. There was a good amount of meat served on the sandwich as well. I took it to go, but next time I'll eat across in the park because by the time I got home, part of the bun got a bit soggy. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"On a crazy hot day, you wouldn't think a beef brisket sandwich would be just what the doctor ordered. But it was! And it was what I ordered at Black Camel too.   For those looking for a winning combo I found the brisket with caramelized onions and chipotle mayo to be amazing. The bun (which many may overlook) holds together well, soaks up the juices and has a nice bite to it. The brisket was SO tender. The onions and chipotle mayo were well and generously distributed. Ask for them to cut it in half so you can get to the inner juiciness right away!   I liked the way the service worked and found it to be very quick! I had the opportunity to snag a tiny marble table (very cooling on a hot day) and rest my feet until I was called by name and delivered the sandwich. Can't wait to try more sandwiches every which way!"}
{"text":"Good sandwich does not feel assembly line made like Subway which is a last resort after being diagnosed with Anemia. The prices are bit high but given the crowd who lives around, negligeable issue. the only thing that was odd was the owner at the till. He is extravagent, weird and treats people in a funny way sometimes. Camp as a Christmas tree and that adds to the flavour I guess. Go early as does not have much left after peak lunch time."}
{"text":"We went to black camel over the summer after reading a lot of good reviews. We ordered the beef brisket and the pulled pork. The sandwiches were good, but I didn't find it anything that particularly special. The person working at the counter was not very friendly when we asked for suggestions, and rushed us along even though there was no line. Overall, it is okay -- if i'm in the neighbourhood and am hungry, I would eat here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way just for it."}
{"text":"Black Camel is one of my favourite places in Toronto!  Their beef brisket with caramelised onions, homemade BBQ sauce and chipotle mayo is a classic but I love their pork and chicken sandwiches just as much.  My boyfriend and I used to sneak there at lunch time without telling any of our colleagues about it because this place is already so popular that there is always a line at lunch times. They even have a Twitter account to warn customers when they run out of buns.   I have left Toronto about a year ago but I still find myself craving Black Camel's sandwiches..."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said, but felt like I wanted to contribute to their amazing Yelp score. My two favourite sandwiches in the city are the pulled pork from Black Camel and porchetta from Porchetta & Co. I know, I'm not really charting any new territory with those choices but, hey, it is what it is.   Black Camel's thing is their sauce though -- it's delicious. If you're looking for a sandwich that will quite possibly leave you in a food coma for several hours, get the pulled pork at Black Camel."}
{"text":"Tiny place + Sandwich love = Very simple fresh and well-made food.  I've only had sandwiches - braised brisket & chicken - and I keep the house-made toppings spare since two are included. Delectable pulled chicken with their famous BBQ sauce + hummous is amazing; usually a meat sandwich is tender and only moderately seasoned, the bread OK but very plain, and overall I like the very solid deli-style ingredients which seem to comprise good healthy food.  You can go fancy if you want, or keep it basic, my friend likes to kick it up with her brisket. The locals and workers seem friendly and will chat with you. Outside the entrance, seating is surprisingly nice on a warm day and there's also a park with tree shade right across the intersection. Psst... FREE PARKING 1 hr along that park. Yes, you can nearly pay for half of your lunch on that kind of savings in ticket-happy Toronto. So go enjoy it all.  Don't forget the Camel's sister store BOAR near Yonge-Eglinton if you want to experience the same concept expanded into different sandwich choices - less slow roasted meats more italian (the grilled chicken thigh is awesome.)"}
{"text":"It's a ridiculously delicious tasting sandwich.  I had the beef brisket which was melt in your mouth tender and juicy. The tangy sweet BBQ sauce was awesome.  The chipotle mayo and caramelized onions made the sandwich complete.    I'm not going to list all the available sauces and toppings. They have a lot. You can read up on them on their website.  Things that I didn't like so much: * I wish my sandwich had a bit more sauce. * There is not a lot of seating if you want to dine there. * Slow moving line due to sandwich newbs taking their sweet-ass time discussing every possible sandwich combination in detail. * There isn't (legal) parking in front of the place or on Yonge, so you have to find a side street. But it's located right across from Rosedale station, so it's uber easy by TTC. * They can run out of sandwiches, so check their Twitter page!  I can't wait to go back and have another tasty sandwich.  Another camel stamp on my sandwich card, woo hoo!"}
{"text":"Everyone orders the pork or brisket sandwiches here, and they are good - but if you want a different sort of treat, try two of my favourite combinations.  Steak (it's shaved rare roast beef served cold, actually) sandwich with arugula and charmoula mayo. Chicken with arugula,  pesto mayo and fontina. Surprisingly light."}
{"text":"Still one of my favourite sandwich places in the city. I don't get to come here as often as I used to, but it's still as good as ever.   The menu doesn't change much but why fix what's not broken? Best of all, the prices haven't increased much (if at all) since I first came here back in 2010.   If you're looking for a delicious, tasty and carefully-prepared sandwich that won't break the bank, this is THE place to go.  They also have an espresso bar and sell breakfast sandwiches during the mornings (pancetta, smoked salmon, seared steak - all for between $5-7.)  Bonus points for an outdoor patio during the summer, and you can also bring your sandwich to Ramsden Park across the street!"}
{"text":"Beef brisket is the No.1 !!! Extremely juicy and tender.. The meat just malt in the mouth after the bite.."}
{"text":"This is where I go to ruin white shirts. Amazing pulled pork sandwiches with sauce that I want to buy by the gallon. Fast and friendly service for good food. It's just that easy."}
{"text":"Pulled Pork Brisket Sandwich  Food, service, value:4/5  Great little establishment. Very friendly and welcoming.  Repeat: yes"}
{"text":"Love this place and all it stands for!   The beef brisket sandwich is pretty much the best in all of Toronto in my opnion. After eating one of these sandwiches you feel like buying another one even though you all full. (thats how awesome they are)  The Americano is also very good and compliments the sandwich well. If you're into that type of thing.  The place is a little small and seating is limited but the food is definately worth it!"}
{"text":"This place looks like it could be a keeper- friendly staff who include you into conversation like a longtime friend, a small, simple interior, and a menu that gives you the option to mix and match to make your own creation. Plus, the yelp reviews are at a 4.5 - must be something good cookin up over here.   I got a brisket sandwich.   Pros:  -friendly customer service  -food came out quickly  -meat texture= awesome -location- conveniently right outside Rosedale station, like across the street.  Cons -the bun, which was a nice texture, was COLD. That was so beyond disappointing, but I just paid $10 (I added two extras, at $0.90 a topping) for this cold sandwich, that made the meat lukewarm-cold, which was kinda gross. Seriously, how much would a toaster cost? -my $1.80 in toppings were lost in my huge, cold bun.  -the meat really lacks flavour.  -the majority of the sandwich was bread.  -the seating, while minimal, was incredibly uncomfortable.   This sandwich had the texture of a cold tuna fish sandwich I packed myself for lunch in third grade. Chewy, yes, but still cold and tastes a little too much like mayo. Maybe worse.   Maybe I came on a bad day or something, and I feel kinda bad for giving them such a low rating (which was only saved by the service) but man, this was so disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I just love the Black Camel. I'm almost certain that I've reviewed the Black Camel before, but it has been a while.   They aim to please. Their menu is simple, but delicious. The stick to what they know, and they do it perfectly Every Single Time.  Obviously for a sandwich, it's ever so slightly pricey (I typically spend about $9), but it's not your average sandwich.   Their buns are amazing... they're soft, but don't get overly soggy with all of that deliciously juicy meat that they pile on there. I almost always opt for my favourite - the Beef Brisket sandwich. On this visit I got double horseradish, because I like my sandwich with a zing. Holy shiza, did it ever have zing! Note to self, their horseradish is potent, and a single serving would have been enough (it also would have saved me 90 cents, and I'm Dutch, so that's a lot!) I always get this sandwich with Fontana cheese and Sauteed Cremini mushrooms. It's so, so good. This is random, but I really like the way they wrap the sandwich and the paper is tucked in... small detail, but it's pretty cute.  And, the best part... I mean, besides the fact that their food is delicious, the Loyalty program is what really has me hooked! Make sure that you get a stamp card. Buy 12 sandwiches, and you're 13th is free. As my dad would say, that's definitely better than a kick in the pants."}
{"text":"Huge fan of their pulled pork sandwich! There's not a lot of seating inside but black camel is right beside a park where you can easily sit down and enjoy your meal outside. Located right beside rosedale station so it's also very convenient to get to by transit."}
{"text":"Best Sammich in the city... for me anyways. It is rare when I crave sandwiches, but when I do, Black Camel is the first place in mind. It's about a 10 minute walk from work through Ramsden Park so my co-workers and I wait for a super nice day and scope out seats at the park on our way to get our sandwiches.  My usuals: Beef Brisket or Pulled pork with caramelized onions, mushrooms and bbq sauce Nice and warm, So Flavourful and Oh So Messy! But so Good!  Saw a new special - Camel Club - with proscioutto and pesto mayo, gotta try that next time!  Good value, fast and friendly staff, Excellent sandwiches. The space is small with a few seats, but they set up addtional seating outside on nice days. There's always a long line up during lunch, but they work through it pretty quickly and take your order to you when it's ready so you don't have to wait inside when it's cramped and hot."}
{"text":"OMG, one of my fav sandwich places in Toronto. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich and it was ready in less that 3 minutes. The meat was extremely juicy and was bursting with flavour. I wish I discovered this place earlier."}
{"text":"just tried the beef brisket sandwich with pesto mayo and mushroom, it was really good, super juicy tender beef, loved it"}
{"text":"Grabbed a couple of beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches and a large chili for a Sunday lazy day lunch. The sandwiches were a good size, both types of meat were tender and soft. The sauces were super flavourful and stood out the most for me. The ratio of the sauces and add-ons (caramelized onions and mushrooms) were well balanced. The chili was the only left down for me - the large was served in a regular size coffee cup, there were chucks of beef brisket but the chili lacked flavor and was slightly too sour (tomatoes). I had to add extra seasoning to make it taste better.  Overall I'd recommend Black Camel and would return for their beef brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"I happened to come by here on a weekday and knew I had to finally try it out.  It's a small place, but with several ledge seating spaces.  The slow roasted need brisket with the signature BBQ sauce is excellent!  Its slightly bigger than a Big Mac, so decent size for 8 bucks.  Very tasty sauce and tender meat, yum."}
{"text":"Their slow roasted beef brisket is great! Pair it with their unique BBQ sauce and chipotle mayo and then just enjoy your meal.  The staff are very friendly and kind. Their payment system doesn't allow for tipping which isn't good, but you can tell the cashier that you want to tip and then they can manually punch it into your bill. Or just do it the good old way with cash :)"}
{"text":"The Black Camel is the epicenter for amazing sandwiches, the pulled pork being my choice for a little heaven on earth. Eaten sandwiches from Kansas City to New York and Philli but the Black Camel ranks as one of North America's (and Toronto's) ultimate sandwich destinations. Sauces are great to experiment with while still enjoying a perfectly prepared mouth watering taste of well balanced flavors that will have you coming back again and again."}
{"text":"This is located just at the brink of where suburbia begins on Yonge Street.  The place is small and self-serviced.  There are a couple of small tables and a few bar stools.  It closes early (8pm) and has a sign indicating that it often sells out before closing (check their twitter for updates).  The pulled pork sandwich was very tasty.  The bun tasted fresh, was very big and soft with a touch of chewiness.  The pork was flavorful (lots of tomatoes?) and dripping with sauce.  Unfortunately though, the texture of the pork in my sandwich was rather stringy - almost like the meat has been over-stewed.  My advice is perhaps to visit earlier during the day.  I went around 7pm on a Tuesday and the pork tasted like it had probably been sitting in a warmer all day.  I'm quite certain that if you tasted it when it was just made, it'd be much more succulent.  I'd recommend NOT getting any of the additional condiments or toppings.  They give you very little of these extras, so little that you can't really taste them.  Might as well not pay for it.  The only exception is the creamy horseradish, which was nicely strong enough to come through in the sandwich.  The pulled pork was not too bad overall and I would try to come back again to give it a second shot."}
{"text":"I've tried the pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches (with either bbq sauce or mustard or whatever I was in the mood for).  Both were exceptional sandwiches with beautifully moist and juicy meat, tangy sauce/condiments, and a bun that keeps everything from getting too messy.  There's virtually no places to sit but the park nearby has some benches."}
{"text":"Just wanted to do a quick update because the last thing I tried at this place was simply awesome! It's their veggie sandwich made with grilled tomatoes, arugula, red pepper and eggplants. Add basil pesto mayonnaise to that and it's a match made in heaven! It might even eclipse their signature beef brisket sandwich (and this is coming from me, a guy who just loves meat). Everybody has to try it, seriously it's that good!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations, but was very disappointed. I ordered the brisket and the person at the counter suggested I get it with caramelized onions and barbeque sauce. 20 seconds later it was in my hands, clearly having been premade. It was gloopy and soggy and overall disappointing. The quality of the meat , taste of the sandwich, and care that went into food preparation really didn't meet my expectations."}
{"text":"This place has been a part of my life for years, as the other reviewers have already mentioned, the sandwiches are all great, my go to is the Camel Club, it's chicken with fancy Italian bacon, arugula, sundries tomatoes, pesto sauce inside a warm bun. I salivate thinking of it.   The coffee is good, if you are lucky you might get to meet a super friendly black guy who works here sometimes and makes people feel warm and happy by being nice to them.   The prices are reasonable for this part of town, and it gets super busy at lunch, so come before noon or after 1pm or you'll be in line for a while."}
{"text":"Best sandwich ever !  Depuis que j'ai emménagé à Toronto, je suis à la recherche d'endroits sympas pour manger (et je trouve qu'ici c'est pas facile). Mais cet endroit est fantastique!  Étant végétarienne, je n'ai teste que celui au légumes. Mais je peux vous dire que c'est le meilleur que j'ai mangé depuis bien longtemps.   Black camel merci pour cet orgasme culinaire!"}
{"text":"I don't get the insane hype. I have been here twice (beef brisket, pulled chicken) and both times I thought... meh. Good sandwich. Not great. Needed more flavour, more sauce.   Just... blah."}
{"text":"baby, i'm howling for you  My friend Bana has been talking about Black Camel for some time.  I was hungry and found myself at the Canadian Tire near the Masonic Temple.  The bell in my brain rang and I texted Bana to get the exact coordinates of this sandwich shop she was dying to take me to.  I was delighted to find it was just a block away.  I pitterpattered over.    Love at first sight?  Yes, because I like weird creatures.  Like the platypus, and the camel.  They're funny looking.  Gags aside, Black Camel is my favourite kind of joint.  Divey with divine dirrrrttyyyyy eats, and friendly, genuine people taking your order.    They have (amongst other things) sandwiches with pulled pork, beef brisket, seared steak, roasted pulled chicken and a veggie option (and enticing one at that, tomato, pepper, argula and eggplant), all of which you can customize with sauces and toppings.  The prices are reasonable in that it starts at $7 for a sandwich.  I got pulled pork with BBQ sauce and onions.  It was tasty.  Not too sweet, good consistency and really smokey.  The pulled pork is soft, tender and meaty.  The opposite of bad pulled pork which is stringy and gets stuck in your teeth on your first bite.  Shame.  This, however, is quite the opposite.    I almost got two.  Good thing I didn't.  The sandwich is legitimately big.  I will be back next week as the beef brisket is calling my name.  Again, at the risk of sounding redundant, it must be said...this was so good."}
{"text":"Oh boy a visit to the Black Camel was way overdue as had it bookmarked for eons. Since I will been exploring this area a lot more (temp relocation) I decided to give this place a try as was in the vicinity. The setup is minimal as expected because they seem to be geared towards the grab and go crowd. I went at an off peak hour so the place wasn't busy. After a bit of contemplation I decided to go with roast beef brisket and added the BBQ sauce and caramelized onions as per the recommendation of the sales person.  The wait time wasn't long. Now for the sandwich itself hmm this is more of a snack sized for moi and definitely not a meal replacement. The bread is decent and the beef was tender and the BBQ sauce had a sweet finish as expected. The caramelized onions were I think a bit overwhelmed by the other items as I could only taste them on and off. Decent sandwich and by no means worth a detour (is any sandwich worth a detour?) 3 stars."}
{"text":"Having been here once before I have no excuse for making some amateur mistakes.   Last time I was here (years ago!) I had a fantastic pulled pork sammie. This time I decided to diversify, and ordered the pulled chicken with caramelized onions and horseradish. I didn't realize that you got TWO toppings and TWO sauces with each burger. Silly me. My pulled chicken was actually sort of dry. I expected my pulled chicken to be like what I make at home, dripping in BBQ sauce. This had no sauce component that I could see, and was lacking in flavour.  Also the horseradish (delish) made me cry. Funny for my male dining companions, less funny for my...eyes. It was like eating a wasabi sandwich. Oh, don't get me wrong, I'll order horseradish again, because it's delicious, but I was surprised at its strength. Make sure you order mayo or bbq sauce if you order horseradish to cut it a little."}
{"text":"Highlight: super friendly services Ordered pulled chicken w/ pesto+Dijon mustard sauce(recommended by staff)  The chicken itself was a bit dry, and the bun was actually too thick in my opinion. Combination of pesto and Dijon mustard sauce was fine. Not overpriced since the meat portion was huge.($8.5)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice..,. not sure if I'll come a 3rd time.   The first time, the guy working there recommended some topics to add (they are just under a buck per extra topping). Unfortunately I don't quite remember the toppings that were added, but it ended up being a pretty decent sandwich for just over $10.   The second time, I tried just the beef briskit + sauce. I actually didn't think that was very special. I liked the bbq sauce, but my main complaint is that there's not really enough meat. The bun itself is pretty huge, so the ratio is just off IMO. If the bun was smaller with more meat, I'd say it would be a 4 star rating.   If I do return, I'll definitely add 2-3 toppings, because the meat itself isn't enough to make this a great sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is charming, and the service is the very definition of speedy. The staff is patient, and very helpful in explaining the wide array of options on their menu. Coffee is on point to boot. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is a two part review.  On my last lunch in Toronto for a long while a friend brought me here. Wow. This place lives up to the reviews.  We ordered the brisket, the pulled pork, and the steak. All were excellent. Each sandwich we went with a two toppings maximum rule to keep these meaty sandwiches manageable. Heartily endorse. You can not go wrong here.  Now for part two- I was flying back to Europe in the evening. Airplane food being what it it is we ordered two Brisket sandwiches to go with the hope that the bread would stand up to the wait. Threw them in the fridge when we got home. Well I can testify that 12 hours later the sandwich was by far the superior food option at cruising altitude over the North Atlantic.   Honestly you should give it a try if you are traveling. Delicious substantial. Even tastes good on a plane!"}
{"text":"Ok that was pretty good.   Basil pesto mayo!! I mean, wow! The flavour was epic and its making my mouth water right now 6 hrs later. Normally briskets aren't done well and get so dry - this was perfect.   I'm a fan of hot food so next time I think I'm going to request for the buns to be warmed up or toasted slightly. But oh boy!"}
{"text":"Placed my order and waited patiently. About a minute and a half later, I was sinking my teeth into the most delicious brisket sandwich, and two minutes after that it was finished. This hole in the wall rocked my world."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef brisket with caramelized onions and creamy horseradish.  Also a chicken BLT made with prosciutto, sundried tomato and arugula with pulled chicken.   I split 50/50 with my lunch partner.  I personally like my brisket sliced and not pulled...but sandwich was tasty and juicy.  Will try the bbq sauce next time.  I enjoyed the chicken BLT but think they need more meat to bun ratio.  I was hyped up a tad too much for this one. 3.5 stars.  Although the guy working there is super friendly and helpful and that is why I will be back to give another try."}
{"text":"For a downtown deli this place has great deals! Very convenient location right outside rosedale subway. It's a great grab and go sandwich shop. It has limited seating so it may be a wait if that's what your looking for. It is absolutely worth checking out. The service is very friendly and willing to answer as many questions about their product and food. I love how they give you a gold coin with  number for Your order. It was super fast take out which is always a plus when your hungry!"}
{"text":"Last minute pit stop to fuel up and escape torrential downpour. Took a chance on this place and sure glad we did.   Two beef brisket sandwiches, one topped with creamy horseradish, caramelized onions and the other with the black camel BBQ, caramelized onions and roasted red pepper. Both were packed full of flavour and were tender beyond belief.   Super quick service and total bang for your buck.  I'd give an extra star if they tore down the store next door for more seating."}
{"text":"Shared a pulled pork sandwich as a snack (so we each got half), they were very nice to cut it for us so we wouldn't be struggling to share.  Customer service friendly.  Washrooms were less than desirable but they existed.  I enjoyed the sandwich and would have another, but it was very overpriced.  For a pork sandwich with onions and mushrooms, it was $12.  Not an every day treat, but would go back in the summer on a nice walk in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Beef Brisket with Charamoula Mayo, onions and mushrooms - sensational!  Great bread (which helps keep everything inside instead of spilling onto the wrapping), tons of meat, and lots of juice!  You need to go here if you want a sambo!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a million stars but I think that's the beef brisket high talking. If it's your first time here get the beef brisket sandwich. Don't hesitate. Comes to $8 and change for a pretty decent sized sandwich and they have a good selection of sauces and toppings to add on. Service is quick and friendly, we barely sat down and she brought our sandwich over. The place doesn't look like much but it smells delicious. Lord, I'm gonna have dreams about that sandwich for a long time."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, their specialty is beef brisket, with onions and bbq sauce. I put a little bit of chipotle mayo as well and was absolutely delish!   This sandwich is super filling, sometimes line can be long but they move through pretty quickly. Be prepared to eat dirty though as it tends to get everywhere but all worth it =)"}
{"text":"Not sure why there is so much excitement about this place.  First, the service is way too SLOW. Taking orders and making sandwiches from ingredients that are already cooked should not take quite this long. It's understandable for places like Bahmi Boys or 5 Guys where prepping and cooking are needed but the pace in this place is frustrating.  Second, a sandwich served with cold bread and hot meat is not cool. Why don't they take 10 seconds to even warm up the bread??  Here's the combo we had:  1) Beef brisket with charamoula mayo and horseradish: The brisket was okay but nothing special. We can easily have better elsewhere. Btw, anyone who's had real beef brisket in Texas or in the US, don't even waste time on this.   2) Pulled pork with bbq sauce and coleslaw: the pork was tasteless, dry and mushy in texture. How can they even called this pulled pork is beyond me. Anyone who's had proper southern pulled pork or just properly cooked pulled pork will know what I'm talking about.   All in all, we were very disappointed with the meal and confused as to why so many others are ecstatic about their food. The standard in Toronto is low, but seriously?! You can make 10X better brisket and pulled pork at home than this. The Yelp rating guide described our experience with this place perfectly - - \"Eek! Methinks not.\""}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are NSFW - I had to eat this with a fork at my desk or else the contents would have splattered everywhere! I ordered the renowned beef brisket sandwich with fontina cheese, caramelized onions, chamoula (?) mayo and pesto sauce along with a side of 'slaw for dinner tonight. I can't say I wasn't disappointed after reading the glowing reviews about the brisket - the meat is plentiful as others have said, but not too flavourful. The sauces are a nice touch (as were the other toppings) but I didn't feel too satisfied overall. The 'slaw was alright. I suspect the food probably tastes better freshly cooked (I delivered) so I'd definitely consider giving this place a try again in the future! The sandwich hunt continues.."}
{"text":"Praise his noodley appendage.  Wow.  I couldn't believe this sandwich (I got the pulled pork with their BBQ sauce and creamy horseradish).  It was fresh, the meat was not fatty or greasy at all, bun was fresh and nice, what a delicious sandwich.  The meat was tender, just melted in your mouth, I find a lot of the times with pulled pork it's chewy and fatty- - this meat was just spot on.  If they'd get licenced and a bigger patio, they'd do gangbusters in the summer time, who wouldn't want to go for a beer and a sandwich after work?  My fiance had the chili and the rest of the sandwich I couldn't eat and he enjoyed it as well.  Reasonable prices too... why people would go to Quizno's or something when you can get this for the same price... I'll never figure out."}
{"text":"We had our sandwiches delivered to our office for a party. DELICIOUS! Based purely on Yelp recommendations, I had the beef brisket with creamy horseradish and pesto mayo topped with sauteed mushrooms. It's good even cold! The horseradish was not evenly spread throughout the sandwich, so at first I thought that while yummy, the beef brisket was a tad one-dimensional. The spots with the horseradish brought the sandwich to a whole new level. It's a bit greasy, very hardy, and all amazing!"}
{"text":"first time here, after hearing that it was a 'must' for pulled pork and/or brisket.  i had the pulled pork with carmelized onions and bbq sauce, and it was totally delish.  i am going to go back to try the brisket and also the chili."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. The beef brisket sandwich was amazing. The meat was juicy and tender. There was a good fat to lean meat ratio that allowed some of the meat to \"melt\" in your mouth. Give this place a try if you're in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Nice folks.  Nice pulled pork sandwiches.  Nice variety of toppings and sauces.  I wouldn't go out of my way to get here, but it beats having a Subway sub."}
{"text":"Black Camel aka YAAAAS!  Hands down the best sandwich I've ever had accompanied with excellent customer service. If you can make me, an awkward person, have conversation - you're probably doing great. I got the beef brisket sandwich with pesto, bbq sauce, and coleslaw around 1 on a weekday. There were a few people grabbing things to go and I was glad I only waited a minute for it. They have around 10 seats in store and although the shop is tiny, it does the job.  Now onto the mouth watering sandwich. The beef brisket had the perfect melting texture (I'm not good at describing meats) and the sauces that accompanied it was delicious! Coleslaw made it even better. They also put a hand wipe napkin inside too which is so cute and shows that once again, Black Camel goes above and beyond.  Will. Return. SOON!"}
{"text":"By far the best sandwich place in the city. It's family owned, super friendly and they make great sandwiches!   I told my boyfriend that the bread is what makes it, but then again, it's the sum of the parts. Everything about these sandwiches is good! They're fresh, tasty, not too dry, not sopping wet. Just right, spite of its busyness and cramped space. Although there are tables outside in spring and summertime.  Can't order take out until after 2 pm and the place fills up quickly but the wait is worth it.   I had the pulled chicken sandwich with chipotle aioli and BBQ sauce with mushrooms and onions. It was really tasty and savory! I'm salivating just thinking about it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this spot, and I am often lured into going here anytime we are north of Bloor. I admit the pulled pork sandwiches here are fantastic, and that is why I never complain when he suggests Black Camel. Midday on weekends there are always lineups of hungry people, but the lines move pretty quickly. Lots of topping options. Make sure to grab extra napkins to clean up the sauce!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches at a good price. There is little to no seating but that it fine as in the spring and summer it is really nice to take your sandwiches to the park and have a sweet little picnic. I definitely recommend going if you're in the mood for fast, fresh sandwiches."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and cozy location. The Slow Cooked Beef Brisket is amazing; try it with their recommended sauce Black camel BBQ and add caramelized onion and be careful with your fingers! :-)"}
{"text":"We were loyal customers, came to this location every Sunday for lunch for the past two years. The beef brisket and veggie sandwiches were our go to order. One of the guys Sam knew us on a first name basis and always gave excellent customer service. Then the next guy who wore his shirts tucked into his Levi's was also awesome and knew our orders... but at the end of August/ September there were girls starting to work there. The portions on the sandwiches were not the same but we kept going. The female workers did not provide the same genuine, customer- worker experience that the previous male workers did nor did they make an effort to form that relationship. The final straw was waiting for our order on a non busy Sunday and while waiting the redhead girl in the back was texting on her phone with her BARE hands then went and got out our sandwich buns and put the toppings on STILL with her bare hands.   We have not gone back since, they have lost our business"}
{"text":"I've probably been here 25+ times and I keep coming back.  Note that I have had the same sandwich pretty much every time I've been (chicken, with bbq sauce, chipotle sauce, red peppers, and cheese) and it has always been fantastic.  Service is great (line is never huge, and it moves quickly whenever there is one), they always ask your name for when your order is ready, and the staff are very friendly.  Great selection of drinks (not just the usual pop - they have Brio, and some other flavourful options) and some good kettle chips if you're looking for something with your sandwich.  The best tip I can offer is that if you expect to visit regularly, get one of the \"cards\" - they will keep it on-hand rather than having to remember it every time - and 12 sandwiches gets you a free one.  The sandwiches aren't super cheap (I'm in for about $12 for a sandwich and a Brio, given the red peppers/cheese are extra) but you know that going in, and they're delicious.  Enough said."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised I've never reviewed this place, it's one of my favourite lunchy places to sneak friends to and to go out of my way to enjoy when I'm in the mood. Just across the street from Rosedale Subway station, it's a super convenient and fast location for great sandwiches.  Now, what do I usually get? I'm pretty easy. Beef brisket with bbq sauce and carmelized onions. DONE. Yeah, that's it. Nothing extra, maybe a dash of hot sauce from the counter but that's all and I wouldn't have it any other way. But if you every have questions, don't fail to ask, the staff can make a quick recommendation that will take your sandwich from average to superfantastique. Their pulled chicken is also well done and I know people who swear by the pulled pork, but really? The brisket for me.   Grab a can of coke and this meal is just under $10 and worth every penny. Do not delay! Get one today!"}
{"text":"I ate twice at Camel this week and my friend had three in two days. It seemed like an appropriate time to finally write my review on Black Camel. When we embarrassingly mentioned it had been our 3rd and 2nd visit in two days they weren't the least bit shocked. \"It's a common occurrence\", according to the friendly face that always takes my order. I'm not shocked either. The bun...ooo that bun. Better then any burger bun I've ever had. Golden, sweet, chewy bun. I just want to squeeze a bag full of them. Alright, enough with my erotic food fantasies.  As mentioned above, I often visit Black Camel since I work in the area. It's the perfect sandwich on a cold day, to cozy up on a stool by the window with a warm meaty camel. It's also the perfect sandwich in the summer, to soak in the sunny rays on their makeshift patio with a grilled vegetable packed camel. It's really the perfect sandwich for any time of the year, as long as you've got an appetite.  Service is wonderful. The guy or gal at cash are helpful with suggestions and never rush you. They're incredibly passionate about their sandwiches and they've been there forever. Same chefs too.   You've got a chalkboard full of options. Roast Beef, Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken, Brisket, Roasted Vegetables and so on. You also get a complimentary condiment and sauce.  Extra toppings are 0.90cents  These are my usual Camels: 1. Pulled Chicken. I add Charmoule Mayo, Arugula,  Roasted Cherry Tomatoes and Horseradish. SOOO GOOD! Really filling. 2. Roasted Vegetable - Eggplant, Roasted Cherry Tomatoes, Arugula and Red Pepper. I only add The Basil Pesto Mayo. I actually feel like I can eat two of these in one sitting.   They are busy for most of the day but are quick to deliver. Make sure to check their twitter feed to see if they've run out of buns.  http://twitter.com/#!/black_camel They update on how many buns they have left or if they've sold out. If there's nothing left...they close the doors. This may anger a few but it's actually pretty comforting to know they are not over stocking and everything is fresh on the day of!  You need to put this on your list of top 100 things to do before you die."}
{"text":"The line up for this place is often out the door, and deservedly so. The bread is so soft and the meat delicious. This is a wonderful, unpretentious place to grab lunch. The staff are warm and friendly. They obviously take pride in what they do.   This place is so simple yet so good. I highly recommend the pulled pork, which is what I usually get, but there are plenty of other great options.   Follow them on Twitter so you know if they're running out of buns before you go."}
{"text":"Yum!!! They definitely passed the sandwich connoisseur test! I tried the pulled chicken with arugula and their amazing BBQ sauce. The bread is also delicious !!!"}
{"text":"fantastic. everything about the sandwich was how it should be. it's not just hype.  Sure it's just a sandwich but so much can go wrong if it's poorly done.  I had the beef brisket with bbq sauce, horseradish sauce and fontina cheese.  the buns are perfect. beef was done right.  service is great. mind you it wasn't busy when we went today."}
{"text":"I have to admit that the service is super friendly here.  Coming here on a Saturday afternoon after work (why do I work weekends!!!!), I decided to take walk up Yonge street.  Realizing that I had Black Camel bookmarked, I made a dash towards Rosedale station.  When I arrived, I was unsure of how things worked, but the cashier told me what to do.  She told me the most popular item was the Slow Roasted BBQ Beef brisket with caramelized onions and since I'm easy, I said ok.    What I liked:   -The BBQ sauce was amazing.   -The brisket was nice and tender and there was ample amounts of it.   -There was plenty of meat -They give you lots of napkins and a towelette since they know it will be messy (this was so awesome!!!).    What I wasn't a fan of: -Slightly pricey at $7.50 + 0.90 per additional topping. So this sandwich was $8.40.   -The bun was fresh, but it had a texture similar to a kaiser bun.  I don't like kaiser buns.  Too chewy and sometimes hard.  However, I guess they have to have a harder bun or else all the meat would leak out and the sandwich would get too soggy.     Overall, this place is a very good sandwich place and a great once in a while treat."}
{"text":"Pulled pork with bbq sauce and coleslaw. YUMBO. I tried not to eat the whole thing, like REALLY tried, but alas there was nothing I could do to stop myself from scarfing the whole sandwich. GO. NOW."}
{"text":"It's my first time there so I asked the owner what I should get. He suggested me the popular option - beef brisket sandwich with BBQ sauce and sauteed onions. I wasn't disappointed as the sandwich bun was big and fluffy and the beef brisket was juicy and tender. I also appreciated the fact that they gave me wet naps! :)  The only improvement I could think of is that the sandwich was only lukewarm.  It's just minor. I could give it 5 stars next time if it is hotter.   Super quick and friendly service too.  4.5 stars"}
{"text":"I have heard of this place before but never found the place until I took a stroll down yonge. Now this is my favourite spot to go to for a quick bite. I frequent the place many times now and the service here is fairly quick even at peak hours. Be warned though at peak hours there will be a line up and during the Summer they sell out pretty fast. They update on their twitter page whether they will be selling out soon or have already sold out for the day.  It's a small shop just outside of the Rosedale subway station. Not really a shop to sit and eat unless you are a party of two or one. Most customers get their sandwiches to-go.  I usually come here just before lunch hour to avoid the rush of people. The pricing is great for what you get. My go to sandwich is the slow roasted pulled pork with Black Camel bbq sauce and chipotle mayo for a bit of kick. If they run out of pulled pork then my second choice would be the brisket with the same sauces. For a bit extra you can purchase coleslaw or chilli if a sandwich won't fill you up.  Black Camel also serves up espresso, coffee or tea if you need that morning/afternoon pick-me-up. And if you're not in the mood for either of those they have hot chocolate! Black Camel also offers breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Never usually a fan of smoked burgers, but this is something else. Good prices. Taste better than summer festivals like Rib fest in my opinion"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I really like their pulled pork sandwiches and coleslaw.  Black Camel is a tiny place and it gets super busy  during lunch so getting a seat is almost impossible."}
{"text":"Redefines the word sandwich for me. Stop reading the reviews and go get urself a serious sandwich here. Seriously.  If this is your first time, get the must-try: beef brisket + onions + bbq sauce. If you want to mix it up a little, get the seared steak (room temp) + Charamoula mayo + sun dried tomatoes OR the Camel Club"}
{"text":"There is no better sandwich shop in Toronto. I came here as a vegetarian and devoured the grilled veggie sandwich and now I am a full fledged lifelong fan of the pulled pork. Visit. U will not regret it.   not too much room for sitting, but also a park nearby & great to go !"}
{"text":"I don't know what the fuss is all about. We tried both the pulled pork sandwich and the beef brisket, and the differences between the two were unidentifiable. We made the mistake of ordering sauce on it, not knowing they would drench the entire sandwich in it... I wasn't impressed by the sauce, so it was hugely disappointing that there was so much of it. It was like eating (not particularly good) stewed, shredded meat with a ton of sauce on it, plopped on an over-sized bun. The pieces of the meat that escaped the heavy dose of sauce seemed awfully dry, so you basically have the choice of either eating dry meat or overly-sauced meat.  The meat-to-bun ratio seemed off to me; I ended up throwing half of the bun away. For a really good beef brisket sandwich with big chunks of meat (and great texture) as opposed to shredded/finely diced/whatever it is they do here, go to Leslieville Pumps."}
{"text":"Tried this sandwich heaven due to countless recommendations by all who'd tried. Fantastic tasting filling sandwiches. Totally recommended! #BlackCamel"}
{"text":"This place is great, small menu, but good food..   One thing, I wish there is a bit more meat on the sandwich. I felt like there was more bun that meat, and they could really use more sauce in their sandwiches..  The taste is great, I tried their beef brisket with mayo and BBQ sauce and I fell in love! The sandwich size is huge, but mostly because of the bun.  There isn't a lot of seating and I noticed most of their customers do take-out orders. Service is pretty quick, and I think I will be coming back, whenever I am in the area, and craving for a quick bite."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place and without any doubt we left very happy. The service was very friendly, the place was small but cozy and the food was delicious!  The buns went perfectly well with the chicken and pork, the ingredients tasted fresh and the portions were quite satisfying.   Looking forward to trying the rest of the items in the menu!"}
{"text":"It is not often that I am downtown looking for lunch, it's usually breakfast or dinner, so I headed for Black Camel near to Rosedale subway station to have a sandwich. I have been there a few times before and have never been disappointed. They were busier than I usually find, but I expected that at midday. There was a lineup when I arrived, and it got pretty crowded because the place is really not much bigger than a hole in the wall. But they were working thru the line pretty quickly, so it was only about 5min before I had my sandwich in hand. Not much place to eat, but there are a couple tables outside, although it seemed that a lot of the people were eating across the street in Ramsden Park.  As for the sandwiches, they come warm on a soft thick bun, with a choice of 2 sauces and then extra toppings for $0.90 each. I had the pulled pork with their BBQ sauce and horseradish, along with cremini mushrooms. It was delicious; the meat was tender, the bun was stuffed full, and the sauces were sharp. I've also had the slow-roasted beef brisket and the seared steak (which is their cold sandwich), and they have a vegetarian option as well. Other sauce options include Dijon mustard and chipotle mayo, with chili-roasted onions and Fontina cheese as extra toppings. They also serve a variety of coffees and teas along with the usual cold drinks.  My total bill was $10; I'm pretty sure they used to be cash only, but they were accepting credit/debit cards this time. Definitely worth visiting again; a hearty recommendation!!"}
{"text":"After my first visit here I was going to give this place 3 stars.   As part of my unofficial mission to eat every pulled pork sandwich in Toronto, I was surprised that while it was a perfectly good sandwich, I was underwhelmed. The problem was that the sandwich just wasn't as saucy as I like pulled pork to be. The meat was tender, the bun was fresh, but the sandwich was just a bit dryer and unseasoned than I expected.  So on round 2, I got extra sauce on the sandwich and next thing I knew I was dealing with what could potentially be the best pulled pork sandwich in the city! They actually put the sauce on the bottom and the top of the meat when you get double sauce so everything is right where it needs to be, surrounded in savoury sauces.  The coleslaw I ordered on the side was still a bit weak, as they clealy pre-package earlier in the day and the sauce has mostly drained to the bottom of the coffee cup in which it is served in... And being a cup instead of a bowl its hard to stir it all up, so the while the bottom half of the serving is decent, the top half is much like my opinion of my first sandwich experience... Too dry!  One thing I will say is that despite the small storefront, they are rather efficient at churning out the customers. They've got a rather efficient process of taking orders and then a person running out orders to waiting customers, and being so close to the TTC, making a lunch time food mission isn't out of the question."}
{"text":"Great little \"secret\" cafe serving up tasty sandwiches right next to the Rosedale subway station. I tried out their pulled pork sandwich and it was heaven...I felt like I needed to crawl afterwards as I was incredibly full.  The sandwiches seem expensive but once you realize they give you 3 hours of fuel it becomes cheap."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich is the reason people come here. They actually marinate it for 3 days in spices then roast it overnight. Its served on a soft Portuguese bun.  However, their salmon sandwich is also excellent and moist and juicy.  They do take out best!"}
{"text":"At night, when I close my eyes to go to sleep, I dream of Black Camel sandwiches.   I'm obsessed.  Every week I find myself trying to conjure up reasons to head up to Rosedale station just to get my fix.  Sometimes I even buy in bulk and save the extra sandwiches for a midnight snack, morning after breakfast, or even sadly enough second dinner.   So yes I know, $10 for a sandwich may be steep for some of y'all, but let me tell you it's like choosing a Ferrari over every other establishments Pinto (or for those of you too young to know what that is please substitute in any Kia model). And sure the Pulled Pork sandwich may be epic, and may have even beat out the best of Toronto's Burgers for Best Burger a few years back, but what most people don't know is that the Pulled Pork is just the tip of the iceberg. If you are a Camel virgin it's always a safe bet, BUT for those who fancy being different and have deeper pockets might I recommend the Roasted Chicken w/ Charamoula, red onions, Arugula and roasted tomato OR even the beef brisket with caramelized onions, Mushrooms, BBQ sauce and chipotle.  Sure they have a veggie option, but as I once overheard in line \"Going to Camel and ordering a Veggie is like going to a bar and ordering a glass of milk\", you just don't do it."}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the best sandwiches I've had in Toronto. Tried the brisket and the BLT with chicken. Topping choices were easy to select and very complimentary. Good beverage selection. Good prices. Expertly crafted sandwiches. My only gripe was there were no spicy options.  Definitely a resto I'll hit up again. Next time bring a book to read across the street on a nice summer day."}
{"text":"So, so good - A must try. Pulled meet sandwiches with gourmet toppings. This place is such a hidden gem and local favourite."}
{"text":"mmmmmmm  I got super lucky the other day and stopped in on my way through Rosedale subway back to work after an appointment. I ordered, paid, and was handed a sandwich before I could put my change in my purse! All the other times I've come at lunch it's been a wait! Lucky day!!   I also must point out that one sandwich provides lunch for 2 days! That is how big this thing is. So that $7 extends a long way.   Delicious. I always get the pulled pork. Now that I've had this super quick experience, I'll be back sooner to try something different! Hope the speed lasts!"}
{"text":"I didn't want to write a review until I've tried a few sandwiches because I'll admit, the first one, pulled pork, was good but wasn't enough to inspire a review... since then I've been back probably 10 times, brought countless friends and colleagues, had enough sandwiches to fill up a loyalty card, got a free sandwich and then some. All this since May 11th 2010, when a friend and I couldn't get a table at the Globe and was looking for something in the area.  Favourite sandwich, pulled chicken with bbq sauce, chipotle mayo, chili red onions and grilled eggplant. Love that their toppings are reasonably priced, 90 cents! Unlike some other places where 2 toppings ends up being the same price as the sandwich. The pulled chicken is a great canvas for toppings and sauces really carries the sauces well.   I liked this sandwich so much I didn't order anything else for a good 2 months.   Today I finally tried the Brisket with bbq sauce, chipotle mayo, chili onions and arugula and it was amazing! Brisket is definitely meat front and center, everything else as an accent.  Brisket or Pulled Chicken, it'll be a touch call every visit from now on.  Pulled pork lovers don't despair, it's still good, just love the other 2 more.  Other tips... get a loyalty card, have them keep it for you, be prepared to get take away as they are usually busy and seating is limited, be prepared to get a little messy, play with the toppings and sauces as I haven't had one I did not like."}
{"text":"To quote Mr Bing; \"Could there BE a neighbourhood less deserving of a gem like this?\"    Before crossing the street from the Rosedale subway exit, you have to ask yourself \"Is there a good chance I'll be hit by a slurpee swillin' Porsche driver?\" (true story)  I have been going to this place since it opened. The staff are amazingly nice, the proximity to the Yonge subway line makes it easy to do a lunch run from  North York(!).  The staff have told me the guy who opened this place is a retired lawyer and is basically running it out of love.   No duh!    The quality-to-price ratio is off the charts. For $7.00 you get basically an entire meal that is top notch ingredients. My old standby is the slow cooked Brisket sandwich.  People have opted for the pulled pork but my inner-mensch can't say no to brisket.  Topped with their home made BBQ sauce, it is BUTTAH! It is so delicious and tender that jaw surgery out-patients can subsist on them.   As good as the brisket is, the grilled veggie sandwich is even better.  The sharp hits of arugula with grilled eggplant melding with the chipotle mayo, is pure genius. Seriously, when was the last time you craved a veggie sandwich? Perfection."}
{"text":"Honestly, I only get the pulled chicken sammy's and occasionally the pulled pork.  I get it with charmoula mayo and bbq sauce and/or carmelized onions. It always hits the spot.   I used to go here maybe once a week when I lived in the area, sometimes 2-3 times a week. Nothing like a good sandwich any time of the week.  Lots of different topping options. The line ups at times tend to be long. The workers are incredibly friendly though.  Only problem is that it is a bit expensive for a simple (but tasty and comforting) sandwich  Would I return? Yes if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I'll say right off the bat that my score is slightly unfair. My love is for the pulled pork of another, so when I walked into 'Black Camel' to taste what was dubbed \"The Greatest Pulled Pork in Toronto\", I was set-up for disappointment.  Hypothetically speaking, had I never been to 'Phil's Original BBQ', I may have liked the pulled pork at 'Black Camel' a little better. The sandwich was packed with meat and the sauce was pretty tasty on its own merits. However, I found myself dreaming, and wishing, for Phil's sauce with every bite, just to be sorely disappointed each time.   The bread had an odd taste to it, almost overpowering the meat at times, but there was more than enough meat to stop it from happening too often.  The service was quick, but the place is so small that the people ahead of me pounced on the odd free seat - forcing me to sit out in the cold. Again, I don't have a problem with this in some places, but knowing I could be in the warm confines of another was just another disappointment.   The sandwich was a little pricey as well. For the same cost, I could get a sandwich, albeit a smaller one, with a wonderful side of beans elsewhere. I was satisfied, hunger-wise, at the end of my sandwich, but I would have preferred to mix the palette up a little.  I don't see myself returning to 'Black Camel' in the future. I'm sure the people in Rosedale love it, but with the subway right there, I would much rather ride the rocket to 'Phil's'."}
{"text":"Came here because of all the hype and had the Beef Brisket sandwich. It was good and reasonably priced but I suppose I'm too used to Texas brisket because the chopped up meat that came on my sandwich was mildly disappointing. When I get a brisket sandwich, I imagine succulent slabs of beef. Also, counting bbq sauce as a topping seems a bit of a stretch. Would still return though."}
{"text":"Quick food. Friendly service. Staff come and collect wrappers at the end. They come out to bring you the food. There isn't much to knock about those place.  If you need parking, Rosedale Street parking is generally friendly but you better look out for the signs. I'm sure it's not free all the time. Just a short walk.  Otherwise, right across from the subway station is very convenient.  The BLT chicken has a really good taste to it. Seating is limited but that's OK, their sandwiches stay together so it's easy.  Wonder if they switch to the menu every so often. I think that's be really good for a place that just serves sandwiches."}
{"text":"I used to come here during the partying days of my (slowly evaporating) youth. We would go out to a bad club, crash at our friend's place in Rosedale (who has what is undoubtedly the most comfortable pullout couch in all the world) and wake up around 2pm with slow-cooked meat on the brain. Disgusting, I know, but it meant almost weekly trips down the street to the sweet shady back patio of Black Camel for their fantastic BBQ sammies, which really is a beautiful thing.   Last week after a night out with my friend visiting from Kentucky, I awoke at 2pm with a BBQ craving and thought back to this place. The patio is no longer there, but the sammies were as good as I remembered.   I got the PULLED PORK w/ onions, peppers, BBQ sauce and chipotle mayo (the mayo is a must, otherwise things do end up just a bit dry).   My friend got the BEEF BRISKET w/ mushrooms, onions, BBQ sauce and charamoula mayo. I have no idea what that charamoula shiz is but I imagine it is good, because a look of pure bliss crossed my bud's face when he dove in.   Buddy recently told me he can't wait to come back to Toronto to get another sandwhich at Black Camel. Yup. The MAN FROM KENTUCKY wants to come back to TORONTO for BBQ. That good."}
{"text":"Amazing sanwiches!  Tasty, warm, amazing soft buns.  Only thing I would complain about is the space. Not really a place to dine in."}
{"text":"Jumping on the bandwagon. BLACK CAMEL (type the name out for higher word count..) is excellent. It's a small shop (I wouldn't go at RUSH periods, personally). The brisket, pulled pork; all repeat business worthy! YUM."}
{"text":"I went to the Black Camel for the first time on the weekend with a close guy friend and he was definitely right when he said the following:  \"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SERIOUS MEAT SANDWICH, BLACK CAMEL IS THE PLACE!\"  Located off of Yonge near Summerhill, this little hole in a wall is meaty heaven! First of all, their specialty is meat sandwiches and they serve the following meats in a pulled, shaved type form - Beef, chicken and pork.  The meat is put into a soft hamburger bun with your choice of sauces.  The sauce options are the following:  - Basil Pesto Mayo - Chipotle Mayo - BBQ Sauce - Hummous - Spicy Sauce  I got the pulled chicken sandwich on a bun with basil pesto mayo and hummous and it was soooooooooooooooo delicious!  Honestly if you are in the mood for a \"serious\" sandwich, check out the Black Camel!  The line-ups just prove it is worth the wait and the drive to try one of these yummy gems."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches I've ever had. The meatier, less Italian sister of Boar."}
{"text":"Was looking for a cheap lunch option that did not involve pub grub. I ordered the brisket with dijon mustard as the sauce. No other toppings. It was served in a big, warm bun. It is surprisingly filling. Despite the wait, it came out swiftly."}
{"text":"Slow roasted beef brisket, caramelized onions, camel BBQ sauce, chipotle mayo. BAM! That's the best sandwich in Toronto right there.   My mouth is currently watering as I write this. The Camel is too damn good.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here mid-afternoon on a Saturday since we were nearby and was hungry for a quick bite to eat. Came in here and ordered the pulled pork sandwich with horseradish sauce and basil pesto mayo along with a pecan tart, and it was pretty amazing! The pulled pork sandwich came out after about a 5 min wait and it was presented in a nice, doughy round bread with the succulent pulled pork stuffed inside it. The sauces created the perfect mix of juiciness and flavor and it was enough to hit the spot and alleviate my hunger for the afternoon! The pecan tart was amazing as well with great crumbly crust and a sweet (but not overpoweringly so) center filled with pecan. There was also an extensive drink menu that we did not have time to try, but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love pulled pork and have chased it across the US and Canada. This one was below average. The pulled pork was room temperature and a little tough. The enormous bun overwhelmed the sandwich. It's supposed to be about the meat, not the bread. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Their food are real food!! So delicious!! Love it so much~  Not pricy but great portion of meat. I ordered brisket with chipolte mayo and their house made bbq sauce. There are lots of brisket in the sandwich and their sauce was really to die for!! Actually I thought their sandwich bread was not good enough. The bread seemed not very fresh and should be grilled to warm or hot. Awesome place!! The staff was also very friendly and provided a tiny menu that you can tick off what you want on that, give it to them, then they can be quickly served to save your time. I would defintely come back and try their pulled pork or other selections. Try it please!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are pretty good. I tried the Pulled BBQ Pork Shoulder, awesome. And the Chili is great too. Seeing customers coming in non-stop for nearly 30 mins. That's how busy they were."}
{"text":"A solid 2 for vegetarians. Amazingly fast and friendly service, I love the variety of sandwiches, sauces and toppings otherwise.   But the only vegetarian choice, though nice enough, was tough and difficult to eat - I spent a solid chunk of time just trying to bite through the bread and tough eggplant/veggies. I also would have expected more inside, but it was mostly bun and sauce. Hummus and pesto were nice, I just don't feel the urge to revisit after exhausting their options.   Also, after the sandwich, I'm still hungry. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Someone told me to try this when I 1st moved to Toronto because I'm from sandwich country in Midwestern USA.  I didn't go immediately because I'm very seldom in Rosedale.   It actually took me 2 years to act on the recommendation.  I was so impressed and upset with myself for waiting so long that I tried to build a time machine out of a Sega Dreamcast and a potato. When that failed, I just stayed up all night thinking about when I was going back next.  Slow cooked brisket or pork (they have pulled chicken, seared steak, and eggplant too) on the perfect bun.  You know how many people forget that the bun is a major ingredient in not f'n up a sandwich?  Basically 70% of sandwich makers.  Good lawd it's a good  chomp.  Make several trips, get your sauce/topping combos right.   My personal favourite:  Pulled Pork, Mushrooms, Pesto Mayo, and Horseradish.  Yatta!"}
{"text":"Here it is! First bite, it was super yummy.  The bread was good and the beef was very soft.  Now I see why all the rage.  The tomatoes and mushroom added a nice touch to the overall taste, but I found the sandwich to be a bit dry mid way through.  Next time, I would definitely recommend some greens.  Arugula was on the condiments options.  Adding the arugula should make the sandwich less dry next time.  http://stellarperspectives.wordpress.com/"}
{"text":"This small, almost no seating joint is right across from the Rosedale subway station exit. It's not well lit and as the photos show it's a dark exterior so you can quite easily miss it. I did.   Staff was friendly, picking up on they had a \"newb\" and let me figure out the menu in peace. I had the beef brisket with bbq sauce, garlic mayo, and onions. My beef brisket was extremely delicious. I'll say that much.  The only down side is it's not a very big sandwich and it's $7. A big eater could probably slam two and that can be a pricey addiction. It would be nice if they threw in some slaw or something alongside the sandwich or upped their portion size.  I'd probably be back if these suckers were $5."}
{"text":"I ate a bbq pulled pork sandwich with caramelized onions  at black camel the other day and absolutely loved it. The actual restaurant is a bit small and so i'd recommend going across the street and eating it on one of the park benches there. This has to be one of the best pulled pork sandwiches i have ever eaten. The flavor reminded me of a restaurant called cafe Paradise in Bombay that i have been eating at since i was a kid and so i instantly fell in love with it. I haven't eaten at that restaurant for a couple of years now and so was really excited to eat something that tasted so close to what the restaurant back in bombay served. I only wish that they used a slightly thinner bread so that i could taste more of the pulled pork but that is a silly complaint to be honest. So yea, great food that i cant wait to get more of soon."}
{"text":"Having tried both the pork and the beef, I feel comfortable leaving a review for this little sandwich shop.    Simplicity and quality  is the name of the game at the Black Camel.  The menu offers only  a handful of sandwiches, but what it lacks in choice it makes up for on quality.  The sandwiches taste fantastic and are prepared with (what appear to be)  the finest ingredients.   Each sandwich   comes with a choice of two sauces.  You can add a few toppings for 0.90 cents each, but the meat is sufficiently flavourful to forego extra toppings.  I will definitely be coming back.  The only drawback are the short hours.  I wish it was open later."}
{"text":"I had my best sandwich in Toronto here! It is SO great! The slow cooked beef brisket with caramelized onions is my favourite. Great spot with always friendly staff. They have a good variety of sauces to choose from. It is a must try if u live in Toronto."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place out, it has been bookmarked and on my list for quite a while. I was actually disappointed, I wasn't unhappy but I felt meh afterwards.  First they didn't have enough meat, just enough for one sandwich and there was 3 of us so we decided to get the one and split it, turns out maybe it was for the best because it was just okay, nothing more...  I may come back but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"In this great big city, it's been hard to find a good spot for a quick bite that has a reasonable price tag. My go-to is a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw. I've eaten at Cherry Street BBQ (great), Adamson BBQ (okay), Hogtown Smoke, and many more.   My favorite Pulled Pork Sandwich is from Black Camel, when I'm in the area and need a filling sandwich I head over.   I get the Pulled Pork Sandwich with extra BBQ sauce, Chipotle mayo and coleslaw. It is fantastic.   The bun is always fresh, super soft and soaks up all the flavor from the meat and sauce. The meat is tender, juicy and has great flavor. The combination of chipotle mayo and BBQ sauce works really well. The mayo has a smokey flavor and mix it with the sweetness of the BBQ sauce and you are set.   Please check this place out! Warning; no parking! So I call ahead and order and pick it up."}
{"text":"First time I've been here was because my friend suggested it.  He highly recommended it and since then, I haven't been able to get it out of my mind.  Years later, I come back here and it's still delicious as ever!  My friend also really liked it, devoured it in a minute or two.    The service itself is really fast, because they basically have the meat ready so it's just a matter of putting in a bun.  So when you order, you get 2 choices of sauce and I just ask what's the best for my beef brisket and they said the BBQ and chipotle sauce.   You can smell the awesomeness from the outside, as apparently, they smoke their meat outside.  Yum!  The place has a very limited seating, but I've only really seen a couple of other stay to eat.  People were usually just in and out.    Overall, if you're in this area, right cross Rosedale station, stop by and be satisfied!"}
{"text":"The beef brisket with caramelized onions is the MUST have item for first time visitors. My new favourite is the veggie sandwich (Roma Tomato, Red Pepper, Arugula, & Eggplant) with Pesto Mayo. Friendly staff knows their stuff - orders are fulfilled quickly."}
{"text":"A great little sandwich shop right across the street from Rosedale station. I'd heard of this place before but I didn't realize how close it was to me, might as well check it out! Their menu is quite small but what they do offer is pretty fantastic, and you can customize your sandwich with a bunch of different sauce and topping choices.   I got their vegetarian sandwich (they may be known for their beef brisket and pulled pork but they know their veggies too) w/ Black Camel BBQ sauce, charamoula mayo, & fontina cheese. As other reviewers have mentioned, the fontina cheese is a must; the sandwich itself was packed with flavour but the cheese really finished it off. I'd also recommend those two sauces because they're uniquely Black Camel (not to mention delicious)!  For under $10, it was a surprisingly filling meal. I just probably won't be coming here often because of the limited choices."}
{"text":"I used to visit someone who lived in Rosedale pretty often, and so I worked out an arrangement with the Rosedale ticket guy. If the bus wasn't less than 5 minutes away, I could pop out to visit Black Camel, and he would let me back in before the bus came. What a guy.  Anyways, great sandwiches. The club is my personal favorite but the pulled pork and brisket are great as well. the sauces are all good, i wish extra toppings weren't so pricey."}
{"text":"The slow-roasted beef brisket at Black Camel is one of the best things ever squished between soft buns. Goddamn that's a good brisket sandwich. Supremely tasty, abundantly tender beef....simply melt-in-your mouth, meaty goodness.  I order mine with their homemade BBQ sauce or homemade charamoula mayo (or both if I'm feeling extra saucy). I also enjoy caramelized onions on top.  Probably one of the best sandwiches in Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious quick lunch. The brisket is a bit over cooked for my taste, but the flavours are fantastic. Great bun, caramelized onions are a really nice touch.   Next time I'm gonna try the pulled chicken!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Beef was tender and it all came on a perfect bun."}
{"text":"This place knows how to make one good sandwich! The unassuming store front just off Yonge can be easy to miss and I got quite concerned when the place was deserted.  However, I decided to try it anyway and I'm glad I did! They recommended the beef brisket but being a chicken fan myself, I went for the pulled chicken. The chicken was so juicy! I went outside my comfort zone and asked for the BBQ sauce. It had a teeny bit of a kick but worth it. Having arugula in place of lettuce gave the sandwich a bit more density.  The bun was the low part of the meal. I was expecting it to be soft from the sauce but it was not. Regardless, the rest of the sandwich made up for it.  I accompanied the sandwich with a green tea which was, once again, a decision outside of my comfort zone. It was so flavourful and made me almost become a tea fan.  I'm already planning my next sandwich from the place."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I had the pulled pork sandwich with bbq sauce and chipotle mayo. Delicious! Better than some joints that will cost you 4 times as much.   Nowhere to sit however: just a counter and a few tables on the sidewalk.  So get your food to go; take it home; open a shiraz and enjoy."}
{"text":"The Black Camel features great sandwiches.  For about $12, you can get a delicious brisket sandwich (or pork or chicken or a few other choices) with a choice of made-n-house toppings, along with chips and a drink.    The service here is friendly, which is worth noting.  Some popular places in town don't seem to think this matters.  Black Camel delivers with a smile.  The only knock on this place is its size.  On a cold day, you may not find a seat inside.  You may wait out in the cold to get in and order.  While the wait is mostly worth it and the food comes out reasonably fast, you might consider somewhere else to bring grandma after church on a Sunday, or to meet a group of friends who want to sit inside."}
{"text":"This place goes above and beyond - I don't give 5's that often. The place needs to be exceptional and black camel is exceptional in every way. Amazing customer service, sandwich is made in timely fashion, and the best, most delicious beef brisket sandwich I have ever tasted.  They recommended the beef brisket with bbq sauce, and caramelized onions - I tried that and have been getting it ever since. I chose horseradish as my second sauce, and adding cheese adds an extra layer of delicious complexion if you are feeling like you want to splurge.   My only complaint is that the amazing experience of eating the sandwich eventually has to end. But alas, all good things must come to an end, that is until my next trip to black camel !"}
{"text":"this is one of my favourite places to eat in toronto. there is only so much time i can go in between eating one of these delicious sandwiches.  i generally get the pulled pork with chipotle mayo and bbq sauce, and if i feel like i need some veggies in my life, adding some coleslaw is ideal.     the meat is incredible (tender with tons of flavour), but the buns that they make these babies on are probably the best part.  Strong enough to hold in the meat, yet still sops up the sauces of your choosing - its perfect.  its a small place which makes it tough to find seating, but there is a park right across the street if the weather is right."}
{"text":"I got the slow cooked beef brisket with caramelized onion and BBQ sauce.  The bun was fresh and delish. The meat was perfectly cooked, very tender. They are very generous with the portions.  Next time I am going to try the creamy horseradish to cut the sweetness.  I ordered my sandwich to go, only took about 5 mins in a very big rush.  I will be back, many more times!"}
{"text":"Literally THE best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had in my life, and I have had great BBQ all over the US. But this pulled pork beats them all, hands down. Perfectly succulent and tender and just SO good. I had the sandwich with mayonnaise and BBQ sauce and caramelized onions and it was just divine. I've been back twice already and look forward to trying out more of their menu. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Super great sandwiches at what felt like a reasonable price.   The service was friendly and efficient. I also liked the atmosphere. Small and quite."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. We've been going here for a few years and they haven't ever disappointed us. Big fan of the steak + onions + chipotle mayo. Their BLT is also pretty good."}
{"text":"Like most people I came here to try the pulled pork. The portion is HUGE and will leave you full and dysfunctional for the rest of the day. I regret having eaten it in one sitting (I had to endure a very sleepy drive home) and I would recommend eating half and taking the rest to go as your next meal. The pork is tender and flavourful and the bun in not overbearing like some other places. Staff are always friendly and drinks are pretty great too."}
{"text":"I'm just padding their stats at this point... :)  It's delicious, fresh, decently priced, the location is super accessible and the staff is extremely friendly.   Can't go wrong coming to this place. Must try in Toronto."}
{"text":"The sandwich hype is real. Based on reviews and word of mouth, we came here on a Saturday around 1:00 PM, and it was very, very busy. The lineup was non-stop, and it looked like many people were coming in to pick up orders as well (so if you don't plan on eating in, call ahead). Overall, an absolutely delicious meal with meat that just melts in your mouth.   First, the parking situation. We first parked on the side streets adjacent to the restaurant, until we realized it was by permit only, so we left in the fear of getting towed (getting towed as a result of hunting down a sandwich shop would have been a pretty embarrassing story). We looked around for free parking but couldn't find any, so we ended up parking at the lot just south of the restaurant (right across from Rosedale subway station), where it's $1.25 every half hour. Lesson learned - take the subway. Or, pay for parking. Whatever works.  Second, the food. It was super messy to eat, but so delicious. We ordered: a) the Pulled Chicken with the Black Camel BBQ sauce and Charamoula Mayo and Roasted Red Peppers, and b) the Slow Roasted BBQ Beef Brisket with more Black Camel BBQ Sauce and Caramelized Onions. You get two sauces with each sandwich, included in the price. Sandwiches are around $7.50 each, and if you want additional toppings like onions, peppers, cheese, etc., it's $0.90 cents each. Overall, a delicious sandwich, albeit very messy to eat. They stuff these buns with meat (honestly, the meat overpowered the bun). The beef melts in your mouth, and was extremely fresh. The chicken actually tasted like chicken (none of that bland, rubbery stuff). The bun was also very soft and chewy, and didn't rub up against the roof of your mouth (don't you hate that?). The Charamoula Mayo was out of this world flavourful (think of a sweet, creamy version of sriracha). Definitely get this as one of the sauces for your sandwich, it'll make your day.  While it looks like a cheap sandwich on the outset, it still adds up once you add toppings. For two people, with tax, we paid around $22."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop in Rosedale. Grabbed a Pulled Pork with Chipotle Mayo, BC BBQ Sauce and caramelized onions... delicious"}
{"text":"I'd been to Black Camel once before and had eaten the pulled pork sandwich and thought it was just okay. But they had just opened at that point, so I've been meaning to give them another shot.  I returned a few days ago and ordered the Slow Roasted Beef Brisket, to which I added the Black Camel BBQ Sauce. First of all, the sauce was so sparingly applied that I could hardly taste it. The meat itself was passable but extremely forgettable. It had been cut into tiny little cubes, which made me think they were trying to hide something. (Was it yesterday's meat, perhaps?)  I got sick of eating it about halfway through, but I'm a pig so I finished it. I doubt I'll ever return."}
{"text":"A.W.E.S.O.M.E.  I've only had the beef brisket and the pulled pork sandwiches there, but on a 5 point scale, I'd rate the beef 5 and the pork 6! (I am partial to pulled pork.)  These are my favourite sandwiches in the city."}
{"text":"It all started with a need to eat on the way to see our dear friends on Belmont street. Getting off at Rosedale meant this curious camel was staring us down as we exited. It was packed. Always a good sign. A quick check revealed the slow roasted beef brisket was a town legend.   The ambience was chill, your corner sandwich shop, like you've been coming here for a quick meal all your life. Simple decor that underlined the food was the highlight, without the need to impress with flashy interiors.   Then the food. Granted we only had one thing, the ubiquitous Slow Roasted Beef Brisket, but that was enough to rave about.   Topped with house BBQ sauce and the Charamoula Mayo, it was made complete with the additional caramelized onions. Mouths watered as we unpacked this beauty and divided it in half. First bite: the mix of textures and flavours brought me home. The brisket was as good as you'd ever imagine. Perfectly roasted, moist but not to the point of a gooey mess, and seasoned masterfully. The BBQ sauce, homey, tangy, the balance between acidity and sweetness leaned toward rich spice notes. The Charamoula Mayo, which they describe as Moroccan inspired with garlic, cilantro, lemon juice, and paprika, brought beautiful balance to the savoury meat and the BBQ sauce. The caramelized onions, were at the exact point of tender and sweet, consistency on point. And holding it all together was what I feel made this a perfect sandwich: the bun. Initially as I picked it up it almost felt to stiff, but after the first bite it all made sense. Bread too soft would just melt into sogginess and fall apart. This held the sauces, and did its job well at that.   Come here. Eat here. Feel that village vibe. The Black Camel shall always be on our must-eat list whenever in TO. All I can say is, I can't wait to eat another one of these sandwiches, and someday, I'll venture on to their other offerings. For now, this sandwich has my heart.   -Luis"}
{"text":"I live a kilometre away. There are very few restaurants in the area. And yet, for some reason I hadn't tried this place.   Well, I rectified that situation recently and boy was I glad I did. Fans of meaty sandwiches need look no further. Both the brisket and the pork are to die for - soft, falls apart in your mouth smooth. Mm! Fresh white floured buns and tasty sauces to finish it off, at a reasonable price and fast too. Patio is nice in summer. Good work, Black Camel, you've won yourself a regular!"}
{"text":"YUM! A tiny gem of a place near Rosedale station. Sandwiches come with your choice of two sauces; additional toppings are extra. The sandwich buns are soft and chewy and make Black Camel's offerings a cut above the rest.  I had the pulled pork with BBQ sauce topped with a vinegary coleslaw. The pork was succulent and flavorful (if a little luke-warm for me) and the BBQ sauce was tangy but a touch sweet on the pork-- it needed another sauce.... thinking now that the horseradish mayo woulda made my sammy perfection. My date had the brisket with BBQ sauce, eggplant, and caramelized onions. His was hot and AMAZING and I would go back and get the exact same thing in a heartbeat. But there are so many combinations to choose from I don't think I'll ever run out of things to try!"}
{"text":"Just headed over to Black Camel to pick up lunch with coworkers. Super excited because it was my first time there. Ordered a pull chicken sandwich with their Black Camel BBQ sauce, chipotle mustard and chilli onions. Prices are fair and the sandwiches are huge. Like, HUGE. Sweet looking location, although a little small.  They have cool loyalty program: eat at the place 12 times and get a free sandwich with your choice of topping.  They've also noticed that people get upset when showing up the place and they're out of a certain dish. To remedy that, they opened a twitter account that's updated by the restaurant so customers can find out if the dish they want is still being made that day. So web 2.0, gawd.  I've taken two large bites out of this beast, and it's awesome. Chewy, juicy, a little tangy and still warm.  Follow @black_camel."}
{"text":"Amazing beef brisket sandwich with a great BBQ sauce (horseradish really rounds it out!) But 8.50 for the basic sandwich without additional toppings? I guess it's chump change if you're living in the Yonge/Rosedale area, but it wouldn't nearly be as successful near student living!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the best sandwich you are going to get in Toronto.   For all those saying the \"hype\" is not real, please. Their bread, meat, toppings are of great quality and ridiculously consistent, something that is hard to come by in Toronto. Plus their staff are always friendly and happy, never snobby.   I would recommend the beef brisket for a hearty hot sandwich and the seared steak for take out as it is tasty at room temp."}
{"text":"When it came time to meet a friend of mine for lunch, he exclaimed, \"I am going to show you the best sandwich in the world!\". He then proceeded to drive an hour and a half from Guelph to meet me here, at the Black Camel.   \"96km for a sandwich?!\", I asked.  \"Just wait until you try it\", he said.  He was right. He was so very right. The Black Camel occupies a closet-sized space just off Yonge at Crescent, directly across the street from the Rosedale subway station. Inside, a chalkboard presents the facts as others have explained here: a choice of meats, sauces, and condiments, slabbed onto a fluffy potato-style bun. In the heart of lunch rush, we waited at most a half hour for our sandwiches once we placed our order. I chose the beef brisket (thanks to all the raves on Yelp), with the house barbecue sauce and chipotle mayo, and carmelized onions and Fontina cheese. Your sandwich includes two fixings--sauces, condiments, toppings--but I was told the slow cooked onions and Fontina cheese were game-changers.  Indeed they were. But most impressive, most delicious, most awe-some of all was the tender, juicy, flavourful barbecue beef. We're in Toronto! Needless to say, I saw Kentucky and Georgia license plates parked outside--because they know what I realized too: this is some of the finest barbecue beyond the U.S. South. The sauces and fixings are all fresh, top notch, and exceedingly tasty.   But this isn't a massive, hulking sandwich. I heard two guys debating \"which two\" they should get--and dismissed it, but realized after eating one, had I been a touch hungrier, I could have easily had two. Fortunately for my expanding waistline and arteries, I was satiated with my one--$8 incredibly well spent--a sandwich I'll be dreaming about and pining to meet again soon."}
{"text":"There is nothing I can say about this place that does it justice. The brisket is actually a life altering experience. The pulled pork tastes like the pig they made it from was fed nothing but the tears of angels. This place is a gem. The staff are good people and the food never misses. Anyone who says otherwise should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves and take a vow of silence because they don't know what they are talking about and are poisoning the rest of us with their lies."}
{"text":"I only discovered this place last November and I have returned 5 times since then.  In those times, I have only ordered their Slow Roasted Beef Brisket, because that sandwich is so good, I don't even want to try their other sandwiches (Although, I really should, since the other sandwiches are probably just as amazing).  The beef brisket is so soft and tender it almost melts in your mouth.  Deciding on which sauces to add to the sandwich is always a really hard decision because all their sauces are that good.  Lately, I have been adding the Charamoula Mayo, and the Creamy Horseradish sauce.  Their service is also excellent, being very friendly and efficient.  I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a hearty and flavourful sandwich, unlike any sandwich you can get anywhere.  If the owners of Black Camel are looking to expand, please consider Mississauga as the next location."}
{"text":"Tried the beef brisket sandwich - large sandwich, quite delicious but nothing out of this world. Tip#1: the combination of sauces and dressings is key to a good sandwich, ask cashier for recommendations if you need them. Tip#2: If you plan on going for lunch, arrive 10 minutes before noon as it gets very busy!"}
{"text":"Steer clear of the chili. It's not very good. Sandwiches are still top-notch."}
{"text":"I recently had the opportunity to try the Black Camel eatery. This is not a restaurant per se and more a takeout style place. The brisket sandwiches were highly recommended and they didn't disappoint. The brisket was tender and properly seasoned, while the accompanied sauce was excellent. The bun fitted the overall sandwich. Coffee was the drink selection and it was poor. Again, no true seating available and the ambiance is nothing to desire.  Enjoy Black Camel!"}
{"text":"Satisfied with my visit! Shop itself has a very nice modern style to it! The staff is extremely friendly! Their main highlight is the brisket and pork sandwiches. Hungry as a wolf, I tried both, and highly satisfied! Very generous portion of meat, and very juicy and saucy! The staff are prepared with lots of napkins! At $13 bucks a sandwich including toppings and a drink, it's a little impractical if you come in hungry! Would definitely try again!"}
{"text":"Amazing brisket. Don't go here after 5 though - you'll get microwaved chili. Come at lunch!!!"}
{"text":"I've eating a lot of burgers lately. So it's likely that I've grown out of the burger phase. Black Camel still managed to impress me nonetheless. This is a ridiculously tiny shop so please do not plan on staying there. The shop can barely contain the crowd that just kept pouring in. With very little selections available, Black Camel is doing well on the few items they offer. I had Beef Brisket Sandwich with Basil Pesto Sauce and Creamy Horseradish. One of my colleagues ordered the same with BBQ sauce. My other colleague got the chili. Although I was happy with my meal, my two colleagues were just indifferent.  Here's what I like about my order: - Stayed in one place instead of falling apart. Lasted till last bite. - At a good balance with flavor. Then again, this will be based on the consumer's personal selection of sauces & condiments. - Good buns - so many shops have been too focused on the meat. You simply cannot offer a good burger with lower end buns. The bun had a good hard exterior, and a very soft and airy inside, which was awesome sponge for the sauces without letting them soak through. - Despite long line up, they were able to quickly service everyone"}
{"text":"Such a great sandwich. Ingredients and toppings were excellent quality and the bread was a really nice bun.  Service was super fast too.  Lived up to the hype!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite sandwich places and maybe the most unique. They aren't the prettiest to look at, but damn do they taste opposite. Whether you like beef brisket, or pulled pork, (personally I recommend their pulled chicken), this place is SO juicy and delicious, and the bread choice is fantastic. I am also excited to say that their breakfast sandwich are probably the best I've ever had. Creamy puffy eggs with Pancetta? YUM! It gets a bit pricey when you add toppings, but if you make the right choices, you are quite rewarded with the taste."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I made it here on my way out of Toronto. They're actually open for breakfast, though they don't have their full menu. Protip is that you can still get their excellent BLT which comes with a tasty though probably too heavily slathered pesto cream sauce. I also tried the breakfast egg/pancetta sandwich that was also quite excellent. Make sure to add some roasted vegetables and onions to your egg sandwich to really make it pop."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town! Had tried the steak, pulled pork, beef brisket, pulled chicken and BLT. We also tried their chili that's also good. Their coffee is a just the right kicker, which is funny, 'cause I found this place as I wanted to have some Americano on a cold winter wait at Rosedale Station. We've been here so many times and I don't see ourselves stopping from doing so. Can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"BEST SANDWICH IN TORONTO.  I love this place. The service is quick and its just good honest food.   BEEF BRISKET: I judge a good sandwich on the bread as well, and this bread works so well with the brisket. Its not that generic bread that you get at BBQ. It's so much better! The brisket is just cooked right. You get two sauces for free but you have to pay for your toppings. The sandwich works out to be around 10 bucks. Which is not bad at all! I got the BBQ sauce, sautee mushrooms and the oven roasted tomatoes!  YUM!! This is my go-to place when I am in Rosedale! This is a must try place, I'm in love!"}
{"text":"There was no lineup and I managed to grab a seat at one of the wee tables inside.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with chipotle mayo and sauteed onions.  It was very tasty, but it was hardly the best sandwich I've ever tried.  I'll likely try others and perhaps my rating will change.  i thought the best thing about the place was the really relaxed sense of family.  I'm not sure if all the staff are related, but they sure acted like they were as comfortable and easy with each other as could be.  It made for a very pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"hm, seems overrated.. doesn't taste bad, but not amazing. tried the beef brisket with two sauces - the bbq and pesto mayo and added in coleslaw for 0.90 cents, which came to almost 10$. really filling as i couldn't finish it. but overall was okie, i guess i'm not big on slow cooked sandwiches. not worth a revisit in my tastebuds"}
{"text":"Amazing beef brisket I got it with their house bbq sauce. So glad we went here it was well worth the walk over here. Wife had the pulled chicken which she loved also"}
{"text":"Had it for lunch at work the other day.   I'll finish this review when I'm done dreaming about their sandwiches. Just go here."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich place in toronto. Get the brisket, with house bbq sauce and chalamoula mayo. Its tangy, rich and savory. The brisket is chopped up and easy to eat. The bun is chewy and fresh. The pulled pork is decent as well, but could be a bit dry sometimes.   They have a certain number of buns each day, so be sure to call ahead before you get there. This is really the only knock on this place. One time I called and they had a few buns left...got there, and the guy in front ordered the last sandwich and I was out of luck."}
{"text":"This place is a place of legend. We exited at Rosedale station looking to go to Canadian tire. We needed material for our business.   As soon as we walked out of the station however our priorities shifted completely. The smell. The smell brought us in. We had no idea where it was coming from so we wandered. Men on a quest.   When we were about to give up, we thought \"maybe it's coming from the convenience store?\" \"No way. Are you stupid?\" And bam. There it was. A shop with no name. Just this camel.   We looked in but we were unsure. Giving it a shot we opened the door. The smell! The smell. There were other items on the menu that day, but we saw nothing but the pulled pork. That was what called us there.   As I bit into my sandwich I almost cried. The soft soft bun. The sweet sauce. The slow cooked meat. The best pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten.   We gave our thanks and walked away, but we both looked back to make sure it didn't magically disappear. One thing was certain that day: we had shared an experience and will never be the same again"}
{"text":"I remember the first time i bit into a Black Camel sandwhich.  I literarly had to put down my sandwhich, pause and actually take a second to embrace how good the fusion of flavours as well as the texture of the beef brisket actually was.    This is a very simple cafe that offers 5 sandwhiches of which two are their specialties: Beef brisket and pulled pork.  I dont eat pork but i must say, the beef brisket sandwhich here is one of the best sandwhiches that i have ever had in my life.  With that said, i've been told that the pulled pork is even better than the beef brisket and so i imagine that's good as well!    The bun is soft on the inside (to the point that it acts as a sponge and soaks up the juices from the actual sandwhich) yet firm enough to keep together until your very last bite.    Black Camel offers the perfect variety of sauces and toppings for these sandwhiches (shown below) and you can tell that they have been very selective with everything on the menu and that they only use the highest quality of products in their foods.  Their BBQ sauce is phenomenal; it is homemade and the one thing i get on my brisket every single time!    Be sure to note that due to the long preperation process of the meats (3 days if im not mistaken), they can and often do run out of sandwhich meat hours before closing time, particularly on a nice day.  If you're coming in from far, you might wanna call in advance to make sure they're open and that they actually have meat.  Also note that this place seats no more than 10 people inside, and maybe 6 outside so its not best to go to with a large group unless you're okay eating out at a near by park.    Also, dont take a date here...unless you plan to woo her with a face full of BBQ sauce and a shirt painted with colourful memories of your first BC sandwhich.    Its about a $10 sandwhich that will fill you up and hit the spot every single time!  When people ask me for a hidden hidden gem city, i point them here!  Enjoy...just try not to tell everyone!"}
{"text":"If you love big hearty sandwiches piled with meat, this is your place!  The sandwiches start at $7 and you choose your own adventure when it comes to the condiments and toppings. The toppings are an extra .90 cents each so if you love your sandwich with extras, the sandwich could end up costing $12 - but well worth it!   I chose the Beef Brisket with Pesto Mayo, cremini mushrooms and caramelized onions. Hands down one of the best sandwiches I've had in the city - the meat was juicy and flavourful and the mayo complimented the sandwich really well. I chowed mine down very quickly!  The shop itself is small and unassuming but it garners big crowds and pumps out big delicious sandwiches. A definite must try for sandwich lovers."}
{"text":"This is a true gem and very very recommended.  The sandwiches are made with love. Everything is good. Beef brisket, roast beef, chicken, vegeterian (red peppers eggplant), it's all good. Even the chili is good.  It's kinda like how italian sandwhiches outshine subway, well Black Camel is along those lines, with lots more than veal and chicken. They have all kinds of meet to choose from, then all kinds of toppings, and then all kinds of spreads. But not a long list where you can't decide - it's just essential good stuff.   Plus i like the fact that you can also buy a San Peligrino Orange - few places seem to serve this favourite drink of mine.  but the best meal is the breakfast eggspresso sandwhich. If you can get there early enough, this is fluffy as hell scrambled eggs (frothed using the expresso whipper) and then served to cure all your hangover needs. Glory.   Also, another cool thing about the place is they have a loyalty stamp program (get your card stamped everytime and then you get a free sandwhich). But whats good is they keep your card (you don't need to carry it on you), so why not? Great service touch."}
{"text":"This place is super cool to me. Love the small shop and the aesthetic to me is really interesting.   The service I got was great- everyone in here has a great attitude and I got very good service.  Got the beef brisket with basil mayo, bbq sauce, and mushrooms. Tried a butter tart too. I had to walk home in the really cold weather with it before I could eat it so unfortunately it wasn't hot anymore when I got home so I missed out on how the sandwich is really supposed to taste. The beef brisket was really yummy and the bread itself was very good without being absolutely amazing. The butter tart filling was absolutely delish and the pastry was just ok.   I'd like to go back and try the pulled pork or the pulled chicken to see what I think of that. Overall this place didn't quite match up to my favourite place for a pulled chicken sandwich (which is not in TO and to be clear I ordered the beef brisket here so maybe not a fair comparison.)  Worth checking out if you're in the area but falls short of being OMG amazing I must have it regularly."}
{"text":"VIBE  It's not as small as I thought. And its across from Rosedale station (not Summerhill...though I appreciated the detour of wine tasting at the local liquor store).  My guess is there are very long line ups at lunch so I opted for dinner time and lucked out to have it relatively quiet.   The staff are super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  Oh, and boy are they QUICK. As in, just as I got my change back my sandwich was made. Holy crap Batman. Literally the first word I put on this review was: Damn.   I ATE  Pulled Pork with porcini mushrooms and bbq sauce. Succulent. Flavourful. Great bun as well.   I'm coming back for the breakfast sandwich on a weekend (and brisket). They make eggs on their espresso machine. Curious.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I think I will now have to call the expression \"Elephant in the Room\" to \"Camel in the Room' to refer to great food.  Now I know what I was missing!  A great once in a blue moon craving place. Especially for Pulled pork. Damn."}
{"text":"Best thing since sliced bread!  Their Twitter account gives a countdown of how many buns are left prior to closing.  Sandwiches are a bit messy but that is just the goodness leaking out!  Chicken club is the best thing on the menu as they have a great pesto mayo.  Pulled pork is also worth a try but chicken club is my favourite."}
{"text":"Cozy little spot right outside Rosedale subway station with a pic of a Camel hanging outside...if you walk too fast you might miss it...but if you're able to find it you are IN FOR it Bigly!  They have limited seating but for the most part is a grab and go type of place. They are known apparently for their delicious sandwiches--- for some reason today I was feeling a bit Vegan -- so I ordered their Roasted veggie, arugula, tomato,eggplant and red pepper sandwich with chipotle mayo from their selection of sauces and boy do they have a selection of sauces for $7.90.  It came out Hot, tasty, their buns are house made, it was delicious!! I also grabbed a blue berry muffin to go. And it was good right to the bottom. No need to eat just top of the muffin here feel free to go all the way down... down town!  Great customer service, delicious food, and yes I went forward and also tipped them Bigly (-;"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich places in this WORLD!  Breathtakingly tasty!  The beef brisket is off the charts! The pulled chicken is absolutely phenomenal as well!  YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM that's all I gotta say.  Sometimes the service can be slow in ordering but when you get the sandwich, you forget about the aggravation of the wait.  The toppings and sauces are so delicious, you will continue licking your fingers lol SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Black camel has become a staple for me, living true to the statement: \"less is more.\"   My favourite has been the camel club with Basil Pesto mayo and black camel bbq sauce, this of course doesn't mean that their other sandwiches aren't good. Everything that I've tried has been wonderful with the Brisket earning a very close second.   The coleslaw and chill also make for a great side.   This place has become a weekly ritual."}
{"text":"Wow...this was good. I was free for a late lunch while sitting in my car ready to head down Yonge from St. Clair and launched the Yelp app. This was what came up and it sounded perfect. It's hard to give a place a fair shake after only one visit or after sampling such a small portion of the menu, but I cannot imagine having anything bad here.  There was a fairly long line when I arrived, but it moved quite quickly. And for me, that gave me a chance to choose my sandwich and toppings, change my mind a few times and end up back where I started, but sure that what I had chosen was the perfect mix for me. In addition to this, I was able to observe the super friendly service given to each and every customer. The person that served me is a Man. United fan and even with me in my Arsenal jersey, I was given great service. We had some friendly banter about the weeks games too.  My chosen sandwich was brisket, with bbq sauce, chipotle mayo, and caramelized onion. It was divine. I was pleased with myself that I chose the perfect sandwich, but obviously, the kudos go to the chefs and the ingredients. The sandwich just melted into my mouth and disappeared in a minute. If I weren't going out for supper in a few hours, I would have turned around and stepped right back into line."}
{"text":"After having heard a lot of good things about this place, I decided to finally try it out! I have yet to be \"wowed\" by a sandwich shop since I arrived in Toronto. Unfortunately, this place was no exception. To be honest, it is quite pricey for what you are paying for. I had gotten the beef brisket with caramelized onions and cheese and it came out to be around $12? I felt like this was a sandwich that I could have either made myself or picked up from the many sandwich places around Toronto. It is a good place to grab something to eat if you pass by, but I would not make effort to come all the way down here."}
{"text":"Stopped in while touring Yonge St around 2pm on Sunday.... Tiny shop with seating for 8-10 people... Ordered Pulled Pork sandwich with BBQ sauce and Chipotle Onions... Waited less than 5 minutes ...Voila my sandwich was delivered to my table...Served on a soft bun... Nice flavours, tender meat and nice sauce, making it a messy sandwich.... Better than average..."}
{"text":"**WARNING** - If any place could turn a former red-meat/pork ingesting carnivore, now part-time vegan back to the gastronomic sins of four-legged flesh, it probably would be Black Camel...um yeah *ducking* as vegan friends throw lettuce at me...haha (nervous laughter) I wouldn''t turn my back on my beloved mammal friends now would I?  Seriously walking past the Camel you can't help your nasal passages becoming spellbound by the ambrosial aromas of whatever's cookin' or grillin' here, it just smells overwhelmingly tempting!  I've only had the veggie and the pulled chicken sandwiches here and oh boy, it's uber-droolworthy I tell ya!  So you get to choose your main filling be it grilled veg, or pulled chicken or pork, beef brisket or steak and you can add toppings like my faves for example being the Sautéed Cremini Mushrooms and Slow-Roasted Roma Tomatoes, and you also get to choose a sauce or condiment for more flavour.   Fair warning prices are steep considering it's not-so-fancy a meal (like 12 bucks for a San Pellegrino can pop + a sammich) wrapped in foil paper, but yo this is Rosedale $12 is like tip money, not even enough for lunch money I guess?    The staff here are always super sympatico and service is pretty swift, but be warned lunch time here is packed!  Often times peeps are lining-up out the door due to the fact the Camel is tiny, like the size of a broom closet, but whatever it's a broomcloset full of mad sandwich flava-love, so I'm not gonna hate :9"}
{"text":"Agree with some of the other members. Went once and had the beef brisket. No additional toppings which I do regret as I think it would have made it a better sandwich. Got the house bbq sauce and Chipotle mayo.   Don't get me wrong it was a reasonably priced sandwich and pretty good taste plus size. However it wasn't \"that\"  special. I think I was missing the toppings. Also tried the vegetarian option but was told it was cold for the grilled veggies. Must have been grilled ahead of time?"}
{"text":"By far the best sandwiches I've had since moving to Toronto about five years ago. This place was suggested to me by a coworker a year ago and I've made the long walk to the small sandwich shop many times since.   Right across the street is a great park to eat your sandwich, which is where I always go.   My personal favorite is the pulled chicken with charamoula mayo (their own concoction), and some arugula. It's heaven in a bun!"}
{"text":"I got the Beef Brisket Sandwich and quite enjoyed it. Wasn't a fan of the fact that for extra toppings, it's 90 cents per topping. The sandwich cost almost $9 with tax itself! I went with a friend and we were miffed that we were short-changed. Not sure how often that happens but we weren't impressed.   Is the sandwich good? Most definitely. Is the cost worth it? Perhaps, though I find it pricey, especially if you want additional toppings. The burger alone can go well up to $20 if you decide to throw on all of their toppings."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are amazing! They are packed with wholly goodness.   I ordered the slow roasted beef brisket sandwich with bbq sauce on the top and the charamoula mayo at the bottom of the bun. I also ordered it with fontina cheese and mushrooms for toppings. The meat itself is so tender and plenty, the buns act as bowls perfectly wrapping the beef.   For the price, it's under $10 and leaves you completely full and satisfied!   I highly recommend it! I have even heard great things for the vegetarian sandwich if you're not into meat."}
{"text":"After lots of good reviews from Yelp and my friends I finally decided to give Black Camel a try. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't blown away either. The service was super friendly and it's immediately apparent why this place is a neighbourhood favourite for many people. I suppose I'm not a big fan of anything pulled, whether it's pork, beef or chicken. That's the only reason why I'm giving Black Camel 3 stars. I much rather prefer a piece of chicken thigh or slices of steak grilled.  Anyway, this place is just not my cup of tea, even though I do acknowledge everything else that's good about it, being friendly service, a warm and casual atmosphere, and good coffee. Even though I won't be back at Black Camel, that shouldn't stop you from trying out their legendary Slow Roasted Beef Brisket or Pulled BBQ Pork Shoulder sandwiches."}
{"text":"Didn't care so much for the seared steak in case someone was planning on getting it. The steak was cut very thin and medium rare but it just didn't taste so good. I'm going to stick with my brisket, because that is awesome!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered their beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches. I guess I had high hopes for the place and it didn't quite deliver.  My pulled pork was a tad sweet after a good few bites, and i didn't even want to finish it at the end. The pork was tender and the bun was alright.  As for the beef  brisket, it was also tender but the taste was quite one dimensional. The last few bites weren't the greatest either."}
{"text":"Got the beef brisket which simply melted in my mouth. Very flavourful but the two sauces they let me choose were kind of overkill. Good price considering the portion size."}
{"text":"The place is tiny, with only 3-4 tables. The menu is written on the chalk board on the top of the wall You can select your meat (e.g., beef brisket, pulled pork) You can select your toppings You can select your sauces The beef briskets are as good as they say. You can get a great meal for under $10 The mango tea is amazing. Service is super duper friendly.  So glad I came."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Love the food+ super friendly service and the coffee is great.   Love the fact that it's open at 7am so I can drop by and get my breakfast fix,- the eggs pancetta sandwich and a cappuccino (best coffee in the area btw...you'd be a fool to go to the Starbucks close by to buy a mediocre coffee at a crazy price). The sandwiches are also all great,- top notch.  If anything I wish they could expand their selection of drinks,sodas etc significantly. Most times I am there I wind up going to the convenience store next door to pick up something..."}
{"text":"The beef brisket sandwich is by farrrrr the best sandwich I have ever had in my life.  Quite large- easy to split with someone."}
{"text":"Best beef brisket in town! The other sandwiches are okay too, and the sauces are great."}
{"text":"Black Camel is a convenient sandwich shop located across the street from Rosedale station. If I'm on the hunt for a hearty, satisfying sandwich, this is usually one of my first stops.  Wait times may vary depending on the lineups, but the service is typically fast and friendly whenever I'm here. It's decorated nicely but they're definitely more of a takeout place. There's enough seating for a few people to be comfortable while others queue for their orders.  Must-try items: Beef brisket (sandwich) Pulled chicken (sandwich) Butter tarts  I'm a big fan of the sandwich buns here, which are served with flavourful, juicy meat that feels like it was slow cooked for a whole day. You get a choice of 2 free sauces, and toppings like red peppers or red onions can be added for about one dollar each.  Half of the fun involves experimenting with the pairing of sauces (chipotle, charamoula etc.) and meats, so be sure to try them more than once before you make a final verdict. The sandwiches go for $7.50 and are well worth it."}
{"text":"It took one sandwich to hook me up to this restaurant, inn and quite an addict to it. Service is fast and the beef brisket is unbelievably tender."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for manwiches made of generous helping of slow cooked meat and a slathering of thick molasses like sauce.    Black Camel keeps it simple. Only one type of bun is available to be stuffed with your choice of beef brisket (most popular choice), steak, pancetta, pulled chicken or pulled pork.   The place is tiny, and considering it is, during brunch anyway, packed with a mini line, seating inside is limited and not very comfortable. There is a patio set available outside or you can grab your sandwich and eat it at Ramsden Park.   The prices range between $7-9, with toppings and sauces sold for extra. The sandwiches are deceptively large and incredibly filling. A degree in civil engineering may help with eating them properly!   If you become a fan, grab yourself a stamp card and join their loyalty program. Every 12th sandwich is free! If you happen to be in the area pre-brunch, check them out for breakfast. They make their eggs with an espresso machine!"}
{"text":"As more and more fast food joints open up, less and less of them are focusing on some of the tastier meals that take time to make such as pulled pork (my favourite sandwich). I've been up and down Yonge Street numerous times and never even knew this place existed. After hearing about this place on the internet (they are even on Twitter as black_camel to tweet about remaining stock of their wares) I decided to stop in. A very small shop with only a few stools and two tables outside during the summer. Nice small menu of things such as pulled pork, briskets, chili and various sandwich specials. If you are in the Rosedale area, this is the perfect stop for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"It's really as good as it gets here at Black Camel. We come here for pulled pork or beef brisket sandwiches. They are heavenly with the spicy mayo sauce. *Salivates* Service is lightening fast and we've never waited for more than 15 minutes. They are right next to Rosedale subway station. They also have a tiny patio outside so take advantage of this in the summer. They also serve coffee but I've never tried. Stick to their strengths: sandwiches! Pro-tip: Grab plenty of napkins before you start chowing down on your sandwich. It's gonna be messy."}
{"text":"After hearing from many friends and yelp reviews that this place has the best beef brisket sandwiches, I had to give it a try. After shopping in the Yorkvile area all morning and having a light breakfast, I was quite excited to finally try this place. The menu is quite simple and not overwhelming which I prefer. Without even scanning the rest of the menu, the choice was quite simple.   I ordered a beef brisket sandwich with black camel BBQ sauce and chili roasted onions. The sandwich finally came and it looked delicious. I have an issue with burger and sandwich places that overstuff their buns to the max; when you take a bite and toppings are oozing out onto your hands, it's not appealing..it's quite the opposite actually. I finally take my first bite and to my surprise, I was disappointed.  1) The bun was served at room temperature. To me the bun is equally important part of the sandwich than the filling. This was a big miss.  2) The BBQ sauce was too overpowering. It wasn't a bad sauce, but that was all I could taste. You could've easily told me I was eating a pulled pork sandwich and I would have believed you. The brisket didn't stand out in any way.  3) The bun to meat ratio was too high. I love my breads, but this one wasn't even good and there was just too much of it and not enough meat in my opinion. Maybe I should've opted for some extra toppings, but a good sandwich should stand out on its own and this one to me fell short.   Overall, I think I will be back to try their other sandwiches as people seem to quite enjoy them. But I will not be going out of my way to visit this place."}
{"text":"Stepping into the tiny space Black Camel inhabits on a weekend afternoon, I was surrounded by rich Rosedale kids who were talking loudly to one another about how they were playing tennis 2 hours a day and jetsetting to Florida for the weekend. There was nowhere to sit and a line nearly out the door on a freezing cold winter day. Regardless, it was all totally worth it.   I had the veggie sandwich ($7) -- a tasty combination of Roma tomato, red pepper, arugula, and eggplant -- with the addition of caramelized onions ($0.90) and pesto mayo. SO GOOD. I like how the buns are soft but chewy, avoiding the potential pain induced by a sharp toasted bun jabbing the roof of your mouth. I like how the sandwiches themselves are fairly substantial, meaning that for less than the cost of a tiny burger at Burger's Priest, you can fill up on a delicious sandwich that WON'T clog your arteries! The menu on the website states that you get your choice of one sauce, but the menu board at the Black Camel reads two.   The bad: the system seems a bit inefficient here...you place your order and pay at the counter, and then awkwardly stand around waiting for someone to come out and deliver your sandwich to you. The girl at the counter seemed majorly frazzled when I was there, and she gave back the wrong change and messed up the order. Also, parking around here is a bit of an inconvenience, and since the space is so small it's hard to find a place to sit when it gets busy (and does it ever). Also, rich Rosedale kids. But! The sandwiches are still totally worth it."}
{"text":"THE BEST PULLED PORK SANDWICH OF MY LIFE!!  To quote Dave O. you will have \"happy belly\" after eating here.  The camel is a pretty nondescript place.  The sign just has a picture of a camel and says \"cafe\" and \"sandwiches\".  I have run past this little gem countless times thinking it was just some deli sandwich shop. WRONG!  This is probably the best kept secret of Rosedale.  The pork is so moist and tender and the buns are perfectly balanced to melt in your mouth yet still be firm enough to keep from falling apart in your hands.  For $7.00 with your choice of sauces and only $0.90 to add a topping this is a great deal.    The customer service is good too with the quirky barista/order yeller."}
{"text":"OK- update needed. I have been coming to the camel now  since its inception (on adelaide) over 5 years ago, HOW i managed to overlook the seared steak on the menu I DO NOT KNOW! but I am forever grateful for the girl ahead of me that ordered it for not for her I never would have uncovered this gem of a sandwich. Succulent, Cold (yes cold) seared steak, so damn good, what I enjoy about it is its light-ness in comparison to the beef brisket (great, but heavy). Try it, with tomatoes charamoula and mustard. hmm"}
{"text":"Very close to Rosedale station so we decided to try it out.  Tiny place but great menu.  Its great if you feel like something quick to eat that isn't your typical dirt fast food like McDonald's or Burger King.    Some of the menu items were pulled pork, beef brisket, pulled chicken etc.  There were lots of sauces and condiments to add on. Each sandwich was 7 dollars which is fine for the size of the sandwich.  I do however think that at least 1 topping should be included in that price instead of paying an extra 90cents for each topping (arugula, caramelized onions, tomato, etc.)  ANYWAY the sandwich was terrific.  Definitely a good pulled pork sandwich.  Lots of meat and full of flavour.  Will def try out the brisket and chicken on another day."}
{"text":"I order sandwiches from here through UberEats all the time and they are DELICIOUS! My fave is the seared steak with horseradish mayo, mushrooms and arugula. Each bite is so satisfactory. It also helps alleviate a killer hangover. YUM"}
{"text":"Gone twice to try the beef brisket. It's average at best. There is nothing especially good about it. Chili is subpar."}
{"text":"The best things in life are NOT free, but they ARE (deceptively) simple.   Black Camel's sandwiches belong on such a list.   Anyone who knows what the best Little Portugal sandwiches taste like (think a Dufferin and Dundas pit stop) will appreciate this eatery. It had me dreaming of BBQ smears and Saturdays in the old 'hood.    I had the pulled pork  sandwich with BBQ and chipotle sauce + caramelized onions + fontina cheese. No soda needed, just water to accompany an awesome 'wich.   Add friendly staff and you've got a winner.   I was super pleased with my pulled pork but   I RECOMMEND: the beef brisket instead. Had a bite of someone else's and the difference was clear with beef in the clear lead. Explosive taste.  EXTRA TIP- they have amazing breakfast sandwiches too for those in the area. See my pics for the chalkboard menu! But whatever you get, be prepared to take it to go. The place is small so not ideal in peak hours."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Visiting Black Camel gives me this sweet, warm and fuzzy feeling..  Maybe because I am sharing a Slow Roasted Beef Brisket with Black Camel BBQ Sauce ($7) and Caramelized Onions with my Yelp friend?  Maybe because my sandwich has all these sweet items... sweet BBQ sauce and the caramelized onion, even the beef was soft and sweet..  Maybe it is just a nice and sunny day...   For sure I know is the staffs are super sweet and cheerful. The patrons here are polite and friendly.  Maybe next time I need to have a cup of their coffee, seems like the whole neighbourhood are getting one to go before hopping on the subway or have a walk in the park across the street!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Delicious beef brisket! Their signature sandwich is beef brisket with BBQ sauce and caramelized onion!"}
{"text":"Go here if you want a tasty pulled pork or beef brisket sandwich! For $8.00 tax-in.  Only seating for 10 people or so!  If you're on the subway, you can run from and back to Rosedale station quick.  Sandwiches are a little runny, may not be the best for walking and eating."}
{"text":"I wasn't even planning on eating at Black Camel. But after emerging from Rosedale subway station (and how many times does that happen), I saw that ebony dromedary beckoning me. Is it time for a sandwich? I looked at my watch: yes, it was meat o'clock.  Service is incredibly friendly. A spunky (why not?) girl behind the counter cheerfully greeted me before I was halfway through the door. When my eyeglasses fogged up she suggested a simple remedy (\"walk in backwards\") but I wasn't falling for it. Though the dewy lenses I gleaned that the Black Camel is a unbelieveably tiny spot. There is only one table that seats two. Others have to sit on a stool at a marble-topped counter, or GTFO.   When I asked what was good, the answer came quickly without hesitation: beef brisket with caramelized onions. Done. By the time I settled into a window seat, that badboy was ready -- wrapped in paper. Was it good? MOUTHWATERINGALLY. It meat was tender, the onions deliciously sweet, and the bun kept it all together with panache. I tore into that sandwich so vigorously it could have pressed charges. Damn.  Anyway, come here for a bite. It's awesome. Can't wait to try some other options.  Obligatory Title Pun: This HUMP ain't dry.  Menu Readability: Beautifully written chalk lettering. At least, from what I could tell through my glasses.  Need to mention: They take debit and credit cards.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'll throw down and eat brisket any time of day."}
{"text":"Service: The service was speedy. I was in and out in no time.  Ambiance: It's a really small sandwich shop that tailors to the lunch crowd. Seating is really limited. Most people take it on the go. If you are in a rush during lunch, you better go early to avoid the long line.  Food: The beef brisket sandwich is a staple. You can't go wrong with this. The brisket is tender and you can pair it with two different sauces for free (additional sauces cost more). The brioche bun also compliments the sandwich by just soaking up all the flavours."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich shop! It's located just outside the Rosedale subway station so it's easy for a quick meal and then you can hop back onto the subway and be on your way. This place is meant for pick up or a quick sit down meal. There's only a few seats available outside and inside. The beef brisket is excellent and lives up to the hype - it's also a messy sandwich so get lots of napkins!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service, friendly staff.  What more could you ask for? The shop is small and lovely, very bright, always bustling with people. They have a nice little patio to sit on in summer months, but get there early, it's a popular spot.  It's close to our office, and we have ordered there at least twice a week for the last three weeks in a row.  There's always a big lineup, but it moves quickly and the staff get the orders out so fast.  Definitely worth waiting in line for."}
{"text":"You know you've been going to a place too much when you walk in & the guys know your order!  The Black Camel does things right - they keep it simple. There's no confusion - pick your meat, pick your sauces, pick your condiments - done.   You're usually in and out of there within 5 minutes (unless you go there during the lunch rush, which can get pretty heavy!).  The beef brisket is out of this world, and I usually pair it with horseradish and their in-house BBQ.   Great spot for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I was a visitor to Toronto, staying with friends in the neighborhood. Back in NY I work up the street from Dinosaur BBQ so I have high standards for BBQ fare.  While praising the black camel to one of its employees and comparing it favorably to Dinosaur, I was swiftly corrected and made to understand that the Black Camel is not BBQing or Smoking their meats.  They are offering SLOW ROASTED brisket and pulled pork.  No matter-  The meat, the bread, the condiments, including the homemade BBQ sauce are WONDERFUL!!    I had brisket, served on amazing bread, with BBQ sauce, arugula and horseradish sauce.  Scrumptious!  Just super delicious!!  Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Good but not the best beef brisket I've had. Not bad prices but a bit cheap on how much meat they give you. Compared to other restaurants of this style I've been to the meat portions were about half the size. Bun was great and the staff was very friendly. Girlfriend really enjoyed the BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"All I can say is go try it yourself you won't be disappointed the food speaks for itself. The amount of hard work they put into preparing their food is clearly evident. COMPLETELY FRESH.   I Haven't had anything like it before. I tried the Roast Beef Brisket with Caramelized Onions ($0.90 extra) Chipotle Mayo, & Black Camel BBQ sauce.  Staff is really really friendly!"}
{"text":"An UNBEATABLE pulled pork experience! Pulled pork with the BBQ sauce AND the horseradish sauce, topped with caramelized onions on the PERFECT bun. Don't bother with the coleslaw however, nothing special."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I had the Chicken BLT and added Fontana cheese. I don't think I had a chance to breath before I inhaled it! My boyfriend had the pulled pork that was equally as good. We will definitey be going back here and have already recommended it to friends."}
{"text":"I always get the pulled pork sandwich with Black Camel BBQ sauce, caramelized onions, and chipotle mayo. I never try anything else because I know I've found THE BEST :D When they're out of pulled pork, I substitute it with the brisket, but nothing beats my porky! I'm collecting the stamps to get my free sandwich. Four more to go :D"}
{"text":"Small sandwich shop with a menu size that matches. Not many seats available so it would be a good idea to avoid lunch rushes or either get the sandwich to go. If the weather is nice out, enjoying the sandwich across the street at the park would be a good idea.  Beef brisket was tender and moist. Toppings are a definite must to make the sandwich even better. The BBQ sauce was sweet but mixing it with the chipotle mayo would give the sauce and sandwich an extra dimension. Had a bite of a sandwich with the basil pesto mayo and that was surprisingly delicious with the meat. The sauces were all very flavourful and went well with the sandwiches. The bun was lacking something to make this sandwich even better but it held its shape fine.  Overall, will definitely come back to try the other sandwiches and possibly the chili."}
