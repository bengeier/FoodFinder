{"text":"Not bad for a drink or two if your with your friends. Nice service. Crowd can be bad. Security has no clue how to react to situations or speak to paying, well behaving patrons."}
{"text":"The food here was not good.  
There were three of us for lunch, food was cold und under-cooked. Bucket of bacon was cold, and not crispy. Calamari was served cold, soggy, and under-cooked. Pizza, steak sandwich, and macaroni were ok, but all a little lack lustre. Although one doesn't exactly go to a pub for a cup of tea, this establishment doesn't have any tea at all.  Weird."}
{"text":"Bucket of Bacon...Need I say more?? 

Ok, this place is really good; friendly service (pretty too), and the food was actually top shelf (their thin crust pizzas are legit and reasonably priced) and the place looked well maintained and comfortable. I think though it suffers from looking like every other pub that's out their, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it is what it is. I went during lunch on a Thursday and this place was deadville, so I had low expectations but was pleasantly surprised. Wonder what  it like in the evenings, during the playoffs?

If you find yourself in Airdrie and hungry, give it a try."}
{"text":"Really great food and service. Not sure why I haven't been here sooner. The wings are nice and crispy, the nachos are gigantic! You can't go wrong with a bucket of candy bacon! Will become a regular."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time yesterday. Went at 1pm on a Wednesday and the place was dead( I love shift work) 

Beer was great, had a schooner. Most of the beers on tap I have tried before but I will return to try some more. Also had a BLT and fries. Great food was the opinion  from my group."}
{"text":"We stopped in the first time in summer for a beer just to wait for the shuttle to the Airdrie Rodeo... which met in front, and were pleased at the selection on tap. I recently ended up back here for lunch, after working outside for the morning in -34 weather and had the Craft Dinner....  WOW!  In the menu it is described thus: \"Maplewood smoked bacon, chorizo sausage, mozzarella, cheddar, jack cheese, jalape√±o, frizzled onion, and garlic toast.\" It sounded good to me, but didn't look like anything fancy, honestly. The blend of textures and flavours was a surprise, presenting and tasting like quite the masterpiece  when I thought I was just ordering a standard (see what I did there?) pub comfort dish to combat the cold weather, and I will definitely order it again. The servers were pleasant.  In summer, with the garage doors open, it is breezy and pleasant, and on this visit it was warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a quick bite before the matinee at Crossiron Mills, this was just the ticket on a Friday afternoon day off. The place was virtually empty except for one other table so we grabbed a table by the garage door windows, awesome when the weather is fine and the windows are rolled up, as close to patio as you get.

Beer selection is good and the food was too.

So nice to get another local pub in Airdrie that serves some decent pub grub."}
{"text":"A nice selection of beer on tap and in bottle, few wines. The food was good and our server had some good insight into the menu. Only a few local breweries on tap and a bummer is there is only one dessert on the menu.

A lot of televisions to watch sports and it was a bit empty on a Saturday evening.

Overall a nice place to grab a beer and some good food."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. 
Order the \"Bucket of Bacon\" for and appetizer, really how can you go wrong,  a bucket of bacon! Awesome! The bacon was thick slices and cooked, than covered with a brown sugar type candy coating. It was great.

The rest of the meal was likewise good, and well prepared, but it really is a bar / pub. So there were not a ton of choices on the menu. 

The offererd several beers on tap and promoted some local breweries.

All in all not a bad experience"}
{"text":"Very impressive!

Surprisingly amazing food, great service, good beer selection, definitely the best of its kind in Airdrie. It's a good place for singles, but I find the beer can be sometimes warm..."}
