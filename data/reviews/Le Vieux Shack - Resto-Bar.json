{"text":"Really great place to take a beer on a terrace during the summer. They have a really comfy outdoor furniture.  They also feature a lunch buffet during the week (Which I haven't attended) and an all you can eat Sunday brunch that is really great!  They showcase some music and comedy shows and they are also a bar and a sport bar during hockey season.  So quite versatile!"}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner, not a lot of people. We were about 3 couples to eat and maybe 5 people at the bar. It wasn't the best experience that I ever had. The waitress was talking about her private life at the bar and it was a bit awkward. Talking about her sex life and we found a hair in our sandwich. It make me gag and didn't want to finish my burger. We had our coke and I found it pricy for less than a 250ml coke. The fries wasn't the best and the burger was okay. The waitress was a bit drunk and was taking a lot of shots, the moment when we entered and the time we got out, she took at least 4 shots. Yeah .. and the service was a bit long."}
