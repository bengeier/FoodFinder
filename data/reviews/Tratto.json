{"text":"The food was spectacular, Our server, Maria, was fantastic. I am somewhat limited in what I can eat but I ate all 4 courses and loved them. Amazing what they do with simple ingredients. Honest, unpretentious gourmet food. The wine menu is fantastic as well serving great bottles of local Arizona vineyards and nice Italian wines as well, You know it is a hot spot when other local chefs and restaurants are sitting among st you."}
{"text":"Enjoyed some of the food very much.  Some missteps though for a restaurant with such a reputation.  Olive infused gin martini and lemon bruleed tart were actually awful.  So was the coffee!  And I'm dismissing the mix up with our order.  At these nosebleed prices, they need to get more of it right.  I also find the pasta and entree selections limit of just two each to be ridiculous."}
{"text":"I live in Chicago and visit Scottsdale in the winter. I went to Tratto in Phoenix on Saturday night, 2/4, there were 3 of us and we were excited to go. I've eaten at Pizzeria Bianco 2 years ago and still talk about it. At Tratto, we could not get a reservation 10 days ahead and that really said so much to me. We went anyway and were lucky, we got 3 seats at the bar, totally fun!  I'm a lifelong restaurant guy and I understand that kind of demand. I completely respect all that Chris and his teams are doing. Then the big smiles, the hospitality, the knowledge each and every staff member has is spot on and sincere. Cool little restaurant, designed to feed your senses with simple yet detailed atmosphere, the menu changes slightly and is small, it helps the decisions so just have one of everything...no kidding, experience it all and the depth of flavors in the food and cocktails. Great wine list, only quality wines...you pay for quality and I was so happy to see that they don't overprice themselves, they are fair with the pricing.  Chris is a treat to meet...one of the most interesting and passionate guys I've come across in our business. I talked to him and had a great conversation. Knowing the level of knowledge, talent and desire to do GREAT food, in itself is worth 5 stars on Yelp...anyone who works hard, is caring and sincere towards their customers and has that \"desire and passion\" understands all that Chris and his team put into these restaurants. I am a life long fan...my interests are in finding and enjoying great restaurants, I must say, I look to feed my creativity and got so much inspiration from eating at Tratto. Good luck Chris, thank you for the great meal and conversation, I will be spreading the word about your restaurants and will be bringing my team to your restaurant's soon. Cheers to all of you! Michael"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Tratto twice  in the last week. We are visiting from out of town.  We sat at the bar both Visits.  We were so impressed.  The bartenders Blaise and Eddy were fabulous.  They were warm, engaging but not intrusive.  Their knowledge of the menu was impressive.  They made recommendations of wine and food that were spot on!  We also had the pleasure of meeting Chris Bianco!  He seems to have a great relationship with his staff that shows in their actions.. I haven't mentioned.....the food was wonderful!  The pate, the  farenata.....and we had a citrus creme brûlée pie was delicious.  So good in fact we ordered both to take home on Friday!! Love this place....wishing them great success!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It was small, intimate, and beautiful. My husband and I ate about 60 percent of the menu every dish we tried was fabulous. We started with the chicken liver and cranberry bruschetta, Firnato, salad with walnuts and grapes, then the pasta Cavatelli with short ribs, and the roasted chicken. Everything was absolutely delicious. The pasta and chicken were our if  this world. If you order the chicken I would ask for a double on the pan air jus!! It was so delicious I could drink a pint of it they brought me bread to use as a dipping vessel.   We had a wonderful bartender I wish I could remember his name who was so informative and extremely personal. He also made the eggnog it was on believable and typically do not like eggnog. Because the food was so delicious my pictures were an afterthought and little blurry perhaps due to the spectacular cocktails we had which were the old fashions"}
{"text":"Everything is just wonderful, from service to decor to food. More vegetarian main dishes would be nice......"}
{"text":"All the five star reviews below are right on!  We went there this evening and had food you can only expect from a James Beard award-winning chef. Chris was right there enjoying cooking and chatting with his guests. There were four of us and we chose to order a variety of dishes and share. Each dish was better than the last. It is a small and intimate environment which only seats about 30. It won't be easy to get into this 5-star spot as the word spreads!"}
{"text":"Menu changes to reflect seasonal produce; best selection of amaro in Phoenix.  Solid selection of wine by the bottle.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I was there a few days ago and had a focaccia with lardo as an appetizer and baked eggplant. Delicious!! All pastas are made in house and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time reading reviews.....really.  If you are so lucky to get reservations, just go.  You will not be disappointed.    If you are still reading,  well.....we were there last night and had an AMAZING experience.  Tratto is just the sort of place we have come to expect from Chris Bianco.  It is understated and down to earth, staffed with a retinue of extremely efficient and polite wait staff, and a casual ambience that allows diners to focus on the food.  The food was top notch and the combination of flavors, textures, and tastes was really extraordinary.  It is well known that Chris is a magician with his pizzas but this is an entirely different genre where he excels just as well.  What I really liked was the lack of pretentiousness and the down to earth feel of the place where the central characters were the dishes streaming out of the kitchen.  Chris and his crew really know their vegetables.  We are vegetarians and I can honestly say that we did not have to make any compromises with respect to expectations or diversity of food that was served.  The farinata was outstanding - crispy on the outside with marinated olives and slices of okra burnt just right.  The cucumber and celery root salad with a creamy vinaigrette completed the appetizer course.  The care that the crew had taken even in slicing the celery root and cucumber, infusing it with just right amount of creaminess so as to allow the vegetables to shine, makes for an outstanding starter.  The bread was to die for and arrived warm and fluffy with just the right chewy, rich brown exterior.  We had the ricotta tortelli accompanied by a delectable yellow tomato sauce (pasatta gialla?) for the main course.  This dish exceeded all my expectations and more.  It was easily the best pasta I have ever tasted (consistency, texture and 'mouth feel') ....the creaminess of the ricotta paired brilliantly with the tarty sweetness of the sauce.  This primi selection was indeed in a league of its own. Typically, the contorni are an afterthought but here they vie for rock star status.  We found the sliced eggplant with onions and basil outstanding.  Crisped just right with a sprinkle of rock salt and tomato so as not to overwhelm the dish.  The unsung hero among the contorni choices was the spinach.  You will never believe that ordinary spinach can be made to taste so extraordinary just coaxed with some garlic and olive oil.  Not done yet.....don't miss the crostata - apple with vanilla cream sauce.  The buttery flakiness of the crust complemented the unassuming crispy melange of sweet and tart from the apples drenched in a dollop of divine vanilla cream.  Of course, at that point in the meal, Chris had us believing in miracles.  Chris Bianco, I am grateful that you allow mere mortals like me to taste culinary brilliance that so few restauranteurs can ever hope to reach.  We walked out of the place only after we made repeat reservations.......for December."}
{"text":"Really liked the restaurant and it deserves acclaim, although it's pricier than Yelp would have you believe.  The food, however, was delicious and the service was really good too.  The menu is not overbearing, and from what I understand changes frequently, but it's genuinely Italian. Indeed, you won't find a more authentic Italian dining experience in Arizona.  I'd have given the place 5 stars, but I think the menu should also include some kind of seafood option.  We had the tortellini, which comes in an amazing sauce and is probably a \"must try\" dish, and the chicken which was delicious as well as the grilled zucchini with mint.  It was really good too.  Kudos also goes to the bar, which had a nice selection of delicious cocktails ."}
{"text":"Yawn.  The food was not interesting nor was it really good.  If you have to have Bianco, go to the pizzeria next door.  If you want really good small plates with an Italian bent, go to Crudo instead -- MUCH better on all counts."}
{"text":"Tratto has been one of my best culinary experiences in a long time.  In a gastronomic landscape of chains and celebrity chefs that pay more attention to their branding than their offerings, tratto is a beacon of deliciousness.  From the unassuming decor to the impeccable service, Tratto walks the fine line of fine dining without tilting toward pretension.  For cocktails we had the mezcal blueberry cocktail, which was smoky yet sweet and quite enjoyable.  We also had the VDK which could use some work in comparison, not as inspired or innovative.  The farinata starter was amazing, I have yet to see farinata outside of the west coast of Italy, and it was one of the best I'd ever had.  The onion and roasted sage were a perfect and welcome addition.  The true star of the evening was our primi dish, the Tortelli pisatta gialla.  Perfectly prepared, and the cherry tomato sauce with the ricotta was superb.  For a secondi we shared the Pork shank alla Milanese, which was hearty and literally fell right off the bone.  Chris Bianco has created yet another amazing dinning experience, and in my book, his best yet."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Arizona.  The farinata is a must have.  Great food and great atmosphere.  If I could change one thing, I would ask for larger plates for the secondi course.  Patrons are encouraged to dine family style, which I enjoy.  But the secondi course is a little difficult to eat on the smaller plates.  Other than that, fantastic experience."}
{"text":"I dined here with two of my friends on April 1st.  Since none of us had ever been here, we were excited to try it.  This restaurant exudes an elegant simplicity, which I enjoyed.  But it got very loud in there and I couldn't hear the conversation if someone was not speaking directly at me.  The food was absolutely delicious but over-priced.  Since we dine at very nice restaurants, we have a good base to compare Tratto with.  There were at least 2 pork dishes on the menu that night and since I don't eat pork, I ordered the chicken.  This was $38 and should be more like $28.  My friends also believe that it is over-priced.  The most annoying thing--our waiter suggested to us at least 3 times to order several dishes and go \"family style\" despite the fact that we told him \"no\" to the option the first time he asked.  With prices like this, nothing more than once is necessary.  I got the feeling they were just trying to push food.  With the prices being high, noise level, and annoyance of the waiter, we will not be returning.  The food is, however, very flavorful."}
{"text":"How this place only has 4 stars is absolute blasphemy. I've been several times and it's always amazing. Just let Chef cook for you, don't even look at the menu. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My roomie and I went here a couple weeks ago since we'd heard all of the rave reviews. We got a seat at the bar as a walk in, which was lucky. Definitely get reservations as the dining area is very small. We had the chicken liver pate, which was quite tasty, and the porkchops, which were truly HUMONGOUS. We split the porkchops and couldn't finish them. It was truly a gargantuan portion. You are getting bang for your buck with the porkchops and it was delicious - seared to perfection, juicy, fatty on the edge.   Service at the bar was great. All of the servers were pleasant, attentive without being overbearing and were very knowledgeable. Will wait for their menu to turn over before we make another visit!"}
{"text":"We had high expectations for Tratto after reading the recent review in the newspaper - perhaps too high.  Although the food was very good, it wasn't exceptional.  The lettuce salad with aged parmesan shavings was very fresh and good and large enough for two to share.  The bread service was excellent - both french bread and sliced focaccia with olive oil.  The tortellini were large and tender in spots and al dente in others, with a rich cream/yellow tomato sauce.  A serving contained 7 tortellini which was about right for one person.  Another person in our party had a breaded, pounded pork chop with a butter sauce and really enjoyed it.  The negatives:  the menu is very short (not a lot of options), service was rather slow even though they weren't completely full early on a Wednesday night, and wines by the glass are very expensive.  We enjoyed it, but didn't feel it was worth the hour drive to go back."}
{"text":"I loved the simple menu. Any time you see such a slimmed down menu you know everything will be top notch. Tratto has a different vibe from the pizzeria, in a good way. I would definitely recommend this place to many friends and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Everything on menu was wonderful - Word to the wise - be careful - be aware when ordering glass of red wine - no call- When I looked at bill I discovered the glass of no call to be $30 - just word of warning / heads up !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food and great cocktails. I'll say that the owner of this place is lucky to have the people working for him that he does, especially the bar manager- super knowledgeable about what he's doing, clearly had a passion for it, owns it and takes pride. As a business owner, that's all you need to make a place successful and he certainly has that. The food was fantastic as well. Amazing experience and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Kate J who gave a 2 star review is a schmuck. This place is amazing. I could care less if the chef talked to me or not (which he did btw). Seriously the absolute best pasta I've ever eaten. This place is better than Rockys deli."}
{"text":"My husband booked dinner for two at Tratto for my birthday.  The food was rich and delicious.  It is a small restaurant, tucked away in a strip mall, with a \"Rustic Farmhouse Chic\" decor.  They offered creative cocktails and an even more creative dinner menu.  The Chef offered a complimentary sampling of olives, cheese, and organic baby vegetables to begin our dinner.  We enjoyed the summer squash antipasti, flatbread appetizer, lamb ragu pasta, and Pork chops with apples.  The squash antipasti was a show stopper.  It was rich, creamy, and luxurious and the organic vegetables were perfectly cooked.  The lamb pasta was a great mix of flavors and textures, and the pork with apples was prepared in a butter sauce that was absolutely fantastic!  Our server was very professional and attentive.  He explained that the portion sizes were quite large so we decided to share the meal.  When the pork arrived there were 4 thin cut chops on the plate!  We ended up taking a doggie bag home."}
{"text":"After reading a few articles in the Phoenix New Times and AZCentral, I knew that a quaint restaurant by Chris Bianco would be the perfect place for an early romantic dinner on a Friday night. I called and left a message for a reservation which was promptly returned.  Tratto, a simpler version of Trattoria, is an understated Italian restaurant that has placed the kitchen front and center with Chris at the helm.  We arrived and were seated in a quiet alcove, perfect for conversation and people watching. Kate selected a glass of Poggio Pinot Noir, blackberry and jammy, while I opted for a more full bodied Cabernet / Sangiovese blend. Both were excellent pairings for the evening of delectable dining.  Before we ordered our meal, we asked Jairo for a few recommendations and he was knowledgeable of each ingredient and conveyed it well.  He retrieved an amuse bouche of green olives, lightly sautéed green beans with garlic, and a few slivers of soppressata.  This small offering defined the meal that we were about to enjoy, simple, fresh, unassuming and authentic.  The first course were warmed beets with a blue cheese sauce served on fig leaves.  Delicious.  Next was the Eggplant. Sliced thin, sautéed in olive oil, garlic and then served with a hint of mozzarella, fresh basil/garlic/olive oil pesto and a tomato. This is a must try for everyone!  For our entrees, we shared the Chicken and the Strozzapretti hand-rolled fresh pasta. The small pan-seared chicken was served along with the pan-drippings of the succulent salty oils and I used bread to sop up as much of this delicacy that I could. Again delicious. The Strozzapretti was in a creamy tomato sauce that needed no additional cheese or flavoring. Sublime.  At the end of our romantic feast, it was agreed that we will return again and often. I can see why Chris had said that this restaurant was the culmination of his life's work, that everything led to this point. We are patrons of Pane Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco, and now we can add Tratto to the list of great places to dine within a 10 minute drive from Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"As you walk in the door.... seems smallish but very well appointed. Note, I was highly skeptical however, I was committed with a party of seven. The service would and does match anything you would find in very fine dining. (I didn't know this was fine dining yet).  The first course of salads and assortment of cheeses and fruit combined with olives start the dining experience. From there it only got better with the multitude of courses with taste sensations that would delight any pallet.  The service.... perfection. The ambience... perfection. The dining experience.... fabulous."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my Son 2 nights ago. We didn't have a reservation and walked into an empty restaurant around 5:30-6pm, the hostess said we were welcome to sit at the bar...again the place was empty! We sat at the bar (we were now the ONLY 2 people at the bar!) the bartender asked us to move over one stool since they liked to keep seats in pairs...I laughed and said what if a single person sat would they be allowed??? The vibe so far was terrible..I live in NY and eat at the finest restaurants and have never been asked to sit on a particular bar stool! My Son and I laughed it off and ordered our drinks...delicious and then our dinner which was also very good.  Lessons in hospitality would be HIGHLY recommended, not a place I'd be in any hurry to return to!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best meals I've had in Phoenix. The fit out is great and the space has a good energy to it. The food is off the charts good, the wine was unique and on point with the food, and the service was attentive and friendly. As some other reviews have pointed out, it is pricey, but it's a steal for the quality of food you're getting. Great for a special occasion or date night out."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited 30 minutes before close on Saturday night and were thrilled with our experience. The dining room is intimate and cozy. The staff is extremely attentive and professional. Great wine selection - just the right size menu to accompany the small seasonal food menu. Oh, and the food...we had the focaccia, cucumber and melon salad, both pasta dishes, the roasted butternut squash and the cheese board for dessert. Everything was crafted to perfection. So much care went into every detail - although it was a side the squash was one of our favorite items.   Great job again! We will be back."}
{"text":"Anyone giving this food a bad review has no idea what real Italian food is. Olive Garden may be more their speed. Tratto serves exactly what you would find in Italy - high quality ingredients prepared simply but with skill and care, every bite bursting with deep, soulful flavor. The double-cut pork chop evokes Bistecca alla Fiorentina served in Tuscany. The bolognese with handmade pasta is as authentic as it gets, with the same layered and comforting flavors I found in Bologna. The chicken liver pate rivals any foie gras that I've had in fine dining French restaurants.   The staff gave us great service with just the right amount of attention. It was obvious they were proud of the food they were serving, and deservedly so. Those complaining that they were seated slowly after arriving with no reservations may prefer dining at the Spaghetti Factory. Tratto is a small boutique restaurant offering a more gourmet experience, not an assembly line of canned faux-Italian food. It's just common sense - don't come to a place like this without reservations and pretend it's the restaurant's problem.   The menu is deceptively simple, as I mentioned before, but that describes most authentic Italian food. That means there are no flashy tricks to hide behind and everything must be executed perfectly. Not a problem here. They apply an uncommon level of care to every dish, and it shows in every bite   This is easily one of my top five favorites in the valley. I will be back soon with friends and family."}
{"text":"Stranded in AZ due to AA trying to book it too tight.  Googled james beard AZ.  Called from the doubletree in tempe to see if I could squeeze in before they closed.  It was a photo finish arrival on paper yet they insisted that I come++.  I showed up in thrid place two minutes after close.  I was welcomed in, and opted without suggestion, for the bar.  Blaise was my guy.  I ordered the white negroni as it had that apertif-y kind of thing going.  The food menu is structured exactly as it appears on yelp on the bazillion pics that show up at the top of the page.  Anti, pasta, protein, sides.  I let blaise cut the trail and was perfectly pleased.  The portions are beyond fair.  I ordered the squash, a pasta and the carrot side.  It was perfect.  Im stuffed.  The dishes were clean and simple.  The finishing was proper subtle even on the carrot which was sweet and thus in danger of landing under salted.  It was the only dish where i noticed the salt, and that was only because i wanted so bad for it to be there; it came with crunch.  I have had a lot of homemade pasta, and this pasta is on point.  I only use yelp as a tool to evaluate value perception as i am in the industry.  In this case, i use it as a thank you.  i was late to the party and still treated with patience and grace.  My food was properly paced and piping in spite of my insistance that they push if need be.  Blaise \"whimed\" a gin, genepy, salt, lime (?), peychaud cocktail that matched the subtlty that was ultimately a thematic vein in my experience.  Tratto, you are good.  Don't forget what you do.  Love how you made me feel.  Empathy is happiness in service.  Thank you for an authentic experience in spite of my timing.  Your success will be a topic of service elsewhere, know that.  Thank you."}
{"text":"They change their menu often but everything we had was outstanding. We started with the lettuce with aged Parmesan. The cheese was delicious. My friend and I split the 2 thin cut pork chops and 2 piccolo chicken. Well, the pork chops came out as 4 and the chicken was a drumstick and thigh, times 2. See the pics. I couldn't decide which was better. My mouth was salivating at both. Pure deliciousness."}
{"text":"What a welcome local addition to the Camelback corridor! Friends were visiting from out of town, and since FnB was closed I thought I'd try Tratto for the first time. It fully lived up to all the good reviews I've been hearing.   Chris Bianco was there, and greeted us warmly at the door. The white-washed interior was very pleasant and comfortable. It was hard to choose from the drinks menu, and all of us were very happy with our selections. I recommend the VDK! Very refreshing summer drink. I may go back just for cocktails at the bar and some nibbles. The olives and pickled veggie plate was a delicious start, as was the always good Bianco bread. The summer melon and fennel salad was a standout -- super fresh and perfectly ripe with maximum flavor. The Pork shoulder was also a hit, as was the eggplant. One friend ordered one of the pastas, and refused to share it because he loved it so much. It looked delicious! Small menu, but there was not one thing on the menu we did not want to try. Service was excellent. Kudos to Chris for creating a comfortable restaurant using great local food to create very tasty dishes. I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Delicious delicious food! This was the second time we've been here and it's been great both times. The menu is small and changes, but everything is done well. We had a party of 6 so we actually just ordered everything on the menu and shared family style. It was great to be able to try everything. The highlight of the evening was the persimmon panna cotta (and I don't always like panna cotta). The space is well done and very relaxing. Would definitely recommend for just about anyone!"}
{"text":"Selection is poor. Food was okay. Service was rude. The host was inconsiderate when my reserved table was given to her friends. Save your money and time. Too expensive for the small portions!!"}
{"text":"My last review was so offensive that the good people at Yelp decided to delete it.  If you want my review in it's entirety, feel free to message me. You won't be disappointed, well...unless you go to this restaurant.  JUST BAD.  Here's some work appropriate highlights of that review:  First of all this place is in Town and Country. Notorious for sucking.  This place is crowded, noisy, pretentious and almost as white and privileged as grassroots next door, a place that also sucks.  The drinks are weak and the portions are tiny. Don't order the Farinata, because it tastes like a piece of burnt air. You can get the same effect wrapping your lips around a hair dryer before you arrive. The other stuff on the menu seems to change quite a bit and is massively overpriced. You shouldn't drop over $100 anywhere on earth and leave hungry. Especially at TOWN AND F-ING COUNTRY.  I ordered a random pasta that was ~$25 and got maybe 6 ounces of total food. Possibly 400 calories. I'm still hungry. WHY AM I STILL HUNGRY? THIS IS DINNER.  I get that you want everyone to come in and give you $75 a head, the problem is: YOU'RE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY CRAMMING PEOPLE INTO SHITTY LITTLE WOODEN TABLES INCHES FROM EACH OTHER.   Get fucking real. You've fooled some of the people, some of the time. Congrats."}
{"text":"Overpriced and over rated  Nothing great, pasta was good Wine list seriously overpriced  Oh wait the bread is great. So back to Pizza Bianco which is great!"}
{"text":"It's weird to eat in a beautiful space in a boring strip mall but they make it work. Our food was adventurous if not always successful. There are a few vegetarian options in the menu, including pasta and veggie centric appetizers. The staff was friendly. For Phoenix this is a step above everything else we ate during our visit."}
{"text":"restaurant was clean and quaint. food was excellent with perfect presentation of foods, waiter staff were polite and attentive. but the food service took forever. we got here at 5:45/6:00 pm and we left at 7:30 after asking for the bill. we had an appetizer, glass of wine (@$14), bread and olive oil. no dessert. we sat outside which was nice but would we come back? maybe because of the atmosphere. not a big selection of wine and limited menu."}
{"text":"The best meal we had in Phoenix!   Hand made, hand rolled pasta with meat sauce, pork shank cooked to perfection to the point it falls off the bone.   This place is so good, a must.  Chris Bianco needs to be celebrated."}
{"text":"Luckily we didn't have to wait in line nor make a reservation, as that would have made the visit even less enjoyable. That said, upon arrival the staff was friendly, fairly knowledgeable, and eager to please as we dined. However, the food was just okay. The portions were fine, but almost every dish on the extremely limited menu seemed to be too rich, which may be fine for desserts, but for main course dining it did not hit the mark. I will say the pork chop was very good, as was the house bread, but the salad, eggplant dish, and pasta courses were all something I'd never order again.  Again, I really wanted to enjoy the trattoria as so many have raved about it, but it fell flat.   Ambiance - Amazing  Quality - very good  Selection - subpar   Taste - mediocre   Value - questionable   If a party of 2 expect to spend a minimum of $140 + if having wine with dinner while sharing courses.  If each guest is having their own course, easily expect to spend $200 + with a single bottle of wine, which can then add an addition $40 - $100 + to the check."}
{"text":"I've been teetering between giving Tratto 4 or 5 stars.   Our meal started with a delicious complimentary plate that consisted of nuts and cheese. For appetizers, we had the radicchio salad. I am not a huge fan of radicchio, however I enjoyed it a lot. For my \"Secondi\", I had the grilled two wash ranch piccolo chicken which the server recommended. It was absolutely delicious and tasty. The juices were flavorful, and I couldn't get enough of it that I finished every bit of it with the complimentary bread. My boyfriend ordered one of the pastas, and I can't remember what it was called to save my life. I do remember it being absolutely phenomenal. It was honestly one of the best pastas I have ever had. I remember the pasta itself being cooked so perfectly, with sweet squash in it.   The service was superb. The servers were attentive. Tratto had a fine dining kind of vibe which was really nice. This is definitely the perfect place to have a date. The restaurant itself was gorgeous. Every piece looked like it was hand picked from a vintage haven. It reminded me of Tratto's sister restaurants (Pizzeria Bianco), but prettier.  So why the four stars then? Tratto is excellent but way overpriced. The chicken was delicious but definitely NOT worth $36. Our bill was $130 for a salad, pasta, chicken and two glasses of wine and we left feeling hungry still.   Needless to say, the food and experience was a solid 5 and I would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? What a sparkling gem! I just popped in on a lark a few weeks ago, and was thoroughly impressed!  We sat at the bar, and honestly, it was as lovely and intimate as if we were seated at a quiet table! Not only that, the food was magnificent!  We shared the grilled chicken livers and a pasta dish and, honestly, it was, hands down, one of the most delicious meals I've ever had.  What makes it even more special, is that we just kind of stopped by -- I have enjoyed Pizzeria and Pane Bianco, and have certainly been aware of Tratto, but I didn't have a reservation, it was merely happenstance that we stopped in.  I truly felt treated to a magical experience.  Thank you to all the staff for such wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I am a native Phoenician of 28 years and a self-proclaimed slightly obnoxious foodie  This is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  The second you walk through the doors the smell of fresh homemade pasta and farm to table high-quality ingredients envelop your senses.  I believe Chris Bianco sources all of his food especially a lot of his produce from Northern California and you can really tell how high-quality it is  This is one of the best date night spots.  Everything there is delicious.  I really hope he opens more restaurants like this in the future"}
{"text":"I've been leaving in Phoenix for quite some time now. I had the chance to also worked in Italy and Trato sent me back there tonight. The food was incredible! The shaved pig head for appetizer was Divin!! Our host,Idle, was very nice and he knew the menu very well. We had the pasta, tortellini stuffed with ricotta and the tagliatelle with chicken liver and it's was out of this world!!! I don't really give reviews but Trato deserve one. I complimented the hostess about their bread and she generously give us a loaf to take home!  I recommend to all of you to check it out! I guarantee you will not regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here last night and couldn't of been more satisfied. The service, the food and the atmosphere was all around perfect. We didn't have reservations but luckily there was two seats open at the bar. We trusted Chef Tony to send out what he thought we'd like and he didn't disappoint. I got the tonnarelli pasta followed by the chicken. Both were amazing and super flavorful! I thought I was full and wouldn't be able to eat anything else until he sent out the dessert.. The tiramisu was delicious but the watermelon with lime juice was so different and refreshing. Needless to say, the whole meal was great. Will definitely be back for Chef Tony's pasta!"}
{"text":"The menu was a bit confusing for me and I accidentally ordered this tiny plate of pasta while my family got large portions. A confusing menu if your usual first visit here."}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  The chef (Chris Bianco) uses only the BEST local ingredients, and it makes a difference.    Portions are large and the house made pastas are fantastic using seasonal vegetables.  The mixologists make a great cocktail and the wine list is lovely.  Service is kind and intelligent.  Desserts are spectacular in an intimate casual Brooklyn type setting......  You think I like it here?    You'd be right.  6 stars.  BEST."}
{"text":"Tried Tratto for the first time with some friends. Beautiful restaurant decorated in what I see as a Martha's Vineyard theme. Very cool. Food portions were small but everything we had was excellent. Cucumber salad was mmmm. The Tratti pasta was amazing. Martinis were good. Tiramisu at the end was a nice touch. The service was very good from an enthusiastic staff.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Truly shocking lack of sensitivity and service.  I'm a regular there and was wrapping up a lovely meal with friends. We had left over 25% tip and we were just enjoying the last of our wine when the host actually asked us to leave so he could have the table.  We were so stunned we just sat with open mouths.  Particularly inexplicable because they had several open tables.  Will be telling everyone to avoid."}
{"text":"We made reservations for dinner over Labor Day weekend and couldn't wait to try it out as we are big Bianco fans!  I enjoyed a Lagrein Rose after we were seated and deciding on our meal for the evening.  The decor is shabby chic, the atmosphere is lively, the service was great and the food was solid (except one minor glitch in our visit).  We shared the little gem salad only to find someone else's hair in it...luckily, the staff addressed it quickly and professionally and we still enjoyed the rest of our meal.  We also shared the tortelli (seriously amazing and totally made up for the hair in the salad), the pork cooked marsala style and an apple crostada to round out the meal.  The menu is somewhat limited, but what they serve is high quality food!"}
{"text":"You guys, this place was nothing short of delicious. We had 6 people in our party and we opted to do family-style dining. We order several appetizers, several pastas and two entrees and passed them around the table. We also had two desserts. The presentation and the flavors did not disappoint! Drink service was a bit slow and we would have consumed more wine if the server had followed up more often, but overall everything was 5-star worthy. :)"}
{"text":"Wow. What a wonderful quaint place with great ambiance and spectacular food.  We went with another couple and enjoyed a fantastic dinner. Our waiter Randy presented the menu quite possibly the best ever. Brought the menu to life and shared more than just the menu.   We enjoyed everything... food temperature, flavor, and presentation was over the top. We shared everything between the four of us family style.  Yes, it was expensive but absolutely worth it. When you can all enjoy and compare it makes the meal conversation even better.  We had the three starters... chicken liver, chick  Pea type naan, and a Gorgonzola salad. All amazing.  We then had pork chops with two amazing sides, mixed squash and roasted potatoes.  We enjoyed the meal with a great Pinot Grigio.    My simple words don't do the meal its justice.  Absolutely fantastic.  I would highly recommend this for couples and friends to have a great dining experience around excellent service and food."}
{"text":"Delightful. I love everything about this place: food, decor, service. Reservation is a must."}
{"text":"At the time of this review Tratto is a newly opened Farm to Table Style Restaurant. The James Beard Awarding Winning Chef and Staff hand pick Produce that is served. A specialty of the house is the hand made pasta that's made from local grains. The menu is limited and changes daily. It's suggested that you share appetizers, a pasta plate, a dinner and more. The atmosphere is energetic, farm fresh casual and a little shabby chic.   On my visit the servers I had were very well trained and knew the menu and were very suggestive about ordering. I warn you that if your server is Maria she will tell you that whatever you order is not enough and you will order maybe two more plates than you need.  They started us off with Crusty Bread, flavorful olive oil and a plate of fresh plucked sweet and flake salted tomatoes, house cured olives, grilled zucchini and house made salami.  We started with the Roasted Beets in Fig Leaves. They had this Gorgonzola Cream on them that was absolutely delicious. The fresh picked  beets do taste different from store purchased beets.  We shared the Farinata. Maria described it as a Chickpea Four Crepe with Tomatoes and Onions. It was really tasty. I felt I had to box it after tasting it or I wouldn't have room for everything else.  We then shared the Scarpinocc that was toothy Raviolis stuffed with milky sweet ricotta cheese in seasoned fava beans and fried sage. The pasta was perfect, The cheese tasted fresh made and the beans were quite a labor of love. Did you ever shell Fava Beans? It's a double shell process that takes all day. Yes it's not cheap but it was worth it for the labor and quality of the pasta and cheese.  For dinner we shared the small Two Wash Ranch Grilled Chicken with Lemon and Bay Leaf. It was simplistic but also perfection. I have to tell you that your $1.50 a pound chicken that you purchase from Safeway or Costco does not taste like a the Two Wash Chicken. This dish was expensive for a whole chicken dinner but I recently purchased a chicken from a local farm and those kind of chickens do cost $25-$30 each so it doesn't seem like it but the price is fair.  Maria also suggested that we needed the potatoes. The potatoes were delicious with the rosemary and garlic. I had to eat some because they were delicious.  The food I tried was amazing. The service was attentive. Maria might have suggested to us more food than we needed but it was all great."}
{"text":"Very weird dining experience. First thing first - with the price tag on most menu items - I expect my waiter/waitress to not be wearing jeans - thats my preference but I think they can do a little better there. They are trying to be an upscale restaurant, lets look like it too.   The food - very interesting - nothing was good enough to write home about. We each had a salad, shared the pancetta spaghetti, and finished with the chicken. Seriously, the spaghetti was the best part. No cocktails, no dessert - price tag over $100. I'm all for quality over quantity but this place seriously is lacking in all avenues of trying to be something they aren't, unfortunately.   The one bright spot: the decor - cute, modern, homey feel. Other than that I will most definitely not be back."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Tratto a weeks ago, most evenings I dine alone, so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I was getting ready to order a glass of wine and subsequent food. I was told that I would have to leave, that the owner had two friends coming in and they were going to put one of the two individuals in my seat at the bar, and there were no other seats available. I certainly understand this chef and restaurant think they're the deal! I live in Arcadia and I have over 1300 friends on social media, in the area. I'll certainly spread the word, that's not how you treat people."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Some of the best Italian food I've had in Phoenix. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is ( in my humble opinion) THE BEST OF PHOENIX!!!  I mean, if you are going to splurge and eat food, this is without a doubt, the place!  Appetizers, salads, entrees, desserts.... all delicious!!!  Actually the chef and owner, Chris Bianco, is the gem of Arizona. He is all about quality, innovation, community, and kindness!!!! For an intimate meal with your partner or a celebration with friends, Tratto, Tratto, Tratto!!!"}
{"text":"Tratto is amazing! The service is impeccable.  The cocktails are creative delights.  And the food..... words are inadequate to express how fantastic a meal at Tratto is! Not only is it terrific but the portions will satisfy even the most ravenous appetite! If you're looking for a dining experience you'll long remember, make your reservations today!"}
{"text":"A farm to table restaurant in Phoenix with a frequently changing menu that serves flavorful dishes that is served family style - and it's very good!  This is my first visit to Tratto, and none of the misgivings I had from reading critical Yelp reviews were confirmed. I called on Saturday noon to make a reservation for 5 PM that evening. Kendall called me back at 3:30 PM to let me know that they had availability - so far so good. We ordered cocktails. Yes the cocktails come in small glasses, but my margarita was really strong - nothing watered down about it. The waiter was helpful in explaining the menu. Before his explanation, we were going to order 2 protein plates from the Secondi section, but he explained that that was going to be a lot of meat.  We ended up with 3 Antipasti plates (salad with Pecorino cheese, sautéed chicken livers, Farinata). The previous reviewers raved about the chicken liver pates, and so I was a little worried when the sautéed livers showed up. The garlicky livers were accompanied by jam that gave this dish that salty-sweet dichotomy and made the livers buttery. There was no grittiness or the metallic taste of livers that I was afraid of. So definitely give the livers a chance if it's on the menu. We polished off the Antipasti dishes and we were already feeling a little full. The Primi pasta was the Garganelli with duck confit. Mmm! Now we're really getting full, and getting worried that we ordered too much food. We chose the pork chops as our Secondi, and ordered roasted potatoes to accompany it. Very lightly seasoned and the chops were bone-in and sliced so that each person could get 2 slices. At this point, we all ate one slice, a potato each, and then had to ask for a box to take these chops and potatoes home. We powered through dessert by sharing a panne cotta with blood oranges and mint. The Americano coffee was really strong too! My dining companions were all older ladies, and so the amount of food presented was more than enough. The flavor of all the dishes were subtle and pleasing to me. But if you're dining with men with hearty appetites who like their food to be on the large side, the portions may not be enough and you may have to order an additional plate. Also if you're expecting a heavily garlic centered tomato paste extravaganza type of Italian food, then this is not the restaurant for you."}
{"text":"Could not be happier with our experience at Tratto. The restaurant's atmosphere and staff are welcoming and relaxed. We started with two excellent cocktails, the VDK and an olive oil gin martini. The food was amazing and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Such a cute little restaurant tucked away in a busy plaza. Great ambiance! Excellent menu and appreciated the organic and local food sources. Knowledgeable waitstaff. Great service. Giving it 4 stars only because of the dessert selections. Couldn't find one single appealing dessert. Other than that, perfect date night and we had great food!"}
{"text":"Love Pizzeria Bianco, the uniqueness of it all, the quality, the experience of tasting something I would have never thought of at home. I had hoped this would match that, but be kicked up a notch as a finer dining restaurant. I was sadly wrong.  Here is the play by play: - No menu posted on site. But what could go wrong I thought.  - Interior - Nice, nothing new - clean, white, similar to numerous places around town - including Pizzeria Bianco next door. Let's hope food is more unique.  - \"Complimentary of the kitchen\" plate of honey melon, sausage and olives. Nice touch. - We order, and have to ask what most things are as they are names I can't read as the font is impossible to decipher (I'm a designer, and I usually LOVE cool fonts. This isn't.) Oh wait, did I mention I'm a vegetarian? With only 4 starters, two pastas, two entrees and one side (potatoes - urgh.) And most of them with meat as the star, I'm extremely limited. And not thrilled. - Appetizer: as explained \"Vegetables with a (interesting sounding) oil\" I figure it's some sauteed yummy stuff. Wrong. It's a crudite platter (You should have called it that! I would NOT have ordered) with some oil to dip in. Did I say platter? 4 tiny carrots, One small celery stick (server dropped the second on the way in) 2 radishes, two fennel halves and three shavings of watermelon radish. I believe this was $14. Really? These were not magical carrots. Per ounce, they should have been. - Complimentary bread: four small pieces (aka two slices cut in half). dry. yawn. - Course 2: Basically pasta Bolognese. Really? Now my imagination is going to sleep. Where are magic carrots when you need them? Very tasty - very small. Pasta was lovely. Glad we got it. Now there is something to make that bread interesting! - Course 3: Chicken. Hmmm...yep. Chicken. That's about as exciting as it was. Good, well cooked chicken. No sides, light lemon and olive oil. Again - where is the Wow!? - Oh, not mentioning the server as he pretty much was MIA as soon as a table near us was sat with a local chef around the time the bread arrived.  The price for our 3 (three) dishes + two iced teas and tip? Just shy of $100. Let's recap. a veggie dip mini plate, pasta and a chicken breast. Yes, I was on something. A bad trip. One I won't make again.  **Edit** totally pushed out of my mind (for good reason) that we had a grey hair in our crudite oil. When pointed out (after I fished it out of my mouth as it tagged a ride along with a carrot) the hostess just said - we don't have anyone with grey hair in our kitchen (neither me or my friend has it either) and just took the oil container off the plate and brought a new one. She was completely indifferent. We didn't even touch the remaining items.   In summary, if you are a food purest, and you don't often treat yourself to farm fresh food or chicken, this may knock your socks off.  If you are looking for something you can't do yourself at home - go next door to Pizzeria Bianco."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal here.  It is more a quaint chic Italian restaurant than a real Italian experience like at Andreoli.  Still everything we had here was delicious.  My favorite dish was the chicken liver which was divine.  The atmosphere is elegantly casual.  There is definitely talent in the kitchen.  I wouldn't call it inexpensive or even medium priced.  There were 5 of us (only 3 drinkers) and the bill was $275 without tip.  We would definitely come back here and appreciate having another Italian option in the Phoenix area that go beyond Andreoli, Pomo and Trattoria Veneto."}
{"text":"Da bomb.  Went here for a birthday and ordered literally one of everything.  Delicious top to bottom.  Their Shirley temple was even amazing.  Will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian in Phoenix. They have a small menu with the highest quality products. Everything we ate was delicious.  Sautéed Chicken Livers on Crostini. Wow. Pasta with guinea Hen ragu.  Char-grilled thin Pork Chops with warm fresh Peaches.  The service was perfect. Noise level was moderate. Can't wait to go agai   We went back to Tratto again tonight because the food was so enjoyable last week. This time not so much. Mr Bianco was actually cooking tonight. Much to my dismay everything we ordered was way over salted. I'm talking about the pasta the roasted chicken and even the salad!! The man has a real heavy hand with the kosher salt. What a difference a week makes."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this restaurant, loved Pizza Bianco the times I'd gone.  I have tried many really wonderful restaurants in the valley on my visits into Phoenix to see my family over the past thirty years.  Nearly every trip we pick a new restaurant to try, and this trip it was Tratto.  There were four of us and we ate family style.    The pate appetizer was outstanding, and the only really wonderful thing we had all night.  First I should say nothing looked like the pictures you see on Yelp.  The two pasta dishes were small portions, and really only passably good.  I appreciate the artisan approach to making the pasta in house, but they were both OK, but not delicious, and honestly fairly pedestrian dishes.    The roasted chicken was over brined, and remarkably small, just tiny, it was as small or smaller than a Cornish hen.  The pork we didn't even eat, it was again over brined (salty), but the real issue was it's rubbery texture.  Really horrible. The corn side dish was somewhat embarrassing, five quarter cobs, probably frozen, with some herb and parmesan cheese on top.  It needed salt (which we asked for early on and they never brought), and was dry and tasteless.  If corn is not in season, why are you searving it?  Service, like the food and the value, was questionable.  When the proteins came out all staff seemed to disappear, no one checked on the table, no one even walked by.  We had to find a waiter to ask for the check, and when he asked if we wanted to box up the pork, and I explain why we hadn't eaten it, he said (like he had heard it many times) 'ooh, OK', and brought the check.   After they had ran the card and we were leaving the manager came over to ask if there was a problem, I gave him what I hope was a kind but honest rundown of the good and bad points, he offered to run a credit on the bill, but it was just too late, and we left.  Regrettable food, regrettable service, unjustifiable prices, a never go to again kind of place."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant in the Town & Country shopping center.  It's a small, cute space with nice decor and ambiance.  I sat at the bar for dinner and had a great time.  I knew that I wanted some pasta and the cavatelli with lamb was amazing.  The pasta was the perfect shape and size to hold the meat sauce. The flavors all worked together and I was completely happy with my meal.  The service at the bar was friendly and after talking to the bartender about the different amaros that they carry I'll make sure to have one on my next visit."}
{"text":"Tratto is overrated. I went based on Yelp review and the customer service was beyond terrible as was the food. Huge let down."}
{"text":"Wanted to bring my parents somewhere tasty during their recent visiting. Can't argue that Tratto food is high-quality, but definitely expensive. Bill came to $360 for 4 people, though we did try most of the menu. Worth it? I thought so at the time, but am second guessing when I look at my bank statement. :-/  Greens, smoked trout, tagliarini pasta, and whole snapper were winners. Our cocktails this time were all meh, so maybe stick to wine? Save this place for a special occasion, when dinner IS the event and you don't need to rush off after."}
{"text":"Fresh food. Excellent atmosphere. Upscale ingredients, presented simply. Perfect for a romantic dinner. Not many things on the menu, which is a good thing.  Stick to staff recommendation and be adventurous. Chef Bianco has done it again."}
{"text":"Yelp requires a reviewer to select a star or else I would have rated 0 stars.   Cannot review the restaurant because I phoned 3 times, left 3 vmails over a 3 day period for a reservation and never received a callback. Horrible customer service. Good luck with that reservation policy."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, knowledgeable and courteous staff...and did i mention the FOOD?  This place is fantastic! I've seen criticisms on here that the food is too simple for the price.  That is the very thing that makes this place sooooo good.  Simple, fresh, high-quality ingredients make for an amazing, well executed meal.  Tratto is def one of the best restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Breads here... my Fav. The food here melts in your mouth. Portions are perfect. Highly recommended to do family style so you can try everything on the menu!  I got lucky able to take a picture with the owner too, Chris Bianco! PS the place isn't big so groups of 4 is perfect."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. We went for Valentine's Day and the prom chop might have been the best thing I have ever had. The potato cake awakens the pasta amazing. I will defiantly be going back."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this unless you want to get on a plane to NY or Italy. Every course from starters to pasta to entree was to die for.  The small but eclectic Menu changes frequently which will only make you want to return often to sample as many dishes as you can. For starters, the chicken liver pate is sublime.  The roasted summer squash (served cold and a great summer dish) equally so though not as decadent. Pasta is cooked to perfection.  We elected to share one in between our stater and entrees and so glad we did as you do not want to leave here without sampling a pasta dish. Pork and chicken entrees were the best we have ever had. Love the Farm to Table vibe...the white washed walls and wood floors with white linens add a touch of elegance!   This will soon be the toughest reservation to get in Phoenix!  But well worth planning ahead to dine here."}
{"text":"Transportative. Enlivening. Intoxicating flavors. Bold as love. Real food. Food the way food is supposed to be-or once was before factory farms and distractions. We happened to get the last seat at Tratto on the patio last night. And that made us lucky. And the thing about Chris Bianco's food is that it doesn't transport you to somewhere else as one imagines some food can. It doesn't take you to Italy, Tratto. No, it takes you to Phoenix. It takes you to Chris Bianco's utopian vision of food and place. And one is, as Chris would want one to be, deeply aware of both the farmer's hands and the server's care. The food is just a doorway to all the folks who made it happen. We were lucky enough to have chicken livers and lamb ragu and trout and that salad. And every single thing we ate astounded us with the richness, boldness, and balance of flavors. The tagliatelle was wildly acidic and creamy at once. The salty livers paired with sweet sticky berry jam. It was all distinctly memorable in a way that most things in our modern world aren't. I'm so happy. Thank you."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was not a fan. The restaurant was cute and the service wasn't bad, but the food just didn't cut it for me. We decided to share the greens salad and farinata for appetizers. The greens salad was literally big chunks of lettuce, vinaigrette, and lots and lots of cheese. It didn't taste good. The farinata was not any better - it was a bland potato cake. As the main course, I ordered the Tonnarelli. The portions were small, but luckily, it had good flavor and I practically ate the whole thing. For the high prices, I didn't think the meal was worth it."}
{"text":"AMAZING! We went on a Friday night without a reservation, and we were very luckily that they had two open seats at the bar when we arrived. The place is small and intimate. It was busy the entire night. I wouldn't test fate again by going without a reservation. We had a couple of great glasses of red wine to start. All the food was amazing but the stand out was the two pasta dishes. We originally couldn't decide between tonnarelli and cancelli, and compromised by getting both. I was so glad we did! The tonnarelli was my favorite, it had huge chunks of delicious roasted elephant garlic. The cancelli is made with pork shank and the pork flavor really comes through. The cancelli was my date's favorite item of the night. The texture of both pastas was perfect. The pasta convinced me that Tratto is even better than its sister restaurant, Pizzeria Bianco! Towards the end of the meal at Tratto, we saw Chris Bianco himself, I was starstruck to see the James Beard Award winner!"}
{"text":"All of us have a place and a feeling that we want (sometimes need!) to experience at the end of a brutal day. A place to slow down, enjoy the atmosphere and food, and literally take deep breaths,. Comfort food plays a huge part. For me, that typically means italian. As most of you know, Tratto (next to Pizzeria Bianco) opened just a few weeks ago, and even on their opening night we experienced the place and that feeling. Chris BIanco is a master in setting the stage and having the right players in place. The experience at Tratto was amazing!   Pork loin was incredibly tender and satisfying, and the pasta...well...extraordinary says everything. A few nights ago, we were craving a re-doo...and it was booked...which I was actually thrilled to see. We went next door for a meal..I know...such a sacrifice..NOT....and then returned to Tratto to enjoy more ambiance.  When we find a chef that speaks to our hearts....we will be loyal and follow them anywhere.  Chef Chris is extraordinary and my hope is that you will give him a piece of your heart like he does every night to his guests. Mille Grazie!"}
{"text":"Everything about TRATTO speaks true Italian culture. There is not a better meal & culinary experience in the state."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best dining experience I've ever encountered! I went here with my boyfriend for his birthday and there wasn't a single thing we did not enjoy. (And trust me, we ate a lotttttttt). The cocktails were incredible (especially the turmeric mule) and each course was better than the previous. You need to plan ahead with reservations and the space is PERFECT for a special occasion or romantic date night. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely odd. I came in and the host was on the phone so I just bypassed him and sat at an empty seat at the bar. Immediately after the bartender asks me if I'm eating dinner because people at bianco next door were supposed to take my seat. Instead he tells me I have to sit in the portion of the bar that's partially outdoors and he'd open the \"garage door\" for me. Host doesn't approach me or apologize. I'm not asking for free things just basic good service and acknowledgement for mistakes.   Finally sit and have some food. I know they're trying to be the fancier sibling next door but the service and food was just clunky. I got offered an amuse Bouche? Or at least I think. It was a slice of cheese. One grape tomato. And one Olive. Yup haha.   The saving grace was the copa de testa app which was delicious. I also had the double cut porkchop which was ok. Great seasoning but I'd rather have a smaller cut with sides/ a more composed dish. My plate was literally a huge chunk of pork and a few peppers on top.   Overall good effort but service and food need refinement especially at these prices."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing place to eat. Small menu that's very well thought of. My friend and I dined there and We ordered merlot and Pino noir and it was great. Bread and olive oil is a must at an Italian restaurant. We ordered the cucumber salad which was heavenly, we got the tortellini and that was just to die for. We then got the half chicken each and that was GOOD.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the items on on this menu. Everything was delicious, seating host and wait staff were on top of things. Getting clean plates for the next meal (since we shared antipasti and pasta) was almost seconds before the next meal was up. I'd definitely recommend this place for a small group gathering, foodie friends get together, and a special date!"}
{"text":"Very good spot. Worth the money, good food, drinks that pair nicely and excellent ambiance."}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal I've had in Phoenix. We tried one of everything from the menu and I was blown away by the amount of flavor in each dish. The highlight for me was the heirloom tomato pasta which I expected to like the least. Service is on point, the drinks are amazing (Valley Beer, Manhattan, Espresso Martini). We'll be back again and again"}
{"text":"Arizona is so strange in that great restaurants can be found in strip malls. We loved every single thing we ordered at Tratto, starting with their light and bright summer squash and a lovely salad with shallot vinegarette and aged cheese. I ordered the homemade pasta with artichoke hearts and my husband had a homemade pasta with beef ragu. To end, we shared the lemon tart (our favorite) and a piece of classic tiramisu. Other strong points: their house made cherry soda and whatever olive oil they are using is fantastic. My only gripe is that the seats aren't super comfortable."}
{"text":"Just feed me everything this place has to offer. Finding the place is kind of an adventure in its own so trust your instincts outside of GPS and keep a lookout. We had the chicken liver and strawberry preserves with the pasta entree with lamb. Mind blown goodness!!! The cocktails are pretty damn tasty classics so everything from the importance to me was on freaking point.  Eddie was our bartender who carefully explained everything to ensure we understood everything along with providing niiiiinnnja service that was just right to make sure our evening was going great.  Totally will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Several years ago, Chris Bianco opened up a little trattoria in Town and Country known as Italian Restaurant. The concept was made clear, but largely due to his reputation as a renowned pizza chef, it never really found its feet. The eatery eventually morphed into a hybrid Italian Restaurant/Pizzeria Bianco location, until ultimately becoming a second Pizzeria Bianco with an expanded menu.      In many ways, I feel that this is what Italian Restaurant would have been if things had panned out as originally planned. With this in mind, don't go in here expecting to find any pizza on the menu. In fact, the only similarities this place shares with its neighboring restaurant are the bread, drink options, and some familiar faces on staff. Bianco appears to have practically moved the entire Pizzeria crew over here from next door.  Although the restaurant may be described as one that stands on its own, I still find that its vibe is consistent with the other locations. There's a rustic/industrial feel that I've always found is a great contrast to the current obsession of restaurants looking like the owner robbed an IKEA.  If you plan on going here, I suggest making a reservation. Even on the weekdays. My girlfriend and I are so used to just strolling into Pizzeria Bianco and being seated immediately on Thursday nights, that we were surprised to find that they were booked solid during our attempted second visit. We had to plan accordingly for the following week. Another visit required us to book two weeks in advance for a Thursday.  If you've sampled some of the market pastas at the neighboring restaurant, you'll quickly learn that Bianco does far, far more than just bake pizza. The pastas we've tried here, as well as the pork shank were all very good. The only thing that I have an issue with is that the menu is constantly changing and selections are very limited. So, if there's nothing you like from their limited options, you can't revert back to permanent staples aside from a few exceptions. Nothing seems to stay on the menu for very long.  Prices are a little higher than what you might be used to and the serving sizes, at least with the pastas, are much smaller than I would have assumed. A 20-plus dollar pasta here provides roughly half of what you get for a market pasta at the Pizzeria location. The quality is the same and the serving size is far more generous next door. The vibe of Tratto is slightly more upscale, but not to the point where I'd call it a \"fancy\" restaurant. Servers all seem like they're just phoning it in and running on auto-pilot. No one really inquires about what we think about the food, because they all just kind of assume that everything they serve is perfect. Although it mostly is, which is probably why Tratto has the distinction of being the only restaurant AZ food critic Dominic Armato has given a perfect five-stars to.  After dining here several times, I feel it's more of an occasional visit than a place I'd eat at regularly. Between making reservations so far in advance and not having any idea what will be on the menu makes it somewhat of a gamble. And every time we get the bill, I'm immediately reminded of why I can't bring myself to give them a full five stars. I'm all about upscale dining, but the food here is largely equivalent in quality to what you receive next-door, only it's significantly more expensive. A two-person pasta/pizza dinner with dessert at Bianco can run about 60 dollars, while this can easily exceed 100 without anything leftover. I mean, their desserts are good - but twelve dollars for some dark chocolate chunks and a couple of cookies? This is where the line between being a chef and being a \"brand\" start blurring.  Nevertheless, the food is great quality and will most likely please those who enjoy a great Italian meal.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"I took my fiancé here for his birthday dinner. Our drinks (white negroni and martini) were flawlessly made. Food was incredible, and pasta was very al dente. Pricey compared to Italian food I've had in New York, but a romantic and luxurious spot for dinner in Phoenix. Sit outside at the bar for the best view of the dining room and the kitchen."}
{"text":"Tratto had me at Hello!  Every aspect of this quaint, nostalgic, foodie driven restaurant has more attention to detail than I've seen in years.  The staff all love their work & are inspired by the culinary creations with food and drink.  Their eyes light up in describing their menu choices, like the aged sour cherry on top of the Pate to balance acidity & sweetness.  The bartender Blaze uses aged infusions, lights up lemons in carafes, created his own vermouth; clearly an alchemist from another era!  The ambience & finishes are gorgeous.  It's the home/dining  you always want to return to.  Thank you, Chris for creating this one!  A Foodies Fave!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Fantastic cocktails (the martini was delicious) and even better food. We split a pasta and a main, plus a side.  Perfect amount of food for two. Make a reservation!!!!"}
{"text":"Chris has again shown his depth of skill, attention to detail and perfect execution by he and his staff.   We had the pork chops with peaches and the dinner squash with a salad that had a roasted shallot vinaigrette. There is simply nothing like Tratto anywhere else in the valley.   The design of the restaurant is a comfortable Italian style eatery where they make you feel like you are in a small town in Italy.   The old fashioned was unbelievable. Too hard to explain how good that was.   The staff in knowledgeable, courteous, and attentive. This was a special occasion and Chris and his staff absolutely delivered.   Go there as soon as you can. It's that good."}
{"text":"I cannot concur with most of these 4 to 5 stars reviews.  Yes, the decor is beautiful; with the open kitchen concept and softly lit gothic candles and the entire restaurant basically all dressed in white.  But aside from that, there was not much else to be impressed about.    The roasted chicken was juicy and relatively delicious, but it was not worth $38 a plate.  (I do think that many reviews give Tratto such high remarks because they had to have a reason to justify the price they just paid for a mediocre dinner.)  The crepe appetizer was mediocre; the bottom was actually soggy.  My mom can make the stir-fried oyster mushrooms and young choy sum a ton better.  The cavatelli was also mediocre; nothing you cannot create at home in your own kitchen.    Service was lackluster and everything at this place is disappointingly uninspiring.  Maybe my taste for good Italian food is too acute or living in Vegas has spoiled me for the out-of-Vegas fine dining scene, but I didn't really care about Tratto other than the company I was with."}
{"text":"I hate to give a bad review to such a great chef's restaurant, but feel it's necessary after our experience at this restaurant last night! I really am not one to complain, but I left very disappointed with my overall experience at Tratto.   We were out for a celebration last night and have been wanting to get to Tratto since in opened last month, as Chris Bianco is a well renowned chef in the valley for his \"Pizzeria Bianco,\" which we love!  The restaurant is very chic with Italian rustic charm and elegance. Felt like we were in another city, and I loved that aspect of the restaurant.    We failed to make a reservation (on a Saturday evening...not a good idea, but we assumed we could not make one with only 2 people in a restaurant with ~30 seats.)  So we didn't mind waiting for the proposed hour that the hostess quoted us for a table or seats at the bar.  After working in the industry for a number of years we're well aware that as a hostess you always over quote your table waiting time to avoid the exact problem we ran into.  To be honest, I think she forgot about us because other people behind us got seated before us who also did not have a reservation.  However, we did not bring that up nor were we upset (outwardly) about having to wait over 2 hours to sit at the bar.    The hostess asked us if we wanted to order some drinks or cocktails, we agreed and gave her our order. We did not receive them for a long period of time (15-20 minutes) while sitting outside of the restaurant.    We finally got seated in the corner of the bar, and again waited an extended period of time before the bartender acknowledged we were there and asked if we wanted anything to drink.   Food: Antipasti-  *Chicken liver pate: don't order this unless you are a huge fan of pate, it is a lot to handle. A little too overwhelming with the amount of pate for the crostini and the rich flavors. Definitely something to share with other pate-lovers!   *Spring greens salad: light, lovely, simple. Lots of fresh, salty parmesan made it happen. A little bit of a flavorless shallot vinaigrette. It was good... nothing to write home about.   Primi- *Ricotta filled homemade pasta with dried peaches: amazing! This is what I was hoping for, fresh made, authentic Italian pasta. Not overwhelming with a thick sauce, just simple and full of flavor. This was the best thing that happened to us all night.   Secondi- *pork chop: sauce was light and refreshing with the tomatoes and fava beans, but the pork chop was way over done, and very dry.  Presentation was beautiful but the consistency failed to follow.   After a 4 hour long experience we opted out of dessert, I was just excited to get home.    My biggest complaint about this restaurant is that Chris Bianco was in the restaurant, we watched him stop by every table and ask how the service was, chat with his patrons.  However, he never came to us, the hostess never apologized, the bartender barely spoke to us. And after agreeing to wait all of that time, there was never a, \"Thank you for your patients,\" or any attempt to even speak to us whatsoever. No explanation of the menu or, \"a welcome into our restaurant for the first time, let us guide you through the menu.\" We've worked in the restaurant business and hospitality and we understand that even the smallest gesture of kindness goes a very long way in helping change an experience completely. I figured after we waited for so long they would be super excited that we stuck around to spend our money with them but instead we were ignored, almost blatantly.   You can put the best chef in town in the kitchen, but if the staff doesn't follow it's a big disaster. I understand it's new and there is always room for improvement but If I'm going to spend the money to eat out I want to be floored by the experience and enjoy something I'm not able to make or replicate at home...It's likely we won't return as there are so many talented chefs and amazing restaurants to be tried in the valley.     :("}
{"text":"No wait since we were there when it first opened. Felt out of place since the snotty host asked if we had reservations which we didn't. Said they could seat us as long as we were done in 1 1/2 hours...said no problem unless it took them that long to make our meals. I had a pork chop that was overcooked...and for the price should have been the best pork chop I ever had.  Took most of it home and fed it to the dog."}
{"text":"When you're afraid of giving five stars, because then more people will show up, which means less opportunity for you to dine here whenever you want.  My favorite in town. If you truly love great food in its simplest form, this is it.  Bring a few people and order everything on the menu. Order all the pastas, and then order them again before you cash out.  Because you will have wished you did on the drive home."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Let me start with this - this place is not perfect.  It is not other-worldly Italian food.  But as a general disciple of the Chef Bianco school of thought, I get what he's trying to accomplish and he does a pretty good job accomplishing it.  Came here with my wife and family the Friday after opening Wednesday.  We love the interior.  Chef was going for a trattoria vibe, and he pulled it off with personal and country accents.  Chef Bianco was there himself that week and we were warmly greeted by him and his staff.  He came to check on us again near the end of our meal and ushered us out as we left.  One of the classiest chefs I've had the pleasure of meeting.  We ordered a couple cocktails:  the Fort Cobb and the VDK.  (All ingredients can be seen on on the menu I posted in the photos.)  The Fort Cobb was very citrusy, a great summer drink.  It was tasty, though I may not order it again.  Too citrusy?  A little too sweet?  Still trying to pin ti down.  The VDK is excellent.  Well balanced, light, also perfect for summer.  The herbs were noticeable and a necessary counterbalance to the other ingredients.  We ordered almost everything on the menu.  The farinata, made from ground beans, was crispy around the edges and very tasty.  Subtle, it was good opener.  We also loved the complimentary antipasti that came out before the meal:  olives, cherry tomatoes, marinated squash, and salumi (a house cured sausage.)  All good, a nice opener.  There are also two types of bread in the bread service, the same Italian loaf he serves at his pizzerias, and what appears to be a whole wheat grain loaf.  Stick with the Italian loaf to have with the olive oil.  Tonnarelli alla Gricia and strozzapretti with a fava bean and cherry tomato ragu.  These were our pastas.  Let me just say this.  Chef Bianco has a set of balls on him.  He's serves a very firm al dente pasta.  Like, Mario Batali al dente.  Al dente to the point where the center of the pasta is just barely cooked.  This is a delicious al dente, but not an al dente for everyone.  What you will get is an amazing chew  on your pasta.  It's that chew that adds the textural difference to the dish since the rest is basically just sauce and cheese.  One might complain about the pasta, particularly the alla Gricia, being over-seasoned.  That, too, is a matter open to debate and taste.  We've been to Rome and the alla Gricia, in all its guanciale and slices of cheesy goodness, compared well to some of the salty goodness of the cacio e pepe we had there.  The Tonnarelli all Gricia was a fine pasta dish, the strozzapretti with ragu - this dish was a revelation.  This is the dish with the chew - that aggressive al dente.  The ragu - phenomenal.  This was the single best dish of the night.  Many braised pork shanks before, first one served alla Milanese for me.  The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, with the Milanese crust adding some necessary texture.  Only small complaint, could have used a little more liquid in the dish.  Contorni was wood roasted eggplant.  Second-favorite dish of the night.  Perfectly cooked, very-well balanced.  Almost meaty-like, with a good dose of cheese and acidity to even it out.  Dessert was a simple chocolate gelato.  It is made in-house.  Its consistency is NOT that of the best gelato I've ever had.  Its flavor IS one of the best I've ever had, and I don't like chocolate.  Pretend you froze some dark chocolate fudge, emphasis on dark.  Now spoon into it.  That's what it was like.  Dark, deep, and delicious.    The one major misstep of the night.  We didn't finish the pork and asked for it to-go.  They never brought it back to us.  (Partially our fault too, for not remembering to ask for it before we left.)  I say it again, this is not a perfect Italian restaurant.  There are far superior Michelin-starred and non-Michelin starred joints out there.  I may not enjoy the next new dish I have there, though I hope to.  You may not enjoy the level of seasoning or their version of al dente.  But this restaurant has a vision, and it has executed that vision, and on this trip - it was executed very well."}
{"text":"Simply the best.  In house made pasta, beautiful meats, elegant experience."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a billion stars I would JUST for their food alone. I don't think I've ever had food so delicious in my life seriously!!!!! Forget about the ambiance and service come here FOR THE FOOD ALONE. This place was SO DELICIOUS that if they served it to my in HELL I wouldn't care it was SO GOOD. So super tasty yet light! Of course the ambiance and service was amazing but OMG THE FOOD!!!!!! Just come here to eat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And believe me you'll want to take home leftovers."}
{"text":"Cacio e Pepe was my favorite. Simple and delicious. Farinata =delicious! Service is outstanding. I didn't expect a good cocktail here. They had a Valentine's Day special cocktail and it was very good as well. I would come back and try more pasta. Looks like their menu changes weekly."}
{"text":"Date night. We had a 7:15 reservation and arrived 5 minutes early.  The host said it would be a few minutes before our table was ready, so we opted to sit at the bar.  5 -10 minutes passed and the host never made eye contact or checked back with us.  Decided we were comfy enough to enjoy our meal and the recap is as follows:  First off this place is farm to table...I give props to the bartender for knowing the city and farm of each menu item.  Some may not care, for the folks who love to eat local, farm to table, the staff knows their stuff!  Chicken Liver Pate appetizer - Delicious spread on top of crusty, grilled grain bread.  I realize we are in an Italian restaurant, yet am currently eating a gluten-free lifestyle so scraping the pate off the top was less delightful, yet the marinated dark cherry was a pleasant treat!!!  Chef easily could present the pâté in a small jar or on the plate to rectify future gluten free guests.  Chicken entree, grilled cauliflower, greens with white beans.  First off the chicken was cooked perfectly and the serving dish had enough light lemon 'gravy' to dip and enjoy each delectable bite.  The cauliflower/romanesco grilled was easily something anyone can do at home...nice flavor, easy side.  Greens with white beans were complex, full of flavor, and best eaten with a squeeze of lemon given the bitterness of the collards (?).    Wine list, meh.  Shared a 2014 Buehler Cab, nice easy drinking. No complaints, not over the top delicious though and markup standard and reasonable.  Overall I give Tratto three stars, because the host NEVER came back and asked if we wanted to move to a table. Service is part of the experience!"}
{"text":"Chef Bianco is a national treasure that fortunately for us made his home here in Phoenix. The food at tratto is refined but not fussy. The chicken dish is one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had with a nice crispy skin and incredibly tender. Pasta is excellent, and the okra dish perfectly accompanied the chicken. Can't wait to eat here again"}
{"text":"Items ordered: Hard Cheese, Fennel Salami and Olives Italian Loaf, Focaccia, Whole Wheat Bread with Olive Oil Farinata with Olives, Lemon and Rosemary Kobocha Squash Casoncelli with Brown Butter, Sage and Aceto Balsamico Meyer Lemon Pappardelle with Lamb Sausage and Rapini Whole Roasted Cauliflower with Olive Oil, Lemon, Parmigianino-Reggiano Marsala Braised Pork Shank Alla Milanese Tiramisu Apple Crostata with Crema  Opened by Chris Bianco in May, the space next to his Town & Country Pizzeria hoping to learn from mistakes of the short-lived Italian Restauant of years past, Tratto sees the Chef and his team embrace the same sort of modest elegance that has defined Bianco as one of the most prominent American culinary voices for decades, the all-white décor just the first indicator of the beauty of simplicity in an era defined by excess.   Larger than it appears from the outside, though still seating no more than forty-five persons when accounting for the bar, those fortunate enough to make a reservation at the dinner-only spot are greeted on entry by pleasant smiles from a modest podium, seats serenaded by light music and tight, but not *too* close to one another as servers purposefully navigate the floor.  Featuring garage-door style access to the exterior plus a patio, the al fresco season longer in Arizona than elsewhere, it was with a menu of just ten choices that diners were presented, one nightly special plus two desserts more well-culled than limited, tables of four or more wisely encouraged to order and share one of each plate.  With Chris himself not present this evening, but the kitchen assuredly still in good hands, it was with small nibbles of Cheese, Olives and Salami that decisions were debated, three styles of house baked Bread arriving minutes later with a layered dish of Olive Oil.  Doing best to sample the seasonal menu's highlights, the Produce undoubtedly top tier but Salads too filling for two adults and a child, Tratto's Chickpea Farinata proved to be the meal's low point with a base that was crisp but too oily beneath briny Olives, the follow-up of two handmade Pastas showing the same quality recalled from Bianco's previous location next-door as the light Citrus ribbons stood up boldly to Lamb Ragu while envelopes of tender Squash were picture and palate perfect in a shallow pool of Brown Butter, Sage and aged Balsamic.  Electing for the nightly special contorti of steamed-whole Cauliflower alongside a meaty Pork Shank in Marsala Gravy, the comforting flavors of the latter nicely paired to something light, snappy and fresh, desserts are offered by description only with two flavors familiar from years before offered - Mama Bianco's Tiramisu a dense sponge rich with Espresso and liquor while the hand-formed Crostata continued the rustic theme with rough edges and a dollop of freshly whipped cream."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best restaurants in the valley.  Our server was very knowledgeable in explaining the menu and recommending portions. My wife and I ordered an item off of each portion of the menu allowing us to try many different dishes.  Each one did not disappoint. Bianco has a great thing going here, be sure and give It a shot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary with dinner at Tratto.  Small vintage location with outstanding Italian food and great service!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute treat. Came here with 2 girlfriends and enjoyed everything very much. The place is a clean white decor to make it feel classy yet homey. I thought it was lovely.   They start by bringing out a plate of pickles and olives one for each person.  Then fresh bread - love me some good bread ;) We started off with the Shishito peppers with elephant garlic aioli.  I was taking my bread and dipping it in this sauce it was so tasty.  Went great with the peppers as well :)   For Main course we each got a pasta and split everything.  We had Rusilli Pugliesi with spicy sausage, zucchini and parsley - ricotta gnocchi with heirloom tomato sauce and the pasta special which were stamped pasta medallions in a mixed mushroom sauce.  Each were delicious in their own way with the blend of flavors.  Pastas were all cooked to the perfect al dente.  My favorites were the first two - they just had the most flavor and were a bit more complex.  I did love the variety of mushrooms in the third just didn't stand out like the others.  The only downfall were the portions and cost.  Each dish ranged around $20 - three entrees and an appetizer (no drinks) cost us around $80.  Not terrible but just be prepared you may still be hungry.  Overall, I will be back because I was happy with everything.  Service was great and Chris Bianco was in the restaurant and said hello and thank you - always a nice touch."}
{"text":"Tratto. Chris Bianco. Brilliant in ways I'm not sure I can convey. Vivid, homemade, soul satisfying fare. How often is every single gesture, taste, sight, sound, bouquet and bite right? If you land in Phoenix; Go there!!!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for authentic Italian this is a fantastic spot. I love the intimate atmosphere. Whether at one of their limited tables or at the bar it has such a lovely energy. The food is wonderful. Limited menu of course but it's seasonal. Quality over quantity here."}
{"text":"I took my Mom here last night, and we proceeded to order way too much food. ;-)  We ordered the Farinata as an appetizer based on other reviewers comments and photo's.  It was exactly what others have said, basically a potato pancake...green onion's, olives baked in... delicious and we ate it all.    My Mom ordered the Tonnarelli, which was a square spaghetti pasta with garlic and light tomato sauce and Pecorino cheese.   I ordered the Slow Cooked Beef Brisket.   Both were excellent dishes, relatively simple in preparation but flavorful and farm fresh and big portions.  The house made pasta is tender and cannot be mistaken for anything but freshly homemade.  The Beef Brisket was tender enough to cut with a fork and was perfectly seasoned.  We took about half of both dishes home.  It's a relatively slow dining experience, because they bring out each dish as a course.  We did not intend to eat family style (I actually hate family style dining, unless you are with FAMILY, luckily that was the case).  The next time I would ask them to bring the Primi and Secondi course at the same time, just because we were there for almost two hours.  I also ordered the sky potatoes with garlic and rosemary, nothing special about these they are pan fried potatoes, but they were \"simple\" good.    Complimentary bread olive oil + small plate of fire grapes and sausage slices + Farinata (Antipasti - \"Appetizer\") + Pasta (Primi - \"First Course\"), Brisket (Secondi - \"Main Course\")... Potatoes (Contorni - \"Sides\")  is too much food for two average people.  Luckily they didn't have or didn't offer dessert last night.   We will totally come back here, but the meal was a little heavy for summer, so it probably won't be two/three times a month like our other regular spots.  Food was top notch, and service was also on point for us, server explained each dish like a pro because there is a lot of foodie/Italian wording. OH and Chris Bianco was in the house and checked on us and thanked us for dining there."}
{"text":"Okay, one of the more diverse food experiences I have had... At a table for four we shared various items including these amazingly thin pork chops that were to die for. It is too bad they don't post a menu on their web site but don't let that stop you from going in and experiencing the same adventure we had. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am well aware that my opinion of Tratto is not the popular opinion....but what can I say? I just didn't think this place was all that special. I made a reservation well in advance. My friend and I arrived and were seated right away (the place was fairly empty for a restaurant with no availability going out a week or two). The restaurant is very bright and feels welcoming. We started with cocktails, which were the highlight of the meal. Their turmeric cocktail was very tasty (though on the pricey side for the size and amount of alcohol). We were also given complimentary cheese and olives, which were tasty. We decided to share a couple items to get a feel for the food. We shared the farinata (as recommended by our waiter) and it was just ok..... a bit on the greasy/salty side. I enjoyed one piece, but really didn't want more of it. We also ordered the butternut squash filled pasta which was hugely underwhelming. The food was fresh, but it lacked flavor and the portion was tiny! The real kicker was the price.... we paid over 30$ each...for one drink, half a pasta, and half an app....that's insane and this food just wasn't good enough to warrant the price. I won't be back."}
{"text":"small but focused menu.  ordered one of their seasonal salads and pasta dishes that made a perfect dinner.    con: service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Oh, my God - Chris Bianco, will you prepare everything that goes in my mouth?  The fact that this lovely little restaurant is in a strip mall is borderline ridiculous.  Everything is hand-made, local, organic, blah blah blah who cares?  This is the best restaurant in Arizona."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we had a great time here and we had the chicken, potato's,cauliflower along with farinata. Everything was great. The owner stopped by and asked us if were enjoying the w. Chris Bianco is a wonderful chef and owns the pizza place next door. It is the number one pizza place in the USA. Our friends that we were visiting saw Martha Stewart eating at the pizza place about a month ago. Both places are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tratto is amazing! Quaint little place with GREAT service and amazing food! Bianco has done another great job with this one. The oil is AMAZING."}
{"text":"In the tradition of pizzeria bianco, a great new version of 'italian restaurant' 2.0 (maybe phx Wasn't ready for that a few yrs back!). A little pricey but great simple menu featuring what you'd expect from the person who changed the face of phx restaurants himself (sorry fox & LGNO!). A can't miss if haven't tried."}
{"text":"The unpretentiousness of the food at Tratto speaks volumes about Chris Bianco's talent. This man has won countless James Beard awards, the New York Times wrote an encomium about his pizza alone, and he is a culinary giant in the local community. But walking into Tratto, none of this was obvious. The menu is simple. Local ingredients, fresh food, and attention to detail ensure that Bianco's Tratto delivers a high-quality experience without the frills and distractions of other restaurants in the same echelon.  We started with the farinata and two salads. The farinata is perfectly flaky, smoky in flavor, and complex in a subtle way. It was by far the most delightful dish of the night, and I would come back JUST to eat it again. The lemon paparadelle was another standout dish, with its delicate flavors and charred broccolini. The pasta is fresh and perfectly balanced. This dish proves that one need not drench a pasta in sauce or olive oil for it to have flavor--just a few simple ingredients of high quality can go a long way. I would also recommend the broccolini plate, where the perfectly bitter vegetable is the star of the show, complemented by red chili flakes and smooth olive oil. Don't skip out on dessert. I could literally write poetry about the apple crostata and its flaky, buttery, pillowy deliciousness.  Pick up the phone and make a reservation. Right now. It's not every day in Phoenix, Arizona, that you get a chance to enjoy a culinary experience of this caliber."}
{"text":"The man, the myth, the legend continues! Huge Bianco fans always have been and this spectacular restaurant does not disappoint! The ambiance is fantastic designed in his usual eclectic manner only enhanced with amazing paintings from his father all around the dining room. The open kitchen enables you to see the fresh ingredients being prepared while still having a nice conversation at your table. One downside is the noise level making it hard to hear everyone (in a party of 6). That is overlooked because the food is amazing; the chef has really out done himself, again! The wine menu is fantastic as well serving great bottles of local Arizona vineyards and nice Italian wines as well. You know it is a hotspot when other local chefs and restaurateurs are sitting amongst you...job well done!"}
