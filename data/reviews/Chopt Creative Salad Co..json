{"text":"I can build my salad with lots of toppings. It was good - didn't knock my socks off but it was good. I like that they have several leafy options - More than I've ever seen. The dressings were okay. I believe they could increase the flavor with seasonings to add in like garlic, Italian seasoning, paprika, pink salt, etc."}
{"text":"Chopt is great, the only issue is there is always a long line because everyone else thinks the same thing.  The salads are huge, filling, customizable and inexpensive.  For the same money as a fast food value meal you can get a fresh salad.  Just allow yourself time if you are going during the dinner hour or on weekends."}
{"text":"Love the new Spicy Korean Town Noodle  salad bowl. Spicy Dressing    They should keep this one on permanent menu"}
{"text":"This review is only for to go orders using the relatively new app. I have used the app about 5 times now and have been very disappointed. Everytime I have used it, my salad has not been ready at the pickup time. This defeats the purpose of using the takeout app. If I wanted to wait for my salad, I would just order in line.  The bigger issue is the quality of the salads when using the takeout app. The salads are rarely chopped and have either no dressing or way too much dressing. I usually get a salad that comes with avocado and everytime I have ordered it, the full avocado is just sitting on top of the salad not chopped or mixed in at all.  It appears to me the quality of takeout salads is much lower than if you wait in line due to the fact that there is someone in the back making them in a half assed manner. I am very happy that they have this takeout option because the line can get pretty long. However, they need to start treating the preparation of the salads in the same manner as if they were making the salad in front of the customer in the store."}
{"text":"Consistently a good experience. Lots of salad choices plus soups. Line goes quickly and great selection of teas. The Ballantyne location is clean, employees helpful and store has an attractive interior."}
{"text":"The Chicken Tinga Bowl with the California Goddess dressing is TO DIE!!!! My absolute favorite thing at Chopt! I get it at least twice a week!"}
{"text":"I like to think I brought this franchise to Charlotte when I moved here from DC. But truthfully I owe a lot to whomever did!  Best Salad In The World!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say, but it was a bit disappointing. The pictures and ingredient lists look amazing, but the actual food was not representative of the depictions. The salads were just average, did not have much flavor, fell flat."}
{"text":"Delicious salad. I love getting the Mexicali vegan. However, their operations are terrible. Instead of waiting in the super long line that is always there, I order to-go through their app. Their app is not the greatest. The part that annoys me though is probably 80% of my to-go orders are wrong. Missing ingredients, missing salad dressings, ingredients I didn't ask for, etc. I keep going back because the salads are good but they really need to work on their efficiency."}
{"text":"I like Chopt.  However, do not use their iOs application to order in advance.  I have done this four times and EVERY time the salad bowl is at least 1/3 less full.  Hate to stand in line...but at least you get a full salad."}
{"text":"I've always been a chopped salad lover but Chopt, Park Road takes things to a new level. Great choices, incredibly helpful and friendly staff...love it! Have established first name relationship basis with many of the folks there including Tim and Jim-so gracious!   I took my sister there this evening and they offered special offerings for her vegan meal including special preparations of the chopping area. My kids (ages 11 and 8) have eaten salad more this past week then their entire lives because they love it so much.   Lines are always long but the process is very efficient. Easy in and out. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Insane customer service!  Food is super fresh and creative. This will be a several time a week spot for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great location, great selections and fresh. I like that you have different options regarding the amount of dressing that's tossed in your salad vs getting it on the side and then you try to mix it in at your table, never works out. My favorite.....Kale Caesar, must try even if you normally do not care for a Caesar Salad.  I only gave it a 4 because it's pricey, very pricey for a salad place, needs to come down a bit."}
{"text":"I ordered a BOWL of the spicy corn chowder for $6.49. What I received was a small bowl, not even filled halfway with soup. Seriously, there could not have been 3/4 a cup of soup in the bowl for nearly $7.00! I can only imagine what a cup is served in; a shot glass?   I have never refused to pay for an order of food before, but today I did. That is how ripped off I felt. Corn chowder! There wasn't one expensive ingredient in that tiny bowl for them to justify serving such a ridiculous portion.  The salads, on the other hand, looked more appropriate for the price charged. However, I did not order a salad. This review is based on what I did order."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first visit and I absolutely love the concept! Everyone was friendly and patient as well. Eating healthier just got easier! I got the Santa Fe minus the protein. It was delicious as well as the tahini-type of dressing. They let you sample multiple salad dressings if it's your first time. It was slightly busy for 6pm on a Sunday. I'll definitely be back during non-busy hours. I can see these salads getting slightly expensive if you get the ones with more \"stuff\" in it, but for the quality and amount you're getting, it's a good deal! Plus, they offer you a complimentary piece of bread. I hope they open up more locations in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Wished I lived closer as this would definitely be a spot I would come to multiple times a week!   For those who don't know you can turn the salad into a wrap which is a hit for my husband!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Large portions, excellent quality ingredients, and really friendly enthusiastic staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"For a man's man who hates salads since they're usually a wet crunchy pile of cold iceberg lettuce, this is a nice hearty heaping of heaven and Kale. Love it. Every time."}
{"text":"I must not be hip enough to appreciate this place. I won't go into a whole rant but I'll leave you with 2 words...SALT & PEPPER!! The pre-prepared chicken needs some type of seasoning. It's disgusting. I paid almost $14 for a salad...surely you can afford some salt & pepper!!  Service was great but will not go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"awesome awesome awesome!!!! I absolutely love this place, I will be back again and again and again.  I probably wouldn't recommend this place if you're starving and need instant food gratification.  Save that for a drive-through.  If you want to just get a really good lunch or dinner made your way, Chopt is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Third visit to Chopt, third time of great customer service!  The workers are always engaging, and chatty (which I love).  BUT today it was even better as a coworker I was with thought she left her phone at the counter after we sat down.  Unfortunately it wasn't up there when she went back, and the manager and workers took her info.  The manager then walked all the way back down to Caribou Coffee just because that is where my coworker said she was last....to look for her phone!  Who does that??!?!?!  I was blown away by this amazing customer service gesture, and the Manager Jim deserves more than a shout out.  What a great example of customer service.  Chopt, I will be back!  The phone was later found in her car....in case you were wondering."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. I love this place. I try to avoid eating out a ton, and I still wind up here at least once a week. I love that I can customize my salad to my exact preferences, and that the ingredients are all fresh and (relatively) healthy. Employees are a mixed bag, with some being super helpful and welcoming and others who are obviously unhappy about having to make your salad. The line process is also super confusing, but just be prepared to be herded a bit while ordering your salad and you'll be good to go. Honestly, I don't even care because their salads are just that good."}
{"text":"I loved the concept of the restaurant , I got an expensive Bowl of lettuce...  they were skimpy on the other veggies and chicken ....  two salads and 2 drinks , almost $30.   We should have had an unbelievably yummy salad .  Greatly underwhelmed ..   won't go back.... Would have had a better salad at chick fil a"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"SPICY NEW MEXICO CAESAR\" Destination Salad.  Unless the purple cabbage and avocado were minced to a miniscule size, they did not exist in the salad.  It appears to be a salad with scant masa chips, 95% chopped romaine and some shreds of chicken.  The dressing is very spicy ( a plus); however, the scant featured ingredients (as stated in the menu) are a tremendous disappointment.  I hope their other menu items are not as deceptive/misleading."}
{"text":"Great concept for healthy eating. It was my first time here and there was so much to choose from on the menu. It was a fast moving line and I didn't have much time to really figure out the menu and my choices. I would recommend looking at the menu online before you go. Good food with a lot of choices."}
{"text":"The woman behind the counter was very friendly & super helpful. This was my 1st visit & she didn't rush me, made great suggestions for substitutions. (It was late afternoon so not their busiest time, but still steady traffic). I ordered the Santa Fe with TexMex ranch. Amazing! I love that the salad is chopped, then they mix it just enough to toss the dressing. I'm that person that always manages to make a mess while cutting up my salad, so this is perfect for me. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I wish something this great was a little more affordable. $24 for 2 salads isn't something I could do on a regular basis. But I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really like the concept and it's definitely new to Charlotte. The Chicken Caesar Kale Salad was excellent and the prices aren't bad at all!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times before and really want  to give it five stars but a bowl of lettuce for $10 is just not gonna cut it.  Prior visits had plenty of toppings  but today's visit had little to none. I used the app to order so I didn't see my salad being made but when I received it I had to question my order because I didn't see anything but lettuce. Even dressing was questionable, maybe a dab at best.  Too pricey to make a habit."}
{"text":"Great  salad. The food is five stars but i took off a star because of the chop line system. But just because i dont like it doesn't mean it doesn't work. I plan on being a regular."}
{"text":"Excellent costumer service, the manager Bill is amazing, he explained to me all the options I have and my mistake I ordered a very spicy salad, he changed for another one at not cost, salads are fresh and they  are made at the moment, everybody was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.   A dizzying array of choices to build your own salad.  Plenty of protein items and grains are offered to make it filling.   I believe they have soups as well.   Take your time to read the boards in order to get an idea of what you'd like.  You go through the line, pick out your salad and toppings and then it gets passed to the person who chops it all up and presents it to you.  The portions are big!!"}
{"text":"I've upgraded my stars from 3.5 to 5!  There were a few kinks when they first opened but this is now my go-to place for fresh, fast casual salads.  I come 2-3 times a week.  I love the Braised Chicken Tinga and Braised Greek (hot topped salad with grain)!  So much flavor!  You can't go wrong with either the Mexican Goddess or Lemon Tahini dressings.  The Santa Fe, Po' Boy and Kebab Cobb are runner-ups.  Sometimes their season \"destination salads\" have a gem.  I'm currently obsessed with the Moroccan Harvest...goat cheese, dates, pomegranate seeds and croutons!   Love the vibe here.  Everyone is so friendly!  Love that they source locally too.  Just go!  You will never go back to Panera again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch- despite being in a hurry. While waiting, Brandon approached me & offered a menu. I reviewed the menu before joining the increasingly long line to order. Brandon politely suggested a few salads and stood close by in case I had questions. I explained  that I was in a hurry and decided to leave & go elsewhere when he asked if I knew what I wanted. I told him, he went over to ask another employee, Jo-el to prepare my salad. Within 5 minutes, I had my salad and utensils and was heading out the door. I arrived for my meeting ahead of schedule. The salad was delicious. THANK YOU BRANDON & JO-EL FOR EXCELLENT SERVICE! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A very creative way to be healthy. I loved the salad I got. Their drinks are expensive though for such a small variety."}
{"text":"So, so good!! They are willing to make the salad how ever you want. The person I was sharing it with didn't want the same dressing I did and the sweet woman accommodated our high maintenance needs. Really awesome atmosphere, great staff and wonderful product! Very pleased- wish there were more locations near by."}
{"text":"Finally decided to give this place a try and I'm a fan!  First time I had the Cobb salad and I was pleased to see that they packed the salad and toppings in and weren't stingy at all.  They ask you what level of chop't you want and they also allow you to let them know how much dressing to put on it.  You can make your version of a salad or you can pick from their signature salads or grain and noodle bowls.  I was certain that after my cobb salad I would be hungry in a couple of hours but I wasn't!  It was quite filling.  We even got a slice of bread to go with the salad.  My daughter got the Kale Caesar and my friend got the cobb for herself and the salmon bowl for her hubby.  Yumminess all around!  We returned today, three days later and got the Kale Caesar again and my other daughter got the Santa Cruz quinoa bowl.  Today the person making it was a bit stingy with the ingredients on the Santa Cruz bowl and they only put a 1/4 piece of avocado in it whereas you get a half avocado in the cobb salad.  They wanted to charged $1.99 for another quarter avocado which I think is just insane but the guy was nice enough to just add a little extra since we didn't know it would be so costly.  That extra piece would put the bowl at over 12 bucks and the bowls are not that big. The Kale Caesar is $6.29 and the Cobb and Santa Cruz bowl are $10.29.  Despite that, the salads are very good and the Santa Cruz bowl, though pricey and a bit lacking on portion size, was delicious! The Kale Salad was delish but it would be great if they added a tad bit more cheese because once you get it all chopped up the small amount of cheese gets lost.  They do have the option of you choosing your greens and up to 4 toppings from a specific category but if you like a lot of stuff in your salad it can get a bit pricey.   I feel like this place is like Chipotle and your experience can hang on whether have you a tight fisted employee or not. You know the ones who act like if they give you even one extra grain its coming out of their paycheck? LOL!!  With the prices, they'd be good to err on the side of generosity in order to make customers want to come back again.  My first visit I definitely felt okay with the price because they were generous and the second visit, not so much and we didn't get any bread. The food was still yummy.  Let's hope the third time is like the first.  I'll let you know.  That is all!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Moving recently from Seattle, I have been missing the variety of healthy lunch options.  Was so excited to stumble upon this place.  It's a bit of a drive for me to get to on my lunch hour, but I've been trying to get here at least once a week.  Great variety, and love everything I have tried!  The Destination salads are great, love that there always seems to be something new to try.  Hoping more locations open up around south Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"First of all, I love the concept and flavors of Chopt, regardless of location.  We have visited the Park Rd. location in Charlotte several times as it is a little closer, but we were pleasantly surprised that this location was a little larger and a little less busy.  I cannot say enough about the great flavors, healthy options, informative nutritional information (calories and labeling for vegan, gluten free, etc.), and the competitive pricing.  I usually create my own and can keep the cost under $10 for an amazing salad.  The staff are friendly, the produce is fresh, and the free flavored water is stupendous!"}
{"text":"Love Chopt!  Plain and simple, one of the best places to get a salad.  Great fresh options, you can easily build your own salad for $10.  The lone downside of this location is that it is absolutely always packed!  The great nutritional labeling (calories, vegan, gluten free, etc.) is extremely helpful.  Ordering the first time can be a little daunting, but this is a go to place when friends are passing through town or I want a quick healthy meal.  Love Chopt!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Creole Shrimp Bowl and it was delicious! I had to make a few adjustments and they accommodated me accordingly. It is a bit pricey but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Chopt is such a great addition to the Park Road shopping area.   I swung by for lunch on Saturday to grab two salads to go. My biggest complaint (which is a good thing for the business) is the line. There seems to always be a long line. This day was no different. The line was right at the door and was about a 15-20 minute wait. Kinda a bummer when you are just trying to get food to go.  The salad topping chooses are abundant. They also don't skimp on toppings...for example, a half an avocado is a serving! In the past, I have tried many of their salads, including some of the hot grain ones. However, this time I just opted to create my own. One of the salads, we got the Mexican Goddess dressing. It is a spicy avocado based dressing that was great. The other salad had the 5 Flavor Asian. Contrary to the name, this dressing was lacking a bit of flavor....ok, alot.   The portion sizes are ginormous. If you are craving salads, you will get it here! My total with a drink came to about $22. A bit on the pricey end considering I didn't have meat in my salads (just veggie toppings and avocado) but the salads are very filling. Opt for a drink, they make some amazing teas and lemonades!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try, but it did not live up to the hype. I went in after the dinner rush on a Saturday so it was not crowded, however the employees seemed impatient and were not very helpful for a first time visitor. When I asked opinions about the dressings, rather than give any to help me decide they simply read the ingredients out of a book. My salad was bland and ended up not having much taste. It was surely not worth $13, at all. I will sadly not go back, even though I love a healthy, grab and go type place like this."}
{"text":"First timer at this restaurant. Excellent first experience! Fun atmosphere, friendly, knowledgable staff, and so many salad options to choose from! A bit overwhelming at first. I might suggest looking up the menu online first, if you have time, so you're not standing in line for 10 minutes trying to figure out what you want (like I did)... but I can't imagine any impulsive menu choice being a bad one here!  I finally landed on the Kale Caesar Salad with chicken and creamy Caesar dressing. Best salad I've ever eaten. Every ingredient was so fresh. It was fun to watch them make it, but even better to scarf down!  The managers were present, extremely kind and helpful. I appreciated the staff's recommendations and can't wait to try something different next time!"}
{"text":"This is the place I've been dreaming off. Whenever I get a salad at a restaurant I spend so much time cutting up and mixing my salad that others I'm with are half way through their meals before I even start eating, lol. At Chopt, I get a huge chopped and dressed salad ready to eat. The ordering system looks a little hectic but is actually pretty time efficient considering they are getting a ready to eat, dressed salad to you. The people there were extremely nice and hard working. Great choice of dressings. I plan to eat here again and again. Please build a Chopt in Fort Mill!"}
{"text":"A friend brought me here during a recent trip to Charlotte.  I never ate at a Chopt restaurant because I was turned off by the idea of eating tiny bits of salad.  I have to be able to fold the leaves, its just my thing.  Anyway, I was holding up everyone in-line, trying to decide what to order, when the manager, David, kindly approached me and offered his assistance.  He made a few suggestions and I came away from register with a very tasty salad.  The leaves were also the perfect size.  Really impressed by the quality of service.  Nice Job!"}
{"text":"After spending an entire afternoon on a plane & arriving in Charlotte famished, I discovered this place & happily ordered the Mediterranean salad to go. When I got to my rental car with it, the stench of garlic was so overwhelming, I started to feel queasy.  I arrived at my friend's house with food in hand....the reaction there was so overwhelming, we  had to wrap it untouched In a garbage bag & take it outside to the trash.   $10+ wasted.  I then ate a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to grab a quick bite. The mexican caesar is my go to and I have it at least a couple of times a week. I had heard about this place from friends in NY and DC and I'm so glad they decided to expand to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Overwhelming experience for my first time, I felt rushed and there wasn't a huge line behind me. The concept is great and it was a huge portion of salad that left me beyond full. The salad options are like no other I've seen but are good and can be personalized. Served in a bowl with a quality lid for take out and on the go. Definitely recommend checking out the menu before you go. Overall good quality ingredients and fast service."}
{"text":"If you are into salads you will love this place.  I am typically on a raw diet and their Mexicali Vegan is really a treat. It is a big salad which is what I like. The atmosphere is good and it is cool to watch them make your salad. There are a lot of options to choose form. I sometimes choose the delivery service when I want to stay at work and this has been a great option for me. I am glad that I found this place."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place and gave it a try. What a huge disappointment. I ordered the caprese which had peaches, romaine, mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, mint and some crunchy quinoa with a mint basil balsamic dressing. If it hadn't been for the free piece of bread I would have still been hungry. $11 for this tiny salad and not a single piece of protein!! The container was half empty. What a rip off!!  I'd rather go to the Harris Teeter salad bar which is spectacular.  This place is highway robbery and over hyped. Never again. Yes the ingredients are fresh and the taste was great but what about filling up my container to justify $11? Shameful to say the least."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to lunch spots. I have been here several times since it opened and it never disappoints. Even when it's super busy, the line moves quickly and the staff are friendly. Great ingredients, great staff, great service. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love chopt! The salads are phenomenal. I've tried a few, and they have all been very fresh with a wonderfully balanced mix of ingredients and flavors. I could eat here every day. This location has a large, beautiful space."}
{"text":"Good food but do not do takeout.  These people are completely incompetent.  I've had my order wrong literally 7 to 8 times.  Not going back anymore"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying Chopt is my favorite casual restaurant in Charlotte. However, this location is my least favorite. As soon as I walked in it did not feel welcoming and the restaurant had a sewage smell. The line did not move fast and everything seemed chaotic with the workers. Providence and Park rd are much nicer locations and I will stick to those."}
{"text":"Love this salad place! Its so quick, easy, and healthy! I usually do the make your own salad and oh my the portions are HUGE! I almost always want to tell them to not put so much because they always load up the salad SO big!!  The place is clean, the staffs are friendly and the salad is yummy! No complaints here =)"}
{"text":"Okay.. the food is good, the service is quick and the staff is helpful. Portions are bigger than necessary and so are the prices. It'd be nice if both portions and prices were reduced by 30-40% or if they offered \"half size\" portions. Not a great place for kids unless they were born on a planet where kids under 12 eat green leafy vegetables. The staff were accommodating and at least tried to make something kids might like."}
{"text":"Tried the Santa Fe Salad and it was quite tasty! The corn chowder was also very good. Went during lunch on a Saturday and it was very crowded. The line moved quickly and all the employees were very friendly. They even had some one handing menus to patrons in line and answering questions about the menu. Great first impression!"}
{"text":"Chicken Tinga salad bowl...cabbage, kale, spinach, quinoa (could of had more) avocado, cotija cheese, tortilla chips, Mexican goddess dressing... just to name some of the ingredients...trying something new! Love the chopping stations. Downloaded the app and paid that way and it took $3 off!"}
{"text":"I love salad!! I could eat salad for every meal of the day and if you feel the same way look no further for a salad place because Chopt has you covered! I don't live close to this place but I will make a special trip for these salads!   So my first time going here was rush lunch hour, silly me right? Well that's what I was thinking while walking up to the door and saw a line beginning to wrap around the place. I had to see what all the fuss was about so I waited. The long line gave me some time to decide on what I wanted, or so I thought, the line moves very quickly no matter how long it may seem so I suggest have in mind what you'd like or you might feel a little overwhelmed. They have options for everyone, you can even build your own, choosing from their countless fresh ingredients and dressings. They even have already designed salads that you can choose from as well. After choosing they hand you a ticket and ask you to stand in a chopping line while they fill your bowl with all of your yummy ingredients and pass it down to your designated \"chopper\" who then chops all your ingredients   together  along with your dressing of choice. They make sure  you are getting your desired amount of dressing as well as make sure your salad is being chopped to your desired \"choptness\". The salads are huge and will be sure to fill you up, even have some for later. I decided to try the mexican caesar and the entire salad was amazing if you are a fan of spicy food this one is for you! I also had the California steak house salad which was THE BOMB!! and  will probably be my new go to. You can take your salad to go or you can sit in and eat, there is plenty of seating available and even some in the back for larger groups. I love this place so far the staff is great and very friendly. I will be back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! The operating partner Jim saw me struggling with my baby carrier, he found us a seat and helped get us through the line as easily as possible. Not to mention the amazing salad I had while I was there.  A great lunch despite the busy noon time rush.  We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Deliciousness in a plastic to-go bowl. I can't believe I'm saying this but I think the portion size might actually be a little too large. I'd be happier with a little less portion size and a slightly smaller bill. The flavor and freshness are exceptional."}
{"text":"I thought panera bread or chipotle made good salads but I was wrong. This place is awesome! And you can double meat your meat choice as well!!!!! You can either order one of their salads or make your own and it comes with bread... Yessssssssss!!!!!!  I kept it simple and ordered one of their options: the chicken tinga salad: double meat. I Cosby finish the whole thing. It has kale, a great amount of kale,cabbage, tortilla, etc...they chopped it all at your preference. Add the dressing , I chose the chimichurri ranch and it was different and good. Then they add the meat option...you can tell and taste the meat and ingredients are all fresh and organic. This was so good I wish they have Chopt at airports to eat healthy."}
{"text":"Absolute gem of a place. Awesome fresh salads with any topping you can imagine. Make it your own custom type deal. I love this chain so much that I went here on my trip to NYC as well.   Employees are super nice."}
{"text":"I love this place! The salads are phenomenal and made with the freshest ingredients. The staff is upbeat and friendly. Management staff is always present to Greet customers and offer assistance or suggestions. The facility appears clean and the atmosphere is always welcoming. I'm working mt way through the menu and haven't crowned a favorite yet. However, the braised chicken tinga is a front runner. I hear from the grapevine that Chopt is giving Cantina 3511 a run for its money!! Step up your game Cantina or find another location. Chopt is taking over this location! !"}
{"text":"Be careful if you have food allergies. My food allergies were clearly stated to the staff, and they still served me a salad containing my allergens. The manager was nice and offered to refund me, but it doesn't fix the fact that I now am having an allergic reaction because of their lack of care. I'll never be back, and I hope others with food allergies never have to deal with this."}
{"text":"First time here and I needed a little assistance on how to order and choose my salad. Everything is freshly made right in front of you and the choices were a little overwhelming for me.  Luckily, I was guided through and think that I could easily become a regular customer here if I lived in the area.  I like salads and I hate getting pieces of greens and veggies that are too big.  Here your salad is chopped to your satisfaction.  Soups are also on the menu."}
{"text":"Over priced, small selection, minced salad, not fresh but old.  Create a salad- The ingredients were overcooked or aged. They didn't even ask how I'd like the leafy greens and salad toppings, instead poured it into the table and shredded it to pieces and poured out into a bowl. For one big massive mush combo.   The dressings were also only mediocre at best. I got the vinaigrette that was only ok.   At the cash register after you pay, they ask you if you'd like a slice of bread with it. I said yes. It was chewy and nothing special. One taste and I was done."}
{"text":"A salad version of chipotle. It was fast service for a crowded place, fresh produce and very filling. You get to choose what kind of salad you prefer and then they bring it over to a chopper and he chops it up into the perfect pieces and adds as much dressing as you want. The price was great and they give you a piece of complimentary bread for free. For drinks they have 4 or 5 different teas or cucumber lemon water. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a healthy place to have lunch with friends and talk or are in a hurry but want a healthy meal."}
{"text":"I am a Chopt Fan all around and when I read about the Grand Opening FREE salad with a donation to Red Cross I was all in.  I usually am a 5 star reviewer for Chopt because it's just my FAVORITE salad place however I will have to say the young lady who took care of me was NOT ready for the crowd. She was very short and wouldn't listen to anything I said she had to dump salad twice because she was rushing and half listening. I want to give it a pass but she then became rude and walked over to the salad station where my salad was to be chopped without notifying me where I would be going. I totally was annoyed but another staffer who was excited about the crowd jumped in and made it all better.  This location is a nice size, I LOVE the decor the open floor plan and the different communal table settings.  This location will more than likely become my go to location all because of where it's located. There are a lot of places I shop for home products in the Arboretum like Bed Bath and Beyond and Michaels so a salad and shopping can go hand and hand."}
{"text":"This was my first visit at Chopt and they did not disappoint. Let's talk about how huge this salad is. One salad is large enough to feed a family of three. My daughter and I both ordered the chicken caesar salad. I added a lil bit of Mexican Caesar dressing and omg it gave the salad the right amount of kick. I ate on this salad for two days. I can't wait to go back and try something new."}
{"text":"Last two times I was in the restaurant was very dirty, everywhere. No management overseeing at 7:15 on a Friday night. The food prep / kitchen area was really disgusting. counters not cleaned, floors a mess. I ordered salad and threw it away because I couldn't eat it after looking around. I did not want to get sick. Come on guys, great concept but get a professional restaurant manager in there. I was surprised it was so dead when I walked it, now I'm not.   Sorry to have to post this!"}
{"text":"Excellent salad place with delicious flavors, and healthy options! My favorite is the spicy Santorini bowl with chicken, and I switchover romaine for kale. I love the quinoa and chicken combination for the spicy salad. I also enjoyed the palm salad, and the classic cobb. They have nice options from making your own salad to subbing ingredients.  I also added kalamata olives. They also make awesome lemonade! The lunch crowd was busy but the staff kept the lunch line moving."}
{"text":"The lighting, The Salad, The staff, The location Ooh did I mention the SALAD & the LOCATION??   I have long awaited the arrival of this location after discovering the location on Park Rd. After falling in LOVE with Chopt and meeting the mangers at the Park location and discussing expansion over a salad I anxiously awaited the opening of this Blakney location and today was the day that we decided to dine out for dinner and what better FASTFOOD (Anything I don't cook is FASTFOOD) to have than a SALAD.   I had a Chicken Tinga (No Chicken- sub with Tofu), my daughter had a Caesar Salad & my hubby had a create your own salad. The Mexican Goddess Dressing is THE TRUTH & the White Balsamic as well.   Even ran into Brendon Haywood (former NBA player and currently a commentator for sports) on our visit.   This place is awesome I LOVE the lighting as its well lit and has more seating than the other location. I'm super HAPPY with this location :-)"}
{"text":"I adore Chop't. I always frequent when I'm in DC, and I'm thrilled to have one now in Charlotte. The day I tried it, I was wowed by the friendliness of staff, the clean/modern/comfortable interior and the taste of the salad. I was a little disappointed in the pricing and the lack of availability of several of my choices (falafel, falafel crisps). I would've chosen the Falafel Cobb, but due to the lack of falafel, I built my own with a mix of greens, fried onions, avocado, blue cheese and feta with the Mexican Goddess dressing. It was heavenly, but definitely a pricey salad at over $10 (and no meat). Note that the avocado is a $1.99 upcharge. :/  I will be back, but I think the pre-designed options offer a better deal (for more toppings for the money than a make-your-own)."}
{"text":"Great salad with make your own style. I did the romaine, grilled chicken, then you get 4 add ins--I chose olives, carrots, goat cheese, walnuts with dijon vinaigrette.   I liked the flavor and the fresh veggies. The people were friendly and I ate healthy. It is a win win. Good food fast!"}
{"text":"Hmmm Hmmm Salad Goodness.. The atmosphere, the look, the options, the flavor, the staff (most of them 99%) all are Amazing.  I noticed a fellow Yelper who I'm friends with regularly check-in here and take amazing pictures of amazing looking salad. I bookmarked this place a short while back and after running some errands with my children we decided to check this place out to see what the hype was all about.  Well it was a great idea to do so, we arrived just in time as we had a wait but but was nothing like the line that formed while we were seated and eating.  I had one of the destination salads (La Chinesta) and my daughter a Caesar salad. The destination salads are limited time salads that they change often so I decided to try one of the destinations while they exist since the other salads are always there to try.   I LOVED the process from start to finish and the staff were all so informative and helpful. Customer service at its BEST, I had a small hiccup in my Happy FLOW that was quickly resolved by management. Not just one manager but two partners (owning partners) came over to our table to discuss and have great fun dialogue. Big ups to those gentleman as they didn't have to take the time out of their day (managing such an amazing restaurant and greeting the customers) to come over to us. Jim and Michael you are the real MVP's and I look forward to returning.  Before leaving I ordered the hubby a salad to go since he was at work and this chopper was EXTREMELY messy (most of the salad and toppings were flying to other stations) but hey messy taste God according to my husband when he ate his salad.   I also overhead management discussing the expansion with some others and I heard there will be one in Blakney in January which is a SCORE as that's really close to me (insert Happy Dance).."}
{"text":"Awesome service & healthy food! I enjoyed this location because I called ahead and was able to skip the line with salads to go. The service was great, they helped me select the make yr own ingredients over the phone."}
{"text":"Great find! If you're familiar with sweetgreens, then Chopt will be familiar. Took me forever to decide - the menu has lots of variation - but I'm very happy with my choice. I got the Braised Greek bowl and won't be hungry for hours. My chopper was super cool and considerate. She checked the dressing amount with me, and made sure I was happy. I'll be watching for more Chopt locations!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Chopt location a bunch since it opened in Park Road Shopping Center. It started out great, my first couple times were on point - that's why I've returned so many times!   The last 4-5 times I've been in or ordered through the app, my salad has been wrong. When I go in to order, the staff will ignore and not speak to me. Everyone that works there just seems like they do not care. Recently, they changed where to pick up the food when you order online. I haven't been in since then so when I go in the other night and ask the girl at the register all I get is a finger point to the shelf my food was on. No words, no smile, no nothing. Just a point. I'm sorry but I've worked in customer service all my life and you just don't treat people like that and except them to return.   On top of all of the bad customer service experiences and most of my orders being wrong, the salads have become just mediocre. AND they started cutting portions. So now you're paying $13+ for half of a tasteless, probably not made right, salad. It's just not worth it!  Chopt, we had a good run but now we must part. I hope you get it together because there is great potential!"}
{"text":"We visited Chopt for the first time on Black Friday.  It was super busy, but not so much that we had to wait long.  While it's a little pricier compared to the all-you-can-eat salad bar I can get across the street at Jason's Deli, Chopt offers a unique concept.  You pick the salad you want from their menu (or build your own) and then you're taken to one of the chopping stations with your designated chopper.  You watch in amazement as the chopper pulls out a machete-looking tool and goes to work on your salad.  You can have them chop it as much or as little as you want.  I stopped somewhere in between with my Cobb Salad.  I then opted for the healthier Greek yogurt tzatziki dressing instead of my normal blue cheese one, which turned out to be delicious, and I didn't even notice the difference.    It was pretty crowded inside and out, but we found a nice table right along the window, so we got to enjoy the sunshine.  The salads were sized \"just right\" for me, and it was fresh and tasty.  I'll definitely be back, but I wish their salads were priced a little bit lower for me to return more often."}
{"text":"Very interesting place ! We were greeted promptly as we entered. Although the lines were long, service was quick.  Food was great and customer service was beyond spectacular. No sugary drinks here."}
{"text":"I've been spoiled by SweetGreen in DC; a similar restaurant that specializes in the art of salad making.  This place uses local and seasonal ingredients to make the most amazing salads! When I'm eating a salad, the feeling that you're eating something so good and it's good for you is the hallmark of a winning salad. The addition of depth in the form a grilled or roasted veggies makes all the difference. Have you ever had grilled or roasted veggies over a bed of greens?! Yummmmm! I've found this combination to be the formula for feel good, taste good, and good for you salad. I saw only one roasted veggie, roasted butternut squash was listed in one of the salads. I  hope to see some grilled or pickled veggies offered once the season changes. My salad was one note with very little wow factor. I think the addition of more roasted and grilled veggies would be a game changer."}
{"text":"Unbelievable choices and fresh delicious food!  Probably one of my top 3 places in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"And the angels rejoiced! Finally Charlotte has a really great salad place!!! (Sorry, the holidays must be getting to me.) I can't say how impressed I am with this place and the management. Yes it takes 2x the people to make my salad than really needed. But the selection, quality and flavors makes the process totally worth it. They have a wide variety of flavor profiles and I love that they detail all calorie counts regardless if you have an add-on chicken, walnuts or Caesar dressing. I love the Mexicali Vegan Salad (360 cal) with add-on chicken breast and Sweet and Smoky Chipotle!   But what particularly impressed me is their attention to detail. I had asked my salad maker if the falafel had coriander or cilantro in it and she asked the manager. The manager came over and figured out immediately that I was allergic and started warning me about a bunch of different ingredients (avoid tabbouleh and southwestern quinoa) and even had my \"chopper\" (which reminds me of fluffer - heh heh) remove his whole chopping station equipment and bring in new because the middle-eastern chicken is marinated in coriander and he was worried about the juices. That is an unnecessarily detailed boring story but I was blown away by the precautions they took for little ol' me- it was totally unprecedented. So anyone else with allergies should definitely feel safe there. Bravo for your attention to the customer!   I will be a frequent customer and I hope they open up other locations or buy out Crisp!"}
{"text":"I've visited this location twice. The salads are always fresh. I just don't think I've found the right combination for my palate as of yet. But, the staff are always friendly. I love the fact that they always seem overstaffed. Reduces the wait when you have more people working.   Certainly plan to give it another go."}
{"text":"Just opened yesterday so I rushed over there today. Charlotte does not have a good salad place but chopt was amazing !! I got one of the hot-top salads and it was delicious. It was just the perfect amount of food and every worker was super nice."}
{"text":"Best damn salad I have had in a long time and the people here are awesome!!!!  I made mine personal. I got spinach, kale and arugula with grilled chicken and some spicy Chipotle sauce for a dressing.  Oh wow!!! It's almost wrong that a salad is this good!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem puts a fun and fresh spin on plain old salads. The line moves pretty quickly, once you order and, I'm guessing that it will continue to improve and speed up the expedition, once it's a tad more seasoned.   It's a nice fit in a nice strip mall and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Love the fresh options and dressings. A go to place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I haven't even tried my salad...but I'm gonna drop this review anyway. When I walked in I got a \"welcome to chopt\" or some such getting. Nowhere in the store does it tell you where to go and start the ordering process. I walked up to the cashier and she just said, \"you'll start down there\" and pointed. The gal making my salad was short (and I don't mean in height either), she felt the need to over explain, like I hadn't been staring at the menu over 3 minutes before deciding to order, and never once was I asked if they could assist in my decision making process. Once she crammed everything in my bowl I was sent on to the chopper, he was friendly enough. I grabbed my salad, dressing on the side and proceeded to the register...where there was no cashier...the chopper asked the salad gal about a cashier and she mentioned her name...still no cashier...no one stuck their head in the back to get her, no one called her name out...nothing...finally, a manager (who was interviewing someone?) asked if I was waiting to pay! I paid her for my salad and I was leaving the cashier came out of the back...no \"sorry, I didn't see you\" or anything even close to that. I don't care if this is the best $13 salad I've ever had, I will not be going back =("}
{"text":"Better experience second time a round - they seem to be figuring everything out! Plus, I downloaded the mobile app for $3.00 off my meal - great deal, you guys!  This time, I had the 7 Summits with soasted seasonal squash, charred red onion, pecorino cheese, quinoa, lentil & millet blend and kale, spinach & cabbage. I subbed edamame for the cheese. I love that they are so flexible with allowing that. Great salad all around, great customer service, and very friendly and accomodating staff members. They have someone greet you at the door, someone near the order line to improve efficiency and answer questions, and various customer interactions during the salad \"chopping\" process. Efficient teamwork and a great concept!"}
{"text":"selection of salads were varied from Mexican to Greek and California,all were made to order and excellent in taste.Customer  service was excellent."}
{"text":"Two salads with shrimp and avocado $31.00 now that is ridiculous  But it did taste great but not worth it. And that is with no drinks."}
{"text":"I'm already looking forward to my next trip here!   I was a little worried when I walked in the line was practically at the door! But everyone was friendly, the line was moving fast and as a newbie it gave me time to see other folks salads and decide on my very first one.   So many choices it's easy to get overwhelmed. But what I really liked is that the staff explains everything to you and you can easily make additions or substitutions to your custom salad as needed.   I decided to go with the Chopped salad because it basically had so many yummy ingredients I couldn't pass up. It's packed with chicken, ranch smoked bacon, an egg, blue cheese and tomatoes. I switched the dressing out for the Mexican Goddess and if your a fan of salad dressing's with a little kick I'd absolutely recommend it. Don't worry, you can sample the dressing before they out it in AND they ask you to let them know how much dressing you'd like on your salad. (Yep, you're totally winning here).   Just watching them make the salads is cool but what's better is that they are a good size portion with fresh and tasty ingredients.   Chop't you had me at hello.....see ya soon!"}
{"text":"I'm far from a salad person and I have to say that this place is awesome. The chicken tinga salad is ridiculously addictive. Some of the other salads have been great as well. They have some very healthy options. Great concept!"}
{"text":"Palm Beach is my go to choice!!! Very simple but fresh products for sure. Customer service is awesome. But $10 - $15 is very pricy for a salad.... but hey it is what it is for trying to eat healthy lol. The black or green tea is pretty good as well.  Pro tip: if you know you're going to go there often, go ahead and download the app. Spend $100 and get a free salad or $10 off (Don't quote me on that though). Trust me it is not hard or take a long time to spend $100 at Chopt lol. AVOID I repeat AVOID going there during lunch time... or you'll end up spending your entire lunch break in line (speaking from experience lol) Cutting the line by ordering through the app and earn some points lol #winwin"}
{"text":"Doesn't get 5 stars due to price of salad and lettuce not organic.  This review for new Blakeney location.  Overall food  is very good."}
{"text":"Very mediocre.  Over priced.  Nothing impressive.  For a fairly new place that serves a healthier option, it amazes me that ownership only post the calories (because they have to by law).  A lot of people want to know additional nutritional information.  You can tell not a lot of thought went into the concept.  They just put it in a high end location."}
{"text":"1st time:Slightly hectic, yet friendly service. Fresh, filling and tasty servings. Enjoyed the Kebab Cobb added grilled chicken (romaine, pita chips, local feta, charred red onions& spicy peppers with the Greek yogurt dressing)  Avoid 11:30-2:30pm-super long lines! Will definitely come again.   5/14/16- Ordered the same Spicy Caesar, but also tried raspberry lemonade this visit. Chills, diarrhea and vomiting have been on my plate for last 12 hours. Easy for cross contamination- order takers use same gloves to gather lettuces& toppings & choppers touch boards and mixing bowls. Really liked this place..."}
{"text":"Wow! Must say I'm impressed! Love the variety of greens, grains & veggies to choose from to create your own meal.  Highly recommend & definitely would visit again!"}
{"text":"It's not like when they first opened.....  We went for supper on a Friday evening and maybe there was 18-20 people??  One of the nice choppers said to everyone that came through the line - \"Sorry, we ran out of bowls\".... and so they literally piled up in this small To-Go container and it looked downright peculiar as they shoved all the ingredients (clown-car style) into the plastic takeout bowl.  I really liked the hard open bowls they were using when they first opened!!!  Granted, it was a decent portion however, the review from exactly one month ago clearly shows that diner eating \"IN\" while having the same small plastic bowl.  So clearly, they are not responsive to their own supply needs.                                ------------------------------- I was hungry and had a craving for some of that ZHUGG sauce that they drizzle on the \"Mediterranean\" so I ordered the KABOB-COBB and when I asked for the drizzle, I was told: \"Sorry, but we don't prepare that sauce anymore, the manager stopped it.\" So, like the flexible and accommodating Food Service Professional that I am, I went for the Chimmichurri (which was more creamy than churri.                                 ------------------------------- So, the kid (chopper) told me that they were going to be changing the menu tomorrow and that they routinely take things off and put things on the menu. So, you really can't go in knowing that you want a particular menu item, you should just be hungry for a fresh salad and then go from there...                                 --------------------------------  I found the food quality and portion sizes to be very good, we were a family of 4 and we were able to take some food home because as we all know, a half hour after salad we're hungry for more! ----------------------------- We, like the reviewer a month ago, found the woman who was working as cashier to be short and impatient and really shouldn't be the face of a company who values hospitality.  She mistakenly charged us for 5 bowls instead of 4 and my wife had to point out our children and myself because she was acting like we were trying to scam them.  I'm sorry, that was my fault, I'm going to fix it right now........ The mistake bill was $60 and you could hear my jaw hit the floor!! Corrected, the $50 bill was much better NOT. 4 salads, 1 drink and 2 mini-chips. -------------------------- So we sat at the Big Triangle Table that was shaped like a Galaxy Cruiser & asked each other if they still offer a slice of free bread and upon approaching the same woman, she looked at the table as if to say- so now you want more bread?? Again, we received the \"Sorry, we forgot to give you the bread. ---------------------------- I don't know about you, but when I'm paying $50 for salad for a family of four & I receive 4 separate \"I'm sorrys.....\" I'm going to give a thumbs down rating. --------------------------- MANAGEMENT.........IF YOU'RE LISTENING????  Your bowls are in the garbage, the opening of your trash cans is 1/2 inch wider than the circumference of the bowls, I found that out when you first opened and figured that you would eventually pay the price......or I would."}
{"text":"I am addicted to chopt salads and always choose chopt over any other salad place, but today i was so sad! My salad had barely any chicken and while i was eating it i would find other vegies that are not in my salad, but because the toppings were all over the place and my creator was in a rush because of the long line!  I hope that this does not happen just because its busy and you're trying to get everyones order in quickly!"}
{"text":"As someone who normally hates salad, this place has me hooked!  I sit all day at work and need to be conscious about what I eat.  Chopt's absolutely delicious salads have not only allowed me to keep my calories down and get my green vegetables every day, they also made me love salad!  And they have so many options that you never get tired of the place.  I've been going for lunch every day for the last 4 months, and yep, I'm going today!  If you hate salad, give this place a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"A tad overwhelming at first, but the salad was delicious nevertheless. I had the kebab Cobb, pretty good."}
{"text":"Everyone was exceptional! It's so nice to get good customer service. There was one specific gentleman at the food prep counter that was very helpful. I asked about the salad dressings and if they had sugar in them and he offered for me to look at a book with the nutrition index and ingredients. Then when I was checking out, I believe she was a manager (receipt says Name: Charytin F) was very nice and helpful also. Good conversation with her. She made sure I was happy with what I decide on. But throughout my whole experience everyone was great and checked on me while I was eating, making sure everything was good etc."}
{"text":"I am so excited that Chopt is finally open. It is a great addition to the area and has tons of fresh, healthy options. The lines during the lunch rush can look overwhelming but it typically moves pretty fast. The only issue is that sometimes it gets so crowded that it can be difficult to find a seat! Each time I've visited, every single person on the staff has gone out of their way to be friendly and to help make suggestions. Their salad portions are huge and I can usually take some to go for another meal. I'm a big fan of Chopt and can't wait for their other locations to open in the area."}
{"text":"I first heard of Chopt in DC. I always love their salads, and it doesn't hurt that they are huge. The people who work their are always so nice. I love the tea options as well."}
{"text":"Wow. Just walking in this place, I was transformed into another world. :D  I love a good salad & Chopt really has a good thing going. While making a decision on a \"built\" salad or \"build your own\", the employees here are really patient. I love being able to watch the salad being put together & watching the chopping action go down.  While the salads are a bit pricey, you get so much bang for your buck! I was able to make one salad last me for two meals. I got the steakhouse salad.   Love the design & layout of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I guess I just don't get it. And this is coming from a salad and veggie lover and lifelong vegetarian. If you want to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a salad that they pulverize with a big knife to make it look worth your money, go for it. The salad was good, but definitely not worthy of the price point. I got the Mexican Goddess bowl. I was really looking looking forward to the street corn on it, which ended up tasting like nothing. There were about three chips on it and the only ingredient that there was an abundance of was the pickled jalapeños which I had to pick out. I like spicy food and it was just too much. I wish I had gotten it to go because the to-go salads look a lot bigger, and the one they gave me in a bowl left me hungry an hour later. The crumb of free bread is laughable. The iced hibiscus was great. I will not be back."}
{"text":"My first time there and it was great. Very busy but the line moved fast. Great selection and the organic sweet tea was the best I have ever tasted. Would have given five stars but would appreciate the order takers to change sanitary gloves from taking orders to handling the salad greens and bowls."}
{"text":"It took me forever to try this place simply because there are so many options for salads I didn't understand what the big fuss was about. But my very first time I got the Santa Fe and added chicken and subbed the dressings for ranch and balsamic. It was so delicious and now I am addicted, I can admit it is alittle chaotic at times but the choppers remain calm and friendly."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  Even though its a bit of a drive over to Park Road Shopping Center, I try to get to CHOPT at least once a week!  OK, here's the lowdown on everything CHOPT...  If you've never been, just imagine a Chipolte, but for salads and you're good.  Parking shouldn't much of an issue, as this CHOPT location is in the heart of Park Road Shopping Center.  Def one of the busier shopping centers in CLT, but still should be able to find parking with no problem.  I must admit, I don't experiment very much here, so I've never had any of their bowls, or \"Destination Salads\" which seem to reflect the the tastes and foods of a particular region around the world.  I usually run the Classic Cobb or the Santa Fe - usually the Santa Fe.  The main thing you gotta know about the salads is you don't have to accept the bland, boring romaine it comes with!  And why would you, when you can get the CHOPT blend, or the kale, broccoleaf, purple cabbage blend??  I usually run the Santa Fe with half Chopt Blend & half kale, broccoleaf, cabbage w/ chicken (fried or grilled) - DELICIOUS!  There's something addictively good about these salads.      They give you a lot of salad, so I usually don't finish the entire thing at once.   The salads save well in the plastic containers they come with and are great to come back to after cooling in the fridge for a few hours.  Whether you choose to chill and eat it there - they have decent seating available or take it home, the freshness of the food permeates every tasty, crunchy bite!"}
{"text":"Wonderful salads  Kanisha helped us have a great experience. A bit crowded at peak times. Super fresh."}
{"text":"Good chicken tinga salad.  Filling and lots of great flavors!  My kid made her own salad, not knowing it would cost us $$$$14.  What???  That is crazy!!!!  Total rip off!!  This will be an occasion visit and no more making her own salad.  Disappointed for our first visit."}
{"text":"Chop't has so many salad options and the portions are plentiful. Great atmosphere. Definitely a place I would go on a special lunch date or when girlfriends are visiting in town, but wouldn't make it an every-week spot due to high prices for a salad."}
{"text":"Great new spot! I'm glad they came to my neighborhood. Have visited their other locations every many times, definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"Lots of really good salad  At first the menu looked a bit overwhelming but I quickly realized they have a lot of good salad ideas on there. You can also make your own creation but I tend to stick to the options they give (which are a ton)   They also let you try everything without even having to ask. I was concerned the peppers may be to hot but they let me try a few before they put them on the salad so I didn't have to guess if I'd want them or not!   I've had the southwest and the Kebob Cobb. Both were really good. The chopper suggested I mix the two dressings recommended for the salad I got (again let me try her special mix) and it was delicious so I was really appreciative of them taking the time to offer me a unique suggestion I wouldn't have thought of.   I tend to go in off times because I have a feeling it's very crowded at peak times.   The price can be a little high at $10ish dollars for a salad but they are huge and can last for two meals"}
{"text":"As I sit here and eat my salad from Chopt, I was compelled to write this review. Simply put, it's the best salad restaurant in Charlotte. The way they chop up your salad and mix in the dressing is just perfect. No more having your ingredients in separate places in your salad (which I hate) I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Thanks to another fellow Yelper who referred me to this place.  If you are looking for a full bodied  salad and with hundreds of fresh combinations this is the place. You have the ability to select from a wide variety of fresh lettuce, vegetables, fruits and beans. Everything is fresh.  The salad is prepared in front view while chopping everything into small bite size pieces. There are too many dressing to choose from to list but it defiantly has something to shock those taste buds.   Staff is friendly and quick however; be prepared to stand in line as the place is packed.   Treat yourself to something healthy yet satisfying."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of salads, bowls and ingredients! Everything was prepared and \"chopt\" right in front of us and we could customize anything we wanted! We'll definitely be back to try other menu items-I has the Mexican Caesar salad and hubby had the warm quinoa salad bowl.  Both were delicious and we can't wait to try more! The inside was large and clean with free \"spa\" citrus water at the entry. Cute outdoor patio seating, too!"}
{"text":"Was fortunate enough to hear that Chopt was having a limited free lunch serving on Wednesday and Thursday of this week. I snuck into the new location around 11:30am and was greeted by a friendly (manager?) who was helping direct the first-timers and show us the lay of the land.   A warning to newbies: expect this place to be very busy in the first upcoming weeks. Chop't has a bit of a cult following and rightfully so. Expect people to be a little bit slow in ordering until they get a hang of the layout. This is the south after all.   After standing in a long, but quickly moving queue, you order from a well-prepared selection of salad choices, as well as a make-your-own option. They also have a pretty awesome kids menu if that's your thing.  Now let me tell you, people come to this place for the ingredients. They are plentiful and so fresh and there are really so many different choices. I chose the Mexican Caesar salad which was appointed one of the \"first time favorites\". After ordering and customizing your choice, you and your salad are then assigned to a \"chopper\".   The \"chopper\" allows you to customize the type and amount of dressing/salt/and pepper, and then thoroughly mixes and chops it all together. Don't let the size of the bowl fool you, after they chop everything and smash it into the bowl...this is A LOT of salad. Think, hard to finish in one sitting sized salad. The guy next to me in line opted for the hot quinoa bowl option which looked totally delicious and will most certainly be one of the next choices I try when I get there.   At the register, this time they allowed us to enjoy the meal gratis, while suggesting a donation to a cool local charity: Green Teacher Network. Don't skip the drinks, because their sweet tea and lemonade sweetened with honey is not to be missed. Their dining room is small and noisy, but has a comfortable mix of booths and regular tables.   Thoroughly enjoyed the experience, the employees were friendly and quick, and you guys will definitely be seeing me again soon."}
{"text":"Time to brush up on all the different types of lettuce and veggies - and salad dressings.  Chopt has tons of varieties to choose from in every category.  You can choose to DIY your own salad, choose one of their pre-made recipes, or one of the monthly specials that feature a different destination.  The April country is Peru.  I was a bit taken aback during my first Chopt visit - I didn't realize that there was actually a chopping station.  My life is complete now.  Your first stop, you choose your lettuce, then you choose your proteins and veggies.  Then they send you to a chopper station.  That person chops your salad, helps you choose a dressing (ask for a taste if you can't make a decision), then they mix it all together.  Don't forget to get some complimentary bread and try some of their interesting drinks - organic black tea, raspberry lemonade, cucumber water."}
{"text":"If I could get past the Mexican Caesar, I could review more of the menu.  But, I can't.  It's just too good! Quick service, tasty salads, and plenty of toppings to choose from.  Avoid the lunch rush if possible."}
{"text":"After my doctor appt. I was starving but got lost. Bump into this place by accident. I don't crave for salads often but when I do. I gotta have it. It's during lunch hours so it's busy and the line is long. But they have this seamlessly under control. I was a bit overwhelmed. So a hostess Melissa was very kind to show me what to do. I wanted the classic Cobb but dislike Dijon but she said I can substitute it out. I opted for Ranch dressing without blu cheese! Salad is huge. I can get 2 full servings. The chicken is ok. Close to bland. I'll try a different type next time. But all in all it's a solid spot!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! A few adjectives, Slow, Rude, Out of stock, no manager, all employees with attitudes, poor dining experience. Let me start out by saying, I have eaten here a number of times, I like their salad, BUT tonight when I arrived at 8:45 there were 2 people in line, I waited at least 15 minutes to have the privilege to TRY to order, the place was out of some of their lettuce (imagine a salad place out of some of their lettuce) out of tomatoes, out of heart of palm and from the looks of it out of most toppings. There were 2 employees working the salad line and one guy running around picking up the table in a effort to close and get the heck out of there AND  IT SHOWED!!! There was no manager in sight! They were VERY UNDERSTAFFED and the 2 employees were rude and Slow (if I have not made that clear). We ordered 2 salads, there were very sub par, very small (did not fill up the bowl) and for $23, I would expect quite a bit more. As I stated, I have been there before and will give them another chance, but if this had been my first visit, I would be beyond done with this place. You might want to check back and see if they fire the manager and get some decent staff and food product inventory or just go to one of the other 10-20 places within 5 minutes and get a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Incredible salad.   So delicious !    Very nice atmosphere.  Reminds me of Elaine Bennus from Senfield \" Big Salad\".   They chop up the salad into bite size morsels to eat, you don 't need a knife and mix it all up with the salad dressing.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is so highly rated. We got take-out from here and were unimpressed. They got our order wrong (which we didn't discover until we'd already gotten home), and everything tasted stale. Especially the chicken. Distinctly reminiscent of a fast food salad. And a fruit fly buzzed out of one of the containers when I opened it. Not worth the price tag. Not even worth it if it were cheaper. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Nope. If you are going to base your brand on the \"chopped salad\" concept, you need to chop up the greens better. Also, the to-go containers here are the worst. The bowl is deep but packed to the brim, so it is nearly impossible to mix it yourself without getting salad all over the place.  To be fair, they are swarmed with a ridiculous number of orders during lunch hour, which might be why the salads are not as well-chopped as they should be. But with prices like these, I prefer to take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was a good place. It had too many choices that it was overwhelming. The salad was good though. I chose romaine, craisins, croutons, cucumber, chicken, corn, and ranch.  I gave it 4 stars because we found something that was not edible in our salad.  The manager was friendly and showed us around so that was also why I gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Making my own salad is like cooking for one:  it is better when someone else does it for you.   Hence, my attraction to Chopt.  Some have bristled at the lines, the menu, it's a chain, yadda, yadda, yadda.  All I know is they have plenty of options, friendly staff, efficient service, and a huge 8 cups full of goodness for around $10.  Plus, I can walk there easily from my home.  I usually get my salad to go; therefore, I always order the dressing on the side so the lettuce stays crisp and fresh until I eat.  There's so much food my wife and I split it between us!   Couple it with a chilled bottle of prosecco or sauvignon blanc and it's a casual evening by the pool...and they did all the work!  Call me a fan.  PS:  For those Myfitnesspal.com junkies, a lot their salads are posted for easy addition to your diary."}
{"text":"Great salads, and friendly staff. They are very efficient and work quickly to get your order done. Over all a fun experience, avoid the lunch rush between 12-2 it can be a bit chaotic!"}
{"text":"Really liked my salad and the whole concept. Fresh, organic ingredients and a filler. Wish there was a Chopt where I live."}
{"text":"Really good salads.  Both times each salad has been enough for two meals!   Wish they had more organic stuff though."}
{"text":"Tried this place today for the first time. It was so yummy! I told the staff it was my first time here and they were very helpful and made suggestions. I ordered the Mexican Tinga with the Mexican Goddess dressing. It was amazing! The Mexican Goddess has a little kick (spice) to it so if you don't like a lot of spice don't put a lot of dressing. Overall this place is great! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great salad! You can always customize the ones on the menu and take out whatever you don't like and add what you like for free (if they're equal on the menu). Service is amazing - from asking you if your salad is chopped enough to letting you try any dressing that intrigues you. They have the best crusty bread, and if you need extra it's free! The salads are very filling so I think the prices are fair. Pro tip: get it split in two with dressing on the side and you have two smaller meals. They have a great rewards program if you go a lot you get $10 after every $100, so basically one after every 10 salads. Last but not least, they're environmentally friendly and provide recycling for plastics used and added regular bowls for dining in. Love chopt!"}
{"text":"Sometimes all I want is a big delicious salad, and this covered it!  I ordered the cobb salad and everything was fresh, mixed perfectly, and tasted great!   Glad this place opened up!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing!! I am the pickiest eater when it comes to fresh produce. Any sign of wilt, I'm out! So when I came here and had the crispiest lettuce with the freshest toppings... I was in heaven!!!  The salad is huge! I've been twice now and neither time have I been able to finish it!  The layout of the store was a bit overwhelming when you walk in as there was no clear direction as to what we should do or where we should go but we just took it slow and merged in with everyone else. The staff was very friendly even tho it was hard to hear them at times. The process between when you order and when you pay is very quick!  This is definitely a new favorite spot :)"}
{"text":"so good! I have had the Mexican caesar, cobb and Chicken Tinga.  The chicken tinga is by far my favorite.  The marinated chicken is so good.  I typically get it with the california goddess dressing as I find the mexican goddess to be too spicy.  If you're not sure about a dressing you can always ask to try it before you commit. The service is fast and I love that they chop my salad up."}
{"text":"Bumped into this place by coincidence, but I did not regret my decision to try out their salads. They offer a broad array of salads and a couple of soups. All the available salads looked and sounded equally delicious. After sampling the soup I decided to go for the Mexican Chicken Soup paired with the Mediterranean Falafel salad with the Sriracha Tzatziki dressing. Both where very flavorful and the sriracha tzatziki dressing matched perfectly with the flavors of the salad. I enjoyed every bite and regret the fact that Chop't isn't available in Orange County, CA. The staff is very friendly and willing and able to answer all my questions."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I was excited to see this place pop up near my work. I quickly downloaded the app which makes it easy to order at work (you can even earn points). I finally had the opportunity to try them out and ordered some takeout. My salad didn't have avocado (an item valued at $1.99). I called and spoke to a very friendly and understanding employee who offered to remake the salad for me. I explained that traveling back to the store was not conducive to my plans that evening so she took my information and offered me a free salad upon my next visit. That was very kind of her and I was quite impressed with her ability to provide legendary service by exceeding my expectations.   Minutes later, I received a call from the manager. To my surprise she informed me that despite the lack of avocado in my salad she would be doing nothing. I would not be getting the agreed upon free salad. In my opinion, the manager handled the situation very unprofessionally and I have no interest in returning."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but the service is horrible.... They need to hire a new staff that is actually knowledgeable about the menu and friendly."}
{"text":"Yes, it's good. Yes it can be pricey. You are going to pay at least $10 for a salad and $12 if you want a pretty small amount of steak or anyone of the \"pay extra\" ingredients. Online menu lists stuff that they do not serve at this location such as shrimp which I really wanted. The menu is overwhelming and the place is loud. It was a good salad, especially the feta cheese, and it was big, but I don't think the price justified it, especially for the small amount of steak. Ice teas and lemonades were good (no soda here)."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the salad is great, when it is made right. We order salads to go all the time from this location and about 75% of the time its wrong.   Case and point today. 3 salads all ordered with Mexican Goddess dressing mixed in.   1 had some dressing (not sure which, definitely not mexican goddess) mixed in, 1 had no dressing mixed in with some vinaigrette on the side and finally the third had no dressing at all.   If they could just read a simple online order, this place could be a lot better."}
{"text":"I work at a bowling alley near CHOPT and I've been buying the smoky santa cruz for at least a year straight now lol. It's classic, light, and very filling. Kale, corn, black beans, grilled chicken, quinoa, cabbage with a little Mexican goddess and smoky vinaigrette. Also the vegan options are amazing as well. One of my top 5 places in Charlotte to have an actual healthy affordable meal."}
{"text":"Very different, but good.  You line up after you have read all the menu options posted above the kitchen.  Lots of variety, but you really need know what you want when you hit the cashier.  The salads are very generous.  You get alot.  They put your components together and mix them before loading they in deep plastic containers.  You sit where there is room or take you salads to-go.  Simple operation and they move fast.  Can be expensive if you really lard up on ingredients.  Pay attention.  Their basic salads do not need much more to make them better.  Drinks are at a separate bar/area and you set up what you like.  Good for kids if they are into veggies and salads.  Tell them that it is rabbit food.  Reminds me of places in California:  fresh ingredients, custom blending, many options, fast service and do-it-yourself.  Eat and go or go and eat.  Simple and it works."}
{"text":"Great place for a salad. They offer meat or meat substitutes as well as some sort of warm grain bowls. Pretty much something for everyone. Their salads are enormous  and they have a nice variety of unsweetened tea which is great. The only bad thing is they stay pretty busy so there's usually not enough time to run over on your 30 min lunch break. The salads are  expensive too, roughly $10 for a salad."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom, had a wonderful lunch! I had the Mexican Caesar and she had the Santa Fe.  They chop everything up really tiny and it is delicious. Very healthy place...no soft drinks!  I can't wait to come back and try more.  The pics I took are not good bc it just looks like chopped greens but it was delicious! They had a nice tall lady walking around asking people in line if they had questions, etc.  definitely will put this place in my regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Cleanliness went out to door here. Disappointed in a place I once enjoyed. Service also lacking. Hope things improve or will go to its other locations."}
{"text":"I like Chopt. I really like this location. I like how you can order ahead on the app and have your food ready to pick up when you get there. I like how spacious and modern the dining area is. I even like the people who work here because they are just so dang friendly.  There isn't much to not like here. I guess some might argue that salads shouldn't cost $10, but I'd argue back that the value is in the selection, quality, and freshness. I've never had any wilted greens, spoiled spinach, or really any bad toppings to speak of. Everything gets chopped here, and the guy/gal doing your chopping will add however much dressing you'd like, along with salt & pepper.  On a busy day during lunch time, you're going to be standing in line for awhile. Take my advice and use the mobile app.  I'm not always in the mood for a salad. But as far as getting a filling meal under 500 calories without feeling overburdened by your lunch choice, Chopt is the way to go."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. There's an assembly spot, then the chopper, then cashier. The assembly process was a little crowded and it was hard to hear. The chopper was friendly and great. The cashier was also great. So far the first visit wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I'm a health nut when it comes to food (90% of the time) and Chopt may be in my top 3 all-time favorite healthy food stops. I have had the Palm Beach & Santa Fe Salads, along with a variety of their Destination Salads which change every 60 days. The menu also includes salad sandwiches, soups and grain/noodle bowls to please the whole crowd. Some restaurants charge you $10 for a pitiful salad, but you definitely get your money's worth at Chopt with great serving sizes and fresh, healthy ingredients."}
{"text":"One of the best salad place for me. I've been trying so many different salads and I never disappointed. Very fresh, big dishes, very testy."}
{"text":"Decided to try this fairly new restaurant for the first time for an early Saturday lunch, and early is important because it fills up fast. Now I see why. It's not your average salad joint.   It does about a dozen or or so specialty salads and you can also create your own. Salads are constructed on assembly line basis in a very efficient and mildly entertaining system. All ingredients appear to be very freshly prepared and the entire restaurant, especially the food prep area, is shiny and immaculate. The dining area is expansive inside and out, in fact it's one of my favorites anywhere in the area.  We tried the MEXICALI VEGAN consisting of  avocado, hearts of palm, grape tomatoes, black beans, tortilla chips, jalapeño peppers, romaine & spinach and the MEDITERRANEAN FALAFEL made with chickpea falafel, Mama Lil's spicy peppers, celery, quinoa cauliflower \"rice\", kale & brocollini. Both were special and filling. Can't wait to try another one, which I will soon because this place is definitely a Gotta Try."}
{"text":"My first time visiting Chopt was a little overwhelming. It seems to be pretty trendy, so I gave it a shot. I didn't want to hold up the line so I quickly ordered the Mexican Caesar salad. I don't know if it was just me, maybe the music was too loud or the employees were speaking too low- I couldnt hear a thing any of them were saying. I just kind of \"agreed\" to whatever. Now I realize they were asking how I wanted my salad chopping and offering the piece of bread. I felt pretty awkward.  Anyways, kinda pricey but to be expected. Salad was really good though."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Stopped in for lunch for a salad, everything tasted fresh & super yummy.  Service was phenomenal also. :)"}
{"text":"I ate at this place a couple weeks ago because a friend of mine is vegan and so this is where we ended up. And today I went back because honestly, I just wanted to taste that damn salad again. Unfortunately I couldn't remember what the hell I ordered. But I got the Palm Beach. Great salad. It's so fresh and filling. I don't feel cheated. Staff was helpful and It didn't take long at all. I'ma make this place a regular of mine. Eat clean."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would for tonight's visit. We go to this location atleast 1-2 times per week. I must caution anyone planning to eat here after 7:30 pm to lower your expectations. We stopped by tonight, and ordered our salads as normal. When we walked down to add toppings, we were told they were out of Avocado, carrots,  quinoa, cranberries. We ordered 2 chicken Tinga's and 2 kids craft salads. We were understanding of not having some toppings, but after they started chopping and asked what dressing we wanted, there was no California goddess dressing. We opted for caeser instead because that was the only non-spicy dressing that they had. There were maybe 2 very very very short squirts of dressing (#very dry salad). She also loaded my chicken tinga with 3 spoonfuls of chicken (more than likely to compensate for not having quinoa which she didn't tell me until the very end. This was THE chewiest dry dry driest salad I've ever had. The workers seemed to be pretty annoyed with having to explain that they were out of each topping that even the customers behind and in front of us asked for. My husband overheard the girl chopping our salads mentioning that they had carrots and cranberries in the back, but it wasn't \"prepped\". How can you have over an hour and a half til close and not offer your customers something that you simply \"have in the back\" but \"don't feel like prepping\". We spent $40.00 on subpar salads tonight. NEVER AGAIN will we eat there after 730 again."}
{"text":"Chicken Tinga! I never feel guilty after eating this salad. It satisfies my appetite as well as my diet. Always clean, always nice service. So glad to have this option in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Every time i walk in, i think we've made a huge mistake and should turn around based on the line that appears like it could take days (it doesn't). The organized chaos of the line ensues and we walk away with delicious salads after only a brief few moments of people-induced anxiety.  They typically have someone walking around to help those with the scared look in their eye.   I do tend to leave here wanting more which can be interpreted as it was so good i want more or i was still a little hungry from the portion. A mix of both probably.   I downloaded the app and got $3 off my second trip in which was nice."}
{"text":"This location has lost all sense of customer service/satisfaction. Consistency is apparently not a thing here anymore. When you order a salad that you've had multiple, multiple times you expect what you always get. Consistency is key to any successful restaurant. I don't want chicken that taste like a wet dog anywhere near, nor on my salad for that matter.  Cashier was very dismissive and acted like she couldn't care less and shrugged her shoulders as she handed me my second salad, that was still incorrect. Won't be going back to this location. Who lets the cashier deal with a customer issue? If that's the case, at least be kind and understanding. Don't act like your paying customer, who use to be a regular, is inconveniencing you. After all, I had to drive up there twice tonight for both times to be messed up. What a disappointment and let down dinner was tonight. Never got a single sorry. CUSTOMER SERVICE... learn it."}
{"text":"We've been here too many times to count! My husband is a bit obsessed and chopt is a good option for a quick, healthy meal if you need to get something out. We typically take our salads to go and enjoy them at home. My husband usually gets the Mexican Caesar with Mexican goddess dressing and I like to make my own, usually with the spicy red peppers, cooked onions, beets and falafel. I prefer the falafel chopped up with the salad rather than left whole. I too usually go for Mexican Ceasar, it's creamy, spicy and vegan, or the Dijon. I also love to try to specials that are inspired by different international locations. I choose well so I never feel bad about eating chopt. The small slice of fresh bread is also a nice addition.   If you go regularly make sure to download the app for discounts!"}
{"text":"The salad  was amazing. I am not even a salad person and I was extremely impressed.. If you want a salad try this place out.. They also have nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Thank you once again my yelp people! Found this as one of three alternative light eateries recommended and it did not disappoint. Sharon had the Baja shrimp bowl while had the southwest beef bowl with a side of Mexican chicken. (All pictured below although all half eaten, lol) while we sadly do not have one of these gems where I am there is a location in Wilmington, NC which is a place sharon and I both like to go anyway so winner, winner! There are locations in the north east so if you happen to live near one and feel like eating light but with flavor be sure to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Okay I LOVE Chopt!  I go here every week and have enjoyed the salads there thoroughly!  But here is the problem and the reason why I gave 3 stars.....I ordered a salad for myself and my son...I stepped over to the chopper and forgot that my son wanted his in a wrap.  I told the chopper and he told me he could only use half the salad for a wrap.  Wait a minute here...you mean to tell me Chopt is charging the same price for a wrap as they charge for a salad bowl yet they only put half the salad in the wrap???   The chopper did offer to put the other half of the salad in a bowl for me.  But I got to thinking all those times I've ordered wraps and have been charged for a full price salad when I only got half a salad?? That seems very wrong to me!!!   So from now on I will order the salad and ask the chopper to put half in a wrap and the other half in a bowl.  I just want what I paid for and the fact that they charge for a full price when you actually get half seems like a rip off to me!"}
{"text":"My first trip to Chopt was stellar, not just because my salad was delicious, but mainly because of the service and experience.   The restaurant was clean and the servers were smiley. The set up was easy and convenient. Just go through the line to either order one of their specialty salads or you can build your own by selecting from an array of fresh toppings - veggies, fruits, meats. All the toppings looked fresh and fantastic.  Since I was a first timer, I was unfamiliar with the process and didn't know what to expect. I chose to create my own salad. Whenever I eat a salad at a restaurant, I typically get the salad dressing on the side. However, since the server was mixing the dressing in with the salad, rolled with it so I could get the full experience. So the server started pouring the dressing and asked me to tell him when to stop. When I told him him to stop, he started mixing the salad and it looked a little dry to me so I told him to add a little more salad dressing.  I sat down and started eating my salad and low and behold, it ended up being too much dressing! Please note: this was all my fault! I told the server to add more dressing and he simply did as he was told.   Since this was my mistake, I attempted to continue eating the salad but the dressing was just overwhelming.  Suddenly this sweet man walks up to ask me if I was enjoying my meal. Turns out it was the manager ~ Cole. I told him how good everything was but that I added too much dressing. Cole quickly told me that he wanted me to have a great first experience at Chopt so without hesitation he offered to get me another salad for free. But he didn't stop there. He walked with me through the line, talked me through the process, pointed out some additional vegetables to try, and made sure I got the perfect amount of dressing. My new salad was just right.  This experience might not sound like a big deal to some but to me it was everything! I mean what customer doesn't like to feel valued and special and that's exactly how Cole made me feel.   Please go check out Chopt. You'll love the food and the service! I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite place to grab a salad.  I have to admit I haven't been here in about 6 weeks and I am completely disappointed.  They have become very stingy with the toppings (what am I paying $12 for?)and what happened to the lemonade?  All they have now is unsweetened flavored water that has virtually no flavor.  To top it all off they were out of bread at 6:20 on a Friday night.  They have lost my business."}
{"text":"I've been hesitant to try Chopt because (a) it is still pretty new (b) I eat like a caveman and love meat and (c) it always looks busier than a popsicle shop in Hell. I finally got the nerve up to head in and was pleasantly surprised. There was definitely a long line, but Chopt essentially has an assembly line set up minimize prep time. There was a great selection of salads on the menu and also a \"create your own\" option. The pre-set selections covered pretty much every combination under the sun with kale, lettuce, spinach, mixes, toppings from hear to yon, and dressings coming out of your ears. Almost overwhelming, but in a good way.  I settled on the Santa Fe (no meat!) because I like to sweat a little bit when I eat, and it was listed as a \"First Time Favorite\". I can back up that claim. I love a good romaine crunch in my salads, there was a healthy helping of my favorite food (pepperjack cheese), and the corn, avocado, tomatoes, and fried onions were an awesome combo. The sweet & smokey chipotle vinaigrette was just that, and definitely met the sweat quotient I require in a meal.   Prep time was very quick and also awesome to watch. They offer regular soda options as well as some drinks from their cooler such as sparkling water."}
{"text":"I love Chopt Salads! At first I was a little intimidated because it is always a long line especially on the weekends and the menu you has a lot of options that made it hard for me to decide what salad to order and then what salad dressing I wanted to add to my salad.   My go to salad is the California Steakhouse. OMG its amazing and I cant seem to order anything else yet. I added fried onions to the salad to give it a little crunch. You really cant beat that huge salad that only has 230 calories!! The ingredients are always fresh and the employees always chop my salad to perfection. I can never finish a whole salad so it might be perfect for people to possibly share.  The teas are really good and so many great flavors. I did not realize there was Agave available to sweeten your tea but my tea was still good unsweetened. There is not soft drinks available here.  I love Chopts unique concept and their amazing menu."}
{"text":"Love Chopt for a quick lunch/dinner!   Typically great service and quality but the last 2 visits could have been better- skimping on lettuce to avoid refilling the salad bar- visibly looking for a new container of lettuce and then just moving on when it couldn't be found. Came across as lazy. That being said, still a solid 4 as I love my Palm Beach salad here so much that 2/20 isn't really too bad."}
{"text":"Chopt is among the better fast casual salad options I've tried. The menu is large with 10-12 salads to choose from, three seasonal salads and a build your own option. I had the Cobb and subbed the Dijon dressing for the chipotle vinaigrette. The ingredients were fresh and perfectly \"Chopt\" by an employee using a Mezzanine knife. Salads can be served in a bowl or in a large plastic to-go container that includes a lid. Salads are also offered a piece of bread to accompany your meal. I really enjoyed the bread as it was soft with a great crispy crust. The dining room looks a bit small, but there is a second room toward the back of the restaurant with plenty of seating for small and large groups. It's easy to understand why Chopt is a fan favorite in Charlotte and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, healthy meal packed with flavor."}
{"text":"First time here , it's real busy a lot of noise and confusion but I had the green market grain bowl and it was awesome , I was also impressed with the tea and drinks selection   I felt rushed in line mostly because it's new and I didn't know the options  , overall great  i will be back"}
{"text":"I love a good salad. The older I get and healthier I become, the more I crave them. Well Chopt gives you the rush you need with a little creativity on the side. This is my second time indulging in this salad wizardry and I'm still impressed. Lets be honest...it is a lot to choose from and if you're a newbie you find yourself reading the same thing over and over. But hey at least they let you sample the chicken. It is a little pricey for a salad but what isn't these days especially when it's good and fulfilling AND there's enough for leftovers. The staff is very patient and explains what you may not understand. The location is always busy and they may want to add more wait staff but I'll patronize again when I have 15$ extra bucks laying around."}
{"text":"Have been to Chopt before, when I was a less seasoned leafy green eater. As a changed man, my opinion similarly followed suit. They have a great concept of providing creative salads that have breadth beyond adding fancy dressings. There aren't enough fast casual restaurants like this in charlotte, so I am glad that they are opening a new location. Join the rewards program, you get $10 for every $100 you spend. If you are thinking \"how could I possibly spend $100 there?\", then you need to try it once before you understand how easy it is."}
{"text":"Just got my first Chopt salad and while I agree with all of the positive feedback from other reviewers, I did notice a couple of kinks/quirks I'd like to see worked out.   1) I had to call four different numbers to reach the store. That's right - 4. The only place that has the correct phone number for this location is the Chopt website.   2) I ordered the Olympia salad - when my \"chopper\" opted not to chop it, I brought up the point and he told me that salads with grain aren't chopped. Well that seems like an easy fix... Chop the salad then toss in the grains. Maybe I'll suggest next time.   3) I ordered and paid for an Olympia salad with Greek chicken on it. Definitely no chicken in the salad I brought home.   None of this takes away from the fact that I had a great experience and a delicious salad and I will be going back. Just hope that I don't experience any of the above as I'm hoping to put Chopt in my regular lunch/dinner rotation."}
{"text":"I love this place!I enjoy the variety of options and the freshness of the vegetables.It can get crowded here so make sure you pay attention to the peak hours.I really wish they would open one in NE CLT.I'm unable to frequent this as much as I'd like because the location is not convenient for me."}
{"text":"Bring back the old containers!! I know this may sound silly to some but I loved how I used to be able to get 2 meals out of it. If I'm paying $10-$12 for a salad and now getting less the price should reflect that. I asked the people at Chopt why they changed and they said people complained about the lettuce to topping ratio.... Not cool, Chopt! That was what I loved about this spot! The salads itself are fresh and high quality ingredients but I feel like now I'm getting half of what I used to get for the same price."}
{"text":"The service is fast, the menu is creative and on top of that they have a great variety of hot sauces to choose from. Might I add, this is the only place (that I know of) where I can get a large kale salad...Cant get a better salad than this.....GO."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! I should preface that I used to love in the DC area and was already a fan of Chopt. I was stoked to learn that they were building a location in Charlotte! It doesn't matter which option you select, all of their salads are fresh and delicious! It's in the Park Road Shopping Center which is a great place to relax and people watch from the outdoor seating! Give it a try! I will warn you that it gets crazy busy at lunch time during the week but you always have the option to call our order in and then pick it up (which is what I usually do)."}
{"text":"I think I have found my new favorite food spot! This place has fresh and healthy choices for food that will fill you up.  I got the Olympia grain salad that contained local feta cheese, chick peas, quinoa, lentil and Millet blend, kale, spinach and purple cabbage. I also added grilled chicken, which is optional.  I could barely finish this salad.  The restaurant was clean, service was fast and the staff was courteous.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Salads are huge! Great price for what you get. Didnt give 5 stars because it takes so long to get  Would come more often but lines are rediculous long and takes like 30 min to get your food, but everything else is great!!!!!"}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here today based on the buzz - good experience overall.  Ordering is a bit chaotic - a lot of South Park moms and strollers and business people streaming in and out and waiting in line. However, the \"Quick Casual\" line goes fast and the multiple servers behind the windows help. Great pre-defined options as well as a-la-cart. I had the NY street salad and it was great - lots of rich flavors, great combo of chicken sharma and sun-dried tomatoes, and the hot sauce adds a great touch. Seating is tough during lunch, and I saw a bunch of people getting take-out.  Overall I'll be back but probably to get it to go!"}
{"text":"My sister and I were having a pretty busy morning, and we were getting hungry. She is a bit of a health nut, so she suggested this restaurant! It was beautifully set up, and very bright and welcoming.  It was noon when we decided to eat, so it was rather busy. The menu has some great options, but I ended up making my own salad (to-go). They have tons of toppings/extras you can add to your salad!! I got romaine lettuce, jalapenos, egg whites, edamame, feta cheese, tomatoes, and grilled chicken. The lady that was helping me, pointed me toward the gentleman that was going to be chopping my salad (there were three of them total). He was very welcoming, and asked what dressing I would like. He chopped for a couple minutes then asked if it was chopped to my liking, I actually wanted it chopped more and he was happy to do so! My sister has been to Chopt plenty of times, and advised me to get the dressing on the side because I will not finish my salad. When I went to check out, they offered me complementary bread, WHAT?  It was a beautiful afternoon, and they had tables outside so we just grabbed one. The balsamic vinaigrette was amazing! It is definitely thick, but that is actually how I prefer it! Everything was so fresh! And it was enough for two meals!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Go for the Destination Salad choices - they are on the menus only for a couple months and often offer the most unique approaches and flavor profiles to salad making that set Chopt apart. I love that they post calorie counts for everything, making it easier to make the choice to be smart or indulgent. Don't overlook their soups, which also change seasonally and so far have all been excellent. The one annoying thing is they always ask how much dressing I want as they apply it and all I really want is what the \"normal\" amount is for the calorie count displayed. Sometimes the pressure of so many choices (\"is this chopped enough?\", \"how much dressing?\", \"do you want any different ingredients than what is listed for your choice?\") becomes overwhelming.  I think the flexibility to ask for it differently is great but the pressure they place on the fast moving line is a turn off."}
{"text":"I love how this place offers tons of healthy options especially for vegans and vegetarian. On the downside though the menu is pretty extensive so it's a good idea to check out the menu before you go inside because it's healthy \"fast\" food. On a positive note the staff is very friendly and helpful. My salad was pretty good"}
{"text":"As an already established fan of Chop't - I've had it on trips to other cities - I knew what to expect. However, I do have to say I really liked the layout of this particular location. Maybe this has something to do with its still shiny, new veneer, but the ENTIRE staff was so friendly and upbeat.  I went in after the lunch rush (around 2:15ish) and there was a manager walking around and directing patrons to menus and answering questions. Before I went in, I had taken some time to look at the menu online so I knew what I wanted. I ordered the santa fe salad with the chipotle vinaigrette dressing on the side. The chipotle vinaigrette has a spicy kick, like VERY spicy.   If you are a Chop't newbie, I highly suggest looking at the menu online to get a feel of what they already offer and it'll give you a chance to look over the ingredients in case you want to come up with your own salad creation. The salads are HUGE and I'm able to get two separate meals out of them. With the size, there comes a price. My santa fe salad (with the addition of grilled chicken) came to just under $10. I don't really consider that price too bad considering Zaxby's charges $8 for a salad that's 1/3 of the size.  If salads are your thing, definitely do not pass up the chance to enjoy what other cities have known for a long time now: Chop't is delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place and come every chance I get. As someone who is a big fan of salads I have trouble finding good, interesting salads outside of Crisp in the Elizabeth area. Happy to have Chopt in the area. They should put one in Plaza Midwood with all of that new construction!"}
{"text":"So long, Crisp! My heart belongs to Chopt. My coworkers and I went super early for lunch on a Friday at 11:20 a.m. to make sure we got a seat, which was a smart move because it was packed when we left.  Thanks to the Yelp reviews, I had an idea of what to expect, but it's still a little intimidating. However, there was an incredibly nice, helpful Chopt employee working the line to answer questions and make suggestions. Even the salad putter-togetherers and choppers were helpful, funny, and friendly!  I had checked out the menu ahead of time so that I wouldn't be as overwhelmed, and I went with the Harvest Cobb - spinach, beets, apples, cranberries, goat cheese, and chicken (hold the romaine) with white balsamic vinaigrette. Yuuuummmmmm. It was delicious and HUGE. We all had enough leftover to get to-go boxes, and I'm so excited that I get to eat it again."}
{"text":"This is tale of two ratings: the food and the service  The food was pretty good. I was happy with my salad and I found it filling. I thought they were missing some obvious salad options, like pan seared tuna, but mine was tasty. They did mess up my sisters order, forgetting the chicken which was on the bill.   The service was horrid. I can't remember another place where I felt that everyone I encountered deserved to be fired. This included the manager, who approached me when I was about to leave, but then assuming I was going to complain, turned and ran to the back. The turning and running was a common theme; I was waiting for one of the cashiers, who turned to me and asked if she could help, but then left leaving me to talk to thin air. The other cashier was no better. He seemed to be playing a game where he would not answer any questions I asked. Soon I stopped talking, which was the easiest way to avoid frustration. It was odd behavior for human beings; even odder for people in service roles.   My bro in law mentioned a similar experience when he was there several months ago; sadly, it has not improved. So as good as the salads tasted, until there are massive changes, I will not go back"}
{"text":"I got the chopt mix with chipotle chicken, avocado and sweet and smoky chipotle dressing: it was delicious, but this a bit pricey for salad. I got the slingshot cold brew, it wasn't that great. The place has clean and modern decor, quite cute."}
{"text":"i love chopt. i eat it once a week. i almost ALWAYS use the app to avoid lines. if i have an issue, i address it as feedback in the app and they always handle it well! the ingredients and always fresh& i can't live without the mexican goddess dressing. and a word to the chopt gods: a vegan caesar dressing would make my whole life!"}
{"text":"Chopt is my new favorite neighborhood spot! The ingredients are abundant, healthy and fresh. I love the uniqueness of the experience- you have someone who prepares your salad (puts all the ingredients in your bowl), then they bring you down to your \"chopper\" who dumps out the ingredients, chops everything up, and if desired, mixes your dressing in evenly. Their go-to line you'll hear at every visit is: \"Is this chopped enough for you?\", kind of like Chick-fil-A people always saying \"my pleasure\" instead of \"you're welcome\". One thing I love is that all the ingredients are pretty measured, so my salad always tastes the same, which is fantastic. My personal favorite is the steakhouse salad (which I sometimes add bacon to). One major tip I have is that once you've had \"the experience\" in-store, don't be afraid to call it in on your next visits! The line gets incredibly long and can take 20+ minutes just to get up to the counter. Generally call-in orders are ready in 15. I've never had an issue with my call-in orders being any less tasty than in-store ordering."}
{"text":"Love this place, best do it yourself salad around and it's 2 blocks from my house. The variety of topping, greens and dressings is incredible and you can try something different every time. Don't forget to get some of that raspberry lemonade!"}
{"text":"The salads and dressing are great. Very flavorful and put together nicely. The price is over expensive but you pay for quality."}
{"text":"I love this place, I come here about 2 to 3 times a week for lunch! It is a little pricey but I keep coming back soo..."}
{"text":"The Chopt hype is real. Fresh ingredients, fun concept and AMAZINGLY friendly staff. This is a great addition to the fast casual lunch scene in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been to Chopt a handful of times given that it is the best salad fast casual in CLT.  Location/Atmosphere: Located at Park Road Shopping Center - there is plenty of parking! This location looks like it's small (maybe about 10-12 tables in the front), but there are tables in the back that a lot of people don't seem to realize.   Food/Drink: The salads here are very fresh. Last time I ordered I got the Smoky Santa Cruz which consists of: Avocado, Corn, Scallions, Tri-Color Quinoa, Black Beans, Kale, Broccoleaf, and Purple Cabbage with the sweet and smoky chipotle vin and a drizzle of mexican goddess. I don't love scallions, so I swapped them out with rainbow carrots. It was so good! I like to get the dressing on the side - so I felt like I had a really healthy salad. I highly recommend ordering the pre-designed salads. They carry Lenny Boy kombuchas ... which I love -- so big ups for that!  Service: The last time I was in there eating a woman came up to the table to ensure we were having a good experience and cleared our table. She was very sweet. The man who made my salad was very kind too. The girls at the register were a little sassy, but I may have been too after the Saturday they were having (spent 30 minutes waiting in line!)  Price: I recommend ordering the pre-designed salads, you can make swap outs on them and they end up costing much less than if you make your own salad. The last time I was there I ordered a Smoky Santa Cruz and it was about $9.  Notes: I couldn't get over the time at 2PM on a Saturday. It was crazy. I'd suggest 2:30PM or 3PM to avoid the lunch crew. Or order ahead!"}
{"text":"I went from pissed off that some hack wrote an article bashing Crisp while glorifying this place, to coming here almost once a week. Don't get me wrong, I still love and eat at Crisp just as much as I do here but I do see the hype. My favorite is easily the Kabob Cobb with Chicken and a little bit of both offered dressings. I want to branch out but I have literal cravings for this one. Charlotte is big enough for two great salad places and with the amount of bad food I put in my body, I am glad there is now another delicious healthy option."}
{"text":"Great place! Staff are very nice and funny! The salads are also great and very tasty. The positions are big so you will definitely get full with just salad! I buy a salad and I usually portion it for 3 or 4 days."}
{"text":"YES. Fresh, healthy, and delicious. It's nice to have a really great fast-casual restaurant in Park Road Shopping center."}
{"text":"I haven't had a salad until now. This place is amazing, and it serves my vegan diet. The options were very nice, the salad is bursting with flavor.   The customer service is great! All the employees were so friendly and patient, and it was their busy time. They made sure I would like the salad I was ordering."}
{"text":"Food is good but chopping process takes way  to long.  I visited this place twice and both times had the same chopper.  She was extremely slow and unfriendly.  My husband ordered after me in line and had his salad chopped by a different chopper, paid and was eating for about 5 minutes before the girl got to chopping mine. Overall if your looking for a quick bite this might not be the place."}
{"text":"My first time ever visiting a Chopt was to this location. It just opened, and it is a nice addition to the many restaurants in the Arboretum.  The first thing I noticed about this restaurant is how spacious it is. They did not try to fit a ton of tables in a tiny space. There are spacious booths, and a ton of tables.  There are also a few outside tables.  Plenty of space for everyone.  I went on one of the grand opening days and the staff was really hustling.  My salad was excellent, and my son enjoyed his kid meal.  There's definitely a ton of options and there's also a rotating seasonal menu. I would definitely like to come back."}
{"text":"Chopt is a favorite of mine when I come home to visit. I always request to come here with my mom and sister upon touchdown in Charlotte. Fresh ingredients, fast and friendly service, and delicious food. I love tha variety of choices you have to create a salad that curbs your craving no matter what your in the mood for. Chopt is exceptional even compared to the many salad bar options we have in LA. Love, love, love it here and will probably make a second stop in later this week!"}
{"text":"Customer service at this location is horrendous! I love Chopt, and go to the other locations frequently."}
{"text":"I would've given this location a two a few months ago because every time I went it was always something (no dressing, no chicken, no cucumbers etc) once they even charged me for a Cesar salad full price with no dressing . (I ordered online using their app) Craziness . But I gave it a go again the other night. I was very hesitant because it was close to closing time. But I was extremely hungry and coming from the gym. To my surprise everything was fresh and available. The manager lady (young black female, didn't catch her name) was inviting when I walked in (I came in like 10min before closing time) and the staff didn't seem too annoyed by my entrance. The salad it's self was delicious and fresh. I'm happy to see the improvements. Hopefully it stays this way!"}
{"text":"Just love this place. Don't know what you want on your salad, there are so many choices when you build your own. Tried the spicy think dressing this time, yum sums it up!"}
{"text":"I hate that I am writing this.  I've been coming to this Chopt since it opened several years ago as it is AMAZING!! I used to joke that I spent my paycheck every week on over priced salads, before I moved to Texas for a year and a half.  Now that I'm back in Charlotte of course I would return to Chopt! I've places two separate pick up orders and disappointed more each time.  The first I asked for the Tex mex ranch on my tinga salad mixed in and Chopt, as well as a extra side.   I prob should have checked but got home and the salad was NOT chopped and there was no dressing on the salad or otherwise on the side.  Today I tried a second time.  This time most the chicken mix was hard as a rock and inedible.  Perhaps it was the bottom of the pot I don't know.  Lesson learned that if I come back I will NOT call a take out order.   I find it frustrating that I've had two 12$ bowls that have been thrown away.   I hope this place can get back on track."}
{"text":"If you love Chopt and you don't have the app on your phone you're doing life wrong. I can order my salad in the morning and it's ready at whatever time I indicate. You can walk in and walk out it's so wonderful! My favorite is the Mexican Cesar! I love i add the quinoa parmesan crisps.   This place gets super busy during the day so definitely order on the app and find a good seat in the back of the store. It's usually pretty quiet there (i May have just given away a huge Chopt secret but it's worth it)!"}
{"text":"This does a good job with it's salads.  Variety of toppings are available to build your own or you can order favorites that has preset contents. Dressings are very tasty  as well."}
{"text":",We enjoy salads for lunch so we decided to try Chopt, a salad restaurant . The restaurant has a myriad of salads : you can create your own you, can order classic salads , grain salads , platter salads and sides of salads. There is a variety of dressings to chose from:: the goddess dressing group the nut and yogurt dressing group , the vinagrette group, Caesar group , creamy classics group and their pantry dressings and condiments such as vinegars  lemon, olive oil etc. Almost every salad ingredient you can imagine such as romaine, kale , arugula , spinach etc . tomatoes and, peppers, cucumbers, different  fresh and dried fruits , different veges ,  peas   beans , chips croutons,  etc plus grains such as quinoa, lentils, millet, falafel and  soba noodles . A variety of proteins  such as chicken , steak, bacon,  shrimp , tofu, nuts and  hard boiled eggs. Different beverages such as natural type of sodas, fruit drinks, are available as well as packaged cookies if somebody wants something sweet . Bread and soup are also available .Prices are moderate, could get expensive with added ingredients ,  portions are not skimpy. The restaurant is clean and bright , friendly, well staffed and busy when we arrived .  You stand at the counter and  pick out your salad selection or ingredient choices. The salad is chopped on a cutting board in front of you behind the counter  ,placed in the bowl, given to you and lastly you pay the cashier.  I ordered the Palm Beach salad with chicken plus a hard boiled egg . My choice was the basil mint dressing which I did not care for  so I requested a different  dressing which they readily  gave me. Initially the salad came with a hot honey vinagrette which I did not want .  I enjoyed my salad very much couldn't finish it ,so it was put in a take out container for me to bring home . I certainly would return again and try a different salad on the menu  Update: returned with my dining mate and enjoyed 2 different  delicious salads. I tried the Classic Cobb with a Green Goddess dressing  on the side and my dining mate the Nashville Hot chicken salad with a buttermilk Caesar dressing. Both large salads priced around $10. Certainly a full meal , with ones Vegetable and protein combos. We also tried the vegetarian vegetable soup, basic in flavor and full of assorted veges. I noticed a menu for kids salads and a  blackboard designating their use of local produce in the area. Definitively a great place to go to if you enjoy delicious salads . The staff are well organized, helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Chopt for the first time! I promise I don't live under a rock...  I did learn why it's called Chopt. If you've ever been here before you know why. After making your salad, they use this special tool to \"chop\" your salad more finely. Say goodbye to awkward salad eating (you know the big bites of lettuce etc you have to fit in your mouth, may or may not get some on your cheeks). Nope, not here! It's easy to eat, literally! Not to mention it tastes sooo good!   Lots of options to order, or build your own. All ingredients tasted so fresh and delicious. I had the chicken tinga which is one of their warm salads (has warm quinoa & chicken). I like that they asked if I wanted everything on there that normally comes with that salad. I said no peppers please. Then they ask which Ingredient instead! Score. So I choose a boiled egg. At no additional cost.   They do not offer sodas. Healthy here! They do have their own lemonades and teas which all sounded grand. I normally have water but splurged on a mint lemonade, and it was very refreshing!   Lunch time gets busy here! Place is nice inside. There's a bigger room at the end of the hall that's kind of hidden so if you go and it's packed. Have no fear, there's more places to sit! I enjoyed their interesting wall paper in this back room. It's surfers. But on vegetables instead of boards. Catchy!   Overall great:yummy experience. Just pricey for a salad so giving 4 stars. (Average $10 a salad I'd say)"}
{"text":"So delicious. I've never in my life felt full from eating a salad, but I could only eat half of the Classic Cobb before I had to pack up and take the rest home. The ordering process is a tiny bit confusing, but otherwise, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why I haven't reviewed this place yet, seeing that I've been here about 30 times since they opened.  I absolutely love make-your-own-salad anything.  The more I can customize it, the better I like it.  Chopt really takes salad to a new level.  They have a bunch of different types of lettuce, from romaine to kale, and feel free to mix/match two different kinds.  They also have a ton of toppings, from your standard cucumbers and tomatoes, to soba noodles and cotija cheese.  They also have a huge variety of dressings, so you can be as good or bad as you want on the calories.  There is one thing that stands out, and that's the destination salads.  If your'e one of those people that walks in and orders the same thing every time, I encourage you to try out one of their own creations.  They put some inventive combinations together so salad will never be boring to you again.  Tip from a pro.  If you pretty much know what you want, order your salad through the Chopt app!!!  Not only will you sip the ridiculous line that never seems to die down at any point in time during the day, but you can just pick up your salad and eat it there if you don't want it to go.  You can also earn Chopt points through the app!  The only downside is that you can't stand there and try different dressings/toppings.  You've gotta know what you want.  I absolutely love this place, so yes, I will be back again and again and again.  I probably wouldn't recommend this place if you're starving and need instant food gratification.  Save that for a drive-through.  If you want to just get a really good lunch or dinner made your way, Chopt is a great place to go."}
{"text":"I have had the worst experience at the establishment. I had long layover at CLT back to SFO and my sister suggested we eat here. Jamar is the shining star at this restaurant he works hard with a smile and apologized spontaneously for the shortcomings of his coworker.    Never assume because people of the same ethnicity are standing beside one another that they are together. I never pull the race card but this was blatant and nowhere near covert. The personnel can use more training in customer interaction. If you make a mistake one should acknowledge it apologize and attempt to correct the problem.   The product is okay but the personnel needs work."}
{"text":"Love the salad's, very fresh, great fresh dressings. Ordered catering for the office and the salad wraps were so disappointing. They should provide dressings on the side, especially since they use Kale and it can really overpower the wraps, making them very very bland."}
{"text":"I like the idea of grabbing a salad, all mixed up for me, to eat in a hurry. Better option than Chickfil. Cobb Salad was very good. I will be back to try more.  I love the location.  Favorite shopping center! Easy parking!  I went mid afternoon so it was not busy. Friendly staff to help.  But the best part!!  Is the ice tea/lemonade choices!! This rocks!! No soda. Yea!! I will come in just to get a drink to go. Just remember Chopt....keep it filled at all times."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly fresh and so good. Also try to be local. All organic, non gmo, free range, etc. Great service!"}
{"text":"I was craving a salad all day and I decided to try out Chopt and I did not go wrong with this choice!!! My salad was so yummy, I got it to-go and it didn't even make it back to the office!! I ordered the Palm Beach with shrimp minus the heart of palm but added corn with the Tex-Mex Ranch!! OMG...delicious! I believe this is now my favorite salad shop-stop in Charlotte!! My mother ordered the Santa Fe and she was not disappointed!   The employees were really attentive and very patient, all except one! I asked to taste test 2 different dressings and I could see I needed to hurry and make a decision! Yikes!! I apologized and quickly choose the last dressing that I tasted, which was a good choice!  I really enjoyed Chopt! I can't wait to taste the soup!! I'll definitey be back, I may even order in next time. The atmosphere was very welcoming, spacious and clean!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my salad last night! Though I could have used a bit more dressing, I know I really didn't need the extra calories lmbo! But over all it was delicious. I ordered the Sweet & Smokey Chipotle salad and opted for tofu instead of chicken. I'm choosing vegan options and this was a great substitute also I did the Mexican goddess dressing. Oh and I included the red curry lentil soup, my only pit is their cups should be bigger for $5.50. The cups are quite small especially when you're ordering soup separate and not a half of your meal. But this meal over all was also a great option for my Daniel Fast because it provided Quinoa mixture {grain} so all around I was winning spiritually, healthy, and fully. Thanks Chopt for satisfying my late dinner hunger pain."}
{"text":"Awesome low cal fare. My Mexican soup was on point and the jalapeño notes were amazing. My friend ordered a traditional salad (I think it was the Korean street one?) and went absolutely crazy. Top notch fare and with a healthy twist--10/10 recommended to anyone in CLT area!"}
{"text":"This was my boyfriend's favorite restaurant in Charlotte before he relocated. I still hear the occasional \"I miss Chopt!\" That was the first place I took him when he came back for a visit. I hope it grows to more locations!   The process is very simple, and the staff is always generous in offering a substitute ingredient if you don't want something included in a certain menu item's make-up. They always chop and add dressing to the customer's satisfaction. Also, the bowls the salads come in make them very portable if you are on the go.  The whole set up makes it really easy to eat vegetarian, which I appreciate. Also, their lemonades are perfect. They sweeten with honey instead of sugar, and it's the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place and I'm happy to know they are building one closer to my neighborhood this place gets busy but it's worth it"}
{"text":"Huge portions, great choice, friendly staff, very clean! Definitely going back!  Lots of choices available and the food was really good!"}
{"text":"Crowded pre-Christmas rush at Park Road Shopping Center. I know I'm crazy but I thought I'd try one of the new restaurants at the shopping center. I walk up to Chopt and am met with a line out the door. Ugh but I did stay for a minute and watched. Inside was what looked like a well oiled machine cranking along. The line receded as I stood at the door so I decided to take a chance. I found myself in a sparkling and energetic environment. The line progressed a lot faster than I expected mainly due to Henry Ford overseeing the assembly line. This manager was happily going up and down the line answering questions and moving things along. When I made it up to the start of the food prep line, a smiling server was happy to answer more of my questions. I loved watching these hard working people make all these different salads quickly, with precision and apparently with great joy. I mean everyone seemed happy to be working there. That makes a difference to me. And yes, they actually do chop every salad.  The menu is different, interesting, and most importantly, I think that was the best salad I've had in a while if ever. The unusual dressings are very good. I personally really like going to Crisp and I go a lot. Chopt is Crisp on steroids!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, KUDOS to Charlotte for getting a NYC bred (via Northern VA) salad restaurant!  May there be many, many more.  In my first visit I got the mezze (from the \"Destination Salad\" list which changes regularly).  The kebab chicken tasted like it was prepped offsite as it had zero flavor.  Everything else tasted very fresh.  Finally--flavorful salad dressings that don't make up 25% of a salad's calories.  Not as good as my favorite salad in Charlotte--Big Apple Deli's Greek salad with grilled chicken (huge portion for $8)--but worthy of putting in the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"You choose, they top and then it's all Chopt! So cool! Great experience, great salad options...so busy in here though...it's crazy really...all the chopping, the long lines, the people! It's a mad house for salad lovers! I don't know how the workers keep track of everything that's going on. I felt dizzy when I finally got out of there, but I'm ready to brave it again! The salad was great and worth it for me to enter this place again.  Friendly staff, fast service...well as fast as they can given the amount of people that are in here at peak times. Great toppings and great flavors for the salad dressings. Really different salad experience! I had the steak something and then the Nashville chicken ceasar. Both were very different, both were very good! Side note: handicapped parking nearby, and accessible entrance and seating available!"}
{"text":"I really love the salads here; so healthy! I've always ordered off the menu, but you can custom-make anything. I almost always get the mexican goddess dressing (avocado based!) and I also recently tried the hot honey vinaigrette which was nice. The staff is very friendly and make suggestions if you're not sure what you want. They also let you taste the dressings before they add it to your salad. There's a small slice of sourdough included with every salad too! I just wish I lived closer so I could frequent it more often!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place. They have great salad creations and also give you the option to build your own with 4 \"choppings\" included. It was really busy when I got there. Once I ordered they sent me to get my salad chopped. They even let me tell them how much dressing I wanted which I thought was great because usually they just put it on at any other place. I got an iced tea and added lemonade to make an Arnold Palmer. A lot of the items are locally sourced which I LOVED! My friend got a steakhouse salad which she said was great. She added chicken instead of steak because it looked gray and not fresh. She said the chicken was a good substitute. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I want to love Chop't. I really do. I've been here on at least a dozen occasions. Every time I come here though, I feel a slight sense of disappointment. Almost always the chicken just doesn't taste right - slightly too chewy. And the Chicken Tinga portion you receive varies GREATLY depending on the associate who makes it for you. The free bread they give you with each salad almost always tastes stale and is pretty small.   Yes, having a 'chopped' salad is cool. But for $10+ for a salad, it needs to be fantastic. This place never is!"}
{"text":"I came across this location while waiting for my oil change to be completed across the street. It was a bit overwhelming at first due to the assembly line and the crowd. The staff were very knowledgeable, friendly, and most importantly patient. Joel was very nice and interacted with customers to obtain feedback. I decided to create my own as I could not decide on one from their menu. I expected it to be bland, but the ceasar dressing was spectacular.  Everything was fresh, the avacado was extra but delicious! It is pricey for a salad, but the overall service was worth it and I kept my cute salad bowl!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Healthy and tasty salads and quinoa bowls. Try their raspberry hibiscus tea."}
{"text":"After three (3) visits, I can say.... the steakhouse isn't worth it.  The cali green gooddess dressing on it is lovely. It's lime based or acidic and I got it on the side wishing I had it on the greens now.  The lettuce is a romaine & mix. The mix isn't good. Sorry not sorry. Its the truth.  Santa Fe is GREAT withOUT meat.  Kebab Salad is okay. I don't want grilled peppers nor onions so ewwww. Tzatziki sauce is good. The pita chips help make it worthwhile too.   I paid $0.20 more today so IDK if they charged me for the dressing on the side or what.   I'll try the Classic Cobb next.  Why 3 stars? The service is inconsistent and moody.  Sometimes they'll banter and other times, nope! Of 3 visits, I have only been offered the bread ONCE.Even with a manager checking me out but everyone offers a drink. So if you can upsell me a drink then provide my half slice of bread.   NO one mentions - download the app.  5 stars for the cutting and seasonal fruit (pears and apples right now) 0 stars for the flavorless steak 5 stars for the dressing options  0 stars for no raw onions like not red, white, yellow. Zilch. Nien   3 stars for the employees that want to be there."}
{"text":"Soooo... I've been going here since they opened. Hence why I've previously rated them at a 5. NOW!! Things are not too good. The rating has dropped to 9. A co-worker and I ate there yesterday and both of us are suffering from food poisoning. I'm soo disappointed in this place. Even there customer service could definitely use some major work!!!  Technique and concept is good but that's it."}
{"text":"Absolutely best fresh salad I have had in a long time. It was so filling and more than enough, I had enough left for dinner. I'll be back tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so upset it took me so long to come to Chop't! I was so impressed with the assembly line. It was almost too overwhelming that I didn't know what to get or where to even start, which is a good thing. There were an endless amount of toppings and options. I could easily eat lunch and dinner here everyday and have different combos each time!  The menu offers a good amount of signature salads that stay the same, 3 destination salads that I think change periodically, and then of course the build your own salad. The BYOS includes 4 toppings and then every one after that is an extra 79 cents. The dressings, OMG, I've never seen so many options!! They put 2 dressing with each salad that you can choose from or you can be adventurous and try your own! Beware, some of the dressings are spicy!   I originally got the palm beach salad but I didn't realize the dressing was spicy. I can usually had me a bit of spice but this was intense so I had to ask for a new one. I tried the Mexican Caesar salad no jalapeños and regular Caesar dressing, omg so good! I loved that they crushed tortilla chips and put them in! Gave it a delicious crunch. My boyfriend got the steak salad-again delicious. All the ingredients were super fresh and perfect!   The only downfall is the price. It can get pricey especially when you want to do add-ons. For two salads, 2 drinks, and 3 add-ons, it came to 30$. I don't know if it's just me but that seems a bit steep for salads. But nonetheless, they were good, I just won't come here as much as I would if the prices were a bit lower."}
{"text":"Salad is salad, yes, but I've never experienced it like this before. Chopt and it's staff gave me a unique experience that'll have me coming back for more!  I ordered the \"Classic Cobb\" with the Lemon Tahini dressing instead of the Dijon. It was amazing. You can customize your own personal salad or pick from one of the many available options. After you get all the ingredients you get sent to a personal salad mixer (a worker) who asks you what dressing, and hand cuts/mixes your salad to your liking.  The atmosphere is very relaxing. They have both indoor and outdoor seating (minimal outdoor). The staff would come by and check on us to ensure we didn't need anything throughout our visit as well.  My $10 Cobb salad was PLENTY to fill me up and even take home to have for the following day. Everything tasted very fresh and amazing. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Paid 10 bucks for half a salad. I got home and was hungry only to be left unsatisfied. I usually have nothing but positive things to say but this was just wrong ."}
{"text":"The new arboretum location is beautiful!  Beautiful open seating and booths.  Lots of staff behind the counter all working hard.  Salads are creative and tasty!  I just wish at this price point they used real bite sized pieces of bacon.  Mine seemed more like bacon bits.  I would have liked more toppings and less lettuce."}
{"text":"No. Just no. My first and only experience was awful the only reason I am going back 1 more time is because I got a free meal that I'm not going to waste. It was my first time doing to Chopt and I heard such amazing things about it so I was excited to try it. My sisters and I walked it in, it smelled great, the decor was beautiful! We grabbed menus and deciding what to order there was an employee that walked past us about 6 time and every single time she passed she asked are we ready yet. We felt rushed and we weren't even in line. We were just reading the menu! The people the served my sisters were great but the girl that did my salad was so rude!!!!! I told her it was my first time there and I didn't know what I was doing she replied \"so are you ready or not\". I started asking questions and every response had an attitude behind it. I asked if I could taste one of the salad dressings and then asked to taste the ranch she replied \"its regular ranch\". I didn't asked what kind of ranch it was I asked to taste it! She said \"are you gonna give me the cup\" She had an attitude for no reason which was not appreciated. She chopped my salad wayyy too much and wayyy to much dressing. It was awful! I also got a Mexican soup of course she described it with \"vegetable soup\" I was fed up at this point. Btw the juices or tea or whatever it is by the door are not good. I called back that night and the manager apologized and sent my a free meal but that is the only reason I am going to go back! I'd rather get a salad somewhere else."}
{"text":"I hope they chop this store soon. I was so excited to see that Chopt has made its way to Charlotte. My experience in the DC locations were so much better. I walked in, there were water on the floor which made it slippery. They did zero in trying to explain to me the concept, or welcome me. I got the creole shrimp salad in a wrap. Overpriced and not good, way too sour. The lady burnt my wrap the first time, she had to pick it off the press piece by piece. They told me usually they always burn the first one of the day, ok fair point, maybe could have taken better precaution or test it out in the AM before customers arrive. The wrap by the way are not good. The shrimps were teeny tiny and not fresh. The bacon over powering and the recommended creamy dressing was so sour I feel like I was eating a lemon.   I saw another worker sitting the front of the store eating a takeout from elsewhere, I can't support you if you don't even support your own food, and not even try to hide it, eating it wide open at the front of the store by the windows."}
{"text":"I religiously went to Chopt until I ordered the California Sonoma Ceaser salad two weeks ago and got sick for three days. I called the Park Road location to report the issue and the manager was \"on break\" and they said they'd leave a message. Never got a call back. I've talked to 2 other people who have gotten sick off the same salad. Sharing so someone else doesn't get sick too and since the management doesn't seem to care about the issue."}
{"text":"Always a great place when you're looking for something filling but healthy. I've had the Palm beach (first timers favorite), chicken tinga quinoa/kale bowl, and the braised Greek quinoa/kale bowl. My least favorite was the Greek one, had a weird dressing but keep in mind you can change them. I always go for the tex-mex ranch, it's a bit spicy I love it. The atmosphere is great! they have plenty indoor and outdoor seating which is so nice in this shopping center. It does get super busy and loud during the lunch/dinner hours but it is never a long wait. I've never had any problems with any of the employees, they get the job done. I love their fresh raspberry lemonade and their green tea. They also have honey that you can add to sweeten your drinks. To top it all off... they give complimentary bread :)"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that I have a chopt closer to me now. So I went over today and the new store is beautiful. I love the decor of this location. The quality of the food was consistent with the others.  I ordered something new and I didn't enjoy it as much as my usual but that's a personal choice. I had no complaints simply love this place."}
{"text":"I went here the other night with my daughters and was pleasantly surprised. I know the house dressing the Green Goddess is there most requested dressing but I simply tried their Ranch and let me tell you it was a very good ranch. I love that even their signature salad you can add and subtract what you would like in your salad this is total customization. However my negative for this particular chopped restaurant franchise is that the selection of beverages aren't far-reaching and for those of us who would choose to have carbonation you are excluded. Their lemonades are very tasteless and their teas aren't good as well. Even if you are opposed to soda at least have some drink options that are better tasting epic fail to me for beverage choices. However the salad experience was very good."}
{"text":"Chopt salad is just ok. I've been here about a dozen times and my experiences have always been hit or miss. I've complained in the past about getting rotten avocado and being out of white balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  I went tonight to redeem a credit I have on my Chopt app and was reminded why I rarely come here. The employee rushed through my salad and missed multiple ingredients, which I had to point out when my salad was already on the chopping station. The cobb salad comes with bacon, but since I don't eat pork, I always sub it for double avocado. I noticed that my salad had the normal amount of avocado and he had forgotten the egg that comes with it. Thankfully, I asked another nice employee about it and she confirmed I was right about what comes with the classic cobb salad and got the ingredients for me.   I also barely got any panko chicken. They used to give you a few chicken tenders and chop them up for you - now it seems like you only get small pieces that they chop up. They've changed the bowls and salad dressing cups and it seems like you get less food than you got in the past. I guess the new trend is paying more for less food.  I noticed when I left and looked at my app, that had showed that I had $12.71 in Chopt credit while I was in line, only $5 of it had been used, the rest was zeroed out and the rest of the amount was charged to my credit card! I know this is an app issue and not the restaurant, but seriously? That's the main reason why I came!  All in all, it's a decent spot, especially if you're looking for a healthy option, but certainly not somewhere I'd go to regularly."}
{"text":"This is a new favorite lunch spot for me! I wish there was one closer to home.   I wasn't going to try this place out because the line was so long. BUT the staff was in high gear and it ended up only being around 10 minutes until I paid the cashier.   The entire staff were very friendly, and knowledgeable. The food taste amazing and Fresh!   Can't wait for lunch here again!"}
{"text":"Well...  we tried to visit Chopt today only to find that it was literally standing room only.  We simply didn't want a salad that bad, so we left.  I guess this is a great problem for Chopt to have, but it wasn't helpful today when we only have an hour for lunch  :-(  Hopefully it'll calm down after a few more weeks and we'll give it another try  :-)"}
{"text":"Good stuff but adding broccolini leaf to the Chicken Tinga was a cardinal sin."}
{"text":"It was surprisingly hectic when I walked into Chopt at 2:30 on a Friday, but I was greeted at the door with a menu and ushered into a line.   Basically you either pick a set salad (there are no sandwiches, even the confusingly-named  \"salad sandwiches\" are just salads) or make your own a la carte. It's a big menu, with lots of options and add-on pricing. It seemed like pricing could get steep if you had lots of mix-ins.     It then got a little confusing from there. I picked a set salad and somehow the person working on my salad didn't get it right. She didn't really even make eye contact with me and she walked off (it was hard to keep track of her) She then handed me a slip with an incorrect salad listed, and before I could correct her she said \"go to station 2\" and walked away. There were no signs just lines of people. I looked for station two, and went to the second cash register (that was wrong), so then they pointed me to the right place...I think signs would be helpful for when it's really busy.   I would have just went with the salad they gave me at that point but I couldn't eat a main ingredient in this one so they re-made it for me quickly. After your salad is assembled they take it out and place it on a table where they chop it into tiny bits and add the dressing. The salad came with really good free bread and they had a nice selection of teas and infused water. My salad was under $10, but was huge and contained chicken so I felt like it was fairly reasonable.   I ended up with the Po-Boy Salad Sandwich (salad) Overall the flavor was good, I didn't love the panko-crusted chicken (it wasn't crispy and was cold) so I would choose grilled next time. I would say it was a good salad and a nice option for fast-casual.   Now that I understand what I'm getting myself into, I think the process will be easier next time... I hope!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and enjoyed it both times. Each time I did the customer craft and created my own salad and each time it was delicious. I got the falafel for protein and it was very tasty. Their Mexican goddess dressing is dangerous. It's so damn good! I allow myself to eat out for lunch one day a week and I'm pretty sure I'll be making my way back to Chop't many times."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to salad places if I can place my order in advance through the app.    The new bee keeper salad is sooooo delicious!  That has been my go to lately.  My favorite menu staple is the chicken tinga.  I get it chopped and switch out the cheese for goat cheese.    The salads are a little pricy but they are high quality. You can create your own as well!"}
{"text":"My new favorite salad spot!  I'm moving to the area in 3 weeks and have already been to Chopt twice in the past 2 weeks while exploring the area.  They have incredibly fresh and delicious salads on the menu with plenty to choose from!  My wife and I always go in with the intentions of splitting one but they are so amazing I just can't share!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for people who get excited about salad. Believe it or not, there are a lot of those people. A little intimidating on first visit. They have a whole wall of different kinds of lettuce. The manager stands right there to help customers out though. I went with one of their featured salads and it was great. I thought, theres no way I will eat this whole thing. Then I did. Still no regrets. I tried a couple of their beverages and they were tasty! I wish this was a more convenient spot for me to stop in, because I would definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Fresh! Fresh! Fresh!   My girlfriend and i were planning a lunch on my day off and per the norm I hit the computer machine to check the interwebs of yelp.com! Alas! Here i scroll upon the great land of Chopt Creative Salad Company...  As you enter you are welcomed to a bright, airy, clean and modern interior. And then BAM! it hits you in the face the: the deliciously large menu board. plenty to choose from based on your hunger level.  She chose the crunchy Vietnamese salad and He chose the Kebab Bobb Salad. You place your order at the counter, they place all the ingredients in a bowl and hand it over to the chop master.. and chop and chop they do right to your chopped liking. OMSG Oh! My! Salad! God! Incredibly fresh and delicious!!!  No sodas to choose from - great idea - but they do have a large selection of natural teas to quench your thirst!  Yes, it can be a bit pricey .. but well worth it and oh so delicious!"}
{"text":"When I moved to back to Charlotte from D.C., I instantly went to Chop't's website and asked them when they were opening a location in Charlotte. Nine months later, they showed up and the only thing that would have made me happier is if it were more conveniently located.   My favorite thing about Chop't is the spicy salad dressing options. They are so delicious! Do yourself a favor though, get the app, place your order online, and you can skip the long line and grab your food super quick.   FYI, after Chop't showed up, I went to Cava's website and said \"hey! Chop't is killing it down here, come feed Charlotte some Mediterranean food\""}
{"text":"Love this place. I love the drink section as well. I'm so glad that they opened one where I live (ballantyne /blakeney). My favorite is the steakhouse salad. A bit pricey but I don't mind it. The service is always good and prompt. The people there are always nice the few times I've been."}
{"text":"I feel bad for the average rating but hear me out. I walked in and waited for my friend. I've never been to this place ever but had an idea of how the concept was. When we walked to the line, I told the girl I wanted romaine lettuce and to add steak to my salad. She asked me if I didn't want any other toppings to it? So, since I'm new to all this, I thought maybe she wanted my toppings first and then let her know I wanted steak later. It was pretty obvious I was new but she didn't really walk me through with anything. They had a good variety of items. You can pick up to 4 items and anything over that is .79 cents extra. It can definitely get expensive. You get a ton of lettuce but I don't think it was worth it with the little toppings. She walked me over to the gentleman that was gonna chop my salad. He was mixing it and chopping it up and then asked me about my dressing. Wait...what about my steak? He said it wasn't written on there. So you had to go all the way down the line to get my steak. I didn't know the steak was gonna be cold. I thought it would be warm because I've had steak salads before.   I paid over $13 for my salad. Nice and interesting experience but definitely not worth it for me."}
{"text":"They were out of the featured dressings on several of the salads, out of balsamic vinaigrette, the store looks like it had not been swept or cleaned in hours and the manager was completely disengaged from the customers and the employees, very disappointed in the fact especially that the manager made no attempt to assist the employees or address the customers about things they were out of, this is the salad shop you don't run out of four dressings"}
{"text":"Wife took me to lunch here yesterday. Glad she did because this place is the BOMB!! The service was good and the food is even better. I have not had a salad this good in a long time. They have an assortment of salads to choose from or you can create your own. I had some sort of chicken cobb salad and wifey had a veggie salad with chipotle dressing (hot). They have a drink bar with different kinds of tea and lemonade, all were pretty tasty. They also have a cucumber and lemon water choice, didn't try that. The atmosphere is very casual and clean. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"(THE RATING IS FOR THE NEW BOWL SIZE ONLY) Stopped in this past weekend to get a delicious Chopt salad being I had got enough points to get $10.00 off my order. Much to my surprise Chopt (Park Rd Location) has changed the serving bowls. The bowls now appear to be much smaller than the clear bowls they used to serve the salads in and you get a lot less salad for the same price. I asked about the bowls and was told they had just recently changed and the other 2 locations do not use the same bowls. Sorry to say, BUT! I will not be going back to the Park road location until the bowls are changed back. The rating is for the BOWL SIZE ONLY and not the salad. The salads are still fresh and delicious as always."}
{"text":"I didn't mind the line or the process or the fact that this is a chain. The food was fresh and the portion was way larger than one person needs. The reason for my review only being 2 stars is that the chopping is odd. It's so abrupt and messy. I didn't like that my whole salad got chopped into little pieces for me as if it were pre-chewed. It was heavily dressed and too big to finish so half of it went to waste. I wouldn't come here again because it just isn't for me."}
{"text":"Chopt is across the street from my work so this is a nice healthy option for me. The issue is that a lot of other people feel the same way. They are almost always packed at lunch time.   Here's what I love: they have super fresh ingredients and large portion sizes.  Here's what I don't: the staff expect you to know what you want right away because they work fast, so if you don't know or you aren't familiar with the concept, you may be put off. Also, they never use enough dressing for the huge amount of lettuce you get. I always have to ask for more and more dressing and then I feel like I'm a hog. also. Since the portions are large, I have to throw away my salad since it's all mixed together and it doesn't last till the next day without getting soggy. (I think I will ask for a side of dressing from now on) also, it's a pricey lunch"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! The food is always fresh, reasonable prices, clean, and the staff is always friendly. Betty is my favorite! I come here for lunch almost every day. Make sure you download the app!"}
{"text":"Oh Chopt. I live in Charlotte, NC and go to the Park Road location. I used love this place -- i'm talking would get 3 salads a week and used the online app to get rewards.   Within the last month or 2, some of the Chopt locations have downsized their portions while keeping the price the same. Instead of the clear salad bowls, they are using the same bowls they use for their grain bowls (brown bottom with clear top), which are a good half the size.   After the first time this happened, I just assumed that they'd run out of the clear bowls, but I've been back since and they have in fact gotten rid of the clear bowls and downsized the salads, keeping the high price.   If you inquire about this change on Instagram, you'll get a generic \"please email your questions or concerns here\" -- they will give you a free salad for your complaint, but not really satisfy or answer the actual concerns. If you want a free salad though, just email them and tell them you're disappointed in their bowl downgrades. A free salad is the LEAST they could offer after charging $13 for half the salad they used to give.   Also -- if you go look on Instagram to see if others have noticed this, Chopt is deleting these negative comments -- i've commented twice and  had my comments deleted. So they really are picking and choosing what they want you to see. I don't ever come to Google, but I think it's ridiculous that they are not only ripping off their customers, but they are also lying by omission.   Will not be going back unless the issue is addressed by either a larger portion for the money or they lower the price. A $14 side salad is a little ridic, and while Chopt is delicious, it aint that good."}
{"text":"This was my first Chop't experience. I ordered the California Steakhouse salad and I was really skeptical once I saw that the steak was served cold. I'm also not a fan of cilantro and there is cilantro in the California Goddess dressing that is served with this salad. I got the dressing anyway since it was recommended. While you could definitely taste the cilantro in the dressing, and the steak was cold, the salad was amazing!!! I can't wait to go back and try another one!"}
{"text":"Awesome salad joint. This will be a frequent stop for me. Save me from my bad eating habits!"}
{"text":"I reaaaallllyy wanted to enjoy this place.  I'd been craving a chopped salad and we stumbled upon this spot via a yelp search.  Vegan options, too?! Yay!  We ordered two salads and while my husbands spicy cashew soba noodles was the better of the two I was left feeling like we had made a mistake in how we ordered.  I got a Mendocino market salad and originally accepted the dressing the chopper added thinking it would be dressed enough.  My mistake, cool, no problem.  I went and got another side of dressing to add to it - no charge- definitely another plus.  We liked the bread and the salads both tasted okay but mine honestly felt like it was shredding the inside of my mouth.  I'm a salad and veggie fiend - I don't mind a little roughage but something about this really made for a poor eating experience.  I will say the restaurant was beautiful, staff was helpful and friendly - if it was a rating for those factors alone we would be looking at five stars, unfortunately I'll be picking kale out of my sore mouth for a while after the disappointment of a salad.  Edit: I should have been more communicative with the staff on hand about my experience.  Ultimately I decided that the salad couldn't be \"fixed\" within my dietary preferences (keeping plant based - the seasoned meats seemed to be hugely popular with everyone else ordering).  They have reached out to me which I sincerely appreciate and are making an effort to see if this is a problem unique to me or if the salad has any specific issues they need to address.  Thanks, Chopt, for making an effort!"}
{"text":"My first Chopt experience was superb! We came in around 3pm and there were relatively a good number of customers inside. Staff were courteous and pleasant. I ordered the Saigon Chicken while my boyfriend had the Shrimp Summer Roll. I like how they offer the complimentary breads at check out since not all want to eat salad with breads. We were impressed by the huge portions of the salad and were even more impressed by how fresh and delicious it tasted. I was thinking about it all night and decided to come back the following day.  This time, I came alone and arrived around noon. The line was long but I don't mind the wait. Staff remained courteous and pleasant but they look to be in chaos. I still ordered Saigon Chicken because I couldn't get over it! When I got my order, the amount of salad wasn't the same as yesterday. Today, it just barely crossed the midline compared to the one I had yesterday. Ingredients weren't as abundant. Probably because everyone was in a hurry to make a salad bowl.   What saddens me is that there is a huge difference in service in different times of day. Service should be consistent all throughout the day weather it's peak or off peak."}
{"text":"Great location, beautiful restaurant. I had the opportunity to try them out (twice) when they were just opening and offering free salads. I fell in like! Local ingredients, creative menu options. The Chicken Santorini and Chicken Tinga do not disappoint! I added falafel to both items. Cost is about $13. Generous portions. If you're worried about getting more toppings and less shrubbery, you're really not wanting a salad. Salads are customizable. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Plentiful & filling, the Mexicali Vegan is my favorite salad ever and super light on calories. The lemonade here is also to be desired. If you don't get the Mexicali Vegan atleast try your salad with the Mexican Goddess dressing. I want to get some for my own salads at home!"}
{"text":"The only issues with Chopt is it is soooo busy at lunch you don't always get the most comfortable seating arrangement. Maybe that will settle down after a bit. It's also about $12.50 a person for a salad and a drink so I just get water most of the time now.   There are many different salad choices and you may feel overwhelmed and you can always create your own salad as well which seems even more overwhelming as you get close to the front of the line and have to make decisions but that's probably a personal problem of mine.   I've had the chicken kabob salad and the Steakhouse. The Steakhouse is only 320 calories and I go light on the Steakhouse Blue Cheese dressing which says 120 calories but that's probably the hard part is to do determine how many servings worth they are putting on as they wait for you to say when. Of course you can get it on the side but that seems to defeat the purpose of the great work the salad preppers do for you.   After you've been through the process once you will get it but you start at the front with your order. The first person hands you off to one of 4 salad stations where you wait on line behind others as they make the salads. Then you take your salad and pay."}
{"text":"Overall not impressed with the experience.   First, customer service. The lady who is the first person you interact with was short and impatient. There was a group of three guys in front of me who were confused and couldn't figure things out. You could see she was annoyed yet did nothing to try to help them understand the process. When I came up next, she was still unpleasant. As she made my custom order, her big focus was on the price of my add ons. Even though she stated at the start that I get 4 and anything extra costs more. I wanted to say, \"I get it, I get it\" at one point she was so adamant about pointing it out repeatedly. Now the chopper guy was friendly as was the girl at the register. But when she started bagging my plastic tub I told her I needed a tray because I was staying. Well apparently the First Lady was supposed to ask me if I was staying or going and never did. So while other folks in the place were eating off nice dishes, there I was eating out of the plastic tub.   Ok fine, so she's not the most helpful or friendliest of people. So how's the food?  As I do a lot of work uptown, I have frequented Crunch Bistro, so I found myself comparing to them as my baseline.  1. Size of the bowl here is much smaller. I can always get two meals out of Crunch. Not here.  2. First Lady did precise scoops w the ladles. Probably just a company policy but in comparison to Crunch as my only other experience, who does overflowing scoops, it was disappointing to me.  3. Especially because of the price. That was my real WOW moment. It was almost $16 for a custom salad with chicken and 5 toppings and a drink. The drink alone was $3!!!! For such a small bowl and a not-so-tasty Arnold Palmer in a small-ish cup, I couldn't not believe the total. I could have gone to any sit down restaurant and end up with a smaller bill. And at Crunch I got a much larger bowl and drink for under $10.   4. I prefer hot grilled chicken on my salad. The lady making mine again wasn't helpful. When I asked about meat she pointed at the cold toppings and said chicken or streak. Then as the next guy was chopping my salad I notice the lady next to me ask for chicken and apparently there are hot chicken options where you chop (though both were seasoned, not plain). Which she didn't mention. She's definitely not new visitor friendly.   5. Topping selections were nothing special. But they were fresh and did taste good. Salad lettuce was fresh. Complimentary bread was a nice add.   6. I did really like the space and the outdoor seating. Music was a bit loud so sat outside and was a beautiful day for it. Liked that they have a huge screen on one wall inside to allow for fresh air. Wish more eateries had this type of setup. Not cozy at all but a clean and open space.  7. Almost forgot. Container lid is a pain to get off. There's no lip to help u remove it. Had to get my nail between the tight layers and that actually hurt my thumb (I have short nails)  So not sure if it's the hype or just the chain requirements, but so not impressed with this place. I can't even blame location because one would think a salad place uptown would charge higher prices. Maybe because it's the only one in the area, who knows.   So unless I'm working from home and really, really, REALLY craving a salad, I won't be back. Overpriced with cranky staff just isn't the experience I was in the middle of my day."}
{"text":"Let's face it, sometimes it's hard to get excited about eating a salad. Chopt changes all of that. HOORAY FOR DELICIOUS, QUICK, AND HEALTHY!  Real talk: your first visit here you will probably be overwhelmed. They expect you to be and are prepared to help you navigate the menu and options. You can order one of the featured salads on the menu or build your own. The ingredients are so fresh, the dressings all so delicious. There's also grain, noodle, and quinoa bowl options. I love that Chopt doesn't offer any sodas. They have several brewed in house teas and lemonade type drinks. Oh, and they have the good ice!   This place gets absolutely slammed during lunch. People all the way backed up to the door. Pro tip: skip the line and download the app to order ahead."}
{"text":"So excited to have a Chopt in the Arboretum! The salads are delicious, the space is nice, and I appreciate the effort made to source ingredients locally. This has become go-to for a tasty and healthy salad."}
{"text":"They have so many options. If you get tired of the same old salad you have to come to chopt. This was my first time here and they live up to all of the reviews!! I ordered the Santa Fe with seasonal roasted squash no tomatoes and add panko fried chicken. I got extra dressing on the side. I love how everything is mixed together with the dressing. The salad was so big that I was able to share with a friend."}
{"text":"Fancy salad, large portion size but definitely not worth the price Only thing special about this place is you can customize every aspect of your salad right from type of leaves to dressing and croutons"}
{"text":"Why isn't this in Chicago?! My brother introduced me to Chopt after a week of eating not-so healthily and feeling guilty about it. The line wasn't too bad and we were greeted by someone who oriented us to how to order. The menu is nicely organized with calorie counts for every item, down to the salad dressings. Overwhelmed with the selections, I opted to try one of the \"First-Time Favorites\", particularly the Santa Fe, but was concerned how spicy the recommended dressing would be. The guy made several recs for alternatives, including their best-selling \"Mexican Goddess\" or the \"California Goddess\". I appreciated not only that you can sub out the dressing but that you can sample them before committing. I opted for the Mexican Goddess for the subtle spice and cilantro vs. the creamier California version. There is an assembly line of people putting your order together that finishes at the chopping station, where your salad gets chopped and dressed to your liking before getting tossed all together. The to-go bowls are clear and deep, making it perfect to take the salad home. You also can get a complementary slice of bread with your order. I really liked the Santa Fe Salad - the ingredients were fresh and the fried onions homemade. We came back a few days later for a late night dinner. The Kale Caesar was also very good."}
{"text":"So the whole theme here is that they chop up your salad so it's all in neat little bite sized pieces and then they will ask you if it's \"chopt\" enough for you and that's all well and good, but not everything in a salad has to be chopped up into tiny pieces. They had fresh ingredients, but I really didn't enjoy the combination of ingredients in the majority of their options and that was fairly off putting. I got the falafel and did not realize they would demolish the falafel into tiny pieces destroying all that brings me joy about falafel. I realize that you can ask them not to do that, but that kind of defeats the point of getting a salad from Chopt. The rest of the flavors in the falafel salad didn't seem to work too well together either. Not everything needs kale in it. Unless you love kale, then you'd probably love chopt."}
{"text":"I am so excited that Chopt is in Charlotte, Park Rd no less. The best salad place I have ever been to. Done. The best. Selection , variety can not be matched. Great customer service as well.  Update. 5 weeks in and the customer service is still fantastic. I am blown away at how well they treat everyone and earn the repeat business"}
{"text":"This make your own salad concept is everything. I used to come here about once a week when I lived in Charlotte. The staff here is friendly and you can tell all the ingredients are fresh. The way they chop the salad makes it so you get dressing and your toppings in almost every bite.   Personally favorite is the Kale Caesar salad with grilled chicken.    The only thing I don't like about this place is that ordering your food is so confusing the first time you come. It really makes zero sense. They should change that or have signs."}
{"text":"This is my third time being there and it's been great every time. Every employee is helpful and friendly. The amount of salad given is extremely fair for the amount paid. The salads are about the same price as Panera, but way better. You get to build your own salad or pick one theirs off a menu. You also get to choose the amount of dressing on your salad which is convenient. If you go around lunch time it'll probably be busy, but the line moves quickly. Chopt has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"The only reason that this review isn't 5 stars is because if you go anytime close to noon you aren't going to enjoy the wait for your delicious salad. This place may single handedly change the lunch time for folks in this pocket of Charlotte to 11am.  The salads are so good and I love that while you can make pick from the board and customize as you want-the utensils they use to create your salad help maintain portion sizes so you know about how many calories your customization will cost ya. It's a great set-up and you won't be disappointed if you can beat the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Mmmm mmmmm mmmmm Chopt is not officially open in Charlotte but today they are serving free salads to get the buzz around town . Make sure you add this delicious gourmet salad eatery to your check in list !   You can choose from one of the Chopt salads or craft your own Chopt salad with a variety of lettuce options such as kale, arugula, spinach , romaine, or a mix . There is an assortment of fresh fruits, veggies , cheese/dairies, grains , proteins , and even crunch for a true salad artist . Also , for the avid meal preppers , calories are included for each menu item . I love the assortment of dressings as well they have your all time favorites , speciality Chopt mixes , or some low cal options they call \"Spa\" dressings .   The menu doesn't display the specials for each location , but if you want something with a little more weight , Chopt also has \"Salad sandwiches\" , pitas, side snacks , etc in store .  The pricing can get a little expensive for a salad but the quality and selection is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I love CHOPT. I ate at the one in Ballantyne and they still have the large clear bowls. Today I decided to eat at my main one (which is this location) and they had smaller paper bowls. The price is still the same, just less food, disappointing!"}
{"text":"If you love salads, this is the place to go. I like going here for a healthier option for lunch but $14 for a salad is just ridiculous. I would frequent here more if the prices were lower. It's just a salad..."}
{"text":"This has become a healthy dinner option for me and my family since it opened. The salads are fresh, generous and tasty. We will continue to frequent and support this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great addition to Park Road shopping center! Obsessed with this place. The ingredients are fresh, the personnel is attentive, and the experience is  pleasant. Even in the busy moments the employees remain calm! They are willing to work with you to make your meal exactly to your specifications. The atmosphere is not as cool as the food, but most of the time I do take out. Thanks! Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Eh, I feel pretty indifferent about my experience. I eat a homemade salad for lunch daily, and I've gotten pretty good about making creative ones so that it doesn't get boring. I was eager to try Chopt though as an alternative to days when I am feeling lazy about making a lunch.   When I went the line wasn't too crazy although parking can be a bit interesting. Inside it's very sleek and modern but some signage about where to line up to order and where to stand for the chopping station would help to lessen the cluster. To help, you order all the way to left. If the board menu is too overwhelming, there are card menus nearby on the wall.    I tried the Mavericks grain salad, which has quinoa, scallion, corn, cilantro, and avocado on a bed of kale and cabbage blend. I added grilled chicken for extra protein. I tried the chipotle vinaigrette with a squeeze of lime as my dressing which helped up the flavor profile. The chipotle definitely has some heat to it though. I though the size was underwhelming for the price. It looked like you get maybe more bang for your buck if you create your own."}
{"text":"Really yummy salads and friendly staff! Even if you don't like salads, you would like these salads. Have other options besides salad too. I got the salad with the hearts of palm in it--- huge servings, good food!"}
{"text":"Great salad for fast food - went with the Mexican Caesar and it was great. You get the option to add how much dressing you want which cuts down the calories and how mushy the lettuce gets. Clean restaurant and shopping center. On a nice day sit outside."}
{"text":"Chopt has won me over AND my Hubs!!! If he says it's good and hearty then the sky must be falling.  This is a \"meat and potato\" man that can actually have a salad here and feel full.  Me- I'm easy to please.  Great location, clean space, outdoor tables (only a few) friendly staff and a pretty easy menu. Salads are a nice portion size and there is something for everyone.   Now if only they could serve beer or wine.  :-)"}
{"text":"As a transplant New Yorker I appreciate this restaurants city style approach to fast casual. When everything is flowing it's a very efficient ordering process. My only complaint is that the layout of the restaurant itself prohibits the flow of customers. Often when busy, those waiting at a chopping station are in the way of those waiting to order. The process and its capacity for confusion has definitely turned off some of my friends to the restaurant, including my fiancé. But I'm a huge fan never the less.   The food is delicious every time. My favorites are the two warm grain salads the braised Greek and chicken Tinga. I love the dressing offerings. I often get the Mexican goddess or the lemon tahini, tzatziki, and a squeeze of lemon or lime.   Ive also tried and liked lots of the specials - like the NYC street cart. Hope that one comes back around!   I can't go in without coming out with one of their lemonades I usually mix the unsweetened green or black tea with their  regular or raspberry lemonade for a tasty Arnold Palmer.   Also if you download the app - you can get a free meal after spending $100. Doesn't take long to add up."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Best salad place in town. Sizes are so large and so tasty! The manager at this location is excellent. This is our favorite location. Always delicious and filling."}
{"text":"OK this place is great for a healthy dinner or lunch.  They have an enormous amount of options.  They have salads already created, make your own, or pick theirs and add your own twist.  The staff is not as friendly as I would have hoped, especially for someone who's never been there-they don't offer a lot of help with the menu, and since its always packed-I felt rushed through the line.  The lack of stars is for that and for the overwhelming feeling the menu gives me-in a rushed environment.  It's a lot.  The shop is clean and laid out well.  It is east to maneuver through the line.  The have a lot of drink option to choose from, take a taste before picking out the final choice."}
{"text":"I got the African destination creole salad for $10.99 . Boy was it Spivey! I think the salads are well proportioned and a lot of options. A bit pricey for fast food but worth it. I really enjoyed it! My coworkers and I went here for lunch. I was so hungry I forgot to take a picture. It's CHOPT salad not too much to see lol ."}
{"text":"Chopt still serves the best fast casual salad in Charlotte. I usually get a Cobb salad with spicy chicken instead of regular. Service is excellent and they don't get frustrated with substitutions. Your own unique salad is encouraged. There is usually a line around lunch time, but it moves quickly."}
{"text":"If you're looking to spend $6 on a CUP of vegetarian chili that comes in a disposable paper container, you've come to the right place. You'll love it even more if you prefer the beans in your chili to have a crunch to them.   Overpriced. Not for me. I'll be sticking to CRISP."}
{"text":"So pleased that Chopt has come to Charlotte! The ingredients are fresh and the dressings are so good.  Think Chipotle but for salads... Build your salad in a assembly line then move to the chopping station.  The chopper will fine chop all of the ingredients to your desired consistency and in the final step will add the amount of salad dressing you prefer. A final toss of the salad results in an easy to eat salad with the perfect mix of ingredients in each bite! The first trip in can feel a little crazy as you are shuffled through the line, but just go where they direct you and it will all work!  Take some time before you get in line to figure out what you want to help relieve the pressure you might feel when ordering. My go to is the Mexican Cesar add avocado and black beans. Chopt - please open an uptown location!"}
{"text":"The good: Great location, tons of variety, calorie count on every single item (amazing), and you leave feeling like you had a super healthy meal. I wouldn't say the salads were overly satisfying for dinner, but good. I prefer Crisp for a heartier salad.  The one thing I just couldn't get over was how your salad was package: huge plastic pails with lids. This is 2016. Are we really serving hundreds of salads a day at his modern salad joint in a plastic pail that is tossed away. They mention something about \"a better footprint. Each bowl=five recycled bottles\" but it me felt like every person who walked through the door was tossing five bottles in the trash (and This place is busy!!). Just made me kind of sad and I decided unless they begin to serve dine in patrons their salads  in bowl options, I'll skip this place and go to Crisp who serves their salads in a reusable bowl or a to go box. Get with the times Chopt!!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time today for lunch and I really liked it . The staff was friendly and professional ,the place was clean and my salad was excellent  I will definitely go back  Thank you Jason for the suggestions!"}
{"text":"Pros:  Tons of parking since it's in a plaza.  Very friendly staff. It was my first time and they took the time to explain how they work.  Good healthy varieties.  Good for allergies since you can craft your own salad.  Good quantity. I was full after.  Fresh ingredients.  Yum!  Cons: I can't think of any besides they really only offer salads, so don't go if you want something else. But that's what the place is known for!  This is a great option for a quick and healthy lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Read about this new place on Charlotte Agenda blog. My husband and I were out driving around to find somewhere different but yet affordable to eat and decided to try it. I now feel like part of the in crowd. I ordered the chicken tinga salad and husband ordered the steakhouse salad with beets added. I liked that they chopped up his salad really fine. I thought they would do that with mine but they didn't. I asked the manager later and he said because the kale is already finely chopped, they don't need to chop the chicken tinga salad, unless the customer asks for it to be. Love the modern decor. Comfortable and cool at the same time. I like that everything is fresh and there is a board on the wall saying where everything comes from. I am really getting into the locavore food scene. Eat local, eat fresh. I just told my 15 yr old that I went here without her and now she wants to go. So I look forward to trying it again. I liked that the cucumber water was free."}
{"text":"Very good! Looking over everything it's a little overwhelming at first but after you do it once you'll get the hang of it. Everyone is super nice and thankfully patient (haha). They let me sample dressings and highly encouraged it actually. Salads are pretty big so come hungry!"}
{"text":"My favorite in Charlotte. I love their concept and would love to see if they're going to open similar in NJ. :)"}
{"text":"Dear Chopt,  I love your new location in Charlotte, but really you need to come to California already.   Tried the mobile app here at this location for the first time and was very impressed.   Salad perfect as usual.   Come to California."}
{"text":"I love Chopt I really like the way the salad just seem to taste better with all the ingredients chopped up into smaller pieces. The price can get a little up there for a salad I will admit when you start adding things extra to it. Its super healthily and the staff is really friendly when its your time at the chopping block lol. Lunch time at this particular location can get a little packed but its worth the wait. The have a lot of options and I think they change there menu every 60 to 90 days. Of course they keep their basic salad option but you get to try salads and dressings from different locations around the world."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night around 6:30 and I thought it looked packed. My girlfriend quickly corrected me as she told me \"this is nothing, sometimes the line is to the door!\" With that said, you might wonder why I gave this place 4 stars and not 5.  The reason for that is the price, $28 for 2 salads and 2 drinks is a little crazy. But other then that, the service was really good and the salads were delicious!"}
{"text":"Love the idea of this place!!!!!  There are plenty of topping options for the build-your own salad. They also have set salads that you can choose from. They were really nice about granting substitutions for pre-listed salads for free.  Overall the service of the individuals who were preparing the salads was great, they were all very patient with us first timers and had great conversations as they chopped our salad which made the experience enjoyable.   The two cons are that  (1) the cashiers had horrible attitudes, and were very inconsistent with their offerings, as on offered the person in front of me bread, but completely forgot to offer it to me. (2) the salads are a bit pricey, but hey, your paying for the experience right!!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place. I had a meeting nearby and stopped by only way to the office. I ordered the chopped chef salad and substituted all kinds of things. I think this is a salad that should be eaten at the location because some of my stuff was kinda mushy when I ate it a few hours later (and no, the dressing wasn't on it).   That being said, the flavor was great. I had the low calorie Mexican ranch dressing. It was spicy and tasty. The people working there were helpful. I will be back but will probably try something else."}
{"text":"Really cool concept restaurant ! First you walk towards the back wall and order your salad from pre-selected options or create your own creation. The attendant will place all ingredients in a bowl and walk over to a chopping station where someone else will chop the salad in front of you to the bite size of your choice. Once the Salad is chopped up, they will mix in your salad dressing. I also added grilled chicken to my salad, which they chop up as well.  I ordered the southwest salad and was very pleased. I really couldn't distinguish what I was biting into, but sure loved the random chunks of cheese and avocado! Very large servings! I couldn't finish my entire order, but it was so chopped, i don't think it would last before getting wilted in a few hours.   Seating is indoors and they they have a few tables outside too which faces a parking lot. I loved sitting outside soaking up the sun enjoying my salad. I had a Chopt employee come up to my table outside to check if i had everything I needed, which was nice since usually staff ignores you once you walk out of the building if there is no table side service.   I also ordered the lemonade light - nice compliment to the salad I ordered. Overall, I was not left hungry and glad I was able to stuff my face with healthy foods!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Chopt salads, and I much prefer to order ahead using their app. The app is great, and if you use it then your salad is ready when you arrive!  They have tons of topping options, dressings, meats, etc. The salads always taste fresh, and the portions are large.  I typically order the Cobb salad and then I sub falafel for the chicken, and I exclude the cheese and bacon. This is another reason I like Chopt - make all the modifications you like!"}
{"text":"5 star for food, 2 star for cleanliness, 2 star for service. Tables weren't wiped down nor were the seats. They dropped some chicken while weighing it, proceeded to throw it away, and didn't replace it. Maybe the other location is better? Flavors are good, a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch and immediately want to go back!  What an awesome concept. So many fresh ingredients lined up to choose from and the service was super fast! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Turned a salad into a wrap and it was the best decision I made all day! Amazing and HUGE!"}
{"text":"Dear Chopt, Do you know what it feels like to diarrhea and vomit at the same time? Do you know what it feels like to be so sick from throwing up for six hours straight that your body is weak and shaking uncontrollably because it is doing everything it can to force the bad out? After ten hours of being sick with maybe a total of two hours of terrible interrupted sleep, I woke up to a fever of 102 and I am still running to the bathroom all day today because my body is still sick from your dirty contaminated salad. I have never been so sick from food before in my life, but now I can thank CHOPT for showing me the limits of sickness that a body can endure."}
{"text":"I'm from Charleston SC, and I've been looking for a place like this since I got here a year ago.. I was soooo ecstatic!! The customer service was super!! Not to mention a very clean establishment.. I ordered the Spicy Sonoma Caesar, my tastebuds were very pleased. I would definitely return and recommend to other.. Long story short I was a happy camper!!  :)"}
{"text":"Mediocre, over-dressed salad with wilted lettuce.  Had very high hopes for this place, but was not impressed."}
{"text":"I made my own salad using a mix of arugula and spinach with customized toppings, dressing on the side.  Here's what I loved about Chopt:  1. The sheer simplicity of being able to choose multiple lettuce types inclusive of kale and arugula ...as well as all of your standard run-of-the-mill lettuce options.  2. Unique toppings such as beets & hearts of palm  3. Tons of toppings in all categories like meats, cheeses, etc. 4. Listing of the calories for dressings and other menu items 5. Expansive non-salad menu options inclusive of quinoa bowls and wraps   Less love for .... The huge amount of lettuce. After my salad was \"chopted\" I felt like I could have gotten away with a lot less lettuce but that is just a personal preference. The toppings were very generous indeed.   I really enjoyed Chopt and think it's a great addition to the Charlotte \"salad scene\" and Park Road Shopping Center! :)"}
{"text":"LOVE!! Charlotte has a handful of salad places, but none compare to Chopt. I've been in love with this place since I first ate at a Chopt years ago in nyc, and I was thrilled to hear we were getting one here. It totally lived up to my expectations, and more! The ambiance is clean and fresh. The staff is friendly, and the service is quick. The menu is great. It's not just your regular 3 or 4 types of salads that you add your favorite protein to, but at the same time it isn't overwhelming and complicated. Best of all - they chop up your salad really good - that does make a huge difference in how your salad tastes. The portions are great for the price, and oh to make things even better they source a lot of their produce locally!! Now all we need is a few more locations around town! I had their Kebab Cobb salad, while the hubs tried their New York Street Cart salad. I can't decide which one I liked better. If you love salads, try Chopt, I doubt you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Someone please tell me why I did not know this was here?! This is so up my alley! I have disappointed myself in my delay.   It is brilliant to have a healthy quick serve option and Chopt does it well. We just wanted a light and quick lunch since it was later in the afternoon and Chopt was perfect!   It is clean, everyone is helpful and friendly, and the menu has any salad option you could possibly ever want!! Not to mention I am in love with the fact that there was no soda, the utensils and to-go items were environmentally friendly, they have recycling, and food items are locally sourced! You cannot get any higher up on my list!  You just go through line, watch them prepare what you have decided to indulge in, grab your food and a nice lemonade or organic tea and sit down. There are tables out in front, too, so you can enjoy the outdoors while chowing down!   The ingredients are fresh, lettuce is crisp (and they even ensure they have \"chopt\" it to the size of your easy-to-bite liking), they do not overdress your salad with dressing (they make sure the amount is good for you), and they rotate speciality salads/bowls often keeping the spark alive.   Well no other way to end this but to say I am so thrilled to have finally seen the Chopt light!! I have even learned there are locations in most of my frequently traveled cities. Joy! I will be back and I will work my way through the menu with a smile on my face!"}
{"text":"So I don't know if it makes me basic, or a hipster, or part of Charlotte Agenda, but I freaking loved this place and want to incorporate it into my diet once a week. Is that too much to ask?   The ambiance is relatively modern and very New Yorky, except everyone there is nice and polite. The menu was surprisingly overwhelming at first, but after some help from the people behind the counter, I decided on the Santa Fe, one of the \"first time favorites\". By the by, that's a really cool thing to put on the menu, basically a default menu for the hopelessly indecisive.   The salad was prepared for me in front of me, I watched them chop it with the coolest kitchen utensil/ninja weapon ever, and then I decided how much of the dressing I wanted. Everything was custom and to my liking.   The taste was phenomenal. The fact that I knew that something that good was that little calories was phenomenal. And I can't wait to go back and try more!   Pro-tip: There is a crack between the window and the small ledge. Beware of dropping things. I dropped my ticket unfortunately and had to get one remade, which was easy enough, but I don't know what would've happened if I dropped my wallet. So..just... be careful."}
{"text":"Just want to compliment Chris at Chopt for giving great customer service.  Not only was he super polite, but he was patient and went above and beyond to make sure that we were satisfied.  It's hard to find good help these days and especially one who is willing to assist without being told!  Just a great worker with good work ethics!  Good old customer service that's long been erased!  Give that guy a raise :-)  His Mother taught him well!!!!!!!  The salads are good too!  Thanks Chris......We're not first timers and it certainly won't be our last time.....We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yes..yes..Yes!  I love this place! While the line does get long it moves quick. The options are endless and always great! The staff is friendly and accommodating! Happy that chop't came to park road!"}
{"text":"The streamlined, conveyer belt-like service made it impossible for me to order food here. For anyone with allergies I would strongly advise to avoid eating here. There were massive amounts of cross contamination that was unavoidable due to the quick pace and vicinity of the allergen ingredients to other items. I wanted an excellent salad and had to go to CO next door instead."}
{"text":"I have visited about 5 times since they have opened and loved every visit. The atmosphere and decor are very modern and clean. The staff is always helpful and go above and beyond to accommodate any allergy or food preferences. The service is fast so if you are in a hurry there is usually not to long of a wait. The menu is huge and has an option for everyone, they even let you taste the dressings if you cant decide what you want. I  highly recommend this place as a healthy and delicious food option."}
{"text":"I originally had Chop't in NYC and places like this are a dime a dozen in most other cities.  I am not surprised that there is a buzz around this place considering Charlotte doesnt offer a ton of easy, casual, healthy options. When I think of healthy, I am talking about food with integrity. No hormones or antibiotics in the meat, organic when possible, clean ingredients, fresh, etc.   The place was very clean, the menu pretty easy to follow and overall friendly service.  I decided to create my own salad. The salad was huge but I found out after the fact you can do a half order which is a nice option. I chose the mixed greens for my base and they loaded me up with all the other veggies I wanted.  The veggies/toppings are good but they didnt have a few staples like artichokes, almonds, fruit (other than dried cranberries), red onions (only some weird grilled version), red peppers, etc. I went with the grilled chicken and it was gross. Tough. Flavorless. I opted for the white balsamic vinegar and that was pretty tasty. They allowed me to try a few dressings before committing, which I appreciated considering most of them were pretty unique.    Overall, good place. Not my favorite but I would go again when I am craving a huge salad."}
{"text":"Hmm , hmm, good.     Today was my second trip to Chopt and I brought my husband for his first experience. We arrived around 10:45am Sunday. Best time to go because their was NO line. The staff greeted us as we walked in and approached the counter. Extremely friendly staff.   My husband ordered the Cobb salad and I ordered  the 7 summits with chicken.  OMG, both were delish and quite filling.   My husband really enjoyed watching the chopping part. He committed how fast the overall process was. He even committed on how friendly the staff was.   We will definitely be return customers."}
{"text":"Returned to Chopt for another visit. I will definitely be returning.  I chose to create my own salad of edamame, lettuce blend, dried cranberries, boiled eggs, pepper jack cheese, and lite balsamic vinegar dressing. I took my salad to go. I was so excited when I got home, I'm glad I went for the create my own... it was so fresh and delicious.  Service was excellent. My salad maker was friendly and speedy. The cashier was also very nice. I was in and out within a few minutes.  I'm glad I returned, as the quality and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Chopt offers a lot of style to your salad options. Many menu options for vegan, vegetarian, protein seekers, and is allergy conscious. Their portion sizes are easily enough for two meals. The roasted squash is my favorite add on item. If your looking for a lunch meeting- this is not the place it's a hustle and bustle atmosphere most people order ahead and pick it up. It's a great \"grab and go\" place, and their cucumber lemon water is complimentary. Kid friendly, and I've got to give them a shout out for sanitation. I see them cleaning after every salad- making me feel confident my food is not at risk for contamination."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They chop everything and mix your salad all together so you're not eating all the toppings with only lettuce left.  It was clean and the staff was very friendly. Will def go back."}
{"text":"Interesting Take on Salads.  They get Chopped.  I did not know what I was expecting upon walking into the business but I intrigued none-the-less.   At chop you pick a pre-selected combo of salad ingredients, (or pick your own) , pick your dressing, and then they put it all on a board and chop it all up with a big Steel Rocker.    I was impressed when i realized what was happening. I had never had a chopped salad before.  It was nice. Everything was mixed together for optimal enjoyment and favor entswining.  Park Road needed a good salad place and this fits the bill."}
{"text":"It's a good salad, large, lots of toppings, good flavor.  The price seems crazy for a salad, but they are at least large and actually filling.  Quinoa is in too many of their salads, and it's pretty nasty, I hate the texture.  Other than nasty quinoa, everything looked fresh, and tasted good.  The Chopt name is because they take all the ingredients, dump it on a plate, and use a two handled knife to chop the salad into tiny bites.  A little gimmick that mixes everything together, but after you chop salad up into tiny pieces, dream on about it not turning into a wilted mess after a couple hours.    The atmosphere is what you'd expect from a trendy salad joint...it's a trendy salad joint stuck in the shell of a mix between Five guys and Chipotle.  To quote the Simpsons \"You don't win friends with salad!\"  It's a good salad, not a bad choice if you are looking for a salad, but they are darn near the price of a firebirds entree salad.  They have tons of people working, so it explains why it was $25 for 2 of us to eat, and I had water.  I just didn't find it was that good of value."}
{"text":"I totally love the fresh concept and originality of this restaurant! I've actually never seen anything before like it. The vegan items are plentiful and clearly marked on the menu. The place looked clean and contemporary. While they have numerous beverage concoctions (brewed tea or infused waters) that were sweetened with honey, they also had equal amounts that were vegan. The calories are clearly posted and you can easily make a meal that is waist-friendly.  The reason I'm not rating it with more stars is because the ordering and pick up process is a little hectic, jumbled, and overall chaotic. The menu is also not clear about what the sandwich is. The board states that you get your choice of green with the sandwich, so I thought it was a lettuce wrap, but instead they serve the sandwich in a tortilla, but that is not stated anywhere. I was not given the bread with my salad like other posts mentioned.   Then although they appeared to be eco-friendly, you throw your trash into the same receptacle as the excessive plastic salad bowl and lid instead of separating them, so I wonder if someone really picks through the garbage to ensure that the items are actually recycled and not sent to a landfill. It was also very noisy in the restaurant.  Despite the above, I would still consider going again."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I need more locations! I love this place and would eat salads daily if there were one by my house or job! But this one is in a great location in the Park Road Shopping Center so whenever I know I'll be in the area I try to grab one or two (one for later of course). I have yet to get the same salad twice and that's not a bad thing because they have so many choices on top of the monthly specials that it's hard to not want to try something else! They make the salad in front of you so you can always say a little more or a little less of something as they are picking it in. All the ingredients are fresh and the stations look super clean no matter the time you go in. You can change up the dressing or combine two. I usually always get the salad with the spicy dressing so I just cut it with Caesar dressing and it's so good. My first time I was a little overwhelmed but they where ready for me and all my questions."}
{"text":"ER MA GAH, Chopt is so delicious. I've been surprised on many occasions by how the very long line can move so quickly. If you walk in and are worried about the line, wait it out. It will go quick!  Chopt offers so many options and toppings. I've never done the quinoa bowls, so I can't speak to those. I've only ordered salad. I love that you mix and match any of the lettuces and toppings. You can always get one of their standards blends (I recommend the Santa Fe if you like spicy, tex-mex salads).   The only reason I rate Chopt 4 Stars is that I do feel like it can be pricey. I love avocado, which is an extra $2! The Santa Fe, sans fried onions + avocado, runs around $11. The nice thing is that it does last about 1.5-2 meals!  I do highly recommend Chopt and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"$15 for salad and soda... little pricey. Do build you own and you'll have enough to take home or share."}
{"text":"Woooww very fresh veggies salad here. Nice space to bring a friends or come alone.i got a delicious salad I don't remember the name but has corn and avocado and more .lots tea and fresh lemonade    Well drop two star because the portion is not like before I come to this location since first week open and alway a good size. Since last month I started realized is gets small. We eats here once or twice a week . The food is good but I think since we get a smaller size salad the price is too much"}
{"text":"Amazing place!! But you can never find a seat. Soooo many people come here it's unreal. I had the chicken Tinga bowl my first time. Absolutely delicious!! Unfortunately they are getting stingy with the portions and they seem to be getting smaller, except the salads which are big. The platters are awfully small for the huge price you pay. Overall good but very expensive place for a salad.  All the ingredients are super fresh, the decor is clean looking and welcoming, the staff is very friendly but the quality of food is the best. recommend it"}
{"text":"Ultra friendly service with a good variety of salads. I did arrive before the lunch hour, and everybody was super patient, while I figured out the menu. Menu is not difficult, I just wanted to read all my options. I bookmarked restaurant and will be back."}
{"text":"So good!!! Never disappoints. Thought it would be a boring salad place and was reluctant to go but honestly now I crave it."}
{"text":"These salads are always delicious!!! The only downfall is the OUTRAGEOUS prices. I payed over $12 for just a salad. No drink or anything. The line is always long but the staff could be a little friendlier and more helpful when answering questions. They don't have good customer service."}
{"text":"Went in at lunch. The ordering system is very chaotic because they rook you to the back to start but you have to get past all the people nearer the front waiting to pay. It was very crowded but as I waited the server recognized the guy behind me & started waiting on him. As I continued to wait to be helped the other servers were tidying the salad components & no one offered to help or acknowledge me. I finally left.  Will probably not go back:( I gave it 2 stars because the food did look interesting but who knows."}
{"text":"Salad should not be a side to your lunch! Chopt is making hearty, healthy and delicious salads.   Chopt is so fun. The counter is walk-up--and you'll have the option of building your own salad (with A TON of tasty ingredients!) or picking one of the salads they already have designed. I recommend taking a second before getting in line to really read through the menu. The first time you go, it can be a little overwhelming because it's so fast-paced.   Once you choose your salad they'll throw everything in to a bowl and move you down to the \"choppers\". Those are the employees literally chopping up all the ingredients and mixing in the dressing. You do not have to have the assigned dressing for pre-designed salads--feel free to mix it up!  Right now they have a destination menu--try the New Orleans Creole Shrimp, it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great salads.  Great grain salads.  Did I say GREAT!  Located in the Blakeney Shopping Center.  Great staff, clean, inviting, organized.  The Spa Tex Mex Ranch dressing is fab.  The Spa Cucumber Water and the Sweet Tea sweetened with honey is fab.  Pricing very reasonable.  Sit outside.  Enjoy your lunch or dinner.   So glad you made your way to Blakeney.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Chopt has been changing the way Charlotte eats lunch and as they keep opening locations they  get the chance to reach more and more people.   this is a beautiful space, convenient and well thought out. I hope they do well and I will be there tomorrow to help welcome them."}
{"text":"Wonderful salad options chopped for reasonable price. Had the chicken tinga, would not have thought of quinua with a warm kale chopped salad but probably the best chopped kale salad I've ever had."}
{"text":"I heart a good salad, so was excited to try Chopt out!  A little hectic during the dinner crowd, but there was a floor Chopt dude helping guide those of us who were lost and to hand out menus.  The line moved quickly and the staff there is really friendly with a positive vibe!  Pretty straight forward once you figure out what you want.  I ordered the Braised Greek and grabbed some organic sweet tea. The final results were delish!  My chopper initially forgot to add the quinoa mix or chicken, but when I caught it she was very sweet and apologetic, and promptly fixed it.  It would have been such a sad meal without it.   Yummy place, and I will definitely be back!  I'll just be checking my salads with a critical eye while they work the kinks out :)"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! Excellent salad choices. You can choose between salad creations on the menu or make your own. I always leave full, as their portions are great. The food is fresh. So many places skimp on the protein on the salad, but Chopt is generous with their protein servings. Line is usually long, but moves quickly. I like that they use a fresh chopping board and fresh knife with every salad so there is not cross-contamination. Their iced tea selection is also excellent and they have stevia. I visit this place at least once a week."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars because once the novelty of it's concept and presentation wears off, you will come to the realization that you are paying $8 to $10 for what amounts to a $4 to $5 salad.  Do yourself a favor and go to Firehouse subs and get a better chopped salad for $3 less."}
{"text":"*IF YOU ARE A REGIONAL MANAGER, PLEASE READ* The two stars are only because of how good the salads are, but that's the point of a food establishment, so maybe I'll go with 1.5 stars. I've been to this location 4 times since it opened, and there were various problems every time (used wrong dressing, small things like that. It's clear that many of the employees have not been trained well, through no fault of their own. I sincerely hope a regional manager sees this; the mangers at this location are either lazy, clueless, apathetic, or careless. Today was the day I decided that I at least wanted to get my voice out there. There were three women in front of me, and four behind me. There was one employee putting the salads together, and one chopping and at the cash register at the same time. If I knew the names of these two, I would commend them on their excellent service and attitudes. The girl had never chopped a salad there, but she jumped in to help and she did a great job. At this point, it had already been 7 minutes bc two women in front changed their minds and decided to get wraps. That's fair, indecisive customers are to be expected. The manager was interviewing a guy literally looking STRAIGHT AHEAD at the now 8 person long line. Didn't blink an eye. I have been a host, a server, a bartender, and in retail for over 6 years. Every time I've interviewed at restaurants, the manager had to get up for a minute or two to help out the employees of it got busy. A woman in the back of the line went up to that manager and told her how unprofessionally this was going, and, reluctantly, the manager got up by the cash register. We also noticed (us in line were griping together- again not at the two working, they were great) another manager get up from sitting in the back to run the other register and clearly she was not happy about it. I know she could have been on break, but as a manager, her job is to MANAGE situations like this. Honestly, the four people behind me should not have even been charged. It was a 15 minute situation. These managers need to get their acts together and understand their job is to train employees well, manage the place (its literally their job title), and care about service. Again, I've been in customer service for a long time, and I've witnessed the good the bad and the ugly. This was both bad and made ugly by the unprofessional managers. Regional managers should check this out."}
{"text":"Came on opening day didn't have the place yet on yelp went yesterday and was still as good as opening day they don't have a soda machine which is great they have other choices like thier raspberry hibiscus tea which is unsweet but delicious"}
{"text":"Love the new Chopt at Park Rd Shopping center! So many wonderful and healthy add in's for your salad, and the dressing flavors are amazing!  If I could change anything, it would be more time to decide everything to put on a salad!"}
{"text":"Doors were opened and i was treated with respect and kindness. There's alot to choose from but the friendly staff helps to make it easier. I adore this place. The chopper was extremely charming and the place itself had a nice welcoming feeling. My salad of choice is the Mexicali vegan..... I chose I spicy asian dressing but added hot pepper sauce. A win!"}
{"text":"Why haven't I been here sooner?!?  I was out running errands on a weeknight and found myself in the vicinity and decided to try it.    First impressions... I am a big fan of Park Rd Shopping center and it's recent face lift of all the storefronts.  There's a lot going on in that shopping center as far as construction and changes - still is a little hard to maneuver due to the 'choice' folks that decide its a great idea to create their own traffic flow.  But I digress.  Chopt is \"sandwiched\" (see what I did there... okay... not that funny) between the big players Rite Aid and Harris Teeter.  It's got some outdoor tables and fairly large indoor dining space.  Tables can be pushed together for large groups.  There are booths too.  The interior is very modern and I'm a fan of the large spice art on the wall.  I don't know if the spices & sauces on the wall are linked to geographic locations where they first originated, but I'll keep staring at it until I figure it out.  Navigate your way through the dining space toward the back where the line starts... AND THERE WILL BE A LINE (just to forewarn you).  I may start coming at an off peak meal time.  Don't get me wrong, the line does move, but I would rather be eating my salad than listening to the person behind me complain about how too many boys are liking her at the moment.  There are a couple of pre-set salads you can choose from, but the ability to customize your salad is probably the way to go here.  I was a noob, so I tried the Mexican Caesar Salad (appears on their \"first time favorites\" section of the menu).  Seems like one person starts your \"base\" as far as the greens and major salad components... then you are shuffled over to a chopping station (1-4) where you wait in line again to talk to your salad finisher.  This is where you add the dressing - \"say when\" and the chopper uses what I would call a sling blade (but it's not really) to chop your salad to whatever consistency you would like.  Once your salad is ready, they scrape it all back into the container and you go wait in the register line to pay for your salad and any other drinks you would like... you can get bread at this step too, but I declined.  I don't even want to see this place during peak lunch/dinner time... it must be crazy... I definitely like this place a lot better than the salad place (similar concept) in Chicago I recently tried since there is WAY LESS yelling... could be the reason why the line doesn't move as fast, but I'd rather keep my nerves and eardrums in check and have a small wait versus the alternative."}
{"text":"When I heard this restaurant was opening I did my research first and discovered they are a chain and this was their first Charlotte location. So being that I'd rather support locally owned businesses I was reluctant to try this place.  What brought me in here is I was looking for something to take home after running an errand and didn't want the usual sandwich or fast food places.  They have printed menus near the door so I'd recommend picking one up so you can peruse while you are standing in line. The line starts at the back of the restaurant. Someone takes your order and they had you a sheet. That person gathers all the ingredients in your order and then passes them on to someone down the line who chops your lettuce and mixes everything in your salad. Then it's stuffed in a clear plastic bowl in a rather unappetizing way. Then on you go to pay and get your drink.  Like one other reviewer mentioned it's a rather chaotic process. Seems a bit disorganized at times and it's very loud in there so you can barely hear the person making your salad.    For my salad, I went with one of the First timer recommendations - the Santa Fe salad which comes with Avocado, grape tomatoes, corn, pepperjack, fried onions and romaine. It sounded appetizing but what I received was not. It looked and tasted like a lot of mush. The high point was the spicy Chipotle vinagrette.     I can't say if I will come back or not, especially when there's a locally owned salad place up the street. But who knows, I may end up here again for the convenience to try something beyond the first timer recommendations."}
{"text":"OK salad, but don't bother coming here around lunch unless you have an hour to spare. I usually order whatever the destination salad is but on multiple occasions I've gotten to the front only to be told they were out of the ingredients to make it."}
{"text":"This place takes salads to the next level. I decided to indulge in this little spot one day for lunch... Bad idea! It was super busy and if you're new to this salad making concept, it can be a bit overwhelming, yet fun! Plus, any new featured salads are offered as samples to those waiting in line.   I tried the Sante Fe Chicken Salad. Once you've placed your order you then follow the person behind the counter that walks your bowl of ingredients to the \"chop\" station. Needless to say, it was organized chaos because there isn't much distinction between one line and the next.   At checkout, the cashier was very friendly. However, I wasn't too sold on the total price coming to almost $18 for just a salad and a drink. The size of the salad was plentiful, but I can't wholeheartedly say it was the best I've had."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. The Texas po boy is always my go to. Highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I love Chopt! A great salad bar with fresh ingredients. I also love that they....chop the salad. Right? Great healthy spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty palm salad but my hearts o Palm pieces were a bit tough. I suppose it's good for the fiber? Ingredients are crunchy and fresh. U can order a menu salad or a mix of what u crave. Agave is used instead of sugar in their dressing which makes for a healthy meal...no crashing after an hour! There's a Chopt app u can download b4 eating here. Don't know the details but I'm sure it must b to the customers' benefit. I'm sure to come here again. Only peeve is that each extra selection is 79¢ more n I so wanted a sprinkle of corn and a boiled egg but my salad was already $8.97 but so worth the freshness. I usually go to Moe's but this is a step up in freshness. Wish we had a Chopt in Waxhaw!  12/08/16 Spicy Cashew Soba Noodle: was hoping for cashews as the name implies but I guess it's in the sauce. Had to try it n now I recommend if u try it to hv more sauce added than usual because I did n it wasn't enough. I recommend that Chopt top whole or chunks of cashews. Love the edamame but I don't think I'll order this again, rather I'll order it without the soba noodles n add arugula for that nutty taste"}
