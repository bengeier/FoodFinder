{"text":"Walk in the door and you feel at home.  The food was to die for.  This place has the freshest ingredients coupled with creative dishes.  I would even  recommend families come because even my 11 year old soon enjoyed the whole experience.  I thank the cook, the staff and all the farmers who helped to create this true dining masterpiece."}
{"text":"We landed here on New Year's Day when they were serving a buffet. Food was fairly good but service was very confused and disorganized. Staff seemed to be all foreign students who didn't really know what was going on. I'd give it a second try when it isn't a holiday to see if it runs more smoothly."}
{"text":"Family run and family friendly cafe and restaurant. 
Hospitable and welcoming host, server and cook. 
Relaxing and warm ambiance.
Enjoyed the Veggie Casserole, Chicken and Avocado crepe (mouth watering delicious- seriously! ). 
Will fill your tummy without hurting your tummy (or your wallet!)
Can't wait to go back and try their desserts! 
I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Strong unknown smell greated us as we entered which should have put us on alert. Hot and hungery we sat down for lunch, anyway. Mistake!!!!! The absolute worst food we have eaten. Nothing authentic, the crepes were dry and tasteless as if preprocessed. Avoid."}
{"text":"Popped into this café looking for a simple lunch. That was a mistake. The food took forever to arrive (in part because they forgot about my sandwich order). When I did get the food it was particularly unappetizing. The chicken looked like it was coated in gelatin...not sure why and the glaze was in the outside making it hard to eat. My friend's crepe came to the table cold with chicken in a similarly sad state. Don't be fooled by the quaint interior!"}
{"text":"Was a rainy day in Montreal, we were cold, hungry & wet. 1 hour later we were just happy to be back in the rain... Seriously. To top it off, the prices are high. A mistake we'll only make once..."}
{"text":"It was ok. We got the chicken, avocado and cheddar crêpe and a date square. The crêpe had more veggies than anything but it was decent. The date square was pretty good.

Looks like they have a few gluten free items, but if you're gluten free for clinical reasons I'd be suspect since they make it all in the same place."}
{"text":"We had a Greek salad. Not the worst thing I've ever had, but certainly nothing to write home about. It was fairly small, and largely composed of onions...

Our order was forgotten twice, though, and we spent a long time sweating at the table without water."}
{"text":"Great place in Old Montreal.  It seemed authentic vs. a chain restaurant. All organic, natural, all that good stuff. Lots of options for dietary restricters, vegans and vegs.

I had a tuna salad which totally hit the spot. Fresh and delicious, I wanted to eat two. Just what I was looking for. Paired with some lovely mint tea, I felt healthier after eating it. 

Looked like they had a lot of options for lunches and dinners, I'd return on another fun trip to the gorgeous city of Montreal."}
{"text":"This place looks so cute from the outside, so we popped in for breakfast. 

It's messy in an unsettling way. Looks like all the furniture and decor was purchased from Kijiji, but not really in a good way.

The service was super slow, and the food wasn't great. I had a vegetarian omelette, and my husband had the cheese omelette. Mine tasted a little bit like feet.

The coffees are good, and this is a great place to people watch. The baked goods looked awesome, if we were to go back we would probably just get some of their bakery fare to go."}
{"text":"Mauvais service. J'ai commandé un sandwich et ils l'ont donné à un autre client. Le client est donc revenu au comptoir pour spécifier que ce n'était pas ce qu'il avait commandé. On m'a donc rendu mon sandwich sans sourire ni excuse. J'ai aussi demandé un reçu détaillé et on m'a dit qu'ils ne savaient pas ce que c'était. Après leur avoir expliqué, la serveuse s'est retournée nonchalamment et a agrippé la facture d'un autre client pour me la donner, me disant: \"voilà un reçu détaillé.\" Alors si vous voulez bien manger et avoir une expérience agréable, don't go there!"}
{"text":"Stopped here as this was a cafe and not a full sit down restaurant to grab a quick bite. 

I knew that it was going to be a little pricey given the area, but I was very unimpressed by the price one my food came. I ordered a $16 crepe with egg, avocado, and cheese.

It took over 20 minutes for the crepe to be prepared. When it finally was, I asked for it to go, as we had reservations somewhere else. I took a bite and the crepe itself was cold, which means it had been sitting out awhile. The avocado was actually guacamole, and I don't know where the cheese was.

Will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Quaint and cozy are the best words to describe this cafe. It was a rainy day in Montreal and we decided to duck into the nearest restaurant/cafe for lunch. Luckily, this place was  it! We ordered the avocado salad which was amazing, especially the small bread that came with it (I'm guessing it's the 7 grains bread). Service was a little slow, but perfect for our lazy day."}
{"text":"Walking around in Montreal, this might not be the perfect place for lunch but the food will surprise you.  It just has sandwiches, pizzas and crepe. But it is good."}
{"text":"Shockingly awful service and the owner was EXTREMELY rude to me and my boyfriend! We walked in to look at the menu and use the restroom and left with him screaming at us for no reason! Im appalled by his behaviour and would NOT recommend his disgusting excuse of a cafe to anyone!"}
{"text":"I must say, I have never left a bad review for anywhere in my life but my experience at this café was horrifying. The most notable problem is the astonishingly bad customer service. The woman taking orders was incredibly rude and put her hand up when I tried asking her a simple question about seating. I work in a restaurant too so I understand how stressful it can be when you're busy and customers are trying to ask you things, however; it was not busy and I was being very polite. I ordered a \"hummus and avocado vegetarian casserole\" and got a plate of peas and potatoes and a piece of bread with no avocado or hummus. I also ordered an iced coffee and got a hot one instead. Normally I wouldn't have complained about this, but it was pretty hot outside. When I told her about the mistake she gave me a plastic cup of ice and a huge attitude. Not to mention, this place is pretty pricey."}
{"text":"We ordered the Vegetable Crepe to share. Rather than vegetables and feta as described, which we assumed would be on the inside of the crepe, it was something very different. The crepe itself was a large, cold, spongy and I think buckwheat--not the thin, delicate French style crepe we were expecting. The feta was piled on top and had been burnt under a broiler (it was black and inedible). The only vegetable pieces were tomatoes and olives. There were three mounds of spreads on top of the crepe, which we hadn't asked for, were not in the menu description and which made the crepe underneath soggy and inedible: guacamole, hummus and tzatziki. So it's a Middle Eastern/Mexican crepe and should be described as such on the menu, with the unusal crepe described as well. My friend didn't like it at all, though I thought the tzatziki and hummus were fantastic. Just not at all what we'd ordered. The people who worked there seemed very friendly and hard-working."}
{"text":"Overpriced, terrible service, awful food. This statement is overly kind for such a place. I warned my wife when we walked in, but she insisted. This was the only place near our hotel that was serving brunch after 11:30am. From the dirty curtains hanging in the doorway, to the disorganized and tacky decor; there is nothing inviting or charming about this place. The owner should be ashamed to run such a place. Complete tourist trap."}
