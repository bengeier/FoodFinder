{"text":"This is my favorite place in the OCAD foodcourt, and easily the most popular place with long lineup everyday. Food is very cheap for its quality.   I love the sweet and sour chicken especially. Most dishes tasted like Chinese food, except they also offer cook-to-order Thai specialty food (e.g. pai thai)."}
{"text":"Their food is always incredibly DELICIOUS. The lady who works there is the nicest person u will find working in the Grange Village. Their prices are very reasonable with the quality of food they make."}
{"text":"My husband got food poisoning from this place.  He had diarrhea and vomiting so many times, and he lost a lot of fluid. He couldn't get up from the bed. His fever was 39 celcius. Doctor said it's food poisoning. This lasted 4 days.  This is how we narrowed it down to Thai Bright: For the past week, my mom, myself and my husband have been eating the same food, except that my husband had Thai Bright. My mom and I are fine, but my husband (the only one who ate thai bright) got food poisoning."}
{"text":"The lunch specials here are only $5!   Where do you find anything for $5 for a full box of food these days?   Don't come here with high expectations as this is food court food, It's a student area, so value and portion size will be what you're getting.   Thai Bright as a great selection of hot table items.  I usually get the Singapore vermicelli as my carb side and either the mixed vegetables (which comes with tofu) or the green beans along with a meat choice of either bourbon chicken or spicy chicken.  The food is usually served hot as their are usually so many customers lining up that the cooks refill the table items very often, so your $5 combo will come piping hot.  However, I do find some items to be to a bit too salty.  Either way, if you want a cheap and fast lunch, you can't go wrong with Thai Bright."}
{"text":"This is in a food court so it going to be value oriented.  Good serving size for the price.  I had about 6-8 shrimp in my Shrimp Pad Thai.  Service was fast. I asked for medium heat so I could focus on the flavour and it was on the bland side... I didn't taste the tamarind and the Shrimp were just there... none of that natural sweetness you normally find... so it need some help from seasoning but sadly there was no supporting cast to help fix this ensemble. Perhaps this is because it's the end of a long day and not everything is as fresh as it was earlier in the day... including the cook and the server.  :)"}
{"text":"- the food here is DELICIOUS- their eggplant is to die for. However, the staff are very unfriendly and gave me a hard time about not wanting noodles with my combo- told me not to expect a lot of food because noodles are cheaper? Gee thanks. As good as the food is, unimpressed with their service!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the $5 lunch special at this place. Soooo good and great value. I always get the eggplant and the yellow curry but the meat dishes look good too"}
{"text":"Expectations for food court restaurants are usually pretty low, and often times for good reason. The food has been sitting around for too long and isn't fresh and the prices for what you get are often a bit out of whack.  This is not the case however at Thai Bright. Located in the food court of Village By The Grange, this always busy food counter offers up fresh and tasty Thai and Pan Asian cuisine at very reasonable prices. For starters, at lunch which is their busiest time, they offer a special for noodles or rice plus one meat plus veggies for $5. That's amongst the best deals you can get for lunch in the downtown area. If you prefer to go for something off the buffet style food available, the Pad Thai or Pad Sew are both tasty and generous in quantity, and are made to order for under $9. Drinks are pretty standard prices, appetizers are as well. If you ask, they offer samples for you to try and see what you'd like (at least in my experiences).  The staff has remained the same during the entire time it has been open and are very friendly and professional, no mater how busy they are. They also have good memories as they remembered what My regular order was after only a few visits.   Lunch done quick and right for $5. Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"For food court quality, this place exceeded my expectations.  Thai Bright is located inside the Village by the Grange food court, and is probably one of the most popular stalls there during lunch. They have your usual Chinese fast food selections (think Manchu Wok), but they also offer Thai food such as Pad Thai and Pad Sew, hence why it's called Thai Bright!  I wasn't interested in the Manchu Wok-style combo offerings (although for $5 they are cheap!), so I went with the pad thai instead. They make the pad thai separate from the food offerings, so you know it's fresh. For ~$7.50, the food quality is excellent, in fact I can say it's up to par to places like Thai on Yonge, Thai Country Kitchen, etc. They certainly do not use ketchup on their noodles, as I felt that tamarind sauce feel while eating.  Will definitely dine here again if I'm in the food court!"}
{"text":"Checked this food court stall out based on prior reviews. This is not really true Thai food, and I suspect it's run by Chinese as there were Chinese dishes in their food window. I ordered the chicken pad thai, and unfortunately it was soupy and ketchupy, the noodles were too soft, and worst of all there bits of chicken skin and chicken fat in it along with a minute amount of chicken meat which was overtenderized to that mushy gummy texture. You can get much better pad Thai for a couple dollars more elsewhere!"}
