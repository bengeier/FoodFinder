{"text":"Hands down best breakfast around. And the service is phenomenal. It's like being at home with family here! The berry crepes are airy and trust me... they load em up! Classic eggs Benny is outrageous with those tarragon biscuts :)   Don't even get me started on the cappucino. Last time I had one that smooth and bold was in Jersey...6 years ago.   And if you get the burrito load it up with fresh veggies and bacon! That's the only way to do it :D"}
{"text":"We yelped \"brunch\" and found this cute little place. After reading the reviews we decided to try it. (Plus I thought we'd hit everything in the neighborhood.) It's very small but quaint. The food was great, service was great and the portion size was perfect. Not too much, not too little. It seemed most stuff was ala carte so if you would like potatos just ask for a side. They also have a bakery case with tasty looking goodies and they cater. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience.  Only 7 tables inside and out. Tiny restaurant. At first it looked like a local gem. We sat at a table for two & 4 other tables already had their food. No one else was there. We ordered a big breakfast & had about an hour before we needed to be somewhere. 30 min later we still didn't have our breakfast & a few more groups had been seated while we were waiting. Another couple, who got there 20 min after we did, got their food. When we asked our waiter, he admitted that they had forgotten our order. Um, we were the ONLY ones ordering at the time. How was that possible? The owner/mgr had been schmoozing a couple at the other table but didn't notice we still didn't have our food. When our food finally came out, about 40 min later, they had the order wrong for part of it. The owner/mgr was unapologetic but offered to recook that part of our meal. We'd already waited 40 min & were short on time & said no. They comp'd the incorrect order but clearly had not planned on any mea culpa for completely forgetting our order. Won't go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of those wonderful little hole-in-the-wall places that you could drive past every day and not notice, but once you give it a try, you'll be back on a regular basis!  All of the menu items I've tried have been delicious, and I doubt there are many eggs benedicts out there that could top the ones here!    The only downfall with a small location like this is when it's busy and there isn't enough seating.  But if you're not in a hurry, the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast I have ever had. Try everything! I come all the way from Chandler to eat here!! Thanks for the friendly staff as well :)"}
{"text":"Had the 1/2 sandwich and soup. The soup was good, just not hot enough. The sandwiches were a joke. My wife had the vegie: grilled red pepper, raw red onion, raw zucchini, lettuce and tomato. Supposed to come with muenster cheese, they must have forgotten. My sandwich was the albacore tuna, okay, just didn't taste any of the other ingredients, like the water chestnuts.. The bread was super small sized, making for a small sandwich. The owner and the counter person didn't really seem to care about attempting customer service. Maybe the cafe is an afterthought to the catering business."}
{"text":"Guys, I'm so confused. The reviews are so awesome but the food was not . We got the challah French toast. It was dry and they didn't Give us any syrup. (Got all of this to go). The eggs Benedict was good. And the waffle was the best out of all 3. It is actually the only thing worth coming back for, but not enough for the price. Also, expect to get your food to-go because there is no room to sit."}
{"text":"G'aaaaargh! Fer many times I've stumbl'd into this shack fer pluderin'. Alas, I've never had such a stomach t'harm such graceful folks. Their provisions are plentiful, nuff t'share with your chosen wench. Switch your patch to yer other eye to subdue such shock at the prices. Yer pouch'll be barely lightn'd by these plates. Yer ears'll even be treated to timely choruses by Passion Pit, M83, Phoenix and all the like. Don't be frightn'd to take yer wee ones and no need here to dress in the type of gleaming fine'ry reserved fer yer most faithful cap'n. Reg'lar threads will serve prop'ly."}
{"text":"Sorry PAM (owner) but your place was terrible!!! My daughter had a so called cheese omelet (tiny tiny tiny tiny), it looked like something I was served on an airplane. The omelet consisted of one egg, maybe just maybe two very small eggs, paper thin deli ham (2 slices) little bit of finely shredded cheese, no toast, and a small side of dried out potatoes BTW the omelet was served on a plastic plate. To add insult they charged $7.95 for this. I had a egg and bacon breakfast burrito again very small, it was OK. Having read some of the other reviews me thinks that they are a sham by friends and relatives. This place is the worst!!!!"}
{"text":"What a treat to stumble upon. Tiny but mighty spot and I could not eat all the yummy offerings I found to choose from.  Benedict a couple ways our choice and filling.  Absolutely do not drive by without stopping for a delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've tried to forget about my experience at Benedict's, but every time I drive by I am reminded of the experience. We decided to try Benedict's for Father's Day this summer, the reviews were good, it looked cute and it's near our house. We walked in, no lines, but tables were occupied so we happily waited a bit. The staff sat our group of 3 at a table the size of my nightstand, I was a little concerned, but figured they knew what they were doing. They took our drink order and brought them out, no problem.   The issue came when they delivered our plates. The table may have been able to accommodate 2 regular size plates, but not three. We had to strategically place the plates on the table so we could eat, mine was hanging a little of the table to make room for my son's plate and our cups/mugs and glasses. I took a bite of the Arizona Benedict, it was quite good. I went to cut another size and the entire plate upended into my lap and purse. I shrieked, loud enough to catch the attention of the rest of the diners, but not the staff working. I had to get up find napkins, clean everything up. After waiting for several minutes for someone to come ask what happened, I finally flagged the waiter down and told him what had occurred, his reaction, he shrugged. My husband is boiling at this point. I finally get up and have to ask for the check. The young woman asked me about the meal, at which point I had to tell her what happened. She took my meal off my bill, but by this time I was incredibly frustrated by the entire experience."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast burrito with bacon and it was wonderful.  Service was cheerful and attentive.  Small, quaint place- a rare find!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that this place has gone downhill. The service is extremely slow and the reception is poor. The people there are not friendly and the environment is not inviting. It has always been way over priced, but was overlooked because the friendly staff and nice environment, but since that has been removed, it's just another sub par over priced breakfast joint. Go somewhere else. It really is a shame."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I would highly recommend this for a catering event, I had a small party at my house with around 30 people and I needed brunch. The food was absolutely amazing and they worked with us so well to tailor everything to specifically what I wanted. I live nearby so we just picked it up at a designated time. Definitely would go back & recommend them!"}
{"text":"Even though it is small, the food is outstanding. I tried the Eggs Benedict and my husband had the Omelet, and they were great. Cannot wait to try the other stuffs on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The waffle is amazing and my friend has the chorizo scramble which apparently was equally amazing. Plus everyone here is super nice. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Just brought home food and loved every bite. I have eaten here a few times, the first I forgot my glasses and was struggling  to read menu. The owner took her glasses off her head for me to use. Today I had my dog along for the ride and waitress brought him water and treated me as a dine in table instead of take out. Excellent customer service, well above and beyond!  The food is cafe style, more specialized and amazing. If u r looking for a Denny's that gives u 5 items than go to Denny's. the eggs Benedict and omelet came w potatoes and r 2 die for. Not sure why someone would say the creeps were nothing special. I prefer these since they r light full of fresh fruit the raspberry sauce is fresh and crisp and they r perfect for summer. I have a new fave! Yes there r only 2 with no sides but that's sufficient. Why does anyone who is health conscience need 3+ sides? (Samantha)  This place is small, cozy, not the mainstream Denny's style with excellent food. Love it and u will to unless The cruddy chain places is ur idea of great food!"}
{"text":"I liked the food. I ordered the food and ate the food and it was good food. I had egg on my face. Because I ordered eggs. Mmmm eggs. I like eggs when they are warm. Cold eggs make me grossed out to the max. This place restored my faith in not being grossed out to the max. Thanks guys for tasty food I could put in my face."}
{"text":"This little gem needs more stars! Sweet sweet Benedicts makes my weekend mornings with their delicious burritos - vegi, bacon, sausage or ham - it doesn't matter because they're all so good. It's a tough call between their homemade salsa or pesto as your side. Oh and order the Mexican coffee.   From the cute cook in the back to the checkout ladies, everyone is always in a good mood."}
{"text":"Cute, cozy breakfast/brunch spot. Great food."}
{"text":"Cute little brunch spot. I've gotten the Arizona Benedict both times - flavorful with a great contrast of crunchy/soft textures and a bomb green chile sauce. My boyfriend has gotten the berry crepes, the lox benedict, and the croque monsieur, all quite good as well. The outdoor seating right next to a gas station, which is less than ideal, but the great food and friendly service more than make up for it. Plus, the prices are super reasonable. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So glad to have finally stopped in, as we live just blocks away and I drive by daily but had yet to try it (until this weekend - both Saturday AND Sunday!) My husband and I were greeted both mornings and helped immediately, there was 1 person maybe 2 in front of us in line, but it moved quickly and we ordered to-go items and were back on the road within minutes of ordering. The day prior we dined-in and ate at the cafe - the food was out in less than 5-10 minutes after ordering and was SO delicious and fresh. The woman behind the counter even brought out a freshly cooked treat for our pups that were allowed in the outdoor seating area. I am sad the cafe part is only open on weekends because it's my new favorite place & I'd go every single morning if they were open 7 days a week (They cater during weekdays)!!!"}
{"text":"Best ever breakfast sandwich.  Perfectly cooked egg (slightly runny), crisp bacon, avocado, greens.  Melted in my mouth.  Son had the apple oatmeal and said t was best ever.  Small place but some seating inside and outside.  8n a little nondescript strip mall."}
{"text":"Only open for breakfast to the public on Saturdays and Sunday's, otherwise they are open for catering events during the week. GO here on the weekend, this place is amazing! The food is fresh and not greasy, which is hard to come by when going out for breakfast. A cute, local spot. They also have great pastries and coffee. If I ever need to cater, this is where I will go."}
{"text":"What a wonderfully charming cafe. Everything from start to finish is spot on. They have friendly and knowledgeable staff that make you feel like your at the true local hangout it is. When you finally decide what mouth watering thing to order and it all comes to the table, your mouth will drop with how amazing it looks and how even more incredible it tastes. Every time I come I look at surrounding tables in envy of every order. Truly a jem."}
{"text":"Food was good.  I got a Bacon and cheddar omelet.  It was descent but not excellent.  Your paying for the small cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"First, this place is tiny but man was it cute.  We arrived just in time and grabbed one of the larger tables for our party of 5.  There was a party of 6 outside and all the small tables were taken up so this place was happening.  The employees were super nice and they are pet friendly as well.  As for the service, one of the members from our party didn't receive their food with the rest of us so they brought him out a little treat to keep him happy.  The crepes, three cheese omelet, the Benedict's benedict, Arizona benedict, and lox benedict were very tasty.  Overall, the portions were small, the prices were on the high side, but presentation and taste was great."}
{"text":"While I have been to Benedict's for breakfast - which is very good - this review is for their catering service.  I used them to cater breakfast and lunch for a business meeting and could not have been more pleased with the service and food.  I even had a last minute change which they accommodated with no issues.  The food was outstanding!  Service was right on time.  100% recommend them for your catering needs!"}
{"text":"Benedict's is a tiny neighborhood place open for breakfast and lunch. They have about 4 little tables inside and the same outside in front.  We were hungry after a morning hike and waited about 5 min for a table. We each ordered an omelet. The service was friendly, but the wait for our food was very long. The kitchen staff obviously couldn't keep up the Sunday we were there. Our server brought us a slice of delicious coffee cake while we waited which was a nice gesture.  The omelets were good, but we felt were overpriced at $9.  We took advantage of their yelp deal which made it a better value.  I'd like to try Benedict's again on a weekday when it's hopefully not as busy."}
{"text":"Came here because of the groupon. Very small. Only like three tables inside. They egg sandwich was dry and just okay. Priced way too high for what you get. I would not be back nor recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to do this review since we went but needed the time to gather my thoughts correctly.   I was SO excited to have breakfast at Benedict's, I had been reading their reviews on yelp and looking into their menu.   My husband and I went  and when we arrived we noticed that it was a very small place but cute. It took VERY long to be served.  The food was VERY over priced for what we were served and the Service was terrible.  I ordered the crepes there were two crepes filled with berries, they were okay but nothing special for like 8 or 9 bucks, because the crepes didn't come with anything I also ordered eggs and their signature Biscuits. Their biscuits are the only thing I would go back for, YUMMY(only reason it got 2 starts one for the biscuit ).  My husband who will almost eat anything ordered  a salad that had tuna salad chicken salad and egg salad, he barely ate any of it,he said there was not much flavor.   We also went to Benedict's because of their pictures of their full pastry case and I have a LARGE sweet tooth, when we went there was NOTHING in the case besides cans of Soda.   I was really disappointed with our experience and do not plan on going back."}
{"text":"A local favorite, excellent food, excellent service.  Can't go wrong, love the bacon breakfast burrito and a cup of French Roast coffee."}
{"text":"Benedict's is a charming, local cafe that is both welcoming and intimate. I came with my boyfriend and were greeted by Barbara and dawn as if we were regular customers. The croissant sandwich and Barbara omelette were both delicious and perfectly portioned. We will definitely be coming back and urge everyone to visit, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great place to have a ice tea and great food.  Super neighborhood cafe.  So convenient to just pick up lunch or stay and chat.  I love it and the staff is super friendly and helpful. You just might find other businesses in the center equally friendly and neighborly.  Who would of thought."}
{"text":"Who runs out of breakfast on a Sunday morning! This place, apparently.  Not the first time this has happened.  To Butterfields I go.. definitely a better place."}
{"text":"Adorable cafe that is a hidden gem off 56th and Bell.   The food is delicious and the cafe is precious.  There is lady that works during  brunch on Sunday who is personable,  entertaining and remembered what we had ordered from our previous visit.  Think her name is Barbara.  Loved the cafe so much- that I am now using them to cater all of my company events."}
{"text":"Overall experience was bad.. I was so disappointed. Paid $11 for Benedict and there is no green comes with the Benedict and over priced regular coffee. They never came to check whether we need to refill our coffee too.   Furthermore, the old lady at the counter did not appear friendly. She did not even smile when we walked into the cafe. It gave me the feeling that we were not welcomed.   I'm not going back there again. I will rather go yo Rustic Cafe (few miles away) with good service and with reasonable price."}
{"text":"Finally, a nice breakfast spot right near our house. The staff was extremely warm and attentive. The eggs Benedict on a tarragon biscuit was GREAT. The owner (DAWN, not PAM) is a local and her food is delicious!  It is small, but I feel that adds to the unique vibe this place emits."}
{"text":"Tiny local place, easy to miss, but don't. Staff is friendly, food is limited but very good. Breakfast/ brunch/ lunch only.  The $10 for $16 was a surprise bonus."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Fresh and delicious. Our son loves the pancakes. This is a genuine local joint where they remember your name, remember your favorites and always treat you like family."}
{"text":"Super cute local bistro!  Amazing waffles, service with a smile.  Kid friendly!  My new fav local spot."}
{"text":"I stopped at Benedict's again for a BLT.  It was fantastic.  I also grabbed a pecan / chocolate tart, it was really delicious and rich."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. I'd say 3.5 stars to be fair. Came here on a Saturday morning for breakfast. Food was reasonably priced and tasted pretty good. Service was very friendly.  Only downfall was the wait. It took half an hour to get our food and there are only 5 tables in the place so efficiency is not their strength. Other than the slow service i recommend trying this one out."}
{"text":"What a wonderful establishment. Small, hole in the wall breakfast restaurant. Hands down my favorite place to eat with the family.  The menu items are plentiful and the prices are on par. They have all your coffee, loose teas, and other morning drinks available. Definitely try their pastries, I haven't found one that I haven't liked. Make sure you check in for your free coffee. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice quiet place with the friendliest staff I have encountered in a while. The food is good and they even made accommodations on the menu because I couldn't decide between. The the French toast or blueberry pancakes so gave me both. Espresso for 1$ is worth the money and the challah egg sandwich decent sized and prepared well. The pics match the actual portion sizes. Should eat here for nice breakfast or quick brunch. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Dawn and her team are amazing!! The food is delicious and the staff are amazing. We used them for our wedding of 180 people in March. We worked with dawn to come up with our family style menu. Absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"What a GEM!  Local, fresh and delicious!!!  We were looking for a new breakfast spot and I was so happy to have stumbled upon Benedict's!  There are only a few tables inside and a couple outside as well.  It was a little awkward at first to have to order and hover while waiting for a table but the turnover/timing was just fine.  The staff was warm and friendly - this is the type of place you WISH to find more of here in the valley.  The french toast was made with really thick cut brioche and it was eggy and custardy in the middle - perfection!  And I'm still thinking about how amazing the benedict with smoked salmon was!  I'm often disappointed in hollandaise, but this was top notch.  They cater during the week and aren't open to the public, so getting breakfast on the weekends ONLY makes it extra special!  Well done!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went here this morning after a boot camp workout and it was exactly what we needed to fill us up.  My husband had a cappuccino and the florentine benedict, I had a salted caramel cappuccino and the burrito with bacon and veggies added.  We both really enjoyed our food & coffees.  Tasty, simple, priced well.  Our entire bill was like $26.  The people working were super friendly.  It is extremely small, but based upon the French-style decor I noticed, I think it's supposed to be like a small cafe that you would find in Europe, so just know it's not a place you're probably going to hang out at for an extended period of time and smaller groups will fit better.  You order at a counter and then find a spot to sit (there are about 5 tables inside and a handful outside).  It'd be a great spot to pop in and grab a coffee/pastry on the go if you're looking for that instead of a sit down meal as well.  I'd go back if in the area. My husband is more likely to go back since it is near his office.  It is next to Circle K, but quite honestly, we have so many businesses/restaurants in strip malls around this state that it didn't bother me at all and I didn't notice a ton of traffic going to/from the gas station either."}
{"text":"Excellent Arizona eggs benedict, spicy chorizos with a nice fruit bowl, with blueberries blackberries, kiwi and raspberries, which is such a nice change from mellon and cantaloupe."}
{"text":"This place was such a cute hole in the wall. Everything tasted so fresh and the pastries were amazing! The staff are super friendly! Wished they had a nicer outside patio for great weather!"}
{"text":"Perfectly poached eggs & a savory tarragon biscuit are a match made in heaven. As an Eggs Benedict connoisseur I highly recommend Benedict's Cafe!!"}
{"text":"My food was very good,  the other customer with me however food came out cold.  It took us over 20 minutes to get a cup of coffee and the people next to us who came in 35 minutes after us were served before us.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great brunch place good prices and awesome deserts! It's kind of small but I never have had trouble finding a seat"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place I just went because my coffee pot was broken to get a coffee. My husband and I decided to go back for breakfast. I had the crepes today but I can't wait to go back to try the eggs benedict or grilled cheese sandwich with brie. The coffee was delicious as well. Don't let the strip mall appearance fool you this place has a very upscale menu and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I love this quaint, small, cozy cafe.  I have been there many times for breakfast and lunch.  The breakfast egg's benedict are a marvelous change from the boring english muffin they are usually served on.  The flavor of the homemade biscuit is marvelous!  I have had the blueberry and chocolate pancakes that are to die for!  The lunch menu serves wonderfully fresh sandwiches and I especially love the tomato basil soup.  Well the peach mango iced tea is addictive I can tell you, the hint of fruit eliminates the need for a sweetener.  I have not been unhappy with any service or ingredient yet!  I will be a loyal fan forever!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here to eat breakfast and it was delicious. The price is great for the quality! Cute lil gem with great coffee!"}
{"text":"I coukd have easily overlooked this being in a little strip center with a gas station but saw the yelp reviews.  It is very small but charming. I had the eggs benedict and lox- very tasty!  I was wondering how they could stay in business in that location but it seems like their main business is catering, so makes sense."}
{"text":"The food here is great.  The place is small and they don't take reservations so tables are hit or miss, but nothing to fault them for, just don't bring a large party to eat here - order from thier catering menu to you venue instead"}
{"text":"Seems like something has changed here.  We visited for breakfast this weekend for the first time in awhile (we'd tried a few weekends in the spring and they were always closed for one reason or another) and walked out disappointed.  This used to be our go-to breakfast spot.  The people at the counter used to be personable and friendly...didn't get that vibe at all this time.  The menu seems like it has changed significantly - our favorite items were gone.  Used to be a wide variety of pastries and desserts displayed, as well as listed on the board on the wall.  All gone.  The \"cozy\" and \"warm\" feeling just wasn't there anymore.  To top it off, the food wasn't nearly as good this time either.  My wife ordered the eggs benedict and it was cold - she also assumed the eggs would be poached but they weren't.  Her exact words were \"This was actually kind of gross.\"  The potatoes also seemed much different than I remember - very oily this time.  My california benedict was fair... not nearly as good as the lox benedict that I used to order (and is now off the menu).  The first time we came here years ago the food thoroughly impressed us - that's what kept us coming back on a regular basis.  Nothing about our meal today would have us in a hurry to return.  Hope maybe we caught them (and the food) on an off-day?  Really bummed...this used to be one of our favorite breakfast places.  Glad there's many other choices around town."}
{"text":"Simply put.... The food is delicious! The prices were great! The quiche was excellent! I will definitely be back.... But don't bring too many people, it's a small cozy setting. A new fav...."}
{"text":"I was so excited when we found this place a few weeks ago. Today we went back and service was horrible!!  They are a small shop and have very little seating arrangements. When we got there the line was out the door.  This I expected and was willing and able to wait but the service we had makes me not want to go back   My husband grabbed the menu and the lady running register replied don't take that we are running low he proceeded to get in line and she Mede comment to person she was ringing up she wasn't kidding.   The young guy took our order he had been there last time very personable but distracted since busy. Last time he was mr personality and impeccable service   We sat outside and got our water about 10 minutes after we placed our order. About another 10 after that we were still waiting on coffees. I went in to get the lady was bussing tables and a other girl finally brought coffee but it was only one   Finally got our food. And asked about my coffee. Another 10 minutes and coffee came out.  It was supposed to be a dirty chai and tasered like Milk over ice.  Very disappointing   We paid 34 dollars for 2 coffees. A slice of quiche with fruit and a yogurt parfait which was a coffee cup with about 7 pieces of fruit and yogurt. And the toast flite.   I was so excited about this place they are local and the food last time was so good and presentation was amazing. This weekend they tanked   Sad when you want to support local and can't even get coffee on under 20 minutes and then have it taste horrible.:(.   Watched as several other customers had to go back and ask for things that they ordered and didn't get"}
{"text":"The star rating is based on the food.  I ordered the eggs benedict and it was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  If it wasn't for the flavorful, but still overly dry biscuit, I'd give it 2 stars. Definitely could use more sauce.  The ladies at the counter were friendly and accommodating.  I'd be willing to give another menu item a try and only because it's close to my house."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough. love this place.  I wept with joy when I discovered there was a non-chain alternative in the area that serves great coffee and great food. French roast + raspberry scone = happy out of towner who doesn't feel so out of town."}
{"text":"This place is tiny.  We came on a Saturday morning for breakfast and there were 3 tables and one other couple eating.  The person that sat us looked like she may have also been the owner and there was only 1 other person in the back cooking.  We both ordered the breakfast burrito, which was small and bland.  I did take home a fresh almond horn which I ate later and was pretty tasty.  Probably wont return since the original breakfast house is nearby and is awesome."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for breakfast. The service is really nice and fast and the food is good. I got the omelet egg breakfast with a side of bacon and my boyfriend got the breakfast, which we both loved. We're definitely coming back for another Saturday brunch."}
{"text":"So after reading the reviews, my husband and I decided to go to Benedict's Cafe for Saturday brunch. To say that this place had great potential is an understatement. It may have been located in a Circle K strip mall, but going in, the cute decor, small tables and pastry place provided a nice (if not a bit cramped) environment. Walking in at around 11am, we clearly interrupted the counter waitress, the cook and his assistant who were sitting at the front table reading the newspaper. A slow morning at Benedict's perhaps? Regardless, the ambiance and the nice counter waitress made for a pleasant time.  We asked what the counter waitress suggested. She said the eggs Benedict were the best and that the breakfast burritos were popular. My husband got the Benedict with a lemonade and I got a breakfast burrito and a decaf coffee. As we sat down, a steady stream of people came in, which bode well for the locally-owned business. Being a proud Phoenician, I love to see local businesses doing well.  Well, the food came and let me just start by saying that it's hard to mess up a breakfast burrito. I mean (in this case), it's scrambled eggs, 2 strips of bacon, cheese and potatoes in a tortilla. It tasted just fine, however, it was evident that the only thing that was recently cooked were the eggs. The bacon was good, but cold and the potatoes were (in my estimation) cooked at 9am that morning - very cold and very old. The cheese couldn't melt because everything in the tortilla except for the eggs was cold! On the upside, the counter waitress had to make a fresh pot of decaf coffee and let me tell you,  it was probably one of the best cups of decaf coffee I have ever had.  As another aside, if you call your place \"Benedict's Cafe\" you had better have an amazing eggs benedict, but it wasn't amazing. It was an overpriced ok try. Unlike other Benedicts, this one was on a drop biscuit -- a very hard and cold drop biscuit. The biscuit wasn't able to soak up the runny egg and just crumbled apart when touched making it very hard to eat. The holandaise was separated and flavorless. And considering the $10 price tag, WAY overpriced for what we were served. (my husband had a bit of indigestion afterward as well). As a side dish, once again, the cold and old potatoes made an appearance. I mention the potatoes again, because potatoes are so inexpensive and easy to fry up quickly, there is no reason ours were so substandard.  Maybe the sandwiches (that don't have to be cooked) are better. The pastry case was only partially filled with danishes and muffins and a few cookies. I think that I was expecting more -- a local place like Galleo in McCormick Ranch.  I really wanted to like this place. I really did, but I was so disappointed, I am not sure that I would give it another shot."}
{"text":"What a great little surprise this place was. In a strip mall with a small sign, this place is big on charm and the food was way better than you would expect. We had the breakfast burrito and the croissant sandwich w/pesto. Both were out of this world. There are only ~4 small tables inside and another 4 outside, so space is very limited. Don't miss this place if you live n. Phoenix and are looking for a chill little place with great food."}
{"text":"The perfect spot for a weekend breakfast. Small and cute with plenty of delicious options. My husband got the berry crepes which were light and fresh and I got the lox open sandwich. Iced coffee had a cinnamon hint and I didn't need any sweetener. Potatoes had nice seasoning and cooked perfectly. Ordered a side of bacon to split and half was the way my husband likes, floppy and the other half had a crisp like I like. It's like they knew! Nice, friendly staff. Only open on Saturday and Sunday during the summer."}
{"text":"California Benedict and Croque Monsueir, both quite delicious, as well as an almond blossom. Awesome atmosphere as well! Try the Mexican coffee, flavored of cinnamon and chocolate, yum! Staff was friendly and welcoming, we will be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  We enjoyed the berry crepes and vegetarian omelet.  The service was so friendly, will definitely make this a go to brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!! Super small but the sent when you walk in is incredible!! On our way back to San Diego and stopped for breakfast. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"this is a very small (3 two tops, and 2 three tops) breakfast spot. the food was good. the service was friendly. I just wish the menu had more egg-free options :)"}
{"text":"This place is way better than expected. I would normally not even consider a restaurant which shares a parKing lot with Circle K.   Pros: Very tasty food. Great spice on the potatoes, Belgian chocolate pancakes very rich chocolate and super light and fluffy pancakes were a great combo. Sourdough bread for the California Benedict was huge. Service was very fast and friendly. They use Passport iced tea and brew it with no bitterness.  Cons: not much seating, view of Circle K kind of sucks.  II WILL be back!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but the service was terrible. I came here because of their high yelp rating but it did not meet my expectations."}
{"text":"This is a nice little spot and our go to brunch. The food is great and the service is even better. Love the benedicts they have here and the French toast is perfect, not too sweet. Check the offers on Yelp for and even better deal."}
{"text":"OMG WOW factor!!!! Excellent food: tasty and delicious. Only open for sit in dining on Saturday and Sunday but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Benedict's was the perfect spot for Sunday breakfast! Quaint surroundings, awesome service, and delicious food! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Drive by this place all the time and never really noticed it as it is tucked back in the shopping complex. Finally noticed it and after doing to research decided to give it a shot and it did not disappoint. We did two different Benedict's (Arizona and California) both of which were awesome. The yolks were running and a nice portion. Also sampled the waffles and they were amazing. Potatoes and coffee choices were good as well. The staff there were friendly and engaging. Glad we are finding little gems like this place in the area. Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was awesome & the Hallah French toast was Delish!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a ton and finally decided to give it a try on a Saturday morning. It was a lot smaller than I expected, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I still was able to get seated right away, with my girlfriend and I getting the last table.   In all, the food was quite good and the service is attentive - how can they not be with this place being so \"intimate.\"   I'm looking forward to going back, especially for lunch to check out their sandwich selection."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Hours are weird.  Minimal seating available.  I'd say probably 4 stars for catering, somewhere between 3 and 4 for dine-in.  I have a gift certificate that I've not rallied enough enthusiasm for the place to drive down there to use since I can't get the wife to go back."}
{"text":"Was looking for homes in the area to move to and decided to drop in for a quick breakfast. We were blown away by the service and food here! Outstanding California and salmon Benedict and a breakfast burrito to top it off. They even gave us complementary pastries for being first time customers which made our day. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone in the area looking for an unbelievable breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Orange juice, coffee, and everything on menu is great quality and very good. Small place. Better for a couple or few people."}
{"text":"My mom and I tried this place out on Saturday morning. The place was PACKED and small but we were seated very quickly and there was no wait for a table (I think they were doing quite a bit of \"to-go\" service).  The prices are about $10/dish (they charge for extras so it can be closer to $15). I ordered a breakfast burrito (yummy!) and my mom  ordered the eggs benedict with lox (she would have liked more lox). The dishes don't come with any sides like hash browns or fruit (it is a small business) but the mains were filling enough and we both felt satisfied. I'm not gonna lie though, we both felt a small sense of disappointment when our dishes came out at first-pretty but small servings :P  The service was AWESOME. Our server was attentive and sweet and completely on top of what she was doing. We were super impressed with the customer service skills of all the employees.   At the end of our meal, we were given these adorable cookie packs as a courtesy dessert (had sugar cookies and macaroons). I tried the macaroons at home and they are TO DIE FOR!  Good food, good service, good time was had :)"}
{"text":"Yesterday my family drove all the way over from goodyear to meet my elderly aunt for breakfast only to did out they were closed for a \"special event\" Yelp said open. So we had to change the location on my aunt last minute resulting in an extra hour finding a new place an then trying to explain an unfamiliar area to her. Food looked excellent but that ticks me ofd"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. This place would be the premier breakfast spot in Phoenix IF they had decent service and a better atmosphere. I realize it's actually a catering company with a small store front, but it could be HUGE in this town. It blew away Butterfields, Scramble, Snooze, etc. The quality of the food was outstanding but the service was non-existent."}
{"text":"One of the tips said if I like horse poop, I will like this.  Well, I have to say, after eating here, I started harvesting the poop of the horses from my neighbor.  I tried frying it, and it just wasn't the same as the eggs I had here.  So I tried baking it, because I thought maybe the reviewer had one of the pastries instead.  No dice.  After several different experimental horse poop recipes and a few ER visits, I gave up.  It's just not the same.  So if you like horse poop, don't come here!  If you like delicious, well-crafted breakfast meals, please join me here!"}
{"text":"Normally I'd give a 2-star rating for the experience we had during this visit, but I felt a little sorry for the lady behind the counter - it wasn't a great day for her so we'll leave it at 3.  Showed up on Father's Day for brunch, around 10:30am or so. Was surprised by how small this place is, there's barely enough room for two or three tables inside, and you have to order at the counter then find a seat. And when one customer is at the counter, the people waiting behind are already almost out the door - just bear this in mind, Benedicts is quite literally the size of an average house's half-bathroom.  Anyway, the couple in front took forever to order, I don't know whether it was a combination of them just having no idea what they wanted or delays on the checkout side, but I swear I was standing there for almost ten minutes during the hemming and hawing. Finally we get to the front. Ordered our stuff, was a bit shocked at the bill but whatever, it's Scottsdale, we've just moved here, it was Father's Day, shrug. Tetrissed our way outside past the patrons behind us to one of the exterior tables. I thought to look at the bill and that's when I noticed that they had put an extra entree on that we didn't order which drove up the price. Went back inside and chatted to the lady. She started working on the system to issue a refund (meanwhile more customers came in) - they have one of these new-fangled touchscreen capers in there running on an iPad or something and she told me she had never done a refund with it before. No prob. I told her that she could go ahead and tend to the customers behind me before we settled the refund but she wanted to square it away quickly so in the interest of time and expediency she just gave me cash back. No prob. Back to our table outside to wait.  My chocolate croissant was delivered fairly quickly. It was pretty good, drizzled with dark chocolate (not my favourite, but I wasn't too fussed). Main food came out after about 15 min, including that meal that we didn't order. They let us keep it for free.. but there was no way I could have eaten it AND my actual plate.  Now for the food breakdown: I got the Benedict with roasted potatoes and herbed biscuit. The eggs were ok although very runny. The biscuit was a little too hard and crumbly for my liking. The potatoes were old and dry on both plates - they looked nothing at all like the potatoes that you see in Monika C's photo. All up, wouldn't order again. At this point I realised that they had forgotten my coffee. The lady went past delivering to another table and I almost cringed when I told her that my coffee had been forgotten. She asked what sort of coffee I'd ordered - it was the French roast. It was delivered seconds later, super hot - and with no cream/milk/sugar to speak of. I didn't bother asking for some because by this point we were sweating and needed to finish off and bail before we melted. No refill offered on the coffee, no refills offered on the water.  I checked in on Yelp, and saw an offer for free coffee on checkin. Again, decided not to take action on that. No time.  Bottom line? I'm honestly not sure we'll return, but like I said I did feel sorry for the counter lady. She seemed a bit pressed, although I don't know if I can reconcile that with the fact that there's about five tables maximum here and the line was hardly longer than two people waiting at any given time. I simply wasn't a fan of the food or the price."}
{"text":"My wife and I live right around the corner and decided it was time to stop in for one of their famous cinnamon buns.  Luckily the batch was fresh out of the oven and let me tell you the thing was phenomenal.  Moist, fluffy, warm and sweet.  I hope to return soon for another bun and to try their breakfast and lunch selections which look awesome."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  We had the quiche and croissant breakfast sandwich. Both were outstanding and ample portion sizes. The place is very small and quaint. The crust on the quiche was to die for!  It was the perfect flakey crust you expect out of a quiche."}
{"text":"I think the word needs to come out. This place is no longer opened for business on weekdays. Only on Saturday's & Sunday's from 8 am. I decided to go there this morning but I gotta say it was very fustrating to do it in vain. The stars are because of the warm welcome from the lady sitting down in the computer taking the time to let me know that Benedict's is now mostly a catering service restaurant. So I was turned out, but nicely. I definitely think that the sign at the door should be more explicit. And also make it a bigger effort, at least to the neighborhood and surrounding areas that they are no longer available pretty much all week. I'm pretty much confused about the advertised Yelp deal. Why offer such a deal if they're not really opened? And if they do, they should put it right on the wall: \"Establishment closed all week. Come only Sat and Sun'. Like I said... They need to be more explicit."}
{"text":"My husband now have our weekly breakfast at Benedict's after using a Yelp deal on a whim when we were hungry. Honestly, this is an example of how effective a daily deal (Groupon, Yelp, whatever) can be in generating repeat customers if you a truly a great business! The food is exceptional. The place is very, very small and it's obvious that they cater to their customers and that comes first. My kids love the crepes, hubby loves the breakfast burrito. The service is consistently attentive and fantastic. For a little tiny strip mall place in Scottdale/Phoenix, you absolutely cannot beat the quality of the food and experience!!"}
{"text":"4.5! The coffee was wonderfully delicious! Foamy not to strong but definitely not weak. It is as many have stated a very small place but the service is great. The food is good, we had benedicts, and crepes but the chorizo potatoes definitely took over, they are really good! But again THE LATTE, caramel-hazelnut. Finding a place with good food and great coffee is not an easy task, will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We came here with my fiancé and my grandma. They were nearly empty when we arrived, but that place is so quaint and tiny. We love the atmosphere.   This time we ordered 3 Eggs Benedicts. Our drinks came out fairly quickly, however the Benedicts took almost 30-40 minutes! We even started joking that they had to go fish for salmon to make fresh lox. Other people's orders came out way before us even if they sat down after. We suspected they forgot about ours.  The staff was very apologetic and attentive. We usually never have this issue here and the weather was so great, we understood and waited. When the food finally did arrive, it was delicious as always. My lox Benedict was so yummy! And my peeps liked their food also. They even gave us a chocolate croissant at the end of our meal to make up for the wait. Their pastries are amazing too.  I am giving it 4 stars because of the extremely long wait for the food. But the quality and the staff made up for it."}
{"text":"I am adding to my below previous review, because I went here recently and it seems they changed the California Benedict slightly and not for the better. It used to come on toasted sourdough which was delicious and part of what made it a California. This last time it came out on a different kind of bread un-toasted. I'm not even sure what kind of bread it was, but it really changed the flavor of the Benedict in its entirety. Also, the roasted red potatoes had way too much seasoning on them that I could barely eat them. It was a disappointing visit considering my friend and I used to frequent this place all the time.   My best friend and I finally got around to trying out Benedict's last weekend. Benedict's is a small quaint cafe that also offers cooking classes. The eggs benedict is what drew us in as it is a breakfast dish favorite. We both decided on the California benedict that was served on sourdough bread instead of a traditional English muffin. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly which isn't always the case when I order a benedict. We both thoroughly enjoyed our eggs benedicts and thought the prosciutto was a nice touch combined with the tomato and avocado. I was also very excited that they had a pumpkin spice latte as pumpkin season is my favorite. It was delicious and very comparable to Starbucks which I was quite impressed by. I did purchase the deal on Yelp and was able to use it right then which was a nice little savings. The two gals that run the place were really nice and friendly. My only critique would be that the service could be improved. Our server forgot our water and when it came time to pay we waited a while with our cards on the bill and eventually had to go inside to get their attention. All in all it was a good experience and we will go back."}
{"text":"I'm grateful to Andy B. for writing the first review of Benedict's and talking about their outstanding desserts. I have been in several times for lunch and am completely impressed with everything. They've even turned an iced-tea cynic into an aficionado with their passion mango iced-tea. Great food, great environment (with sweeping views of the McDowell Mountains from the patio... that I may have embellished slightly) and great people. It's nice to find a place that has all three elements executed very well. They also do an outstanding breakfast / brunch on the weekends with some amazing options. I highly recommend a drive over to Dawn and Kelsey to check this place out."}
{"text":"I pulled into a Circle K parking lot and immediately thought \"food poisoning is upon me.\" My experience quickly proved that thought wrong. Benedict's is a quaint bakery/ cafe in the middle of the suburbs. Clean, modern but not cold, great food and excellent service. Our waitress gave off a \"cool mom\" vibe and was attentive without being overbearing.  I ordered the lemon poppy seed muffin and a fruit and yogurt parfait. Both were above average. The muffin was warm, crunchy on top and moist in the middle. Yogurt tasted homemade and had a hint of vanilla bean. The almond granola is made locally and tastes delicious.  Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Really small place. I'd guess maybe 5 tables all together. The weather was really nice so we sat outside. I had the name-sake Eggs Benedict (they have a handful of varieties of them). It threw me off a little because it was on a biscuit instead of an english muffin but it was delicious. +1, would eat again."}
{"text":"This tiny corner always delights with fresh and flavorful ingredients. Very personal touch. Feels like catering for one. Coffee always fresh... Love the yogurt parfait. Subtle sweetness with a surprise touch of cinnamon"}
{"text":"The quiche was excellent!  I haven't seen a restaurant in San Antonio ever in life that has served a quiche...Looks like a Phoenix move won't be so bad after all.  This place was quaint but not a hipster quaint just a chill place to eat brunch.  The food was quick and the quiche was on point.  The crust was super flaky and the mushrooms were nice!  This will be a recurring spot for brunch once my moves finished!"}
{"text":"This place is close to being great. The food is very good and the location is perfect. We live in the neighborhood so we walk over from time to time.  The only downside is the service. Don't get me wrong, the people are awesome but everything is a bit slow and attention is not always paid. That being said, the food makes up for it.  They have multiple different \"Benedicts\" all of which are delicious. They also make a great breakfast burrito. Add in great coffee and this is a great little brunch spot.  Looking forward to it again this weekend!"}
{"text":"So glad my husband found this place on yelp. It was soooo delicious! It's a little hole in wall place but it super cute and the staff is really friendly. The food was so fresh and well seasoned. I would definitely recommend it for a great place to eat breakfast or brunch :)"}
{"text":"Place is very nice! Came here twice and have got the eggs Benedict two times. Service is always fast and friendly, food is always great and my pitbull loves coming here!  We will be back and I'm sure I will get the same thing. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican spice coffee, the prices are a little on the high side but worth it when you get fresh ingredients in all the food!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito, fantastic service, delicious salsa!"}
{"text":"Amazing French toast! It's refreshing to find a small cafe that still cares about the quality of there food. Everyone in my party couldn't help share with each other, hoping to brag about how good their choice was, but everyone's food was just as amazing as the other's. Even Gabe ended up sharing some of his burro! Haha can't wait to try more"}
{"text":"Interesting little cafe tucked in the back of an otherwise ordinary shopping center. The eggs Benedict was delicious, fruit was fresh, service was...okay.  I think the waiter was new, but it wasn't a big deal.  The food came out right and everyone really liked what they got.   Final note, As we were getting up to leave, they were bussing the table when some coffee fell on one of the girls I was with. They were very apologetic and even offered her cash for any dry cleaning (which she rejected), accidents happen and they did the right thing."}
{"text":"This cafe is super small with seating inside for 10 and seating outside for maybe another 10. There aren't any high chairs so it's not very good for small children (there's also no kid's menu.) there are a wide selection of lattes, pastries and other goodies and the menu, while pretty small, is pretty thorough with the normal breakfast fare. I ordered French toast with raspberries (but got blueberries - I didn't say anything because my son ate them up), bacon and a dirty chai latte. I also ordered a small warm milk for my 2 year old. It was a little pricey for what I ordered - $21.50. Overall, it's a nice spot for a quick bite but not a place I would choose to visit for a long casual breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"We wanted to love this place. Let me say that the overall food quality is great, they know food. I just think they need more staff or more trained staff?  I got a breakfast blt. It came with no bacon. Ok, stuff happens.  We went in and stood in line and got some perfect bacon and added it. My sandwich  was on great quality sourdough, but they forgot to toast it. :( At this point, I didn't want to send it back.  Husbands croissant sandwich was good too, but was the opposite of my un-toasted toast. It was over toasted so it crumbled easily. The outside service is a little awkward too. Great coffee served there but cream and other fixins are inside. Like I said, good quality food, just room for improvement."}
{"text":"Cutest little cafe tucked away in a small strip mall. Barbara and Dawn were very helpful and so nice. My boyfriend and I like to try different spots for brunch on Sundays and this place is definitely a place we will come back to again and again. I got the croissant sandwich and my boyfriend got the Barbara omelet. Both were so tasty and perfectly portioned. I would HIGHLY recommend this cute cafe!"}
{"text":"This review is specific to the culinary classes offered through the cafe.  Knowing the one thing that binds my eccentric/diverse work team together, is their overall love for eating and good food, my Über creative boss opted for a cooking class as a team building event.  We were each given Benedict's Cafe extensive course offering list and asked to pick those that we would be most interested.  The current list has over 30 offerings and I have to say I truly would have been pleased with any one of the options. The overall team opinion was for \"Pizza from the Home Oven\" and so it was.  We arrived at the cafe which is normally closed on Monday, but had been opened just for our private class. As others have mentioned, the cafe itself is quite small. But to be honest it feels more like what I am used to seeing in European cafe (walk up/take out). There is a counter full of delicious looking eye candy and a menu board with the available options for more substantial choices. The handful of bistro tables seem really more for convenience and there were some tables that appeared to be normally set up in the front of the cafe.  We were greeted by Chef Shock and after a brief wait for final preps in the kitchen we were whisked off (pun intended) to the back of the cafe. Chef could not have been nicer, or more welcoming. She gave us a brief background on her training (she graduated with honors from Le Cordon Bleu educated, has a gazillion specialty training courses under her apron, and is one of only 6 certified pastry chefs in AZ... kudos!) and as we would be nibbling the fruits of our labor as we went along, offered us a salad course paired with a fresh rosemary and olive focaccia to get us started. Both were wonderful and by now I for one was ready to get this pizza rolling.  There were 7 of us there, so we divided the prep work or shredding, chopping, slicing, and browning. Each of us was given individual instruction by Chef on the best execution approach and what would make the final product as good as it gets.   Chef had started the dough so it could begin proofing and after a little education on how something goes from one ewey gooey dough to either a beautiful and airy ciabatta, a light and tender focaccia, or the star of the day - pizza crust.  She worked up a sample crust, applied toppings in the ideal amounts and order - taking in to consideration moisture content, cooking limitations we would have to translate to home ovens, etc. and popped the first pie in the oven.  Then we each got started on our own versions. Flour flew, dough was tossed (and flopped in one instance - LOL), crusts were formed, toppings were and styles differed for each and within a very short time, all the pies were baking away. As a final example, Chef had us use some of the remaining ingredients to make a \"bad pie\" so that we could see what not to do.  When the flour settled, there were 8 beautiful pizza pies and 1 that was a little on the freakish side. We all sampled the creations and packed up our leftovers to take home.  Before our experience was over, Chef Shock started another batch of dough so we could see that process, divided up the dough to take home, gave us the recipe so we could play chef in our own kitchens, and served up some delectable chocolate chip cookies that she had baked for us before we arrived.  I went home stuffed with great food. Had a fantastic time getting to play with my coworkers in a completely different environment. Took home 2 heaping clam shells with pizza, dough to create something on my own, and a ton of extra toppings that we couldn't fit on our pies (oh and cookies). Seriously I could barely carry the haul to my car.  I can't remember having more fun, let alone a work event and am absolutely signing up for more courses (which you can register for on-line). The price is reasonable considering you get 3 hours of basically personalized instruction. Class sizes seem to range between 4 and 6, so there isn't much chance you would be ignored. Chef Shock told the group that if you have a group of 4 people interested in something specific, they will put together a private class for you and in those cases, ask about BYOB.  If you sign up for a class, let me know, I may join you... that is, if I haven't already made my way through the class list!  : )"}
{"text":"This place is super awkward. It is so so small with only about 3 tables inside and 3 tables outside. The menu looked good although smaller with only a handful of choices. I had a toddler with me and the bathroom was no where in site. I asked and was directed through the kitchen, the chef and the guy washing dishes to get to the bathroom. It was...awkward. I might try this place another time when I am without a kid- but it won't be the first choice on my list."}
{"text":"I was extremely satisfied with my trip to Benedicts.  I had the pleasure of being served by Dawn, the owner.  Let me just say that her little place is as charming as she is.  The atmosphere is great for a small gathering of friends or business associates.    I had the bacon burrito and thought it was delicious.  The eggs and filling were light, instead of the greasy, over seasoned experience you get from a lot of breakfast burritos.    We also got a sneak peak at an upcoming menu item, the \"Egg in a Basket.\"  It was a very cute little creation :)  After meeting Dawn and tasting her food, I'm excited about having her cater for me at a future event."}
{"text":"They didn't have several of the items we asked for on the menu and no espresso machine.  Very limited seating. No air conditioning!!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"A nice tiny cafe! Pretty cute, not much seating, but there weren't many people when we went. I liked the decor inside and the pastries that they had on display looked incredible, especially the big cookies they had! Also liked that they had all these different flavors of lattes displayed on a chalk board. Cool flavors like s'mores and Nutella! I will have to get one next time I come. We had to walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was kind of weird haha, but it was nice to see the kitchen! It was very clean, ingredients were looking fresh. The girls working there were all super nice and helpful. I got a free tea thanks to yelp! I got the peach mango black tea, and my mom got the pomegranate green tea. I liked the green tea better, but they were both pretty good. The menu seemed to have some good vegetarian-friendly options. I love quiche and was happy to hear that the quiche they had that day was spinach, mushroom, and goat cheese so I ordered that! My mom got the Barbara omelette without cheese. We both had potatoes as our side. I would have preferred my food to be a little more heated, but I still liked it. Also the potatoes were a little tough, but I loved the spices on it. The quiche had a yummy flaky crust and I thought it was pretty good. My moms omelette was tasty also. Our meals weren't too pricey either. Thumbs up for Benedicts!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I attended on Sunday morning for brunch. I would say, the service is the downfall for this restaurant. We had not been there before, sat at a table outside. The waitress passed us by twice outside without a word. Finally, I step inside and cannot see the sign (below the counter) that says, order here as there is someone in front of it. I step outside, again to find the waitress and I ask her how it works. She doesn't welcome us, instead, she says, you order inside, didn't you see the sign? Well, no I didn't because someone was blocking it. So, fine, I went back inside and ordered when someone else came to the counter as I was waiting. Placed my order, and requested to pay, and then apply a tip, which I wasn't eager to do because I am not sure how my service will play out. I went back outside to sit with my boyfriend. A family comes outside, whereas the waitress happily greets them, and takes their order outside!!!! UMMM, thought you couldn't do that? Apparently, it looked to me, that they may have been a returning customer or someone she knew, so she was giving them an extra or special treatment. They were getting better service, hands down. I thought the service was below par to say the least. The food was actually pretty decent, although, the presentation on the small plates, was not attractive, the taste of the actual food was good. With the $30 that I paid for in the brunch, I would expect better service, a smile, and service outside not having to go inside. Needless to say, it's in a strip mall, I tried it, but if you want to set yourself aside from others, you need to have better service and you clearly do not. We will not be returning. I can go to another establishment that will provide me with service. Don't waste your time on this place!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast, though not too many options and a bit overpriced for what you get.  Ingredients are super fresh though, and the food is quite delicious.  Try the Mexican spiced coffee, it's great."}
{"text":"Such a cute spot! brought my friends from out of town here, they absolutely loved it. Fresh. Flavorful. Unique. Y'all gotta taste the Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Great little place.  Really good, fresh food.  On the weekend its all about the eggs Benedict. All of the employees are really friendly. Keep up the good work, Dawn and company!"}
{"text":"Quaint brunch spot in North Scottsdale.  Coming from Portland, I appreciate the local and small business focus of this eatery.  Tarragon biscuits for the benedicts are very good.  I wish Yelp would let me rate 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is extremely small. 4 tables in the entire place. We had to sit outside at 1 of the two tables. We eventually moved inside once a few people left, which was extremely uncomfortable.   Let's move on to the food...  I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito and added squash.  We also ordered a burrito with sausage and a bacon omelet.  The server came back and told us they were out of sausage so we switched it to ham.  He then came back and told us they were out of flour tortillas. So we switched it to wheat.  During the time between ordering food and getting it I ordered a coffee as well as my friend. We never got it...   Our portions were honestly embarrassing. My burrito was so small. No side.  The omelet was the same.   We never saw our server again. The staff was rude and complaining to each other.   We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Eating at Benedict's made me feel like having brunch at my favorite aunt's house. The place was homey, the service was warm and the food was comforting.   The place was small and only had a few small tables. There were some tables outside that offered seating for larger groups. I can easily understand if it would take a while to get a table on a busy day. Good thing (or unfortunately) we got to Benedict's a little past lunch already. We immediately got a table and we were greeted as soon as we went through the door. I don't think they have a lot of servers. Take note of this when you visit this place when it's busy. I would think everyone would scramble to make sure everyone is helped and taken cared of. As I've written, the place felt like home, even my own mom or aunt would have a hard time managing several guest at one time.  The service was hands-on. The lady who served us during our visit was very warm. She was engaging and very friendly. Again, like what I wrote, she was just like my favorite aunt. I did have some concerns, else I would have rated this with 5 stars. I ordered 3 items from their menu that were not available. Thus, why coming here late might be a disadvantage. They ran out of fruit for the crepe, challah bread for the french toast and avocado for the California eggs Benedict. Would have been nice to try it out. Maybe i'll come in early the next time so I get to try what I want.  The food that were served to us was very good. Let me correct that, it was very good. It was better than other big time brunch places that I have visited. it was original and full of flavor. We had the Arizona eggs benedict and their egg and bacon croissant sandwich. The croissant sandwich was soft, airy and tasty. The additional kick on the sandwich was the pesto sauce. The egg was cooked nicely and the bacon, though not as crispy as I wanted had a good bite as well. My wife loved the Arizona eggs benedict. It had tomatillo sauce instead of the usual hollandaise sauce. There was also a hint of corn tortilla taste on the sauce that gave the dish a mexican finish. Eggs were poached perfectly and the runny yolk complimented the sauce. The sausage wasn't bad as well. Not too salty and but had enough kick at the end to tell you that you are eating a sausage.   Coffee and pastry were also very good. Add the warm ambience and service with good, Benedict's Cafe just felt like home.  more reviews at  http://themealexperience.blogspot.com/"}
{"text":"Benedicts is a charming neighborhood spot to grab a delicious weekend breakfast.  Not one through the week means you are craving them by Saturday.   Made to order omelettes, fresh pastries and delicious coffee headline the menu.  Also, they do a fabulous job catering as well.  Let them cater your next event!"}
{"text":"We went out for breakfast at our usual place but it was pack so we yelp nearest breakfast place and Benedict was it so we drove there Let me tell you is a very small place no line hardly any people there so we took a chance Wow food was amazing this place won't stay small for long try it out they have a nice menu to choose from I had the French omelette with shredded beef and she had the breakfast burrito Wow"}
{"text":"Very small and hard to find, but the food and the waitstaff were excellent. They offered two coffee roasts, my wife liked the. Mexican and I liked the French roast. We both had Benedict's. Hers was with smoked salmon which she said was really good. I got their Florentine Benedict with spinach and mushrooms over their tarragon biscuit, but I added Canadian bacon. One of the best, if not the best, eggs Benedict I have ever had."}
{"text":"I went one morning after craving some great breakfast food and i came across Benedict's Cafe on Yelp and figured i would give it a try because of the great reviews. Upon arrival Benedict's impressed me. It is a quaint little place with a few tables inside and a few outside, just enough to have everyone sit down and enjoy their food or an iced coffee/tea. We entered and they have great decor with a nice pastry display and lemon water for guests. The staff was wonderful, there was one employee who was there along with who i believed was the owner. She was extremely nice and accommodating making recommendations and helping in any way she could.  As for the food, we orded the berry crepes, breakfast burrito, an order of fresh fruit and some iced coffee and tea. First off the french roast was outstanding some of the best coffee in the scottsdale area. The crepes were amazing with fresh strawberries and a light creme that was just the perfect mix to fill the crepe. The breakfast burrito was a great portion without being too filling but just the right size.The tortilla was fresh and lightly flaky and the rest of the burrito was filled with fresh eggs and it wasn't greasy yet it was still moist and delicious. The fruit was also fresh and delicious with a great variety of fruit. The other thing was that though they were small and somewhat busy they still brought out the food in a timely manor.  Overall, this was an amazing find and i wil be going back often. I just hope they can handle all the people I will be recommending."}
{"text":"I liked this place. It's locally owned and very small. Tables are squeezed in. When we were there it was busy and we were not in a hurry. Okay.   First we waited in line to order then we were told to sit down and someone will take our order. Okay.   Then we were forgotten. Oops!   I had to go back up to the counter to order. I was told to wait. Okay. Then she forgot me again. Finally she remembered me as I stood at the counter for another 10 mins (about 40 mins later) was not apologetic a bit brisk in fact. Okay.   Then I showed her my check in offer from Yelp and her mouth formed into a small \"o\".   After that, not surprisingly, service improved. Oops!  Too late!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and very nice people! Awesome crepes and benedict!  Crepes, berries were super fresh and delicious creme. Benedict has savory potatos and fantastic hollandaise sauce. The tarragon biscuit underneath is a great base."}
{"text":"This is a small place and so expect to be waiting for some time if they are busy (which they usually are). The food is excellent but we would have walked out happier customers if the owner would not have created a ruckus over the Yelp deal we were trying to use. She claimed it had one coupon per table in fine print, wherein nothing of that sort was implied in the deal. The waiter who served us finally helped us use our Yelp coupons and we rewarded her handsomely for her effort."}
{"text":"Great food, incredibly friendly service and a nice atmosphere..can't beat that! My daughter had the amazing lemon crepes and Belgian mocha which she said was the best iced mocha she has ever had. I agree..not too sweet just full of flavor which can also be said of the crepes.  We had nice chats with some other clients which added a lot to the already sweet atmosphere.  We will return when back in the area for sure.  The owner Dawn was delightful and I can't thank her enough for recommending the Musical Instrument Museum because it is a must see for visitors to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food!!  Literally a 'hole in the wall' feel.   Highly recommend to those bruncher's in Phoenix in seek of the perfect Saturday AM break."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden breakfast gem. I feel a little guilty not writing a review, but selfishly don't want to have to endure long weekend waits.   I've been there 3 times now and have tried 3 different dishes plus the pastries. Each experience was consistently excellent. The tarragon lox and eggs Benedict was unique and perfectly prepared.   The breakfast burrito is one of the top 3 I've had in Arizona. I'm a breakfast burrito snob and Benedict's had the perfect combination of flavors without having any one component over power the other. Phenomenal!  As other reviewers have mentioned don't go there if you're in a hurry. This place is more for those that enjoy fresh coffee and have around 45 - 60 minutes to enjoy the quality of Benedict's in a quaint atmosphere at a Parisian pace.    If you love breakfast, don't miss out on this hidden restaurant gem."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp.  Was pleasantly surprised.  People weren't kidding when they said seating is limited.  Wow.  No customers were there when we arrived at 9:30am on Sunday.  Waiter said we just missed the rush.    I had the \"Benedict\" Benedict and my hubby had the American breakfast.  Wow were both good!  The tarragon biscuit that my bene was in was fantastic.  Everything was spot on.  Will retun!"}
{"text":"I've debated this review for awhile now, since the decor is great, the idea is excellent and the food was good. However, throughout our entire meal we listened to server complain to a table that was seated by someone we assumed was her friend.   She complained about how customers ask what they offer in the pastry case, and what kinds of teas they have, and that they always as her to go back and get this sauce or extra thing, etc, etc. She wasn't quiet about it at any point, and given the fact that this place seated maybe eight, you couldn't not hear it. It really turned off the whole experience and made us afraid to ask about anything in the restaurant even though it was our first time there!   Other than that - be ready to wait for a table, since this place is small and there are a limited number of tables. They have a pastry case up front, but it can be hard to see all the options with people seated at the tables off to that side.   The other waitress that was there was friendly and helpful, so that was a plus.   Overall: B- Cute decor and good food probably won't be enough to pull us back here since we didn't feel welcome or comfortable asking about anything."}
{"text":"Update: my husband came over this morning to order breakfast to go. I got the California Benedict and the iced white chocolate peppermint latte. Both were not good! Not the same flavor that what I remember when we dined in several months ago. I don't think we will ever come back! The prices are a little on the high side so definitely not worth it.  Original: We had breakfast here this morning and it was pretty darn good!!! The restaurant is tiny, they are only open on the weekends, and the prices are on the high side. Hubby decided to order the California Benedict and I ordered the Bread Pudding waffle. Both were fabulous!  I also ordered an iced white chocolate peppermint latte and that too was delicious. We will be back again. They have a Yelp deal and I will probably take advantage of it because of the high prices. Our bill was around $30."}
{"text":"So when my party and I arrived here, we noticed how tiny the place was (not a bad thing), just a little advice to those who haven't been here don't bring a party of 6+ because this place is too tiny for that. However, it is a cute little place! We were greeted with smiles by the owner and her daughter (who is the spittin image of her mom) and were thoroughly explained the menu. The owner gave us some pastries on the house to try, a bear claw, which was delicious! I had the breakfast sandwich and my husband had the breakfast burrito. My egg sandwich was really good and the bread was delicious, however my husband was not impressed with his burrito. I even tried a bite and wasn't impressed. Overall this is a cute little family ran place with great pastries and good breakfast but is just a little too much of a drive for us to make a second trip."}
{"text":"the menu selection isn't very big but the food tastes great... the place itself is very small... not good for big groups but its fine for just a couple of you... there is seating outside. i get the eggs Benedict every time... its not the best i have had but its pretty close... I'm not a big fan of the biscuit so that's why its not the best for me. they offer catering however never tried it out. we usually go for breakfast on Saturday's so never tried any of their sandwiches since we are in the mood for breakfast"}
{"text":"great quaint little setup.  food and service were great. enjoyed the personal interaction and food tasted great. will be making it a monthly trip with the wife :)"}
{"text":"Great food, very small place.  Considering size, service could be improved!"}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem for breakfast, brunch or lunch.  Staff was very helpful and friendly and the prices were great.  Can't say enough good things about this place, just wished I had found it sooner."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is great and the service is unparalleled.  Its a cute little hole in the wall with a boutique cafe feel. Since it was our first time they brought muffins and scones on the house just for us to try - as if having one of the best benedicts in town wasn't enough. Definitely recommend stopping in if it's just for a coffee or breakfast."}
{"text":"Very cute authentic place. Not a lot of room to sit BUT the staff is incredibly friendly and the food is delicious. I love their iced lattes and waffles. The breakfast sandwich with the amazing pesto is fabulous too. I keep coming back because the food is consistently good and the staff is super sweet!"}
{"text":"It's a very tiny, cute little cafe with great and friendly staff.  The omelet was fluffy and delicious with the perfect cut sized ingredients.  The portions were generous and our lattes were really good.  Our breakfast burrito was huge and was good.  Like other viewers wrote, menu is very limited and I actually wanted crepes but they didn't have it."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to have a dessert platter from Benedict's at an event I was at in Scottsdale.  The chocolate chip cookies were incredible, and I would have the brownie-like chocolate cake every night if my pants had an elastic waist."}
{"text":"This is a very small place with excellent food. My extraordinarily picky wife commented that this is the only place she's had a veggie omelet that had perfectly seasoned vegetables. We continue our trend of finding awesome places far from home."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was very slow.  It took 40 minutes to get scrambled eggs, potatoes and toast ... And the eggs were slightly above luke warm so they were sitting back there for awhile.  However, the food did taste good."}
{"text":"This place might seem like a little hole next to a gas station, and it is. BUT, the menu is fresh, different and most importantly delicious! Place is clean, staff is super friendly and hospitable. We tried the waffles and croque-Monsieur and it was fabulous. Try their French roast coffee and coconut macaroons if you're in the mood for a lite fare."}
{"text":"I've been turned away 2 out of 3 times I've been there so I've since given up on going back. First time they said their kitchen was broken, despite there being another couple sitting and eating. Second time I tried to go with a few girlfriends and again we were turned away. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp because of a Yelp deal.  Went there on a Tuesday and they were closed.  Disappointed but returned on the weekend when they're open.  Delicious food, and found out they do catering which is why they are closed weekdays.  Would highly recommend them.  Food is delicious and customer service is great!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. And that was last summer. The food was good but not overly exceptional. I thought the prices were a little bit high for what you received. It was quaint and cute, though the eating area is quite small and usually have to wait for a table or sit outside which is not conducive to summer weather. Definitely not the place to go for a large crowd, nice to go for maybe a couple's breakfast or brunch date."}
{"text":"Cute small breakfast place! No wait when we got there. It was really good. I got the quiche and my wife got one of the benedicts (california i think).   The quiche was good, I really liked the benedict though. The benedict actually is predominant in my mind more than my quiche. Anyways. If you want to know if i'd be back.. definitely would be. Its a cute place to go grab a coffee, and have breakfast/brunch with a SMALL group of friends.   It's worth waiting for, and if you can't wait order to go. Problem solved :)"}
{"text":"This small, quaint and spectacular cafe is literally right across the street from us.  All it took was that first visit for it to become one of our faves and Sunday morning rituals.  Atmosphere and decor is very small and cozy, resembling a cafe or B&B in New England along Cape Cod or Nantucket.  Everything we have chosen from the menu is delicious, reminding us of our roots back east of comfort food with a gourmet twist.  If you like eggs benedict you have to try it.  The tarragon biscut and hollondaise makes it the best we've ever had!  The mocha latte is also divine with a good whollop of homemade whipped cream for a topper!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe, pretty small, 4 or so tables inside and a few outside on patio. I'm a huge eggs Benedict fan, they serve it on a muffin (not English muffin) which was a little weird. The egg, ham, and Hollandaise was yummy though. I would go back, but wouldn't order the eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"We appeared after hiking nearby.  A very small eatery which seems to have catering as its mainstay biz.  Fast & friendly order taking; we waited outside for Arizona & Florence benedicts to arrive.  Fresh poached/basted eggs, yum seasonings and biscuits.  We will return!"}
{"text":"Nice folks but too small and most importantly the food was eh. Super salty biscuit on the benedict with cold potatoes. Also you get charged for coffee refills so make sure you don't get another cup at $2 a pop!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that exists because people like us support local businesses.   I was driving along looking for a different restaurant for breakfast when I spotted Benedict's at the intersection. My brain and stomach decided this was the spot. And once again, my instincts were correct.   This place has been around for 10 years or so in the catering realm and only a few years with the little storefront restaurant. They make everything from scratch. And while they have a very limited breakfast menu (homemade quiche, omelets, croissant sandwich, oatmeal and one or two other things) I can only tell you that the coffee cake is very good warm and the croissant sandwich rocks.   I happened to roll in when they were baking some fresh croissants. So when I learned that, I decided to wait the 15 minutes for the croissant. I sipped on some wonderful Mexican coffee that I wanted to swim in it was so good.   Finally, the sandwich was ready. Two fluffy, scrambled eggs, chefs, roasted tomato, bacon (which I had the first day and sausage the second day) and home made pesto sauce. Outstandingly crunch, fluffy and tastilicious that I honestly did not want the sandwich eating to end. But it did. And you better believe I scraped up every little bit of flaky croissant goodness that was left on the plate.   Once again, this is a place that I will return to when I come back to Phoenix next year for my week or so of work.   And if you are a local in Phoenix, get these guys to cater your affair. You'd be a superstar."}
{"text":"Wow!  Amazing hidden gem!! French everything!  Service was excellent and food was out of this world!! We went there for a quick breakfast and we couldn't believe how delicious the food was!!  I ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich and the croissant was so flakey!! My brother ordered the eggs benedict with chorizo and corn bread and he was in love with it!!"}
{"text":"The service was splendid, but my toast was slightly burnt. However I did like the crepe it was a winner. Ciao!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a very long time. With only weekend hours available it's been very hard for me to make it. But on this Sunday, I had some free time and pulled up my bookmarks looking for a good breakfast place.    I am glad I tried it. I ordered pancakes, which is my go to breakfast. But at the last minute I decided to also get an omelette BLT. Be able to use one of my favorite sandwiches but most the time it's just plain bread/bacon, and not worth it.   In this case it was absolutely worth it! The BLT it was simply delicious. I am very glad I ordered it and will come back again just for the sandwich.   All in all a great experience and I would recommend this place; it's a cute shop with a warm atmosphere. The staff was a little disoriented and the service was slow but everyone was very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Quaint little French cafe with indoor and and outdoor cafe eating, you feel like you are in Paris. Kelsey was our server, she was darling. Hubby and I both ordered eggs benedict, hince the name, it was really delicious. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great California Benedict and great service plus good coffee!   We also tried 3 desserts which were amazing...yes 3 don't judge me...lol...chocolate chip cookie/bread pudding/sour cream cake...all good  We will definitely come back. It's in a gas station plaza but don't be fooled it's homemade goodness."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a decent new breakfast place to try in the area. Naturally, we took to yelp! Benedict's had great reviews and we thought to give them a try. We were not disappointed! We were surprised to see how small the establishment was when there was nearly 200 reviews so far. When you walk in, there are a few tall bar-like tables on one side and a few bistro-like tables on the other with an order counter in the center. They also have a few patio seating tables outside in the shade. After taking a look at their simplistic menu, we placed our order. My husband, a food fanatic and self proclaimed critic (lol), ordered the classic Benedict and I had Challa French toast and green tea. Our food came out as quick as one would normally expect. There were two other parties there at the time. The flavor and quality of the food was fantastic! Even though the portions didn't seem large, we both got full. The French toast was easily one of the best I've ever had. My husband said his Benedict was very well prepared and the hollandaise was excellent.  The only reason I'm not choosing to give this review 5 stars is due to the size of the cafe and their seating. The inside dining area is about the size of large master bedroom with seating for about 16 people which would feel rather cramped if every table was full. The tables have barely enough space for two plates and drinks unless it is nice enough to sit outside.   However, the atmosphere and music was very quaint and cozy. It gave the feel as if you were in a small town at a cute little family owned cafe. Aside from an excellent breakfast menu they offer coffees, teas, and an assortment of pastries. And they cater! A great place for a cute, quiet breakfast or to chat with a friend over coffee and scones."}
{"text":"Good food, nice place, extremely small!  The food was terrific and home-made & just-made, but with enough of a twist in recipes and presentation that you it's worth it.  The coffee is relish, too. Heading to use the restroom will take you through the kitchen and that was immaculately clean."}
{"text":"Pluses:  good egg Benedicts, though one was overcooked so the poached egg was dry, and the tarragon biscuit was over salted.  Minuses:  the croissant egg sandwich was cold...appeared to have been the first of four dishes cooked and then left standing to cool off.  More important, the service was terrible.  We ordered a large coffee and cocoa when we first arrived, on a quiet Sunday morning with only a couple tables occupied, and it didn't arrive even 20 minutes later, after our food had been served.  When we complained, after a few minutes the waitress (an older gray haired woman, not sure if it was the owner, since she had a bit of an attitude), came back and asked us to remind her if we had ordered a large or small coffee.  We told her we had ordered (and prepaid for) a large.  Some minutes later still, the younger waitress came by with a SMALL coffee.   Then, after we cancelled the coffee and the cocoa, since we had already eaten our meal, and still had not received either of the drinks we hard ordered a half hour earlier, we didn't get a receipt for the credit.  When I went up to the counter to ask for the receipt, the younger waitress (dark hair) said she didn't know how to print one out on their system.  I had to show her how myself...even though it was very obvious from the payment system they were using (Square).  Bottom line:  forgetful and incompetent service."}
{"text":"This was a little place, much smaller than expected. Luckily, we went when it was not busy at all. We had trouble choosing what to eat for breakfast, we ended up splitting three entrees so we could taste all three. They were all good. We even took some desserts to go when we left. It is more expensive than I would spend for breakfast everyday but I definitely want to go back for brunch sometime."}
{"text":"Tiny in size but big on quality. We really enjoy Benedict's (my wife and I) and like the small, cozy space.  It's so much better than the breakfast factories around us. Of course, order any of the benedicts, they are fabulous."}
{"text":"To sum up Benedict's in a word: limited. The menu. The seating. The portions. The pre-mixed breakfast burrito filling that can't be altered to order. The irony that eggs benedict isn't on the weekday menu. Because of this I'm limiting Benedict's to a single star.  Response to Owner: Here's the rub Dawn. During my experience at Benedict's I asked that my burrito come sans onions and the response from an employee was \"I'm sorry, we're not able to do that\". So either your employees are misinformed, I was lied to, or you're calling me a liar. I'd love to know which one Dawn. At any rate, I'm sure your cafe does fine in Scottsdale, but living here in the Choice City we simply have different standards. Thanks for the shamelessly self promoting comment anyway. All the best."}
{"text":"When you find a hidden gem like this, it's hard to want to tell anyone else about it because you want all the deliciousness to yourself! But after coming here for a few months now, I wanted to give them a top notch review for their awesome customer service and warm atmosphere.  The dining space is small, so prepare to either squeeze inside or sit outside. I like the fact that it's intimate although if they are able to expand their space, that would be a smart move on their part.  The best part of this place for me is their coffee. They get it locally roasted from Passport Coffee in Scottsdale and it is some of the best coffee I've ever had! Mexicana roast...so freakin delicious! You'll just have to try it for yourself to see what I mean. It makes other coffee taste bad it's that amazing!  The food is also pretty good, I've had their croissant sandwich, challah sandwich, parfait, and oatmeal. The pesto they use on the sandwiches is top notch and adds a great flavor boost. I'd stay away from their side order of potatoes, however, because they often taste like they were cooked several hours ago and come out lukewarm and mushy (and not in a good way). That's the only thing I've eaten here that I don't thoroughly enjoy.  Overall, I keep coming back here for the delicious breakfast sandwiches, great customer service, and amazing coffee, and despite the cramped dining area and lackluster potato game, I still give this a full five star rating. Benedict's rocks!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visit Benedict's every weekend for their delicious breakfast. Their breakfast burritos and crepes are our two favorite dishes. Their baked goods are AMAZING as well! Their coconut macaroons are my new favorite dessert item. On top of their great food, they have fabulous service as well. Dawn is always welcoming and Karen is always sweet and thoughtful. This is a great place to go for a weekend food outing."}
{"text":"Had the frittata special for breakfast today with a side of potatoes. Delicious!!! My favorite post-bike ride breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This little cafe type place was the perfect breakfast spot! The food is delicious! I got the oatmeal and side potatoes. So yummy!! I will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to go and get brunch. It's a little far from my house but whenever I go hiking with my friends this is a usual place for us to end up. I always go for the eggs Benedict with the smoked salmon. I absolutely LOVE it. My friends have gotten the omelets and the challah French toast which are both delicious as well. They also have a Yelp deal which is great. The portions are huge and I always leave completely stuffed and just want to go home and sit on my couch. The girls who have taken our order are also sweet as well.   My only complaint is that the seating is super super limited. I think that there are 4 or 5 inside tables so if there are a lot of people there it's hard to find a seat and I always feel awkward hovering over other people as they eat. They have a couple tables outside but with the colder weather we have had it not always enjoyable to sit out there.  That is the only reason I would take a star off. Hopefully at so  point they can move into a larger location and this won't be an issue."}
{"text":"Very small but the food is good and I love the coffee they use"}
{"text":"Great local diner, Great service. Food came out fast even though the place was packed. Dining area was tight. Reminded me of the cruise. But the good news is that I loved my cruise. neighborhood hang out and tourist, this is a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Who let this fantastic local business into Chainland?  Honestly, I think the City of Phoenix zoning commission must've mistakenly thought Benedict's Cafe was going into CenPho when they approved their app; not Reach 11-ish.  Don't let the exterior fool you - walk inside that tiny space in the strip center anchored by Circle K and you'll immediately be transported to someplace altogether different.  So far we've tried the salads and sandwiches (tuna and chicken curry), and all have been better than excellent and made with the freshest of ingredients.  We usually get takeout, but they also have a couple of tables where we've seen people being served.  Staff looks to be all family, and are so friendly and helpful.  An update is in order here, though, because I have to try their breakfast.  They serve eggs benedict and crepes on Saturday and Sunday, and they look amazing.  Benedict's is a perfect lunch spot.  I'm saving that 5th star for what looks like will be an excellent breakfast too."}
{"text":"Quite yummy. Nice small place to have some breakfast."}
{"text":"Meh, was ok.  My h ordered the Arizona Benedict there was only meat on half..I don't know why.  I had the burrito and it was good but they only give you about a tablespoon of salsa.  Iced coffee was really good.  My h got really sick after we ate here...not sure if it was due to his meal but, we probably won't go back just in case unless it's for beverage or pastry because those looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new little \"local business\" breakfast place on the way to Barrett Jackson.  Found this on Yelp.  The location is tucked away in a business park - but what a fantastic find! The food was amazing.  They were happy to accommodate 'sauce on the side' and 'dry toast' etc.  Lots of water and juice/coffee refills.  Menu isn't huge but everything was extremely FLAVORFUL.  Would definitely return.  Our waitress \"Kaylee\" (sp??) was delightful.  Super friendly.  Busy - definitely a  local spot - but we were treated just as well as the \"familiars\" - would ABSOLUTELY return to support this small business over the large chain breakfast joints.  Great Job guys!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype here is about.. The decor is cute but small...I  think going when it was only 50 degrees outside didn't help my experience- the place is very small and no table escapes the breeze when the door opens...Its not clear when you walk in if they will take your order but after sitting for 5 minutes it was apparent that we needed to order at the counter...If you are a coffee person like I am, this isn't the place for that - milk options are whole milk or almond milk- nothing else- and though they have white peppermint mocha listed on their large specialty board, they were out- which was a disappointment for my husband. I ordered the berry crepes which were ok- the crepe itself was cold- and I mean refrigerated cold- so I'm not sure if they buy them pre-made or if they make ahead and store in the refrigerator- but either way, a little disappointed that they weren't made fresh to order...Winter isn't berry season so the blueberries were hard and tasteless-I did however, like the cream they were in- It is a whipped cream- not a vanilla custard cream you may find in other crepes. My husband had a Lox Benedict that he said was just ok...I'm not sure we would return- it's just ok and nothing special...I don't even think there's a restroom it's so small"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while checking my maps for a close place to get breakfast and boy I am glad! It is pretty small, I think it only has 4 tables. And it is only open weekends which is unfortunate because the food was really good. I tried the florentine benedict and it was amazing! The hollandaise was silky. I will definitely be back and would recommend it."}
{"text":"My first time visit. Very disappointed by the service and the food. I considered the yelp reviews and then decided to visit this place. It's overrated. I like how small and cute cafe it is but definitely not the food. Over priced and not worth it.  I ordered just a plain omelette and coffee. I've never had such an omelette,  so soggy and looked like uncooked. Potatoes too oily and burnt. I tried telling the server that omlette is uncooked and i can't eat. Didn't seem to work. I left the entire thing and walked out of the place. Not gonna visit again ! Paid for the food ,  yet left me starving."}
{"text":"Left the movies and was hungry, looked for somewhere nearby new via Yelp so I stopped by Benedict's .  Small cafe and catering shop.  Inside seats maybe 12 people,  outside seats about another 10-12. Ordered the #1 which was their Eggs Benedict and since I checked in on Yelp I received a free Ice Tea.  It was fresh brewed so I did have to ask for more ice as when it was served there was very little ice left in the take-a-way plastic cup.   My Benedict was good.  I've only had them once before at St Francis in Phx.  These came served over a nicely crunchy tarragon biscuit and I chose potatoes as a side.   I think this style of potatoes is known as home fries? Or country potatoes.  Overall I enjoyed my dish.  I don't live anywhere near here so it'll probably just be a one time stop.  But If I ever am in this area again I may pop in."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast place. Very small though (I think they do most of their work catering). I had the breakfast burrito and a cinnamon roll with coffee and it satisfied. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"After walking in, I wanted to be able to give more than 3 stars, I really did - it's a cute, clean but TINY place that completely belies the strip mall location.  The good: My fresh berry crepes were wonderful!  Two crepes, stuffed full and topped with a night light crème fraîche - and the berries truly were fresh - delectable!  My wife enjoyed the pancakes, though they were not especially notable beyond that - good size, and done as expected.  The cramped: I did mention this place was tiny, right?  Yeah, we were squeezed in to a table next to a hutch that had the silent radio and cookbooks and a little display.  The radio was turned on a little after we got there, which did warm up the place a bit, but couldn't cover that we were literally twisting to stay in our seats and not bump our neighbors while eating.  It will likely get better if they can get a couple tables outside as the temps drop, but for now, I'll skip if there's not elbow room.  The place does have some charm, and I'll be back to see how it matures, and to try the eponymous dish."}
{"text":"its a conditional 4, the breakfast burrito was good (recommended 4/5), not huge -- the coffee was good -- egg sandwich was 3/5. its a small store front  located in a small shopping center with a gas station on the corner, and they have 3 small outside tables and 3ish inside"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend at Benedict's Cafe today and was very impressed. Right away when you walk in, it feels homey and welcoming. I had the tuna salad and a peach mango tea - both were incredible. I'd highly recommend this little gem! And they cater, too.... I'll definitely be keeping them in mind for any events I may have in the future!"}
{"text":"Really sweet little cafe with a delightful and interesting menu. I tried the croque monsieur, and the apples and fig jam really made it sing.  My husband ordered the Florentine Benedict and really enjoyed it, especially the tarragon biscuit which was nice and flaky. The fresh fruit was indeed fresh, and included a variety of berries which was nice. We liked their coffee as well, a pleasant meal all around."}
{"text":"Charming little place in a Circle K parking lot but don't let that fool you. Crepes and Benedict were delicious. However, there is really no room to eat but outside, and it will be way too hot for that very soon."}
{"text":"North Scottsdale is not a place known for its unique cafes and sense of community. In a city where big chain restaurants dominate the dining scene with mediocre food and impersonal service, small cafes like Benedict's are all-too-often overlooked. Other reviews have said it before, and I'll reiterate it: Benedict's is the absolute epitome of a diamond in the rough.  I saw Benedict's listed on Yelp as being a cafe where I could grab brunch and coffee on my free weekend days. My first impression was that it was really small and personal, which I liked. It was tucked away next to a gas station in a rather cheap-looking row of shops with royal blue awnings. The first time I went there, I kept it simple: breakfast burrito with bacon and a french roast coffee. The eggs were freshly scrambled, the bacon was crisp and flavorful, and the coffee was freshly brewed and a perfect temperature.  I've been back several times since, over the weekends and have tried their three cheese & herb omelet and the croissant sandwich, both of which were really good and really flavorful.  The staff is what really makes this place worthy of 5 stars in my eyes. Every time I've been back, I swear they've gotten friendlier. It's one of those places where, if you go in more than twice, they'll recognize you. I haven't met the owner yet, but I've chatted with a couple of their other employees (I believe their names were Barbara and Callie) and every time, I am greeted like family. They go out of their way to make conversation and make you feel at home. I'm a fairly shy guy and when I go to Benedict's, I feel a little less shy because of how friendly everyone is there. When I go into Benedict's after not going in for a couple weeks, they've told me (on several occasions), \"we haven't seen you in a while!\" That, my friends, is what great service looks like.  I hope that Benedict's can prosper and grow in a corporatized city like North Scottsdale. I hope that more folks in the Scottsdale area will give Benedict's a chance. It's a great little cafe and I will continue going back, as long as I live here."}
{"text":"I had the California Benedict and it was cold, without flavor.. The roasted potatoes were so salty, almost impossible to eat. The blueberry muffins looked amazing but tasting them was another experience :( not what I was expecting. The place looks good , the ambience is nice too. But the food, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast/brunch spot! I went there with my boyfriend and he had the chorizo scramble and it was delicious! But the star of the show was my basil pesto breakfast croissant sandwich...out of this world with flavor! The pesto and parmesan took it to another level. I will definitely be going back!   Ps- The peach green tea is superb!"}
{"text":"Since we are new to the Phoenix area, we have been exploring. New restaurants. We decided to give Benedict's a try.    The food for me was great.  I had the chorizo scramble which was very good  My wife had a croissant sandwich which pretty much fell apart on her upon her first bite.  It tasted good but was too messy for her tastes  The cafe is VERY intimate.  I did not mind it but my wife was a bit uncomfortable.  Prices were comparable to the area and the service was good."}
{"text":"Mothers Day 2015 was definitely not up to expectations.  Visited on a quiet Saturday noontime and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast. We returned on a Sunday a couple of weeks thereafter and although it was busy, we found a table in this small 15 seat space.  Our orders were delayed, the staff messed our drink order up, and we were not served our drinks until we asked for them, 20 minutes after we ordered them.   The owner offered no acknowledgement until we asked for our order, even avoided eye contact.  NOT the way to go for a small family business.   The quality of goods is superb, but they are clearly ill equipped to handle a busy spurt.   I will return, but not during a busy time."}
{"text":"Walked for the 1st time and the crew were smiling and so friendly. We ordered and sat down. The customers were lined up to Oder their favorites. Most knew what they wanted.  Pastries made there fresh. They looked \"delish\" Our breakfast food was so good.  Little place. A great hideaway. Open only weekends."}
{"text":"I never would have expected this place to be as good as it was. As a visiting Yelper from Kansas City, I rely on my brethren to suggest good food, drink, and entertainment. This recommendation was by far one of the best I've ever experienced.   Staying nearby and not wanting hotel food for breakfast, we ventured out looking for a solid meal for us and our little one. I'm so glad we stumbled upon Benedict's, a hole in the wall on Bell Rd that looks like it might have once housed a dry cleaners. Menu items were limited but all sounded terrific. I settled on the breakfast burrito, a regular benedict for my wife, and a pastry for our son.  I had some serious food envy of my wife's plate, a perfect concoction of eggs and hollandaise resting peacefully on top of a flaky biscuit. My regular coffee was \"meh\" but the Mexican coffee was excellent. The atmosphere was totally chill and things really starting picking up as we ate. Servers were attentive and very friendly.   We did notice another table missing some food items after they ordered and another table loudly cursing up a storm behind us. These don't detract from my review, but were noticeable enough to make things interesting.   We'll definitely return when back in Scottsdale. If you blink you might miss this gem. It was well worth taking a chance on a sunny Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Sunday 11/15/2015 I was treating a friend to brunch at Benedict's a quaint cozy place and I have to say it was horrifying. I was so embarrassed! I was speechless. We ordered the California Benedict and the Quiche. The food was cold. The ham and tomatoes seemed to be almost frozen. The avocado was brown and cold - nothing seem fresh. My girlfriend was sweet enough to say it's ok. I just couldn't eat or even think of serving food like this. I told her Benedict's carters and their food is normally fresh. I'm shocked that Benedict's has received great reviews in the past. I told one of the employees the food was cold - if they freeze it - then bake it - answer No. I decided to just try the veggie omelet with ham and my girlfriend ordered the french toast. It was awful! the eggs were way over cooked and brown. The cook forgot the ham - veggies well it was only mushrooms, a couple of zucchinis. Did I mention all the mushrooms and zucchinis were charcol burned! The french toast came out way after I was done eating. I wanted to buy Mexican coffee grinds (bag) to go but they were completely out. I ordered the chocolate croissants but they were out. I didn't really have a choice of desserts since they were out. The manager at Benedict's that Sunday was not doing a very good job of running the place. They need to hire cooks, chefs, be organized, stay stocked up, and be better prepared to be open to the public."}
{"text":"Usually I would just drive on by since it's hidden in a strip mall with a gas station and a dry cleaner but oh I'm so happy we didn't. The menu keeps to the basics - a few benedict's, omelets and of course a breakfast burrito and in keeping it short they really do a delicious job on what they focus on. I love the cheese and herb omelet. The potatoes are well spiced. The nice thing about this place is portions are small so you don't leave breakfast hating yourself for the rest of the day.   Only drawback- there's only ~5 inside tables  but if you find yourself waiting, it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"We were in town for a wedding and wanted to find a small place to visit and eat some amazing food.  We found Benedict's through a Yelp search.  The iced coffee is good.  The breakfast potatoes were A-mazing! We both ordered the lox Benedict.  Absolutely yummy in my tummy.  The service was great.  The bakery chef came out and offered us samples.  Everything tastes great and they are so nice here.  They also offer cooking classes.  There are only about four to five tables, so be sure to go early or call them for availability.  I do believe they mainly focus on catering."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Took advantage of yelp deals.  Solid and quick, smallish breakfast cafe. Friendly staff and great service.  Outdoor seating, tho in a strip mall parking lot (this might be standard in Scottsdale, not sure).  My group loved the cheesy omelet and the California benedict, and also enjoyed the eggs and lox and the croissant sandwich.  I noticed that many of the egg dishes were served on a very basic, average sourdough bread.  With a bakery/kitchen in back, why not serve them on croissants or biscuits?"}
{"text":"Rarely do I find the inspiration to write a review but this place definitely inspired me. I typically don't expect a lot of flavor from most breakfast places - it's usually filling and not much in taste. We had the Benedict's Benedict and the French toast. The Benedict was served on a biscuit instead of muffin which was different but excellent. The french toast was excellent as well and the country potatoes which I'm almost never a fan of where spicy and full of taste. This is a true gem in the -254 despite its modest strip mall appearance."}
{"text":"Just had the eggs benedict and a veggie omelet. Eggs benedict had absolutely no flavor, the muffin it was on was hard as a rock. The potatoes were old and cold. The omelet was for a two year old.  We're  headed home now to make something to eat. Wish we'd done that in the first place."}
{"text":"I look forward to weekends and Benedicts, everything on the menu is amazing! Don't even get me started on the Mexican coffee, can't find better coffee in the valley!"}
{"text":"I went to Benedict's Cafe today with a friend when we were in search of a good place for brunch in North Phoenix. After seeing the latest article in Phoenix Magazine where it was mentioned as one of the top 369 delicious meals under $10 we thought we'd check it out.   The place is super small in a CircleK strip mall. Really only seats 10 people inside. You have to order at a counter.   Naturally, after reading the article we both ordered the weekend special - eggs Benedict on a tarragon biscuit with country potatoes.   Shortly after we sat down the girl from the counter said they ran out of potatoes that were supposed to come with our dish. So, we each got a small side of fruit salad and 1 order of sourdough toast instead. One other guy at the next table had to select a different side too.   But we were still optimistic the eggs Benedict would be good.  However, we were pretty disappointed. Although it was an edible dish it wouldn't bring either of us back. The eggs were over cooked, the hollandaise sauce was far too lemony and the tarragon biscuits, although very flavorful, were very hard and dry- especially around the edges.   I ate all of mine (because I was starving) but my friend (whose eggs were cooked even more than mine) complained and they attempted to fix them. Instead of re-doing the presentation, they just re-did one of the eggs - which of course now was slightly undercooked with runny translucent egg white.   So, sad to say i don't think I will be back. But hopefully they can step things up after the Phoenix Magazine article!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the JW Marriott a few miles away and came ere for my birthday breakfast. Food was amazing. I ordered the AZ bene and the BF got the berry crepes. So good and so fresh. The bene had a delicious chorizo patty, corn cake and avocado cream sauce.  I wish we lived closer so we could go there more often. Highly recommended.  It is in a strip mall, small store front and limited seating, but we went around 10:30 on a Saturday and there was no wait. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Being a yelper.. I found this place on yelp.. It  had quite a few reviews so I thought we'd give it a try on this sunny Sunday morn. Trying to avoid large crowds and literally this was the perfect spot! This place couldn't have been any smaller.. Worry none about the size. This food is big on taste. Everything was made fresh the OJ was soo sweet, my husband said it was the best coffee he'd ever had.. I had the Challah French Toast I asked for a side of peanut butter and it came with fresh strawberries.  Needless to say I over raved and halfway through my meal hubby and I switched plates.. so I got to enjoy the sausage omlet as well.  I hope the owners of this place expand soon because the only problem I can see is not having proper accommodations to host the patrons.   The wait staff was amazing and if I lived in Scottsdale I'd be here every weekend. I'd recommend this quaint little place for sure:) Yummy for the tummy.."}
{"text":"This neighborhood cafe lives up to it's reputation. I think we've found our new weekend breakfast spot! The coffee is good, the food is great,  and the cozy feel and personal touch make you want to be a regular. We will be working our way through the menu, for sure. So far, the crepes are light and delicious, the Mexican iced coffee is refreshing, and my husband was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of the prosciutto in the California Benedict. Definitely worth waiting for a table if necessary...even an outside table!"}
{"text":"Consistency eludes this place.  First two trips were pretty good.  My third and final trip was so awful I will never return.  When you walk in you don't know whether to order at the front, seat yourself, wait to be seated?  The tarragon biscuits are awesome except some are awesome and some are crackers.  My partner had a creamy beautiful hollandaise and mine was a clumpy coagulated mess.  Emailed the owner...nothing.  Good luck with the catering business."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch when I was visiting my son and from the looks of it outside I was not expecting much. What a pleasant surprise!  This is a jewel of a breakfast/brunch spot. The eggs are great, served with potatoes, and my son told me the coffee was really good. There are fresh pastries and yogurt parfait made with thick, Greek-style, creamy yogurt. Will definitely come back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Not quite the experience I had the first time... A little disappointed  by...well pretty much everything. Ordered my food no problem, friendly staff as usual. Ordered the regular eggs Benedict, my all time favorite breakfast, everywhere I go, if this is on the menu, let me have it! It came with potatoes I ordered extra crispy. Also asked for water. Sat down and waited for my water and it never came until I asked again for it 15 minutes later. My food came out about 20 minutes from ordering, not bad at all. First thing I noticed was one of my poached eggs were already broke, that's a big no no... Second egg was over cooked, the yolk was solid. Then the potatoes were not crispy at all. Not really what I was expecting from a place called Benedicts that I would usually highly recommend. I sat by the register, small table in the corner and not once was I asked how my food was, but I left well fed! The value is just not there for me. They imply a tip when you pay instead of after your meal. I would not have tipped at all... No service, why tip? Oh wait, I already did! Good luck Benedicts, you look like your doing really well, but I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"ATTENTION: they are no longer open for breakfast/brunch. They do serve pastries and coffee, but no more menu items. The woman who told us this morning was very kind but I am sure she could tell we were very disappointed. The staff was always so kind and welcoming.   I hope the owners reconsiders opening back up their brunch."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of eggs Benedict so I was really excited to try this new place. Upon arrival I immediately changed my mind. The place is so small you can barely fit, I felt uncomfortable. To me it looks like more of a coffee shop than a breakfast place. You have to order at the counter and pay right ahead. No problem, but not my style. My roommate is vegan and the only vegan option was the walnut oatmeal. They were out of it. So she had to order 2 roasted potatoes instead. Coffee was good, but you have to get it yourself at the coffee station. My California Benedict looked amazing and it was also fairly tasty. But the bread was too tough, I spent more time trying to cut the bread rather than enjoying it. Will I come back? No. Also cause it's a bit overpriced: $30 dollars for one Benedict, 2 roasted potatoes and 2 coffees I think you guys should represent yourself as a coffee shop rather than \"breakfast and brunch\". Yelp led me wrong on this one."}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems that you try when you're in the area.  The restaurant is a very small store in a little strip mall.  There are maybe 5 tables inside and out making it very limited in space.  Don't being a crowd or you might be standing!  Once you walk in, however, you are greeted with wonderful smells from the bakery and a smiling owner.  The breakfast food is wonderful and I highly suggest going on the weekend and trying their eggs benedict and berry crepes.  Their benedict has homemade tarragon biscuits on the bottom which I love.  The crepes have a very light not too sweet cream and a wonderful berry topping that is refreshing and not overly filling.  We also brought home some scrumptious macaroons and scones that are worth a second visit as well!  In essence, wonderful neighborhood joint worthy of a stop!"}
{"text":"I really wish this was open during the week, their breakfast is AMAZING. I find myself craving this all week long, and then the weekend comes and I'm beyond excited to stuff my face with their local ingredients.   It's a little shop tucked away, you have to keep your eye out for it. They do catering during the week, I've actually had some of their stuff that was catered at an event once. && I could tell it was them that had done the catering. It's little details that they focus on.   I've never met the owner, but the place is run by her best friend. And if you meet her she takes really good care and is super passionate about this pride and joy.   The food, oh the food.... Is just so good! Probably my favorite place in Scottsdale to grab food. We always get different stuff, but it never disappoints so I don't really have a favorite because it's all so good. That just goes to show that this place is awesome. I rate it an A+"}
{"text":"Loving this place. The best Island Curry chicken Sandwich I have ever had, and did I mention the amazing lattes. They only have three flavors, vanilla bean, caramel and Belgium chocolate but they are all homemade in store and for fantastic. I cannot wait to try the crepes I have heard so many good things about them!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, small portions,  and worst of all, poorly made Benedicts. This summarizes the experience I had here with my girlfriend on a Saturday morning.   We ordered a Florentine Benny ($11) and a California Benny ($14). Service was average and it took about 15 min for the food to arrive. That's when things went South. All 4 eggs in our dishes were overcooked to the point of being nearly hard boiled. The hollandaise on top had also begun to break with the oil forming a separate layer on top. Adding insult to injury, the eggs and portions were incredibly tiny - there was literally a single thin slice of prosciutto under each egg in the California Benedict.   Normally I don't go out of my way to write negative reviews, but to be overcharged for a small, poorly executed attempt at an Eggs Benedict in a restaurant named after the dish is beyond disappointing."}
{"text":"This place has a delicious breakfast. I tried the bread pudding waffle and it was one of the best waffles I've ever had in my life. The staff was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Good food. Cute place. The potatoes were 'slightly' undercooked but still good. The grape jelly was delicious.  I want to try their Chicken Salad sandwich so I will for sure go back and try that."}
{"text":"This tiny place has a very \"classy\" feel inside. The music is very relaxing. I recommend calling first to see how busy it is. This place is very small and i think it could get crowded sometimes.  It smells like breakfast on a holiday morning. Service is very good and very friendly. The menu looks awesome. It is a little pricey but this isn't a McDonald's. Everything is mostly under 10 dollars. The french toast is killer. You get two huge pieces of bread with ripe fresh strawberries on them and powder sugar. I gave four stars because my brother got a burrito and said it was just \"ehh\". I recommend it though!"}
