{"text":"Loved this place! Great selection of beers and the pretzel was awesome! Bartenders were very personable and had great suggestions! A must visit!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Scapegoat last time I was in town visiting from SF because I love a good wine bar -- this place did not disappoint.  Great atmosphere and wine selection which I also thought was reasonably priced.  I am still thinking about the cheese plate which was one of the best I have had (and I have had many a cheese plate :) ) nice amount of meat along with the cheese, warm bread and mustard/ dips - definitely recommend getting this to accompany your bottle of vino.  Also everyone working here was so nice, our group was spread out around the bar and we all had excellent service.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and drink selection. Just right for a late night girls night sipping wine and catching up."}
{"text":"Great service mike behind the bar is very knowledgeable about the wines and beers Small personal lounge bartender very nice guy Great atmosphere and service. Great place for couple drinks before dinner or after dinner"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick drink or a gathering of friends!  There is a good selection of beers from the US and wines from around the world."}
{"text":"Cool place where they only serve beer and wine. Staff is very knowledgeable of the beer and wine. Unassuming and a nice place for after work drinks."}
{"text":"I met a girlfriend for happy hour.  it's actually a unique little place very chill it's a smaller place the Decour is really neat the people there and service really good. If you want to go in hang out with friends players cards and chill it's a nice little hang out.  Beer selection is small. The meat/cheese board was sparse and overpriced for what they give you."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Old Town.  The wine list is delicious and the beers are rotating so there's always something new to enjoy.  The food is outstanding (meatballs, hummus, and Caesar are my go to) and the service from Mike and Alexa is always top notch.  I can come here for business, with friends, or alone and always have a great time."}
{"text":"What a great find in Old Town Scottsdale. Beautifully decorated place with great choices for beer and wine. I also like the little snacks on the menu, especially the popcorn. I find this a great place to go on a Saturday afternoon to just hang out after a morning of running around."}
{"text":"This is the best place for a burger.  The patio is so nice and the server was fabulous.  His name is Greg.  We had the pleasure of having him twice.  Great holiday atmosphere.  It was a cool evening and he made sure it was perfect.  Everyone is great there, but he did an outstanding job of getting our food quickly and making sure it was good."}
{"text":"Great selection of wine and beer. Outstanding friendly atmosphere. Definitely coming back again. The GOAT grilled cheese is to die for. Great food too!"}
{"text":"Chill place, good drinks, cool owner. Yelp wants me to write a more insightful review so again...Chill place, good drinks, cool owner."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall place. The staff was great and a decent rotating beer selection.  My wife is a wine drinker and wasn't overly impressed. One chardonnay on the the list.....and way to sweat at that."}
{"text":"Good spot nice owners, great wine list"}
{"text":"Nice new bar in Scottsdale with a great selection of beer, wine and bar snacks. Super cute ambiance inside and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I have to say again how much I love this place.  It's cool and casual, the selections are very, very good and change regularly, and the operators are also cool, classy and superb \"barkeeps\"!  What luck to have such a fabulous place so close to home!"}
{"text":"Holy AMAZING. Tens across the board! My husband and I had the burrata, pretzel and baked sandwich and couldn't get enough. Michael made the experience that much more awesome. Food, beer & wine pairing, sexy atmosphere, and conversation all to freaking die. We were literally planning the next time we could come back, while we ate. Cannot say enough about how delicious everything was!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing you never wanna leave. Clean, amazing service, great music, right on with the beer, wine and ciders! Menu is great for the appetite. Green Flash Alpine always on draft!!!!"}
{"text":"Couple things! 1) New wine list drops tomorrow!! Check. It. Out. 2) Tried the new goat cheese bruschetta tonight... A. MAZING. 3) This establishment is consistently great and live music on Tuesdays!! If you haven't been here yet, you gotta check it out. One of the best establishments in Old Town."}
{"text":"I call this place Sage Goat because Mike, the GM is so wise, friendly and gracious - even when the place is packed. The man is a veritable Magician when it comes to customer service on a busy night. Always a smile, always a good story, always makes you feel special even when the night gets hopping.  I love the wine list and excellent small bites, but I really do come here because Mike is a superb human."}
{"text":"This place is a great, unique addition to old town. Wonderful wine and craft beer selection and a variety of great small plates. The place is really small but that adds to the charm. The service was fantastic as well. Definitely a new favorite in the area."}
{"text":"Small place with big flavors! Great on tap beer selection and chef made nosh. Can't beat the quaint open air space w/high end bar decor. Owner Nick is knowledgeable and easy to talk to."}
{"text":"Cozy, classy, comfortable beer and wine bistro. A nice relief in Old Town. We came late afternoon to escape the heat. To chillax. Done."}
{"text":"Was showing my college friend from Louisiana around Scottsdale,she now lives in the Bay Area. Wanted to stop by here due to the reviews. Looked closed but door was open, a man said we are now closed on Mondays, I said that's fine we can go to another spot. He asked what we were we looking for and I said just a beer before I drop her off at the airport. He, Mike, said well come in and I will pour you a beer. He then opened up the bar...raised the window, moved the stools around, turned on the music and see up the sign. He opened the bar for the day!!  And it quickly filled up and it was a one man show. First class service & definitely a pro. Go there and have fun!! Great spot, cool decor and fantastic service. Over and beyond"}
{"text":"This place is a brand spanking new diamond in the rough. Located in the heart of Old Town, where most bars are playing techno and kicking out 21 year olds for dancing in their own vomit, Scapegoat is quite the opposite.  They only serve beer and wine, which is actually quite nice because it means the atmosphere stays casual and unpretentious. They also have a pretty nice little food menu! It's tiny and has an NYC bar vibe to it, and the owner is also the bartender - pretty cool in my mind. If you're looking for a nice escape from the usual intensity of Old Town, where 30-somethings rule the night, it's a new must."}
{"text":"Awesome new addition to old town! It's nice to finally have a comfortable atmosphere with a great drink menu. It's a small and very friendly bar with delicious snacks, I just hope too many people don't figure out its here!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, great beer, great wine, freaking awesome bartender. Great stop for a quick drink. Wait staff is super nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Tiny overly cramped bar and extremely noisy. I was not impressed by this place whatsoever it was the first time I've been there. I sat at the bar counter and actually had to put plugs in my ears because of the noise level. I ordered a cheese and meat plate and it was actually pretty good for the price. The craft beer selection was minimal. I would probably not go back to this bar because of the fact that it was so small and extremely noisy."}
{"text":"Great little wine and beer bar! Laid back and casual. Good decor and waitstaff. We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer or glass of wine. It's super cozy and the service is great. If you're looking for jager bombs then keep looking, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"On the recommendation of fellow Yelp-ers my hubby and I came here for some Friday night pre-party. We had some of their wine only. The wine list is California heavy, which is great for us! Had a fab blend by Niner Estates and a cab by Seven Falls. Need to come back for my 2nd fave zin by Earthquake! Music kicks a great vibe and the chatter around the tables was lively. I miss my favorite wine shop 4 doors down from my old home, but this place is feelibg right. I coukd easily be a regular here. The small plates food looked great....will come back to try!"}
{"text":"Had a Milestone birthday party for my wife. Chose Scapegoat for the location and size. The venue was perfect the guests enjoyed the large selection of craft beers and wine.   The food was perfect tasty and I overheard more than once \"This is so good\" Many thanks to Mike and his staff as they were attentive and focused on the guests I'd recommend to anyone for Happy Hour to a small gathering"}
{"text":"Nice place.  SMALL & LOUD !  Our party of 3 got seats at the bar.  Only one bartender during happy hour.  He (Mike) was great, but service would most likely have been quicker if he had a back up, as he was tending both the bar and the outer tables.  Felt this limited our opportunity to save some $$ on their happy hour prices.  We ordered 3 appetizers; cracker jax, marinated and cheese balls.  All were good, however I enjoyed the cheese balls the best !  One other note of interest, the font on their menus is quite small and the bar is dark, you may want to change that."}
{"text":"My favorite little place. Cozy and intimate yet relaxed and fun! Love the card games/dominoes available for customers, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Came here for the first time today. It started off great, but 40 minutes after we got here we still didn't receive any service due to a \"scavenger hunt\" or something. Too small of a place that can't prepare for excess customers. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Super hip little place right in the heart of Old Town. Great beers on tap. Didn't try the food but will next time. Jordan was behind the bar and she was excellent, attentive and friendly. Really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim as I was killing time near Old Town.  Tried 'The Goat' on Alexa's recommendation and it clearly deserves its name as the Greatest grilled cheese  Of All Time.  Very tasty.  Beer list was excellent (had a Bell's HopSlam and a McFate Jugo Weiss sour) and Alexa was again spot-on with her suggestions.  It's a small place, but the atmosphere and vibe are great.  Definitively recommended you stop by if you find yourself in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem. We discovered it shortly after it opened because we were looking for a place to have a team offsite with the company that I used to work for. Once we got there we realize how small it was and I was a little concerned. Five minutes later, my opinion changed dramatically! The staff was super friendly, the selection of beers is amazing, and the food is great!  After that I've continued to go there at least once or twice a month for a couple of drinks after work. My advice? Go there in the middle of the week right around 5 PM and stick around for a few hours, get some appetizers, down a few beers, and you can go home feeling happy."}
{"text":"Okay first off - pictures make the place look WAAAYYYY bigger than it actually is.  For a downtown Scottsdale bar you would think it would seat more than 40 but it does not.  That is my ONLY detractor.  We loved the atmosphere and the clientele was friendly and interactive.    It is very nice to come into a new place and be able to have a conversation with the staff (two) and also talk to all the other patrons.  It was a very fun stop during our night."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, music and beer. They have The Bruery which is amazing. Great spot for happy hour or after dinner drink or stop on a bike ride."}
{"text":"The space is nice - good for pairs or groups, conducive to a happy hour, a date, or an evening with friends. Music is a bit loud for good conversation. The drink list of beers and wines has a good variety with options for all tastes. The food menu is almost entirely snacks. We had the cracker jax (peanuts and popcorn with a caramelized crunch - tasty and a generous portion), the burrata (typical burrata, good and enough for two to share), the cheese pretzel (oily and over-baked with an unpleasantly pungent cheese melted on it served beside unappetizing pickled Brussels sprouts), and a steak special (delicious and sufficient for two to share). I'd come back again based on most of the food, except the service was not good. The two servers were borderline unfriendly and inattentive. It took 10 minutes to get one beer, our food came out very slowly and oddly paced, and we had to flag down the servers for any requests despite sitting directly in front of them at the bar. It felt like our presence was an inconvenience and they could not have cared less that we were there."}
{"text":"Came here again yesterday for Happy Hour and was surprised to be practically the only ones in there for a while! Slowly other patrons trickled in. Must be more of a late-night spot. We sat by the open window looking outside. Totally dig the atmosphere! AND, if you check in on Yelp you get $2 off your beer! I highly suggest the Orange Blossom, I'm not even much of a beer drinking and I absolutely love this stuff.  If you're one of those awkward I-don't-know-what-to-do-with-my-hands people (like me), they have a couple games of Jenga to keep you occupied.  Service was A+++, they came over like a million times to check on us. My friend found it almost annoying, but according to my sisters I am an attention whore (I'm not) so I was totally fine with the level of service. Certainly better than the other end of the spectrum. I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, great atmosphere, and fantastic service from the owner himself. It's exciting to see a place like this come to Old Town and give an alternative to all the rowdy options."}
{"text":"I stopped in here while I was waiting for a to-go order from a nearby restaurant and fell in love. Everything impressed me about this place. The menu made my mouth water. The wine was the perfect temperature. Even the one-man band that was playing was the perfect volume. The atmosphere is like a modern 1920's speakeasy with a copper/aluminum touch. I had high expectations due to its reputation on yelp. They were well exceeded.   They have a fantastic beer menu for those that aren't winos. The bartender Mike was very friendly and knowledgeable. His professionalism makes it feels like a 5 star restaurant.   I will definitely be back here soon for a date night or classy girls night out. It's like finding a diamond in the rough of old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Very cool place with a trendy vibe, good food and nice beer & wine selection. The two bartenders were very attentive. My wif e & I split the thai spring rolls (on special that night), which were fantastic. We also split the G.O.A.T, which was amazing and is a regular menu item.  The only negative keeping me from rating it 5 stars is that it is very loud. A table near us was taking loudly and it made it difficult to hear each other. Other reviews have pointed this out so it wasn't a surprise. Otherwise we had a great experience.  We will define go back!"}
{"text":"First time here...Sooo rude!! Went here for dinner and drinks. We open the door and this rude lady comes waving us and shooing us away yelling it was a private party! How about put a sign on the door!!! We have lots of friends and usually come in groups and spend. What the lady should have done was kindly tell us there was a private party in session and she appreciated us stopping by and to please return again. They have for ever lost me and anyone I know as a customer!!! Booo"}
{"text":"I loved this bar.  We hit up Scottsdale for a little anniversary get-away and made a plan to stop in here because of all the great reviews.  I was completely floored to find my absolute favorite wine - ever - listed on the menu, and on happy hour to boot! A hard to find vino, Domaine Saint Vincent - if you like sparkling, and this is on the menu, GET IT.  We ended up being pretty alone at the bar for a while and really enjoyed chatting with Roger, the bartender on duty. Since we settled in at the bar for a bit, we also enjoyed the homemade Cracker Jax corn, which was sweet, salty, and way better than the stuff in the box.  Cool vibe, nice people, quality selection."}
{"text":"Great addition to the area. Solid selection of beer and wine (especially wine by the bottle). The owner happened to be our server and was working very hard at attending to everyone (which I love). I do wish the menu had more specifics (vintage/year), but the owner was very open to this suggestion. Cute interior space as well.   We are from Sonoma, so it's appreciated and so nice to see a good wine bar here in Scottsdale that we can enjoy when visiting. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love Scapegoat, it's MUST when in the Old Town area. The staff is always friendly, the drinks are fantastic and the new food menu is OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS  Perfect little spot to cool off and grab a cold one"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Cozy place. Good wine and beer. No hard liquor. Was here on 4/21/17."}
{"text":"Enjoy a well designed and yummy Farm Salad and a small bar feel. Nice, small simple pleasures here and the food menu is worth exploring. Friendly service."}
{"text":"We stopped in Friday night to grab a drink before dinner and running some errands at the mall.  I absolutely love this gem of a bar - great atmosphere (cozy, but comfortable), amazing service and great beer and wine selection = a winning combination!  This would definitely be our \"go to\" bar if we lived in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. We were late getting started w the babysitter. So where do we go for help in deciding where to eat? Yelp! This place was awesome. Tried cheese puffs, burrata bowl and greatest grilled cheese of all time, The Goat!  Great service! Great food. Cool vibe. Will be back."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this diamond in the rough! Very unassuming from the outside but so modern and inviting inside. Nick, the owner is charming and knowledgable. Great beer selection. Food was amazing. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Gem of a place.  Owner is really friendly and the beer selection is great.  Didn't eat but wanted to.....I was too full from dinner.  I will definitely come back here.  Chill vibe, clean decor."}
{"text":"Loved this place! So cute and quaint. My husband and I were walking around Old Town and stumbled on this place. The wine is good, the cheese plate was tasty and the music on point. Oh and the service was great too!"}
{"text":"Cute little place. Love that they have a couple of nitrous on tap. Snacks were a bit pricey for what they were. But it's Scottsdale I guess."}
{"text":"Ambiance is warm and Romantic. I secluded hideaway perfect for after work, appetizers, or a hot date. A beautiful wine and beer selection and Nick the owner values his patrons..  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This is a nice vet and cozy little contemporary bar.. with good atmosphere and great service and locals.."}
{"text":"Great little bar with a cool ambiance and a range of beers and wines. It was definitely a little gem we stumbled upon."}
{"text":"Great spot to beat the heat, grab an ice cold draft, and hang with the chill crowd and staff."}
{"text":"so... great wine. perfect service from the couple who work at the bar. very nice snacks. good music vibes. its worth the 5 stars"}
{"text":"Great new spot in Old Town for drinks and food. I really enjoy the ambiance, they've done a nice job of making the space comfortable with a modern touch. The staff is knowledge and helpful, especially when it comes to giving drink recommendations. I highly recommend checking it out on Tuesday evenings when they have live music and 50% off bottles of wine."}
{"text":"Stopped in on their 1 year anniversary. It's a small and intimate lounge with a buzzing atmosphere. They only serve beer and wine with a selection of small bites. The menu looked delicious but drinks were all we ordered.   Scapegoat was packed for the celebration but the bartender (Mike) was quick to help get us drinks. He told us about the anniversary and we congratulated him. Mike was knowledgeable on the menu and very friendly.   Great place to take a date or grab drinks pre/post dinner."}
{"text":"Don't be surprised to see so many craft beer options in a tiny restaurant.  Ordered - Hummus: tasted delicious and quantity was kinda less for the price though. Avocado Toast : ditto  Beer : Hefe Paulaner - I guess it's the best Hefe beer I had so far. It's so good, I did 3 extra rounds and I opted same beer.  Ambience is great, Good music. It was kinda crowded when I was here, but that's not a deciding factor to give this place a try. 4 stars coz of the price. I feel it's lil high on the scale for the quantity."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to enjoy prosecccos, beers and wines. They have some fun games and it hasn't been super packed when I've been there and because it's in Old Town it's a great escape from the wildness! We need more of these around town!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot! Had a steak special that was ridiculously cheap and phenomenal! The beer selection was great as well as the wine. The best part....the service was great! Super friendly. Great value. I'd go back anytime. Beware, it's a pretty tiny spot."}
{"text":"If your looking  for variety look no further! I couldn't believe the selection here is amazing!  They have a really cool atmosphere and the service is so so. The best part is that they stay open until midnight! Come on down and join the fun and activities!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night. It was so cute and quaint....ordered a bottle of wine with friends and really enjoyed the atmosphere! I will be going there again for sure. PS. They have CrackerJacks as a small treat!"}
{"text":"Fantastic vibe... terrific service. Tasted samples of some yummy newts and wine. Stayed for the happy hour."}
{"text":"A hidden gem of oldtown. The craft beer and wine bar trend has given rise to tens of such establishments around the valley, however this is a clear standout in the category. Tucked away amongst the southwestern stores and small businesses in oldtown, scapegoat sets a positive tone from the second you walk in. A warm but modern ambiance makes it both a great spot for dates and or just to sit at their wrap around bar and grab a drink after a long day at work.  The General Manager, Mike, who also is the main bartender of the establishment, is of an elite caliber when it comes to his service and knowledge of what it takes to run a successful business. This service has built steady and repeat clientele so you will often see familiar faces and be able to strike up a great conversation even if you venture in here alone.   They also have a fantastic kitchen that exceeds the basic bruschetta type offerings of similar establishments (although they do have that if you want it).  Avocado toast, fresh burrata, and even specials such as a delicious chili rubbed steak make this an option for pre dinner drinks, with the ability to stay around for the full meal.  I highly recommend this for anyone looking to grab a laid back drink and/or food, in a warm and inviting atmosphere, all while receiving some of the best service in town."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance and great selection. I highly recommend for before dinner drinks/apps or post dinner. Open air seating to outside and a tv if you want to watch the game. Give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"This is a super cool little bar just a few steps west of Scottsdale Rd.  The decor is hip and yet comfortable.  The owners are super nice and friendly.  Check out the small plates offerings from their compact menu.  As the name suggests, they have a well thought out wine and craft beer list for libations.  A couple of my favorite craft beers there are the Huss Magic in the Ivy and Lumberyard's Knotty Pine."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting on a road trip. This place has good vibe, delicious wine, small plates of food and friendly server.  My bf and I came here on Oct 14th  Saturday around 6.45pm and it was the perfect amount of people. Although it was tiny inside but wasn't packed. We didn't sit at the bar like we usually do. We loved the music.   Happy hour is from 3pm to 6pm $2 off all draft beer,  + $3 off wine by the glass.  There was a TV at the bar and nice tap & wine selection were plentiful. I think there was around 15 to 18 beers on tap. Snacks/drinks are a little overpriced for what you get but it's Scottsdale I guess evertyhing are expensive there.  We had some drinks but didn't try their food. Overall, an inviting place to hang out. We will probably return when we have a chance."}
{"text":"Had a couple glasses of the Malbec and shared the olives for a Saturday date night. The bartender recommended the Arenya Malbec and it was delicious and the olives went great with the wine. Large pours and lots of olives. It's a small spot but laid out nicely and had a great vibe."}
{"text":"Excellent place with a terrific atmosphere.  Beer and wine selection was really great!  We really enjoyed coming here.   Service was terrific!!!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Found this spot on Yelp and what a find! It's small on the inside so get there early for a seat. Mike takes care of the whole place solo and does a great job at it! The first night we had a great Cabernet out of Washington and cheese puffs with the baked sandwich.crazy awesome. Ended up going back 2 days later just for the cool ambiance."}
{"text":"Stopped in , great wine and craft beer . Nick was so knowledgeable and helpful and friendly !! Must stop for a drink . Nice small plates also !"}
{"text":"My favorite bar in downtown Scottsdale. Great vibe, cool crowd, chill tunes. Interesting beers on tap, some good wines by the glass, creative bar food.  Love the servers - I feel welcomed here.  Owners tell me they are opening up in Downtown Phoenix too. Hopefully it does not dilute our Scottsdale experience too much (pun intended). It's my go-to bar when visiting Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Way to loud, Michael was great nut the noise was louder than expected! Can not imagine if it was lore crowded."}
{"text":"Cute little hidden bar. The environment is fun and great to have a sit down and hang out intimately with your friends. Fun board games and games to play with your friends and have a good laid back time with some good beer and wine"}
{"text":"Lovely service and good service. Their wine selection was superb and the guy behind the bar was really friendly and helped with my choice for the night. I would definitely be coming again"}
{"text":"The sweet and spicy meatballs roasted in a sweet chili glaze are hands down some of the best I've had. They have JUST ENOUGH sauce on them too! Not too much and not too little. And pleaseeeeee don't sleep on the G.O.A.T. Parisian ham with 3 cheeses baked between local breads. My husband LOVED it! The cheese is melted on the inside as well as the out! Comfy atmosphere! The sour beer is a hit!"}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. Great wine and beer selection. Really yummy noms. The staff is super knowledgeable and friendly. Great happy hour.   Thanks everyone keep up the awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in old town. They always have a perfect list of different types of wine and craft beer! The place is intimate and cozy yet hip. It reminds me of a bar in NYC, small space, with brick walls and a big bar. There is usually only one person working (often the GM). Despite it always being busy, whoever is working is always very attentive (even if you are not sitting at the bar). I have always loved everything I have ordered...wine, beer, and their food is all good!"}
{"text":"Cool little Beer & Wine Bar in Old Town. The Cigar City IPA they had on tap was unbelievable. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Great vibe, great beer and wine selection. I would defiantly make this my regular spot."}
{"text":"Quick review to add to the 42 five-star reviews of Scapegoat! This place has outta this world service and selections!  Welcomed and tended to right away. Nice selection of local and other beers as well as a solid wine selection if you're in the mood for wine. We definitely wanted to try the milk stout. I love stouts and all their chocolate coffee goodness but this one, the Lefthand, was heavenly! Served on nitro it's the perfect balance of creamy, dreamy, oh yeeeyyaaahh! So good you make up words lol!  Shared The Goat croque Monsieur - the best! The thing is giant and should be taken seriously.  A fantastic little bar that's perfect if you like great beer, wine, food and service but not a big, trendy crowd.  This is my five star \" we love this bar's service, beer, food and incognito location\" review! Add bookmark ;)"}
{"text":"Quaint, always on point. Great small plates and great glasses or bottles of wine. We frequent this place when meeting with friends for drinks or a night cap. Plus the bartenders are always the best and on point. Great outdoor/indoor area. Anyone we bring always falls in love with it."}
{"text":"Scapegoat is a great spot for a little wine down happy hour! The space is nice and quaint with a nice wine and beer selection. Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. I would definitely visit this bar when in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent!   We had the bread and cheese board and the g.o.a.t.  Soooooo good. A little loud but enjoyable. Lexa was phenomenal!! she was all alone and did an Amazing job. Such a pleasure.   Great wine and good food. Highly recommended for an evening when you're in the mood for a simple meal with great wine.  The peanut butter crunch desert was amazing. Please give this place a try."}
{"text":"Nice looking place in a trendy area in Scottsdale. Bar had a busy weekend so was out of half of the beers and some food."}
{"text":"This place is adorable. My bf and I came after dinner on Friday night around 9PM and it was the perfect amount of people. Very tiny inside but wasn't packed, and still some open spots at the bar. There was a tv at the bar so I was able to watch my cubbies (lose, boo). And the beer & wine selection was good. I think there was around 15 beers on tap? Maybe a few more. Oh and the bathroom was very clean, which was shocking for there only being one (no offense men).  The only mishap was that the credit card machine stopped working when we were ready to go. So we had to wait 10-15 minutes until someone came to fix it."}
{"text":"My new favorite chill spot in Scottsdale - great beer options (including Bells Two Hearted!!) and best bartenders around. I'm currently falling in love with the Thursday night atmosphere... !"}
{"text":"Went early on a Saturday evening.  Ordered an Italian wine and was not disappointed.  Thoroughly enjoyed the soppressata and olives. The atmosphere is perfect to spend time with good friends.  It is a small establishment but if you go early, it is a cozy spot."}
{"text":"I love this place! It may be small but it is mighty. It's a great starting/ending point to a night in Old Town. The beer selection/variation is awesome. They also have a wine menu but I didn't get a good look at it. The food is freaking awesome.  It's mainly munchies but there is a Croque Monsieur that is out of this world good. I'm excited to go back and try the other things on the menu that I haven't tried. The owner was also very nice!"}
{"text":"Yes please. This place is the real deal. Good selection of beer and wine and the food was on point. The bar tender (Alexa) knew her stuff and was so much fun to talk to. The cherry on top was the food was delicious. I would recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Probably my new favorite place in Old Town! Super chill place to grab a wine or beer with friends. Plus 1) It's not dark so I could read the menu and 2) The music is catchy and at a perfect volume. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Our bartender knew is wine list inside and out and the food smelled delicious. Next time we will plan to have dinner."}
{"text":"This is a great new spot! We came here for apps/small plates before going out to dinner and it did not disappoint!  First off, its a small space but its decorated very simply and comfortably. The bar takes up most of the room however it fits a ton of people. We sat by the big front window since the night was awesome. There are chairs at the window and also a big table - so we grabbed that.  The owners are the bartenders and servers - its really freakin' cool that they are out there working their butts off in their place. I really appreciate that and they were SO nice.   Their menu is simple but delicious both for drinks and food. We had the pretzel and pate - great pate! Seriously, I am not usually into that and this was delicious! FYI - its garlicy so if on a date, make sure they eat it too! We had the cheese/butchers board - it comes out on a slate plate and its a pretty decent assortment and actually the perfect size for 4 people to share - we didn't have anything left on the plate however none of us were disappointed by the size of it. We also had a snack that is equivalent to crack - I forget what they were called, but they were buttery cheese delicious little balls of bread that we all agreed we could have eaten an entire order to ourselves. Order them for sure.  All in all this was a great experience and we are excited to go back to see what more they do (if at all) with the menu and the space as they get going more. Really pleased and happy that this sweet couple opened this up!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this cozy wine bar in Old Town.  Modern meets speakeasy kind of vibe with a beautiful interior and excellent drink selections.  The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the locations can't be beat. Definitely a new favorite in the neighborhood. :) Five stars for Scapegoat!"}
{"text":"Amazing find in this little gem. Staff is EXTREMELY wonderful! Out of this world food experience for any foodie. Hands down wonderful!"}
{"text":"What nice small joint! Roger was awesome. Great local beer and wine list with a very chill vibe. A great place to have some quiet time with your favorite person."}
{"text":"Great little beer and wine bar in old town Scottsdale where the atmosphere is chill and the service is great. They also have really good food offerings. So glad it opened!"}
{"text":"Nice little corner wine bar.  Small cozy.  Excellent choices made in their beer selection.  Didn't try the wine.  Corner has box of games to play.  Great neighborhood feel.   I haven't been here enough to give my full 5 stars.  But at same time I can see it becoming a 5 star kinda hangout. So I certainly can't end their 5 star run with my excellent experience."}
{"text":"Attentive staff, good live music, & some great grapes. What more do you need?  Oh, show up Tuesdays for 1/2 priced bottles of vino ;-)"}
{"text":"This is small chill spot. Not at all like the old town Scottsdale scene. Great laid back place to drink. Great happy hour prices. Good selection of beer on tap. Good eats. Cool bartender."}
{"text":"One of our favorite local hang outs. Great wine and beer selection.  Happy hour daily and on Saturday.   Dont miss live music and half price wine on Tuesday!  Owner Mike is the best too.  Support this local establishment!"}
{"text":"Mike is amazing. Come here for a good time & attentive service. You won't be disappointed. And if you are, that's your problem bra ;)"}
{"text":"Best date place in Scottsdale.  It's a very small and intimate little bar that also serves food (never eaten anything but I've heard great things).  Mike is usually behind the bar and he's just an all around fantastic human being."}
{"text":"Cool, intimate place to hang with a few friends. Good craft beer and wine selection. Good option if you want to be in downtown Scottsdale but don't want to deal with \"bros\"!"}
{"text":"Walking around Old Town looking for a place to sit and grab a drink. This place was very nice. Small, quiet and not crowded. They had a small but good selection of snacks to compliment the beer and wine. I would have liked more selection in the wine list, but this was a good find. The bartender was very personable and had some great recommendations on beer and wine. They have live music on Tuesdays too!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with a small group and loved it. Tuesdays from 6-9pm they have live music and 1/2 off bottles of wine. It's a great deal!"}
{"text":"Great place, great atmosphere, from the food to the beer. It might be small but has lots to offer laid back everyone was really friendly. Price reasonable, mix crowed."}
{"text":"Lucked out and got two of the few seats open around 8 on a Thursday. This place is small, busy, and loud but in the best way if you like that sort of thing! Good draft selection and good service from the girl behind the bar that seemed to be taking care of the whole place. We never felt ignored or rushed and I liked that. We also tried the meat and cheese board, and the olives...both yummy! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cool little quaint place. Great way to start the evening. The avocado bread was awesome. Will be back. Small place so can fill up with only a doze or so folks."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day.  Great list of wines and the cheese board was really good.  Small place, but a nice vibe and the music is on point. Will certainly return soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in with two friends on a Saturday. We were visiting from out of town and in Scottsdale for a meeting starting the next morning so wanted to have a relaxing night before it started. This was the perfect place to do so.  We got seats at the bar and it wasn't too loud. We split two bottles of wine which were super reasonably priced and also ordered a cheese plate. The ambiance here was awesome, i would definitely go back and would recommend it to a friend. Next time i am in Scottsdale I would definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Cool concept and nice decor!  I came here for a drink before an event and thoroughly enjoyed their chill vibe. I went around 5:00pm on a Thursday and was the only person in the place for a little while. The gal that greeted me was instantly so friendly and even struck up some conversation as I waited for my friend, which was nice!   I only had one drink, the Cirino cider, and it was good! Definitely didn't leave you with cotton mouth like Angry Orchard does, or the like. My friend had an Orange Blossom beer and she loved it! Plus they had a Yelp offer (or what I'm assuming is their happy hour at the time) of $2 off beers and $3 off wines. Throw a little jenga into the mix and we were chillin! Perf!  The place is 'very' small. Some people may not like that because I imagine being able to find seats on a busy night would be hit or miss, but that's what makes it different! Not every place needs to be huge enough to accommodate the entire city, that type of vibe can ruin the exclusivity of it.   I can't say much else about the food/drinks because I only had one, but everything including the service was great. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  The bartender was very friendly, she explained the Tuesday night 1/2 price wine bottle deal.  Needless to say, we took advantage of that.  There was a performer there that night, Michael Land....man, what a great voice!  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Smaller, quieter beer and wine pub.  Appetizers were unique.  I am more of a wine snob and I thought the beer selections were way better then the wine selections.  This is a great place for a first date or want to get away from the I can't hear anything because it is to loud in here crowd."}
{"text":"Visiting from Denver and was in town for work on a Tuesday night. Was pleasantly surprised to find a welcoming vibe, amazingly friendly GM, delicious food and great atmosphere. The Farm Salad was fresh, filling and featured a yummy pesto dressing. The beers on tap were from AZ, MI, CO, CA and PA and all had a unique story behind the brewery and were crisp and refreshing to taste. Every Tuesday night features live music and the singer songwriter I heard was awesome! Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Very cool ambiance but service at the bar was slow.  They had a great drink menu but mostly app type food choices.  Great singer was performing but the space was way too small for the sound and it made conversation nearly impossible so we ended up eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice place, but way smaller than I expected. It might seat thirty people. Craft beer and wine, fancy foods. Would be great for a date, not so much for meeting up with a friend."}
{"text":"Scapegoat is one of my favorite places in old town. It may be small in size but it's staff and wine/beer selection make it huge. The wine selection is reasonably priced and always on point. Huge recommendation!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit scapegoat considering all of the 5 star reviews but I just can't give 5 stars. My friend and I came in for happy hour on Friday at 5:30 and had extremely slow service. The one bartender was the only bartender and sever in the entire place and we had to go to the bar 3 times to get him to come over to our table to take our order. Food and wine was delicious, but customer service needs improvement (maybe having more than 1 employee working)."}
{"text":"Great spot with unique appetizers - the cheese puffs are light and delicious and just kinda inspiring.  Solid wines by the glass. Cool dark little place with a speakeasy vibe."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting on a girls trip. This place delivered on all counts. Great vibe, delicious wine, perfect small plates of food and friendly people. Loved that the owner helped us find a seat because it's small place and you may walk past and think there's no room. Definitely worth the stop in!!"}
{"text":"Great new spot tucked away in Old Town! Love the beer and wine list, music selection, and small plates.  Refreshing spot that is different than typical scene. Me and wife will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Scapegoat was a great place to kick off our night. It is fairly small so I can imagine it getting crowded, but for late on a Saturday night it ended up being perfect. The bartender was extremely attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was ideal for drinks and conversation - not too loud at all. There was a good selection of beer and wine with some food items as well. The drinks were slightly more expensive than some of the other locations nearby, but overall I would highly recommend Scapegoat."}
{"text":"YES! I have wanted to hit up Scapegoat for maybe a full year now, and I have finally done it!  After a wine tasting nearby, a friend and I giddily made our way over. Now, when someone describes this place as \"cozy\", please note that they mean REALLY cozy. As in super intimate, probably smaller than my 500-ish square foot studio. But I guess none of that matters as long as they don't get overwhelmingly busy. The decor and layout of the space has clearly been put together to maximize the small square footage. I really loved the look/feel.  Since our wine tasting had been predominantly whites and rose, we decided to stick with something light, and settled on a bottle of the Pinot Project Rose. We had definitely missed happy hour by this time, and I honestly could not tell you what kind of deal or promotion it was for, but the bottle was half off. Yay! The wine was a little sweeter than we were anticipating, but it was still good and that's honestly all that matters.  We sat near the front of the place, and there were little Jenga's on the table. At some point of the evening, Cards Against Humanity was also pulled out out of nowhere. There was some live music in the corner, and in my opinion, it was a little too much for the small space. But it still added some great ambiance.  I wasn't expecting to really eat much here since it's a wine/beer bar, but they had some delicious looking food offerings. We decided on the meat and cheese board. It was all very delicate. The portion wasn't the largest, but everything was scrumptious. Server rocked, too!  Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"What can you say about the perfect bar? Much smaller than most of the monstrosities in this town. But that's the point. You come here to get great beer, great snacks, and great service.  Oh and great music and games."}
{"text":"Great spot to bring friends if you're looking for something fun and laid back. Awesome happy hour and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Music is on point and loving the ambience!! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Such a gem in the middle of old town Scottsdale. Interior is beautiful and staff is very inviting.   Great place to grab a drink with friends and a yummy snack.   We will return again and again."}
{"text":"Broad (and good) beer selection in draft great wine list and friendly bartenders. We didn't get any food but the menu, though limited, sounded interesting and the next tim I'm in, I'll be sure to order something.   Their happy hour prices were very good for the area the are in. This is the kind of place you go to have a couple drinks before dinner/your night out. Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"This place was really cool. Great cheese plate beer and the live music was really good. The only thing I didn't care for was the pretty tall brunette bartender and her shitty attitude. We spent good $ and we're very nice. Maybe she wasn't having a good night but her pissy-ness I could've delt without."}
{"text":"Great little spot w/super service! Nice vibe, tucked away, dark and comfy. We didn't order any food but the menu looked great!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back to this super chill & intimate bar next time I am in the neighborhood. Great wine and great service!"}
{"text":"First time at Scapegoat and loved everything about the place except the music was a little too loud tonight.  Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Just as all the others say about this place! Totally awesome.  Service, food and beer! Glad I left that other bar!"}
