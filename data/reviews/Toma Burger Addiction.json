{"text":"I ordered through orderit.ca.  I ordered the standard cheeseburger but with a gluten free bun.  These burgers are delicious!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to the interior of this place since we ordered delivery through just-eat.ca. Delivery was prompt, considering it was a Saturday night.  Better yet, the burgers were amazing!  The bun to burger ratio was spot on and the buns themselves had excellent flavour that complimented what was going on in the burger itself.  It's been over a week and all I can think about is finding an excuse to get another burger.  I can personally recommend the Cheesy, but our group also got the El Diablo, The Wild Life and the Monster. Everyone was still talking about our meal the next day.  I've eaten a lot of great burgers in Toronto, but this place easily moves into my top three favourite places (not just of burger places but all places)."}
{"text":"First, the burger tastes just so so, dry and over cooked, the beef tastes more like a seasoned sausage, not fresh and juicy at all. cannot compete with burger priest, behind five guys...... however, bread, milkshake are good. the price is ridiculous!!! 2 burger + 2 fries + 1 milkshake = $50  price does not equal the quality!!!!! and default 18% tip is bullshit. Their Fries probably are the worst i never had in my life, strongly suspecting they were using previous-cooked fries to serve us or overcooked oil. Both of us have digestion issues next day!!!!!!!!!!!  pretty sure they will shut down soon at the neighbourhood!  so if u don't believe me, plz go to try it by yourself asap before they shut down!  Peace!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. I should've known better and not ordered a salad at a burger joint. Someone else ordered a burger and said it was decent."}
{"text":"I've been twice and the food has been consistently excellent. The sweet potato fries, the burgers (and no fuss if you order it without a bun!). The chocolate-peanut butter milkshake (whoohoo!). Wine list is meh, but that is not why you go here.   This is a \"hidden gem\" - it should be packed for the quality of food and great service it offers.  \"I'll be back!\" :D  p.s. They do take-out and you can order online!"}
{"text":"On a fateful Sunday afternoon, after an unsuccessful attempt to obtain jamaican patties (I had forgotten that the best places are closed Sunday), we decided that the best alternative would be to sink our teeth in a juicy, delicious burger. Heading back towards downtown, we googled the best burger in Toronto and saw amazing reviews for Toma, along with awards and distinctions. Perfect!  The gods were on our side as we found parking right across the street and headed inside to the joys of gustation. The menu was exciting, and I found myself drawn by several selections but finally settled on an enticing combination of pulled pork and beef patty. After one mischievous glance towards my dining partner, we also both agreed on ordering classic poutines to accompany this fine feast. Being both from Quebec, we had our doubts but figured that someone, by now, would be able to perfect this unhealthy yet satisfying culinary delight in Toronto at last. The online reviews all raved about it, after all.  The slow service did not dissuade us from enjoying our time at Toma, as the ambiance (and the company) was nice. Large booths allowed us to spread out and salivate at the thought of these delicious aliments that would shortly be presented to us.  The food arrived. A finely crafted burger branded with a large \"T\" on the top of the bun was set next to a beautiful bowl of french fries smothered in sauce and... wait, what's wrong with the curds?  The classic poutine was neither classic nor poutine. While the french fries could, I'm sure, be quite nice on their own, their size meant they were completely overwhelmed by the sauce. The curds were... strange at best. I still can't figure out if they were actually cheese. They looked like pieces of processed mozzarella (the kind you get in No Name bricks) passed through a spaetzle maker and had no characteristic taste or flavour. Its texture introduced me for the first time to the feeling of having semen in my mouth from multiple glory holes, an experience I would rather not repeat. The sauce had an off taste, not just from being over salted (which we all come to expect in restaurant fare), but as if a squirrel or other small land mammal had taken to swimming in the vat and left behind a special mix of seasonings.  The burger was equally strange. The bun was, at best, fine, but the beef patty had no distinctive taste that would make one go \"wow\". In fact, the texture was a bit off, as if the ground meat had been overworked. The cheese also had a particularly strange taste. If such cheese had been served on Alderaan, the tremor in the force would have been one of relief. My dining partner, who had ordered a much more classic combination, had a similar reaction.  Starvation does not equal causation. We reluctantly finished the burger as we had had nothing else to eat that day, but left the seed-laden french fries aside and walked back out amazed that such cookery would obtain such rave reviews and awards. We are not hipsters or againsters, and can in fact enjoy food from all levels, from dives to fine dining. I can even find redeeming qualities in some of the worst fast food out there. Something was way off here.  But this is not where the story ends.  The combination of ingredients ingested minutes earlier began to combine in fast digestion as my body decided that Toma was best left out of my system. Minutes later, just as the so-called brioche bun was branded with a large \"T\", so would my anus be branded by the intense burn of hellfire as one ingredient after another used my insides as a boiling cauldron of witch brew that would punish me for not only the next hours, but the next day as well. Less than an hour after the last mastication, I had to sit at the porcelain throne to spew out a stream of acid that actually made me cry. As the stream of molten lava came pouring out of me, I converted from atheism to three different major religions and a few minor ones as well, as only some sort of divine punishment could explain the terror that was coming out of my bowels. Each rumbling of my stomach made me cry out for forgiveness, as my body was transformed into a geyser of burning, liquid excrement four more times that night. I collapsed in a cold sweat on the floor of the bathroom, crawling back to bed with hesitation as I pictured with horror the inevitable result of my body falling asleep and relaxing its sphincters.  While I was lucky enough to make it through the night without chemical burns on my thighs, the next day was dreadful as I had to take the road towards Ottawa by car, with my stomach still churning and warning me that this plague was not over with. I thank the designers of the OnRoute system and apologize for the strange chemical offshoot that they will have noticed in their water filtration. My new god Ogoun Badagris will receive offerings on their behalf.  Definitely an unforgettable experience."}
{"text":"I thought Toma Burgers was just like the other burger joints in the DT area but what seperates this place is thier FRESHLY made BUNS and freshly burger toppings which i dont even know how to pronounce lol, overall it seems a bit pricy but a time to splerge is a time to eat good and was well worth it. Definitely one of the TOP 5 burgers in toronto to check out. The buns are what make it such a great choice. And this is coming from a guy thats worked in the kitchen for over 10years."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend had a dinner yesterday. The menu is really tempting. Most burgers start at $8.99 and the size is very ok.  The one that we ate is really good. The meat was juicy and very tasty.  We also had fries with truffle oil and parsley, definitely this is a must try from the place."}
{"text":"I had come into this place still hungry after a business meeting at a very unaccommodating neighbouring Italian restaurant where there was very little focus on customer experience and dietary adjustments.  This place was amazing in comparison.  If you are looking for a clean,comfortable welcoming atmosphere to enjoy a great burger and fries this is the place.  The server Victoria was friendly, gracious and articulate and they had gluten free options and attention to dietary preferences. I will happily return and recommend it to anyone looking for a casual to dine alone or with a few friends. Very relaxing."}
{"text":"A good tasting and generously portioned burger. Decor was better than most burger joints. Service was adequate.  Tip: forgo the pathetic fries"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout here from Just-Eat and was pleasantly surprised! The Wild Life burger was amazing, as were the truffle fries. The only drawback is the price - quite expensive for burgers."}
{"text":"Really great service! After a mix-up with an order earlier this week, Sean I believe his name was, really came through w exceptional customer service! I've already loved their burgers and now I can say that I love their customer service as well! Thanks Sean!"}
{"text":"We came to eat here the other week. The place itself was pretty nice and comfortable. The food however was meh. We tried El Diablo and The Wild life. Overall, the burgers were just way to dense for our liking. The Milk bun, albeit soft was surprisingly dense. The patty was also dense and over-cooked. Perhaps if they toasted the bun a bit and cooked the burgers to medium rare instead of well done, then we might try it again. But as is, probably wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"I had a La Boheme burger for lunch and it was really good.  The house made bun was fresh and the burger patty was very tasty and cooked perfectly. The onion and bacon marmalade is what made this burger.  Totally worth the expensive price tag."}
{"text":"A-mazing  The Cheesy- literally THE best burger I've ever had in my life. It's the bun that makes the burger complete. :) and the truffle fries....so yummy!!!  Gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"I've been once before and It wasn't bad but this time it was not the greatest. My meat was under cooked and burger was soggy. Definitely will never be back"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places in Toronto - and they deliver! Just the basic cheeseburger for me, but there is something about the bun that makes it so much more. Fries are ok, go for the onion rings!"}
{"text":"I love burgers and I know what burgers taste bad and what taste good. This place is GOOD. Try the truffle fries!! The smell of the truffle will mouthwater you!!! The TOMA Poutine is delicious, THE MILKSHAKE IS so legit too! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food: The Double Jackpot: I wouldn't know there was any foie gras since it was thin and tiny and had almost no taste to it. The burger also was a bit on the sweet side.   Service: Friendly but sooo slow. It took 30 minutes for the burger to finally arrive."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Toma (I have previously tried to order from them, but called past 9:30PM and was not able to get my order in on time).  Tonight, I ordered delivery at 8:45PM.  Called back at 10:15PM as I had not yet received the order. They told me they were just waiting for the driver to leave the restaurant... one and a half hours AFTER I placed the order!  I called back at 11:00PM as there was still no order.    Around 11:30, the order finally arrived.  The burgers were just slightly warm and a bit soggy.  Not the best, but to be fair, not the worst considering it was almost 3 hours of waiting.  However, the truffle fries were inedible (a waste).  Not only were they cold, but they were burnt and just unappetizing.    Additionally, I was overcharged (I ordered the combo and was charged separately for items).  Not a big deal, but also doesn't leave me with a good overall impression of the place.  I understand that perhaps it was a busy night, but it's not very considerate to tell your customers that the delivery should arrive under an hour, only to have them wait almost 3 hours for sub-par and inedible food (especially if you know it's a busy night).    Overall, definitely not worth the price ($38 after tax and delivery), and an unpleasant experience overall.  Maybe the dine-in experience is better (I sincerely hope so).  The only reason I gave the restaurant two stars was because the delivery guy was friendly and they did call back to give us a credit.  I do appreciate this gesture, but if it weren't for this credit, I wouldn't order from this restaurant ever again.   I'm hoping next time will be a better experience, as I really had high expectations for \"Toronto's Best Burger.\""}
{"text":"As a person who rarely eats meat, I get really stoked out on a good burger. Went here (given it was near close) and the food wasn't great! Tasty... but it was basically corn fed beef dressed up nicely (im feeling bloated now..I wish I just went to holy chuck) ...small menu,  Overpriced too!  Decent service... The sangria was good too..  Walking distance from my house, but if this place wants to be a boutique burger it's going to have to go with real grass fed."}
{"text":"This is my new fave burger spot. I went here on Friday night with my bf, we love how the atmosphere is so chill and family friendly.  Also, the decor of the place is pretty cool and trendy.  We love the fact is that we can actually sit down like in a restaurant to enjoy our dinner unlike Burger Priest, it's cramp.  I ordered the \"The Double Jackpot\": Beef Patty, mushroom, caramelized onion, double bacon, truffle mayo, arugula, truffle oil, balsamic glaze and the best part is the \"foie gras\".. Omg! It just melts in your mouth and flavour just comes together very well. My bf ordered the \"The Wild Life\": Beef patty, swiss cheese, cremini mushrooms, truffle mayo, arugula, double smoked bacon, balsamic glaze, truffle oil.. he love his too. For sure I'll be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, perfectly respectable poutine and well designed interiors.  Have tried The Cheesy burger and the Classic previously and they were both really good.  Portions are healthy and priced reasonably for something of this quality."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had in my life!!! Sunday night and all we wanted was a good burger. Our go to place (burger priest) is closed on Sundays so we decided to try something new.   The burgers are very unique not something you see every day. Gourmet burgers! Love the variety of burgers. It's a place with more than just burgers, bacon, and cheese.   We opted to have delivery done and that's the only part that keeps this review from having 5 starts. The driver was 10 minutes late on top of an already 45 min wait (we only live 5 min away).   Would certainly eat here again and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"First time here I ordered the classic and it was delicious. The patty was seasoned well and juicy. Could really tell the quality of beef used. Atmosphere was the nicest I've seen for a burger joint...could pass for a tapas bar. Would def recommend for a good quality burger."}
{"text":"They will go to great lengths to make sure customers are satisfied. The burgers are delicious, the service is impeccable."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Toma. Stopped in for a quick bite last night. Overall, good experience.   Service: Fast, friendly/welcoming.  Food: I ate the Old School burger and a side of the classic mac n cheese. The burger, although delicious, was very hot. I burnt my tongue. The mac n cheese, on the other hand, wasn't as hot as I expected. The buns Toma bakes in-house are fantastic! Bun to patty ratio was great, but I felt like I wanted more toppings on the burger. You can order additional toppings, but it didn't sound like it was something Toma usually does. Burgers come as is.   Atmosphere: Clean, inviting. Comfortable booth seating. Had much more of a 'sit and stay' vibe than you usually get at a burger joint. Although nice, I felt like this was a miss considering the overall simplicity of the branding, and the menu.    Price: Great value for what you get.   Ps. They deliver! And have an Instagram account too. I appreciate a restaurant that embraces its customers outside of its normal channel of interaction and isn't afraid to show off its food."}
{"text":"Very good burgers!!  I loved the art on the walls! Great atmosphere  I had the 25$ burger made from Kobe beef. It was pretty good! Made me want to order another one.  Definitely recommend it. However don't go if you're looking for large portions!"}
{"text":"Loved the burger! The bun was delicious and pretty (had a T on it). I got the cheeseburger and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Has the wagu burger with black truffle. It was great. Bun was too much, too big for the meat. I took off have of it. Truffle fries were good but not over the top. My son had the wild side burger. He was impressed enough to want to go back. He's a bit of a foodie m, so that's a good sign."}
{"text":"Good premium angus burgers, with great sides like truffle Poutine with bacon.   For burger week, I came in for the Wild Life burger with truffle mayo, arugula, cremini mushrooms and Swiss.   Also ordered the truffle Poutine on the side. Burger was well presented with a branded T bun, and looked the part of premium burger. Angus patty was delicious as expected. Truffle Poutine's cheese felt disappointing, though the truffle oil definitely adds an air of luxury to the Poutine.  Hostess was fighting back hoards of diners who wanted the free Paypal burger, so the place felt a but crazy at times."}
{"text":"Well let me first start off with telling you that the burgers are very satisfactory, they have some amazing vegetarian options that taste divine, which is why i gravitate to Toma. With that being said, if you are a ketchup lover and like having ketchup with your food, they might refuse to give you more than 2 packets, i have been a loyal customer pf Toma, and ordered almost every day, my bill at the end of the week would be 100$, i like having ketchup with my burger and i don't expect the restaurant to refuse to give me more than 2 packets, which is exactly what happened, i canceled my order worth 38$ because they refused to give me more ketchup. I know it sounds silly but if a customer wants more ketchup, you give them more ketchup, not tell me I'm limited to 2 packets per burger. This is the stupidest business practice i've ever experienced, they lost a loyal paying customer over a few packets of ketchup , so, although the burgers are divine, the customer service is lacking. I wont be ordering again, i don't appreciate being refused condiments with the food i'm paying for! Enjoy your packets of ketchup TOMA, i hope they pay your bills LOL"}
{"text":"Unreal burger place in Queen West. Gourmet and exotic toppings galore. Milkshakes here are amazing. Definitely swing by for one of the most epic burgers in TO."}
{"text":"Simply the best burgers in Toronto. Great quality and taste. Made with love. Decor could be a little cozier and they need a real milkshake on the menu."}
{"text":"The truffle fries are an experience, dont use ketchup! The burger has multiple layers of taste, and you'll be wondering how so much goodness was in one bite!  On top of that, Gerard is probably one of the kindest people in the business"}
{"text":"Toma burgers is the latest restaurant at 712 Queen Street West. It was voted in some magazine as being in the top 10 burgers of toronto.  Had to try it. The burgers are good but here are my beefs.   The server, very pleasant, informed us of how the beef is prepared fresh, and the buns used are house made.    When I got my burger I realized why.   They have to house make the buns because No bakery makes buns small enough to hold  the small patty used by Toma. Mind you the sweet bun and burger was juicy and tasty.  Ordered a side of onion rings. The onion rings were pre fab. It passed as gourmet because of the sprinkle of Parmesan and parsley on it.  Couldn't shake the fact that it cost $9.00 and that it came frozen out of the bag.  Do us justice and charge $5.00.   No parking and no value to the menu however the morsel of burger I had I have to admit was good."}
{"text":"Another burger place along Queen Street West to try out. When I arrived around 1:10pm, the place was completely empty. They had sit down area or you can order takeout (which is cheaper).  I tried the Old School burger ($12) and added small side of Onion Rings ($6). After my bill came out to $23 after tip, which is pretty expensive to me for just a burger and a side. I did not think it was worth that money. The burger was just alright. It came on a brioche bun but that did not really make a big difference in terms of texture and taste. The only big difference is that there is a \"T\" mark on the bun which is more of an aesthetic look to the burger. The patty was just average but the bbq sauce was good. Other burger places in Toronto offer better tasting burgers than here.  I find that the onion rings were better than the burger since they added Parmesan cheese and chives on it. Tasted better than the burger itself.  Would I come back? Probably not or just for takeout since it is cheaper. The only huge drawback is that there is table service (they should just take orders and let people sit) and the price of the burgers which was not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Sorry but any place that only has lagers on tap or in bottles are beer ignoramuses and I won't go. Mill st tank house is their only ale and I would never drink that by choice. Come on people  getting in some craft brew is not hard it is 2017! No IPA is a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Ordered the Maya Salad and totally hit the spot. My husband ordered a burger and it was huge! Great place!"}
{"text":"I was ambling down Queen St and the poster picture in the window sucked me in. A great looking burger. The server was friendly and made recommendations. I had La Boheme. But before I go there, the server mentioned the bartender made a great Long Iced Tea (and normally would never order), was in fact, it was an excellent concoction of flavours.   Now for the burger. The Selling point for me was blue cheese and onion/bacon marmalade. It arrived hot and looked inviting. First bite. Got mostly the brioche bun which was dense, dry and felt like it was yesterday's left over. I wasn't expecting a classic french brioche, but that made the eating the rest of the burger an underwhelming experience. That photo was worth a thousand words but I can't say the same for La Boheme.  The patty was lacking in flavour and umami. A hit and miss if other reviews are considered. With that, I went in search of the blue cheese and marmalade. Only hints of both and clearly wasn't going to live up to the billing as headliners.  I also had the house fries. I ordered a small and it was more than I could finish off for two reasons. If I was going to finish, what turned out to be a mediocre burger, the pile of fries I could have shared with my wife - if she was with me. But that pile, while hot was jammed into a bowl where the starch became gummy and came off undercooked. The best fries, that are crispy with a delicate soft interior, needs to be doubled cooked (fried twice, first at a lower temp, cooled and then they're ready for prime time when ordered). It takes more time but I'd prefer perfectly cooked fries in a smaller batch than a bowl of gumminess.  I recently moved to \"The Six\", so would I come back? Unlikely after this first impression. There are a lot of burger joints here, so I'm going to check out more and settle on the best I can get."}
{"text":"No doubt one of the best burgers around. We really enjoy all their offerings and the space."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Truffle Fries are amazing - burgers never have disappointed (both dine in and take out). Buns are soft and meat is flavourful. I can't think of a better burger joint in Toronto in terms of food quality."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in here at about 4 PM. There were only a few other people here. We ordered quick, and then slowly went downhill.  A gentleman came in to pick up a take-out order, and then got into a discussion with the server and manager about a promotion that the restaurant wasn't honouring in regards to using an online app. (didn't hear the full story because it's not my business). Seemed like it wasn't over a lot of money, but the promotion wasn't clearly explained or qualified. Toma wasn't giving in and the customer left with a bad experience. I bet they'll never come back now...  A few minutes later a group of four people came in, And for whatever reason the restaurant wouldn't modify an order for one of the customers so all four of them left. Bet they won't be back either.  Then the server came to our table 10 minutes after we ordered and didn't know whether we had ordered yet or were ready to order (?). Considering we were the only people in there at the time, not exactly sure what that was about. When the order finally arrived, they had mixed up our two orders but it was a minor mistake.   Food itself was fine, but there seems to be a major lack of customer service and communication here. Maybe they were just having a bad day, but there are better choices on Queen St W"}
{"text":"Burger Week continues!    The burgers here were pretty good (very juicy) but I'm not sure if they're worth the $12.99 regular price tag.    The way the tables are cleared and people are seated has to be the most inefficient process I've ever witnessed.  I'm sure they weren't expecting lines down the sidewalk for the Burger Week PayPal promo.  I had a root beer float and it was very good.  I also tried the poutine which was okay, but the cheese curds weren't what I was expecting.  Fresh, yes, but not \"squeaky\"."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a burger so we chose here. We each ordered a burger but the wait for food was long. The restaurant was not busy but it looked like there was a lot of take out. The burgers were okay. They were very done and didn't have a ton of flavor considering the combinations they have. We will choose a different place to try next time."}
{"text":"This was a really good experience, the food was really well prepared and presented. It looks like they have pride in what they are producing and it shows.   The burgers were made of high quality meat and perfectly cooked for thick burgers, very juicy... my only complaint was that my patty seemed to be missing some flavour, i couldn't taste any salt whatsoever, it's possible that it was just one of those patty's that missed some of the seasoning, but I'll definitely give it another try just to make sure. If it's the same then we know they don't season their burgers very well, which seems odd considering that they go so far with the excellent high quality toppings and their exquisitely delicious home made brioche bun.   I also had the Toma award winning poutine too, the gravy was delicious, the fries fresh and perfectly cooked, i found the caramelized onions were tasty, but too sweet for poutine in my opinion at least, the double smoked bacon was a great touch but i couldn't taste or smell any truffle oil as they promised. Next time I'll just have the regular poutine because those curds were super fresh and damn squeaky!!   I just hope my burger is better seasoned on my second visit."}
{"text":"I did not know what to expect with TOMA.  Their branding is not exactly Queen West (read: they don't have the \"rustic\" hipster-y decor and its not filled with bearded guys wearing plaid).  I decided to give it a try.  It was hands down the best burger I have had in this city.  I had the Diablo.  Every element of that burger is perfect.  The burger patty is large and juicy and most importantly it tastes very good and is cooked perfectly.  The bun is incredible and doesn't get smooshed up in the largesse of the patty - it holds its own.  The bacon is also perfectly cooked.   I don't think this place is competing in the Toronto burger wars for a few reasons: 1. the ingredients are top notch.  I believe the bun is homemade brioche and the patty is prime rib. It honestly tastes way better than your standard burger. 2. You can drink here.  That's right - unlike other burger places Toma has wine and beer. 3. The decor is somewhat upscale, which I will grant you is kind of weird for a burger joint.  But I think the idea behind TOMA is less \"fast food\" and more \"sit down and eat something well made for once in your sad life\".  It works.  I was very impressed. If you want to enjoy a seriously solid burger I would highly recommend TOMA."}
{"text":"We were craving burgers and Toma served up some delicious creations. I ordered the Vegas which was pretty spectacular in its own right, although I hear that the regular Angus burger served here can give the Kobe Wagyu patty (in the Vegas) a run for its money. I will definitely come back and try their other menu items. I got my fries with truffle oil and they tasted great; I tried this purely out of curiosity and didn't regret it. The three scoop ice cream milkshake was delicious as well. You can taste the quality of the ingredients that goes into their food. Bonus points for serving a burger that looks as amazing as it tastes."}
{"text":"I went to this place after an evening at the CNE with friends.  It's a Wednesday and we arrived close to 10pm so definitely no rush or crowds.  Our server was a little slow but she was the only one serving and managing the cash register. It was fairly empty and i believe there was 1-2 other tables. I ordered the El Rio Grande burger mainly because it had guacamole and I love anything with that. I also shared a plate of house fries with my friends. When we got our burgers, we were amused by the \"T\" imprinted on the top bun.The one thing that surprised me was how tasty the bun was. It had a sweetness to it that made the burger unique in taste. Overall, the burger was good but I didn't really care for the fries. The fries were small and not crispy.   I would probably go back to try another burger, but avoid the fries."}
{"text":"A reviewer had it right. This burger was supremely underwhelming and the fries were downright disappointing. I got a classic + jalapeños with a side of small fries.  Pros: - the burger is nice and filling - lots of options and specialty burgers - homemade brioche buns which are pretty nice  Cons: - the cost of the sides are heavily inflated and unless you make a meal out of one of the poutines a or salads you should probably skip a side.  - the fries are just as stubby as everyone says though they have gotten thicker - as a bread lover that brioche bun was a real hook, it turned out being subpar and much too dense.   Tl:dr I'm addicted to burgers, just not Toma's. I'd give this place a skip unless your in the mood for their specialty burgers."}
{"text":"Hey all,    Went today for a late lunch.  I give this place high marks.  I ordered the classic with fries.  The burger was juicy and the bun was sweet.  The fries were good.  Required some salt.  Otherwise with some wine ordered a great experience."}
{"text":"Best. Burgers. Ever. Whether you're looking for a classic burger or a gourmet burger, you need to check this place out. I seriously dream about these mouthwatering burgers at least once a week - and I'm not even a huge Burger lover to begin with!!!  My favs include El Diablo, La Boheme and The Wild Life. Burgers are served on a freshly made Brioche bun and all sauces are made in-house. The restaurant itself isn't anything special, but don't let the décor deter you from eating in. Or taking out!  The food will not disappoint. And the Servers are ridiculously friendly. Spread the word!"}
{"text":"We are on the hunt for the BEST BURGER in Toronto! Stop #3: Toma Burger Addiction  Let me start by asking for a moment of silence to respect the experience that I was just gifted with... amen. Look... Toma is boss, Toma is King, Toma is the Truth.  The restaurant itself looks more like a standard, proper restaurant than a burger joint. Nice booths, modern decor, blah blah blah, it looks great, on to these damn burgers!  I asked the waiter for the best burger that they had, to which he answered, with confidence, The Fabulous Las Vegas. Now when you order this bad boy reserve your judgement and don't you dare judge this book by its cover. You'll be served what appears to be a modest burger, with a politely round bun, a patty, some cheese melting down the side, and of course the iconic Toma \"T\" branding. But my friend, once you take a bite, this burger earns its price. The first thing you notice is this confusingly amazing bun. With the use of some sort of gypsy magic they've made it so that this light and slightly sweet bun holds up its shape and constitution not just while you're holding it, but even after you've taken a bite. (Respect that bun game.) Then you get hit with that Kobe Wagyu beef patty. I've never had Kobe beef before, so I have no other reference point, but let me advise you to believe the hype. It melts in your mouth and the texture is heavenly. The standard burger also features: truffle mayo, brie cheese, caramelized onions, sprouts, truffle oil, fleur de sel, and ground pepper, but sadly they messed up my order a smidge and gave me the toppings for their The Cheesy burger, which includes: truffle mayo, double cheddar, double swiss cheese, caramelized onions. Whatever, it was delicious.  I also had the truffle fries, which where pretty great. Not the best that I've ever had, but still great.  Lastly, I've got to speak to the service. My 4 friends and I came in right around when they were closing, but they were gracious enough to stay open, serve us up these killer sandwiches, and have some real, welcoming conversation with us. They make the buns daily in-house, and they get most of the meat daily as well. God bless them.  The burger hunt isn't over yet, but for now Toma is at the top of the list. Believe the hype!"}
{"text":"Although prices were pretty high even for a gourmet burger place, I really enjoyed my food here.  I had the \"Wild Life\" and my husband had the \"Dream Come True\". The burger patties were very moist, well cooked and tasty. The truffle mayo was an interesting touch to my burger, I felt like I was eating a really fancy burger. My husband's burger was very meaty and tasty...if you love anything pork (pulled pork and bacon), then you'll love this burger! We also shared a \"Toma Poutine\", which covered the fries in truffle oil, cheese curds and bacon..and omg it was heaven! I regret not ordering the larger size instead if the small.   Ambiance was quite classy for a burger place. Nice booths, modern decor and dim lighting. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. No complaints at all.  I think the prices is still a bit too high for what you get. Yes it is a gourmet joint, but still it's not a 5 star restaurant. But other than the prices, this place gets a deserving 4 stars! I'd come back again"}
{"text":"I came back here not too long after burger week and yes, the burgers are still pretty great even if you don't smell them for an hour while you wait in line.  I will say this though, the Las Vegas Burger was quite tasty and all, but I wouldn't say the kobe beef was any meaningful upgrade from the angus patties.  Also, despite what I said about the fries in my original review...I still got an order to split with my date. It just felt weird not to have fries?  There was also a good deal on beer, so three pints ahoy.  I'm definitely a solid fan now, though I'd still like to see more creativity with the fries and the possibility of onion rings."}
{"text":"We were introduced to Toma by a friend who described it as the best burger in toronto! That's actually a lie, the best burger is a Jonah Burger that i make on my grill and you are going to have to get into my good graces to taste that delicious meat!   We have been to Toma about 6 times now and the burgers which are pricy are truly Amazing!!! im hooked on the The Kalamb (Lamb patty, hold the brie cheese, cumin roasted aioli, Kalamata olives, spinach, roasted red pepper, I like to add goat cheese, and guacamole.   I have also had the monstrous John Wayne. Its a Beef patty, and a lamb patty, and a chicken patty, yup you read that correctly, its a triple decker of heaven!   i hold the cheddar, caramelized onions, hold the double smoked bacon not big on swine, chorizo, prosciutto di Parma, soppressata, chipotle mayo. and add goat cheese!   I'm not huge on fries, we usually get it for the kid, we found it to be hit or miss, last order we got totally stale fries.   Overall this is one amazingly delicious burger joint!"}
{"text":"I'm thinking, another burger place, surely we have enough of these. It was delicious. The El Diablo was juicy, flavorful, did I mention delicious?"}
{"text":"The Classic burger was delicious, im sure all their burgers are, however poutine had way too much salt and did not taste right. Id go there again for burger and fries but not for their poutine."}
{"text":"I've heard many good things about Toma and I never looked at the menu until arriving so I didn't know what to expect.  They have so many options it's overwhelming.  I mean just for the drinks alone they have a full bar and a few beers on tap and milkshakes oh my.  The bottom line is the food at this place is not your Burger's Priest, Woody's or anything that a person like me would consider an everyday type of burger experience.  This place gives me the impression of being the \"anti-chain\" if there's such a thing.  While the menu consists of all different things you can ask for pretty much anything and everything and make it the way you want because it's all is listed as an extra should you so choose to add it onto a preselected burger or create your own from scratch.  Creating your own includes the type of meat choices like chicken, lamb, wagyu or double it or whatever you want.  I just wanted as much as possible a bacon cheese burger but with a bit of flash.  This place serves what I'd consider over the top options sort of what La Belle et la Boeuf serves in Montreal but scaled back in size if that makes any sense.  My wife had gone with the Kalamb which is listed as:  Lamb patty, brie cheese, cumin roasted aioli, Kalamata olives, spinach, roasted red pepper.  I had asked for \"La Boheme\" which was listed as: Beef patty, blue cheese, swiss cheese, homemade onion & bacon marmalade, spinach, tomatoes.  Because I sort of wanted 2 cheeses and I ended up adding bacon to it.  La Boheme, \"it's an opera\"!  La Boheme was the tickets Louis Winthorpe III had in his jacket pocket in the movie Trading Places when he was getting booked.    Sides are a la carte and we ended up getting the Mexican poutine which is basically poutine with onions, bacon and guacamole added in there as well.  The buns are made on the premises while some of the options for  toppings are some dare I say it (Jenny N would not approve), \"gourmet\" toppings.  Foie Gras?  I really can't eat that so I stay away.  Truffle oil?  Strong, can be pricey sure but do I really want that on a burger?  Wagyu beef patty?  I've had before at a place in Pittsburgh.  I didn't really think it was special.  In fact if I had Wagyu beef I don't think I'd want to ground it up and make it a burger.  It would sort of be like taking a ribeye and making that into a burger.  Personally I'd want the unadulterated version of that cut of meat.  Prosciutto di Parma is expensive stuff and I love eating it on its own.  To mix it into a burger again to me is sort of taking away from how good it really is on its own but then again I've never tried using it as a topping on anything before.  As far as another crazy over the top option there is such a thing called the John Wayne.  It's a burger that has 3 patties on it of beef, chicken and lamb as the meats with other toppings so it's essentially a kind of burger you really can't pick up and start eating I'd imagine.  I have to say the burger was really good.  The meat patty is definitely hand crafted and the entire thing is a creation.  Ingredients are definitely not skimped and the balance is great.  I loved the Swiss/Blue cheese combo with the creamy and stretchy Swiss with the bold blue.  The house made buns are different as well.  They're branded (I've seen this at a few places) but they seem strong enough to hold onto whatever is going on in between no matter what's inside.  That's important that your special burger doesn't fall apart on you.  My favorite burgers consists of bacon and cheese and while this opera had 2 cheeses they worked well together along with everything else in between.  The burger is juicy while the rest of it just falls into place like it was intended to.    The Mexican poutine was OK but I sort of wish I just had asked for a regular poutine at the time instead.  The onions sort of change the texture of the entire thing and while I'm not really a fan of guac, my wife loves avocado anything so I got it because of her.  I would have been fine with regular curds and gravy as our side.  Since this place is what could be considered gourmet burger territory it cannot be compared to places not of the like.  It's sort of in its own echelon but if I had to compare it to anything like I said it's sort of like what La Belle et la Boeuf would be if there would be a Toronto version of that.  While Toma is good it's rather pricey.  Yes it's a burger with really good ingredients and it's made very well but it's still a burger but it is a whole different level and if you wanted to have an everyday food with high end options it's the place for you.  I know it's definitely not an everyday type place for me however I consider everyday options to be more Wendy's and McD's.  This place is the extreme opposite of that so keep that in mind.  The service was excellent and I'd definitely return to try something else but nothing near the bottom of the menu because I'm not one for 3 patty burgers, foie gras or truffle."}
{"text":"Toma burger addiction has literally just become my new addiction. The brioche buns here are made fresh daily and are nothing short of fantastic.   Came on a Friday night just before 6pm, wasn't too busy so I was happy. Menu has a great selection of gourmet burgers. Went with my girlfriend, she got the \" El diablo \" burger( good ol burger with various toppings such as cheddar bacon pickles etc, with an added chipotle mayo which makes this burger the spicy option). I myself got the \"old fashioned\" which included; cheddar, double smoked bacon( which was the BEST BACON I've ever tasted) jack Daniels caramelized onions and toma secret sauce. For only 5$ more I got the wagyu beef patty instead of the traditional ground beef patty. I've had bad experiences with wagyu beef burgers in the past at restaurants like Bier market, but fortunately for me the wagyu at toma was so smooth and had an amazing flavour. I recommend anyone coming here to upgrade!   Service was great, knew we hadn't been here before so they were very helpful with questions. Also had a pretty decent drink menu, shakes were a little over priced in my opinion, but tasted great so can't complain too much.   All in all I think I've found my favourite new burger place! Give it a try"}
{"text":"The buns here and the quality of the patty meat is incredible! I live close by and always keep a lookout for when they have their classic burger as the monthly special. Otherwise it is quite pricey here, be prepared to spend $20+ for a combo. I have only tried the classic as I am someone who sticks with what they know and love, the fries are also delicious as well. Service is pretty slow, every time I order take out it takes 20 minutes to get my order by I am ok with that since the quality of the burger is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Walked in here for a quick lunch, I was a little surprised to see that Toma seemed like a nice sit down restaurant although it is still a burger joint. Sort of reminded me a little of W Burger Bar but quieter.   I was one of 2 tables being occupied so service was quick, and I just ordered The Classic burger with added mushrooms and I have to say it was an amazing meal. I was a little worried that my lack of a side order would leave me wanting, but at the end the one burger filled me up just fine! They say that they make the bun fresh daily and it adds so much to the overall experience. I rarely indulge in red meat anymore but I'm glad that this foray back in to it didn't leave me with too much regret thanks to a wonderful meal.  I don't really have much else to say other than it was a simple tasty meal that didn't leave a big mess while munching on it. I do get the feeling that this 5 star experience is mainly because it took me by surprise at how good the burger was especially considering that I hadn't heard of toma prior to wandering in here. Not sure if I'd want to go $20 (or $25) for their higher end offerings since I like my burgers simple but with lots of available seating and comfy booths to sit at I'd choose toma again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"OK. Yup- the fries suck. They suck so hard. You WILL feel bad about ordering them so don't. I've ordered poutine here for $9 and it's tiny and soggy and awful and the portion is really small compered to Smoke's/Poutini's. Generic gravy from a bag and the cheese is definitely rolled processed cheese made to look like curds. Yeck.   The burgers are REALLY tasty though. So SO tasty. I always get El Diablo or the Old School burger and I love it! So that's good. I love a hefty, delicious from-scratch burger. And that's what keeps me coming back for more...  I wish I could get better value by having some nice fries with my burger!!"}
{"text":"Great burger - Great Price - FREE Delivery! Buns are delicious, better tasting and higher quality then Burger Priest."}
{"text":"Let's start where I always start. Decor and service. The decor is pleasant -- it's neutral, modern and fresh. The server was friendly and checked in on me regularly. I ordered a classic burger with fries. First the burger -- not bad but not outstanding. The bun was fresh but average -- nothing special. Truly tasted like buns you would purchase from Loblaws. The patty was good but again not special. The fries looked liked and tasted like they had been sitting around a while. They were more like \"bits\" with no fry measuring more than half of an inch. I wouldn't order them again. There are a lot of condiment and add on choices. They have beer on tap. Wine and cocktails. I'll give it one more try [visited on a Monday] but I will need to see a bit more next time."}
{"text":"I can see why they call it Toma Burger Addiction. They should place a rehab clinic next door! The prices were a bit steep but the burgers were fantastic. The service was friendly, attentive and prompt. Great place to get your munchies dealt with!"}
{"text":"I can't even tell you how the burger is... Still waiting for it. Was told it would be ready in 15 min and we're now going on 20 min with a number of people still ahead to be served."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner.  Below is what we ordered. The burgers were ok.  The bun was good and fresh.  Which is nice.  It was a tad on the smaller side but because we shared the large poutine, it was filling.  I must say that the poutine is better than the burgers.  The gravy was amazing as well as the caramelized onions and bacon added great flavour.  Generally I would add ketchup to my poutine but it wasn't even needed.  (BTW they make their own ketchup which is an additional charge).  I would probably come back for the poutine (maybe not the burger). Staff was really nice and helpful.  We had one of the booths which is very comfy.

{"text":"Toma is one of those places where the great food does not match the service. I'm not saying the service is bad, but it definitely needs to step up.  I've tasted two burgers here: El Diablo and The Wild One and I prefer the latter-- the flavor is full and the size is perfect.  Another winner here is the Toma poutine. It's an absolute must-try if you're going to this place.  I could've given a higher rating, but the service lagged the food's high quality."}
{"text":"The Burgers are pretty good. Service is extremely terrible and the servers are rude. Wait times are ridiculous too.  Also, don't order take out from their YP online service. It doesn't work. You'll place an order, show up for it, and they will not have received it. You can still order it while there of course. But you're stuck waiting another 30 mins in there. Best to call ahead or use Door Dash.  You only get 2 stars for the burgers. Fries are junk."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here. I hate the fries, but the burgers are so good, I'll still give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"My buddy and I decided to go on a food adventure and try this new place....great pick by me :)  I saw them on Instagram and was soon a big fan of everything they do.  They make their own buns, sauces, compotes, everything.  It's a nice little place that has been decorated nicely yet simple.  The one thing i picked up right away was their marketing.  Everything was marketed very well right down to the name itself; Toma Burger Addiction....addiction it was lol  The prominent words on the front cover of their menu were: Burger, Addiction, Delicious....see what I mean by how they market?   We were greeted by probably one of the best servers I have had in awhile.  She's a girl from France who moved to Toronto in April, well she is definitely a hard working girl who has a good eye....keep her Toma! She's the type who will give you more water without you asking and always smiling.  We ordered the Wild Life and Monster burgers with truffle fries and a roasted garlic aioli....just writing that out made me drool for more of their food....I am such a fat kid.  Anyways everything was peeeeeerfect!  my friend even mentioned that the structure of the whole burger was intact throughout the whole meal....i nicknamed him \"The Architect of Burgers\".  It was not messy, sloppy or anything...well engineered burger.  We will 1111000000% come back here many times and i am just going to say this is one of the best burgers i have had in the city....so go get some of it now!  Well down guys keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Burgers here have no flavour at all. My burger had way too much mayo, that's all I could taste. And the buns are terrible"}
{"text":"Completely Scratch my previous review out. I was a nub and my taste buds were still developing.  I went there again and they have Kobe beef which I have never seen anywhere else!   my burger juicy but not greasy, beef was very tender and equally tasty. My friends ordered different burgers and all of them loved it.  Their shakes are pretty good too.  5 Stars for service: I actually didn't order the burger with Kobe beef, i ordered a different burger but asked my server to take out everything made with pork meat, she asked what would i like it substituted with and I didn't have anything in mind, then she suggested that she will upgrade my patty to Kobe beef.  I'll definitely be going back to try their different menu items."}
{"text":"* Meat to bun ratio for a single patty leaves you with enough extra bread to feed the birds.  * Plain Fries were less than plain. Tasted like oven baked McCain fries.  * Meat was tasty and juicy, but a little too juicy that it drips to make it tricky to eat.  * Server and space was fantastic.  * Paid $13 to eat in for just the burger + drink but it was $10 to with for the same thing + a pop, which wasn't communicated to me. Would have loved to know this before ordering and I would have taken it to go and ate at trinity bell woods park next door!   Was considering 1 less star for this, but the rating is solely based on the taste of the burger + fries."}
{"text":"Decent burgers (el rio grande was ordinary, but the wild life (mushrooms) was amazing), great poutine with crispy fries, but the music was horrible."}
{"text":"The single piece of foie gras as thin as the bacon. Really not worth the price. Don't think will go again."}
{"text":"I've tried the same thing several times here at Toma. Go here if you like really interesting french inspired flavours on your burger. The patty/meat quality is good, but there are better around town. When I eat this burger I taste the whole package, not the meat in the burger.  T H E   W I L D   L I F E beef patty, swiss cheese, cremini mushrooms, truffle mayo, arugula, double smoked bacon, truffle olive oil, balsamic glaze  + the Truffle-Oil fries. Lots of people here have written that they don't like them. They are a bit soggy and such, but I like them.  It's like potpourri when I get it home.  The bun, which they brand with a T, is okay but should be improved. It tends to squish down or crumble if you don't eat the burger right away. Maybe they need two buns, one for the restaurant and one for take-out.  Service is pretty slow. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to get my burgers sometimes."}
{"text":"Food is like fashion: There are trends, and some of the trends are good and become staples and others fade and disappear. Hot Dog restaurants are the fading fad. As much as one might think the popularity of the great American food would make it a sure-fire hit and an automatic in being the new successful restaurant idea, it has never really taken off. Maybe it's because the hot dog is limited in how much you can diversify it or maybe it's because it's most commonly found in food stands at half the price a restaurant would offer it at. Either way it's never been a big hit at any level above the ballpark.   The burger however, has enjoyed more of an appreciation through the public's tastebuds and thus a far greater speak as the main focus of popular restaurants and broad street appeal. But in the opinion of this reviewer, I feel like that too is on the decline and has already reached its apex. It's this opinion that has led me to give Toma 3 Stars.  I'll qualify the 3 Stars. On the one occasion I went to Toma, I'll be honest, it was delicious. The burger was cooked well and was juicy, the beef was of good quality, the toppings tasty, the fries with aoili browned to golden crispy perfection. But the problem nowadays is that, it's already been done. The service was fantastic, our waitress was polite, attentive and honest in her suggestions of what was good in the menu. The restaurant was clean, had just enough TV's not to over do it, and the steady stream of clients told me that this was a place that took pride in their food and making a good burger. Everything was good. But that's about where I'd leave it. It wasn't the best burger I've ever eaten. It wasn't spectacular (although the bun was a nice fresh sour dough style bread. High marks for that). The size of the patty was just right. My reason for not going to 4 stars is that I guess I'm growing a bit wary of so many burger joints popping up. The idea is not special anymore. It's been done. And it's not that Toma doesn't do it well, or that they don't do it better than anyone else, it's just the trickle down effect of over saturation. Toma is a victim of its own success.  Should you go here? I'd say it's worth the trip. They had a good special in pitchers of Mill St or Steam Whistle for $12.99, the burgers were a decent price especially considering its location, and like I said, the service was excellent. But at the end of the day, it's just a burger."}
{"text":"Toma burgers are good. They have unique combinations and it all tastes very fresh and made to order. They have monthly burger special which makes it a good deal. The bun is thick but very soft. I believe it's made on site. The only thing holding me back is the price. I guess when you compare to walhburger, it's better. Who would've thought you'd be paying $15 for a burger."}
{"text":"Toma has been on my list of places to try for quite some time, and last night I found myself with not enough time to try the BBQ joint down the street. The girl working at Toma told me she could have my burger to me within 10 minutes, so it was a life savior as I was embarking on a long journey to grandma's house (true story)! They had a $6.99 \"Cheesy\" takeout special, so I went for that for simplicity's sake. It was good, and definitely cheesey, but the meat was a little more well done than I like. A good burger, but not life-changing. I think there's other burger spots in Toronto that I prefer if I'm in a burger mood."}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint in Toronto. While it may not beat Umami Burger, which I'm sure it gets its inspiration from, it does a helluva job nonetheless. Delicious. Close enough to my moms place to walk to, and priced just about right. I wish it had a bar inside, but I can't complain. I recommend this place and my recommendation is the most worthy of all. Whenever I'm in Toronto i'm stopping in.   I would have taken a picture and shown you all the pretty looking burger but I ate it all while trying to open the camera app. Next time I'll do better."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service !  The place is also very neat and clean! A tad expensive but still worth it.  You have to try their side \"toma poutine\"."}
{"text":"Went to this burger place after work and surprise to see it empty.  I am not a fan of wait service for a burger joint or eating a burger with a knife and fork, but I decided to stay, since I was curious about their burger.  Ordered \"The Classic\" with fries.  The burger was disappointing, the meat was dry and over cooked.  I didn't like the bun either, it was a little dense and heavy for me.  Food 2/5 Service 3/5 Ambiance 4/5  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Definitely the best burgers in T dot! We had the cheeseburger and Old School and they were both equally amazing on in-house Brioche buns... The taste is SO good, better than Heros, Dangerous Dans, Burger Priest, etc..."}
{"text":"Overrated. If you've never been invited to a BBQ there's a slight chance the burgers here will hit the spot. Otherwise expect disappointment. The burgers as is are pretty bland and you need to pay extra for basic toppings. The \"portobello\" substitute for vegetarians is about 1/3 the size of the already small bun.   The fries...Ugh. The poutine ... Double ugh.   Save your money all."}
{"text":"\"Toma\" roughly translated means \"take it\" in Spanish. And my advice to anyone would be to order your burger and \"take it to go\". While the interior of the restaurant is somewhat nice, the decor really doesn't suit a burger joint. The tables remind me of granite kitchen counters and with the TV blaring a rerun of The Simpsons, I quickly changed my order from sit-down to take out.  The burgers themselves are wonderful. Yes the meat in a burger has to be good however keeping all that goodness and size between the bun is what makes for an enjoyable experience. Toma has got the bun, right!  There are many variations on one beef patty or two and the plain old Cheeseburger, with that smoky bourbon BBQ sauce they put on it, is wonderful. It adds a lot of flavor without overpowering the rest of the toppings. Their signature poutine is also excellent.   Service could have been a bit better and a little quicker, but overall it was bearable. The burgers are about the best I have tasted in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Good burgers but don't ever get them delivered off of Just Eat. Food arrived soggy and just not very appetizing. They also way overcharge for a \"large\" fries. Most restaurants know how to vent steam in the delivery containers by now, I'm surprised these guys haven't figured it out. I won't be returning to these guys."}
{"text":"Classe et raffiné, Toma Burger saura vous séduire à coup sûr avec un choix de burgers aussi original que délicieux. Du végé-burger au boeuf de Kobe sans oublier le fameux steak Angus absolument fabuleux! Beaucoup de \"fait maison\", petits pains, frites, sauces ou shooter vodka-caramel... Avec savoir-faire et bonne humeur, ce couple de charmants français et leur équipe vous réservent un repas des plus agréable! Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Buns are made fresh daily and they are amazing. Service trends to be a little slow but I've only been after 8:00pm. El Rio Grande and the Dream Come True are both excellent. I wouldn't recommend the fries though. They're tiny stubs that are overdone every time I've been."}
{"text":"The ingredient were good but I think the buns where to thick and where over powering the taste. Don't get me wrong, as higher end burger it was better than many chain burger shop, but within its league it is just average."}
{"text":"Terrible portions on the burgers, as well as the burgers being so overcooked and dry I could hardly finish it. Will 100% not return here, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Toma reminds me of the home of my previous favorite gourmet burger 'n fries from Twigs, a small regional chain in the pacific NW, as both made me feel like I should deduct a star from all prior reviews of other places, and both have woefully mediocre ratings on Yelp.   Getting there and finding parking was a bit of a nightmare, even though we managed to snag a spot right in front on our second pass. I worried anything less than a spectacular meal would make the venture feel like more trouble than it was worth.   My fear subsided when we entered a small, attractive restaurant with spacious leather booths and cozy pillows.  By the time I took a sip of my \"bourbonade,\" a concoction of bourbon, lemonade, lime and mint, I knew everything would be just fine.  \"Is it not good?\" The bartender Gerard asked, concerned. I can only assume he mistook the tears in my eyes for displeasure. I quickly assured him it was wonderful. Surprisingly refreshing, and just what I needed.  My husband and I shared a large order of truffle fries but small would have been adequate. Truthfully, the truffle oil is a bit much toward the bottom of the dish, but I loved the fries. They are good alone, but magic in garlic aioli.  I had the cheesy sans onions. The burger was juicy despite being medium and the house-made brioche bun was excellent. My husband had the old timer, and enjoyed it. My sons had kids' meals but didn't come close to finishing because they're actually normal sized burgers.   In fact, food here is a great value overall. Portions are very generous. Service is thoughtful and excellent, and sustainability an appreciated focus.  If they expand, I hope their next location is Niagara Falls."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Toronto! Enjoyed every bite! Also are very friendly to families (-:"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Toma Burger Addiction.  It's been in our 'hood for a couple years and I've been wanting to check it out.  I ordered The Cheeseburger, without lettuce.  I substituted cheddar cheese for mozzarella di Bufala (for an extra $1.99).   Their brioche buns are baked fresh daily in-house and branded with a \" T \".  The patties are made using a blend of fresh ground beef, chuck and brisket, seasoned  with sea salt, ground pepper and a special blend of spice, and cooked to the order on their flat griddle.  It was a delicious burger ... the bun was soft and the patty was tender and juicy.  Chelsea was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Burger is incredible with lots of options for toppings/substitutions! Even the burger bun exceeded expectations. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Nice change of pace in the burger restaurant atmosphere,  but not pretentious.  I had the old school burger.  Quality in ingredients is evident .  Delicious BBQ sauce which I'll assume is made in-house.  Patty was a bit small, but juicy and perfectly cooked.  Loses points for the poutine-  gravy was salty and flavour was not for me.  Seasoning in gravy tasted like all spice.  To each is own though.  I'll return to try other items."}
{"text":"Wow!    We have had a bad streak of restaurants while visiting Toronto over the last 2 years. That streak is over.  I had the El Diablo and it was fantastic. Some of the best caramelized onions I've ever had and the chipotle mayo is a winner.   I will return."}
{"text":"The perfect burger. Ordered the dream come true burger and substituted the beef with lamb and let me tell you this burger did not disappoint. It was well put together and did not fall apart while I ate it which is always nice. We also ordered mozzarella sticks which were well done and came with a great dipping sauce. Overall this place is great and I would come back. Lots of seating and quick service."}
{"text":"honestly i think this place makes the best burgers in toronto. i've been coming for 2 years and they are very consistent with their quality. the flavors are focused and the brioche bun is so good. their burgers don't get greasy like burger's priest. i like to get their take out special every month. i don't recommend getting their fries for take out though. they're thin cut and will get soggy and cold fast. definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Great burger. I had the Old School. It had a lot of flavour! Also very good portion size."}
{"text":"Very pricey 25 dollars for a single patty burger and had to walk to the back and get the cashier to take my order"}
{"text":"Service : 5/5   Everyone was very nice and I think the manager or owner there was fairly attentive in getting people's order.   Food: 5/5  Very good I got the one with blue cheese and had lamb instead of ground beef, very delicious.   Price: 4/5  The price is kind of up there but justifiable when it's handcrafted burgers and the great service."}
{"text":"among the best burger joints in Toronto. Pound for pound, it's worth every dollar. our waitress Victoria even put on the football (conference playoff) game for us. we love coming back here."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Toma Burger Addiction for the first time tonight. We almost passed by, but I'm so glad we didn't.  Why did we almost pass by, you ask? Well, we had already had dinner (at a burger restaurant, in fact!), and we were looking for a place to grab drinks. This place looked great (and had a half-price pint special), but it was a restaurant and we felt bad not ordering food.  We ended up going in. Our server (who also co-owns it, we later learned) was so nice. She brought us two pints. After our appetites failed to increase, she put no pressure on us to get food.  The menu looked great and I look forward to trying it next time, but I have to say it was her attentiveness and friendliness that really impressed me.  Despite our measly order, she was continually refilling our water and checking on how we were. At the end, she even gave us two shots with a caramel liqueur (I think) that was so good. She said it was a recipe from her native France.  I should also mention, the environment of this place is great. It follows a tasteful red, white and black colour scheme. There's a lot of attention to detail too, such as pillows placed in each booth.  I highly recommend Toma Burger Addiction. I admit I haven't tried most of the menu (none of the food, in fact), but I was so impressed by the service we received and the experience we had. This place deserves a lot of success.  I will be back, and next time for an actual meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent juicy burger, lots of choice toppings, and a perfect soft bun. Unlike most gourmet burgers the buns did not turn to mush from the juicy burger. And this place has enough seating to sit larger groups."}
{"text":"Based on delivery quality food: soggy, wet, and gross. If you like crispy, scrumptious, flavourful burgers, then this place is not for you. The lettuce was soggy! No tomato. Just gooey and chewy. The chicken one was not crispy. I really regret choosing this place. The dive corner $5.99 burger place on my block has better quality. Onion rings are like cardboard (they stand upwards), with unnecessary Parmesan. Also specify if you want ketchup or anything on the side cause they are not smart enough to include it. Skip it. 2/10"}
{"text":"Toma Burger lives up to its reputation. The burgers are slow to come out but it is definitely worth the wait. Don't forget to ask for the homemade condiments its waaay better. The owner and chef comes in at 4am to make the buttermilk buns with the signature \"T\". The truffle fries are so salty but delicious. Highly recommend! Where else can you go to a burger joint but also have a glass of wine?!"}
{"text":"Toma is an elegant diner that serves up burgers with a bit of pizazz. Presentation is one of their strengths. On my one and only visit here so far, the service was definitely above average (when compared to other restaurants that serve a similar customer base). The dining area is pleasantly warm and inviting.  There is plenty of variety on the menu, so you'll probably find a burger that suits your tastebuds without too much deliberation. The Boheme was a delicious choice. The french fries could possibly be improved, but overall the meal was quite satisfying.  Must-try item: The milshakes are absolutely amazing here and are enough to bring me back.  One of the bonuses of this Queen West gem is that you can dine in and enjoy the licensed bar, or take your meal to go. The classic burger will only set you back $7 (takeout only). This is one of those places you can bring friends to, or better yet enjoy all by yourself. The burgers are substantial and made very well. It can get a tad pricey but they're definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger and didn't want to go out and get one. So I turned to Just Eat and ordered from a restaurant about 10 minutes away that they recommended, and that place pulled a bait-and-switch - once they realized the order was small, I suddenly became \"not in their service territory.\"  Then I turned to Yelp and they recommended Toma.  Dear g/d that was a good burger. I don't even much care for their style of french fries and I ate every single one and could'a licked the wrapper. They were even well early of their delivery time estimate, and they have a secure pin-based ordering system that ensures no neighbour yoinks your dinner.   My only objection is that their \"free\" delivery has a minimum order of $20, which because their prices are fairly reasonable is steep for one person. Well, I have enough cans of soda to get me through work tomorrow now. :)"}
{"text":"How do I put this?  Toma Burger Addiction will raise your opinion of the French.  Recently opened significantly further West on Queen West than most people want to go for a burger these days, Toma has the misfortune to be situated on a strip that's exploded with burger joints.  That's a shame, because of all the new offerings Toma's the most unique, and perhaps the most remarkable.    The words \"French\" and \"burger\" have never really gone together in my mind before, but the burgers at Toma are outstanding; the service is attentive, but not overbearing; and the atmosphere's relaxed, clean, inviting, and high-end, all of which defies the comparatively cheap prices.  The quality of the ingredients is unparalleled, and the focus is largely on harmony and simplicity instead of the (deliciously) obscene offerings of all-bacon patties and grilled cheese sandwich buns that define my other Toronto favorite, Holy Chuck.  Toma's burger subtlety done right; every burger here's a sublime experience on a brioche milk bun.  And oh, that bun.  Light, fluffy, but strong enough to stand up to the juicy beef, gooey cheese, and moist compotes, the bun's the first big difference that sets Toma apart from its competitors.  While the lack of a gluten free option limits the audience, the bun's just beyond reproach.  The beef's easily the most flavorful I've ever found in a burger in this city.  Terms like \"angus\" and \"rib eye\" get thrown around a lot in the burger game, but let's be honest: the result's usually a bland burger that, if flavorful, is usually more spice and seasoning than anything else.  Not the case here!  The angus patties at Toma are cooked to order, but arrive perfectly pink unsolicited, as they should.  They're thick, but not inedibly so, and while the meat's juicy they aren't an explosive mess of meat like Priest and Chuck will often serve if you don't specify cooking instructions.  The meat's just so flavorful: fire grilled and carrying hints of carbonized deliciousness, but perfectly tender.  I could continue babbling about the patties but I'd really just be repeating myself.  It's the best beef I've ever had in a burger.  The toppings are killer, too.  Permit me to elucidate:  El Diablo - 9.99 - Covered with gooey Swiss cheese that arrives melted and slightly stringy, the El Diablo's adorned with double smoked bacon, caramelized onions, spinach, and chipotle mayo.  Yes, chipotle mayo; the bane of the culinary world.  Luckily this isn't the orange garbage that was so ubiquitous in 2012!  This is a product of love: homemade mayo delicately tempered with the heat of chipotle.  The bacon's cut super-thick and cooked firm - not Five Guys crisp, but not fatty or floppy either - it's delightful.  The onions are perfectly caramelized and portioned, adding to the flavors without overpowering the taste or texture of the burger.  This was the first thing I had at Toma, and it's what made me fall in love with the place.    The Wild Life - 12.99 - Another burger bearing that perfectly melty Swiss cheese and double smoked bacon, the Wild Life comes with arugula, mushroom compote, truffle mayo, and a balsamic glaze.  The balsamic plays really nicely with the mayo and the cheese, and if, like me, you find a pile of mushrooms to be a bit much, the mushroom compote on this thing is what you've been waiting for all your life.  This burger's stupendous.  I'm going to have a hard time picking between this and the El Diablo on future visits.  The Neapolitan - 12.99 - This burger's good, but it's a step behind the other two.  The Neapolitan uses a wisely-selected buffalo mozarella, arugula, olive oil, prosciutto, and the house-made San Marzano ketchup.  The cheese overpowers everything else a bit, and the texture of the prosciutto doesn't really work since it's chewier than everything else.  It's solid, but not great.  That said, the San Marzano ketchup deserves kudos all its own.  I'm used to being let down by house-made ketchups, but this one's great.  It's subtle, so I feel weird calling out individual flavor notes, but it's got the sweet and salty ketchup flavors you'd expect, underlined with some spicy overtones of something that might be cinnamon?  I don't know.  But It's awesome on all the burgers, and it's stellar with the fries.    The fries are topnotch, too.  Perfectly fried shoestrings seasoned with enough salt and greenery to bring out the potato flavor, they're an excellent accompaniment.  Skip the truffle fries and go with the regular ones or the poutine; drowning that taste in truffle oil is wholly unnecessary.   Toma's awesome, and a must-eat for burger fans.  As crowded as the burger scene might be in Toronto right now, this place is doing something different and competing on a wholly different level.  AND they're doing it with sincere service and no pretension!  I really hope Toma's location doesn't put it out of business, because it's an absolute treasure."}
{"text":"Toma burger addiction was delicious. The burgers are amazing and the buns are freshly homemade which makes the burger even better! Great menu variability (beef, chicken, lamb patties) and the service was exquisite. Recommended place."}
{"text":"The burgers here are amazing and definitely the star of their menu (as it should be given that this is a burger joint) . The service was great as well. Super attentive server , friendly and the food came out in a decent time. The four stars instead of 5 is for the lack of quality sides . We got the large fries, they were just okay . Huge portion but not that great. We also got Caesar salad. I don't recommend the salad as it they used powdered parmesan cheese and kraft dressing.  The burger and the service def puts this the 4 category they just need to work on sides."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing drinks. I would come back anytime to eat the best burgers in Toronto! They are so tasty, you won't ever want to eat another burger anywhere else! Excelent service too!"}
{"text":"Have read some great things about Toma Burger Addiction (@Tomaburger). Yet another burger joint on Queen West and this one bought to you by French Chef Thomos Sedille. Toma was promised to offer burger with a French twist from daily handmade brioche style milk buns to slow-cooked compotes inspired by traditional French recipes. Almost all ingredients are made in house from their sauces, compotes, chutneys and Canadian Angus prime ribs patties.  I didn't bring my camera that day, so those are from my iphone.  Spiced Pear Mojito $9 ~ This have a real kick to it, so if you can't handle hear please don't order this. ~ I find the pear paired incredible with the heat and the mint.  ~  Definitely something different but a very easy drinking cocktail.  The Perfect Wedding $12.99 ~ Angus beef, Spanish Chorizo, Homemade pear compote, Gorgonzola, sprouts, caramelized onions, walnut ~ Love sweet and savory combination but this is way too sweet with the sweet milk bun and the huge amount of compote.  ~ Not sure if it's the ratio of all the ingredients or not but it didn't really help highlight the amazing patty which was very moist and flavorful.  ~ And did I mention the milk bun was amazing which I won't mind eating it on it's own all day long.   The Double Jackpot $24.99 = The Fabulous Las Vegas $19.99 + Foie Gras $8.99 ~ Kobe Wagyu beef patty, brie cheese, truffle mayonnaise, caramelized onions, sprouts, truffle olive oil, fleur de sel ~ Their Instagram account actually commented on my picture saying Kobe and Wagyu are the same thing and they get them from a USA farmers.  ~ But Kobe beef is wagyu but wagyu is not necessarily kobe.  ~ It can basically only called Kobe beef if it actually come from Japan.  ~ So the one from US can only be called Wagyu, a kobe-style beef; so I don't think it can be called Kobe Wagyu.  ~ We also waited for our burgers for more than 45 minutes and according to our waitress, it was because the Wagyu burger takes longer to cook...I wonder why it's any different than a regular one?  ~ If you ask me that's a way too long wait for a burger given that I expected to get in and out within one hour.  ~ Plus the patty was dry and overcooked, we both agreed that the regular Canadian Angus prime rib patty was way more flavorful and moist. This was definitely not worth the extra money, I would rather add the Foie Gras for $8.99 to any of their regular burger instead.  Truffle French Fries $6.99 ~ Free with any burger for your first check in on foursquare. + TOMA secret sauce Add $0.99  Verdict : ~ Will come back just because I love their milk bun ~ But def no Wagyu Burger for us next time. ~ With their long wait / turnover time, not sure how competitive they are compare to all the amazing  Burger joint in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I ordered delivery from Toma.  The first thing my boyfriend said after a couple bites was, \"this is the best burger bun I've ever tasted!\" and he was right!  The bun's are soft and taste like freshly baked bread.  I saw later on their website that they advertise that they make them daily in-house.  The burgers were great -- very juicy without being greasy at all!  Fries, onion rings, and chipotle mayo -- all great.  Also we got milkshakes - delivered! - and they were AWESOME.   \"Addiction\" is very accurate."}
{"text":"We had \"The Wild Life\" and my bf had \"The Dream Come True\"... We shared the Toma Poutine - everything was amazing!!! We were a larger group of 9 who came in without a reservation, and received really great service. He was friendly and helpful and patient! Hands down, better than Burger Priest or most of the other hyped up burger joints which have popped up lately. None of the flavours over powered anything else, though my patty was ever so slightly bland.  The pretzel buns, which are freshly baked in-house were amazing and a perfect compliment to their patties and toppings! We will definitely be back!"}
