{"text":"Went between 3pm-4pm when apparently wait staff is switching.  We felt pretty unwelcome since the 2 waitresses were basically discussing who would get the (apparent displeasure) of waiting on us.  I've waited tables many times in my life, I know how this works.  Girls if you are going to do this, it's best to NOT do it openly in front of the customers.  Have some class.  Or perhaps get a job that you actually like.    Other than that, the nachos were really good and were huge. Great guac.  After being turned off by the wait staff, that is all we ended up ordering.  We almost drank our water and left.  Sorry but I just strongly believe that good customer service can make or break a place......"}
{"text":"This place had some trouble starting up, as is seen in older reviews. However, they've gotten ALOT better. Fiance and I had a full meal with drinks and dessert, and the food was alot better than I expected it to be. What stood out most to me were a)the way they put their own tasty spin on menu items, and b) the mussels. OMG the mussels, they are fantastic! It was a little overpriced, but I will go back."}
{"text":"Edit:  Just received word that this is the location where Michael Symon is opening his new B-Spot.  Very excited to have this at Crocker.    I ate there only once and it is not a favorite.    Food Rating 1 Margaritas 4 Service 3 Ambiance 3 Cost 3  There are much better places to eat at Crocker Park.  I might go back if it is just for drinks but never again for the food."}
{"text":"Agave is an average Mexican restaurant in Crocker Park. The atmosphere is very trendy, which I actually like. There are two areas of the restaurant, the main dining room and the bar area. The restaurant feels very spacious. Mexican artwork is all over the walls, and the artwork is pretty good. Now for the food. You're served chips and salsa just like at most Mexican restaurants. I thought the chips were too salty, but the salsa was really good. It had a refreshing taste to it. It wasn't too spicy, but just right (I'm also not a big fan of really spicy food). Someone at our table ordered the guacamole to share. I thought the guacamole was really good. There were tomatoes and feta cheese in it, which I thought worked really well. I ordered the Cuban Sliders and shared the California Burrito with someone else. The Cuban Sliders were good, but not great. They had pulled pork, cheddar cheese, cole slaw, pickles, mayo, and mustard on them. They came with fries, which were pretty good. It felt really out of place in a Mexican restaurant though. If they had been excellent, I wouldn't have cared about them being out of place. The California Burrito had kind of a funky taste to it. It wasn't terrible, but again, it wasn't great. It had steak, rice, beans, cheese, lettuce, guacamole, salsa, & sour cream. I just couldn't figure out what about it tasted weird, but it did. Overall, Agave is a place that if I was invited to go there, I would, but I would never go there on my own. There is better Mexican food to be had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food I ever tasted. I wished that I went to Taco Bell. Whatever you do DON'T EAT THE TILAPIA. It tasted like it was caught in a stream of raw sewage! My wife could only eat a few bites, and then we sent it back. They made a fuss about"}
{"text":"Crocker Park's Agave has some tasty white wine sangria. Yum. It just may be worth $7 a drink. My gentleman caller said the margaritas were good too. Agave is supposedly a tapas menu place with entrees. However, I have found that the \"small plates\" are enough for a meal. Don't load up on several unless you have several people and you want to share. I would suggest one small plate per person...that should be enough for a meal. I liked the nachos. I have a rule about chorizo...I have to order it when I see it. They put chorizo on their nachos. I was powerless."}
{"text":"Agave is my favorite place to go at Crocker Park with my girlfriends or on a date. While the food and cocktails are mediocre at best ( and trust me, I'm Mexican ) the ambiance and service makes up for it.  The food isn't terrible but it's not authentic and the margaritas are weak although the pomegranate margarita is quite yummy. They also happen to have prime real-estate as far at their patio is concerned during the summer time and for those of you who are from the area we all know that patio cocktails at Crocker park are a must."}
{"text":"I was hoping to enjoy the fantastic rum bar that Agave had on their website menu. So we got there, got seated and were handed cocktail menus with extensive lists of rums and tequilas. I took about ten minutes mulling over the list. Upon deciding what kind of rum mojito I wanted to try, our waitress told us that because they are relocating the only rum that they currently had was Bacardi and Captain Morgan. I have those at home, thank you. Maybe you should have informed me when you handed me the menu that you didn't have 90% of it in stock. So we gladly left and went to Momocho instead. Much better choice. You should do the same. Ohio City isn't that far.  P.S. - I only gave Agave one star because Yelp made me. I wish I could have given it zero."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this location as I'm on a personal mission to hit every Mexican establishment in NEO... and this one looked great from the outside.. but that's pretty much the high point.  The Look.    I had the following: Mojito (BLAH) Guacamole (YUMMM) Chimichanga (BLAH!Ick!EHH!) Rice(Hello No Flavor) and house Salsa (WTF was that?)   I would have given this place an even lower rating execpt for three things... 1. The Atmosphere - i like the decor. 2. The Guacamole - I might actually go back just for Chips and Guac. 3. The Waitress - She was brutally honest with us after we ate, and even recommended other places to try in the area."}
{"text":"totally unimpressed. nachos were good, but the margaritas were so weak they tasted like kool-aid. i tried two different kinds before switching to corona - my \"on the rocks\" margarita was 80% ice. service left a lot to be desired. can't say i'm dying to come back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Mexican place in Cracker Park (that's right, I SAID IT). Some friends and I went in the afternoon -- it was pretty empty, and the service was quick. We all ordered a bunch of different items and shared. The chimichanga was fine, but the real treats were the fish tacos and, most shockingly, the wings, which were straight-up some of the best I've ever had. Not your normal type of BBQ-slathered wings, but deep-fried with a very complex flavor. I would have ordered more drinks, but it was, like, one in the afternoon, and my mother raised me classy and not to get wasted until at least 4."}
{"text":"I think Agave's is a typical restaurant \"shopping center\" restaurant.  You wouldn't go out of your way to eat here.  But if you are shopping and get hungry, it's a good place to go.  Very trendy interior design, food is supposed to be Latin American inspired.  The chips are thick and the salsa has a great smokey flavor.  They have a huge selection of tapas.  I opted for an Ensalada Mexicana which was fresh greens, chiles, huge sticks of jicama, avocado and cilantro served with a lime basil vinaigrette.  I also has the Brazilian crab cakes.  They were blue crab served with mango relish and a dash of chile aioli and mustard drizzle.  All in all the food was pretty good.   I was disappointed that they didn't have tres leches for dessert, but I guess you can't have everything.  Service was very friendly.  Great location for people watching."}
{"text":"Agave is what you would expect a Mexican restaurant in Crocker Park to be.  Decent quality food, if bland and uninspiring, and an ultra trendy atmosphere.  THE ATMOSPHERE:  I usually review the food first, but as food is not the focal point, I'll concentrate on what is obviously the most important thing. The space is really cool.  The front of the restaurant is a giant window, perfect for people watching.  The place is decorated in deep reds and polished wood with cool modern-ish art on the walls.  The effect is more undifferentiated, sexy Latin than Mexican.  THE SERVICE:  Very friendly and responsive.  Our waitress was very pleasant.  THE FOOD:  The quality of the ingredients is very good.  However, this is ultra Americanized Mexican.  Mon cher chou had a burrito, served loosely wrapped, meant to be eaten with a fork and knife.  He said that all the ingredients were very good-- it wasn't as if they used the melange to cover up sloppy preparation.  I had the shrimp fajitas.  There were 8 shrimp on a giant bed of grilled onions and peppers.  The Mexican rice was well made and flavorful.  The guac was serviceable and smooth.  Margueritas were standard.  It blows my mind that more restaurants in Crocker Park don't have kids menus.  Crocker Park!  That paeon to suburbia!  Agave's owners were wise enought to develop a really nice kids menu-- 8 selections, each for $6.  It includes some American food and kids' versions of quesadillas and burittos.  You can choose from one of several sides-- rice, Mexican rice, etc. and FRUIT!!!  How nice not to have to feed your child fries!  The fruit cup was great--albeit miniscule.  There were fresh berries, apples and pineapple.  All in all a decent place to grab a bite if you are not expecting authentic Mexican food, but just want something tasty."}
{"text":"I was devastated when Hoggy's closed because there are few restaurants that are better than Hoggy's. However, this restaurant has done an admirable job of replacing it! This restaurant alone is reason to drive across town to Crocker Park.  The portion sizes of the tapas are surprisingly large. The burrito is big enough for a meal actually. We really enjoyed the wings and the bean dip! My wife and I ordered three tapas between us and we had plenty to take home. Additionally, they gave us unlimited chips and salsa too, despite the fact that I wolfed down the chips in a ravenous manner.   We waited a long time for a table, and waited a long time for our food too (it was a Saturday), but it wasn't bad because there are plenty of TV's to watch sports to pass the time and live music too.   I can't wait to go here again!"}
