{"text":"Service (two stars) -  under staffed as it took five mins for someone to seat us at the bar (we had reservations) and then another five minutes to get attention once seated.  I was ready to walk but we stayed and the service was fine the rest of the way. 

Food (three stars)  - lost all there points in the gnocchi though fluffy they had no flavour.  The Veal Milanese was solid! On the bone and delicious."}
{"text":"Hostaria definitely stands out from most of the Italian restaurants I've ever been to.  The restaurant is simple yet chic and classy. We were welcomed immediately with a nice appreciative welcome.  Service was spectacular. I don't think I've ever been tended to as much as I was at Hostaria.  The owner even introduced himself to us and kept on asking how the food/service was throughout the night.

As soon as we were seated, they gave us complimentary bread, which I could have eaten all by myself. We started by ordering the Polipetti alla Luciana (Baby wild octopus with tomato and capers).  The octopus was cooked perfectly and the tomatoes and capers added just the right touch. 

For my main entrée, I ordered the risotto of the day with homemade sausage, which was delicious. The risotto was hearty without it being too heavy.  And the homemade sausage was divine.  Portion size was good: nothing too big, but definitely enough to keep you satisfied.

Hostaria definitely made my trip to Montreal a whole lot better and wouldn't hesitate on going back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful food, excellent service with a great atmosphere in a  Little Italy eatery ... just perfection. Thank you Hosteria"}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian food. Ate here while visiting Montreal for my birthday dinner with my husband.  Great experience and great food!  We ordered everything from appetizers to entrees to dessert and everything was so yummy!"}
{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday night, arriving a good 20 minutes ahead of our reservation. Parking in the area is difficult but there is a valet, which is always highly appreciable.

What struck me the most was the warmth of the welcome. The bartender immediately offered us prosecco (exactly what I wanted), and an alternative for my partner, who didn't want that at all. One of the owners introduced himself (Aniello), and throughout the evening made sure that all was well.

The decor is simple but classy. I love the idea of the bar, where you can quite happily wait for your table. We had an 8pm reservation but they weren't ready for us till at least 8.15. We didn't mind as we were catching up with our friends. However, the room is just a bit too narrow to enable people to congregate around it, and we felt we were a bit in the way. On the other hand, the staff certainly didn't make us feel like that at all. Everyone was very friendly and warm throughout the evening. I would probably have easily drunk another glass of prosecco though, had it been offered to me, and possibly sampled a few antipasti, had they been offered to me. Just sayin'.

Once we were seated, the most delicious nutty, fruity olive oil and crusty bread were put on the table for nibbling while we perused the menu. I had the polpetti (baby octopus) in a yummy tomato sauce as an appetizer (I expected it to be cold but it was hot, tender, and nicely balanced with tomato and basil). My partner had a simple, very, very fresh Boston lettuce salad dressed with lemon, oil and grated parmesan. Our friends had the parpadelle with the lamb (I think) ragù, and the melanzane parmigiana, both of which were delicious, non greasy, and well balanced.

For mains, I and one of our friends had the braised shoulder of lamb. I love lamb for its strong taste and fatty bits. I was pleased to see they had kept the fatty bits, and it literally fell of the bone. The portion size was substantial too. My partner had the swordfish, which was delicious and had a surprising mix of flavours and textures: the chewiness of the accompanying Italian couscous, and the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes and sultanas it had been cooked with. Our other friend had the spezzatino dell'Hostaria, which was a veal and vegetable stew. I often find veal a bit bland (I like lamb, remember), but this dish had an amazing flavour that made me want to have it myself next time.

I did wish there had been more accompanying vegetables. My meat came with a token potato and broccolini/rapini stalk. The staff even asked us if we wanted an accompanying salad, which we took.

I was quite sure I couldn't eat any more but the basil sorbet sounded like it might help my digestion, so I pushed my indulgence a little further, and am very glad I did. It was delicious!! I had two (very short) espressos to round it all off. With our three glasses of prosecco and a bottle of wine (sorry, can't remember what it was, but it was recommended and was a lovely medium red that went well with everything), the bill came to $345, which I consider to be a very reasonable price for such an excellent meal. Also, it was very late by the time we left (getting on for midnight), which means we ate at a very European, leisurely pace. Since the experience is as much a part of the pleasure as the food, this puts Hostaria way up there for me. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent rien à redire !
Notamment l'huile d'olive, les ingrédients sont frais et très bons. 
J'ai testé en dessert la tarte citronnée, un régal qui est certainement fait maison de À à Z !
Je recommande !"}
{"text":"Though I had heard good things about this restaurant I was not a fan. Though we made reservations, we still ended up waiting over 40 minutes for our table... They kept telling us \"your table is almost clear\". The food itself was just ok. To be honest the menu read a lot better than the food tasted. My pasta with lamb and artichoke had barely any lamb in it and was bland. The highlight was the ricotta chocolate tarte which was dreamy and creamy. For the price, I wouldn't go back. There are plenty other italian restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a truly authentic italian resto....Hostaria is the place to go. Cozy and warm ambiance and excellent top notch service. Food was exceptional packed with flavor and great presentation. Cappuccino too was awesome including their desserts.  Would definately recommend to those looking for a good italian resto."}
{"text":"Why were we the only table at this place? Actually there were two others. Unbelievable authentic Italian.  From the deep fried artichoke appetizer to the mozzarella and tomato salad to my pasta (some very salty fish like anchovy shaved over deliciously-tossed garlicky and olive-oily pasta) to this dessert which was a tart filled with Nutella, I was swooning. Also had the most unusual port. Heavy aroma of spice but not overly so. We were with a native Italian who spoke in their language with the waitstaff and he raved about how good it was. Go! Now!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and the most delicious authentic Italian food in Montreal!  Don't skip the dessert.   The basil sorbet is amazing. You need to eat here."}
