{"text":"It's OK, buy nothing special. I imagine it will give Shoeless Joe's a run, for a while, but their food is better. Food presentation very ordinary. Service was quick and pleasant. Guinness steak and mushroom pie actually quite nice. Ribs were a disappointment. Chicken wings nice and plump and juicy."}
{"text":"I had visited the Brookline pub yesterday and I have to say that it was a great experience.  The interior is very well done, it incorporates both the pub and casual dining atmosphere.  A lot of TV around the restaurant.  The waitress who served us was very nice and recommended the Irish nachos as an appetizer and it was great!!  For the main course I ordered the pulled pork on flat bread and it was very good, a large portion. My husband ordered the rib and wings and he enjoyed them, the ribs were very tender and delicious.  We didn't have much room for dessert but the menu did look very tempting. I would definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome she was knowledgable on menu and was able to read the table. Food: without question the wings were awesome!  Not mammoth but flavour was excellent! Bruschetta: Yummmm  I would and will return"}
{"text":"Have been 4 times now. Food is good, portions are generous and staff friendly. Highly recommend trying them out"}
{"text":"The tables and chairs were a bit crowded together; I had waitresses rubbing against the back of my chair all meal. I asked the waitress if the burgers were hand-made and she said yes.  The burger was definitely not fresh or hand-made (the patty reminded me of the President's Choice frozen burger patties from Superstore). It cost over $60 for an appetizer, nachos, a burger, and a kids burger.  I'll definitely go to Shoeless Joe's or Baldwin Street Burger next time I have a Burger craving."}
{"text":"Food brutally presented and tasted like cardboard. Meal was also incorrect. Server was rude and unprofessional. The only reason I'm giving this a 2 star is because of the nice interior and amount of beers on tap. Huge disappointment for the Brooklin community and for myself as someone who was hoping for hockey and baseball sponsorship."}
{"text":"Very Disappointing lunch.  Had the \"Cajun grilled chicken wrap\" with soup.  The wrap tasted mostly like warm iceberg lettuce.  I'm really not sure how they can call it Cajun  - the sauce tasted like mayonnaise with a drop a barbecue sauce in it. Soup was a jumbled mess of beans, ground beef and bacon - blecch.  My wife's \"Greek salad\" had canned black olives in it, and came out with no dressing on it.  Not a great first impression at all.  While the pub inside is beautifully done, I would only come back for drinks - not the food"}
{"text":"So disappointed. ...  For a brand new pub interior is nice.  Very friendly staff, well laid out and a TV in sight from every angle. Food is a bit of a let down... I have gone back twice to do a review.  First visit we had the entire app menu and it was mediocre at best. The apps are lacking presentation and flavor.  The deep fried pickles were bland as were all the apps.  Bruschetta was a small piece of bread with a few tomatoes on it, not worth the 9.00$  Second visit was a lunch visit and the food was even less enjoyable. Beef dip was like a salt sandwhich, never mind the \"Au jus\" which tasted like brown salty water with unidentifiable white bits in it. The curry flat bread wasn't bad but lacked more ingredients on a huge piece of bread. Stay away from the dips! It's like margarine with dill in it!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I didn't know where to go for dinner. We drove around, ending up in Brooklin. We were just entering their 'downtown' area when we saw the Brooklin Pub. Neither of us come to this little part of Whitby too often, so why not?   It was busy! We sat at the bar while we waited for a table. We only waited about 10min. The staff were friendly and they had an alright beer selection; the usual suspects with a few craft beers and a couple uncommon imports. This is a big place! Each area is sectioned off, making a great place for a large group. It's a sports pub, so you could see a TV from anywhere.   There was a large group seated in our section, so getting in and out of that area was a little tight. Not sure how the servers were getting by with arms full of food and drink! Wings were really popular here; I think at least one person at every table was eating them! The menu was large, so our server came back a few times and we weren't ready.    I ended up choosing the Goat Cheese & Grilled Veggie Flatbread and my friend had a Gourmet Grilled Cheese on multigrain bread with fries. My flatbread was so good! There were veggies on it that I never would have put on a flatbread, like carrot and cucumber. The balsamic made the flavours really pop! I'd get that again! My friend's grilled cheese was so stuffed with tomato, bacon, marble and swiss cheese she couldn't finish it. The fries were ok, nothing special.    Service was great. She was bubbly and sweet. This place has a small town feel and everyone there was there to have a good time, good food and watch a good game."}
{"text":"Great date night at Brooklin Pub. Enough TVs for all to watch the game. Nachos app is huge & very tasty. We shared it and still brought some home. Good choice of beer on tap and not too pricey. Friendly staff & close to home. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"If it I could choose 3.5 stars than I would. Place is clean and great casual atmosphere. Our waitress was very friendly and service was great. We ordered the 9 spice Sri Lankan wings, curry fries and Pad Thai. Wings were very good although it is a dry rub and not spicy hot which I was not expecting. The curry fries didn't have much depth but were still enjoyable. The Pad Thai was definitely not made with traditional flavours, instead it was made with a black bean sauce - it was ok. Good spot if you want to watch a game, lots of tv screens to get together with friends."}
{"text":"This is a decent place because it's one of like two bars in Brooklyn to hang out.  Food is pretty good from what I have tried and drink prices are reasonable.  It's clean here and the bar is clean too. Only thing is that it closes to early.  I recommend the meatballs for a nice filling snack."}
{"text":"I like the Brooklin Pub and it is a nice go-to for anyone in the area. While it does lack the exclusivity or vibrance of a bar downtown, it does offer a nice clean place with friendly staff where you can have a few drinks and have a good time in relative peace.  The interior is nice, and the pub has plenty of TV's. The staff will even change the channel of a certain TV if you ask nicely. Everything is clean and modern looking, and you don't need to worry about anything being dirty or sketchy.   The food is decent. This isn't a Michelin star restaurant and it does not pretend to be. I have tried a few things on the menu and have not been disappointed but nor have I been wowed.   The Brooklin Pub does exactly what it was designed to do, and I love it."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot for wings and two very different types of soup each day. Staff is friendly and service great this is a staple wing spot for me weekly. Not expensive and their daily specials are even better."}
