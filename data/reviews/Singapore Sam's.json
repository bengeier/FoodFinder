{"text":"Omg this place is sad!!! I remember going here when I was a teenager and it was mainly an enjoyable experience. 

It's been years since we've been here and decided to give it a shot. Jeez! The decor hasn't changed and you can tell it's super dated. 

The price for the dinner buffet remains low $13.50 but the food is awful. And in the this case you certainly get what you pay for!  They only have one side of trays half filled with cold mediocre food. 

The \"fresh\" items for the Mongolian grill looks like scraps from the cutting board. These guys are half baked and need to refresh everything about the restaurant or give up!  Also they don't do the candied apple and bananas anymore so 10000000 thumbs down!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it was a bad day or what but I feel like this was a complete waste of money. I couldn't eat much of my dinner, it was all just cold, shriveled and like it had been leftovers and left out for a while. We went around 6 so it was dinner hours.. I felt ill about eating it but I had some of it and it was a mistake.. I ended up getting very sick. The taste and quality of the food was not good, I hope that they improve somehow because it was not good at all. The highchair was also very dirty and I had to wash it myself."}
{"text":"I have posted this review anonymously before because I was wary of the restaurant owners and their affiliations, but I believe it is important that people know how I was treated at this establishment so that it doesn't occur again.

My boyfriend and I tried to use a coupon from the well-known Entertainment Book here- a 2-for-1. The waiter first told us that it didn't apply to late-night menu (same menu...), then threatened to punch my boyfriend in the face when he asked to see proof of said mystical 'other menu'. I'm horrified to say I'm not lying.

We were screamed at, had a mag light flashed in our faces, then were dragged and thrown out the back door. Keep in mind this was not a case of drunken disorder. This was a couple being thrown out for trying to use a coupon.

We called the police, who couldn't do anything, but the officer himself said he would never take his own family to dine at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been to Singapore Sam's many times, and I have never been disappointed. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone that enjoys great Chinese food, fair prices, and exceptional customer service. Amazing."}
{"text":"I had hardly a problem, food was good to the point that I want to eat even though I'll puke haha and came in good time. The only issue that made it 4 stars instead of 5 was because we agreed to pay visa when over phone but when guy came he demanded cash which we didn't have so he found this paper thing and imprinted my gf's credit card number then left, kinda sketchy in my opinion but either than that everything was great"}
{"text":"Arrived at 3:30 am -  I don't know how many times I asked myself \"WTF is going on here?\"  

People that enter these doors collectively decide to forget what is socially acceptable behavior - in a good way.

The floor was littered with food and broken chopsticks.  The tables were stages for customer's blissful dancing to Abba, Madonna, Snap!, and various other cheesy songs.  In any respectable bar or club, those songs are booed and hissed.  At Singapore Sam's, they are celebrated!"}
{"text":"Typical grease laden Chinese Canadian offerings, with a slightly better than average lunch buffet. My main reason for going here is that they are open very late, making it a classic post-bar option. They have a disco ball, music, and sometimes people dance on the tables to keep the party going after hours. Friendly staff, and a private parking lot downtown are nice extras."}
{"text":"This is by far the craziest and most fun restaurant I have been.
Imagine you are eating Asian food at 2 o'clock at night with 80s music playing in the background and everyone not eating either dancing on the table or playing drums with chopsticks. It almost felt like I'm in a human zoo....LOVE IT

When a place is this fun, food is just icing on the cake. Can't complain.."}
{"text":"This was pretty good. Ironically, while sitting there enjoying the free wifi I discovered that the Bistro across the street was actually a pretty damn nice place. Regardless, I was still able to savour the Hawaiian Fried Rice that I shared with a friend. The portions are pretty decent for the price. Pretty average for \"Chinese/Singaporean\" food in Canada. Having been to Singapore and China, I would say that there isn't even that much difference between the food here and there, except in variety and average quality. Most places in Canada have menus that are really hit-and-miss."}
{"text":"Great times!... until tomorrow :(
The atmosphere here is great! Come with friends, sing, dance, fool around, eat yummy food, stumble home, repeat. My entire group got madd heartburn though so take a pre-emptive shot of ant-acid :)"}
{"text":"Coolest late night place to eat I have ever seen. So much fun! I even dumped into an NHL player!"}
{"text":"No, this isn't the best Chinese food in Calgary.
But, where else can you get food so late that isn't Boston Pizza or a pub?
Singapore Sam's owners/managers deserve some kudos for offering us Calgarians something that is hard to come by and that is a place to go after the bars/clubs/pubs shut down at 2ish! They stay open til 3-3:30 AM from Wednesday to Saturday. That is pretty unheard of. I've been there after 2AM and it's a gongshow! So it can be quite hilarious or quite annoying, depending on your mood. They keep the party going on weekends by having the dance music turned up and the disco ball turning so you've been warned.

This isn't where you go for quality Chinese, but you can get your late nite Chinese on and that's worth Yelping about."}
{"text":"Singapore Sams was my \"go to\" place for Chinese food. The last couple of times I ordered from there the quality of food was horrible. My salt and pepper squid was like chewing on a bouncy ball. I called to tell them and they offered me a $20 credit. 
Last night I decided to give them another chance. I placed my order, using my $20 credit (Dinner for 2 $33.95). They then told me my total and I was blown away (almost $40). Because my order was under $30 (would have been $13.95 using my credit) they were going to charge me a $20 delivery fee. This totally defeats the purpose of my credit. Normally my delivery fee is $10 and now they doubled it?!? It makes no sense.  I immediately cancelled my order and ordered from another Chinese food restaurant. 
They are scammers and cheapskates!  Save your money and order somewhere else."}
{"text":"It was after 10pm on a Sunday evening on the way home from the airport and I needed a snack before passing out. On a stop at Last Best for a growler fill, my options were Canadian Pizza, Mac's or Singapore Sam's. Since I was feeling the Asian vibes thanks to multiple Asian airport stopovers, I decided to give this place a go.

I walked inside, and two people were eating plates of typical Chinese (western) fare by themselves, with no staff in sight. But he appeared after a few minutes and in the meantime I'd found a menu (hiding on a lower shelf at the desk if you're in the same position). I was looking for something quick and he assured me that the fried rice would only take about five minutes. Sold.

I chose the Combo Fried Rice ($10.95) with shrimp, chicken and bbq pork. Would I like that spicy? Heck yes. And would I also like some chili oil on the side? I'd never say no. The bonus is that while you're waiting, you get a clear view of the carpark to keep an eye on your vehicle.

A few minutes later he brought out it out ready to go, including chili oil, another spicy sauce and a fortune cookie. The container (typical round aluminum foil) was packed full and there was plenty to share. And it was pretty tasty! I'm not sure I would choose this place over others, but it's a great spot for late night eats."}
{"text":"Stopped here because I was desperate for wifi. I was the only one in the restaurant during dinner time (looks like this is a late-night hangout for drunks). I asked the waiter what was good and he said \"everything\". Usually not a good sign. Ordered the Singapore noodles and they were fine - just what you'd expect from a chinese restaurant. But at least it wasn't greasy.

Finally, as I'm getting ready to leave the server says \"Why didn't you try the ginger beef?\" He brought me a sample plate and it was really good - matchstick thin straws of beef tempura battered and sitting in a spicy-sweet gingery sauce. Definitely more like meat candy, but I'm feeling a hankering for it as I write this."}
{"text":"Service...polite and attentive. Very good.
Food....well done. Food quality. Okay; but was served with  luke warm and the sauces & were cold.
Food Variety. Not bad; but the meat dishes lacked meat and were mostly batter,
Dishes: They were out of sight..??
Hygiene of the place...very poor. Carpets were filthy. 
Windows were in desperate need of cleaning. 
Washrooms were filthy and nothing to wipe your hands on. Floors were greasy and grimy 
Price: Good. 
Quantity : Good. 
Conclusion. The place is in desperate need of additional staff and a cleaning service."}
{"text":"Service with a smile, fast and efficient. Great buffet, not the largest of selections though still a great variety of options. Very tasty, fresh, and quite enjoyable all in all.

And the buffet price was under $14. Seriously! Awesome deal."}
{"text":"Angelica N, Ron M and Joel K have already said all what I wanted to say.

Late night greasy eats. Delicious food but difficult to digest. You spend half your time eating, the other half singing, laughing at the zoo-like tom foolery and drumming chopsticks on the table. It was packed to the gills in the middle of the night, and everyone was having a blast. I couldn't imagine coming here at any other time. Friendly staff, but don't expect personalized service. Eat, laugh, don't give the poor staff a hard time and carry on your way."}
{"text":"Good late night drunk food.  I would say if you are coming any other time; I would choose another place."}
{"text":"Despite the interior bar look, amazingly fast service, very friendly - 10+ service, food was GREAT, tasty and fresh. A lot of BANG for your buck"}
{"text":"I had no idea that this place was a late night hangout... it explains alot. 
I went with 2 friends around dinner time and it was deader than dead.
As soon as I walked in I was hit with the smell of grease. It was as if the air was thicker in there.... I knew that when I left I too, would reek of grease. I did. 
The service was ok.  However the buffet at the back was not. The presentation was less than stellar and almost all the food was swimming in pools of grease.  I ended up eating about 12 bucks worth of veggie spring rolls.  They were greasy good, but definitely not healthy. 
I went once, i will not go again.  yuck."}
{"text":"Been coming to Singapores since 1996 . Fav place in calgary for consistent non greasy over battered food . Very surprised that there are some bad reviews I have nothing but great meals . Even when family from out of town come to visit they always want to come here . Of course I only hit the buffet that ends at 9 so not sure what happens at 2 am when the bars close . 
Cheers Singapores !"}
{"text":"My gf and I have been here numerous times before, so we decided to check it out again last night. 
-Was not disappointed! 
Egg foo Yung is so good! 

This is a very lovely family owned place. The people here know how to make you feel like royalty.

I forgot his name but, to the full sleeve guy--- You are amazing!! Thank you for always taking care of us! 
This will be our go to spot for late night eats"}
{"text":"We showed up at 10:30pm and let me tell you. That is EARLY!!! Only about 3 tables in the whole restaurant. I've been want to try this place for a while so we stopped in after the pub one night.

The server was very attentive- filling our waters as needed and the food came out fast (the were probably getting ready for the rush!) we order vegetable noodles, spicy chicken, calamari and ginger beef. The chicken has a spicy kick to it but had an assortment of vegetables too which I liked. The noodles was standard but tasty (skinny yellow noodles). I would pass on the ginger beef and calamari.. They truly were 75% batter, 25% meat... I guess that's what makes it so delicious :/

I've heard of you go late at night it turns into its own little bar! People dancing on tables and all!"}
{"text":"So fun at 3am GOOD FOOD TOO. There's usually a lineup at 3 so try and get here before then. Kind of expensive but the food comes fast!"}
{"text":"I've been to Singapore Sam's many, many times - at times arriving with drunken people (in my party or others' parties) after last call. Some of these inebriated people are the ones who mar the image of this business, making it a bad experience for others and for the staff.

I have never served tables or worked in the service industry but can imagine it to be specially difficult to perform when tending to 'drunks'.

Prices are high at night - I'm not sure about lunch time, never been there at that time.

Yes, this is fast food quality food but they've got the best GINGER BEEF in town!"}
{"text":"One goes to Singapore Sam's because one of their drunk friends thinks it's a brilliant idea and it's the only place open that late at night. After eating you immediately regret the decision and the person who choose it never lives down the choice."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Food is delicious, service is impeccable, open until 4am?! Talk about late night munchie heroes! I love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Not much nice to say about this place. Stopped off for a wee rest on a Saturday night a while back post-bar and pre-Warehouse. It was crowded with a ton of people who had flooded out of the nearby clubs. The atmosphere was okay, if crowded, but the seating arrangements left something to be desired. Me and my girls got chatted up by a group of dutch pilots (?!) which was sketchy (and if we hadn't been at almost the same table, they would have been easier to ignore), and the food was subpar. 

I've had my best meals when I'm tipsy and my senses are dulled, but even then I could tell that this was subpar AND expensive. Paid 13 dollars for chicken and cashews in yellow bean sauce, and got a bunch of celery in sauce with a little bit of chicken and three cashews. Everything was soggy with grease. 

First and LAST time!"}
{"text":"Alright so at the end of a night of celebrating and having a few bevies we decided to stop in here for a bite to eat. We heard that Singapore Sams can be quiet an entertaining experience.

It had an odd but interesting vibe. When we entered the place sorta resembled a karaoke bar. The tables had cheap colourful plastic cups and plates which gave it a child's birthday kinda feel? Anyhoo the point to the resto is that you are encouraged to make some noise with your chop sticks to the blasting pop tunes playing. Overall people seemed to be having fun and It was full of the rowdy after bar types. 

The food was mediocre at best. It did come quickly and they just tossed it on your table. Definitely over priced.

If your looking to extend the party after a night out and you just need to get some grease into your tum after boozing it... this quirky place is for you. If you are sober I would recommend looking elsewhere ."}
{"text":"There is an unfortunate amount of hate-on going for ol' Sam's, so I've decided to come to their (honest) rescue. First, let me give you some context:

1. This is not the place to come for authentic Chinese cuisine. Abort mission if that's your goal. Go somewhere with a name that you can barely understand.

2. This is not the place to come for personalized service and attention, especially not at 2am on a weekend. You will be treated like what you probably are - a starving drunk person just as likely to skip out on your bill as you are to vomit on their floor. 

Seriously - these folks put up with a lot. A LOT. Can you imagine taking care of hundreds of drunken morons every single night for the entire weekend? It'd be like babysitting 100 children with ADHD who are also carrying loaded pistols and have an undeniable urge to hump on your white tablecloths. So I chose to cut them some slack.

3. I liken this to being the Denny's of Chinese food. It is greasy, unhealthy and oh-so-delicious. You love it while your eating it. You tell yourself it's the greatest meal you've ever had in your life and you want to marry it.

But in 15 minutes it's going to sit like a stone in your stomach and you will question every ounce of your judgment. If you can survive this brief period of remorse, your overall experience will come out on the positive.

4. On a diet? Yeah, no. Not for you.

Yes, I too have been part of the raucous crowd that convenes here late at night after a night out in the Beltline. I have slithered their noodles down my throat and I have savored the juices of their finest ginger beef. I literally can't imagine coming here for a sit down meal at any other time.

I've also come here for the lunch buffet - as take out. The place isn't quite as fun when the disco ball isn't a-glowin'. Now if you're a student, a cheapskate or a person in need of large quantities of food (as much as you can physically force into a styrofoam container) - this place is a great option come lunchtime. Just make sure you bring CASH. They get a bit ornery if you try to pay with Debit/Credit.

Pro tip: Stuff as much as you can into your styrofoam container and just hold it shut, even if it won't close naturally. You might get dirty looks, but I've never been yelled at - yet. Mmmmm, 5 pounds of Calgary's finest imitation Asian cuisine. 

Is 4 stars probably pushing it? Yes. If I could I'd give them a 3.5. But as someone else mentioned, Calgary owes these fine folks a bit of thanks for giving us an option other than late night pizza or microwaved Alphaghetti."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in ages.  Nothing much has changed, actually nothing has changed except for the place being run-down.  I used to frequent it back in the early 2000's when the dining room was actually decent but the place is now falling apart.  Mismatched chairs, flaking off paint, broken tiles and a hallway that doubles as a storage room.  If you have limited mobility this place is a death trap and forget even being able to get to the washrooms.

I hear the place gets lively after the bars close and I guess that's all it's good for at this point.  I really hope the ownership takes the reigns here and restores this place back to a fraction of its former self."}
{"text":"For drunken fun after a night out.... 4/5
For actual food enjoyment... 1/5

Okay so apparently even in my drunken stupor I could not get over how bad that food was.... this is possibly THE worst Chinese food I've ever had! Now sure.. I was drunk.... but that is normally accompanied by increased enjoyment of crappy food! The only good thing was that there was actually a decent amount of meat on the chicken wings. I can't say anything else good about the food here. So I'll just stop.

Atmosphere on the other hand was awesome and tonnes of fun! A perfect place for dancing on chairs and drumming with your chopsticks.... think 80s and 90s dance music and classics with a party vibe and crappy food. By the way, the dancing and drumming is pretty much expected of you.

Despite the bad food, this place was hella fun and quite the experience! You should experience it at least once.... never been anywhere quite like it!"}
