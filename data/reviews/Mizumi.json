{"text":"Let me start off by saying this review is for people who don't particularly like Asian cuisine, but are forced to come here due to some type of obligation.   The place is decked out in bright red Asian decor, with a lit up waterfall flowing in the background.  I came here with a group celebrating an important occasion, and the guest of honor chose this place. I was a little skeptical after hearing the name, but there was plenty here for those who don't enjoy this type of food. Even though we were seated for teppanyaki style dining, I ordered the Angus Beef Sirloin and Black Truffle Teriyaki with fried rice. The black truffle and teriyaki sauce added a very good flavor to what was a pretty ordinary piece of meat. Also, I didn't think rice could be this good: adding eggs and seasoning to it, really made this side a nice surprise.     While I was a little shocked at first about the prices, the decor and the chef's performance at the table helped to ease my pain....The delicious food helped too."}
{"text":"Horrible service for you pay we spend new year eve Took over 1.5 hours to get our second course, need to improve costumer service it's a shame."}
{"text":"This restaurant have a great ambience and the food is excellent! I eat two nights and have a excellent price quality ratio. The black cod was superb, I remember the one that I ate at Alaska. The waiter is attentive. I recommend this place for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Service was great; food was a huge disappointment. Not sure what all the hype is about. Needs a serious revamp. Not up to the Wynn experience by any means. I'm quite sure Donald and Hillary will be skipping this spot!"}
{"text":"Dear Steve Wynn -  If I could say piss off to your face, I would.  We dined at SW steak on Thursday night, we were appropriately attired in the request \" no shorts policy\" - we were shocked as we walked in as there were quite a few shorts and strollers.  But we had a fantastic dinner at SW steak.  BUT AS WE WERE SEATED AT SW STEAK - they seated a whole table of professional basketball players in shorts and bubble jackets a table away from us.  THUS when we had our reservations at Mizumi we thought business shorts and polo shirt would be acceptable. HELL NO!  They refused to seat, accept at the bar (even though they had a stroller behind the bar) and a guy walking around in ripped jeans and a shirt that qualified him as homeless.  They sat at us the bar and then charged us for rolls we didn't eat and then we called for the managers and pointed out the stroller behind the bar and the homeless looking guy and the in discrepancies of the resort dress code and policy - he said he would have to look into it. We paid $150 in rolls we didn't eat at the bar.  Worst birthday weekend of my life.  Never going back to Wynn no matter how that manager handled it.  He could have quietly seated us -especially considering we spent over $700 at SW steak two tonight's before hand.  But this guy basically said Sorry..  We finished at delmonicos - who had no problem with my boyfriends dress.  Needless to say never,ever, ever go back to Mizumi.   Unless you are a professional sports player or celebrity - don't bother - they treat you like garbage!  Not going to say they are racist - but going to highly imply it!  BTW - Steve Wynn - you owe me $10.19 in an uncashed voucher that I refuse to redeem as I refuse to enter your horrid resort after my experience at Mizumi.  That is on top of the sushi rolls that I never ate but paid $140 for!!!!  Piss off Mizumi!  Hopefully you get better management!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many fine Japanese restaurants all over the United States.  Without question this is the most overpriced worst of all time.  We are at the hibachi portion of the restaurant.  The shrimp appetizer were the baby shrimp you find in a salad.  The cheapest of the cheap.  They mix them with greens.  After they're cooked they are so small you need a magnifying glass to find them. It was so unappetizing.  They then cooked the main course and because vegans were at the table they served them before cooking our steak.  They offer two steaks sirloin and tenderloin.  The waitress warned me the sirloin was tough to chew.  I ordered it medium rare.  It was impossible to chew as I had to spit it out. It was $70 for the poorest quality of meat ever.  My companion ordered steak and sea bass for $95.  The sea bass was not but rather some cheap fishy tasting clone.  The quality of this food rivaled Golden Coral.  The price at this sorry excuse for a restaurant is triple the highest price Japanese restaurant.   The waiter was not friendly and does not put on a show like other Japanese restaurants.  Even the salad was bad and without ginger dressing.  In all honesty McDonalds would have been a step above.   Avoid at all costs.  Just a tourist ripoff"}
{"text":"First, the negative. We showed up 20 minutes early for the reservation, and despite tables being open, we were made to wait. Fine. We had nice drinks at the bar. But 15 minutes after our reservation I had to prod the hostess to seat us. Only then did we get seated, and I saw other groups come in and get seated right away. My reason for knocking off a star.    The food was delicious. We sat in the main dining room and ate off the menu. The sushi rolls were fresh and flavorful. The Udon soup was very good and the Black Cod was the best I have ever had (sorry Zuma - you've been beat). The service was excellent. Kudos to our waiter. And the sommelier helped us choose an excellent bottle of Sake. The restaurant is beautiful and the waterfall outside sets a nice peaceful backdrop."}
{"text":"I have been to many Japanese restaurants, but as a Japanese  I think this restaurant serves the best Japanese food in this country so far.  We ordered nigiri, rolls, robata yaki and so on. Everything was great. Their chawanmushi was okay, but  I would give them a credit for just having this not-so-major-dish  on their menu.  They have their own tea collection which is $30 per pot.  Since I grew up with the real Japanese tea in Japan, I did not find their tea so special to be $30 but this is the only thing I can think of as something negative. Otherwise the food, service, view, and the decoration of the  restaurant was all phenomenal."}
{"text":"I thought this place was wonderful. The view is incredible and the sushi is cold, fresh and outstanding. We had the edamame, then the plate of all raw fishes (about 6 types) and one Philadelphia roll. We each had a cocktail and for desert we shared the spiced pear thing. I thought the fish was fresh and not \"fishy\" and I found the rice on the roll to be much better than most rice I've ever tasted. The desert was a little bland in my opinion, although it was pretty interesting and looked cool on the plate. You aren't going to get full in a place like this, but if you're wearing a tight dress and don't want to stuff yourself and want a romantic place to have dinner, this place is perfect. We would definitely eat here again. We found our waitress to be helpful and friendly and the food to be very good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat on the Strip. Take note: definitely a date place and pretty fancy. I highly recommend their special crispy Brussels Sprouts--to die for! I've had basic rolls here, including the California roll & spicy tuna roll, and they're good. Not the finest-tasting sushi, but I'm still game! I will say my sister does love her avocado-cucumber rolls here. Also, I just love the ambiance and the view of the waterfall. So beautiful!"}
{"text":"Not a family friendly place. Absolutely TERRIBLE TERRIBLE service ,a woman who claimed to be the manager was the rudest person i have ever met in my life, me and my family are shocked of her behavior and attitude. Her name is Sammy   First of all , i am fine with someone refusing service as long as they do it in a polite manner. However, she did the complete opposite , she insulted us and she bullied my 15 year old sister calling her ugly and thats not even half of it. She refused service because my 5 year old brother was not wearing \"pants\" even though he was wearing pants!! This lady is racist and rude.   After she basically kicked us out i went to the hotel manager to complain i told them this is not 5 star quality service , i would not accept this neither would anyone else , the manager was not there, however , the front desk manager was and other staff members who were shocked of her behavior and saw my little brother and called her and I quote \" ridiculous and crazy\" . I really want to see justice served   If i could rate this restaurant minus 2 stars i would , this is not acceptable Wynn. Shame"}
{"text":"We picked this restaurant for our \"fancy night out\" in Vegas and were not dissapointed.  We ordered the vegetable tempura to start and although the service was SLOW (30 minutes for an app!) they comped the food for us, so that was an added bonus!  One of the reasons we picked the restaurant is because it has an entire vegan menu, that is really hard to find on the strip!  I got the vegan chick'n roll and fall seasonal roll- both amazing and probably some of the best high-end vegan food I have had.  My boyfriend got the Mizumi roll which was A LOT of lobster! Even though the rolls are around $15-$20 each, you get 8 big pieces with each.  We also got a comped dessert of mochi ice cream which was really, really good too!  It is a beautiful restaurant, filled with beautiful people by a beautiful waterfall with beautiful food!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect when going here as we made a last second reservation.  We got seated against the glass overlooking the waterfall (absolutely perfect) and were helped right away.    We ordered a few skewers from their BBQ style food and while they were great, they are much smaller than you will expect.  I hear skewer, and I think summer Kabob.  This is like a long toothpick with a few bites on it.  The prices are very reasonable, so it's worth it as the meat is awesome, but just be prepared, haha.    As for sushi, we had their $45 surf and turf roll.  Honestly, the best sushi roll I've ever had in my life.  If it wasn't $45, I would have probably ordered 2 more instead of anything else.  Well worth giving it a try if you like Waygu and Lobster.    Overall - I will definitely be back, even if its just to share a roll and have a drink.  Cool place, excellent food."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently dined at Mizumi, while on a short stay at the Wynn, and I'd like to share the experience. The ambiance, while understandably over the top (this is Las Vegas after all), was duly charming, with a large waterfall serving as an impressive backdrop to the dining experience.   We started with an expensive Toro tartar, topped with a very small amount of osetra caviar and edible gold leaf (pretty!) which was well presented, and generally enjoyable, although at $45 I would not order it again. We then ordered an assortment of sushi, including yellowfin tuna, mackerel, albacore and so on, and that's where things went wrong. At best, the fish, while reasonably well cut, was a touch \"dry\" and certainly less than impressive.The flavors were somewhat subdued, and the preparation below what should be a relatively high standard, given the prices. In some cases, the use of Wasabi seemed excessive, hindering rather than enhancing. The rice itself was adequate, but nothing more.   The service, in all fairness, was courteous and professional. We were seated promptly and treated well throughout. Had the sushi risen above mere mediocrity, my review would have been far more positive, but it did not. Please note that it is only the sushi that shaped my opinion. Perhaps other dishes fair better."}
{"text":"After your review if it has any negativity in it,  you may get a communication from Guest Relations asking if they can contact you.  I responded with a yes and provided contact information.  I had more to share about the wait staff aggressively swooping in to grab the bill hoping to wisk two customers out the door who sat at the sushi bar but had to retrieve their own drinks at the separate liquor bar.  No call!  Typical.  Go see La Reve, The Dream at the Wynn but skip Muzumi."}
{"text":"Had reservation at 9.45. We had to rush out quickly to celebrate a friend's birthday. Tom from Mizumi at Wynn accommodated us with the fastest and the most incredible service possible. We are definitely coming back for a more relaxed dine in experience next time. And will definitely ask for Tom again!"}
{"text":"Went in expecting the sushi to be amazing, but was disappointed. The rolls are good but nothing you couldn't get at any decent sushi restaurant. They were not able to justify the $40 price tag for one roll. That said, the tuna sashimi was the best I have ever tasted and ruined sashimi at other restaurants for me! It is so fresh and juicy. The black truffle teriyaki chicken was also delicious, as the truffle added a really unique kick to the typical teriyaki sauce. The chicken was, however, overcooked. Overall decent food but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Must go place in Vegas for Fusion Japanese Restaurant.  The view is breath taking.  Just went there last night with wife and a friend.  Service is immaculate, very into detailed service.  Will go again.  Incredible place with stunning view and food."}
{"text":"All I can say about this restaurant is YUM!! From the food, to the service, to the scenery everything is perfect. I came here twice and wish I had one where I lived. The sushi is the best I've ever had. The salmon tempura and shrimp tempura are amazing. The sushi for 2 is also amazing because there is such a big assortment. If you are in the Las Vegas area deffinately go here. Ask for a window seat :)."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Overrated. Nice ambiance & service.  I don't mind paying the extra money for exceptional food, however the food was nothing special to justify the overpricing. I guess because it's Vegas they can get away with it...There is also a $125 minimum price per person to sit outside near the waterfall, which I think is absurd to charge a minimum for that."}
{"text":"This place definitely stole the show during our last visit to the Wynn.  Love the hotel and have stayed here quite a few times, but somehow always overlooked Mizumi.  So glad we finally went!  Beautiful restaurant.  The giant waterfall that dominates the view is perfectly Vegas.   Service was excellent -attentive and refined, not the least bit forced or stuffy.  Our server was a lot of fun (wish I remembered her name to give her props!)  Enjoyed the Omakase menu with an upgrade to include 'snow beef'.  What?  Well... It was quite the experience.  I'm not versed in the world of high end cow, but appearantly it was only released to limited restaurants.  We lucked out.   It was served thinly sliced,  almost sushi like.  They set a fire hot stone next to you and you cook the beef yourself.   3 sauces to dip in.  Amazing.  The meal was definitely $$$$, but it's Vegas so, c'mon, we knew going in.  Great night."}
{"text":"The most amazing set up you will ever see in your life , a 100foot waterfall just for us to enjoy while we eat wow wow , even if you don't like sushi go there just to have a drink you won't regret it"}
{"text":"I had dinner with my colleagues. We could see beautiful fall from table. There are individual space for 8-10 people. We ordered Sashimi and grilled fish, and yakitori. They were so tasty. Wagyu beef was not so good because it was too soft.But overall, the restaurant is worth visiting."}
{"text":"Third time here and it never disappoints. Great atmosphere, fresh fish, efficient service a great respite from the hustle of LV."}
{"text":"Overall delightful dining. Except for organic farmed salmon sushi ( which was removed from the bill, thankfully) each course was delectable. Spicy salmon tacos with orange bits & avocado were delectable-miso cod was perfectly paired w/tiny pickled veggies; coconut lemongrass tart w/roasted macadamia nuts & macadamia ice cream was just short of WOW!"}
{"text":"We had a great teppan dinner! Not too into the show side (seen all that) and price is of course reflective of location, but everything was so fresh and of course service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Wynn for the first time. Vegas restaurants are often overpriced and they are certainly often not justified by their meals.   I was quite impressed by this spot!!!  The drinks were all both creative and delicious. My friend really liked the Mizumi cloud! I enjoyed my Blushing Berry drink.  All of the meals were delicious: Duck confit bibimbap  A sashimi dish I cannot remember the fish Pork belly skewers Chicken skewers  Cucumber and seaweed salad The tiger roll And 2 amazing desserts   Mizumi was listed on Eater.com and it deserved its spot! More people should come here."}
{"text":"Im just not sure how you can do better!   Bravo!    Is it expensive?  Hell Yes.   Is it worth it?  Hell Yes.   Becomes quite the place to be around 7:30-8:00.    My Yelp :  All around best sushi place in vegas!   Don't miss it."}
{"text":"To those yelpers who have complained about pricing, go to Panda Express. To serious Japanese food lovers, this IS a 5 star experience. The room, the food and the service is very \"Wynn Worthy\""}
{"text":"5 stars for the interior and setting. STUNNING. I got a table by the waterfall and Japanese garden. So peaceful and gorgeous. WOW. Great experience.  My issue was that the sushi was actually VERY weak for the prices. I was saddened by this. So much potential!!! Now, this is a place where you shouldn't come for just sushi and nothing else, but that is what I did.  If you want a great dinner and you have $90+ to spend on food only, you will have an awesome experience here. If you spend $40-50 to get some sushi hand rolls and cut rolls to sample, you will leave hungry and unsatisfied like I did.  I feel sad giving it 3.5 stars accordingly. It is probably one of the ONLY 3.5 star reviews I have given on Yelp where I would highly recommend a friend try out."}
{"text":"I love Mizumi, some people find it a bit on the expensive side, but it is totally worth it.  ATMOSPHERE: The interior decor is lovely everything is in red and gold. We had a reservation and our table was right by the waterfall, which was mind blowing. The menu is very cute, it has a mask on it and when you open the menu it turns into a face ;-).  FOOD: For starters we had the Robata Platter (it's a small portion, but very delicious) and the Spicy King Crab with tacos. For the main course we had the Chilean Sea Bass, which I deeply recommended. My boyfriend had the Seafood Toban.  DESERT: I would recommend ordering the chocolate mask desert. It is fantastic, but very sweet.  DRINKS: Tried four different cocktails.  SERVICE: Our waitress was very nice and funny. Every time she was stopping by she was saying something funny and at the same time she was smart enough to give us the privacy for a nice romantic dinner."}

The black truffle teriyaki chicken was also delicious, as the truffle added a really unique kick to the typical teriyaki sauce. The chicken was, however, overcooked. Overall, decent food but not worth the price."}
{"text":"My wife and I had one of the very worst, overpriced sushi meals in recent memory.  Of the 4 specialty rolls we ordered, the first 2 were utterly tasteless, while the final 2 were inedible due to burnt soft shell crab.  When I expressed my displeasure to the waitress, management was generous enough to remove 1 of the 4 lousy dishes (please note the sarcasm...), at which point I apologized to the unfortunate waitress in advance for the $0 tip I would leave her, and informed management that their entire experience was a waste of time and money, that their meagre attempt to make things better by offering to remove 1 of the 4 inedible dishes an insult, and that make things right by recounting my experience on Yelp so that others would not make the same mistake I did by choosing to dine at Mizumi in the Wynn Hotel.  Take my advice and give this place a big pass...unless of course you like lousy, overpriced food that caters to the unsuspecting tourist clientele."}
{"text":"Great experience! Great food! Great company! Their tofu and sushi is out of this world."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on Saturday night and was incredibly disappointed.  I come to Vegas a few times a year and have eaten at many of the higher end restaurants with this being a place I wish never to return to.  I figured it would be a safe bet since we were attending Le Reve after dinner.  My sister and I sat on the Teppan side and I have had better and less expensive meals at smaller chains and even Benihana.  The view of the waterfalls were pretty, especially at night.  The service was ok, our server was friendly..  but the meal...  Ugh!  My sister chose the tofu and gardein meal while I chose the chicken.  The meal was so incredibly salty, it was almost inedible.  I think we each drank 3 glasses of water and didn't even finish or get close to finishing our meal.  The chicken was so overlooked, it was almost dry and difficult to eat unless you dipped in a sauce or drank a gulp of water after. I heard the tofu and gardein were cooked well, but again VERY salty.  I have had a variety of good and bad meals at Teppan restaurants and for $65, I expect that you are not going to mess up a chicken breast.  I can do that at home for about $7.  The vegetables were cooked well, but again, a bit on the salty side.  The only bright side to this meal was the dessert.  The little gelato with crumble was delicious.  The little lemon cheesecake was ok..  Nothing special. It took forever for someone to clear our plate and I am assuming this was because our plates were nearly full.  I remember the chef's name but I am not going to be mean and call him out because he was a nice guy who was a bit on the entertaining side.  I really wish I had decided to go to Carnevino instead... This place gave me the worst birthday meal... Ever.  For the price and location, I expected perfection or something close to it.  Incredible disappointment."}
{"text":"I was in town for a convention and happened upon Mizumi for dinner.  What a wonderful experience it was!  From the delicate flavor combinations to the synchronized service, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment.  Chef sent an amuse bouche of scallop tempura on an avocado puree with micro greens.  It made my mouth excited to see what else was to come! I ordered the hot pot which had sea bass, king crab, scallop, prawn and a shiitake mushroom.  It was just as beautiful in my mouth as it was presented.  I ended my meal with the honey toast which was a perfectly light ending to my experience.  The service was perfectly timed and I appreciated that each service member used my name.  It made it more personal experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely world class sushi. You won't find better sushi anywhere on Earth. The best in terms of quality and preparation.   However, be advised: If you don't like sushi, there's not a lot for you here!!   A specialty cocktail called the Blue Mizumi was really great.   Also: the music really doesn't fit the atmosphere at all. They need to be playing something sophisticated, to fit the high price tag and the elegant restaurant. The rock and roll really did detract from our meal, and it brought the experience down a full star.   Improve the music choices, and  then we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. Everything from the food to the service was A+.  We ordered the sushi platter and it came with an assortment of sushi and sashimi.  They have other entrees on the menu if you are not a sushi fan that looked delicious as well.  The restaurant is beautiful.  We came in March and all the windows were open overlooking the fountain.  If you are in the mood for Asian cuisine, this is your place."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Waited 2 hours for soup to come out with every course all out at once.  30 minute wait for something to drink.  Brownish old rotting avocado on the obviously pre made $30 roll that I could have gotten very fresh at my local sushi place plus another roll and soup and salad for $10 bucks with spot on service.  Got fresher avocado poolside at our hotel.  Rolls were mostly rice with minimal sushi.  Another guest next to us was smoking cigarette in restaurant and sleeping at table that we had to pay $250 minimum for.  I don't mind paying top dollar for a great meal, but this was not fine dining.   We had 4 servers, all confused.  Food didn't come out until I started booking another restaurant on Yelp.  Avoid this tourist trap.  Total waste of a night in Vegas."}
{"text":"We ate here on Saturday evening late, and found the service and decor and especially the food to be top notch.  While it's not the cheapest sushi in town, it was incredibly fresh and artfully presented at the table.  The sommelier I found to be competent and engaging with just enough edginess to be really effective--I was a fan.  Everything we ordered was of the utmost quality and the service matched.  The only thing I did notice, as some others here have mentioned, is that some folks were turned away for wearing shorts, while others were not.  I witnessed that personally--it may be because they were regulars, big spenders, who knows.  Point is, if you have that rule either you enforce it for everyone or you don't.    I will be back for another wonderful meal, once I save up enough to have another splurge while visiting Sin City!"}
{"text":"We did the Omakase menu. Food and service were amazing. We got a table facing the waterfall so it was very nice."}
{"text":"Dinner on 06.29.2015  I'm not sure what to say about this place other than...WOW...  For starters the atmosphere at the Wynn is already ripe with two things:  Money...and money lol.  It has a certain level of sophistication and class that you'd expect from the resort named after the man himself.  Anyway, on to the restaurant.  Had a 7:00pm reso but due to my own timing issues I couldn't get there until 7:15.  Called ahead and no problem, no issues when my friend and I checked in.  Now here is where it could have gone south if they were the type of restaurant that gets annoyed and huffy because I've seen it happen.  You show up late, get a worse table than they would have given you had you been on time etc. etc.  But not here.  We were seated literally one row back from the floor to ceiling window and it was amazing.  The waterfall was the perfect backdrop to the amazing meal and was a big topic of conversation throughout the dinner.  Our server, unfortunately I don't recall his name, was on point.  He wasn't hovering, but didn't annoy us.  He offered information when asked, but wasn't pushy.  He was right there when we needed him and left us alone when we looked like we were chatting.  At almost 2 hours for dinner he didn't seem to mind one bit and was cheerful and friendly throughout the entire meal.  The food.  OMG the food.  Here's a run down of what we had:  Sushi: Chu Toro Yellowtail Eel  Robatayaki: Jidori chicken Beef tenderloin  Meal: Miso Butterfish Hamachi Kama  I could write pages and pages about how great this is but I'll simplify it and say this:  I'm comparing this Japanese seafood meal I had to that of Alan Wongs, Sam Choi's, Roy's and the like.  Yes, I'm from Hawaii and have had the best of the best here when it comes to seafood and trust me, Mizumi fits right into that list.   All in all this dinner far exceeded any expectations I had and believe me, my expectations were definitely up there.  Great job Mizumi.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I had such a wonderful anniversary dinner.  It is pricey but the price is so worth it (what do you expect you're at the Wynn so you expect pricey but the best quality!!) Everything we ordered was 5 stars, not one dish was a disappointment.  We started off with the beef tataki and shiromi usuzukuri.  I loved that each piece had their fresh ingredients on each piece of meat and white fish. With my chopsticks I could easily pick up the beef, yama wasabi, frisee and garlic chips dipped in the ponzu, place in my mouth and loved how it just melted in my mouth.  The next course was the mushroom fava bean salad.  This salad turned my husband to a salad lover.  He said if all salads tasted this good he would eat it more often.  All he had to say was , \"wow\".  He would normally let me have the salad, but this case no! I was upset that I had to share this salad. The next course we enjoyed the king salmon sushi and pork belly. Both were small portions ( thank goodness) because we still more food coming.  Both were amazing! The belly melted in your mouth and the king crab makes a sushi roll tastes so much better! I can never go back to eating a California roll with imitation crab! The next dish we tried we were so surprised we liked.  Its called Mentaiko Spaghetti with a poached jidori egg. The sound of the dish didn't sound appetizing but we were told some come to this restaurant specifically for this dish and one person eats two of these in between courses- now I know why! All I know is after my first bite I said this is just amazing! I wanted to keep eating this dish and ask for more! Our entree dishes we ended with the miso black cod and catch of the day! I was so full but the food continued to be amazing!  From our view of the waterfall, great service, a meet and greet with the chef, made it a perfect anniversary! If you are looking for great culinary experience, let Chef Devin cook for you! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"\"The Best Tepanyaki Ever!!!\"  The chef was one of the best we've ever had the pleasure of watching him cook some of the best food. No matter what he prepared it turned out tasting as good as it smelled. Will definitely return. If you want to try something exotic try the Hibiscus Tea...wow is what describes this wonderful drink which actually includes a piece of Hibiscus.    Visited July 2013"}
{"text":"Terrible:( We decided to splurge one night during our Vegas adventure on food and that this would be the place.  We got seated fairly quickly but then it went downhill from there. Took 10 min to fill our waters by a water server, still no waitress. 20 min into waiting a waiter comes and says he's not ours but will start us out. We went ahead and ordered food and said we were not sure on what we wanted to drink. An hour after that still no sushi or a waiter so we asked the manager for help. He said he would check on it yet we watched him and he never did. About 20 min after that we got our sushi, it was not impressive. We had to ask for our check... So basically $150, 2 hours later we left very sad and still hungry. Definitely not how I was expecting to spend our money or our precious time on our vacation."}
{"text":"Exquisite foods. Their tempura were done perfectly. We were seated on a table with a beautiful view of the waterfall. Very attentive to the vegetarian needs."}
{"text":"We met our whole family in Las Vegas for Christmas.  My bride and I were there a day or so early and dined at Mizumi.  It was so good that when the rest of the family arrived on Saturday -- we we dined at Mizumi gain.  Yes, two nights in a row for us.  Cutting to the chase: it was excellent in every way.  There were six of us and we ordered something from every part of the large menu.  The sushi and sashimi were pronounced outstanding as well as the shrimp and veggie Tempura.  A surprise was the foie gras; I didn't expect such an wonderful dish in what is essentially a Japanese restaurant.  It was fantastic (but you know by now that I'm a sucker for foie gras!)  Our server, Tom, was great.    The restaurant is beautiful with a huge waterfall; just lovely.  Dinner for six was expensive but worth it!"}
{"text":"Crazy Awesome! The decor is unique, the view of the waterfall w koi pond is breathtaking. The sushi is so fresh. Try King Crab hand roll. Dinner can't miss with the Miso Black Cod! Very nice and helpful staff! Live it!!"}
{"text":"I thought I was going to be fully impressed with this place. The ambiance and service are 5 star all the way. Staff here is superb and attention to detail is there.   We tried about everything on the menu from the Robata side, nothing here was all that impressive. Tried some of the sushi, and living in Miami with better seafood in general I always find the seafood and sushi in Vegas to be pretty poor at best. This is a source or handling issue, and it continues at this establishment.   We also tried many of the hot plates, and most were better than the rest of the food. The brussels were out of control good, we actually ordered another one.   Prices are extremely high, but it was a business meeting and I was not paying, if I were I wouldn't come back here, the food just isn't where it needs to be. I'd select Nobu over it for something in Vegas of similar style."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had! The food is out of this world. This is not your old asian restaurant, but imagine Tokyo like quality plus the pizzazz of vegas! Uni chawamishi?!? Crazy good. Foie gras?!? Amazing. Incredible food and a mainstay at the Wynn"}
{"text":"My favorite 'Okada Roll' which is now the 'Mizumi Roll' w/ the restaurant name change, is the same wonderful, fresh Lobster Roll as before.  Even plated the same, w/ the empty lobster shell which all adds to the Mizumi experience.  I love when you order a Lobster sushi Roll that you taste lobster!  I highly recommend this and the Beef Tartare.    Only a part of the menu has changed thankfully!!  I would've been very disappointed if they took away any part of the Okada's picturesque appearance also.  I've been back many times since Okada became Mizumi, but not as a regular like before.  Mainly because my fav sake 'Princess' is no longer on the menu!  It paired so well w/ the fresh fish, which made Okada so unique, their sake list!  Also I like the Uni at a couple of other places better, such as Nobu.   The breathtaking waterfall, calm and serene indoor-outdoor feel, since the wall-window is completely pushed aside.  Japanese masks right behind the friendly bartenders as you walk in and the sushi bar, teppanyaki area all to the left.  Even the bathroom on the left is nice.  The puffy lights add to the airy Japanese decor.  Love it!!  The Teppanyaki area is absolutely on point and you can order from the regular menu if you are craving something special.  Yuko was my server, prompt, knowledgeable and offered items that made sense when I asked for something lite.  The Robatayaki section offers smaller bites, perfect for that last bite of something like a grilled butternut squash or meat skewers.    Excellent fresh yellowtail jalapeño and a sommelier for both sake and wine pairings.  The chef's take pride in their work as you can see when your order comes out and by my pix.  Hands down still one of my fav Wynn restaurants."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I walked in on a Sunday at 6:09 pm with the plan to catch the 7pm Le Reve show. I was out by 6:29 and somehow the service didn't feel rushed. I mentioned my plan, and the staff was very accommodating. I sat at the sushi bar and the service was great. Had the Tuna Tataki and the Spicy yellowtail appetizer. Would definitely recommend both but the Tuna stands out for me. The salmon I ordered was also buttery and amazing."}
{"text":"Wow....OMG The chef just threw away a whole teppaniki table full of food because one little sauce tray broke in the far corner of the grill. Knowing how many people would of still eaten that and watching it being thrown away. Just completely made me feel like a gluttonous American Pig..."}
{"text":"Poor service!!!!! food is very poor made . Note worthy to spend that money !!!! The only thing That I was impressed is from the interior design"}
{"text":"We celebrated my husbands birthday here, we had our table overlooking the waterfall, it is truly breathtaking, we were greeted by our server, she was very attentive. The food was very good, we ordered lobsters which were perfectly cooked, we then ordered the desert which was handmade in the shape of a mask, it was my favorite! We definitely had a memorable evening here"}
{"text":"Went here with a large group of girls. I'm not sure what they were called, but we were able to share cocktails in giant bowls- perfect to kick off a bachelorette.   Everything else was mediocre, especially relative to the price (which was high). The scenery isn't as fantastic as it's advertised to be, and the service was not what you'd expect from a high-end restaurant.  Food: 3.5 Ambience: 4 Service: 2"}
{"text":"Bad service and the food wasn't fresh. We ordered sushi platters and uni/amaebi/ikura. Feel sick afterward. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I only ate here once for dinner. Overall was pretty underwhelmed. I did not love any of the sushi we ordered. The tuna and taro tacos were delicious. The tofu and beet salad was pretty flavorless. Sea bass was very good. I thought it was a little hit or miss -- but some of the people we were with went the next evening and reported that they really enjoyed it...."}
{"text":"Spicy tuna arare roll!! All day everyday! This is a great spot to come with friends and you can get a table at the tepeniaki tables which they cook in front of you."}
{"text":"Sushi perfected with stunning ambiance and inventive Japanese cuisine. Signature Wynn hospitality made for a terrific dining experience starting with an assortment of hand rolls and sashimi, fresher than fresh ending with a seafood hotpot. Dessert was delicious."}
{"text":"Mizumi was fantastic!  My wife and I had reservations somewhere else, but after watching La Reve, we didnt really want to leave the Wynn. Instead, we dropped by Mizumi and had an amazing time. The front desk was so accomodating, perhaps because it was a Monday. They seated us in the 2nd table in from the waterfall and the view was still AWESOME! The entire night, both of us were completely mesmerized.   Drinks: The Mizumi Cloud was absolutely awesome! It has actually inspired us to play around with lemongrass in our cocktails. This was really the best find of the night.   Food: As for the actual food, we ordered a handful of things.   Pork Belly - I was expecting something a bit more, but was a little underwhelmed with this dish.  Scallop Tataki and Crispy Shrimp roll - This was awesome! The scallops were very delicate and the jalapeno added some very nice heat, which I love.     Baked Sweet Miso-Marinated Black Cod* - was also really tasty.   They also gave us a free platter of the ice cream mochi because we had just gotten married. Some were hit  or miss, but overall, a pretty interesting dessert.   Thinking back, the service was a bit slow, but between the view, the food, and the company - I was having a great time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Me and my best friend come here regularly we can't get enough of the hand king crab roll ( I think that's the name lol). The blue mizumi drink is my absolute favorite you have to try it! Sean is always our waiter coincidently but he's great too! Excellent service, beautiful view, and great atmosphere. Everyone is so friendly."}
{"text":"Went to the newly renovated Mizumi which used to be Okada and ate at the tepanyaki side of the restaurant. I loved the new decor and design. There was only one option for vegans but it was very delicious. The service was great but they weren't conscience enough when cooking our vegan meals because we do not consume dairy. The pricing was very high but overall the experience was good. Oh and it gets very warm when your chef if cooking in front of you. I started to sweat and it was uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Ate here for my fiancé and I's 7th anniversary celebration. It was a quiet December evening, yet the service was top notch! The sushi was also very well cut and hit the spot!  They even provided specialty dessert for our celebration! We very much appreciated the extra treatment!  Would definitely recommend as a must visit sushi restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We were excited to return to Mizumi after a great experience in December, but this visit just wasn't awesome. Probably 3 stars, so I'm dropping them to a 4. The staff were on point with preparation around food allergies, quickly removing the ginger and wasabi handled by a chef that prepared shellfish - but it took quite a while for them to replace it after our sushi was served, so we had to wait to eat. The wait staff were generally not very present around the sushi bar, and compared with the excellent service we had in the dining room on a previous visit, it left a lot to be desired. The nigiri was cut well and the albacore was especially delicious. We ordered the tuna arare roll, our fave from the prior visit, and it wasn't at the same level. I'd be willing to give them another chance, but with the price level, it isn't likely to come soon."}
{"text":"Amazingly tasty Japanese food with wonderful presentation. There's a pretty artificial waterfall garden behind glass for the view. The portions are Japanese-sized so you will end up spending quite a bit of money if you eat more than that. The service was very good, and they did their best to serve a large amount of food to our party within a relatively short amount of time so we could make our show appointment. I highly recommend the sushi platter and the chocolate mask dessert."}
{"text":"Gorgeous setting!!! Very dramatic views with the waterfall in the main dining room.   The sushi was very fresh. Bone marrow was fatty and flavorful.   The truffle teriyaki chicken was well-cooked, retained its moisture and was not dry at all.   I thought the food was very good, but there was nothing too creative that I had not seen before, so I docked one star."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than five stars.  I have never had sushi so fresh and well made.  The sushi platter was well prepared and tasty.  Their oysters appetizer was incredible!  I definitely will be coming back for seconds and thirds."}
{"text":"amazing!!!! The best sushi in Vegas!! Nobu in hardrock used to be my fav, but I def have to say Mizumi is now my favorite. My boyfriend and I were just passing by and decided to try it, we had such an amazing experience from the food to the service to the amazing creme brule!! A must go when in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Mizumi and this time we had a nice table by the waterfall. We had a late dinner reservation but we were assured we would not be rushed through our tasting menu and they did not disappoint. Each course was accompanied by a sake pairing or wine in some cases.   the sashimi here is amazing. as is the kobe beef. We had oh toro topped with gold caviar and kobe beef from the only place certified to sell it on the strip, or so they claim anyways..   the service and the food are top notch here. if youre a sashimi lover, you must go here."}
{"text":"Awesome decor and design concept. Awesome japanese food ... All kinds. Expensive."}
{"text":"While staying in the Wynn Towers, I had a quick dinner at the sushi bar.     Service:  4 stars    Freshness: 5 stars    Flavors:  5 stars    Presentation:  5 stars   I enjoyed fresh scallop and uni sashimi prepared by one of the attentive sushi chefs.  From the menu, I selected:  pork belly, edamame, and the yellowtail jalapeño sashimi.   All were beautifully plated, and quite tasty.    A very extensive sake list - I opted for one of the cold unfiltered selections.   Yes, it is somewhat pricy....but, the value was reasonable.    Worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Love this place! We've eaten here three times now and we've always enjoyed ourselves. We've always received good service and recommendations. This place is definitely on the higher price side but the experience and food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Mizumi is amazing. Weather permitting, one full wall is opened up to a water fall, which is great ambiance.   The Tzatziki roll is absolutely to die for. The jalapeño on top with the crispy shrimp is such a winning combo. The Brussel sprouts were also extremely delicious and unique, I'd recommend getting them to share. The cucumber sake martinis are delicious.   We got the chocolate Mizumi mask for dessert. Very beautiful, and also tasty!"}
{"text":"Actually I had fairly low expectations when I ordered the Omakase.  It's $125 a person and $60 for wine and sake pairing.   But it was actually okay for casino prices.  Casino average charges twice or three times above local restaurants.   That being said, I think it's a good dinner.    Wasn't impressive or exceptional.  But it's not bad for the price considered it's inside Wynn and there view is stunning.  The water fall simple makes everything better."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! We made last minute reservations, and we ordered the 6 course tasting with wine and sake pairing. The food was out of this world delicious and the drinks with the food were foodgasmic. Must try if you're staying at Wynn or encore !"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant tucked away behind the club intrigue. I liked the set up more then Andreas but that's simply for the stunning waterfall they have in the background.  We came here for a few drinks and a light dish. They had a special mule they were serving which is what I ordered. For a Saturday night, it wasn't that busy at all. Pretty strange considering there was a giant line of people out front waiting to get into the club. I also had the black pepper trustled edema. They brought this out quick and in turn I devoured it quickly. Very good. Buddy had some sushi which I don't eat.  Very nice setting. If you're in town with your significant other, take him/ her here. Excellent vibe and setting."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best meal I've had. Yes it's expensive but worth it. We tried their 6 course tasting menu and it did not disappoint. The most memorable course was the Wagyu Beef. It was so flavorful and delicious and it just melts in your mouth! The service was also excellent. The server took his time explaining each course to us."}
{"text":"I have to say, my experience here was well looked after.  I called earlier in the day to reserve a table near the window for a view of the waterfall.  When I arrived I was sat at a table across from the window seats, after I asked to be moved next to the table, they quickly accommodated me.. The service was great, the sommelier was also informative of correcting my mistake ordering a half bottle of wine instead of a full.  I was also able to order a moderately priced ($200-vegas moderate lol) bottle of red wine and enjoyed it.  Moving onto the food. I started with yellowtail sashimi with jalepeno jelly.. This was the best version I have had of this \"common\" sashimi dish. There was so much more to it than other places, especially Nobu. I say this place should make everyone eat this first! Next I ha to enjoy the king crab from the robanyataki. This was a very light, tasty, dish, definitely not filling but extremely satisfying dish. The sommelier had recommend this dish earlier, so we knew it was going to be divine! We also paired the robanyataki mushrooms  during this course as well.  The next course I chose the hot pot soup with a white fish, scallop, prawn and crab. It was very light, not much flavor from other sources besides the seafood and lightly salted. Again, it was small and pricey, but well worth it! Lastly, I had the 1.5lb king crab with ponzu butter sauce.  Out of this world!  The robanyataki infused charcoal flavor paired with the citrus butter was to die for.  It Created such a new and interesting flavor profile I can't even describe it in words, just something I can highly recommend.  Overall, this was a thrilling experience in a Japanese restaurant. I had a much better experience here than over at Nobu in Caesers Palace, and also paid the same amount $400 plus tip for two. Definitly a must try for an open budget, daring date!!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and service is great.  Would suggest avoid making reservation for the weekend or peak dinner hours, most likely wait a while for food and drinks.  It is a bit pricey but food is amazing! Would suggest anything off the sushi menu (never had any roll here tho),  kurobuta pork robotayaki, miso cod and the teppanyaki of sea bass and Waygu is heaven!!"}
{"text":"We came to Mitzumi to celebrate my wife's birthday. It was a very special occasion and we thought we would try a very special restaurant. On entering, the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit right by the waterfall. We would have to wait about 5 minutes. We felt it would be worth it. Sure enough in under 5 minutes they had our table ready. It was an unobstructed view abutting the floor to ceiling glass window. Within 1 to 2 minutes of being seated, the waiter came by for our drink order. We each had a cocktail. We started with the meal with an arare roll. Each piece of this cut roll was melt in your mouth delicious. Undoubtedly the best cut roll I have ever had. Next we had the SA plate. This consisted of about 10 pieces of very fresh raw fish, mostly tuna and salmon. Again very fresh and succulent. We finished by getting another cut roll,  the tataki roll. This was very different than anything I have had before. But in a very good way. We were far too full to even look at the dessert menu. I will return to this restaurant when I have another big event to celebrate (too expensive for routine dining for my budget). The price is steep but certainly worth it. The service is as good as the food. Kudos to Anthony, the waiter, and Paul busboy."}
{"text":"The food here and the service is spectacular! One of my favorite restaurants by far! The menu is VERY pricey. The restaurant is gorgeous, there is a huge water fall that cane viewed anywhere in the restaurant. The service was fast and the waiter was very knowledgeable.   We ordered the yellow tail sashimi appetizer. which is the BEST sashimi I ever had. I highly recommend it! The brussel sprouts are to die for! Very tasty! We also had the snow kobe and that is the best steak i ever had in my entire life! It was so tasty, juicy and melted like butter once you tasted it. The wine was fantastic, they had a wide variety of wine selections.   If we ever go back to vegas i would love to visit this restaurant. But it was definitely pricey!  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"??????????????? ???Japanese??????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????????????OK???  ????????????????????????????????  ????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????? ?????????? ???????"}
{"text":"Yellowtail with jalapeño gelee is good. The ponzu sauce brought out the sweetness of the fish. The texture is good too. The crunchiness of crispy onions contrasted very well with the tenderness of the fish. The lobster miso soup is OK. Felt like lobster in miso soup. No wow factor. The sushi is OK, not as good as Nobu. The rice is not moist enough and felt a little cold so the temperature is kind of off. But the fish is very fresh and good quality. Unit sushi is good but not as good as nobu. Nobus uni sushi's seaweed is more crispy and more flavorful. Miso black cod is flavorful. Even though it didn't have the crispy fish skin like nobu, it has crispy potato chips. The chocolate mask dessert is very visually appealing and interesting. Flavor wise is OK. The decor is nice and the view is great! The atmosphere is vibrant and the service is very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"It was okay, the scenery and atmosphere are nice. Super expensive $80 per person not including the expensive drinks. I was not disappointed with any of our food but I was not welmed either. I did like the strong drinks that made you forget you where getting screwed (price wise)."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out but was disappointed. Quality of the fish here is mediocre. This place is overpriced and overhyped as a high quality sushi restaurant. I found better sushi at other restaurants on the strip that was much more reasonable. Our waiter messed up our order and was unapologetic. He quickly snatched away a roll they served us but we did not order after we informed the serving person we did not order that roll. It was rather un-classy seeing how quickly he took the mistaken roll from us as if we wanted to keep it. Class act - absolutely not."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior.  They have updated with lush reds, a departure from when it was Okada.  Pretty place, but I would look elsewhere for good sushi.    The chutoro was NOT good.  Lots of connective tissue.  Salmon sashimi, good.    GOOD: -beef tartare tacos, love all the condiments and the taro shell, this replaced the tuna version on the menu before -mango sorbet coconut mousse, light and refreshing -toro tartare, I like chunky pieces, similar to morimoto's style, but not the same caliber  OK: -lightly dressed mixed greens salad -miso cod, as expected  EH: -Mizumi roll, lobster was rubbery, $40 for poor execution is NOT ok  Great bottles of junmai daiginjo.  We got the luxurious sake flight also for $60, next time I would just go for the bottle.    $500 exclusive of tip.  Food = 2.5*s, Service = 5*s, Ambiance = 5*s"}
{"text":"Loved!!!  We frequent Vegas...well...we frequent the Encore/Wynn and typically eat at Wazuzu for our sushi cravings.  We decided to eat at Mizumi one night as it was new since our last visit.   We sat at the front Sushi bar so we could take in the whole restaurant.  It's gorgeous with the waterfall, the lighting, and decor.  The staff could not be nicer or more attentive.  The sushi was delicious.  Also, we were in a hurry as we had overslept and we were in and out in less than an hour without even having to rush...super efficient.  I would definitely recommend Mizumi and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We went in knowing we shouldn't be expecting authentic japanese food.  However I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt based on Wynn standards.  Service was on par, very formal, generous qty of staff - we must've had 7-8 unique faces serving our small table throughout the night.    Writing this on an iPhone so I'll keep it in outline format.   Atmosphere - top notch, sat with the waterfall view.  Decor is mostly reds and golds with splashes of art in various colors.    Food - omakase had a wide variety of selections.  I would say it was more of a tasting menu than an omakase.  Nothing blew my mind in terms of freshness or complexity of flavors through simplicity as one would expect from a high end japanese restaurant.  Was good food for sure, but I expected more.    Service - front end greeting staff were Asians, not sure if this was for appearances of an Asian restaurant or if it was coincidence.  Waiter and sommelier were white.  Very pleasant people but didn't understand Japanese food fundamentally, only what they've been told to say.  Nevertheless, pleasant staff.    After odor - restaurant was well ventilated, and we left smelling the same way we arrived despite our neighbors' small little meat grill.    Conclusion - can't exactly recommend this establishment for its food given the missing value, however nice place if you want superior atmosphere and service with a \"themed\" meal of Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Maybe the best meal that our group has had in our lives.  I had the steak because I am not a fan of sushi but my buddies ordered off of the chef's menu and they loved it so much.  I hate Sake but found myself enjoying theirs.  The food is pricey but it was definitely worth it.  It was great meal to end a Vegas trip on..."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Vegas, I have been many times and will continue to come back. Crunchy scallop roll is the best! Had quite a few orders of that. The lobster was absolutely creamy delicious and melted in your mouth. Also the hot stone wagyu is a MUST. Like butter. You cook it yourself which Is excellent with a group because everyone can cook as preferred. Also had the Kobe beef and Robituri platter I believe it's called. You also cannot leave without the Mizumi face dessert. Yum! I get it everytime no matter how full I am. The reason I took a star away is because this time it took a long time for our server to come out, take our orders, food to get there etc (we were sitting outside at the table by the waterfall which could be why but at $625 pp I would expect prompt service) also our table wasn't bussed ONCE other than when new food arrived but never any glasses which was actually worse than the slow service as we had the lovely view. But I was with a large group drinking lots of alcohol so we had TONS of empty glasses on the table during the whole meal. Other than that everything else is excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a gorgeous place in the Encore hotel, and it does the Japanese fusion thing with absolutely the best fish, and that makes all the difference.  You'll drop some coin here, but it will be worth it.  This passes Nobu as my favorite in Vegas for sushi."}
{"text":"Definitely a good restaurant. The atmosphere is a bit simple when compared to the pictures. The 'wow factor' falls short. Maybe better in the summer when the doors to the waterfall are open. Service seemed nervous. Food was very good but a bit overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I've yet to eat somewhere, fill up and continue to think of ways to hoard more food out to have even more! That's exactly what we did after our delicious Teppanyaki meal here at Mizumi!  Our chef was pretty chill and I'm so glad he didn't toss food into our mouth from the grill like we're some kind of culinary seal waiting for our meal! He prepared our food in an entertaining, yet dignified manner and man, was it FANTASTIC!! He started us with the noodles, which in hindsight, I wish had been the last item to eat, as it was one of our faves! We also had grilled veggies, shrimp, scallops and fried rice.  If you go, skip the fried rice and double up on those noodles! You will be like \"ya know, that chick TC on Yelp was right, this is fucking amazing!!\" and I'll be nodding my head in agreement all slowly and smiling like..'right? I told you!!'  Somehow we saved room for dessert.. they hooked us up with some mochi since it was our honeymoon celebration! Then we ordered the green tea macaroon and a chocolate ice cream dessert that had a chocolate painted face on it! So beautiful and SO danged delicious!  Everything was PERFECT at Mizumi.. I sometimes sit and think about those noodles. I just know we need to come back for more.. and best believe we shall!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but I have to disagree with all the reviews on here. Upon walking in the restaurant my first observation was their decor. It was corny and stereotypical. It was like they were trying to make every square inch of the place as Asian & Japanese as possible... just in case you forgot you were at a place called MIZUMI.  We were a large group of 11 people and ordered almost every sushi and roll dish on the menu, including the mizumi special roll.  Nothing was memorable.. Just mediocre.  I've eaten at nobu and morimoto which were exceptionally better. Even the dessert chocolate cake was dry and unappetizing.  The service was another disappointment. I normally don't like to comment on service for restaurants because I've always held food taste to be of highest importance. But, when the poor service means I don't get my food, we got problems. Getting a waiter to help was worse than hailing a NYC taxi cab on a rainy Friday night.  We were looking around for a server and they deliberately avoided eye contact and ran the other direction. It happened multiple times.   When we didn't receive our sake order 30 minutes in to our dinner we asked to speak to the manager. The woman was completely indifferent about our comments of the lack of service. We left with a $1600 bill and completely unsatisfied.   We frequent Vegas often and enjoy eating well. This is one of the few LV restaurants neither I or my 10 friends will ever revisit."}
{"text":"Very good place but very pricey we got the lobster roll and it was very good and had a lot of flavor the filet steak was good service was a bit slow but friendly eddy was our server and he was a nice guy place was busy but it's Friday night at Vegas probably won't be back because of how expensive this place is but I recommend it if you have the money"}
{"text":"This is easily a five star review. I was so impressed. I love sushi so I'm always trying the best sushi in each location I go to. Every time I think I've tried the best sushi I've ever had, I got trumped. This was the best trump of all. This restaurant blew my mind. I am a huge fan of Las Vegas dining, as you can clearly tell by all of my reviews and posts. But this time, I was in for a big, pleasant surprise. I dined here with my fiancé and his family. We had every course. Appetizers, cocktails, sushi, followed by dessert and espresso. Of course a fancy dinner like that is going to come at a cost. So save your pennies for this rainy day. It is delicious. I don't have any specific items that you need to order, because everything blew my mind. What I do recommend if you're in a larger party, order a bunch of stuff on the table to share so that you can try the most because there is so much good food there. I see posts all the time that celebrities are there and I definitely understand why now. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself."}
{"text":"It was Vegas and we wanted to try somthing different. Food was good, not great. The view was better than the food TBH. I feel like any sushi restaurant in any of the hotels would ahve been just as good"}
{"text":"Overpriced sushi and extremely small portions. Not worth paying all that money for mediocre sushi you can get at any other sushi place.. The only thing I liked about this place was the waterfall scenery and the decor."}
{"text":"Came here for our 10 year anniversary.  We made a reservation on open table for the Teppanyaki area and the food was outstanding.  Started off with a couple of cocktails that were pretty good then moved to our table.  I ordered a spicy blue crab roll which was only mediocre but still good.  They brought a little fried scallop which was really tasty then a small salad that was also good.  My wife loved the Asian salad dressing.  For dinner I had the tenderloin and it was juicy, flavorful and outstanding.  The teppanyaki chef Joe was very friendly and made the meal extra enjoyable.  The fried rice was pretty good too.  Desert was some passion fruit cake thing that I devoured and for our anniversary they brought out some mochi ice cream.  I ate the green tea ones and the Mrs. ate the strawberry ones (which I assume were better than the green tea).  Overall it was a very nice meal and we will be back at some point."}
{"text":"This place used to be much better. We started at the sushi bar, fish was not as fresh as it used to be. I have been to Mitzumi many times in the past. Some of the fish was so bad that they removed from the tab.  Moved on to the Tapan area. The chef was very nice as well as the service. But, the sea bass and sirloin steak came short again. Not a lot of flavor.  Not sure if I go there again."}
{"text":"Well, it's pretty but don't go there if you are hungry:). The food is just ok,  no better then any other place. I actually would prefer Kabuki, even if the cost was the same.  Next time I go to Kabuki. Why do people go there to eat again?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner, it has one of the best dinners I've ever had, ambiance was wonderful and service was excellent. If you're looking for the ultimate Vegas experience or to celebrate something special, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. The sushi and sashimi are top notch. The platters are excellent, the yellowtail jalapeno sashimi is great, don't miss the miso black cod or the spicy garlic edamame. Service is good, great sake list and desserts as well. Also try the Brussels sprouts"}
{"text":"We got in without a reservation as we were waiting for Le Reve to start. The setting is quite beautiful overlooking some fountains and lush garden. The service is exceptional! I had the Octopus Salad and my daughter had the Jidori Chicken and Black Truffle Teriyaki. For $35 a plate, the food was good but not amazing. To their defense, pricing is comparable anywhere on the strip. I had better Japanese food in SF!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a special occasion. The service was perfect. I went with my uncle and he can be a little demanding. He asked to be re-seated again and re-arrange the table for the best view. We also saw Steve Wynn he was eating privately with his group on a special dinning area by the water fall. Felt bad for his body guards had to sit away and watch no eating just made sure he was protected. The sushi was excellent. The decor is stunning when you walk in on the right side has a bunch of face masks"}
{"text":"Lead by Executive Chef Devin Hashimoto  Beautiful views/ scenery of the  private gardens, koi pond and waterfall located inside of Mizumi. We had a beautiful view of the waterfall.   Total excluding tax & tip came out to roughly $321 for 2 adults. I've mentioned this before, call us crazy but when in Vegas we always have a \"Second Dinner\" so we skipped drinks etc. for this meal so we can have it at the next restaurant.   Ordered a sashimi platter for our appetizer $55...it was simple & delicious.   We had the Chef's Omakase (like a prix fixe menu/ chef's choice) Which was $125 per person.  First Course Ama Ebi, Caviar, & Garlic Crisp Chip  Second course Seared Scallop w. Yuzu topped with thin slices of nori, Duck Confit Taco, & Takoyaki filled with Lobster  Third Course Mentaiko pasta topped with a perfectly poached egg & nori strips (Absolutely divine!)  Fourth Course  Braised Short Ribs, seasonal vegetables, & fresh Wasabi mousse   Fifth Course Chefs selection of Nigiri (Consisted of: Fatty Toro, Uni, Giant Clam, etc.)   Sixth Course  Dessert - A coconut mousse with mango/passion fruit sorbet. Mochi Ice Cream tasted extremely fresh. The mochi wrapped around the ice cream was just perfect.   We had to squeeze in an order of Ama Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) nigiri for the both of us $16 -- mmm you can never go wrong!  Overall, We thought the food was delicious and beautifully served, the server was great and very accommodating, and the atmosphere was fun and intimate. I am anticipating that we'll return in the future.    *I just wanted to add that we went for dinner without any reservations and the friendly host seated us immediately, but they were indeed packed, (didn't see any tables available), so it's probably safer to make reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in The Wynn Hotel and Casino, right above the Tryst nightclub, when you enter near the hotel registration area.  The food here at Mizumi is good, not necessarily \"great\" when looking at it per portions, taste, uniqueness and ultimately price.  Las Vegas is known for having some high end, fancy Asian restaurants be it Chinese or Japanese including Nobu, Tao, Red 8, Wazuzu, and Mizumi, where it can cost roughly on avg $100 per person and you're not even filled (not even that lame stereotyped myth of \"30 minutes later you're hungry again\" for Chinese food).  You'll be satisfied, but not stuffed and maybe craving a bit more.  That may be good or bad, in that the girls usually want to eat less, more healthy and stay thin.  The guys sometimes want to get their feed bag on and money's worth, but in truth some may need to watch their weight and reduce their Buddha belly's anyway.  You can't go too wrong with most dishes. Here's some of what we had:  Robata Platter @ $28 with sea bass, organic Jidori Chicken, beef, shishito peppers, and shiitake mushrooms.  Seared Albacore Sashimi @ $22 with crispy onions and ponzu sauce  Baked Sweet Miso-Marinated Black Cod @ $38 with cherry blossom pickled baby vegetables, and Okinawan sweet potato chip  Scallop Tataki and Crispy Shrimp Roll @ $30 with seared Hokkaido scallops, crunchy shrimp, avocado, onion sprouts, jalapeño, yuzu tobiko, citrus aïoli, and eel sauce.  None were awe inspiring, but also they weren't bad either, I've had the same dishes done better elsewhere (as well as worst elsewhere), so it's just average to me, not bad, and it's good, but not anything that stands out or is unique.  I'd say this 'tho as my RECOMMENDATION...  Crispy Brussels Sprouts or Broccoli @ $12 with toasted almonds, green onion, balsamic soy reduction.  This is a fantastic * * * * * (five stars!) dish, we had the Brussel Sprouts and the portions were a good size to share and the flavor was amazing (and I generally don't like brussel sprouts), so I'd probably try both the Brussell Sprouts AND the Broccoli if/when I come back here as part of the staple items to order with a group.  If you crave Japanese food and are in Las Vegas and don't want to leave the Encore / Wynn or area with Palazzo / Venetian, this does the job for convenience and proximity, 'tho price of course is no bargain since this is high end cuisine.  If you're wanting \"the best\" and was in Las Vegas for one night and one night only, then I'd read all of the reviews, research the peer restaurants and make an educated decision based on the evidence you read for what you like and are looking for.   If you're looking for a \"bang for your buck\" and to get filled 'cuz you're starving, then you can still eat here, but may need to eat something a bit before or follow up with snacks after to keep your costs down... but if money is no object, if you order it and are willing to pay for it... bon appetite!  You'll find a limitless menu of sushi delights to order from.  If this were an AYCE buffet, it would be awesome... but that's just unreasonable wishful thinking :) for such a place like this that caters to the lifestyle of the rich and famous types...   The view here is nice, you get an aesthetic waterfall, and they have open air seating as well as indoor seating.   The service here is good, and friendly."}
{"text":"Overall unimpressed.  The sushi rolls were not flavorful.  Ordered the Mizumi Roll for $40. Portion was the size of an average roll. It had maine lobster, avocado, tamago, soy paper, wasabi tobiko, and yuzu mustard aïoli. It was a very lightly sauced roll and I appreciated the generous amount of lobster. I guess that's where the $40 came in.  The Dragon Roll was alright, tasted like a roll from a typical sushi joint, if not worse. Not recommended.   The Yellowtail Sashimi and Jalapeño Gelée with jalapeño gelée, soy salt, ginger, negi, cilantro oil, crispy onion, ponzu sauce was flavorful. The quality of the yellowtail was enjoyable as well. Great combination of ingredients and flavors.   Black truffle teriyaki chicken was decent. Not much truffle flavor, but that stuff is precious.   Sashimi was fresh, tuna was scrumptious. Generous slices.   Even for an expensive night out, I would opt for another restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious Sushi/Japanese/Teppanyaki restaurant located in the Wynn. Easy access to the restaurant by the valet parking in front of the hotel. Right outside of the nightclub. There are several options for seating - the separate Teppanyaki room, the main dining room, outside by the small pond, a small sushi bar.   As with everything at the Wynn this restaurant is well-appointed. I was worried before coming here that it might be too fancy for my kids, especially after reading reviews of people who could not wear shorts in the restaurant. It's fine dining and I would just wear pants/jeans/dresses, etc. to be safe and no shorts or casual wear. There is no formally stated dress code.  We sat in the teppanyaki room because with kids that's just so entertaining :). The nice thing is if everyone in your party doesn't want teppanyaki they can order off the normal menu. Also, if you want a certain sushi that isn't on the menu ask because they likely can make it. We didn't see salmon rolls or nigi toro rolls and we were able to order both...and they were delish!  For teppanyaki we tried shrimp, sirloin steak, and sea bass. All was wonderful. The fried rice is da bomb. The soup and salad are fresh and filling. The veggies are cooked and season to perfection.  For dessert, it's included in the price of teppanyaki. We each had a sorbet and we were also served the special chocolate mousse with a Geisha face. So good! So filling.  I would love to eat her every time I come back to Vegas. It's definitely at the top of my list of dining spots. And you can definitely take your kids here. There's just no kids menu so be prepared to pay for that :)."}
{"text":"Catching up on a dining experience here about 10 days ago. Vegas has so many restaurants and since we were staying at the Wynn Encore, we had dinner at Mizumi. Let me say that the wagyu beef cooked on a hot stone was fabulous. Very pricey but it seemed worth it. We had assorted sushi - all good and the service was well paced."}
{"text":"I don't need to tell anyone reading this that this place as AMAZING SUSHI! But I will! It meets the expectation for quality fish and ingredients and 5 star staff but let's be real it's in the Wynn and if this place disappointed the Wynn would certainly shut down! But it did not disappoint and all though it was THE most expensive sushi experience ever it was worth it! Can I mention also that this place is 1 of 5 places in the US to offer authentic Kobe Beef? If you have never tasted the real deal you MUST! The Kobe beef here sits at the top AS the greatest thing I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"WOW. If you can afford it, this place is incredible. Hands down best sushi and teppanyaki we have had, and the ambiance is amazing."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant in an amazing setting.  The food wasn't the best that I've had and the service wasn't great.  Started with asking our server about the omakase - which I love doing at new restaurants, especially ones with great repurations.  I'm allergic to most types of gluten, but soy sauce and some other things found in Asian foods don't bother me.  Server mumbled something, of which I thought he said \"Not a problem, we've had two people request it earlier today...\" When I said, \"Great, I'll take it\" he copped a wee bit of an attitude and said \"No, I said that the chef won't do it.\" I then told him that we needed some more time with the menu - and he just walked away.  He came back and as I was asking him questions, still the same attitude, almost annoyed that I had a gluten allergy.  Then he got argumentative with me when I tried to explain that I could eat this certain dish because I wasn't allergic to the gluten product he was describing.  I thought much of this was in my head until, as he walked away, my husband looked at me and said \"I'm over that guy.  I don't know what his problem is.\"  I'm usually low maintenance about my gluten allergy - but I wish that a restaurant at that \"level\" would have been more accommodating and helpful.  The cocktail I had (a pear one) was pretty amazing - the service outside of our main server - was great.  We ended up getting some of the grilled food, some sashimi, sushi, etc.  Not really the most inventive food.  The sashimi I had was cut pretty thick as well (in a bad way).  It was just like any other good sushi joint - nothing that was very special about it at all."}
{"text":"View it great as you can see from the pictures of the place - if you can find a seat within the right angels. Food was ok - not bad, but definitely overpriced. I ate at Wazuzu a couple of times they pretty much offer the same food and drink, but you pay more here. I figured it's the positioning of the restaurant as a \"higher end\" place with a better view that increases the price."}
{"text":"The view was amazing and worth a trip to eat here while in Vegas! Our server was not that great I literally had to grab a bus boy to find our waiter ! Once our appetizers came out and they came out fast we were happy the food was phenomenal we tried the Brussels sprout appetizer with shrimp it was so delish also the scallop roll appetizer was fantastic to share! Everyone enjoyed their meals , drinks & dessert! My only complaint was the server ! Very pricey but with the view and food was a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"It's a great restaurant if you're looking for a special night out - but I wasn't impressed with their miso soup which seems like a pretty basic dish to prepare. And I think their sushi is overpriced for the proportions. They charge about twice what ANY other sushi place I've been to charges. It's delicious and great quality seafood, but I don't think I'd go there again.  If you're not worried about price, then definitely go there. They were able to accommodate our party of 12, although I do recall we had to go grab the waiter at least once so we could order our food. Also, keep in mind they do have a dress code and no children under a certain age are allowed (5 maybe?)."}
{"text":"Nice place like most of Wynn But service does not match the setting The servers are trying and nothing wrong with them personally but service is super slow. This is the fault of MANAGEMENT. THe servers have too much to do with the hoard of patrons there  I guess this is Vegas  Food is good but not excellent especially NOT THE SUSHI/sashimi NOT FRESH Not a true Japanese restaurant more Americanized fusion Unless u alacart no real sashimi or sushi SO BY THe time I got out 2.5 hours of which waiting time was 1.75 hours I smiled paid the discounted bill and walked out as the servers are really really nice Thx"}
{"text":"Hmmm, with so many wonderful Japanese choices in Vegas we were excited about mizumi and left completely underwhelmed. The endamame was bland, the waiter forgot our order of seared tuna sashimi that we were looking forward to. The seared cod entree was very good though, but the grilled fish, chicken and beef entree was amateur at best. Love the Wynn and most of the restaurants and this would be a good place for first timers (great space and lively atmosphere) but too many other good choices in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, cool waterfalls outside/views, attentive staff. Food was a B+ (prepared on the grill which we sat around, Benihana-like).   Not great, not fabulous, but a solid performance and evening. I wouldn't necessarily come back but it was fine for a different evening.  Overall, though, there are far better options in Vegas in terms of food, atmosphere and value."}
{"text":"The food itself was pretty good but at 400 for a family of 4 for teppanyaki I didn't think it was worth the value. The scenery and service was good but the show was barely adequate.   We stayed at the Wynn and when we asked for a reservation we were told it was business casual, men had to wear collared shirts and no athletic footwear and absolutely no sandals. So we bought a shirt for my son and called again for a reservation. We were told again about the dress code and they stressed their guidelines.  We got dressed for dinner and after we ordered in walked a large group of people wearing T-shirts, flip flops, and sweats. Not one person in the restaurants said a word to them. Why have a dress code if you don't enforce it?  Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"It's new, so perhaps Mizumi is working out the kinks.  However, for the price, it should have worked out those kinks before opening.  My friend and I were there this past Sunday.  We arrived without a reservation, but were able to order from the full menu at the bar.  We ordered the tasting menu.  We explained to the bartender that my friend did not eat beef, but the bartender assured us there would be so much food, that we wouldn't even notice.  To that point, I'm not sure what she considered \"so much food,\" but it was 6 tastings total, inclusive of dessert.  Plus, we had eaten at L'Atelier Joel Robochon a few evenings before, so we were recently familiarized with what several tastings looks like, and that it shouldn't be a problem to make some adjustments to the menu due to a diner's dietary restrictions.  The food . . . the first tasting -- which I thought was an amuse bouche thrown in to greet us -- was one chilled oyster with a yuzu and champagne vinaigrette.  I thought it was tasty, but we had better oysters at L'Atelier.  The second tasting was various concoctions on top of 3 bruschetta-like bread slices, one concoction was beef tartare.  I enjoyed all of these, but my friend couldn't eat the beef one.  The third tasting was dry salmon on soba noodles.  I have never disrespected salmon in that way, so I wouldn't expect to pay for such.  The noodles had a good flavor, however.  The fourth tasting was an inedible, bloody kobe beef dish on top of a root vegetable puree (maybe turnip or parsnip) that was overly sweet.  Apart from the fact that my friend couldn't eat this dish, I found it inedible for being poorly prepared.  Part of the problem is that they forgot they had already served us the salmon and brought out more salmon.  Then they took it back to prepare the beef dish, which was obviously rushed and barely cooked.  Apart from that, the flavor was not good.  The last of the savory dishes was sushi, and I could buy better quality at Kroger.  It was sweaty fish on top of rice. The dessert was a sorbet of some sort.  It was okay, but the entire meal was an overall disappointment.  The drinks here are good, however.  And despite the bartender being off-base about the courses being sufficient (or about them being good), she was nice and personable.  But I wouldn't waste money on food at this place.  Or at least not the tasting menu."}
{"text":"As good as the sushi is ...the service equally bad.  You might as well be a stone wall for as much attention the chef may pay to you or your guests. Profanity would be wasted on this place. At over $200 a person someone, anyone might want to ask you how was your food or if you wanted something else. Not here, I had to wave my hands like a flag man at the Indy 500 to get the chef to raise his eyes. Nuff said."}
{"text":"They have a dress code and they do not tell u about it. We had to call the manager and it waisted our time and money. Everyone got past. Ruined our night. Food was okay."}
{"text":"Not a very welcoming staff, place is ok but way overpriced. Seating by the fountain is $125 minimum in drinks alone? Do I have to get so drunk that I can't walk anymore just because I like the fountain area?  They wanted us to wear a jacket? What kind of nonsense dress code is that?  Dine someplace else for a more pleasant dining experience, try Botero around the corner, staff there are much more pleasant."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Japanese restaurant I've ever been to. Incredible sashimi, sushi, drinks, coffee and the cheesecake is absurd in taste and presentation. 10/10"}
{"text":"We had the pleasant experience of dining at Mizumi a couple of nights ago. We had wonderful seats with an obstructed view of the waterfall in the floor to ceiling windows. It was our first time to Mizumi although we had dined at the previous Japanese restaurant that was in the same location many times. We order cocktails and they were very well prepared and I'm very particular and give instructions on exactly how I want mine, and they got it right...perfect really. We then started with the Mizumi Roll which is a lobster roll and it was delicious then we tried a scallop sashimi/ crispy shrimp, avacado, asparagus & jalapeño roll....it was fabulous! We were going to order another dish but changed out mind and ordered another scallop/shrimp roll! Since it's become Mizumi the decorating changes that they made has greatly improved the look and the ambience. It used to lack ambience but the food was good. Now that it's Mizumi it has excellent food and a lovely atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous Japanese-themed restaurant in the Wynn. Ask to sit by the waterfall. Food is contemporary Japanese. However they do have some traditional stuff as well. All very good but not spectacular. A little pricey but u knew that since it's in the Wynn."}
{"text":"Preferred this place when it was Okada.  Yes, the menu items are largely the same, but the prices are higher and the decor is definitely a downgrade IMO.  Too many cheap, fast food Chinese restaurants already have a monopoly on the Asian red theme so rather than it feeling like a high end and upscale restaurant, walking into Mizumi makes me wonder if I'm about to be served General Tso's chicken and a fortune cookie.  But I digress.  I've tried quite a bit of the sushi, sashimi, and special rolls at Mizumi and while they are good, you can certainly do better at other establishments on the strip, and even more so off strip, particularly for the price.  I miss the tasting menus that Okada offered which were actually decent value.  Since the main reason to eat at a restaurant like this in a hotel like the Wynn is the ambiance, there's really no compelling reason to dine here unless you are immune to the Chinese fast food restaurant redness.  I'm not so I won't be going back unless forced."}
{"text":"This place has authentic japanese food, we received great service and they have delicious hot tea with real leafs. Both the hibachi style and the sashimi food are good, but the highlight is the desert - the gueisha face filled with chocolate is a must order!"}
{"text":"My only go to sushi place when I'm in LV!! Absolutely love it here! Servers are very knowledgeable of the menu! My favorite was the specialty spicy tuna!! I got it twice during my 3 day stay!! The crab hand roll was also amazing!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The beauty of the restaurant and the setting are perfect but for me the food is the thing and Mizumi delivers every time. Constant evolution with brilliant new dishes is the trademark. An unbelievable vegetarian roll that even the carnivores wanted more of. The sushi is great but the chef's specials are what makes this place so good. Ask your waiter to point out what's new on the menu and order lots. If you don't know about Robataki try a dozen different sticks and I am betting you will order more."}
{"text":"First time in this restaurant. Came for business and I must say it blew me away! First off, the decor is exquisite. Beautiful rich red room with a panoramic view of a cascading waterfall with lush green trees in surroundings. The vibe is upscale, servers are very well informed and serviceable. Now the food... The freshness of the sushi here is expectational! We had the spicy salmon speciality roll is out of this world. So is the spicy tuna specialty roll. The Brussels sprouts, and the robotakayki is incredible! I can't say enough about my experience here. A must dinner when in vegas if you like sushi!"}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant. The food, atmosphere, drinks and service are great. I recommend the scallop tataki roll and the salmon crunch roll. I was not a big fan of the beef tacos. Overall great service. I defineitly plan on returning."}
{"text":"High price outlet My sushi chef at counter was extremely accommodating , I guess I paid for the deco and service"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with view to the Wynn fountain. Excellent food and good service. Had multiple small dishes that I can't remember the name of them, but I  do remember that they were all great. Some vegetable  dishes I though were overpriced, but there is an assortment of small kabobs that were delicious and good value."}
{"text":"First things first, the atmosphere and the waterfalls in the back while you dine are absolutely breathtaking. The service while attentive and pleasant seemed slow at times. The food while decent wasn't so unique, fresh, and different that I would come back again.   Mizumi ... mehh"}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant!  Great service!  Their sushi is really good here from presentation to taste/quality.  The next time I am in Vegas I would want to come back."}
{"text":"First thoughts... The staff here is great. They definitely exemplify the meaning of service with a smile.  Lucky me I got in early and was seated next to the water. The glass wall was up because its december, but the view into their waterfall was amazing.  Right away when I looked at the menu I knew what to get... the Chef's Omakase menu. 6 courses featuring Mizumi's specialties. I supplemented for the Kobe beef and was not disappointed. I also decided on the Bamboo snow sake. A very good and not too sweet unflitered sake.  Course 1 - scallops  Course 2 - trio plate. Oyster/beef tataki/frog legs Course 3 - mini seafood hot pot Course 4 - kobe beef hot plate Course 5 - sushi/sashimi Course 6 - sorbet and cake Evrything was excellent and cooked perfectly, especially the kobe beef. Since i cooked it myself on a hot stone. Scallops had a perfect sear on the outside and a delicate smooth finish. The oysters with win sauce... just amazing. The beef was tender and offset with crispy onions makes my mouth water when I think about it. And the frog legs... Oh my. The most delicate and delicious frog I've ever had. Lightly battered and fried. The mini seafood hot pot with sea bass, king crab, sea scallop, shrimp and onions with noodles. Balanced with a ponzu dipping sauce. Honestly it didnt need a dipping sauce. Its light and refreshing seafood in a mild broth was enough on its own. Now... The Kobe beef, with all the marbling you would expect. Lightly sear on a stone and dip into 3 of the sauces if desired. Such a succulent piece of beef that over cooking should be a crime. The sushi was very fresh. I don't think the wasabi was ground fresh, but I dont use much anyway. Uni. I dont know how many times i have gotten bad uni. This was not one of those times.  To finish, some sorbet and the fluffiest cake ever with little crumbles of goodness in the bottom.  I highly recommed dinning here. From the staff to the food, its worth the experience. I can't wait to come back and try more dishes from here"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals of my life thus far!!! My husband brought me here for our 9th anniversary tonight! I enjoyed every second of the experience. From the food to the service and the ambiance. Everything flowed cohesively. I will remember this experience for the rest of my life. We enjoyed the plum wine, which was smooth and sweet the spicy yellow tuna shared plate my hot pot. EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant when it was Okada. I returned after the transformation and I have to say I was not impressed. The service was just fine, but the overall experience was not as good. All of the items I had were well done but for this price point there are better places in town. The old space felt much more Japanese to me as well. The new red and gold decor made the whole thing feel Chinese. Again, the quality of the sushi and other hot items was still quite high, although nothing was the best I've ever had. If this is your price level, you would be much better served at Shibuya at MGM Grand."}
{"text":"Beautiful Japanese restaurant that also has a Sushi Bar and Teppan style dining with view of the koi pond and waterfall. We opted for the Teppan sytle where the chef cooks the food in front of you. Very entertaining and fun. The huge vents over the cooking area keeps the atmosphere nice & clean...not smokey like some other places I've been to. We ordered shrimp, beef, fish and lobster which we shared with our group of 7 people. It was delicious and works out well with groups of 4 to 10 people. Next time we will try the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Just had a beautiful anniversary dinner with the girlfriend this past Thursday before flying back home. The place and ambiance is nice. The wait staff and all the employees at this establishment are very attentive BUT not intrusive.  Every dish we had was well put together and visually attractive.   The girlfriend and I had several dishes which were all delicious... Yellow tail sashimi  Scallop tataki and crispy shrimp roll*** Robata platter Crispy Brussels sprouts Wagyu short ribs*** Mask dessert  All the dishes that we had, exceeded our expectations. Japanese flavors with a some French fusion. We likes the fact that every dish was represented and explained what was on the plates.   Thank you Branden and Grant for an awesome dinner and experience.   Next time we are in Las Vegas, we will mark an evening to dine here again."}
{"text":"Good presentation, not too crowded, nice for peaceful dinner with family"}
{"text":"I have gone to many restaurants around the world, by far this was the best! The service the food everything! Stacey was so knowledgeable and so sweet! They had a menu for strict vegetarians and if you like anything on the other menu they can try to still cater to your special diet. Food was so fresh and unique. Every dish was a big \"wow\". This restaurant makes me want to go back to Vegas just because of the food and service. Not only was the food excellent the ambiance was out of this world! Ask for Stacey! She was awesome!"}
{"text":"Nice place with an eclectic style inside. I had Sushi, the specialty rolls were amazing with a great presentation. Fabulous! This place is high priced! I would not recommend this place for anyone who is looking for something more affordable. The sushi ranges from $20 for a roll of 6 pieces to $110 & although the specialty rolls are yummy $85 for one roll is outrageous! If you have the money to spend then I recommend this place. I could definitely see myself going back to try the teppanyaki grills."}
{"text":"Food was great an fresh. Service was incredibly slow."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for?  not in my case.  After walking around the Wynn and looking at their different vegan menus. We decided to settled at Mizumi.   The food was completely bland. The tofu was very bad. It seemed like the chef just pour soy sauce over four mini tofu cubes. Unremarkable. The Miso soup appetizer was nothing especial. The gardein chicken was good but could have been better for the price.   Extremely overpriced.   On the positive side the service was great.  and the view of the waterfall was beautiful.  One star because for the price paid, we could have had a remarkable culinary experience."}
{"text":"The Restaraunt is amazing!  We tried the oysters, edimmome with black truffle salt, the  lobster miso soup, spicy tuna roll and the cod. Delicious! We got a table next to the waterfall and it was breathtaking. Would go back!"}
{"text":"Came in for my birthday. Everyone from hosts to server to bussers was wonderful. Absolutely stunning restaurant and the food was spectacular. Thank you for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi with a memorable view and excellent service.  Everything I tried was some of the best I've had in my life.    The shrimp and vegetable tempura were lightly battered and cooked to a crispy perfection.  The assortment of the vegetables was nicely varied.  It was the first time I had a beet in the tempura ensemble.    The sushi was absolutely fresh and well presented.  The traditional nigiri pieces (tuna, salmon, tomago, hamachi, etc) were all perfect but the one that stood out was the toro.  I have never had such nice pieces of toro before at any sushi place.    The jidori organic chicken, grilled on a skewer under the robatyaki section, was nicely cooked, tender, and well seasoned.  Obviously, this meal will not be cheap so if you're looking for a value, do not bother.  If, however, you and a significant other want one of the best sushi meals with great service and outstanding food and view, you'll want to give Mizumi a try."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would! The service, the atmosphere, the food...all amazing and exceeded my expectations. Our waitress, Stacey, was so great and knowledgeable. We loved everything she suggested for us to try! It was a beautiful meal and we will definitely be returning here when we come back to visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"A fabulous dinner last night at Mizumi convinced me that I needed to come out of my Yelp hibernation and let folks know just how talented Chefs Devon, Kitt and Andrew are, and what a fantastic team they have in Richard (AGM extraordinaire) and Edgar (bartender extraordinaire -- keep those dirty martini's coming!!)   My man and I opted for date night at Mizumi -- Chef Devon (his hugs rock!) customized one of the best meals I've had in Vegas for us many moons ago and we were ready for another night of wow.  And, anyway, who doesn't want to chow down while staring at the famous Wynn waterfall?!!   We were in the mood for cold omakase when Richard shared with us a new program at Mizumi that started just 2 weeks ago: 7 or 10 course cold omakase at Chef Kitt's sushi bar only on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.  Um.... YUP! What followed was heaven.  A totally different take on yellowtail jalapeno (complete with crunchy potato slivers) - check. Toro with minced daikon topped with a quail egg.  Check.  Japanese triggerfish plated so beautifully you (sort of) felt bad for that poor fishy while you relished its tastiness in your mouth.  Check.    If you've ever had the experience where you were so full but couldn't wait to see what else was coming and can't wait for that to happen again, then wait no more! Chef Kitt and his first officer, Chef Andrew, are on it and it won't be long before it's impossible to grab a seat and watch these masters in action. Remember to ask to sit at their sushi area (there are two separate sushi counters at Mizumi), and get ready to eat!   So, RUN (do not walk) to Mizumi, and watch these guys drop it like it's hot... er cold."}
{"text":"We're big fans of high end Japanese restaurants. We lived in Tokyo for many years and have a weak spot for creative sushi rolls and modern takes on Japanese classics. The LV strip has a few high end places to choose from. We've tried most of them and I think Muzumi is the best. It is better than Nobu and Kumi. Kumi was a previous favorite but lost the magic last year. So this trip we chose Mizumi and were satisfied from tongue to belly to wallet.   Great rolls, they don't try too hard or overdo it in wild or heavy sauces. We had three rolls in our 3 person group and loved each. There's a pleasant taste of classic Japanese sushi rolls in Mizumi's selection.   Sides and entrees were delightful. Loved the perfectly cooked miso cod which melts in your mouth with just the right level of miso sweetness. The robata platter was just awesome. Again a reminder of Tokyo flavors but with some added high-end delight. The nigiri standard sushi fish quality was some of the best we've ever had in the US or Japan.  Some excellent sake and beer selections. Some hard to find. Delish!   You don't visit this kind of place for value but we left with a bill slightly less than what we paid for similar but inferior meals at Nobu and most recently Kumi. Mizumi is the best of its kind that we have found on maybe eight or nine trips to vegas over the past five years."}
{"text":"If you looking for fine dine Japanese place with food food but less quantity then this is the place! We had sushi and bi bam Baap food was just awesome! Very very high quality with food flavors! Must try if you are Japanese cuisine fan! Though their desserts are ok! I would say go with appetizers and main course!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner here last night, the restaurant is very beautiful and they sat us in a perfect spot with a beautiful view of the waterfall. We started out with a miso soup which was delicious and ordered a sushi sashimi combination plate. The presentation was beautiful but the rice used to make the sushi was almost like a paste. Truth be told I still ate the sushi, but my wife wasn't happy, she is Asian and live in Japan for 10 Years. We eat Japanese food often so we have much to compare the sushi to. I still enjoyed my dinner because of the atmosphere but only wish the dinner was better."}
{"text":"Oh where to start?! What fun and unique atmosphere for a night out! What's even better is that not only can you enjoy the atmosphere, they offer some super scrumptious food too!! Five stars all around! Started with the udon soup which is amazingly filling, then followed with several sushi rolls, each of which were delicious and made me regret not having more room to enjoy since the udon soup made me so full!! We also celebrated my birthday during our visit and they made me feel special with a complementary dessert! Such a wonderful vibe and deliciously satisfying meal - making all my birthday wishes come true!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant thinking the food would be overpriced and mediocre. well, it was not mediocre. my boyfriend and I ordered the Toro tartare, 72-hr braised short ribs, lobster miso soup, yellowtail sashimi, tuna sashimi, king crab sashimi, salmon egg sashimi, and an order of the grilled shisito peppers. The toro came out first and was perfection. buttery fatty mild yet fresh. then came our sashimi and soup. the sashimi must be the freshest I have ever had in town and I am a local. miso soup is miso soup. nothing spectacular on that front. now, the short rib! boy, I don't have enough to say about how amazing they were. The presentation was...forget it. Forget the presentation. The fucking meat was so tender I felt I could have given it a glance and it would have fallen apart. I didn't want my shirt rib experience to be over truly an eat-with-your-eyes-shut-type deal. I am telling you. Get it. Your wallet might regret it but your taste buds won't."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance followed up by great service. The restaurant is located inside the Wynn hotel-- what more can you expect right?  Japanese decor inside and out. Sushi, nigri, robata grill, and hibachi items on the menu. Ordered a few things off the appetizer and robata grill menu. YUM-O!  Blackened miso cod-- delish and almost breaks down in your mouth as you eat it. Uni butter pasta - small portion, but very tasteful and rich. Sea bass - also small portion but flavorful and nearly \"melts\" in your mouth.  Everything was great, as well as dessert. Creme brulee (never a fail) and the sorbet."}
{"text":"Great food and great service from Sean!  Must try the Yellowtail Sashimi and Jalapeno Gelee. Another great roll is the Spicy Tuna Arare.   We were seated as soon as we walked in (reservations were made) and right by the window overlooking the waterfall.   Overall we were very satisfied with the quality and freshness of the sushi and the service. Also, it helps that the restaurant was beautiful."}
{"text":"This restaurant, wow!!  Ambiance: A++ You won't feel like you are in the dessert with the amazing water feature and stunning decor. Staff: A++ Helpful, attentive, funny, I could not have asked for a better experience Food: A bit pricey, but as would be expected in Las Vegas.  We opted for three sushi rolls  plus the tuna tataki starter.  Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"The cocktails are a knockout in creativity and execution.  The sashimi and cooked dishes we tried were incredible.  The menu is very specific about where everything's sourced.   The best part was the service. Attentive, knowledgeable, and just enough."}
{"text":"The beast sushi in Las Vegas, I would highly recommend to try their mizumi roll. Also went back to try their teppanyaki next day, the angus beef was to die for. Very friendly staff. It's not a cheap place, but I'll definitely go there again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I tried Chef Hashimoto's Omakase menu for $125. It is a great way to try different dishes if you are unfamiliar with the menu or the restaurant.   It consists of 6 courses.  1. Grilled scallop topped with some caviar - flavorful 2. 3 bite size starters picked by the Chef (frog leg, Angus Beef Tataki, and Chillden Shigoku Oyster) - the beef tataki was absolutely delicious and the oyster was very sweet 3. Kami Nabe Hot Pot - the soup was very tasty 4. Kurobuta Katsu - absolutely delicious. It was topped with mayonnaise and shredded green apples which helps balance out the oiliness of the katsu 5. Assorted nigiri and a cut roll - Their seafood are very fresh, very delicious 6. Green tea panna cotta with pistachio crumbles - My favorite course out of the 6. I am huge on dessert, but I don't like them too sweet. This course is just sweet enough but not over the top. It is unforgettable.  In terms of service, the waiters and waitress were very nice and professional. They were attentive but not overbearing.   The only con I felt was the speed food gets served. Initially the pace was good, but we have a gap in between course 4 and 5. If it wait wasn't that long, it would've been a perfect experience."}
{"text":"Gluten and dairy friendly. However, I'm sure not nearly as amazing as everyone else's dishes. Great place for dinner before Intrigue Nigh Club.  Sorbet and edamame were good. Nice dinner views of you are seated by the waterfall."}
{"text":"Mizumi is a reincarnation of Okada.  If you're familiar with Okada, then Mizumi will be no surprise to you.  The food items are the same as before so there are little differences, save the name and decorations.  The sashimi is still fresh as ever and the grilled items are cooked perfectly.    My favorites included the lobster sashimi, the uni, the amaebi, the crab miso.  If you're staying at the Wynn/Encore and don't want to venture out for food, this is a good place to eat at."}
{"text":"Way overpriced and the food was just okay, been to better Japanese steakhouses at a fraction of the cost, only get the sushi if you want to eat here."}
{"text":"Talk about a beautiful dining experience! The waterfall and glass windows are absolutely stunning. Everything about our meal at Mizumi was amazing. The restaurant, the wait staff, and of course, the food was spectacular! To start we shared the vegetable tempura and seared octopus salad, both were fantastic! For our meals we had the Jidori Chicken, the Scallop Tataki and Crispy Shrimp Roll, a Spicy Tuna Arare Roll, and the Seared Albacore Sashimi. The table favorite was the Spicy Tuna Arare Roll, and I can honestly say that all four of us would go back just for the Tuna Roll! It was seriously amazing. For dessert, the four of us shared a Chocolate Mask and the Honey Toasts with vanilla ice cream and apricot preserves. While the chocolate mask is stunningly beautiful, the honey toasts took the cake! So different and unique but so so delicious. We cannot wait to return to Mizumi!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've ever had was at Mizumi. From the staff to the food and the amazing ambience,  I don't think it could've gotten any better.         We were seated outside on the patio just feet away from one of the Wynn's several waterfalls and quickly forgot we were in the middle of the Las Vegas strip. Our server, Akiko was extremely knowledgeable in the various types of sake that was available and made our selection process quite simple.          We ordered a couple of classic sushi rolls to start, the Philadelphia the yellow tail scallion and my fiancé's favorite the sweet egg nigiri. We also had the seared Kabocha (pumpkin) with honey. Simply put, fresh, simple, and delicious. Followed that up with the Hamachi Kama (which was a 1st for me having it cooked since I normally eat it raw). The best Hamachi I have ever had by far! Ended it all with an assortment of mochi ice cream and was a very happy guy! The portions were very generous as I left completely stuffed and extremely satisfied.           To my surprise, when the bill came for my fiancé and I after all we ate and drank (bottle of sake, a blue Mizumi and 2 glasses of champagne) we were still under $100 bucks. Needless to say, I will definitely be back! Much Mahalo to Andrea, Sammie, Akiko and the rest of the staff for making my marriage proposal a memorable one! (She said yes!)"}
{"text":"One of the best quality sushi restaurants I've been too. Can't get enough of this place! Located inside the wynn hotel so parking is very easy, just valet and walk right in. I've never had an issue with making a reservation here I usually just walk in and am seated right away. They have a great wine selection that's perfect for pairing with fish or any of their food. The staff here and so kind and they constantly check on you making sure your food is tasting great and they give awesome recommendations.   Their sushi is so fresh and beautiful when it comes to you.  They have \"hot plates\" as well and one of my absolute favorites it the Miso black cod. The way it's cooked makes it literally melt in your mouth. I also love to get the Brussel sprouts for the table as it's a perfect sharing side plate. It's lightly friend and tossed in balsamic and salt and pepper.  A great roll to start off for the table is the rainbow roll, it's a bunch of different fish on a California roll made with real crab!  Can't wait to come back to this place as they always are on the top with their food and staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful and my experience was wonderful! The food was fantastic! I highly recommend Mizumi and I will be going back the next time I am in Las Vegas (great for a birthday dinner - dessert was delicious)!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge teppenyaki fans so we were excited to try this place out.  While the service was really excellent, the cost per meal was incredibly overpriced.  We ended up spending around $200 with no alcohol, no special view (since we did teppenyaki and that was in another room) and we hadn't ordered anything very fancy.  The food itself was good but was nothing extraordinary.  Also, the veggie portion was pretty small.  Both of us thought that we probably would've had just as good of a meal at another teppenyaki spot like Benihana."}
{"text":"Probably not one of my favorite sushi places. Definitely not traditional Japanese. First time trying deep fried frog legs and quail. If you're into adventurous foods, this is the place for you"}
{"text":"mizumi takes fine dining to another level!  the view during dinner is simply breathtaking.  ambiance, decor, service are everything you'd expect from a world class casino restaurant.  the food wasn't remarkable but very good.  one thing that was lacking was creativity in the dishes served.  i was expecting more than just a \"typical\" sushi dinner here.  overall, the dining experience at mizumi is one you will never forget."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I celebrated my birthday here before and it was a great experience. For drinks, get the blueberry lychee drink! It's soooo good. Before you order, the waiter will ask if you have any allergies. I said seafood. They then bring out the chef to discuss meal options to make sure nothing gets contaminated. I came here for their yakitori. They even did a grill change for me which I appreciated. Almost all of their yakitori is all tasty.   I also ordered the vegetarian udon to go with my meal. Love that the Wynn offers vegetarian options.  I got a special dessert platter and cake for my bday!! Very cute"}
{"text":"This is Fine Dining.  We had an early dinner so the place was quiet which made it more mysterious and romantic.  We scored the best location in the house, next to the koi pond filled with rocks, foliage, and a cascading waterfall.  Our server was a great at recommending dishes to us.  We took most of her suggestions.   Mizumi Mixed Green Salad Included daikons, carrots, and wafu dressing - Refreshing starter  Seared Foie Gras Small qty but big in flavor. It was combined with other stuff to compliment the rich texture. - Excellent  Scallop Tataki and Crispy Shrimp Roll - It was good but it had so much stuff in there that the taste of scallop was overwhelmed.   Fresh scallops have a subtle sweetness, I think it needs to be eaten by itself without other competing flavors."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at Wynn for three nights for our exciting vacation .the first night we arrived at hotel we both like the hotel very much so we decided dining here , I am Asian and have also lived Japan for almost ten years. And Ive always liked to eat Sashimi and Sushi all the time, we live in California Orange County where there are many Japanese restaurant from high end ???? to Izakaya.  Seeing the yelp's high recommendation, there were no hesitations on going to Izumi. The presentation is as beautiful as the ambiance of the restaurant , but unfortunately the food is not what we expected, sashimi is just ok, not great. the worst part is the sushi , the rice taste like paste and was so sticky and  left an unpleasant feeling in my mouth . I told the waiter about how I felt all he said was yes I will tell our manager but after that never appeared again. We were so disappointed at, not only the food but the service too."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi restaurant. By far thee best sushi experience I've had. Ordered the Mizumi Sushi Platter for 2. It was more than enough food. Nigiri, Sashimi, & Sushi. I would definitely recommend be eating here."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Abalone and Uni. This is the Freshest I've had it has no smell taste so sweet  The place has a great view and its inside the Wynn casino."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really nice- I really love the waterfall!   The service was also decent.   The part I wasn't particularly impressed with was the food. For the price it really wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Vegas! Staff is incredibly nice and attentive. I've had several of their sushi rolls all are very good! Mine and my boyfriends favorite thing to order is the arara spicy tuna roll and the tuna tataki.   They do have a dress code business casual. I also suggest making reservations before hand because they do get busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"Went to Mizumi located in the Wynn for dinner. Loved it and would definitely go back in the future.  Pros: - Loved their seared foie gras. It was very well cooked and it isn't too often nowadays to find seared foie gras due to the ethical issues going on. - They have a man made waterfall with a pond right outside of the restaurant that you can view through floor-ceiling windows. Pretty cool and makes you feel very isolated from Vegas. There is seating on the deck next to the waterfall but you probably have to make a special request for that. - Excellent salmon sashimi. The fish was very very fresh. It was not chewy when you bite into it and the salmon just tore apart easily while retaining its shape. My girlfriend and I always get salmon sashimi whenever its offered at restaurants and this is one of the best places we've had in a while. - Miso cod was great as usual. Sweet and perfectly flakely. - I really enjoyed their cherry shaved ice dessert. A great light dessert with a great balance of sweet with the condensed milk and acidity with the cherry.  Cons: - Service was just slightly slower than I would have liked but not a big deal."}
{"text":"4 stars for the decor and service, 3 stars for the food. The restaurant is completely stunning, and I will definitely come back during the warmer months so I can grab a table outside by the waterfall. I ordered a few pieces of sashimi, nigiri, and the oxtail fried rice. Everything was solid, but nothing to go crazy about. It is pricey, but the experience was lovely."}
{"text":"I have been to Mizumi three times now - yum. The atmosphere is really what keeps bringing me back, but the food is great and the servers are nice enough.  ATMOSPHERE: Mizumi was renovated in the past couple of years and the interior is now a lush red and gold - unless I'm losing my mind, I recall there being a large, gold fish near the sushi bar. But what really sets this place apart is the wall-size window on the waterfall outside. It's incredible. Be sure to try and sit near the window. There is even a private table outside (F&B minimum) right by the waterfall that I've been dying to have a reason to book. Someday. Kind of awkward, though, when you leave Mizumi and you have to walk by the loooooong line of guys and gals waiting to get into Tryst nightclub downstairs. Oh, well.  FOOD: If you like sushi/nigiri, you have come to the right place. Robatayaki is good, but small portion-wise. Sharing is good. Try new things.  DRINKS: Similar drink menu to other properties in the Wynn, but good. Nothing to blow your mind, though. Go with wine.  SERVICE: Our service has varied, but the people have always been nice. Nothing to really set this place apart, but   TIPS: Be sure to request a table near the waterfall window when you make your reservation. The birthday dessert (last time we were there) is a free series of mochi flavors - cute."}
{"text":"I don't hand out 5 stars, but this place was FABULOUS! Sushi is perfectly executed and the views make you forget you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday night, 9:30 reservation.  I had the Mizumi roll, which was excellent.  I tried a couple Robayaki skewers and then finished with their Jindori Chicken.  All the food was prepared very well and had great flavor.  The restaurant service was a bit weak, but it was fairly busy.  Great place to people watch as there was quite the variety.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"Blown away.  100% must order the spicy tuna with avo soy paper hand rolls - best EV.  The brussel sprouts are also delicious.  The staff is very kind and were willing to make off menu items.  Great service."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! The service is friendly and professional and the food is sublime. The restaurant itself is exquisite, request a table with a waterfall view and enjoy"}
{"text":"So my previous experience here had some service issues that caused me a significant amount of concern.   The General Manager reached out to me and took the time to speak with me via email and phone about my visit. Due to her extremely professional and attentive care, I took the time to go back to Las Vegas and pay another visit to the restaurant. Asking me to give Mizumi a second chance is no small request due to the high number of excellent restaurants in the city. The fact that I decided to trust her and make another visit speaks volumes for the level of her attention to my concerns.   This visit was immensely better than my previous. All service issues were addressed. The food and service was excellent and I had the pleasure of dealing with one of the more enjoyable sommelier I have ever had at a service. I am pleased to say that this visit was better than I expected and I am very pleased that my concerns were addressed so well. This is exactly why I love the Wynn property and why I return time and time again.   Strong strong 4 plus stars. Keep up the great work Andrea!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Sit near waterfall if possible. The sashimi platter (good - as expected), Brussels sprouts (better than expected), and the robata platter (best - great variety) we're all great. For the price it met expectations (80 per person). Perfect before seeing la rev. Would come back again"}
{"text":"Amazing! The food and the wait staff were lovely. I'd absolutely go again for another special occasion."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Mizumi. While the food was decadent, the service was amazing (props to Stacey for being my silver lining -- but more on that later), what absolutely topped my experience was learning that restaurants (in Vegas no less) have dress codes which necessitate the staff to keep loaner pants on hand. Arriving in bright white shorts, I learned just how myopic my view of the world was. I was greeted with two options -- go back to the hotel and change or wear loaner pants. Needless to say, I chose the latter. Can I just say that I rocked those loaner pants! Never mind the fact that they a) didn't zip up, b) didn't button and c) made me glad I was wearing a long blue polo. I think in hindsight is was actually recognition by the staff, based on my body dimensions, on just how much I was about to consume. Our waitress (with 11 years of experience at the restaurant, mind you) said I was merely her second example of someone wearing loaner pants. I took this to mean I was only the second person naive enough to think that dress codes didn't exist at a hotel restaurant in Las Vegas. Will I be back? Heck ya. Next time I'll ask for the accompanying blazer."}
{"text":"I came by myself  since my husband had a business dinner, but the hostess was so gracious and welcoming.  They seated me at an open table but I saw a table by the window with a view of the waterfall. I asked if i could sit there instead and then realized it'd just been vacated and wasn't ready yet. But they were so nice and had me sit down while they prepped the window table.  I ordered the brussel sprouts and the sashimi platter. It was way too much food for one person. The sashimi portions are very large and even though priced at $60, definitely enough for 2 people.  I couldn't stop eating the brussels sprouts - so delicious - very similar to the sprouts at Katsuya. I would definitely enjoy another meal here when I return to Vegas. Yuko was my server - so very nice and helpful.  I really enjoy being able to come to a beautiful restaurant and feel comfortable dining alone."}
{"text":"All the food was absolutely amazing and very tasteful. We had the yellowtail sashimi, Mizumi roll, spicy tuna roll & salmon rollfrom the specialty rolls & the tuna tartare trio. For dessert we had the chocolate mask, mochi ice cream variety and green tea pannacotta.  Not only every dish was good but they were very helpful with a shellfish allergy, customizing rolls.  The only reason why I don't give this restaurant 5 stars was due to the service being a little slow when they were not busy at all."}
{"text":"At the Wynn for a conference and took a client here one night.  We asked the waiter to bring us the \"greatest hits\" and he nailed it. Food was fantastic, service was really good. Two in our party cant have pork so we asked the waiter to let us know if anything contained pork - over the next hour at least 6 different employees of the restaurant brought food to the table and every single one said pork or no pork - that was very impressive.  Very expensive but this is a top shelf place"}
{"text":"Cool ambiance at this place.  The masks on the wall are interesting.  The service is good.  There are plenty of vegan options if you do no like sushi.  I however do love sushi.  The miso soup was tasty.  Good stuff.  I tried several rolls all of which were tasty.  Do they justify the price?  Probably not, but it is Vegas after all.  I would return."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant!! Luv the decor & the layout!! The view of the waterfalls is done superbly!! And the food, very very good! Delishhhh!!!  A perfect place to take someone special!! Servings are in good portion!  I enjoyed my dinner with the girls!!!"}
{"text":"The only positive thing I can say about this visit is that the service was friendly. The decor was nice as well, but the room was freezing and it was uncomfortable to eat while being cold. However, it tends to be the thing in a casino.  My issues arouse from the food itself. My friend and I decided to go big and get the Omakase for $125 per person at 5-6 courses. The food was just \"meh.\" The Uni Risotto was strangely bland and the weird; breaded Wagyu beef dish was just...well, weird. I took a couple bites and couldn't eat anymore. Made me sad that the meat was prepared in this way.   The sushi was pretty good, but not exceptional. And when I went back to my room at my hotel later that night, I became quite ill. Being that I only shared 1 carafe of sake with my friend and had nothing else to eat since breakfast- I feel positive my upset stomach was due to the meal I ate at Mizumi.   Pretty much the last thing anyone needs is to become ill while on a trip, and being that the food was average and overpriced- and most likely the culprit of my agony at 2 in the morning- I would suggest steering clear."}
{"text":"Our third time here and just as good as the first ! Gorgeous setting and ambiance !  Excellent service. Presentation of every dish is beautifully done. You can't go wrong with anything you choose but save place for desert. Chocolate mousse mask is heaven ! Once again Wynn/Encore proves to be on the top of all hotels in Vegas whether you are staying here or coming for dinner. Thank you !"}
{"text":"This was probably our best meal this trip to Vegas.  The tasting menu was solid.  The pairing, while not always the best pairing, was well presented and the sake was delicious.  Service started cold but everyone was friendly by the time we left.  Yeah, pretty good meal!"}
{"text":"Had such a wonderful birthday dinner here. The restaurant was absolutely beautiful, the staff was kind and professional, the food was very high end.   I'll list out some food we got that we enjoyed very much: the lobster miso soup was the best we both ever had! So full of flavor. We also got the beef tartar with the quail egg. Exquisite! We ordered the $125 chefs choice sushi/nigiri platter for 2 people. The cuts of fish were very well prepared and the couple of sushi rolls that were selected were scrumptious.   For dessert, I got the geisha mask dish. Such a fun experience eating it!   If we ever come back to Vegas, we will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, especially for the price. $20 for a glass of wine that was from a $10 bottle, is ridiculous. The meat (i had the beef sirloin) and the veggies were good quality....however they were over-seasoned with salt, garlic and soy sauce.  The waitress was extremely slow. The teppanyaki chef did the usual onion tower and egg roll jokes, but nothing original. He also accidentally dropped sauteed vegetables in my lap (on an expensive white skirt that will now need to be dry cleaned). Overall, unimpressed and overpriced!"}
{"text":"FOOD - 5+ Ordered the tasting menu - felt like I was on an episode of Iron Chef.  Creative, beautifully plated, and fresh (esp. for seafood where they have to fly it in). DRINKS - 5.  We did the wine pairing.  They even had a beer pairing for one of the courses. SERVICE - 5.  The server was funny and very nice!  The sommelier left the bottles at the table for me to take pics. PRICE - 4.  This is not a inexpensive meal, but it was well worth it.  Definately a place for special occasions - my favorite Japanese restaurant.  Favorites: Sweet shrimp w/ foie gras Ramen noodles with poached egg  Additional Notes:   I haven't been to Las Vegas in a decade.  We ate at many top restaurants for lunch and dinner, but this one stood out and was one definately amazing.  A must try, but it is $$$.  Also, we had an amazing view of the man-made waterfall from inside the restaurant, but the room was very open and as though you were outdoors."}
{"text":"Great experience from the food to the atmosphere to the service...WOW. The hostess Madeline was wonderful, so sweet she took the time to acknowledge our anniversary and gave us a great table!"}
{"text":"Place is ok nothing to brag about I think the okada was a lot better before this place opened in its place. With so many good local places off the strip to go to I would not go back."}
{"text":"Disappointing & overpriced. When you first walk into this place, it is absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately, that's about all that is good about this place. We were seated promptly and greeted by our server's helper. When our server came over, she was very pushy about us placing our order. We told her to give a few more minutes but she kept coming over and it was very irritating. The place is huge, like most Vegas restaurants, but only about 1/3 full. I don't know why she was rushing us to order, it wasn't like they needed the table. We ordered a bottle of wine from one of the most expensive wine lists I've ever experienced. We ordered one sushi roll at $30 each. Yes, that's right $30! It was good, but not $30 good. For that price it should have been the best I ever had. We also had 6 oysters on the half shell ($26) which were the smallest oysters I've ever seen. I don't know how good these oysters really were because they were drenched with vinegar. You don't drench quality oysters in sauces or vinegar if you want to really appreciate them. My wife ordered the ocean trout, which as far as I could tell by the texture, color and taste, this was identical to Scottish salmon. My wife thought she got the wrong order, and when we questioned our server she wasn't positive either, and went to ask the cook. She came back and told us that this was the correct order. We eat salmon all the time, and I'm sure anyone tasting this who is familiar with salmon, would identify it as salmon too. our server came back a second time to tell us that it is in the salmon family. So much for that, but the fish was overcooked and dry. I had the Robatta platter and the beef and chicken were overcooked and dry. The shiitake mushrooms were rubbery and had no flavor. With tip and tax our bill was almost $250. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Honestly I wouldn't come back. I think sushi samba is better and less expensive."}
{"text":"probably the best place i have ever eaten in Las Vegas. the service was exceptional, the food was phenomenal, im a sushi snob and this place blew me away. i highly highly recommend this place for anyone who is a fan of sushi or any Japanese cuisine, or even if you've never tried it your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"We are glad to find another Japanese favorite. We love Nobu and this comes close. Their cocktails are okay, a little sweet for my preference. Japanese 12 yr scotch is a winner. We tried ala carte. They also have an Omakase tasting menu. The yellow tail sashimi, tuna tataki, albacore sashimi were the best on the raw bar. Foie Gras , Brussel sprouts, and Sirloin with truffle sauce were the cooked delights. The desserts seemed okay. We got the chocolate mask which wS too sweet for my liking . Great service, waterfall views."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The food is incredible and the restaurant is stunning.  Can't say enough good things about it.  If you like champagne cocktails get the Wynns signature cocktail (available anywhere in the Wynn or Encore) called *The Dream. It's almost too pretty to drink! Almost... but I managed. And it's delicious.  The service is always fantastic and the atmosphere is fun and sexy and elegant.  Do yourself a favor and go.  Mention my name.....and they won't know who I am or care."}
{"text":"5 stars! I have been to Vegas over 20 times and always thought the food scene was overrated, until I ate at Mizuni. By far the best sushi on the Las Vegas strip - we ordered a couple of pieces of salmon and snapper - they were very well cut. We also ordered the Tuna Arare and yellowtail scallion rolls - both were amazing. The Japanese mushroom pomegranate  salad and vegetarian miso soup were delicious as well. The honey toast desert perfect. The service is what you would expect from a high end restaurant - I had allergies to shell fish - the chef came and spoke to me and mentioned they would separately wash all the utensils again before preparing my meal to avoid contact. One of best places to take a date on the Las Vegas strip. Getting a seat by the waterfall."}
{"text":"Um. I think maybe it's just a common theme in Vegas, but Mizumi lived up to the stereotype of highly overpriced mediocre food.  The pros: The service was great. Very attentive, friendly, and informative. It was my birthday and they sent out a lovely special dessert with a candle. The Teppanyaki chef was great, and did some awesome tricks! Lastly, the ambiance was nice, and the view of the waterfall was beautiful.  Cons: The food was good. Was it 70-100 dollar a plate good? NO! It was good, but not spectacular, and definitely not fine dining quality.   All of that being said, I don't really think it's Mizumi's fault. All of the food that I have had on my trip so far has been exorbitantly overpriced for what you get. So...when in Vegas? I dunno."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and I thought it was overpriced but decent sushi. I prefer Nobu or Koi but always thought it was ok. Yesterday, they stuffed 6 guys into 2 small tables. We asked multiple times for a different table, offered to wait but no feedback at all. They forgot our drink orders but charged us anyways. The food came out of order and was ok quality. Disappointing when you realize how overpriced it is. Water was rarely refilled. The service was so bad it became a joke and form of entertainment for the evening. After we got the bill with the FRAUDULENT charges, we chatted with someone that claimed to be a manager. She offered to bring our drinks after our dinner had completed, but at no time offered to take the drinks off the bill. TOTAL JOKE. We begrudgingly paid for the drinks and food that we didn't receive and even tipped our awful waitress 20%. $650 and NO goodwill was offered by anyone in management. Even bad restaurants offer something when their service and experience are so poor... It's not like we had a $20 bill and wanted free drinks... $650 and no water refill or drinks, AWFUL... It actually surprises me that they can have such poor service and be located inside the Wynn. Most of the restaurants inside of Encore and Wynn have outstanding service and product. Stay away from this place. Go to KOI or Nobu."}
{"text":"One of the coolest restaurants I have visited from an interior decorating perspective.  Lively and high energy place with no nonsense quality ingredients cooked simple.  Really funny experience for a group.  Chef's really make the difference at a Japanese Steakhouse and Mizumi's really nail it."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. It's exactly like the Steve Wynn commercial in the cabs- they have a sushi bar, dining room, and teppanyaki style dining- the one that I tried, though I had some sushi too.   The place is decked out in a bright red color with a modern theme, and overlooks two waterfalls, one of which is the one that can be seen at the nightclub Tryst, directly underneath this place.   The Teppanyaki room is seated every 30 minutes so be on time, otherwise you'll have to wait until the next seating. Because of this, though, I had some sushi at the sushi bar which was excellent. The avocado was perfectly ripe, the rice well prepared, and ingredients were high quality.   Everything on the Teppanyaki menu is set- it comes with a salad, soup, and mochi dessert in addition to whatever you'd like to order as your main protein. The show was good but he didn't do as many tricks as I'd hoped, and I was told by my friend it just depends on the chef you have that night.   It's ideal to come here in a group of 8 so you can have the whole table to yourself, but all in all, this is BY FAR my favorite restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"First night in Vegas means that I was ready to spend some money on good food since I wasn't going to spend my money anywhere else since I'm only 20 years old.  And Mizumi definitely exceeded my expectations. Most restaurants are so focused on the ambiance and the designs that they lack in customer service and the quality of food, but Mizumi is a triple threat!  Started out my dinner with the Robata Platter, which consists of sea bass, chicken, and beef. And wow, the sea bass tasted delicious! It was cooked to perfection and didn't have any smell to it whatsoever.   The main dish I had ordered was the Angus Beef Sirloin and Black Truffle Teriyaki. Again, the beef was cooked to my expectations of medium rare, and the Teriyaki sauce poured on top on my meat was a perfect combination. I believe it's one of the best Teriyaki sauce I've tasted in my life.   I was lucky enough to make reservations a week before I arrived in Vegas, which allowed me to sit right in front of the Wynn waterfall. It definitely added to my experience, getting to dine in front of such a beautiful view.  Complimentary Mochi and fresh fruits and a birthday candle since it was my friend's birthday :)"}
{"text":"Even though the restaurant was empty, they hostess let us know that the only tables available were the outdoor tables by the waterfall.  They had a minimum of $150 pp, so we figured we might as well splurge on a meal and get the tasting menu.  The service was great, as were the drinks.  The food definitely did not meet my expectations.  Perhaps the fish in Houston is fresher, but the food at Mizumi just didn't do it for me.    They asked if we had any food allergies, and I told them I was allergic to peanuts.  Since I couldn't have the dessert that was part of the tasting menu, they brought out sorbet for me (and charged me for it!!)."}
{"text":"Seriously, one of my favorite spots in Vegas! I'm Japanese cuisine lover, and this place is unique. I love their red interior that makes place warm and vibrant. Ask be seated with the view of the fall- it will bring tranquility and relax while you dining. TIP: I like getting here a little bit earlier around 6-6.30, the place is still quiet and not busy, and you can fully enjoy the experience.  Definitely the place to try!"}
{"text":"I just came back from my last visit in '15.  Great atmosphere, our server Anthony was very knowledgeable about the restaurant.  We got a table which incorporates an amazing view of the lake indoors (right behind the glass screen).  There is outdoor seating right next to the waterfall but it's easy to forget you're in Las Vegas due to the atmosphere (which is certainly a compliment).  I'm sure there's a perfect season to go out and (there's heaters if you're going in the Winter) but I didn't see any fans out for the Summer.   Music choice was a bit interesting since it was Pop music from what I remember.  Not sure what I expected for the atmosphere the restaurant gives off. Mizumi - or the Japanese spelling Misumi - means beautiful women in Japanese which is why Steve Wynn named it Mizumi.   The fish was fresh, and the sashimi list provides information about where various fishes come from.  I found it interesting when I asked our server if the eggs in the sweet egg omelette actually came from Las Vegas & he said they did.    The kitchen doesn't have a preset way the items are brought out (example: Bringing out heavier hot dishes first and presenting lighter dishes at the end of the meal).  The food comes out when it's ready.  If that's your preference like mine then it's probably something to be brought up.  Our plates came out in this exact order: Toro Tataki(ala carte from sushi platter) came out with the Foie Gras (hot plates).  The toro tataki was great quality and a pricier dish but you definitely get a hefty amount for what you pay for.  It's paired with taro chips (yes toro with taro chips lol).  It was more of curiosity when ordering the Foie Gras.  Chef David Hashimoto worked under Alex (French) restaurant before so he incorporated his french cullinary background in this dish.  It's definitely not Japanese (lol) so if you're a foie gras lover like I am then I would recommend this dish. The Foie Gras ended being a mix of sweet, salty, and tart flavors.  Next came out couple orders of nigiri(light) which came out fresh next to the Scallop Tataki and Crispy Shrimp Roll (rich).  The fish was great quality and I would recommend the roll for individuals who steer away from raw fish.      We were lastly presented with the pork belly from the robatayaki menu.  It was delicious, extremely rich, and I would recommend it.    Didn't save room for dessert sadly.  I recommend window seating if available."}
{"text":"It was a nice place, and it looked pretty but honestly for the price of the food. Eh. I mean the plus is they have a full vegan & vegetarian but hey every restaurant at the wynn does. I expected more..... I love the wynn & encore personally. It's my favorite hotel & casino because it's nice & theres crystals & butterflies everywhere lol & the best clubs and hey every restaurant has vegan.... (idk how this became a wynn review sorry.... #yelpingyelper) don't get me wrong the food was good but it wasn't WOW. The dessert was probably my favorite lol because everything else was basic."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Great quality, the sushi, the shashimi the lobster miso soup the meat everything was great. Somebody here should teach lakeside to be a little more like them. No way that place is in the same complex as this one. Way above lakeside! Definitely recommended and we will be back"}
{"text":"Visited Las Vegas with just my wife. It's been a long time since the two of us went on a vacay by ourselves. Ate at mizumi at the wynn while we were there. Simply awesome dinner from start to finish. Had the omakase menu (chef's line up) and every single dish was great. My wife supplemented the pork for kobe beef (extra charge $) which just melted in your mouth and was well worth the experience. Service was exceptional from the hostess to the waiter and servers/runners. Highly recommend this place to everyone who is visiting or lives in Las Vegas. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First off the ambiance and service are 5 stars without a doubt. As far as the Food, I have to say by far the WORST and MOST OVERPRICED SUSHI EVER.  We walked in and were told the restaurant was booked for the evening so we had to eat at the Bar.  They did thought about 30 minutes into our visit find us a seat, that was greatly appreciated.    I am a True Sushi Lover and always like trying new places, we ordered the Edamame with Truffle Oil, which was $10, also a Rainbow Roll for $28.00 thought it would be the best roll I had ever had, disappointingly the fish was so cut so thinly I thought it was worth about $8.99 and they didn't ever put masago on it, we also ordered a Chef recommended Scallop Roll for $30.00 we had to send that bad it was so bad.  We had a Philadelphia Roll for $12.00 that was the nights winner!  We also ordered the Miso Cod, for I believe $30.00, it was bland,  I have had better in places that only charged $9.00 and Lamb for $40.00 that didn't even have decent sauce, I have had better for $12.00.  Overall the food quality was OK but nothing to write home about.  The restaurant has a huge glass wall that overlooks a massive waterfall outside, the only highlight of our night, we took some wonderful pictures.  I would highly recommend having a couple $15.00 beers and taking some great pictures on the terrace in front of the waterfall but do not waste your time eating this overpriced crap.  My wife and I typically drop about $100.00 to $150 on sushi a few times a month and eat and drink at least double what we had here, and most importantly we enjoy the quality and presentation else ware.  If you are looking for Quality Sushi visit the MOzen Bistro at the Mandarin Oriental.  If you are looking for good pictures grab a couple drinks here and save your money for something better.  if you are a Seafood Lover I would Highly Recommend AquaKnox in The Venetian Hotel."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a great place to take a date too.    http://www.visitwynn.com/documents/Mizumi.pdf"}
{"text":"Deducting a star because it's so expensive. It made more sense for us to fork over the money for the 6 course tasting menu than for everyone to order single small entrees that would leave us hungry. It was an excellent decision as we indulge every dish. By far the wagyu beef was everyone's favorite. You are paying for the ambiance, quality of food, and service."}
{"text":"Set at the sushi bar. Ordered starter Seaweed salad and sushi. Surprisingly the sushi was prepared in good time ahead of the salad. The sushi tasted great. Unfortunately the salad never arrived so had to cancel. This would be not acceptable for this caliber restaurant, hence my rating."}
{"text":"Really great restaurant. Flavors were delicious and fish was cut well and presented flawlessly. The Kobe on the hot stones was phenomenal. No need for sauces. Explored the mackerel, Uni, and the house roll...all wonderful.  Steve Wynne was actually dining in the restaurant that evening.  About a dozen staff around him, the whole time.  Definite repeat."}
{"text":"We ended up eating here on a Saturday night. there was no wait and we were able to get a table for 8, this should have been our first clue.   Our waiter J Israel provided the worst service I have ever experienced in Las Vegas. He literally did not come to the table once during our meal. We had to call him anytime we wanted anything.   He was arrogant and rude and ruined our experience. Management made no concessions when we complained. The food is reasonable but for the price you would expect better service from a Wynn establishment.  This waiter literally was the worst I have ever seen in Vegas. I hope he has other career plans because if this his life's goal... he is already failing.  I would not return to this restaurant. There are plenty of places in Vegas that will give you a great dining experience for $150 a person."}
{"text":"I ate here last night with a girlfriend.  We almost were going to eat at another sushi place on property but that atmosphere seemed very crowded and not as pretty, so the hostess called Mizumi for us to see if we would be able to eat there instead.  They asked the hostess if we were dressed appropriately, and the hostess stepped out from behind her box to see what bottoms and shoes we were wearing!  That was mortifying because we are both pretty girls, skinny, and were dressed in skirts and crop tops.  Then the hostess had to see if we were staying on property.  Why does that matter??  I live here so why would I be sleeping there?  I felt kind of insulted at all the questions before they would grace me with letting me eat at Mizumi so that is why I gave them three stars.  Once they gave my girlfriend and I the go-ahead to go downstairs to Mizumi everyone inside was super friendly and greeted us.  Literally every person we walked by wished us to have a good time.  Our server was friendly and informative enough, though I did think he should have come by our table more to check on us or see if we needed anything.  I had a Lycheetini made with vodka instead of gin which was excellent and my friend had chardonnay.  We started with some brussel sprouts that were really just the leaves rather then the heads fried in an oil and served with sliced nuts I think.  It was excellent.  We ordered some sushi as well as eggplant robata and Chilean sea bass robata.  I did not like the Chilean sea bass as much as I normally do for some reason.  I think it was cut so small that it lost some of the oily and juicey texture it is revered for to be honest.  We ended the dinner with a chocolate mask which was literally a white kabuki mask decorated to perfection with red lips and black hair served with a scoop of ice cream and some rice-crispy-type-crunchies.  The mask was filled with a mousse.  I'd have given the dinner four stars but my experience getting a reservation there was embarrassing that I brought it down to three stars.  I'm not so full of myself that I am going to be like \"I'm a hot girl so seat me\" but I am a local, I do have money to spend, I am an excellent tipper, so don't give me a hard time getting a reservation.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, but very pricy. Sake selection was excellent and the waiter was helpful in selecting one that my partner and I liked, dry and cold."}
{"text":"Not bad. Decent sushi. The duck bim bi bap was good. Extra half star for having Orion at the bar. View of the waterfall is cool if you're into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Much like the other restaurants at the Wynn and Encore, I am very impressed by the decor and food presentation but underwhelmed by the actual taste of the food. I do believe though, that we pay for the overall experience and not so much the food itself. I always have a great time and feel like an absolute princess at these restaurants. I think that's what helps me give better ratings.   I don't remember which rolls we ordered but they were all good. Nothing special tasting to inspire such prices but the presentation was always so delicate and perfect.   Sashimi was good, same with the beef dish. We also got this warm steamed egg looking thing with black truffle on top. It didn't have much flavor.   So yeah, don't come expecting the best food ever but do come with great company and for the amazing view."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and had a great experience, with the exception of tonight. I was wearing an ankle length skirt and cardigan, but because three inches of my midriff was showing, was told to pull down my sweater or leave. I obviously left.   This is Las Vegas. I can pay $300 for a meal anywhere. My husband and I just arrived at yellowtail at the Bellagio, where we will go from now on.   We wanted a nice meal and to gamble. As locals, Wynn will no longer be our destination of choice."}
{"text":"Came here for a group dinner with girlfriends... food was delicious! Service was a bit slow but we weren't in a rush to go anywhere so it worked to our advantage. I had the bimbimbap and it was utterly delish and also had a french martini (also yummy). I would totally go back.. loved it!"}
{"text":"This place had amazing reviews, so of course I had to check it out.  We had a reservation through Opentable.com which said the dress code was \"business casual.\"  My father was wearing a nice pair of khaki shorts and was told he was not allowed in the dining room.  We were only allowed to sit at the bar.  This is Vegas in September.  It was 100 degrees outside and business casual is a pretty loose definition.  The bar ended up being fine.  In fact, the sushi chef we had was spectacular!  He even made some wonderful recommendations and we had a pleasant conversation with him throughout our meal.  The thing that really bothered everyone in my group was seeing several people being seated wearing hats, including a baseball cap, and several people in ripped jeans going right on in.  The hostess seemed to have no problem picking on my father, but when younger \"trendy\" people came in the door, they were not hassled about their clothing.  This and this alone is why I am not giving 5 stars.  If the food and our sushi chef were not absolutely spectacular, the rating would be even lower for this act of discrimination.  I couldn't help but glare at her as we left.  She should be fired."}
{"text":"This is so gorgeous and the outside area with the waterfall is very impressive.  The servers and the food all excellent.  Ambiance is very important so I was surprised to hear radio type music especially in a Japanese restaurant with such a fabulous presence. My recommendation would be to play appropriate music, it really rounds out the experience.  What I need to be clear about is that when you hear everyday so so music in an exceptional environment it really cuts the experience off at the knees.  Because even for that hour or two that restaurant has the ability to sweep you away to another place."}
{"text":"Wow if the owners here knows how to serve the sushi properly when patrons are sitting in front of the sushi bar, this place would be astounding. First of all, let me set something straight.... Mizumi is situated inside the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas and you'd expect the food to be pricy and.... IT IS! One thing I can say is that this place serves the FRESHEST FISH I EVER ATE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I've been to many great sushi restaurants in NYC but this places fish is top notch, GRADE A like how Colombians like their coke...if you know what im saying lol.   GOOD: Freshest fish I've ever tasted. Pieces are HUGE  BAD: Sushi rice is supposed to be in room temperature but its a bit cold. Flavor of rice could use a ITSY bit more of vinegar. Normally when you sit in front of a sushi bar, the chef serves each sushi piece by piece but not this place.  Also, the chef would brush the mixture of soy sauce onto your sushi prior to serving each piece but not this place....  Overall, i'm giving it a 4 star is because of the quality of the fish and the huge portion that comes with it."}
{"text":"Such a gorgeous and immaculate place. Food was tender and well cooked although it could've used more flavor. Drinks we chose were pretty good and the macaroon dessert was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here for the first time tonight and really enjoyed my meal.  Even though I stay at the Encore/Wynn frequently, I had never been to Mizumi.  I am glad I finally tried it.  Mizumi is a modern Japanese restaurant located right by the lake at the Wynn.  The setting is beautiful - just be sure to sit facing the lake and waterfall to enjoy the best view.  The restaurant has a wide range of Japanese options ranging from sushi and sushimi, to Robatayaki and Teppanyaki.  I focused on sushi and Robatayaki.  I started things off with Robatayaki Jidori chicken, sea bass, and beef tenderloin.  All of the proteins were delicious!  The coals used for cooking lend a unique flavor to the food and each was cooked perfectly.    I then ordered one of their signature rolls based upon my server's recommendation.  The Scallop Tataki and Crispy Shrimp Roll is seared Hokkaido scallops, crunchy shrimp, avocado, onion sprouts, jalapeño, yuzu tobiko, citrus aïoli, and eel sauce.  The texture and flavor were amazing!  Overall, the food was delicious and well prepared.  The setting was excellent and the service was good.  I will definitely be back!  Iced Tea Rating - 4 stars.  Delicious tea with lots of refills.  PS it's the same tea served throughout the Wynn/Encore resorts."}
{"text":"Five stars!  No more service issues! After dining here a few months ago I gave Mizumi four stars because of a few service issues...but after a more recent visit, this restaurant totally deserves that final star!  Everything we ordered was fantastic, and this time, the service matched that level of quality.    If you like oysters, this is the place to order them.  The Chilled Shigoku Oysters appetizer is so good - I don't know that I can even describe how good it truly was.  I think we could have eaten six orders of them.  The Ceviche Roll also really stood out as both unique and delicious - the creamy, cool avocado and the spicy, fresh salsa complimented the fish so well in a way that was totally unexpected - this was definitely my new favorite sushi bar item on the menu.  Mizumi pretty much has it all - beautiful atmosphere, great view, excellent service, and of course amazing food, it's definitely a great place to visit to celebrate a special occasion or really just treat yo' self! :)   Cheers!"}
{"text":"average quality of food, hostess cold has the north pole, service ok, prices dont make sense to what you get, it is a no, no, no...but probably there is not much offer of japanese quality in Vegas, except Yellow tail which was much better when I went this summer"}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab dinner inside the Wynn!  We ordered tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi which were all super delicious and fresh. Our favorite was definitely the yellowtail! The Teppanyaki was also fantastic if you are craving a show+dinner. I loved the Tiger Shrimp and the Angus Beef Tenderloin (medium-rare) and the fried rice that came with the meal. Tip: Ask for extra garlic if you are a garlic-lover. Definitely try the mochi ice cream after your meal which comes with four different flavors for a tasty, refreshing finish.   If you can, try to grab a window seat to enjoy the waterfall outside. Also, I did not come here dressed up in business casual. Casual button up and denim worked for me.  Looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Don't go chasing waterfalls.    I came to Mizumi with the expectation of having a nice dinner with an amazing view.  I didn't make reservations because we saw there was a lot of open seating, but it took 10 minutes to seat us.  We were seated next to the waterfall, which was of course, gorgeous.    Service is what you would expect at the Wynn.  Everyone is very attentive and courteous.  They help you into your seat, set your napkin for you, and treat you like a princess.  If only the food was as good as the service.  The menu is limited.  They offer omakase for $125+, robatayaki, sushi, entrees, and hot plates.  Nothing stood out as \"must try\" items.  So we opted for items from the grill, a sushi roll, and the mizumi mask dessert.    Grill items: Enoki and bacon, tenderloin, and pork belly.  Of the three, the pork belly was the most flavorful, very tender, and filling.  The enoki and bacon and tenderloin skewer were both okay.    Kimchee cucumber sushi roll: It was beautifully presented, the cilantro sauce was delicious!  But the sushi roll itself was a bit lacking.    Mizumi mask dessert: Possibly the redeeming factor of the meal.  The mask is also beautiful, and when you crack it open, a delicious, light mousse lies beneath.  It also comes with vanilla ice cream.  The flavors of chocolate, vanilla, and hazelnut pair nicely with one another and it was probably the best thing we had that night.    If you're looking for that wow factor, definitely come here to impress your date.  But if you're looking for good food, save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"As long as you're not coming to Mizumi expecting to have something you've never had before, you'll be treated to a wonderful experience, and hopefully you'll appreciate the restaurant's effusive service, opulent décor, dark beauty, and solid riffs on modern classic dishes that other restaurants have made famous.  Put another way, if your idea of Japanese culinary creativity is maki rolls stuffed with cream cheese, you'll think Mizumi is either on the bleeding-edge or heretical. If you've dined at Nobu or Zuma before, this is old hat.  On my experience at Mizumi, I started with sushi, specifically the Yellowtail Sashimi and Jalapeño Gelée. Very thinly-sliced yellowtail were dressed with crispy onion, negi, cilantro oil, and ponzu sauce, resulting in intense onion-y, spicy, and sweet flavors, while the oil created a tongue-feel of a lightly-seared piece of bacon, and the onions provided a much-appreciated crunch. Upon tasting this $29 appetizer (which the menu estimates to be 90 calories), I realized that I've had this same exact dish before at Nobu. Mizumi should pay royalties to Chef Matsuhisa for much of their menu.  I then moved on to nigiri: 2 pieces of the Sweet Shrimp nigiri (i.e., spot prawns) from the cold waters of Alaska. The prawns featured a delicate, sweet flavor that almost managed to justify the $16 price tag. I do wish they'd serve them with the deep-fried head as some of Mizumi's uhh... competitors do. My other quibble is with the ultra-stickiness of the sushi rice at Mizumi resulted in grains of rice stubbornly clinging to my fingers as I ate the nigiri. I suspect Mizumi may add starch to their sushi rice in an attempt to make their nigiri chopsticks-friendly to Americans rather than educating the masses that nigiri should never be eaten with chopsticks.  Next up were 2 pieces of the Ch?toro nigiri, weighing in at a \"this better be worth it, or Jay K's gonna shred you on Yelp\" price of $24. As you probably know, Ch?toro is a mixture of akami (meaty tuna) and otoro (fatty tuna belly), making for a well-marbled tasty, sweet, and tender cut of tuna fish. Mizumi's ch?toro is flown in from Spain and has the \"melty\" mouthfeel of a premium piece of otoro, but with more of an actual tuna flavor.  Served with my sushi was a $14 Lobster Miso Soup which contained chunks of lobster, tofu, nameko mushrooms, seaweed, green onions, and mitsuba. I was pleasantly surprised by the considerable amount of lobster in the soup. Lobster and butter will always be everyone's favorite classic pairing, but the complementary nature of miso and lobster should not be underestimated -- I'd choose Mizumi's lobster miso soup over most lobster bisques I've had.  The Whole-Grilled Bone Marrow ($20) may have been the highlight of my dinner at Mizumi. Glazed with a sweet yakitori sauce, I expected the bone marrow to have a smokiness one would associate with yakitori, but it did not, and that was alright. It was sweet, rich, sticky, and satisfying, pairing well with the brioche croutons. It was sweet enough that it could be eaten for dessert.  After I slurped down my bone marrow, my entrée arrived, the Baked Sweet Miso Marinated Black Cod ($38), listed on the menu as containing only 430 calories. This is the dish that made Nobu famous. Mizumi's preparation is a little bit cleaner in that it is not served with the reduced miso sauce marinade that Nobu's black cod is glazed with. Instead, a variety of different sweet pickles are served aside the fish. This allows the eater to exert more control over how sweet each bite is. I would rate the Mizumi rendition of miso-marinated black cod to be about on par with Nobu's and Zuma's version.  All said, Mizumi delivered a fine meal from a high-end restaurant located in one of Las Vegas's premier casino resort hotels, pretty much on par with what I expected. Although my meal rarely thrilled, at no point did it disappoint.  Food/Décor/Service: 4.4/4.3/4.4"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Portions were decent. Show was same a any Benihana. View was fantastic. Pricey for food but it's Vegas"}
{"text":"Beautiful space, service is 'over the top attentive.'  Sushi was okay, not the best I've ever had, it was slightly above-average.  Ditto for the tempura.  The brussels sprouts appetizer was amazing.  My husband loved all of his food.  We would return, the space is just amazing and the service was so prompt and friendly.  I'd definitely give another chance, but would probably not order sushi or would order different types.  To clarify, the fish wasn't bad, it was just too much sweet, sticky rice or it just lacked in taste."}
{"text":"Absolutely gorgeous knockout decor!  Stunning!  Although the place is heavily decorated in red with white, it was quite elegant.  Don't be intimidated to eat alone here.  If you're a guest and you're hungry, go for it.  I sat by the window next to the waterfall with the view of the Palazzo next door.  Instead of having sushi, I had their best deal in the house - a Robataki and sashimi on the side.  My dessert was a work of art and delicious too."}
{"text":"Great food and nice room.  If CAD was a bit stronger I would also say good value but at 1.40,it's a bit pricey for Canadians especially if you're from Vancouver where we're spoiled with an abundance of great Japanese restaurants"}
{"text":"Just an average sushi restaurant. No roll really stood out. A lack of mid range white wines. Service was strong. Great ambience.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We decided for a light dinner after having a big lunch earlier. Our server was Anthony, who is a veteran at this restaurant. In fact, we remembered that he had served us about six years ago when the restaurant was under a different name.   The service...Anthony is warm, friendly, attentive, offers great recommendations on dishes. He was super attentive through our meal. I am not exaggerating, he stopped at our table at least ten times. Thank you Anthony!   We started with the yellowtail sashimi. It was such a balanced, fresh, crisp and well flavored dish. It was our favorite of the night despite having several other impeccable dishes.   We then had the sea bass and shishito pepper skewers. Both were good, but they weren't the best I have had.   We then had the bone marrow. I typically get bone marrow at steak houses as an add-on to steaks, or to burgers, or as a dish at American or Italian restaurants. To get it at a Japanese restaurant was unique in and of itself because the flavors were different than what I'm accustomed to having. There was a very delicious sauce across the top of the marrow, and it was served with crostinis.   Next, we had the 72 hour wagyu with gnocchi and a parsnip purée. Again, the flavors were impeccable, the meat was melt in your mouth good!!   We were on the fence about dessert and asked if there was something we just had to try. So we were told to try to Mizumi mask. I posted a picture of it, so please check it out! It was truly a work of art! The top was a mask made of chocolate that was hand painted individually. You crack it open with your spoon to find chocolate mouse sitting on a texturally crunchy bite. It was arguably the best dessert we have had (when factoring presentation along with taste and creativity).   All in all, we will definitely be back. I wish we hadn't had as big of a lunch so we could have had an appetite for more dishes. We may be back again on our trip...!"}
{"text":"What can I say but Wow! Dine outside near the waterfall for an experience you'll never forget. Lobster miso, pineapple parfait and yellowtail jalapeño gelee are musts!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to stick close to The Wynn so we chose Mizumi for dinner.  Very elegant restaurant with a cool atmosphere.  The food was OK - nothing to write home about.  Wouldn't say avoid it but wouldn't say it's a must-try either."}
{"text":"During my birthday vacation in Vegas, I was in search of a good restaurant with vegan options for my birthday dinner.  One of my vegan friends told me that Mizumi at Wynn was incredible so I went with her suggestion and I'm so happy I did.  It was definitely a night to remember!   As I walked into the restaurant, I was amazed at the beautiful decor.  We were seated at a table with a view of the breathtaking outdoor lit up waterfall.  It was such a gorgeous setting for dinner.    As far as the vegan options, the back page of the menu listed the items that we could choose from.  The only minor issue we had was that we tried to order vegetable tempura and asked if it had egg and the server explained that it can't be made vegan.  I was a bit surprised that they could not make vegetable tempura with no egg as I've had it before at other vegan Japanese places.  But oh well, everything else we ordered made up for the minor issue.  My BF and I decided to share everything and we ordered vegetarian miso soup, organic tofu and shinseki pear salad, vegetable roll, ishiyaki bi bim bop, organic agedashi tofu, farmer's vegetables, and organic eryngii mushrooms.  Everything was excellent and I could really taste the quality in the food.  The rice in the vegetable sushi roll was perfectly prepared and none like I've had in any sushi place,  My BF and I could not stop saying \"mmm, mmm, wow.\"  We were both in heaven as we tried every dish.  My favorite dish was the organic tofu and shiseki pear salad which had romaine lettuce, shiso, carrots, seaweed, kukui nuts and yuzu-ginger vinaigrette - very fresh tasting and I loved the flavors.  For dessert, we had the vegan organic shiseki pear tart and the lychee sorbet - both also delicious.  They even brought out a candle and Happy Birthday written on a piece of dark chocolate on the sorbet just for me.    As far as the service, it was top notch!  All the food was brought out in perfect order - miso soup and sushi first, then salad, then bigger plates.  We never had to wait long for our food.  The servers were very attentive and they even refolded your napkin when you got up to use the restroom.    Beautiful ambiance, incredible food and superb service.  Definitely a memorable birthday dinner! I would love to come back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just loved this restaurant - top notch Japanese, gorgeous dining room with view of gorgeous zen garden and waterfall, and terrific service.  We tried a variety of dishes, with our favorite being the robatayaki (great recommendation from our server).  We tried several robatayaki items - wagyu short rib, onions, sweet potato, cod - all awesome!  We also had yellowtail sashimi, a beautiful cucumber and seaweed salad, and lobster beignets.  The desserts topped a fantastic meal off - the chocolate candy bar confection and mango sorbet  The service was outstanding and contributed to a memorable evening.    I highly recommend asking to be seated in front of the window that looks out on the waterfall and garden - just makes the whole meal even better!  Best to be second row from window so you get the full view."}
{"text":"Our flight into Las Vegas we delayed by three hours so we arrived at 9pm and scrambled for a place to eat.  Since we were staying at the Wynn, the front desk suggested Mizumi. My husband and I ate at Mizumi on 8/14/15 and just loved it!  We chose the tasting menu with the wine/sake pairing and both were amazing!  The sommelier was nice to write up all the wine/sake we drank.  I just wish we had a write up of what we ate.  The fish was amazingly fresh, the wine/sake were unique and nicely paired to each course and the service was fantastic.  We sat outside near the fountain. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was great but horrible service. Waited 30 minutes for our table on a 9:30 reservation. Then the food took forever and the waitress was snotty. As if they could be bothered."}
{"text":"Mizumi, like every part of the Wynn, is amazing. The staff are pleasant, helpful and truly do everything they can to make your meal a delight. But the main treat is obviously the food. Each dish was beautifully made and fresh with flavor. Dori and I are vegan and once they were told, they arrange the tasting menu special with vegan options. A perfect meal and evening. And a must visit while in town, vegan or not."}
{"text":"Good service, nice environment, great drinks. But the nigiri...oh no...too much rice for a proper nigiri. We ordered snapper, engawa, sea urchin, sea scallops. Fresh ingredients? yes. But it's NOT worth the top buck or the title as a \"best sushi\" on the strip. Too much rice, overcome the seafood's flavor. I've had a lot of good sushi places that can beat this restaurant in pieces. Vegan options? Yes, they tried. If you are a real sushi lover, please, go somewhere else to fulfill your dreams."}
{"text":"Gorgeous place. Super sweet service staff. I got take out which was decent but not great. Spicy tuna rolls were pretty good . Seaweed salad was awful. Brussels sprouts were beyond too greasy. Small takeout dinner for one was about $50."}
{"text":"Very good Japanese option at the Wynn  My wife and I were staying at the Wynn and were overwhelmed by the dining options.  However, Mizumi seemed like a great option for both of us.  Located off the lobby of the Wynn, Mizumi is beautifully decorated and overlooking a gorgeous waterfall (man-made).    The udon noodles with shitake mushrooms was quite good and a nice way to start the meal.  My wife had the duck confit bibimbap and enjoyed it although she found the gochujang (chili paste) to be too spicy.  I had a selection of sashimi that was very good.  My wife raved about the sour cherry shaved ice.  I had some very good ice cream to cap off the meal.  Overall, Mizumi at the Wynn was quite good offering a range of sushi, robatayaki, and teppanyaki dishes.  If you are staying at the Wynn and are looking for Japanese, this is your best option."}
{"text":"I just had an amazing dinner today at Mizumi! We ordered Lobster and beef teppan. The teppan was amazing and delicious! The chef was nice and he showed some show for us as well haha It is expensive but it's worth it. Defenitely be back when I come back to vegas again."}
{"text":"A nice Japanese place at the Wynn.  Good overall.  I like the sushi and tempura the most.  Overall this is a 4 out of 5 place."}
{"text":"Fine Dinning...  The services was excellent, they were assertive when we let them know someone at our table was allergic to shrimp. Even the chef came out to let him know what he was able to eat and what to avoid.  The food was good the sushi/raw fish was fresh and the atmosphere was very nice. Everything comes in small serving. (That's how Japanese culture is tho) So don't be alarmed... for the price to the food... It's a good experience and environment.  I've been here yrs ago with my girlfriend and it a little bit different but none the less good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stay at the Wynn/Encore twice a year and had yet tried Mizumi for dinner.  We were in the mood for Teppanyaki (table cooking/hibachi) and Mizumi fit the bill!  This place is gorgeous just like every other facet of the Wynn properties. The food was fresh and the chef put on a great show in front of us cooking our food. I had steak and my husband had a steak and shrimp combination.   Dessert is also included and it was this amazing tropical citrus cake. Unlike anything else I've tasted. Super tart and unusual but I liked it!"}
{"text":"The Concierge of Wynn recommended me this restaurant to celebrate my birthday. I asked for something unusual and impressive. I got what i asked. Mizumi is a beautiful restaurant which is designed with a great taste like everything in Wynn. Service is good. Prices are high but it depends on your appetite and what you are ordering. Cocktails are incredible. Sushi rolls are good. Sea bass and beef skewers are amazing. Desserts.. I am a very sweet tooth person and usually expect the best of the best but i was a little bit disappointed. Desserts were unique and beautifully presented that's for sure and photos can not lie but the taste was average ( my parents liked it though very much). Anyway it is the best place to some special occasions. It's just beautiful authentic place. Can't wait to come back for rolls and cocktails next year!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!! I had the Black Cod and a cucumber salad. I am still thinking about how yummy it was weeks ago. Great service too!"}
{"text":"miso soup yes hands down the sushi I have had better..and price is way to high for what u get"}
{"text":"Gorgeous setting for dinner. We made reservations for the teppenyaki table in the back. There were a few other couples at another table, but we were sat off on our own with a great view of the water features! They were just finishing up too, so we ended up having the whole room to ourselves by the end of our salad course!  Note, it is a LOT of food. Patti had the chicken, and it was 2 huge breasts they chopped up on the hot table. Crazy amount of scallops too. They could serve half and you would still be STUFFED.  Great table show from the chef. Wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience, exquisite food, great service!  This was a wonderful experience.  We had the octopus and seaweed salad, a few sushi rolls, a stunning sashimi platter, and their signature Mizumi mask dessert, which I highly recommend if you are a fan of chocolate.  A must for those who enjoy Japanese cuisine and want to treat themselves to a special evening in Vegas."}
{"text":"Below subpar sushi! My hubby and I travel to Vegas at least 8 times a year for business, it's like our second home. We like good food and good drinks. Someone recommended we eat here. We ate here with our business partner and his wife. The sushi was REALLY expensive and NOT good. We get better, more flavorful, fresher sushi at the dive sushi place up the street by our house in Southern Cal. We ordered stuff that literally had no flavor. I actually stopped eating b/c it was so bad and didn't want to waste my calories on crappy food. The only good thing I had was my lemon drop martini made exactly the way I like it. Our server Kimberly was also friendly and knowledgeable. So any way, we had below sub par sushi, it was actually GROSS and a bill that was over $500 for 4 people! BAD! Unbelievable! Way too over priced, not good. Do not recommend. There are MUCH better sushi places in Vegas (Kumi at Mandalay Bay) trust me!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is. Sushi was just OK. Nothing mind-blowing happened here. In fact, one $40 roll, of surf and turf, was just not right. Something about it being both hot and cold, and turning it all just warm- not a good taste for sushi.  Decor and ambiance was excellent and the wine list was excellent. Our service was good, but not very attentive.  Overall, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This is super fancy pants Vegas dining, and what you'd expect from the Wynn. It's an absolutely beautiful, dramatic space, lavishly decorated and the tables near the waterfall view would be perfect for a date.   We ordered several dishes for the table, but nothing knocked my socks off. A friend and I are on a budget so we got a few Philadelphia rolls (don't judge) and at the price, the amount of salmon was pretty sad and it wasn't the best I've ever had. Nothing was the best I've had, especially for the price, and we ordered several robata plates as well as specialty rolls.   The servers weren't very nice to us, even with as much as we were ordering, and I thought it was strange that there was no music playing at all. The restaurant was mostly empty and very, very quiet and dead. A few friends and I left to grab sandwiches at the café because we were still hungry and didn't want to drop another $15 on mostly rice.   I've never been very impressed with high-end Vegas sushi restaurants. This restaurant is gorgeous, I'll give it that, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night with my boyfriend. The food was very fresh and flavorful but also very pricey. The staff was all very helpful and constantly checking on us. I would probably only come back for a special occasion if anything. Also loved the view of the waterfall outside"}
{"text":"Nice Japanese restaurant in Wynn probably best one in LV. The waterfall is unique while the private room would be a better choice if you prefer quiet place. Food there just delicious and better than expected."}
{"text":"If you like a nice ambiance and fresh sushi, you won't be wrong to pick Mizumi for a nice dinner date. Very stylish and new as expected at Wynn/Encore. We ordered one of the Omakase specials for two and we weren't disappointed. Try to get a seat by the waterfall, really nice view!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and each time has been superb. The setting is beautiful and dramatic, the wine and cocktail selection is fantastic, the service is above and beyond, and the food is ... are there even words? I'm a vegetarian and there is a huge selection of items, not to mention they are incredibly conscientious of allergies or any dietary concerns. Even though it's on the pricy side, I will keep coming back. There is nowhere like Mizumi."}
{"text":"I cant say enough nice things about this place. I had a reservation for 4. We called ahead to let them know we were running late. They made everything perfect upon our arrival.  The service gave us enough time to order. Appatizers came out quickly. The food was excellent.  The atmosphere was amazing. The lighting was dem and look out onto a waterfall. Dessert was eye catching and delicious.  From the moment we entered till we left was an amazing experience. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. We ordered the sushi platter and the sushi was amazing. It was a little pricy though but again it's inside the Wynn casino so anything on the strip is consider expensive. we also ordered their Drunken Noodles as that was also good."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas alone for Valentine's Day week for a work meeting and I decided to try the sushi restaurant for dinner. I didn't think I would be able to get a last minute reservation because it also happened to be Chinese New Year and everything was booked that weekend. However, I was able to get in and sat at the sushi bar.  Service was very good. My server was attentive, he helped me make some final decisions that were great and talked me into a great dessert. Oops, I forgot I gave up sweets for Lent. Service was also quick as I was going to see Show Stoppers afterward, I got in, ate and made my show on time.  The food was very good. The sushi was fresh, it was well prepared, had great flavor, and the presentation was pretty.  Ambiance, the restaurant is stunning. The waterfall, the beautiful decor, you name it. The sushi chefs were great and watching is always amazing.  Price, it was a little pricey, but I think that it was on par for a hotel restaurant in Las Vegas. I had edamame, 1 roll, 1 glass of wine, and dessert for over $100."}
{"text":"You definitely are paying for the Chef show here.  Once in a while is cool, but the food is bland here.  I cook, I know what it looks like to cook.  LOL, I guess it's great to see that the chef doesn't sneeze or spit in your food. =/   It's totally not worth eating here every single time we're in Las Vegas, because there are soooooo much better restaurants out there that we haven't even tried yet.  There is a place like this in Mission Viejo and the Chefs there are super talented.  They would even try to shoot a ball of fried rice in your mouth.  I never seen them miss unless the guest didn't open wide.  Now that is a show!"}
{"text":"Great Teppanyaki and sushi restaurant inside Wynn. It is super pricey but great food. I had the steak sirloin with scallops combo and it was great - $90. The seared Foi Gras was ok, it was seated at the Teppan grill, but that was it. I expected a little bit more - like a sauce or something.  They had an Amuse Bouche - a mushroom Croquette. It was a nice compliment before the meal. The shrimp tempura roll was ok as well. Nothing special. Overall - it was a $300 meal for 2 which would have cost $120 at Benihana. They charge a $50 corkage fee but beware, if they carry the wine, they would not open your bottle."}
{"text":"The actual restaurant very classy looking. The decor and ambiance we're perfect. The quality of the food for the price you pay we felt it could have been a bit better. Also the service could have been better. If you have never been I think worth trying once but that's it. Not a repeat location"}
{"text":"Good but definitely not the best I've experienced. You're paying premium prices for ambiance and its location at Wynn. While food is decent, nothing special as I've had at some other sushi restaurants around the country, it is extremely overpriced. Small lobster roll $40, 2 pieces of toro nigiri $40? Just unreasonable. Service definitely needs to match the prices. Not friendly, no enthusiasm, slow."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to go here on Christmas Day since it was the only place with a reasonable wait time. The area is spacious and beautiful inside and we were seated at the bar area. The brussel sprouts were delicious, crispy, coated with almonds and balsamic vinegar. The rainbow roll was fairly standard, nothing particular amazing or unique about it. The hot pot we ordered was a bit disappointing though, we were expecting a larger amount for $40 and alas, we were only presented with a small bowl. Other than that, the service was great, but we left a bit hungry."}
{"text":"We ate a light dinner at the bar at Mizumi. The ambiance is cool. I like the color scheme, the waterfall backdrop, all the decor.   Having been to a few comparably priced $$$$ sushi restaurants, my expectations where high. We shared seared ahi, the black cod and a spicy tuna roll. Everything was good. But nothing was fantastic. I was surprised and disappointed."}
{"text":"Four stars for experience.  Three stars for the food.  Five stars for being very accommodating to my gluten issues.  We were a group of six and sat at one of the teppanyaki tables.  Ordered a bunch of sushi and edamame to start.  The fish was good, especially the maguro, but it wasn't mind blowing.    Then we had the teppanyaki.  The show was fine (about as good as a Benihana show) and the food was above average (I had the sirloin and opakapaka (fish of the day)).  The sheer volume of food was off the charts.  It just kept coming and coming and coming.  The mochi ice cream dessert was spectacular. The mochi was nice and warm and the fruity ice creams went very well with it.  Overall, it's a nice place for a big group."}
{"text":"It's too bad that their full menu doesn't seem to be on their website, because I'll have to try and remember everything that our party ordered this past weekend.  Everything was so delicious, and probably twice as delicious sitting in such a beautiful restaurant.  It's too bad that we came on a cold evening, because I think they usually open up the glass doors to the waterfall.  Next time we come, and there will definitely be a next time, I'm aiming for one of their patio tables right next to the waterfall!  Let's see if I can recall everything that was served.  One of our friends pretty much ordered everything for our group...  Abalone Sashimi: This was the one item that was a must-have for me.  I've never tried raw abalone, and I was stoked that they carried it.  The texture was so new to me -- it was crunchy!  Small portion but worth the new experience.  Yellowtail Sashimi w/ jalapeño gelée, crispy onion, micro cilantro, ponzu, nori cracker:  This dish was divine; we had to order two.  The yellowtail was SO fresh and each component of the dish was a burst of flavor that complimented the protein well.  Fried Shrimp w/ brussel sprouts: Tasty dish, though not my top choice as I'm not a the biggest fan of fried seafood.  At least it wasn't a heavy batter.  Mizumi Roll & Scallop Tataki Rolls: I usually don't order rolls at high-end Japanese restaurant, though these were tasty and decadent, and great to share in a larger group.  Trio of Tartare: This was a special menu item, consisting of tuna, salmon, and kanpachi.  Each tartare was incredibly flavorful and fresh.  Squid Ink Risotto: I've had squid ink sushi before, but it wasn't this fresh.  Great choice, especially if you're feeling adventurous.  Other items we ordered (that I can remember) were seabass skewers and a miso-glazed seabass.  The seabass skewers were like butter.  Unfortunately, I was too full to try to miso-glazed seabass.  Desserts were presented beautifully, but again, I had no room that those, either.  This is such a fun place to dine in Vegas.  They have a room in the back for Robatayaki, as well as a sushi bar, but I definitely have my eye on the patio for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Great ambience, tasty food and wonderful service. Expensive but worth it. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"If you come from LA and are familiar with sushi that doesn't taste like trash, I recommend you go somewhere else. The rice is dry, the spicy tuna on whatever-the-hell-crispy-cereal also tastes like trash. Basically, everything is toxic. The fish contains a high mercury."}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience. Astonishing ambiance, overlooking the Japanese waterfall and water feature. Cuisine was varied, and immense with flavor and diversity. Have the Kama. Try as much of the Tepanyaki menu as possible.  Just a wonderful night, and the absolute best part was their selection of Japanese single malt. They had Nikka Taketsuro 17, no longer available in the states, and I almost fell to the floor in delight, when I was brought the 21 yo Taketsuro, which you would have to travel to Japan to enjoy. I'll be back for an Encore,  Mr. Wynn! Bravo!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Japanese restaurant.  The restaurant is beautiful, the service was impeccable, and the food was amazing!  The waiter made some wonderful recommendations and everyone really enjoyed their meals (especially the vegan).  Highly recommend if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"We came to this place, expecting amazing sushi.  I mean, we're in Vegas, the food is expensive and the atmosphere is pretty nice. this must be so damn good sushi right?  Well the service here was great.  The atmosphere was romantic and a very great view.  But truth be told the sushi wasn't any better than sushi we've had at other places.  Even the barbecue chicken wasn't spicy and not very flavorful.  I think all this place had was the name but no substance.  I wouldn't recommend anyone going there.  I'd recommend finding an off-strip restaurant with lower prices for the same quality."}
{"text":"This is a \"must\" for anyone that loves Japanese food! There are meals and then there are what I refer to as \"food experiences\" and, this was an experience I will remember forever!! The sashimi had the consistency of butter, oysters were delicious and the Kobe beef was amazing however, for me, the black cod was out of this world!! Oh, and my cucumber martini, wow! Honestly, I'm over 50 years old and I've eaten in many good restaurants but this is one of less than five that I will always remember. The service was also impeccable!! Yes, it's quite expensive but, absolutely worth it. Do not pass up an opportunity to dine here!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! The rest of the menu is a little hard to figure out - the side are mixed in with entree size portions. We had to ask a lot of questions to figure out the menu, but the waitstaff was very knowledgeable and helpful. Sushi was fabulous! Crispy brussels sprouts were unique and delicious. Wagyu shirt ribs were quite good but a small portion. Desert was also good, especially the pomegranate shaved ice."}
{"text":"Never ever eat here. They are most obnoxious hostesses on the planet.  Our 9 year olds pants were not long enough so they would not seat us, never mind that my 12 year daughter had shorts.., so sexiest.  Nice shirt and shoes do not see to good enough though this is not called out anywhere when making reservations.  What a silly stupid and sexiest place.  Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment  We stayed at the encore for the weekend with our company and got a table for a large group  Food was c minus quality and service was even worse Server with attitude and dishes came in random order Overpriced and not recommended  Definitely last visit for us"}
{"text":"Take my word for it... this is the best restaurant in Vegas. Chef Hashimoto is putting out perfection on a plate. He sources his ingredients throughout the west coast and Japan. Order the Omakase dinner and stay opened minded to trying new and interesting combinations. The ambiance is phenomenal with views of the waterfalls. Don't look at the prices. Just assume $250 a head and enjoy the damn experience!"}
{"text":"This is place has great service.  Delicious fresh premium sushi/nigiri.  Awesome vibe too.  Over priced but worth it."}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Good service. Kind of expensive. Drinks were good."}
{"text":"We normally stay at Encore and while we didn't on our last trip, we made an evening of it at the Wynn because we had Le Reve tickets. Had pre-show drinks at Parasol Down, which was an awesome experience as always, and then went to Mizumi for an after-show snack of sorts. We always wanted to try Mizumi, but was leery because I've been disappointed by so many high-end restaurants in LA where you pay for the view/ambience/reputation but not so much for the food. I'm looking at you, Scarpetta.   On to the food... we ordered the robata platter, the Alaskan king crab, pork belly, chicken wings and one other thing which escapes me at the moment. Also ordered a drink... something Ninja. The drink was good, but not a good accompaniment for the meal.  The robata platter...Holy moly. I don't normally care for sea bass nor beef tenderloin, but both were amazing! And the rest of the robata platter was excellent. The husband, who never eats shishito peppers and doesn't really care for mushrooms not only ate them both, he raved about them. And the king crab.. how wrong can you go with king crab cooked in a butter sauce? Although I do have to say that for $35, I'm not sure if I'll order it again, as it wasn't even a full leg. It was a piece about....4-5 inches long. Yes, the crab and the mushrooms that accompanied it were very yummy, but not $35 worth of yummy.  The pork belly... oh, the pork belly. It was more Chinese-style than I expected, as I tasted star anise, which I do not like at all. But it didn't stop me from eating it, much to the husband's chagrin. Definitely ordering at least 2 orders of this the next time. Oh, a woman seated at the next next table ordered the udon and she seemed to really enjoy it so that is on our list as well.  We had great seats, and our waiter was great. Wish we could remember his name, but he was funny, knowledgeable and very efficient. Service all around was worthy of a fine dining establishment. Will definitely be eating here again on our next visit.  The final bill, including a ~20% tip, came to $150. Yes, pricy for an evening snack of sorts, but worth every penny. I won't dock a star because of the price, because apart from the king crab leg, every bite was oh-so-worth the price. And combined with the ambiance, the view and the service, Mizumi is worth it."}
{"text":"good food, tasty seafood pasta, best CA roll I've ever had, flavorful lobster miso soup, unique 5 spice ice cream dessert topped with pear, but very overpriced."}
{"text":"We did the omokase menu and such a great time.  Maybe it was because we had a great view of the waterfall.  Maybe it was our terrific waiter who explained each item and how it was prepared.  Maybe it was the items in that day's menu--whatever it was, we enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever. Period. Look no further. Heather is incredible. Aaron is top notch. Great portion size. I love it here.  :)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Every piece of fish literally melts in your mouth. Its definitely worth the price. And if possible sit by the waterfall!"}

No doubt one of the best rooms in Las Vegas, a waterfall view in the main room sure to wow both tourists and locals alike, it was just after the restaurant's 5:30 opening that all were seated in plush chairs gathered around a spacious marble four-top, the menu presented and perused as forgivingly light EDM pulsed overhead.  Greeted by the Chef who graciously agreed to cook for the table it was with hot green tea charged at $15 with unlimited refills that the evening commenced, one member of the table instead opting for a modestly priced sake that reportedly proved to be a bargain given the quality as a lightly battered scallop crowned in briny caviar spoke to high quality sourcing and plating intended to impress.  Served in five courses in a time-span just over two hours and a half, the first round saw the kitchen focus on raw presentations including a half-dozen oysters enlivened by fresh wasabi alongside strips of paper-thin beef as well as an ambitious tofu salad, each bite of the later showing a complex interplay of textures as well as flavors while melt-in-your-mouth Angus found balance in ponzu and cabbage aged to ferment.  Requesting the kitchen 'go easy' on sushi, but clearly ignoring such constraints when allowed to offer at their whim, course two saw Devin send out a large sampling of items flown in daily, the tender toro taken from just below the collar perhaps the best piece of tuna to ever grace my palate while the clam and its warmed extras were nearly as thrilling and tender, the snappy pink snapper another memorable bite.  Onward to warm items, all three menu mainstays with slight variance in the accoutrements depending on what is most fresh, suffice it to say that $40 for a small pot of egg custard seems expensive no matter how exotic the ingredients while both the unctuous duck liver and lightly grilled octopus competed to steal the spotlight from one another, the autumnal notes of the former no less lovely despite the warm weather while the bitter grapefruit gracing the latter dazzled in juxtaposition to fennel and garlic fried crisp.  Light on the stomach, as Japanese cuisine often seems to trend, a hot-pot was presented as the night's final savory, the admixture of seabass and shellfish all cooked to a semi-firm texture above still-burning flames as the mushrooms, vegetables, and springy noodles all lent textural variance to a broth that was crystal clear but umami rich.  Truly a restaurant worthy its accolades, though the pre-tip bill trumped $350 even with few items offered as gifts, it was with Devin standing tableside discussing Las Vegas dining in general that the meal would end, a trio of molecular-influenced 'sundaes' each memorable in their own way while an additional request for cubed honey-toast riffing on a parfait or bread pudding was absolutely outstanding beneath fresh peach jam and brown butter ice cream, the \"Mizumi Chocolate Mask\" a destination sort of signature as beautiful as it was enjoyable to eat."}
{"text":"This is a great place to celebrate a birthday, engagement, anniversary, the sun rising, the sun  setting...you name it. Rarely do my girlfriends and I dine at any restaurant twice in Vegas, because there are just SO many dining options. Mizumi is the exception!  We ordered a bunch of sushi rolls, beef entrees, vegan entrees, four desserts, bottled water and hot tea. I don't drink alcohol, but the bill came to over $350 for the three of us. If you don't want to shell out that kind of money, then at least try the Geisha mask dessert. It is life changing.  Will we do it again?  Absolutely, because not only were we paying for the food, but also the ambiance and the impeccable service."}
{"text":"I was running out of ideas as to where to celebrate my birthday since I celebrate for a month so, I reached out to fellow Yelpers and Amanda suggested Mizumi. A table was reserved and off to dinner with the family we went. Tables for two had the best view of the waterfall but we were right behind them so we still had an unobstructed view. Perfect for date night.  My favorite things include: truffles, pork belly, duck, Nutella, sushi, lobster, steak, bacon and mushrooms. Pretty much everything on their menu had my favorite things which made deciding difficult but yet enjoyable for me. My sister got the Ishiyaki Duck Confit Bibimbap - great crisp duck pieces with egg, veggies and the usual Bibimbap toppings. Great dish with a bit of a kick. My bro-in-law got the Baked Sweet Miso-Marinated Black Cod - came with lotus chips. It was alright.   I got: The Dream - champagne, elderflower liqueur with preserved hibiscus. A sweet fruity drink.  Lobster Beignets - small soft fried doughnuts filled with lobster. Reminds me of takoyaki and I love takoyaki. 5/5  Mizumi Roll - lobster, tamago, avocado, yuzu mustard aioli, soy paper topped with wasabi tobiko. Very beautifully plated with the lobster head and Yamamomo peach. A good roll. 4/5  Pork Belly - grilled perfectly. Comes with spicy pickled veggies. It has a Korean taste. 5/5  Bacon-Wrapped Enoki Mushrooms - two of my favorite things combined! Enough said! 5/5  Wagyu Short Rib - skewered with potatoes and topped with wasabi horseradish cream. Great flavor. 5/5  Yellow Corn with Black Truffle Butter - 2 pcs grilled corn on the cob with a generous dollop of black truffle butter. Watch the butter melt...oh my! 5/5  Bacon-Wrapped Asparagus - vegetable (tightly wrapped with bacon) makes me think I'm eating \"healthier\". 5/5  Our server, Bojana did a fantastic job. She called me by first name, was very sweet and attentive.  I got a complimentary birthday mochi in green tea, mango, vanilla and red bean.  But I can't leave here without trying their other desserts.  Coconut-Mango - coconut mousse, angel food cake and mango passion fruit sorbet. I'm a fan of mango but not coconut so rating this dessert would be unfair.  Mizumi Chocolate Mask -  White chocolate mask, HAZELNUT dacquiose,  CHOCOLATE mousse, praline puffed rice and vanilla ice cream on the side. OMG! One of the best desserts I've ever had.  Definitely the highlight of my evening. Break the creepy-looking white chocolate mask shell with a knife to reveal the chocolatey hazelnutty goodness of this dessert. So creamy but not overwhelmingly rich. The puffed rice adds texture.  I cleaned my plate and the only thing  didn't eat was the white chocolate base that was holding the mask - only because I'm not a fan of white chocolate. Without a doubt...5/5"}
{"text":"Always top choice for my Japanese cuisine. Good for business dinner, celebrity special event. Raw fish is fantastic."}
{"text":"I choose Mizumi on a whim for our last meal and was exceedingly pleased from the moment we walked in, to finishing dessert. It's a little on the pricer side but luckily most of the appetizers and smaller plates can be shared by two people. I had requested special seating prior and we had been treated to a full view of the waterfalls for dinner. Everyone from the hostess to the waiter, to the servers were completely on top of it all. My tea/water was always full, napkins were picked up from the chair or table and neatly folded back for you. Now onto the food. This is probably one of the best Japanese fusion restaurants a little off the strip as you're going to get! Get the chef's omakase. It's big enough for two people, the slices are large and buttery! If you're really feeling like a baller then get the sashimi pieces. Mizumi made for a very elegant and memorable dinner."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Monday night without a reservation. My fiancé and I were staying as guests at the hotel. They told us there would be a short wait so we sat down at the bar and had the \"Curiosity\" 3 part sake shots were delicious. They took us to our table and we shared shrimp/veggie tempura with a few different sushi rolls with a small bottle of hot sake. All delicious. The service was good. The ambiance was amazing. The view of the waterfall makes for a great date spot, but the restaurant is to bright for if you really wanna get snuggly. They took my coat check back when I sat down and returned it to me as I left. No complaints."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place I've ever been to. Good portion is just right and the staff was amazing. Hands down, the best service I've experienced during my stay here in Vegas (my first time being here). Stacy was our server and was AMAZING! She was super helpful and very patient. The restaurant itself is beautiful and has this amazing view of a man made waterfall. I will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I don't always blow my car payment on eating out. But when I do, this place is worth it.  Amazing ambiance, impeccable service and exquisite dining. A 5-Star experience all around that we'll remember always."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Their decor is beautiful and the view of the waterfall is breathtaking. The service is great. Our server was Tom and he was really funny and approachable. He came regularly to check up on us and the bussers were very attentive. They literally refilled our drinks even before we asked them to. The food is good. I was told that you can tell if a sushi restaurant is good by their spicy tuna and Mizumi's is pretty good. And I hate it when they use fake wasabi so I was pretty pleased to see that they used the real kind.   -Lychee Cocktail (not the sake one) smells incredibly and I was scared that it might be too sweet, but nope. Its good.  -Sushi plate has a great variety of sushi if you want to try different kinds. They brought me a oh-toro (the fat delicious, melt-in-your-mouth goodness)! So kind of them bc normally bring out the chu toro -King crab handroll. Now this, I highly recommend. YUMMMMM. Im getting HANGRY!  -Scallop roll? I forgot the name :/ But I also recommend this. It is so fresh and delicious and you get a nice surprise crunch. The textures made this fun to eat.  -Spicy tuna is worth trying  -Honey ice cream bread thing? I forgot the proper name for this too:/ but if u take a look at the menu, youll know what im talking about. This is a bit too sweet and honey-y for me.   Def worth a try!! It is next to the Wynn registration desk."}
{"text":"Wow such fresh sushi. The waterfall in the outdoor seating is gorgeous. The sushi is clean and amazing. Great Service and Great taste. love it here.   Reservations are super easy to make online, you can call in our even have the concierge make it for you.   Service is wow. I felt like freaking royalty in here! I feel like all restaurants should have service like this I felt like I was the only customer in the restaurant who mattered and I'm sure every table felt that way.   The rolls are so clean so fresh it's like the went fishing right then and there. Yummers I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is super cool everyone should experience it at least once. Great Decor, friendly people, the food is delicious. Go pay a little more but in the big picture you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"It was our anniversary & they gave us the perfect table! Food & drinks were impeccable! We asked the waiter his recommendations, he was spot on! We'll most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If course the food was great and it better be for how much money they charge. Be prepared for a $100 per person on the low end. So because of how outrageous the price is I have to take off one star."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying \"Chef Devin Hashimoto\" understands what it is to make eating at Mizumi memorable. If you come into this spot thinking you'll order your typical katsu or hamachi sushi than you have come to the wrong place. This is a place of french and japanese fusion with some classic Japanese dishes as well. Me and my party had practically everything you could order on this menu. This I am not lying about especially in my pictures. The food was meticulously hand crafted with a taste on point. The duck is to die for perfectly cooked slightly rare with nice flavors exploding in your mouth.  There was plenty of dishes that had interesting flavors blended with french flavors such as foie grau braised and seared in sake as well as short ribs and steak tar tar.  The service was excellent with great attention to what was being served to the table. Every item with complete description as well as how to approach the dish and eat it properly to get the most out of each dish.   Me being from Hawaii appreciated the very fresh poke with nori underneath. Nice touch as well as this gigantic lobster roll with a mix of teri and cream sauce. Very interesting rich buttery flavor as you ate the lobster with it.  If you go to this spot the omakase is definately a great option but if just ordering for yourself def get the duck. I'd have to compare the duck served here to the duck served at bouchon.   Last but not least the dessert with the signature chocolate mask was extremly fun to eat and interesting as a piece of art. It was a chocolate dessert with this japanese mask that was edible. Really cool! Really tasty... haha  Alright tired of typing. This is really a great spot try to grab that table by the waterfall with the $2000 min hahaha It's really beautiful."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and food!  Highly recommend the omakaze!  This is the best sushi and best Soba noodles I have eaten outside Japan."}
{"text":"Everything was impeccable, from the service to the setting (which is stunning) to the sushi, and ohhhhh how good the sushi is. I got a Philadelphia roll, scallop roll, and albacore sushi. Each piece of fish melts in your mouth like butter, and the presentation is clean but beautiful. What else can I say about it?!"}
{"text":"Since we had had such a great dinner the last time, we decided to go for our 10th anniversary.  We sat at the sushi bar... service was good, the the quality of the sushi was not as expected.  Salmon sushi was not good and the shrimp tempura roll was awful.  I told the sushi chef and he shrugged his shoulders.... both items appeared on our check. On the positive side, they did give us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary... it was delicious  Unfortunately though, we will not go back The food is too pricey for such a low quality of fish"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing restaurant !!  Everything was perfect !!  I like to have just GOOD experience , so , I really recommended this place ."}
{"text":"I love everything about this restaurant! The contemporary atmosphere had a fine dining Asian appeal with the red and white decor. My favorite part of the restaurant was the view of a huge waterfall from anywhere in the restaurant. It is absolutely gorgeous! The food was amazingly delicious as well. We ordered a bunch of stuff and each dish that was dropped off just got better and better. We had:  - Udon Noodle Soup (we wanted to share it and they split it into two bowls for us without prompting) - Yellowtail Sashimi and Jalapeno Gelee - Rainbow Roll - Scallop Tataki and Crispy Shrimp Roll (our favorite dish!) - Robatayaki: Black Tiger Shrimp - Robatayaki: Saikyo Miso Sea Bass - Robatayaki: Mugifuji Pork Belly - Robatayaki: Beef Tenderloin - Baked Sweet Miso-Marinated Black Cod  (This is a late post as we dined in November 2017)"}
{"text":"You get a fountain view. Ask for a fountain side table  Rainbow roll - 8.5/10 Grilled Cod - not that good 6/10  OMAKASE Wagyu beef grilled - 9/10 Kosh (type of snapper) - 9.5/10 Omakase overall - 8/10"}
{"text":"***************************** 1,029 *******************************          Mizumi took over the OKADA spot, above Tryst Nightclub, a beautiful place, the entire restaurant offers stunning views of Mizumi's private gardens, koi pond, and waterfall. You can enjoy the delicious aromatic coming from that Mizumi's teppan room.           During CES 2014, I couldn't get the table with the view because it was a last minute and we did like 2, 3 dinners per night with all our clients and vendors. I ended up at the bar instead.          Mizumi was named \"Best Chef on The Strip\" by Vegas Seven, Chef Devin Hashimoto uses his fresh approach to Japanese robatayaki, teppanyaki and sushi at Mizumi.         Love the sake menu Daiginjo Junmai was delicious and well-priced selection.   - Otoro $30   - Uni $18  - Abalone $20  - Kanpachi   - Sake with green salsa sauce   - Maguro with 24K gold flake  - Hamachi Jalapeño Gelée   - Hamachi kama - this was odd, that it wasn't in the fish head itself, but the meat has been removed to serve. I'd be perfect if  the meat was still intact in the yellow-tail head.   -Octopus carpaccio - this was so tender, tangy and quite nice.   - The pork belly - was just perfectly cooked, crispy skin just how we liked it.   - Marbled American Wagyu shortrib $65, kabocha puree, confit matsutake mushrooms, chestnuts, red wine miso sauce, cooked sous vide for 72 hours, is melting in your mouth goodness.         Service at the bar was off. Can't just blame it on CES 2014, we had to waive down our bartender a few times to get water refill, and ordered more sake. Price point was reasonable to the quality that they serve here. It's good, but I still prefer Blue Ribbon at Cosmopolitan as my number one sushi place in Las Vegas, to follow by Yellowtail at the Bellagio.         However, if you can score the table with the view here, it's quite romantic and such a great date spot!"}
{"text":"Really some of the best fish, sushi, and experience we had in Vegas. It was so good we went twice in 1 week. The menu is pricey for some specialty items but the fish was so fresh. Will return."}
{"text":"Mizumi is a pretty posh spot with some interesting drinks and delicious food. This place is a Japanese joint with a bit of a modern twist. Common sushi and delicious sashimi can be had here but the beef and lobster are absolutely delicious! The ambiance and decor are both modern, eclectic and amazing. Now, I would highly recommended finishing off your meal with dessert as they have this cute little dessert dish with a geisha mask made of white chocolate oh and try to wash the whole thing down with one of their alcoholic punchbowls, it's an experience you won't forget. Highly recommended.   Pros- Located within the Wynn Menu  Alcohol  Desserts  Sushi Decor  Ambiance  Shared punchbowls  Substantial wine menu  Cons- Average service   Pricey  Portions can be a bit small"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants at the Wynn! I used to be a frequent visitor of this restaurant when it was Okada and just came here for the first time after the restaurant became Mizumi. I realized that a lot of customers now enjoy their traditional Japanese food, but I am such a big fan of teppanyaki, I couldn't help but sit at the teppanyaki tables!  Between a party of two, we shared:  Oysters: Half a dozen of really sweet and fresh oysters!   Oh Toro, Chu Toro, Giant Clam, and Sweet Shrimp sushi - everything was amazingly fresh. I personally though the Oh Toro was too fatty for my taste. I will be sticking with Chu Toro and normal Tuna from now on. The sweet shrimp sushi was amazing. They usually have live amaebi as well, where they fry the heads, but they ran out that night. =(   One of my favorite sashimi is lobster sashimi! We got a whole lobster of sashimi and it was seriously too much food for two people! It came out in a wonderful presentation and it costed $98 for 1.5 oz!   For teppanyaki, I don't think much has changed from Okada.  A lot of the chefs have worked there for close to 10 years. I have tried the Kobe beef before, but this time, I just got the Surf and Turf. I believe it was $145 per person. It came with a lot of steak and lobster. There were two options for beef: either sirloin or tenderloin. I personally liked the sirloin better. The beef was really tender. There was SO much food. We basically took an entire order of the Surf and Turf to go. MY FAVORITE PART WAS THE FRIED RICE. SOO GOOD!!   For drinks we got the Mizumi Blue and Sinatra Smash, both were amazing!"}
{"text":"this place had pretty good food with a cool atmosphere about it.  my only critique of this place was that the sliding glass doors that go out to a patio can create a wind-tunnel effect on a windy night when the doors are closed....and it gets VERY loud.  other than that, i'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ate here twice, disappointing both times. Robata Platter was dry. The seafood soup was tasteless.  There was 1 piece of rubbery shrimp and 1 piece of fish floating in the tasteless water.  Definitely not trying this place a third time.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Dynamite oysters. Like butter. U must try the sea bass. It was buttery and oily and delicious !!!! The tuna roll was so delicate, this is not your all u can eat kind of place. The service was perfect, we had Jisrael as our waiter.(the spelling is correct). Our Chef was a very nice gentleman named Joe.  Great conversation while.he prepared our meals. Did not douse soy sauce on everything to hide the food. All the vegetables were organic. My wife had steak and scallops...delish. we will be back"}
{"text":"i was a guest at this restaurant when it was okada and experienced the outside table with the waterfall with omakase. the experience was AMAZING and i never forgot this place! it was recently remodeled and now named mizumi but still has for the most part same menu and the same exec chef!  visited vegas last week and made sure i made a reservation and told my friends to also join and try it out. i will say that on our table we had a wide range of people with different taste and in all EVERYONE was completely blown away by chef devin's omakase. i had my mother in law, wife and employee all from japan. i myself from hawaii and two friends from LA who are also foodies.  if you come here know that it is in the wynn hotel and you should expect to pay more than your average spot. compare the price to other restaurants in the wynn or just what you pay for sushi in a hotel period and i think this place gives you so much more of an experience and is very much worth the price.  OMAKASE! well worth it and the chef will make it happen! trust me!  wants a little more detail on the dishes read steve's review and check the pics he was one of my friends from LA who joined.  tell chef devin i sent you! lol!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Very fresh. You need be dressing in business casual for a table. If not you will be at the sushi bar. We had the Kimchee Cucumber roll, it has a lot going on. The edamame, it was good. The yellow rail with jalapeño was good as well."}
{"text":"Worst and smelliest sushi I have ever had in my life! We were a party of 9 and ordered just about every kind of roll and sashimi they had and didn't like one thing."}
{"text":"Kitschy, Instagram-able dessert aside, I was actually quite looking forward to eating here.  Super disappointed that it turned out bad.   We were seated at a great booth with probably the best view of the waterfall you could possibly have.  Our server was ok.  She seemed a little frazzled but attentive enough (although a good server should not show stress at this level of dining).  We ordered a bottle of champagne for the table and when it came, it was warm.  If you're going to spend a good amount of change on a bottle of champagne it better come to you palatable.  We informed them of the issue and the sommelier gave us excuse after excuse.  I understand that you don't want to have to comp this but it's not like we were doing anything shady.  The champagne was warm.    A second sommelier came by with the second bottle that they had chilled on ice first (which they made sure to tell us multiple times) and it was better.  Although, I do think that they made a bit of a show out of it because the dude FILLED the bucket to the very very brim full of ice.  Now you're taking it a bit too far.  One thing that bugged me was that our champagne glasses were empty, the server did a quick drive by but never refilled them or even came back on her own.  Apparently it was time to ignore our table.  We ordered our appetizers first before the entrees and I'm sure glad we did because after we ate them and finished our champagne we left.  The food was so underwhelming.  The yellowtail with jalapeno gelee was not flavorful.  The lobster miso left a strange taste in my friends mouth and a few hours later she felt her stomach hurting.  The sushi was HORRID!  No distinguishable flavors (we couldn't even tell which was which) and the rice was overcooked, soggy, and flavorless.  We also didn't even receive some of the items we ordered, like the bone marrow.    The only reason I don't give a 1 star is because the restaurant is gorgeous.  That's it."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant, the ambiance, the decor, the view of the fountain! Fantastic place. Very elegant and romantic!. Portions were a bit small but packed with flavor. Had a nice dinner before heading to a show.  Among my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  Will eat here again!  Fantastic view.  Fantastic food - some of us were sushi lovers and some of us were not and we all loved it!  A little expensive but worth every penny.  We go to Vegas every year - we will eat here every time!"}
{"text":"Very high end with high end pricing.  I hosted a customer and it was very good.  4 stars as I have had better, but a great spot and a very nice meal."}
{"text":"Me encanto el lugar. Placentero la comida buena. El ambiente agradable. El precio adecuado pero no es caro. Totalmente recomendable."}
{"text":"Had the waldorf salad to start, a few sushi rolls, and oysters. The rolls were aaaammmmzing, the oysters were a bit fishy (i like some spice on my oysters, and they didn't have anything).  Atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"I have loved Wynn for over ten years since we first visited.  But they renovated and got rid of many good restaurants (such as Boterro and Society Cafe). Their Japanese restaurant was also one of the restaurants they got rid of.  Their former Japanese restaurant OKADA was much much better in decor and also menu.  Mizumi (if this is still regarded as Japanese restaurant) Decor became so cheesy and loud that is lack of elegance.  now it looks like one of a Chinese restaurants.  No elegance in decor but just \"red\" everywhere.  Sushi chefs wear red caps (that warned me something wrong here).   Don't take me wrong. I love red, especially red decor of Ancore lobby floor BEFORE they renovated! It is a mystery why they got rid of the gorgeous red (chandeliers and many of exquisite decor) that made Ancore so special. Somehow they painted everywhere in white that made them look cheap now....  Anyway, their Sushi-raw fish display didn't look impressive judging from selections and how fresh it looks. I looked around and checked Sushi plates on the tables, too and decided to pass raw fish this time.   We were assigned best view sheet in front of the waterfall and that was maybe the price we had to pay.  The food was nothing \"wow\", creative or exquisite.  Kobe beef 2oz (yes, 2oz not 20oz) for $110 was especially disappointing despite of our high expectation because of the price (wouldn't you expect something totally amazing for that price for that portion?).  I had many Kobe beef before but this was the most ordinary taste (didn't even taste like the best) and the most expensive one.  We also ordered beef tartar and fillet (US beef) that was good but nothing like \"wow you can't get this anywhere else!\". Honestly Kobe beef we got didn't taste any better than these US beef (though there was more fat).  They took so long to serve everything even though it was half empty at 5:30 on weekday. They also didn't care about what to serve at what timing. We ordered one roll and bowl of rice that came in between meat dishes so we sat there eating only rice for half an hour.  We could have ordered more but became full as we waited so long between each dish. We left full but weren't \"satisfied\".   Also, Asian Sake pourer with suit on (sommelier?) didn't show courtesy at all and made us feel uncomfortable (is that because we didn't order most expensive Sake bottle I wonder?)  Go somewhere else if you want to celebrate special occasion and spend this much money ($300 for two without tip). Just not worth the money.  Generally, Wynn/Ancore after renovation is disappointing. Many of nice things are gone and so is the knockout gorgeous atmosphere.  It's somehow downgraded now (compared to amazing \"before\") and it's such a shame.   They should have kept their great restaurants and decor rather than spending money to make it \"less\".  So sad as I have truly loved Wynn/Ancore for its uniquely gorgeous atmosphere that you couldn't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Don't come here for a budget conscious meal. If you can splurge, the food is top notch.   Five of us shared a sushi platter for four, snow beef ($100 for 5 tiny but heavenly slices), the Robata platter, and a few rolls.   The sushi was extremly clean and fresh. The Uni was amazing....Two days later I am still craving that meal."}
{"text":"Bottom line: poor quality for value - less than average food for an incredibly high price. If you want good sushi in Vegas, go somewhere else!  We had the salmon box sushi customized so it had to have been freshly made but it tasted like it was prepared earlier. The rice was too cold - like it had just come out the refrigerator.   We also had a salad like dish with chicken imitation meal that we were promised had a great taste with quinoa.... It tasted like fake frozen meat you'd get at a supermarket.   We tried to give the waitress hints that the meal was less than satisfactory but she didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"I really loved this restaurant.  I thought the food was beautiful and the atmosphere was tranquil.  I am also not a desert person, but their rice balls filled with sorbet are truly stunning.  GREAT."}
{"text":"yes.. omakazi please.. i think thats spelled wrong.. but yes.. it was good..  =) ill be back for sure"}
{"text":"I read about this place on various fb magazine newsfeeds..so researched on yelp..also read that the executive chef is from hawaii..we people from hawaii always support other fellow locals..my first time here n ohh myyy the decor inside so beautiful! I even got a great table by the waterfall! My server she was absolutely nice n super cool! Helpful with explaining menu items..i ordered the omakase..very happy that i did! Omgosh every dish was beautiful n deeelicious! My fav was...all of it! I've been to alot of restaurants n so far this place is the best! I will definitely be back for the omakase again becuz the server said it changes..aaand of course to try other dishes!! Yummm!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!  The chefs and sous chefs had it down and I praise them. Sadly, we were dressed \"Trendy 100 degree resort\" but they would not allow us a table. I do understand dress codes, BUT allowing men in sweats and a white t-shirt come in and be seated???  I guess our $600 bill for two wasn't good enough for your establishment. Very disappointed in our treatment. We were told if we went to change they wouldn't hold our reservation. Everyone was really friends EXCEPT the FOH manager. Shame on you and we will not return or send anyone your way.  Thank you for ruining our anniversary dinner"}
{"text":"We had a lovely view of the waterfall and the room is beautiful.  First star! The waiter was professional and nice! Second star. The food.....Zero Stars! If you really love and appreciate Japanese food don't eat here. The essence of Japanese food is to highlight the quality ingredients and prepare them excellently.  This is not done here.  Just one example is that the hamachi collar was prepared by being baked, rather than grilled: one side was burnt and the other side raw.  It was really disgusting. I enjoyed the setting but not the food."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner and sat right by the breathtaking waterfall! It was definitely like a dream. I loved all the rolls we ordered + the cocktails. Everything was fresh and tasty.   Great place."}
{"text":"With high expectations, we arrived at Mizumi to celebrate our anniversary.   We were seated at a table with a beautiful view of the waterfall area and our server was incredible. She was attentive and sweet and definitely made our anniversary dinner special.   I had researched the menu in advance and also read through all the Yelp reviews for suggestions on what to order. We decided on a few different items, both from the sushi and robatayaki menus.   We started with the Mizumi roll and I was a little disappointed. All the ingredients sounded great together but the taste didn't live up to the expectation. It just didn't taste as fresh and flavorful as I had hoped. The lobster was a little chewy, but the rest of the ingredients seemed on point. My fella had raved about this roll, having been the Mizumi before, so even he was let down by it on this occasion. The brussel sprouts were good, albeit a little overdressed in balsamic vinegar. I still loved them. The highlights from what we ordered were probably the rice balls, pork belly, bacon wrapped enoki and another roll (I can't remember the name for the life of me) that I enjoyed a lot more than the Mizumi roll. I've had better versions elsewhere, but these were very tasty. My least favorite items were the sweet potatoes, shishito peppers and eggplant. I rarely meet a shishito pepper or eggplant dish that I don't enjoy, so these were particularly disappointing to me.   We ended our meal with the Mizumi mask dessert. I had low expectations for this, since I mostly ordered it expecting it to be a good photo op over actually enjoying the dessert. It was tasty, but definitely nothing amazing. It did have a wow factor as far as presentation goes, though.   Our anniversary was great, mostly due to the fantastic company and excellent service, but the food was just ok on this visit. I am interested in trying more of their menu options another time, but I'd likely skip most of what I ordered during this dinner. I have no idea if we just arrived on an off night, but I'd likely give them another whirl in the future."}
{"text":"My love and I had a great time at Mizumi. We really appreciated how accommodating the staff and chef was with our Kosher needs and request. It was very romantic and the vibes were sexy! Thanks!!!!   Pricing expensive but sometimes one must spoil themselves."}
{"text":"I do have good memories here. The service is always very pleasant. But I'm can't be too sure about the food.."}
{"text":"Yes, I really enjoyed my sushi experience at Mizumi, when I said to the Chef.  omakase wa kudasai, and he took me on a nice sushi experience.  I also had some very nice Sake, which enhanced the meal."}
{"text":"We had dinner here at Mizumi before our Le Reve Dreams show at Wynn Theatre.  Got seated in front of beautiful man made waterfall it was very serine.  Their sushi and sashimi menu from the best of around the world I knew I had to try them.  They didn't disappoint me at all.  Some of the exceptions were: sweet shrimp from Alaska were plump firm and sweet as can be; my favorite mirugai as good as if I had it from Tsukiji market and I've had many from there. I usually don't care for salmon but they were exceptional \"Organic Wild from Scotland\"! You must try some.  Finally their Albacore and Sea Urchin from the best of Santa Barbara's coast as usual best as can be!!  My wife not the raw sashimi person had yaki-nigiri and robatta yaki set they were all very tasty and grill with flavor and the aroma were priceless. With out going around the world our local boy from Hawaii Head Chef Davin Hashimoto as I can see doing very well, although he was off with his kid this night, my compliments to the chef.  If it wasn't for my nephew Ryan mentioned his classmate as chef here, he had dinners with his classmates the previous night, we would've missed this place.  It made our stay here at Wynn complete Would definitely come back again and again!"}
