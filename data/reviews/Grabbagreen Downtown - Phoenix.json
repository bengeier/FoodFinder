{"text":"The Acai cup there was kinda gross , the texture looked lil slimy  , and it costed $7 , it didn't really taste and looked like other acai cups/bowls i eat at other places . 
But the customer service there was patience and friendly ."}
{"text":"Love grabba green. Just not their prices. 20 bucks for a small grain bowl (all priced at 10) and a smoothie at 7."}
{"text":"Had the grabba green Gulf of Mexico salad substituted the shrimp with salmon. It's incredible!  I've been waiting a long time for a downtown spot that serves this kind of food for a looooooong time (organic/healthy/seafood/flavorful).  This is my new lunch spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Don't let a long lunchtime line deter you. My grabba grain bowl was love at first bite: I literally had to avoid shoveling forkfuls into my face too quickly. My treat was the SoCal, and the ingredients speak for themselves: soft feta and quinoa noodles, all jumbled in with warm chicken, avocado, tomato, balsamic and mint. Mint! So fresh. The only reason I won't be back more often is the $10 receipt; it's a tough lunch price, but worth every penny if you are looking for a high-quality bite downtown."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer of Grabba Green for some time now because I like the healthy, quality food. However, the service is hit and miss. My order is often wrong the first time and I must go back and ask them to fix something. The staff has been argumentative and immature on multiple occasions. 

Today when I placed my order, a living wage surcharge of 30 cents was added to my order. I asked the cashier about this and she said she couldn't remove the charge. I have only heard of this type of charge being added in OR and WA at sit-down server restaurants. Even in those states, where the tolerance for this type of intrusion is more accepted, it was only done at restaurants where the servers were paid below minimum wage and relied on tips. Not in a fast casual restaurant. I will not be returning to this restaurant or any restaurant that forces its customers to tip prior to service being provided."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful and conveys the message of health and whole foods. The food though was the most bland terrible food I have ever spent 7.50 on. I got the Senoran breakfast sandwich the idea is great the execution was absolutely terrible. It tasted like nothing at all"}
{"text":"Great selection and menu. Employees were very welcoming and patient for first time visitors. Seating area is limited."}
{"text":"I was downtown for a meeting, suddenly came down with a craving for salad, found this place on Yelp, and waddled my pregnant self over there for lunch.  Grabbagreen's menu is awesome, everything sounds insanely delicious, and despite my initial intention I ended up getting a yummy quinoa mixture of some sort with chicken and magic ... I can't remember the name, but I certainly recall inhaling my lunch.  It was delllliccciiouusss.  I only wish Grabbagreen was located closer to my work.  Maybe I'll get lucky and new location will pop up in the future!"}
{"text":"Went here for thw first time today. Places had a cool concept and the prices for the grain bowls are reasonable but was not crazy about the taste at all... The food was very bland and dry, needed some sort of sauce or something or a little salt. I've tried other places similar with the same healthy ingredients and they are much better.. disappointed because I had high hopes and I was hungry :/"}
{"text":"My husband and I both got an acai cup and they were amazing! Good customer service and very clean place. Love the location"}
{"text":"Ordered the COCOCABANA and added granola. Very pricey and the acai was incredibly slimy. Every time I took a spoonful it looked like snot. I have had acai plenty of times and it never had that consistency. 

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Cool chairs and awesome juices and smoothies. The food looks good too but was too full from breakfast. They also have elixirs for coughs and flu and stuff that my mom tried that she really liked."}
{"text":"Bomb.com for an extreme healthy place. They have smoothies, fresh juices, acai bowls, salads and grains. I can't give an in depth review since I only had a smoothie. I had the Oxcidation Elimination smoothie, it was delicious healthy fruit and veggies. I wish I would have tried more, I will if I ever go back out to Phoenix."}
{"text":"So many healthy options I absolutely love it!  The smoothies are great and filling with lots of options!  This is my healthy lunch spot when I haven't meal prepped!"}
{"text":"Perfect healthy spot,everything is super fresh and it's all so affordable & really yummy ! The staff is friendly as well. I love the juices and the salads."}
{"text":"Absolutely the Best Juice Bar in Downtown Phoenix! Large open space, great ambience and a huge selection of food and drinks. Fresh healthy juice and prepared immediately after you order. I ordered the Vibe juice and it was real juice with no sugar added. Very refreshing! The staff was pleasant and very professional, they answered my questions on the benefits of certain ingredients. Love this place and I'll be back frequently."}
{"text":"I like that you have the option to customize your salads, juices and smoothies.   My favorites are:
1. grabba grain - tokyo bay
2. smoothie - vita vamp
3. juice - love and detox"}
{"text":"Food was great but wait times are horrible.  Ordered online which I thought would help with time but boy was I wrong.  Waited a whole hour for my order.   I literally sat and watch people who arrived way after me get their orders. 

This totally killed my experience.  One I was super hungry and two I was excited to try this place."}
{"text":"Very good menu! Lots of smoothies, nice space, very yumm florentine breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Came here because I wanted to eat something healthy but didn't feel like cooking. 
I tried the indochin grab a grain and the love pressed juice and paid close to $20 for those two items. 
I honestly wasn't impressed nor do I feel like it was worth the money.
I'm willing to give it another try because I'm trying to find a healthy local restaurant and there were other items on the menu that looked appetizing and sounded interesting.
Plus based on other reviews of this place I feel like I just picked the wrong items."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy place to eat with vegan options while attending an event at the Phoenix Convention Center. Despite the heat, the walk wasn't far. I created my own bowl and felt like I was given enough choices and didn't need to add more (most places limit you to two or three add-ins, it was five on top of your rice and protein here). Each bowl was $10 and the portioned appeared to be small, but I was full before I even finished mine. Very fresh ingredients, as well. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a healthy option in this area!"}
{"text":"We eat very healthy at home but if I served overcooked, bland, shapeless, colorless food, devoid of flavor, I would be out of the kitchen. 
Healthy does not mean bad tasting. Healthy can and should taste good. I am not sure who gave this place such high marks I just hope it lives up to its opinion and adjusts the menu to add flavor and visual appeal."}
{"text":"Least enthusiastic staff Ive run across in a while but the food was great. Had a Mediterranean Sea salad, it was delicious. And there is a doughnut shop next door, what more do you need in life?"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service and amazingly delicious healthy food/drinks!! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I tried this place because it is adjacent to a donut store. It is very clean and the service was top notch. The Gulf Of Mexico salad was really good. I was a little skeptical because we don't have these restaurants where I am from but it was a very good salad."}
{"text":"I had the Moroccan Mac & Cheese.  Meh.  It wasn't all that cheesy and overall was just average.  It didn't stand out in any way.  The portion was quite small for $10.  I don't think they'll be grabbin my green again :-)"}
{"text":"Tasty food, and good for you. They let you substitute items, so you can build your own healthy meal. Wish they had a few more (affordable) drink options, where you don't have to spend at least $4-5 to get a drink, which can add up when you're already spending at least $10 for your meal.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"For a place that's all natural foods (which are alright) they should really cut down on styrofoam and plastic! Chicken soup is uneventful."}
{"text":"This place is amazing so many options. Great food and so many housemade sauces to pick from. I had everything on the menu and I can't get enough. Very filling feels like I can barly make a dent in my bowl. I come here everyday and it has changed my way of living. Grabbagreen is the best. I will always be happy and healthy with Grabbagreen around."}
{"text":"Update: not going back. Every time I go here my stomach feels a little upset. Not sure why, but it happened 3 times. Still loved going"}
{"text":"The place where I get my fit food on. Smoothies are great and the food is bomb. I recommend this place if you ever In downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Cool ambiance, friendly staff and excellent healthy food options. I tried the Tokyo Bay which has salmon, veggies, avocado and brown rice. It was delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"I would give it 10 stars if I could- I went in the other day for lunch and built my own bowl which was delicious but what I was REALLY impressed with was how truly jazzed the man helping me was to help me make the best selections possible. He was overwhelmingly helpful, never rushed my truthfully slow decision process, and I left with a smile on my face. Will DEFINITELY be back in soon."}
{"text":"Bland, toddler-sized portions.  I am all for eating healthy and eat salads for lunch every day, but for $13, I was handed a tiny cardboard box filled halfway to the top with tasteless ingredients finely chopped and mixed together....much like you would prepare food for a toddler.  Not even Sriracha sauce could save this meal.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, and it was so-so. Ordered the Moroccan Mac 'n cheese with broccoli instead of chicken. Came with quinoa macaroni, not much cheese, and some kind of red sauce. Interesting, unique flavor but definitely doesn't taste anything like a traditional Mac and cheese. Nice that they had great variety of healthy and vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. Pleasant, clean, and fresh ambiance. Directly connected to a cool donut shop if you're craving an unhealthy dessert to top of your healthy meal ;-) very professional, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Wonderful friendly workers. Highly highly recommend this great establishment!"}
{"text":"I was just trying to be healthy while I was stalling time and I came across this place. I got the smoothie with the strawberries and mangoes and pineapples, and agave and I added protein. Soweeyyy!! I can't remember the name and I just went there today lol
It tasted healthy, so take that how you want lol
I would come back and prob try the Southwestern bowl with quinoa. I really didn't feel like paying $15-$20 for a meal today but the service was great and the smoothie was good."}
{"text":"So many healthy options! I only tried a fresh pressed juice, detox, which was very good, but I can't wait to come back and try some other things  on the menu!"}
{"text":"I generally enjoy coming to this place because I enjoy the healthy options but was not impressed with the customer service. I noticed the avocado in my meal was spoiled and when I told the staff they offered to give me a new meal or swap it out. I chose to just get a new side of avocado and again that was spoiled!! I went back to the staff and said you need to take that avocado off the shelf and they just looked at me. I work in a restaurant and considering the inconvenience I don't feel enough was done to address the situation not was there any care towards me who nearly lost my appetite over the spoiled food."}
{"text":"For \"healthy\" food, this place was quite tasty!!  I'm glad we came here.  We kind of just saw this place and decided to give it a try.  I wouldn't say it's the best food we ever had but for healthy type ingredients, they did a great job at combining various flavors together to make it taste yummy.  I'd definitely give this place a try again the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great bowls. The southwest is my go to.  Shakes are good too, but you are kidding yourself if you think they are healthy."}
{"text":"Got a smoothie, breakfast sandwich, and salad. The smoothie was solid. The sandwich and salad on the other hand were a big disappointment. Very bland and small portions given the premium pricing. Healthy food doesn't have to taste like cardboard"}
{"text":"WOW! This place hit the spot! Healthy and delicious? YES! 

I am in town visiting and keep going back.  Everything I have had so far is fantastic!  The smoothies and juices are so refreshing on these hot summer days and the Energy Elevator (smoothie with espresso) has gotten me through some long days!  But what really gets me is the amazing sauces! From the agave bbq to the creamy avocado to the miso ginger - insane. The sauces make all of their grain and green based bowls so tasty!  Ohhhh and the Mac and cheese with quinoa noodles...tastes like it would be 'bad' for you but there is no guilt at this place! 

I am also really impressed with the staff and customer service.  Each time I have gone in they have been friendly and seem to have a passion for the food and whole food concept.  The place is super clean and the decor is bright to go along with the freshness of their food! 

And to top it all off... they are expanding across the country (no surprise with this concept).  I just found out they are opening in my hometown in Raleigh, NC.  Best news ever!!!!

I encourage everyone to check out Grabbagreen!  Tastes great and it feels good!"}
{"text":"Fantastic healthy food that tastes great!  Kids loved it too!  Tons of choices for every diet. What a great find for us and close to our hotel."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a quick health option. Lines usually move quickly and the wait time is minimal. They have a variety of different lunch or breakfast meals to choose from along with a variety of fresh juice or smoothies. Ingredients have been fresh every time I have visited. They have a cooler of lemon water which I always drink if it has been filled. They seem to go through it quickly and don't seem to refill it as often as needed. The price is a little bit higher that what I would normally spend on lunch meal but I think it is worth it for the freshness of the ingredients."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING. Everything here is delicious! Whether it is a smoothie or a grain bowl. Super impressed and happy to have found this place. The moroccan mac and cheese is awesome and same with the Southwest. I love the Energy Elevator as a smoothie. Its like a choco banana shake but with a little coffee hint at the end."}
{"text":"I have only come here for juice so my review is based solely off of that. 

Their juice menu is nice with a lot of options and, of course, you can make your own. It's priced a little higher than what I would consider their biggest competitors around the valley but it's convenient downtown. I do wish that they had a bigger size - the girl at the register told me 16oz is the largest juice. I usually come at off-times so it's not too bad. However, the wait for a juice is kind of longer than I would prefer to wait (even at off times). Today, it took 10 minutes to even start my juice - which I modified from their menu. The girl at the register wasn't very helpful but that's fine. They did make my juice wrong, though, which caused a little bit of a longer wait. They were super nice about it though and took out the ice but I'm not sure the missing ingredient was added and honestly didn't have any more time to wait."}
{"text":"This juice joint is located parallel to Squid Ink Sushi Bar and right around the corner of my building. I swung by today and ordered the Energy juice with strawberries instead of apples. It was so yummy and tangy and truly perfect for this steaming hot Arizona weather! I will definitely have to come back and try their food. They have healthy options like grain bowls (rice, meat, veggies and toppings), and even breakfast items- I can't wait to try their mango bowl! Definitely a great place for a quick healthy bite. Service is on point and even with a line that almost stretched outside of the doors today, I was in and out in under 10 minutes."}
{"text":"This place has a serious awesome menu! Their quinoa pancakes are my favorite! You can get them sweet or savory, I highly recommend the sweet! Topped with fresh fruit, agave, chia seeds, YUM! And their build your own protein bowls have so many options for add-ins! My sister has a strict diet so this is a go to when she is in town visiting! Great donut shop next door as well!"}
{"text":"I looooove Grabagreen. My wife and I moved away from the valley over a year ago and have missed it since. So, when we stopped in for the holidays, we had to get our GaG fix! This is an excellent place for anyone on a strict diet or with restrictions. They favor the plant based eater and still serve the carnivores. Five well-earned stars."}
{"text":"This place was good. I ordered a salad and it was good. The only thing that was a bit odd for me was the rice inside. I got my salad to go and it was packaged inside of a really small box. The salad was sort of layered instead of tossed and mixed then placed in a Togo container. But over all the salad was okay. The staff was polite and the establishment was clean."}
{"text":"I used to work downtown until 2016 when I moved to the airport. Grabbagreen was my spot. The food was great, tasted delicious, and even though I felt they were a little pricey i thought it was worth it. Today I happened to be in the downtown area today and was so exited to eat there.

I haven't been there in a year but I didn't think much would change but their portion sizes have. They used to serve in these boxes and I felt gave a good portion size. 

Now, they use miniature versions of Chipotle bowls and I'm disappointed. 13$ for what seems like less food than before. That's ridiculous! \"The ingredients are all fresh so they cost more.\" Salads and Go serves fresh ingredients and I get way more food for the price and their employees are a lot nicer. Looks like they will be my go to spot from now on."}
{"text":"Grabbagreen is one of my favorite places to eat at! Always delicious, tasty and healthy! I discovered this place during my lunch break on Jury Duty and have been obsessed with it ever since."}
{"text":"I am so bummed about this place. I was really excited to order food from here. I ordered a greens and it was to have chicken, kale, bean sprouts, and the almond sauce. I got my order back and it was missing the chicken! I didn't know it until I return back to the office. I am so bummed that this was my first experience."}
{"text":"Super healthy place to grab a delicious smoothie. They have a lot of delicious healthy options and super refreshing."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for juice and a salad. 18$ for my first visit. Not a huge salad guy but it was decent and so was the snoothie.

My only thought about the experience was why don't they have a recycle bin for as green as they claim to be."}
{"text":"Tried Grabba Green for the first time with my family.  Place is clean, well maintained and servers were very friendly. I built my own bowl which was very tasty; now the chicken needed a little spice, was a little on the bland side. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite place of my trip to Phoenix. I had a quinoa bowl and it was delicious. I also got a smoothie and it was great as well. Would recommend if in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"forgot my friends smoothie, very unprofessional, & forgot half of my toppings. very upset with this establishment"}
{"text":"So many options to choose from- you Can either pick grains or salad and decide the ingredients you want in each one. I wasn't too impressed by the outcome. Prices are reasonable-$7-$8 for their salad or grains. If compared to flower child, I would definitely pick flower child again just by the staff, appearance and dishes I tried. I ordered the French quarter- the shrimp was farmed, and it didn't taste fresh. Their juice tasted watered down."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, clean space but damn is it slow. I've visited and tried around 4 different smoothies and juices they've a all tasted rad, but at 7/8 bucks a piece I feel like I need to take out a small loan to make this a regular thing. I would suggest to the owners to visit to chop shop an take notes. Pre portioned containers of each offered beverage an just add ice. An boom you don't have my hot body crowding up your store for the 20 minutes I wait for what should be a 5-6minute process."}
{"text":"I love being able to walk over here during my work day and grab my smoothie for lunch.  Try the energy elevator...its a great pick me up and very filling."}
{"text":"Great customer service with knowledgable staff that patiently explained the menu to several people who looked confused. I had my grain bowl and smoothie within five minutes after ordering. This is a must stop for healthy-minded people on the go!"}
{"text":"A healthy alternative to some of the heavier restaurants or greasy fast food places near by. So far I have had their breakfast steak hash and a southwest chicken bowl on mixed greens. The chicken was moist and seasoned very well and the hash's sweet potato replacement of a traditional potato is a favorite flavor combo of mine. I also gave the boost, a pressed juice, a try. It had a really great flavor and I felt great about the healthy ingredients I was putting in my body, but it was a little watered down for my liking. This place is on the pricier side for a quick bite, so it'll be an occasional indulgence rather than a regular spot for me, but I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I really do like Grabbagreen.  The downtown location is great for work, but it isn't the easiest to maneuver from the door to the counter and back out again. There is a lot of congestion with people waiting. 

The food is delish, super healthy, and full of flavor. The portions, though, are a little skimpy for the price you pay."}
{"text":"I stopped in after yoga last weekend and ordered a wellness juice - carrots, strawberry, apple and lemon.  I was debating between two different juices and the server highly recommended the wellness, so I had to go for it!  It was absolutely delicious and so refreshing...I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very big establishment and spotless inside. I love how clean it is. Great smoothies, and the salmon stir fry with brown rice was so yummy!
  Great healthy place to grab a bite and a yummy shot of immunity boost when traveling through this area in AZ!"}
{"text":"This was a great lunch find the other day. They had some amazing food and drink selections. My bowl, the \"On the Border\", was fantastic. I liked the fresh and clean ambiance and the friendly service. Prices were a tad high, but more understandable considering the expensive real estate and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Lovely place, love how it is all clean food. Perfect menu covering variety options for salad bowl, grain bowl, smoothies, juices, acai cups, and bars. I could eat here everyday!

I got Gulf of Mexico, swapped out shrimp for steak and added beet. I also had cococabana cup. 

Update: I came back again and got mango bowl, so good! Also grabbed grabba-bar for my flight. How I wish there was a grabbagreen in DC!!"}
{"text":"We came down one evening to go Ice Skating by Cityscape. Since, we don't really get to experience ice here in downtown phoenix, unless it comes in some type of cold drink; we often try to partake of the ice skating venue even if we don't really skate that well.

After we were done, we opted to dine here at Grabbagreen. We had heard so much about their dishes, and wanted to give it a try.

We started with the Smoothies, and they were absolutely fabulous. Their taste and consistency were spot on, and they were both quite refreshing. And since we had these first, before our meal; we had great expectations as to how our bowls would taste.

Sadly, after a prolonged wait (nearly 20 minutes), I was presented with the Tokyo Bay bowl that really did not taste very good. It was absolutely bland, flavorless, and its aroma was none too pleasing.

My wife had the same experience with the Patagonia bowl as well.

I am certain that what we ate was very nutritious, but the flavors should also be taken into account as an added value to what should've been a wonderfully pleasant meal.

Needless to say, we left unsatisfied. We will probably give them another try, and order something else. Perhaps, our second time around will prove more rewarding than our initial impressions."}
{"text":"Five stars for being open when everywhere else was closed in downtown on a Sunday afternoon! Definitely a change from most other downtowns I have visited. The hotel restaurant was open but we weren't in the mood to spend a fortune on okay food for lunch.

First time ever at this restaurant. I am not sure if it is a chain but it seemed to be. The food is on the healthier fast casual side. They probably cater to the exercisers coming from Orange Theory fitness.

I ordered the Tokyo box and it was good. Warm salmon and brown rice with avocado and other veggies. It had way too much teriyaki sauce but other than that everything was good. My husband ordered the Mediterranean box and it also was good aside from the balsamic vinegarette. It just didn't go with the chicken, veggies and feta if you are trying to go for Mediterranean. Maybe one day they will add a Tahina sauce but I have my doubts.

Probably won't be back in this area anytime soon but if I found out they opened a new location in Cali I wouldn't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Portions are not as hearty/large as you would expect so in other words... you will likely still be hungry after your order.  Also, I ordered a Super Brew coffee which stated on the large menu \"$4.00\" and the person at the register rang it up for $6.52. When I asked why the total was so much higher she replied \"probably the tax\"... $2.52 tax on a $4 cup of coffee?? I declined the offer.  Be alert if you go."}
{"text":"This place is so great! If you need some real food to fill you up. Many many options or you could build your own. Always vegan friendly. 

The smoothies are nice and filling. The juices are cool too no added sugars or fillers just real. Whole. Fruits and veggies! 

Its great anytime, and you can come everyday without getting over it. Not many places can do great reallllll food fast and friendly (:"}
{"text":"Great option for fast food Style watch. Everything's fresh and  natural. The flavor profiles are great. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I LOVED grabbagreen!!! The food was very fresh and the customer service was quite stellar. I would highly advise the Patagonia bowl or the Southwest bowl (which is what my friend got)! I will definitely go back and I'm glad to see that they are expanding into other parts of the country considering I travel a lot for work!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent juices and smoothies with high quality ingredients.  A little pricey but that's to be expected when you have high quality ingredients.  Have not had the food only juice and smoothies."}
{"text":"Eat here!! This place is amazing!

I had never been to this restaurant before but was arranging a team dinner for when would all be in Phoenix for a convention. I love healthy food and it's so hard when I travel to find great food, so I was thrilled when I found this place online and realized we weren't just stuck with hotel food for our team dinner.

I called in advance, and Sarah was so helpful and accommodating. Everything was easy to arrange. When we got to the conference, we headed over, and even though they had been very busy, the service was fast, excellent and most importantly, the food was fantastic! Plus it was really reasonably priced, which our team appreciated, after having to pay high prices for not such great food at the hotels. 

Sarah also took all sorts of photos for us of our team and get-together, and then emailed them to me. Honestly, it was just a great experience and we will highly recommend the place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Grabbagreen was a lifeline for me while I was on work travel. Traveling while being a gluten-free vegetarian can be a huge pain in the a**! Grabbagreen made breakfast options super easy and delicious! Also, everything is gluten free!

Grabbagreen makes fresh and healthy smoothies - one size - HUGE ($7), Kids smoothies ($5), juices ($6), Acai cups ($7), Quinoa cakes ($7), bowls ($10), salads ($10), and wraps ($7). You can choose from a list of menu items or custom design your own blend. I mostly stuck with a custom made smoothie creation each day with banana, agave, spinach, pineapple, pear, almond milk, and whey protein. It always turned out well!  I also tried the Power PB&J with almond butter, banana, whey protein, alkaline water, and agave. I did not like it as much as the custom smoothie. The strawberry was a bit overwhelming. Most smoothies have approximately 220 - 450 calories.

I also tried their Almafi Coast salad with spinach, cucumber, tomato, red pepper, onion, kalamata olives, feta, chia seeds and a creamy avocado dressing plus a yogurt agave BBQ dressing. The salad was just okay. 

The staff for the most part was helpful. They offered advice and samples of various smoothies (if there are leftovers) and salad dressings. 

I wanted to pre-order in case there was a line in the morning but in reality there was never a line. I was typically the only patron each morning. They do have an app called Grabbagreen by ChowNow. You can schedule a pick up for now or for later. 

Grabbagreen is located directly across from the Kimpton Hotel and on the corner next to The Fractured Prune."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience and great food.  Four star does not mean it's a four star restaurant but it does mean that for what is it suppose to be it does a Dang Good Job!.  Try the elixirs and make yourself live forever; or at least until tomorrow.  Well I suppose that means that if you have an elixir everyday you could live forever.  

Their salads are great and unique.  Oh my goodness, don't leave without getting yourself a peanut butter bar.  Delish!!"}
{"text":"Amazing smoothies, some of the best in the world! Friendly staff and fast service, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Don't go if you only have an hour lunch. You'll wait in line for 25+ mins to order from one cashier, then wait an additional 20+mins for a juice! I ended up counting 6 people behind me got their cooked food before I got mine, even though the cashier told me a juice would be 7mins. By the time I got my food, my lunch hour was about up. The staff is completely ill-equipped to handle a lunch rush and no one is managing this place efficiently. The juice is good but not worth a 45min wait."}
{"text":"First of all the two young ladies working tonight but rad! Super helpful and did a heckuva job on my juice. It was late and they were about to close but there still willing to make me a juice even though they just clean their juicer. I changed my order so they didn't have to (I know how it is, yo) but they were still more than willing. 

I got the \"Energy\" juice and I added cucumber. I highly recommend it. I also got the miso salad and the sesame broccoli slaw. Only five bucks for the salads? That's a steal! 

I got a protein bar as well. It was delicious but a little expensive. I hope they don't raise the price on the slaw! I'm hooked. Spicy and light. Just like me.

Thank you Grabbagreen.

Note: Make sure you keep an eye on the dates of their salads though, they tried to sell some that were expired. Whoops!
They also list of the date of expiration and September even though it was still in the month of August. Double whoops."}
{"text":"The food was alright, didn't have a whole lot of flavor. Came here in the early morning and they were already out of several ingredients... I would expect that later in the day possibly, but an hour after you're open? 
The main reason for the 2 stars, however, is the staff. They moved slower than molasses. It wasn't busy at all and it took me about 30 min to get two smoothies... that's a bit ridiculous. Zero sense of urgency or care for the customers.
Considering there's several places in walking distance with a very similar menu, y'all need to step it up. I won't be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Nice little place, lots of selection.  Wanted something healthy and tasty for dinner, went with the Indochin.  Thought it had great flavor, the quinoa noodles were meh, almost wished the dish came with just regular quinoa instead.  Also by the time I got back to my hotel down the street it seemed like there wasn't enough sauce on the bottom half of the box, almost like they only tossed it with the veggies and chicken.  This could just be the nature of quinoa noodles, will possibly ask for extra sauce on the side next time.  Warning it does have a kick, it was just perfect for me though.
Will definitely be back, there juice and smoothie selection looked great too.  As for price I do agree with other reviews, just a smidge bit more than what I'd like to pay, based on the size but my Grabba grain was delish!"}
{"text":"Very expensive for the small portions you receive. Spent $15 for a bowl and a drink about an hour ago, and I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"So every Monday night my 3 daughters &i attend a weekly fun run downtown..afterward we reward ourselves with a treat, generally something green as I've become vegan a year ago. My favorite place is Grabbagreen. This last Monday we went &as soon as I walked in the girl working, her name is Katie, not only knew my name but also knew exactly what I order... the cococabana acai bowl w added strawberries!  I was so incredibly impressed by this girls great customer service. My husband owns his own business &this is what good workmanship is all about! Hold on to this girl, Grabbagreen :) &thank you Katie."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch during mid week and the place was fairly empty which was good. I had the Cajon shrimp and rice thing which was good and fresh tasting. Came out fast. Free cold filtered lemon water was a plus. Portion size was just right but for $10 I felt a little ripped off. I might come back when I feel like spending more money on health food but will more likely spend less money somewhere else most of the time."}
{"text":"The build your own grabbagreen boxes are always my go to here, they're filling and made with whole food ingredients!! The people that work here are super nice and helpful, it's never very busy in here, but I feel like it should be!! It deserves more credit!!"}
{"text":"Omg the Detox juice is delicious and does the trick.
Felt great clean establishment and the staff was awesome. I got signed up for their rewards program. Also if you are looking for juice cleanse day packs it is $50 per day here best I have found in the valley."}
{"text":"Normally really good, healthy food. Today I went for lunch and got a Patagonia bowl. It came out cold, meat slightly undercooked, and way too much onion and red peppers. Very disappointed, this place is usually so good. Also a bit pricey but usually the quality makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch! Menu is awesome food is delicious and reasonably priced:-) besides that the service is exceptional and they are willing to make suggestions based on preferences. I will be a regular! Thanks Gabba for giving me somewhere to look forward to for lunch:-)"}
{"text":"Grabbed a Spiritulina smoothie on my way home today. It definitely felt like I was drinking something fresh and healthy. The smoothie is BRIGHT green but it doesn't taste too earthy. It's mildly sweet and very refreshing.  The only bad thing it that they use Styrofoam cups! Ugh! I figured a place advertising green, healthy, real food living would also support sustainable practices. Thumbs down! I hope they change their ways because that will be the only time I'd consider coming back!"}
{"text":"We came into Grabbagreen for the first time thinking to try their smoothies or acai bowls but were pretty put off by the poor customer service. 

The place was pretty empty when we came in and there was no one in line. We waited around at the register waiting for someone to help us while the two employees were a couple feet away making drinks for the other customers. Although no one acknowledged our presence or greeted us, we could hear the employees discussing which one should help us. After an awkward five minutes of being ignored we decided to just grab some bottled juices from the refrigerator since we were short on time. We patiently waited a couple more minutes before asking if we were supposed to be paying ourselves on the screens in front of the registers since no one had said anything to us. We were just told 'no'. No 'we'll be with you shortly', or 'sorry for the wait', just 'no'. After another five minutes of waiting we were finally helped me an unfriendly employee who did not acknowledge our uncomfortable wait. 

This was definitely top of my weirdest and most uncomfortable experience at a dining establishment. We felt very unwelcome at Grabbagreen. I understand that the barista's were busy making drinks for other customers but I feel like they could have acknowledged that we came in or that were standing at the register for more than 10 minutes. Even when we asked all we got was a 'no'. The bottled juices we got were alright but our experience was greatly soured by the poor customer experience we received."}
{"text":"Wow, very impressed. Probably one of my favorite new places to visit. Had the feeling fabulous smoothie and the on the border salad with chicken. Not exactly vegetarian but very very please with my meal.

I recommend you try this place if you're anywhere downtown. Great service and will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I needed a detox fix so I looked up this place on Yelp! Good idea :) 

I arrived here during lunch time and there were only hand full of folks at this place so I was able to order right away without any wait time. I was waiting for my detox so I saw a cucumber and lemon water station which was actually pretty good. 

The place was very neat, clean and friendly. You do get a good fix of greens. I read some of the reviews here after my visit and I also think it's bit pricey like other have noted compare to other cities I have visited in the past.

Next time I would like to try a bowl"}
{"text":"Good job sir. PB&J was amazing. First time and was greeted really well, we will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, a little pricey for just salads and juice but all around good, healthy and quick."}
{"text":"Nice concept, reasonable prices!

Came here while on a business trip for breakfast and to try the juice.  For breakfast I had the steak hash which was pretty tasty, a bit on the sweet side because of the yams but I really appreciated having a healthy breakfast option instead of the usual gut busting muffins, pancakes, etc.  Portion was sensible and didn't leave me feeling stuffed or wanting to ptfo. 

I also tried one of their premade broccoli slaws which I thought was really tasty and a good quick healthy snack."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh, healthy food.  I had the So Cal bowl wich is quinoa noodles, chicken, and loads of veggies.  Delicious and satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"Who doesn't want to eat a bit healthier? And of course organic based food is going to cost a bit more--it should, it's harder to produce. But holy moley this place is waaaaaaay overpriced. And the food is ok. Not great. Mediocre really.  The \"entrees\" were a mac n cheese and a salad. Both teeny tiny and both 10.50. The smoothies were super watered down.  Way too much ice. Those were 8 bucks.  So 40 for a quick, mediocre and mostly thrown out lunch. Bone Apple Teeth!"}
{"text":"I was in town for an event at the convention center looking for a healthy smoothie breakfast.  Without a car and searching for something within easy walking distance of my hotel and the convention center, enter Grabbagreen. 

Your quintessential smoothie, salad, healthy shop with addition of cooked meals.  I love that you can adjust sauces and components to your taste without any pushback.  Smoothies likewise can be adjusted to taste, especially the create your own (go figure).  

There's plenty of seating amidst the green colored walls.  The ambiance is more of a clean and healthy fast food place than a cushy cafe.  Inviting enough to stay and enjoy your meal, but not the inviting space where you want to while away endless hours.  

It took a bit longer than I'd expect for my smoothie to blend up, but nothing horrendous."}
{"text":"Disappointed ... got an acai bowl ($7.50) which ended up being a plastic cup with the most liquidy watered down smoothie I've ever had - overly sweet tasting with not a lot of flavor, some granola and a ton of agave/honey on top. The cold brew sounded promising but was just meh - I didn't finish it. I was excited for a healthy option downtown but for $14 this was severely lacking."}
{"text":"Great Service! Lindsey, Blake, and Britney really know how to have fun on the job. There service isn't just quick but they are extremely helpful in suggesting great food!"}
{"text":"Walked over with my pup for a morning smoothie. I got the energy elevator. It was delicious and they are dog friendly too! We will be back"}
{"text":"Love this place! I can always count on what I order to be very fresh. Best of all the menu is super healthy and the food tastes amazing. I always order the Tokyo Bay with chicken. It's addicting!"}
{"text":"Brief, not bad and would do again however packaging could be a little more effective for dining in - use open bowls vs the closing cartons. But I can also see the effectiveness of using them. The French Quarter was okay and tasted fine. Might do this again if chosen for jury duty."}
{"text":"I've been a customer at the downtown location since the day it opened. I put up with prices because it's really one of the healthier options around. However, I won't be back due to quality. I've given them multiple chances, the last time was today. My order is consistently wrong or the food is ice cold (specifically the vegetables in the dishes that are supposed to be hot). For $10+, I should be able to count on quality and I shouldn't have to check it before I leave. Lastly, another pet peeve of mine, the shouting of Welcome to Grabba Green as people walk in. Even the cashier stops to shout it while taking an order. Talk about distracting the customer. If I want to be shouted at, I'd go across the street to Subway. At least they get my order right."}
{"text":"For those people in the downtown area on the go that seek a healthy alternative ... GrabbaGreen answers your call!

You know you're walking into something a bit more special then the cookie cutter Jamba Juice. Forget the plastic crates of oranges and the patches of wheat grass, GrabbaGreen proudly educates their guest with an easy to follow \"Periodic Table\" of veggies and fruits, clearly articulating what each one does to your body. So, take notes, and step up to order.

While GrabbaGreen does offer food, this review is focused on their smoothies. The day I walked in I was heading to court to finalize my divorce. Flu season was in full swing and my body just needed a bit of help to get me through the rest of the day. So, I decided to order the Immunization Station. A properly balanced blend of banana, strawberry, baby kale, immune powder, carrot juice, and agave.

Typically these \"so-called\" smoothies are filled with an overdose of sugars. But, not at GrabbaGreen. The first sip instantly brought a ray of hope and energy into my body. My mind cleared up and I was able to confidently stroll down the street to court and finalize my divorce.

So ... next time you find yourself in the downtown area and are in need of that lil' oomph ... head straight to GrabbaGreen. Trust me - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic healthy food !! I highly recommend !
Not only are there great salads but healthy smoothies as well . Excellent !!"}
{"text":"The concept is fabulous, all natural ingredients to choose from, lots of selections, personalized bowls but the delivery is not so great. The first order I got wasn't mine, and then when my order was delivered it was missing stuff. If you go there make sure to look in your box to see if you have everything before you step away from the counter. In my case it was the chicken that was missing."}
{"text":"I just went here to kill time and I was craving juice. This place is cute and I see what they're trying to do, I do. I'm all about well-being but this place is seriously overpriced. Paying almost $7 for a tiny cup of juice? I just don't get it. Maybe they use only organic, locally sourced products? I just don't see what the hype is all about. If I lived in Phoenix, I would just grow my own stuff or cook my own food. I can juice a whole pitcher for $7! I think I can get the same thing at robeks but with $7, I can get a way bigger cup of juice. I'm just saying."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had a delicious breakfast! I had the energy equalizer shake, and unique yummy breakfast sandwich. It was the perfect portion! We both were not over stuffed but pleasantly full. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good breakfast and some healthy food. The staff was so nice and helpful since it was our first time being there. We went back again for more later that week. And please open a branch in Erie,pa!"}
{"text":"I was feeling under the weather, so I popped in here to get something nourishing. This establishment has plenty of healthy and detoxifying beverages. They also have cough and slimming elixirs as well as power breakfast items. I wasn't very hungry and wasn't in a mood for heavy food, so I got a smoothie. I chose the Amazon whey. Great choice since it filled me up. The place isn't hard to find. It's at the cityscape behind CVS."}
{"text":"Loved it! The Amazonian drink I had kept me satisfied and full. Only thing I forgot to add was Maca Root. Did not expect a place like this out here. Wish I had one here in Brooklyn near my job. I'd be here daily."}
{"text":"I like the fact that there is a wide array of healthy food options at grabbagreen. Their food is flavorful but you don't leave feeling heavy. I really enjoy the southwest salad. They have a nice array of smoothies as well as elixirs, protein bars, and drinks such as water melon with Chia seeds. I would definitely recommend trying this place especially for a post workout meal"}
{"text":"$6 for a soupy \"chili\" it was so watery and it barely had beans and quinoa.  Did I mention greasy too ?"}
{"text":"So disappointed, it was a work order downtown with coworkers, tiny salad overpriced at $9.00!! With only 2 pieces of shrimp but advertised with more.  Also they forgot to cut up the bell pepper, yes half a bell pepper in the little, half filled, brown box- how lazy."}
{"text":"It took me a while to notice that GrabbaGreen was a separate restaurant from Chloe's but I finally woke up and slapped myself.  

Fresh juice here?  Well slap me again!  GrabbaGreen knows how to juice a juice.  I had become a bit fed up with Bowl of Greens (which is down the street at ASU) so I'm happy to have another option.  It took me a while to get through the menu, but I was coached by the guy behind the counter and he made it worth the effort.  

And if you like choices, this is choice heaven.  

The salad options didn't impress me too much but you can definitely plan a decent meal. 
Six-step process to salad recovery: 
1. Select grains or greens
2. Select flesh or legumes
3. Select 5 nutrients from nuts, veggies, fruits, sprouts, beans, olives, yam, onions
4. Select cheese
5. Select herb
6. Select dressing.  (The pomegranate sauce is delicious.) 

For breakfast or lunch, GrabbaGreen should be your goto for a quick raw food meal."}
{"text":"Ok first time here. Came at about 11:30 am on a Friday. Not busy at all! Excellent I beat the rush! Parked in the parking garage as this is downtown Phoenix. However the lady at the register will validate your ticket for up to 2 hours! Awesome free parking. I got the Energy Elevator. $7 kinda pricey but what healthy food replacement isn't. Well worth it, my drink taste really good. I'm a coffee drinker so this works for me. Very clean inside and large. It's connected to like some other cafe, ironically it's like a donut place LOL! Didn't walk over there. Overall I'm glad I drove the 7 miles up here. Will come back for sure and try some food."}
{"text":"Healthy food, clean, nice environment, very friendly staff. Bryce is an OG. -1 star because of the wee-too-high prices, but............ I still eat there almost daily. Grabbageen is like Chipotle with actual options (not just the illusion of choice that Chipotle offers) and higher quality food."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I do not usually post bad reviews. Also, I have been here multiple times and while the juices are always great, the salads/grain bowls have never lived up to my expectations. I've tried several and they have all been very bland. Unfortunately this is really the only place to go to for a quick 'healthy' option around dinnertime in downtown PHX. Kaleidoscope is amazing (both juice and food) but they close at 3. 

So...I came in to the restaurant yesterday around 7 pm. I ordered a Gangnam City salad and substituted salmon instead of steak. I also got a large Power juice. When I got home and opened the box, I noticed a terrible smell. It literally smelled like garbage. Taking a closer look, I realized that the bean sprouts were spoiled. They had a clear brown look to them and if you have seen fresh bean sprouts before, they are supposed to be crisp, opaque and white. I can't be sure that that alone was creating such a terrible stench, but it was definitely the main reason. The lettuce and salmon looked ok, so I thought I would try and salvage this meal and give it a chance. I literally picked out the bean sprouts, one by one, and transferred the rest of the ingredients into a different container. I then proceeded to douse the new plate in lime juice, hoping that it will take away any traces of that terrible smell. I took one bite and had to spit it out because it tasted totally spoiled. It was not edible and went straight to the trash. 

PLEASE pay better attention to the freshness of your food ingredients. I don't want anyone else to experience what I experienced. I really wanted to give 1 star but because I've never had an issue with the juice, I will give 2. However, I won't be coming back for food again.

________________________________________________________________________

UPDATE 9/30/16 - I received an 'On us' card for a future meal from Morgan of Grabbagreen. Nice gesture. I will stop by to try the food again and update/post a new review."}
{"text":"I've known about this place for a while but have never had the opportunity till jury duty came up.  I had the Patagonia bowl and it was delicious!  The chimichuri sauce is off the charts good, I had to go get more!!! So delicious and the staff is so friendly and helpful! I'll be here daily if I have to be in the area!!"}
{"text":"The Veggie Collard Wrap was wow!!!! So yummy. Tons of healthy options. I had the Green juice, hubby had the Energy. They were alright, but not the best I've had. The wrap was certainly a 5 star, but the juice wasn't as 'vegetabley' as I'd like."}
{"text":"Love this place! It has so many healthy options to eat for when I'm tired of eating greasy food. The smoothies are delicious and they do the trick. The bowls are also great and filling and you can always create your own. I love that there's actually one healthy place in downtown for me to choose from. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great selection of healthy items..everything from grab n' go juices, juices & smoothies, and nutritional snacks to quinoa and veggie packed entree dishes.

Friendly and fast service. Convenient spot downtown in Cityscape. A little expensive (I paid $10 for a salad) but you get a lot of salad for that price. I felt like I ate forever on it and by the time I threw it away it looked as if I'd barely made a dent. 

Will definitely return to try out additional menu items!"}
{"text":"Didn't eat here because when I asked how they cook salmon, they said it was steamed and they run it through twice so there's no pink. That's not how you serve salmon, so I went somewhere else.

Update: I received a reply to my post indicating that they do leave the salmon a little pink  inside but thats not what she told me when I wanted to eat there. The person went on to say they can cook it longer if you want but again that's not what I was told when I wanted to eat there."}
{"text":"THE BEST! Just in town visiting for the weekend.  This place has me sold. The GrabbaGrain options are filling! The smoothies are customizable which I loved! Ingredients are all listed.  That chili mango sauce I will try to replicate at home. Really added a nice kick to my meal. I felt great leaving with a full belly knowing I ate a healthy wholesome meal, however I was a little tempted walking out noticing the donut shop next door.  Takes some real discipline to walk past without leaving with a donut :)"}
{"text":"I've gone to Grabbagreen every day now since visiting Phoenix for a few days and love it. I lucked out as my hotel is across the street. I wish there was one in Pittsburgh! The food is healthy and light. I ordered the mango bowl and it was composed well with quinoa, brown rice, mango, pineapple, banana, granola, coconut, almond milk and chia. Some of the mango was more ripe than others but other than that it was very filling. I also had the Amazonian Whey as I wanted something protein heavy and wasn't feeling so great. It has banana, whey protein, cacao, hemp, water and agave - I was asked if I wanted to add peanut butter but I declined. The staff is really friendly - I am greeted each time I've gone in and am thanked for coming in after placing my order. The place is clean and there are a lot of tables and seats. There's also a water stand to get water from. I hope to be back to try some other things - everything on the menu sounds amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow the employees are exceptionally friendly and genuinely excited about the product. Their excitement, however, is misguided. 

Grabbagreen's motto is \"For the Health Freak in You.\" Then why do all of its smoothies contain agave, which contains more fructose than any other common sweetener, including high-fructose corn syrup? 

Check out the nutrition page on the Grabbagreen website. Looks like the steak and veggie collard wraps are among the only truly healthy items on the menu. The smoothie I bought this morning has 60 grams of sugar in it! That's more than double the recommended amount per day! 

The smoothie, however, was delicious. (How could it not be with all that sugar?) And I'll probably be back to try the food. 

These revelations don't mean Grabbagreen's products aren't tasty or better for you than other options out there. I just feel like I was lied to."}
{"text":"I've been here once for food, and more recently for juice. This place is located at the corner of Central and Jefferson. I'm sure there's some garage parking, but if you're looking for a quick stop for lunch, finding street parking close by might be tough. Given the current furnace we're in, you might only want to stop here if you're already in the area and within a very short walking distance. 

It's pricey. Food is a decent price, but the portions reflect the price. For a smaller appetite, it's more than enough, but if you're a little hungrier that day, the standard portions may not be enough. The juices are also pretty pricey given the size that you get. But, I suppose you have to factor in the location and all that. 

Food: I got an Asian beef bowl when I ate here the first time. The flavours were good, and the meat was tasty. It's a good choice if you're looking for something a little more satiating. 

Juice: We got the immunity booster and the gingerly. Word of advice: if you don't want your drink looking brown, don't get a watermelon-based drink and add kale. 

I've been wavering between a 3-star and a 4-star review. The reason I chose to gave it 4 stars was because of the service. The lady who was working there Thursday evening took the time to explain the menu and drinks to us, and gave us suggestions that were a little off the menu to customize it to our tastes. She brought us the drinks and checked up on us a little later to make sure everything was alright. I appreciate her, and I appreciate this businesses. 

If you're looking for a healthy boost to your day, this could be the place for you."}
{"text":"Want a healthy meal in downtown Phoenix? Yes, this is the place. This location is accessible for anyone who works in the downtown Phoenix area. Easy in, quick lunch, easy out. I've ordered the French Quarter once. The only problem I had with this plate was that it was very heavy on the onions. WOAH CRAZY BREATH. I had to run to the CVS next door to get some mints. 
I do like their Toyko Bay with their Spicy Mango sauce on the side. Everything here is really fresh and tasty.
I'll definitely be back to try some of their homemade juices."}
{"text":"I paid waaaay too much for a small about of food that was TRASH. The spinach is old, chicken is basically boiled. Idk how the hell they cooked the eggs. Overall expensive for absolutely no reason. If I had kid, this amount of food wouldn't be enough. Go to Mad Greens or Salad & Go instead for salads! Better, fresher options with more for less. And go to Nekter for juice because again, more for your money and even better quality.

Update: I also realized I didn't get one of the items I paid for on my salad"}
{"text":"Healthy food doesnt have to be bland and this place proves that. Love Grabbagreen, I work downtown so I am within walking distance and when its not surface-of-the-sun hot outside, I make the trek down to get my fix. I love the smoothies, I've had several and they let you substitute if you're not a fan of one of the ingredients (for me, banana- ick) plus they are reasonably priced for the amount and goodness that you receive. I really like the Looking Luscious and Feeling Fabulous ones - yumm!  I also love the bowls, there is an Asian one - Tokyo Bay- that is to die for with salmon and edamame and brown rice and other goodies. Seriously good and there is a TON in that bowl, looks can be deceiving on the packaging. Basically, check this place out - its healthy, fast, easy, and full of flavor!"}
{"text":"It's sad when you want to rate a place higher just because your city lacks healthy restaurant options.
With that said, this is one of those places. The food is okay, decent.....
but something about it is so lifeless. Oh, and slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"Grabba Green is a hip and healthy option in the heart of downtown.  Also, it's an ideal place to get some grub after hitting Eos or Orange Theory.  

Some of the bowls on the menu combines ingredients you would not expect, but they make the dishes fun.  Also, you can put together your own combinations. (just remember to add sauce otherwise it might come out bland, especially if you're not a healthy food eater on a daily basis.)

We went on a very busy night. Needless to say, the wait was pretty long, but the staff was friendly and patient. They even compensated us by giving a card for a free drink/meal. That's a free $10 meal. You can clearly see that the folks at Grabba Green care for their customers. They just want everyone to have a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Healthy, fresh, perfect options, gluten free, good service and amazing taste. This place satisfies the food snob in me and is affordable."}
{"text":"Food was very good--fresh and well flavored, but portions are fairly small, and will likely not fill you up, especially if you are hungry. Shakes are good as well."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy?! Amazing!  My mom and I stopped in before a basketball game on Friday night and had the place to ourselves. I had the Moroccan Mac & Cheese which was amazing and just the right amount of spicy.  Mom made a Grab Your Own salad.  The Creamy Avocado dressing was a bit spicy for her but she was happy with her second choice, the Mediterranean Pomegranate.  For being organic, I thought the prices were fair. The staff was friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place. And it's gluten-free!"}
{"text":"Staff is really knowledgeable about the menu and always suggesting different things based on your needs/cravings :)"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good, healthy smoothie place that doesn't have lots of added sugar in their smoothies. I was thoroughly impressed with this place. 

I got the \"fab & fruity\" which has coconut water, different fruits and agave. It was delicious! It also looked like they have a good selection of healthy breakfast, lunch and dinner options. Lots of vegan options too.

It was empty when I went in and I got my smoothie quickly. The staff was friendly. I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Okay, don't kick me in the groin for this mediocre review. 

My first trip to GrabbeGreen was orgasmic--I couldn't get enough of the French Quarter. It was one of those meals where you lick the box then take it out for a smoke. Yes, I'll admit the portions were small for my appetite, but maybe portion control is something I need to grasp. The second try was epically disappointing. The Moroccan mac and cheese with chicken. With a detox juice, because I'm mad about beets! Now, let me just put this out there: I make a wicked good mac and cheese. And it's probably a full 2,000 calories per serving. So, I'm particular about this dish. Let me also say that I don't like white meat. The marriage of this pasta with chicken breast just wasn't for me. At all. Dry meat and the spices were more on the sweet side. Hey, maybe I've never had a proper Moroccan mac and cheese and this is how it was supposed to be. But after nearly dropping a Jackson on this meal, I was left feeling empty. Like I was just dumped after ordering appetizers. 

I will be back. Definitely for the French Quarter. And for sure after my next bender to flush my system."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go for healthy food. I did a grab your own smoothie. I love e that you can create your own! For $7 you get a big smooth... I was surprised by the size. The staff was very nice and the smoothies were made pretty quick. I plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"YUMMY! This place is great. A bit pricey but delish! I had the Bourbon Street and it was wonderful."}
