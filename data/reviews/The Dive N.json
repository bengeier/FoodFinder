{"text":"My dad and I came here for breakfast.  It was actually really good at a great price.  We both got country ham, hashbrowns, scrambled eggs and a biscuit for $7.  Skip the biscuit though and get the toast.  Something is wrong with those biscuits.  They are hard and tasteless ... probably just warmed up from the grocery store freezer.  The ham was good and tasty, but greasy and the hashbrowns were great !"}
{"text":"Great little family owned place! We came for breakfast and left pretty full for a fraction of the cost of a big chain pancake place.
We have also grabbed lunch here and the sandwiches and fries were amazing! Getting out of the parking lot can be annoying because of the traffic...give yourself time!"}
{"text":"Best damn gyro ever!! Great customer service every time. I come here at least twice a month and feel welcomed and enjoy the experience always!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny hole in the wall diner, with limited indoor seating (they do have a covered patio, and outdoor tables). So, expect a crowd. There is an extensive breakfast/lunch menu on a large chalkboard, and you place your order at the register. We both ordered the grilled pimento cheese sandwich, which comes with fries. Sandwich was delicious... fries were decent, but a little undercooked for my liking. Inside is 50's style decor, and the staff is very friendly. I think I paid $5 and change for my meal - pretty inexpensive. I will definitely be back! I've heard that thus place was featured on the Food Network /DDD."}
{"text":"Love this place we go about once a month. One of the better burgers in town at a reasonable price. The fries are always hot and tasty. I have also gone to breakfast here a couple times and been impressed with the portions and quality. Good diner fare."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to get a burger, fries and a classic cherry coke.  It reminds me of a little burger joint I used to go to back when I was a kid.  The ladies working there are always amazingly nice, despite how busy it always is.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the hours are a little peculiar.  It always seems like we want to go here when they are closed, often times we would like to go for an early dinner on Saturday's but they close at 3 pm.  Never made it here for breakfast, but they open at 7 AM so it must be dang good.  Highly recommend this little local burger place!"}
{"text":"This is a good place just like the old drive-ins the burgers are good here the fries are good here. parking is normal you can find a spot."}
{"text":"Wonderfully friendly staff, loved them all. Got the Jimmy special, burger was huge and fries were warm and fantastic. Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the onion rings on my burgers were literally the worst onion rings I've ever had. Very bland, but I would come back for a good double burger any day!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I discovered The Dive-N when me and a friend were looking for a place to eat and somewhere we haven't been before. We stopped in and the place was pretty busy which is always good to see. The menu is filled with great options! Jimmy's burger is my favorite for sure! Also the price is really reasonable for fresh food. I go back here every month at least!!"}
{"text":"Very good simple lunch & sandwich place. Excellent chicken salad sandwich, good casual services. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The hamburger club sandwich? 0h, God, yes. The funnel cake sticks? Swoon worthy. 
This place is a true dive and has the great food that REAL diners make. So often now, people will make cheap food, outdated decor and call it an authentic diner. No. A true diner has people who love good food and want you to love it, too. They're not into giving you an experience or taking you on a culinary journey. They want you to roll your eyes in back of your head, moan orgasmically and leave them a $3 tip on your $6 lunch.
The $88 pp place with have you telling your friends about the shaved clam amuse bouchée. The diner will have you telling your friends that they HAVE to go there right how and try the ______ because it's to die for. 

You have to go there right now. It's to die for."}
{"text":"Great place for a low key breakfast!!!!

I have been here several times for breakfast and have been nothing but thrilled!!!! Order at the counter from a very large menu of choices. (might I suggest the liver mush omelet) I know how it sounds but I talked both of my parents (both of which had never had liver mush) in to trying it and they absolutely loved it! 

After preferring at the counter, hadn't a seat and your food will be delivered to you. 

After passing this place by numerous times, I must say that was a huge mistake and I was really missing out. Now, my next goal its making out there for lunch since they have kind of restrictive hours."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast it was great really no complaints it was a little packed as expected on the weekend. Ordered an egg breakfast also got a pancake on the side was thinking about getting two glad I didn't! Pancakes are huge nice and fluffy would definitely go back to try something else next time!"}
{"text":"Breakfast here is delicious! Eggs made on the spot, fluffy biscuits and when they ran out of grits just before our order, they made us some more and apologized for the short delay. Real grits too, because of course, no self-respecting southerner makes instant grits.

Very clean and waitstaff are friendly and prompt. Our only complaint was that the Dive N serves everything on Styrofoam or plastic. I would pay $5-10 more just to not add Styrofoam to the environment. Also the grits could survive with a bit less butter."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Got the basic cheese burger and it takes you back in time growing up. 
I would recommend this place to anyone. 
A must taste place. Onion rings are great too !"}
{"text":"I have been here for breakfast a couple times, it was really good both times. Definitely a great option in the Pineville area. The staff is friendly and helpful. I do think it's odd that they serve food on styrofoam plates, I know...it's a weird complaint."}
{"text":"Their burger is so good and reasonable priced. My new favorite burger spot!!!!! Staffs are friendly and good service."}
{"text":"Awesome, great food. Excellent, prompt service. I got the pimento burger all the way. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Pineville for breakfast and lunch. Good food cooked to order. The establishment itself has lots of character and charm. My favorite part is the counter staff.... The girls are friendly, consistent, and very fast. Great spot!"}
{"text":"This place has great prices and the food was very good too. They have a very large menu and allow you to order lunch at breakfast time. This is definitely a dive. The food is served on styrofoam plates with plastic silverware. But, it was delicious!  My only complaint is that for some reason they only allow one refill on fountain sodas. I don't understand this because fountain soda costs restaurants next to nothing. You are basically paying for the cup. So why not allow more than one refill?  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice diner.  Fast and friendly service.  We really enjoy the club sandwich and the cheeseburger is great also!  We have used take out in the past and they do a great job with that also."}
{"text":"Found this place when yelping a spot for my birthday lunch!  Nice serving size, super helpful staff and yummy food...win! I had the cheeseburger club with sweet potato fries, hubby had the gyro with fries and my sister had the fried bologna sandwich with onion rings. Cheeseburger club was very nicely done (hold the tomato for me) and sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly, needed salt and a dipping sauce option would be great too.  I tasted the gyro and it was good but not something I would normally order anyway, fries were standard fare. I don't eat bologna so i didn't try it, but the onion rings were thick and battered well. Yum! Sweet tea was true to it's name, though slightly pricey in my opinion at $1.75, although you could get it refilled constantly if you liked!  Seating inside is limited but outside seating is available too.  I would definitely go back and recommend it for.sure!"}
{"text":"My experience here was pleasant. Food was typical of a diner so you get what you want here. The burger I had was a bit too greasy for me but I'm sure there are folks who really like that. My parents and my son dined with me. We all agreed that The Dine N is a 3-star restaurant."}
{"text":"Just good greasy diner food. Casual atmosphere and pleasant staff. No frills deliciousness."}
{"text":"Great little place good food. Nice peps"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for years now and never stopped in. Mostly because the traffic in front of here is atrocious, but we finally gave it a try, and boy am I kicking myself for not eating here sooner! It was great! As I looked at the menu, I was shocked to see how affordable all the prices were. This is the kind of place you can eat regularly on your lunch break and not bankrupt your checking accont!
    I had the Chicken Chef's salad. It costed 7.25 and it was huge!! I was shocked that they put a half of a tomato on it as well as cheese, cucumber, half a boiled egg, and onions. It was piled high and deep and tasted so freah and crisp. The chicken was perfectly fried to a golden brown and cut into thin strips. It was also very tasty. The honey mustard dressing was delicious and they give you plenty!
   My frriend had just an old fashioned hamburger. It was so very big and costed 4.95! You could get double patties for only 5.75! I almost wished I had gotten that instead! The bun looked so fresh, almost bakery made, I do not know. They serve crinkle cut french fries, which I prefer, and they gave her a lot of them!
   They also give you a card when you order that has 10 stars on it. For every 5 dollars you spend, they card punch one star. After the card is completely punched, you get a free burger plate. I like little things like that from a rest6aurant. The staff was also super friendly and gave great service. Sadly, it is a small place and most of the seating is outside, but most is covered and ther are plenty on tables. 
   I know we will be going back alot! They have a large menu and I want to try so many of their specials and sandwiches! Great job Dive N!!!! I'LL BE BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place, there is a little out door area and they were okay with my dogs being out there with me. The people are all so nice, helpful and talkative. The pimento cheese burger was really good, and the fried pickles were yummy as well - just a bit salty. It's affordable and good!"}
{"text":"We just spent several minutes waiting in line, patiently waiting for our turn to order. A family came in several minutes after us and was immediately ushered to another cash register to order, completely ignoring our family in front of them in line. Apparently, if you're a regular your business matters more. We won't be returning and left immediately."}
{"text":"One of my favorites for weekend lunch! The food is always good and fresh. The staff is always friendly. French fries are crisp and the gyro, burgers and club sandwich are awesome! Simple. Fresh. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great little burger joint in Pineville. The burgers are big and greasy. The side are hefty in portions and the outside/inside seating is great for what it is. If you are looking for a burger joint, this is a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"One of the best diners around Charlotte.  The food is great and reasonably priced.  I highly recommend the double cheeseburgers and the club sandwiches. Haven't been here for breakfast yet, but they are usually PACKED!  They do have outdoor seating for warmer weather."}
{"text":"We were running early to pick up a u-haul for my move and decided to grab a late breakfast. This was a random place we saw and stopped in. The food was pretty good, very diner-esque. Service was pretty good as well. Honestly though it wasn't anything super special... I can see why they have a good regular following but the food itself isn't anything I can't make better at home. I was not thrilled with their grits and they tasted rather instant to me. They did have the little jelly packs from my 80's childhood and even had the mixed fruit one (basically apple and grape) which was always my favorite so that was a cool memory to bring back. Would I come here again? Probably not, it wasn't memorable enough."}
{"text":"It's a nice little diner. The food was just okay; the fries were deliciously hot though. I wasn't happy with the sweet tea; two people in our group ended up switching it out for a soda."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! They have the best lunch around!! The staff is always friendly and the food is always spot on! They also have the cutest little patio out front :)"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast!! Will come back here again and again. Fresh made ingredients make the difference."}
{"text":"Back to the Fifties!  Just need some poodle skirts and tight sweaters and guys with cigarettes rolled in their t-shirt sleeves and cuffed blue jeans.  A small, intimate interior with a four table or so outdoor patio with umbrellas.  Located just shy of the most awful intersection in Pineville, across the street from Rite Aid.  If you are driving fast you will miss it, so be in the right lane so you can make the turn.

A diner, so burgers, fries and fried foods.  A good selection on the menu and prices are reasonable.  My 98 yr old dad likes it as he can order a fried egg sandwich.  The people who work there are very flexible to substitutions or special requests.  Just remember that it is a grill and deep fry kitchen.

Decent burgers and lunch sandwiches and breakfasts are excellent."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places Charlotte for lunch. The staff is super friendly and attentive. I love that it is a mom and pop type place. Food is always good and great prices. I've had the fish and burgers. All were great."}
{"text":"This is my second breakfast visit after discovering on Yelp. Excellent food and friendly service. You can't beat $5.99 for two eggs (perfectly prepared), country ham (with extra cholesterol and high bp), grits (genuinely southern),  fluffy biscuit and coffee (eagerly refilled at your table). Atmosphere is quaint and nostalgic, quite rare in Charlotte area. Will definitely eat here again (Lord willing) and look forward to trying their burgers at lunch one day. In short, I highly recommend this hidden jewel in Pineville!"}
{"text":"We were treated to lunch at work, leaving us with the difficult decision of what to choose. Someone on our team recommended the Dive N. Checked out the reviews... of course. Got the Grill chicken sammich w/ sweet potato fries( kinda soggy) and a side order of funnel cake fries. The funnel cake fries are DELICIOUS!! You eat one and you will not be able to stop eating them. 

Would definitely get food from here again."}
{"text":"I always come here for breakfast but thought I might try it for lunch while my car is being cleaned. Fast service and a cute but small dining area inside. Nice sunny patio in front which was perfect for a warm October day."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Tried the cheeseburger & am looking forward to trying more off their expansive menu."}
{"text":"So, I have to be clear, it's 4 stars on pure goodness of divey-diner food. Great staff, cute hole in the wall place.. crazy huge menu. The fish and chips my mother loved with generous portions and I had the club which was completely picturesque. I will come back to try one of the 700 things on the breakfast menu as well. :)"}
{"text":"i love this place , i been there a few times  with my mom and so far what i get is awesome . They have a nice staff as well . I love the pasta salade , sweet potpo fries , there bugers . Evryhing is grate !!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 2 years now and always meant to write a review. I always get a burger and onion rings which is delicious as the other reviewers have said but they also have amazing service. The workers are always helpful and friendly every time we have gone. One example was the last time we went I forgot to ask for chili on my burger and when I went to the counter to add it was expecting to pay extra. They ran back to the kitchen, added it to my order and didn't charge me anything!"}
{"text":"The Dive N is a nice place in Pineville to go and get a nice, huge, greasy burger! This is a throwback diner complete with vinyl booths and old records on the wall. You order up at the counter and they bring your food out to you. 

I've only had the burgers here, but that will bring me back. They are seriously humongous and a great deal for the price. The burger I got came with 2 beef patties and was topped with 2 onion rings. It also had enough cheese so that it was oozing out of the sides. This is less of a gourmet burger place and more a greasy diner style burger so expect that. It will leave you wanting a nap afterwards. The fries are crinkle cut and were slightly above average with a nice crunch. The sweet tea was average and was not sweet enough for my liking. 

My favorite thing about the Dive N is the picnic tables out front. They are great to enjoy a meal on a nice day. They have no problem with bringing your food out to you after you order at the counter. It's a nice relaxing spot to have a meal. The inside is also nice. They've got a 50's diner theme and there is plenty of memorabilia from that time on the wall. There is a private parking lot so parking shouldn't be a problem. We went at around 11:00 so there wasn't much of a crowd, but as we were leaving the people started flowing in. 

The Dive N is a nice greasy spoon spot with a good atmosphere, friendly staff, and good diner food. I would go to enjoy a good burger on a nice day out on the picnic tables."}
{"text":"Dive N is a small restaurant with a very large menu !! The food is very good, staff is very friendly. Service is very fast! If you want some good comfort food then this is the place to be."}
{"text":"My local Dive!!! Been coming here since it's inception. The staff, food, service is spectacular. They know their regular customers which is amazing. It feels like home. Been in Pineville for 12 years and they have always made me feel welcomed.  Being the minority in Pineville...that is a huge blessing. Oh and their Funnel Fries????!!!!!! To die for. They are always a place I recommend to anyone. Just wished they stayed open later and open on Saturdays. That's the one downfall of such a great place which warrants the 4 and not 5 stars"}
{"text":"When we walked in (went for lunch break) we were greeted right away! We asked what was her favorite menu item, she said the burgers were what they are known for. So... of course we each got a burger! I got a regular hamburger with lettuce, mayo, tomatoes, and pickles (no onions for me!) it came with a side of fries as well. The food came out rather fast for being cooked when ordered. The burger was flat topped cooked (at least it seemed like it) and it was good!! The fries were a little too done for me, but I'm pretty picky about my fries. The vibe of the diner was nice and exactly what I expected. Everyone that worked there was so polite and friendly. We were checked on several times (even though you don't have a server). 

I will definitely be back, especially since I work two minutes away!"}
{"text":"Average.  Nothing special about the hamburgers, but were not bad.  Employee working the register not over friendly, but the one who brought out the meal was very nice."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous! My husband enjoyed the Jimmy's special and I enjoyed the fish sandwich. Great staff and friendly patrons!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here 3 times and every time the food has been delicious, and the service friendly and quick. A regular stop whenever we think of it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's only open for breakfast and lunch but it doesn't matter because it's ALWAYS packed. I usually get the Jimmy's special, if you like get burgers and are a first-timer I would definitely recommend it. They have a variety of other burgers and sandwiches though too, as well as blue plate specials? I think. If you want a good go-to lunch spot...this is it!"}
{"text":"Great burger - good substitute for a Wad's burger!!! 

Breakfast is really good too!  Wish they served dinner.

Staff is very friendly...   A very rare combo - friendly service, good food, decent price!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp! I really enjoyed the Dive N. not only was the food great but the service was the friendliest I have had in recent memory!

I was asked at least three of four times if delicious pulled pork BBQ was to my liking. The cole slaw was awesome and the Texas Toast and fries polished it off!

Wonderful place, can't wait for my next trip to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"Just as it says.. Dive n.. It's small, no frills, but packed during inch.. Packed bc it serves great food fast And the service is polite and they make you feel welcomed.. I love it!!"}
{"text":"I've got to say, this place has one of the best grilled chicken clubs I've had anywhere. Extremely reasonably priced (~$8) for a sandwich and fries and the portions are decent. Staff is friendly and know the menu well (important for someone like me who travels and is always checking out new places for the first time). The parking lot and inside of the restaurant are pretty cramped but I can't fault them for that. If the place sucked they'd have plenty of open tables and parking spaces; the fact that it's cramped just tells you how good the food is. I'm taking away a star because if you're going to charge for a cup of water, at least give the customer a bigger drink cup!"}
{"text":"Our daughter moved to South Charlotte last fall and this place is the restaurant we've been to the most.  We've had breakfast and lunch.  Both were great experiences.  I LOVED the grilled pimento cheese sandwich.  Seating is tight especially if the outdoor patio isn't available."}
{"text":"First visit.. Ordered club sandwich no tomato & no mayo w/ fries. Place was packed and lunch was served as requested and timely. Place has a good feel and awesome staff! Looking forward to a return visit..."}
{"text":"For the price I would say this place is pretty good! What I live the most is the service! Stefania is so attentive to refills and always have a smile on her face when greeting everyone."}
{"text":"My best friend and her boyfriend came down for a concert, the next morning we were looking for a place to have breakfast and stumbled upon the Dive N! I loved the atmosphere as soon as we walked in. The two ladies at the counter were very friendly and helpful! You have to order at the counter before sitting down. They have a variety of breakfast combinations! I ordered a breakfast sandwich on toast with egg, cheese and bacon, a side of hash browns and syrup. (I like to dip my sandwich in syrup to give it that salty sweet flavor...don't judge me) My friends got biscuits and gravy, eggs, hash browns with cheese and two sweet teas. (My friends boyfriend really loved how sweet the tea was) The food was great, along with the cute 50's decor! I'll definitely be back to try lunch!"}
{"text":"What more can you ask for from a local (non-chain) diner with a wonderful 50's theme?  
These guys are friendly, the facility is clean, the food is good and the prices are fair.

Although I am not a fan of places who serve fried fish because they use the same oil to fry their fries in but you may not care. 
The burgers are decent but not hand made which would really improve the quality.  

Try the brats or the fried chicken too!"}
{"text":"Huge lunch rush on a Friday and I was in and out of there. I always look for an American drive thru type. They remind me of growing up in Washington, NJ where we had Stewart's. the burger, dog and fries were delicious today. A big shout out to the whole crew there for running a well chaos-ed  hot spot."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pimento burger and fries, not a bad burger joint for a quick lunch, better than most. This was my second visit. 

Price is affordable, about $5.60 a burger. The burger itself isn't as seasoned as you'd hope, the flavor is in the cheese/sauce they place on top of the patty. 

The \"crinkled\" fries are a bit underwhelming, not much flavor, zero seasoning, but I guess that's what you'd except from an classic burger shop. You can combat that with their homemade ranch (guessing based on its style. Not the cheap dressing, but a decent dip for the fries.)

It's a themed diner which I can appreciate. Overall I'd say give it a go."}
{"text":"Great simple sandwiches that were quickly brought to the table.  We had the BBQ sandwich and fried chicken sandwich.   Both hit the spot.   Refills on our drinks, ladies working were walking around making sure everything was great.   So for fast food it has a nice relaxing vibe."}
{"text":"Quick service and family owned. The ladies are nice and friendly. The menu is very simple and to the point. I usually stick with the Gyro sandwich which is always delicious!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I loved it!! I will be back again. Went during lunch time on a Thursday and it was busy. You could tell this is a lunch time spot which is great. The service was very friendly. I had the Jimmy Special..which was a double cheeseburger with onion rings mustard and a special sauce comes with fries..it was amazing. The burger was fresh and not too greasy. I truly enjoyed this lunch!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food is great! We highly recommend eating here. I had the burger and my wife had the grilled pimento cheese. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant is actually \"The Dive N\".  I ate here for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised.  They only serve breakfast and lunch and they have daily specials for each.  The theme is that of a 50's style diner.

With some reservations I decided to try to the BBQ plate.  Once I ordered I thought for sure I had made a mistake because I know what good Q tastes like and I just ordered it from a 50's style diner.  That's usually a big no no!  As you can see from the pic of the plate it's a nice portion of food.  I was acutally impressed by the pulled BBQ!  It was very tasty and I was a fan of the vinegar based sauce that accompanied it.  The slaw was great, finely chopped just the way I like it.  Also the drinks they serve come with that really crushed ice which is a favorite of mine.  I don't know why more restaurants don't have that?!?!  The BBQ plate was $7.25 plus $1.25 for the drink.

The staff was very friendly and the restaurant area was very clean which is always a plus.  I will definitely be back here again to try some of their other menu items, but for first impressions I give them 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I have never been to this restaurant before, but a couple of my co-workers and I decided to take our lunch break here. There is plenty of parking (especially since there is an empty lot next to the building). Inside there is a little hallway before you place your order. There are not that many tables inside but there are plenty of tables on the patio! We were lucky because she was cleaning a table right when we walked in (the last one available).
I had a few questions about the menu since I have never been here before and the lady helping us was very informative and patient. I ended up ordering a turkey burger with the fried pickles as my side. 
We sat down and gabbed for a little, and it was not that long until our food came out (probably 10 - 15 minutes, but they were pretty slammed). The turkey burger was pretty good! Flavorful. It does not come with toppings, but you can add whatever you like to it! The burger was definitely filling, and I was not able to even finish my fried pickles! The pickles were thinly sliced and lightly battered (the perfect combo, if you ask me). They were delicious! I could probably just eat a basket of them and be completely happy with my lunch. 
The environment was welcoming and the staff is definitely friendly. You do not have a \"server\" here, but we were checked on a couple of times to see if we needed refills and to clean our baskets. It does have the \"diner\" nostalgia that draws in back to my childhood. The retro silver booths, and the Marilyn Monroe mural, and The Andy Griffith Show sign. 
I will DEFINITELY be back in for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"Good group of folks working hard to bring you a great meal, breakfast or lunch! Sandy is probably one of the nicest restaurant owners in the area! You're always greeted by smiles and a large smorgas - menu - board of delicious options that'll make you Dive N face first.

They offer a punch card perfect for the repeat customer. 

D(r)ive N and see them today!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and I'm glad I did! The staff and owner here are super friendly. Me and my husband got two burgers with fries and onion rings, chili dog and a sweet tea for about $20 bucks. 

I got the pimento burger and it was good. Fries were crispy and not too salty which I like. Their onion rings are delicious. Not that greasy too. My husband got the club burger and he liked it. The hot dog was good. The chili on top of it added a nice touch. Their sweet tea was on point. 

I would definitely come back here again! I might try the fried chicken or sloppy Joe next time."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service even when they were super packed on a federal holiday. The onion rings and sweet potato fries were especially good."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast an lunch , I had breakfast with a friend an ordered the Canadian ham oh wow it was as big as my plate. Best hash browns nice an browned just as I like them.  They do a great business in Pineville, the owners are wonderful. For lunch stop by  an try the Jimmy special burger dont have any breakfast so you can finish your burger lol"}
{"text":"Being from NY I was exited to find a diner in the area. Went during lunch on a weekday. 

Location: was super difficult to get to coming from the south with traffic. And parking was almost so impossible, I almost gave up. Tight spaces, not many of them and lots of potholes. Finally grabbed a spot as someone was leaving. 

Inside was very mom and pop which I actually prefer. They have a small patio it decided to stay in due to the loud traffic. They have a wall up counter where u order and pay. Was debating a burger but ended up ordering chicken tenders with fries and a water, paid the $10 and grabbed a booth. Was pretty busy. Lots of pick up orders. Most tables were full. Staff behind the counter was pretty friendly and helpful.

Took 22 mins to get my order. And sad to say that the food was pretty disappointing. Chicken was dry and flavorless. Fries weren't my favorite. BBQ sauce and ketchup were very basic. I actually didn't want to finish the meal nor take it with me. And tenders are usually my safe food when I go to a new quickie joint. 

Overall I most likely won't go back based on this experience. The food doesn't come close to making fighting the traffic worth it. And for $10 and I can much better quality food at a dozen places close by. Both the food and condiments were obviously the cheapest they could get, but priced for higher quality food. 

So still on the search for a NY style diner."}
{"text":"Old time feel, but great place to eat.  Had the Jimmy special.  Wow!  Monster burger!  Definately will be back."}
{"text":"OMG. Beautiful staff...and they are friendly as hell. Come by to refill your drink for you..burgers and sandwiches are awesome...low on seating on a rainy day though."}
{"text":"It appears to be a good place to eat by the line but unfortunately the food is not that good, had the Burger special the meat was not taste at all, fries had been sitting around for a long time, the hot dog bad, I could get better one from a street vendors, charging for more than one refill, really, wait staff are extremely busy and friendly... Hope the can bring the quality up"}
{"text":"I recommend the Cheeseburger Club sandwich. It's definitely way better than you think. Also the Potato Salad is very good. It's like it has a little Cole Slaw mixed in it to get that extra touch."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I eat at dive n very often. Their food is great. I highly recommend the potato salad. It has a yellow color and tastes slightly mustard based. It goes great with their huge sized burgers. Make sure you are really hungry if you order the double burger. The best part of going to the dive n is the staff. They are so friendly. They always remember their regular customers by name. It seems like they really appreciate your business and want to make you happy. They are also very fast to refill your drinks and clear away plates. Definitely give this place a try if you are in Pineville. They have a huge menu so everyone should be able to find a dish they enjoy. They also always have daily specials."}
{"text":"I loved their food and people are really friendly. I am definitley going back there again."}
{"text":"Really cool, little place. I had a chicken club piled high with fried chicken, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. Delicious! Baldie had the cheeseburger. Pretty run of the mill and a little cold. My Crinkle cut fries were perfect, tho. Cheap eats in a divey little place. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice and small dive in place where the people are nice and the food is really good.  My only complaint is that I wish this place was bigger.  During lunch time, it's hard to get a seat.  My favorite items on their menu is their special burger, their hot dogs and their funnel fries.  And you can smell the funnel fries from outside.  The smell just lure you in."}
{"text":"I had a solid experience at the Dive N... They serve breakfast and lunch and close at 3 pm... 

I stopped by for lunch and ordered a standard cheeseburger with fries... I loved the décor of the place... A cool, retro vibe with 50's style diner interior and even some of that aluminum siding stuff on the side of the counter... I found some snazzy murals on the wall of Elvis and Marilyn and they have some funny little caricatures of the staff as well... 

Outside, they have a covered patio area and an additional area with picnic tables and umbrellas instead of an actual cover... It'd be perfect for a nice day with no wind... 

If you're addicted to condiments, you should know they have their sauce game on lock...  Most places charge for additional condiments now, but at the Dive N, you are charged for additional condiments or sauces that don't \"come with\" your meal... So if you like a weird combination, you might have to pay a little extra... It's .45 cents, so it's not too bad... 

The service was good... Since I didn't know much about the place, the person working the front desk gave me suggestions and was very pleasant...

The food was decent... I ordered the cheeseburger with chili, cheese, slaw and mustard... Since I got it to go, I had it with light toppings and they did a great job with that... The fries were still nice and crispy by the time I got home, so that was great... It was a good lunch... I'll probably go back if I'm at the mall or something, but it didn't bowl me over or anything..."}
{"text":"Quaint little diner nicely decorated.  Breakfast and lunch menu.  You can order from either.  9 tables and an outside area.   Order when you come in as I went and sat down and had to go back to order.  

Very friendly and nice staff.  Food was out within 5 minutes of ordering, was hot and fresh with a very good portion.  Had the 2 eggs and liver mush,  comes with toast or biscuit, grits or hash browns.  $4.75

Plenty of parking and just an awesome little diner to stop at.  Would definitely come back when on this side of town."}
{"text":"Dive n is a true dive. Food is alright. I had a cheeseburger, nothing special. A burger is a burger unless it is the speciality at the restaurant. Sweet potato fries are good and the sweet tea is alright. May return."}
{"text":"So I don't live in Charlotte, but my parents do... Not knowing where to get good food is why I turn to Yelp. 

I was starved post run and on my way to pick up my mom from work. I checked out places that were near by me so I didn't just go with a natal chain like Panera, Chipotle, etc....

After reading a few reviews here I decided to check it out. 

Walking in you order quickly at the counter, they move through the propel very quickly (as if they were the AM Dunkin Donuts counter in Boston... Sorry back to this review...)

The food selection is such that you should probably go with their specialities ... Burgers, Chicken, BBQ. I went with a Gyro (one of the reviews mentioned it). 

It was a pretty warm day for December, and so I elected to sit outside on the heated patio. They quickly brought out my food. Which was very good and the fries exactly how I like them. 

I definitely would return for breakfast and even lunch. I'm definitely a fan!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband for breakfast this weekend and was pleasantly surprised.  You order at the counter, but there is table service after you place your order.  The staff was very friendly and food was quite good!  Prices were reasonable.  Typical breakfast fare:  eggs, grits, hashbrowns, livermush, biscuits and gravy etc.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very good food excellent prices and the people were so attentive and friendly. Try the junkyard breakfast it was sooo yummy!  And if you like grits, they do them right!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This are seriously some mighty good on onion rings. Oh and the pork was awesome for the price. I was only mad I had no more stomach space to put more food in me.."}
{"text":"I love The Dive N!  It's one of my favorite places in South Charlotte to go for lunch!

The employees at the front counter where you order are always very nice and helpful when you just can't decide on what to order.  The restaurant is really clean and has a very kitschy, retro vibe to it.  You place your order when you walk in and then find a place to sit.  It's a kind of small restaurant so I suggest you get there early if you are going during the lunch rush!  The employees are always walking around making sure you have everything you need and making sure your drink is always topped off!

One of my favorite sandwiches there is the fish sandwich.  The fish is fried, but not too heavy.  It's very tender and flakey and served on a big bun.  They also put Cole slaw on it which I think is fantastic!  It's super yummy!  Their fries are always my choice side because they're awesome!  They are the crinkle cut style and they are always hot and fresh!

I've also tried their burgers and gyro and both are also good!

Give The Dive N a shot, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Long line out the door was the first indication that this greasy spoon would be on point!  Actually, that's not true, the YELP ratings were the first sign. 

Even with the line (very busy lunch time), we got a table immediately, the line moved fast and the food came quick.  Staff is very friendly.  

Got a burger and fries and friend got chicken tenders I believe.  All were very good."}
{"text":"The owner is awesome, very smiley and helpful she genuinely seems to love her job, which makes you want to come back. I was impressed by the burger. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger I didn't see it on the menu but they made it. The burger was juicy and it was messy. My hands smelt like burger for hours even after washing then lol. I want to go back and try their breakfast which I may do today. Their menu was larger then I expected. But I went for a burger so that's what I got. My coworkers raved over the funnel cake fries but I didn't taste them, they said they were addicting. I'd defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Good solid greasy spoon/diner food. Fun atmosphere and outdoor seating. The staff is always happy and friendly. They have a surprisingly large breakfast and lunch/dinner menu. The burgers are good and fries are crispy."}
{"text":"Fantastic 'greasy spoon food' but it's no greasy environment. Clean as a whistle and yummy!"}
{"text":"Classic American diner/dive. Love this place so much.  Friendly and fast service. It's everything you want and love about short order flat top food.

They will make it how you order it, which is a major plus for me. We got to go breakfast and everyone was happy and full after. I ordered a livermush sandwhich on rye with chili, mustard, onions and slaw with a slice of tomatoe and a poached egg on top and it really hit the spot. I ordered it half-heartedly not expecting it to actually be made, but believe it or not they did it to a tee. I was very happy with it. I LOVE livermush and the poached egg was done just right and it was massive. I've overlooked this place in the past but now it is probably going to be a regular breakfast spot for me in the future."}
{"text":"It isn't fancy but dang, it sure is good. Fluffy pancakes. Quality sausage and nicely scrambled eggs. Coffee is standard. Super friendly staff. Oh and the old rock and roll just tops it off. Great way to start the weekend!"}
{"text":"The only reason for 4 stars is the lack of seats. The food and service are 5 stars all the way. This is a jewel of a place! One of those tucked away places that you happen across that has a great menu where everything we ordered was awesome- even the pickiest eater in our party devoured her food. (Our 6 year old grilled cheese connoisseur) the chicken fingers were flavorful and crisp on the outside. My sloppy joes had a heat to them and my husband loves the philly. This may be a new favorite. 

The food was great and the service was good too. They kept circulating asking if we needed anything. Not bad for counter service."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed when I ate here w my co workers. The burgers were super greasy but the onion rings were decent, but I could have used more than four large pieces. I am close by but won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great location, tucked away off of a main road in Pineville. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is relaxed, the coffee is hot and is some of the best I've had. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place has great southern style diner food. Think chili cheeseburgers, hotdogs, fried chicken. It reminds me of the Clock back in South Carolina which makes me feel at home.

I love the cheeseburgers and hotdogs, and the homemade onion rings are amazing! Also the price is very cheap, you can actually get a burger and fries cheaper here than any fast food joint. And it tastes WAY better!

The service has always been great and everyone is really nice. The food comes out quickly as well. 

The location can be a pain since it can get busy in that spot, but that's a minor inconvenience for great food."}
{"text":"I was just coming from the post office thinking I need to stop for lunch and figured I'd end up at Subway then I looked to my right and saw this place.  I remember a review in the Charlotte Observer and thought I'd give it a try.  So I put the car in reverse and pulled in the parking lot.

I think the place used to be an ice cream joint and it is small.  On the inside there are about 10 retro-style tables.  On the walls are old records and 50's and 60's memorabilia.  They have a small covered patio outside with ceiling fans and then picnic tables with umbrellas out in the sun in front of the patio.

The menu is on the wall written on a chalkboard.  It has breakfast and lunch items.  The breakfast looks interesting and I'll have to try that sometime.  For lunch, the menu consists of quick lunch fare - burgers, sandwiches, maybe a salad in there.  Nothing fancy.  There are daily specials for both breakfast and lunch.

I was greeted instantly as I walked in the door.  There were about 5 women working the front of the restaurant.  The order taker was very helpful in suggesting a special.  So I went with Jimmy's Special which was 2 burgers with cheese, onion rings on top, with a special sauce and fries.  Drink was $1.  

It came out about 10 minutes later.  It was big.  The first thing I tasted was yellow mustard.  Was this part of the special sauce?  I wasn't complaining.  I love yellow mustard especially on a burger so I was quite happy even if I couldn't figure out the special sauce.  Anyway, the burger was good.  It was big and came with crinkle cut fries.   Nothing fancy on the food but sometimes that's all I need.  Simple can be great as well as long as it's cooked well.

And the service itself gets 6 stars from me.  The women were constantly asking if everything was ok or if I needed a refill on my drink.

Just beware if you go...if it's busy and it's too hot outside, there will be people hawking over your table just ready to pounce the instance you stand up to leave."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. BLT was made with bacon that had been sitting around someplace and was barely reheated. Sloppy joe was okay, nothing spectacular. 

Way too crowded and at 40-50 degrees they were actually seating on the patio. A bit chilly for my taste but others seemed okay with it. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"There's a reason people are lined up out the door! The food is excellent and the staff is friendly. This might just be my new favorite spot for lunch. It's also cheap. We fed our family of five for less than it would have cost us to eat at McDonalds!"}
