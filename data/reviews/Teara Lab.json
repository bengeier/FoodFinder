{"text":"Good spot for lunch. Their sandwiches are unique and really big portions. The best thing though was the passion fruit green tea drink. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I just stopped by here and the experience could definitely be much better. To get this out of the way first since I don't want this negative review to be all bad as I see potential in this store, the food is quite tasty. However, the place just opened and it is clear that staff are over-whelmed.

I stopped by for lunch and ordered a pork belly sandwich, which I was quite excited to try out. At the cashier, it was on the slow side, but nothing unreasonable. The staff are learning the system, so I can expect confusion at times. I noticed that there were a few times when the cashier had to double check things with other staff. After order, the place was starting to fill up, but luckily I was able to grab a seat at the last remaining table. 

I quickly realized that the ordering/serving process has not yet been established properly. It seems like everyone is asked their name and some people are given an order receipt with an order number. The food comes out and sometimes a name is called, other times a number is called, but the common issue I saw a lot while sitting there is that many customers had no idea what number they are and the servers aren't able to figure out where to place the orders. So I wait for a while, talk to one of the staff, and by this point, they are flustered and don't really have a great handle on the backup of orders. I tell them my situation, they confirm and I continue my wait. I eventually get a teriyaki chicken burger in front of me, as the server runs off before I realize it isn't what I ordered. Given how much confusion is already going on and the backed-up line they have of people waiting to order (which I must have seen waiting there for at least 10-15 minutes), I figured I'll just have a chicken burger and chalk it up as a bad experience. It's unfortunate I didn't get the pork belly as I was quite looking forward to it. My friend got the pork belly and he was pretty happy about it. I debated pushing to get what I ordered, but I figured it would take another 20 minutes to get my order and it would just make things so much more hectic than it already was for the struggling staff.

In all, I think the food is tasty and the place could be a pretty good joint if they figure out a better system to take orders and deliver the food. Consistency is key, and the new staff need to get a process down that they can stick to. I realize it just opened and that will attribute to the poor service, but they really need it to be better to handle the heavy traffic they can expect at their location. This is the summer time, so they have a few months to get things right before the hoard of UofT students come back and really start to strain their process."}
{"text":"came here with my wife and had the fish burger while she had the kalbi burger with yam fries. the fries were really good as was the fish albeit very messy with the sauce constantly running out. the kalbi burger was okay  slightly tough. 

yam fries were awesome 

overall would come back again and try another sandwich."}
{"text":"Teara Lab is a Japanese burger fusion concept joint on college across from university of Toronto. While they may have creative and unique burgers, they still need some work.

Came here with high expectations but was unfortunately disappointed. I ordered the chicken teriyaki and although there was nothing wrong with it per se, I just didn't find it very good. It was dark meat (as I would expect), and very greasy. My biggest takeaway from this place was how greasy it was. I was still thinking about the grease on a chicken burger, and where it came from. I also had asked for no mayo and my burger came with it. I left dissatisfied and haven't had the urge to return since. At least the size of the burger was good - definitely a big burger.

I gave them a second shot and ordered the braised beef sandwich. I was very disappointed by it. Not only was it very small, the beef wasn't soft, and it was quite salty. Overall, just not an appetizing sandwich, and I left hungry. Luckily I had gotten this for free with their current ongoing offer.

After giving them another shot, I don't have the urge to return. 

Overall, Teara Labs offers a unique concept but with poor execution."}
{"text":"3.5/5.

We had the teriyaki fish burger combo($11.99) and teriyaki chicken($11.49) combo.  Combos come with fries and a pop.  You can add $1.50 to change to specialty drink and add extra $2 for yam fries or asian slaw

Both were above average burgers.  Lots of ingredients and sauce mixed quite well together with the meat/fish.  Fries were okay(nothing speical, but not bad either).

Worth a visit"}
{"text":"First time I came by, there was a piece of paper saying they were closed for a few days. Tried my luck the week after and was finally able to try these Japanese fusion burgers. Glad I came again to try as it's quite unique and tasty. 

Decor/service:
Very nice upscale modern atmosphere. Not a huge space though, around 5 small tables. The service was very good. They were able to explain the burger types and give recommendations. 

Food:
Had a combo and chose the teriyaki chicken burger with yam fries. The teriyaki chicken burger was very flavourful and filling. The yam fries were okay, but next time I won't upgrade since it didn't make me want more. My friend had the soy glazed pork belly sandwich and she loved it. Perhaps I'll try that next time. The passion fruit green tea was very refreshing and unique. Definitely want to come back to try more."}
{"text":"Lack luster. There was a huge hype over this burger joint so my friend and I decided to pop in and give it a try. We got the teriyaki fish burger and am I glad that we decided to share one instead. Not really sure what I ate to be honest... I think it was fried fish with teriyaki sauce between black squid ink buns and toppings. Felt like my fish was soggy. 

Don't think I'd be coming back. I rather spend my $10 getting three street meat."}
{"text":"This is the first of its kind in Toronto! The food is very tasty. The food here have bold flavors that work well together. Most of the food is very savory. Also they use fresh ingredients. some of the food, in my opinion, is too big to fit in your mouth, it's still fun to try :P

The servers were friendly, helpful and provided a good amount of info on everything.

It's very pleasant inside, it's big enough to seat, roughly, 15 people. The decor is upscale and modern."}
{"text":"Came here for an early lunch with a co-worker. At around 11:20 there was only one other person there so it was fairly quick for us to get lunch. They have a very interesting menu with great sounding burgers and drinks! 

Ordered: pork belly sandwich and yuzu fish terriyaki burger. Wanted to try the Japanese curry pork but they said their pork cutlet wasn't ready. 

Yuzu fish terriyaki - this is a fairly big burger, with a beautiful big, piece of perfectly cooked fish (baked, not fried!). It is served with lettuce, tomatoes, fried onions, a yummy sauce on a squid ink bun. The flavours were fresh and kept me full without being a super heavy meal.

The pork belly sandwich was seriously good! kimchi and seaweed were strong, well balanced flavours. Very impressive (and wish I had more bites from my co-worker!) 

I found the staff helpful and courteous and the service to be quick. The reason for 4 stars only is the amount of french fries given is very small. They were good, not great. But I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0

New burger and sandwich shop owned by the folks from Kaka All You Can Eat. 

Teriyaki Chicken Burger - Chicken was tender and moist. There is a subtle presence of wasabi in the mayo which gives it a very light kick which works well for most folks. The bun used also held up quite well with the amount of ingredients and condiments that sits in between. Overall it was decent but could kick this up a notch if there was something else in the mix to cut through the creaminess of the mayo.

Soy Glazed Pork Belly - Flavourful but almost coming off as a bit too salty for my taste. It was definitely a heavily loaded sandwich which got quite messy while eating it as the hot dog bun did not hold up as well as the burger bun. The texture of the pork was not as tender and juicy as Bahn Mi Boys.

Tried the Hokkaido Milk Tea and it was way too sweet. Did not ask whether they have sugar levels customizable for your drink.

Service and ambience at this place is fairly nice. It is worth a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Concept , food , service , price . Japanese sandwiches are a great concept, allows you to have traditional Japanese cuisine on the go. With a variety of sandwiches such as short rib, pork belly, pork tonkatsu, you are bound to find something you like. 

Found this lil gem just passing by during their soft opening. Decided to give it a try. Had the Kalbi shortrib sandwich and it was delicious! The rib was soft and tender, generously marinated and seasoned with rich flavors. Great toppings, nicely saut√©ed onions and fresh sauce. I also like the chewy texture of the bun. It was a bit small for the price though, maybe just a bit bigger would be satisfying. 

Also tried the matcha milk tea and it did not impress, just seemed very regular like you would get at any bubble tea shop. Can't really comment on it since I have frequented Tsijiri. Night and day. 
I would definitely be back to try other fusion treat, I actually wanted to try the pork tonkatsu, seems like their menu change all the time."}
{"text":"I am not a sandwich girl but their kalbi sandwich kicked me hard it is so good.  I pretty much inhaled it.  Great place to grab a delicious lunch sandwich!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Teppanyaki Teriyaki Chicken Burger.  It was piled high with tomato, shredded lettuce, and a big juicy chicken patty.  This was so delicious!  The wasabi mayo really gave the burger a delicious kick. 

I absolutely loved their yam fries!  I am not usually a huge fan of sweet fries like sweet potato fries as I prefer fries to be salty, but these yam fries were seasoned perfectly, fried nicely, and tasted so good!  I couldn't just eat one!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try this new joint because of the innovative dishes we heard about. We were not one bit disappointed. Although the science and lab elements of this place were new and refreshing experience, the best points of this restaurant are the dishes. We ordered the Red Wine Braised Beef Sandwich and Soy Glazed Pork Belly Sandwich. Additionally for an extra $2 you can get a milk tea specialty drink and a fairly large order of fries! Good bang for your buck! Onto the food, the braised beef was flavourful and tender. With nice caramelized onions, it was quite good. However, the pork belly was the one that really knocked off my socks. The complementation of succulent pork belly, punch of kimchi, sharpness of nori, and sweetness of the glaze went so well together!  

I would definitely recommend this place for anyone interested in some new fusion sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I tried the chicken teriyaki burger and I was a fan! Its really tasty and the flavors mix well. I definitely want to come back and try out more! The service was a bit slow (but to be fair, there were only 2 people working)."}
{"text":"I went to this place with friends on a saturday night, was expecting something new and unique to toronto, and really did get it here. I had ordered the Pork Belly Burgers with yam fries, and it was definitely good. it was very filling as a burger, and had a lot of materials inside the kimchi mix with the pork belly sweet sauce was a good combination. It is pretty new to the toronto food scene to have a japanese fusion burger. It is a nicely renovated good food casual place to hang out with a few friends, and very relaxing, the place is not very big as it can only fit around 20 people. but on a weekend night it is pretty quiet so should have no problem ordering burgers and such. 

i would recommend people to try it out and have a shot at the burgers, as their are not a lot of to choose from to keep the menu simple."}
{"text":"Teara Lab recently opened up near University and College, and hearing that it offered \"Japanese-fusion sandwiches\", I was immediately intrigued and had to give it a go.

The food menu is spartan, in a really good way, offering six unique sandwiches or burgers. We wanted to try almost everything, but we settled on the teriyaki chicken burger, yuzu teriyaki fish burger, soy glazed pork belly sandwich, and red wine braised shortrib sandwich. We also grabbed a lemon dada (lemon and green tea, with a whole honkin' lemon in the drink) and an Okinawan Milk Tea.

The sandwiches at Teara Lab are great: unique twists using Japanese ingredients and flavours that provide real pop with every bite. I found that the yuzu teriyaki fish burger was the least delicious of the bunch; offering a visually intriguing look with its black hamburger bun, but not offering much in terms of flavour or texture. My personal favourites were the pork belly and the shortrib, both served in a hot dog bun, and both incredibly well cooked and well made. It was a bit tough to finish four sandwiches between two people, but we gave it a go.

Overall, we had a great experience at Teara Lab: it offers something new in the Toronto food scene and it would be great to see more unique takes on Japanese ingredients and flavours in sandwiches. 

I'd love to go back and try the last two sandwiches that we didn't have room for."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends to try out this place and was not amazed by the food. Most of my friends ordered either the fish, chicken or pork belly and we quite pleased. I, on the other hand, chose the road less traveled and picked the braised beef combo with regular fries and watermelon juice.

Just a warning that I'm not a fan of bread so when I saw the braised beef with lots of toppings on a long bun, I started to get utensils and focused on the meat and toppings. I had high expectations on the beef and felt it was not the wow factor that I was hoping for.  

Although I understand that the braised beef is not the normal kind in stew since it is a burger, I preferred more sauce and fattiness. The fries were a bit on the salty side with a touch of pepper. The watermelon juice was good but make sure you get the larger straw cuz I finish the liquid but ended up with lots of pulp at the end. I needed to add water so it seemed like I got a second cup.

The staff were friendly and super helpful. The decor is simple but classic. Service needs to be a bit faster especially if there are lots of customers. I heard that they will offer a salad option so I may return to try it out. I will try the fish and chicken as my friends recommended it."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and I think I can finally write an appropriate review of Teara Lab..It's across from U of T campus and does add a little bit more variety to the usual campus food you'd find around here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Overall, the price doesn't justify the quality of the sandwich; the place does have nice decor but I don't think I would come back here again because of value...A meal here can set you back $14-20 and you might leave feeling unsatisfied or worse, hungry!.

I came here with the BF and I was genuinely bummed that I wasn't able to try the other burgers other than the Yuzu Fish Burger and the Teppanyaki Teriyaki Chicken Burger because new supplies hadn't been acquired yet for their food (someone broke in a week-ish after their opening)

The squid ink bun of the fish burger hadn't been toasted to an acceptable temperature so it was cold up against the warm basa filet. I liked the overall flavour profile of the sandwich which was topped with lettuce, tomato, herbed mayo, bacon, cheese, crispy onions and yuzu teriyaki sauce. I will agree with another Yelper and say that both the fish and chicken were soggy =(

What stood out to me was the wasabi mayonnaise of the Teppanyaki Teriyaki Chicken Burger and the taste combo it shared with the cheese and onions. 

I don't know if it's me, but the fries served here taste like freezer burn albeit, well seasoned! 

Sorry Teara Lab, your beautiful white marble & gold decor just isn't enticing enough for me to come back as a regular."}
{"text":"Great meal! Terriyaki burger and fries were delicious. My friend had the fish burger and she said she'd come back for more"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Says its open at 11 , came at 12:16 and it wasnt open. Callled numerous times and no one picks up"}
{"text":"Tried: pork belly sandwich (~$10 by itself), a yuzu fish burger (~$9 by itself), fries, yam fries (with wasabi mayo), mango creama, and passion fruit green tea with aloe vera.

Highlights: wasabi mayo with yam fries & mango creama 
Not so good: buns ( too fragile) and fries (soggy and dry...)

This newly opened Japnese inspired sandwich shop is located right across from UofT. Same owner as Kaka all you can eat sushi place in uptown. They only have five different types of sandwiches/burgers and three sides to choose from. The price ranges from (~$9 up to $14 per sandwich and burger) and you need to pay extra to make a combo. Love their drinks! there are unique drinks you can't get anywhere else but here. Strongly recommend creama menu! 

I would come here more often if I live near the place. I don't think this place is worth to make a special trip as there are better sandwich/burger joints throughout the city. Yes, it is different that their food is inspired by Japanese cuisine, but I don't see myself craving for them nor wanting to have over and over again. No matter how gourmet sandwich/burger are, I still consider them as a quick bite, not as a proper meal if I am ordering at the counter. It is a bit on a pricey side because you have to spend at least ~$14 to be full. 

Their squid ink buns fell apart as I was working on my fish burger. It was dry and had that mushy texture to it once it absorbed the sauce... And the fries were soggy. Wish it was easier to eat pork belly sandwich because the taste was there. The pork belly was a bit too thick and chewy which made it harder to eat the sandwich. 

Overall, if you are in the area, give it a try, especially their drinks!"}
{"text":"Coming here, I didn't know that the store just opened but when the person taking my order informed me that I could get a free drink, I was ecstatic. I got the Okinawa Milk Tea with Lychee Jelly (they didn't have any Tapioca) and the Tonkatsu Pork Burger, small but delicious and flavourful. It was an interesting combination of pork belly, kimchi, seaweed, and lettuce; definitely things that I wouldn't think to put together but were nonetheless delicious. However, my sandwich became soggy as I ate so the last couple bites weren't enjoyable.  

The customer service was great but very, very slow. It took a really long time for me to get my sandwich even though the store was nearly empty. However, all my questions were answered with patience and my friend was also urged to get a free drink, even though she didn't buy anything."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon and figured I'd check this place out since it was close to campus.  Not sure what I was expecting, but I got the teppanyaki teriyaki chicken burger combo (with fries and I paid a bit more to substitute the can of pop for a specialty drink).  I thought the design of the interior was a bit awkward since I walked in and wasn't sure whether the people standing around were in line to get their orders taken, or were waiting for their orders...

Took a little bit to realize that if you order-in, the staff bring the order to you at the tables (I was awkwardly hovering and one of the staff members told me to sit down since I chose to dine-in).

The burger was ok, didn't think it was anything out of this world.  My problem was that the bun fell apart really quickly (not your typical burger bun) so it made it really messy to eat.  The wasabi mayo added a nice kick to the burger.  Didn't really think the fries were that special.  The drink I got was the classic milk tea and it was sort of bland/watery (not enough tea flavour, I think).

Overall, the meal was ok, a little bit more expensive than I thought it'd be but for the first time, it was all right."}
{"text":"I had high hopes here, even though I checked out the menu before and alot of the burgers are sort of sweet.

I asked the cook which burger was less sweet, he suggested the chicken terriyaki.  I asked if it was white or dark meat.  White meat he said.

Cashier was friendly...Made it a combo for $2 more which came with fries and a drink.  I asked for no salt on the fries.

It looked good when I received it, fries were good.  But I thought I saw on pics here that it had some herbs.  Mine didn't have it and I noticed other diners didn't have any type of rosemary on them either.  Granted, the cashier was removing rosemary from the stems...

Burger was greasy, and messy.  Oh, and it was dark meat I'm sure.  I ended up using a fork and knife and ate the rest, threw away the soggy bun at the end.

On the menu it says yam fries are coming soon, but on here some people have had them based on the photos on here."}
{"text":"Food: good
Service: really good

Teara Lab has a good selection of Japanese sandwiches, and it's the first time I've tried them. They're around $10+ each, and although this restaurant is across from U of T, it definitely attracts an older crowd (not many students when I went). The interior design is very contemporary, and I recommend eating in house (because it looks nice and because sandwiches are better served on plates than in bags).  Beware though, there wasn't a whole bunch of seats available... I believe there were six tables. On my visit, I got the red wine braised beef sandwich, and the wait time took around 10 minutes. When I got my order it turns out they had placed it wrong and I was given a fish sandwich instead. I had to reorder my original order (where I paid the difference), but they were kind enough to give me the fish fillet sandwich anyway. The employees dealt with the situation really well and I was impressed with the restaurant in it's soft opening. In terms of the sandwich itself, the portioning was satisfactory and the flavours were strong. I guess red wine braised beef isn't my thing, but my lunch buddy got the pork belly (I took a bite) and that one was FANTASTIC. 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Their sandwich menu is short, but they all sound tasty and it's hard making a decision just to choose one!

I had the soy glazed pork belly and overall it was decent. The bun was toasted too much, so it absorbed not much of the sauce - this meant that all the sauce oozed out of the sandwich very quickly! The sauce also lubricated the avocado as well, prompting some of the slices to ooze out!

I can see the vision in having a lot of soft/smooth textures (pork belly, avocado) mixed with vegetables, but it just didn't pan out as well as the description made it sound. 

We were the only people in on a weekend evening and it still took some time for it to be prepared. While the format is fast food, I am not sure if they could handle a mealtime rush.

The washrooms below have been nicely renovated, but the white floors visibly need mopping.

{"text":"This place looked promising but fell flat.   I ordered the fish burger.   When I got it, it looked unique in that the bun was blue.   After I started eating the burger, the bun started falling off.  I could barely eat the burger because the whole bun fell off into crumbs and I had to use a fork and knife to eat it.  the burger was average and wasn't anything unique.  I had better burger at another joint.  also, the music was too loud so it was hard to talk and hear.  I would not come back again."}
{"text":"*Located across from UoT near Baldwin. 
*Not only sandwiches, menu also include drinks (not pop & juices) - and sides like yam fries and asian slaw.
*prices are a bit higher. A meal (including drinks and sides) can cost around $20/person. 
*Grand opening is on May 27th. 

-Red wine braised beef sandwich - $13.99
The portion was quite substantial and the braised beef was tender and well seasoned. I liked how you are getting different textures from the fried onions and mushrooms as well. All in all, a pretty damn good sandwich!

-Tonkatsu Pork Sandwich - $9.99
In general I prefer my tonkatsu to have that crispy panko texture and unfortunately this did not deliver. I also found the pork to be a bit dry, perhaps more wasabi sauce would help! I found the both the fries + yam fries on the side were not greasy nor too salty, quite tasty!

-Teppanyaki Teriyaki Chicken Burger - $10.99
the chicken was juicy and perfectly seasoned with a slight kick of the wasabi mayo - delicious!

-Soy glazed pork belly sandwich - $11.99
The meat had a melted in your mouth texture and I found the lean-to-fat ratio was really good as well. The creaminess from the avocado actually worked well with the spicy and sour kimchi"}
{"text":"Such an amazing burger place in downtown Toronto. Clean, neat and well-organised. To begin, the prices are very friendly and the menu is pretty variable. I and my girlfriend came there for lunch. I took a curry pork burger combo, and she ordered a teriyaki chicken burger. I usually eat not less than 2-3 burgers for lunch, however, what we received, made us completely full. The pork burger was delicious and fresh. An important fact that the amount of meat in their burgers exceeds the amount of bread. NO FOOD CHEATING! GOOD, RESPECT! My girlfriend remarked that it was the best cooked chicken that she's ever tried, I agree! Good Luck, Teara Lab"}
{"text":"My foodie friend got two free meal vouchers for Teara Lab so we had to check it out. Teara Lab is a Japanese fusion restaurant that specializes in burgers and sandwiches, serving items such as Teppanyaki Teriyaki Chicken Burger and Yuzu Teriyaki Fish Burger. Located by UofT St. George, it's another campus option for students to go for lunch or after class. There's enough tables at this minimalist-designed restaurant for you to sit and enjoy your meal or you can order to go. 

All of their sandwiches sounded appetizing but I decided on the Kalbi Shortrib Sandwich for my visit. I personally enjoyed it and found the combo to be a filling meal. I do think the sandwich prices alone are a bit steep (the Red Wine Braised Beef sandwich costs $13.99). The sandwich prices should be around $7-8 at most. I do recommend trying out Teara Lab if you are an adventurous eater and love Asian fusion or Japanese."}
{"text":"Not fully impressed by the quality and merely mediocre by the taste standards. I am not sure if it's just because I made it right before their closing time, or it was the overhyped media reviews that I read contributing to higher expectations. Nevertheless, it fell below my expectations.
What was ordered....and it's truthful opinion.
Teriyaki fish burger with squid ink 
The burger was cold and slightly too dry, fish burger and it's toppings looked slapped.

Red wine braised beef sandwich 
Beef on its own tasted not too bad, but the ratio of toppings too much vs the braised beef was too little. It's almost as if you can only taste the bread, sauce and toppings, but the braised beef was gone in two bites.

Fries
Not to bad, a little too wrinkly and dry as well. 

Milk Tea
Matcha milk tea was a little too sweet for my liking, but the Okinawa was not too bad. 

All in, it's worth a one time try, but maybe overrated for what they charge along with the quality and portions of servings."}
{"text":"Interesting and pretty tasty. i now have to come back and try all the different ones (around 6 or 7 main on the menu). Staff nice. Place clean.

On the par side, which worries me a bit regarding the sustainability of this new place: 1-the wait is pretty long for sandwiches and despite 5 persons behind the counter preparing food, 2- the price (a sandwich combo for 11 to 16 CAD) is a bit high, but it is true that the portion size is pretty big (hopefully they wont reduce it and keep the same price... as one often sees with newly opened places - that would be the End of the place in a couple of weeks), 3- because of the size of the portions and the type of bread they use, it is damn hard to eat those sandwiches like sandwiches... you need a fork or to accept you will have sauce etc dripping all over down your fingers, hands and wrists, 4- sitting place at the back is bright and not privacy at all wherever you  seat"}
{"text":"came here for lunch around 1pm today and there was a big line-up, i took the staff's suggestion and tried teriyaki chicken burger, the chicken was perfectly cooked, big and juicy! the customer service was great even during rush hour. the staffs were very helpful and answered all my questions with patience.  i also got a voucher for a free sandwich! i will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I like the concept of Teara Lab but the execution and quality of the food fell short. Service was the regular standard: prompt and friendly.

The flavours are there but the dryness of the burger buns worked against the unique flavours as my mouth was just full of dry bread with each bite. The black bun didn't taste any different than a regular bun - more of a gimmick for Instagrammers. I was also super excited for the seaweed fries... But they tasted like standard fries without the seasoning. 

Since its in soft opening, there's a lot for room from improvement. I didn't try any of their drinks, perhaps if I'm around I'll try one - but I don't foresee myself returning to Teara Lab.

PS: Am I the only one who thought Teara Lab was a skincare line boutique from the name and the gorgeously beautiful marble and gold decor?"}
{"text":"Came here over a week ago and had the teriyaki chicken burger. It was quite tasty - the chicken was very tender and juicy. However I'm not sure if the burger is worth $10. I didn't find it to be that special because the burger just tasted like regular chicken teriyaki on a bun. But then again I'm not a huge burger fan and I'm sure many people will love this place. I also wanted to try the pork belly sandwich but they didn't have any at the time. However, I did receive a free sandwich voucher so I will be going back again to try the sandwich :p"}
