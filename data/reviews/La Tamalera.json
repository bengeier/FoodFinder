{"text":"My fiancé and I were headed to Mont Royal and were going to stop by Figaro for lunch. However, we changed our minds about lunch and found this amazing gem. We had molletes and tacos de flor de Jamaica. The molletes were great, but the tacos were out of this world deliciosos. We also had tamales de queso y jalapeños which did not fail to please. And the agua fresca de jamaica was the perfect balance of sweet and slightly tart. The decor was festive, and the waitress was extremely nice. Stop in if you are in town or if you are a local."}
{"text":"My wife and me were looking for a good, authentic, Mexican restaurant. Finally we found a great one. Is not easy even in Mexico to found really good \"tamales\" but these are one of the best. With surprise You can find also authentic \"huevos rancheros\", \"cafe lechero\" Veracruz style (it will be perfect for winter). The horchata drink is also good. Forget the \"gringo\" Mexican cliche; This is one of the good ones!"}
{"text":"Tasty Mexican food is always on the menu.

La Tamalera did not disappoint.

We had a chicken tamale, Tacos de cochinita, and Tacos al pastor.

The tamale was ok. A little heavy on the dough and light on the chicken. I don't have a lot of tamale experience though. Maybe it's meant to be that way? The spicy sauce served with the tamale was green with red pepper flecks throughout. Spicy and good!

The cochinita was swimming in an amazing braised broth as topped with pickled onions.   We were fighting over this one.

The al pastor tacos were a little dry but had a great flavor and were topped with cilantro and fresh cut pineapple. No canned pineapple here! 

At the end of the meal I inquired about desert and, lucky me, a decadent Tres leche cake was on the menu. It was beautifully plated, fresh, and not too sweet.

I am one happy customer!"}
{"text":"Cuteness overload! This place is such a nice little Mexican restaurant, fun for a family night outing or casual friend hangout. 

I'll confess, I was weary that such an adorable Mexican joint, might mean the food wouldn't be up to par (I'm used to the Saint Hubert street Mexican dives that offer super delicious and authentic food). Although I only had the chance to try the tamales, they were fantastic!! In fact all the food I saw seemed to be the real deal. The only catch is you'll definitely pay more than on Saint Hubert, but it seems worth it to me if you're looking for a slightly more upscale Mexican experience."}
{"text":"Amazing little restaurant ! It's quite easy to walk by it or miss it but if you walk in you'll see that this place is decorated quite beautifully and has a great amazing Latin vibe. I had never been able to find elotes until I ate here and they are amazing ! Had 4 different tacos here and each was amazing this fish and al pastor were my favourites. Great flavour and good size ! And if your looking for horchata hit this place up ! Amazing service good food what's not to love ?"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican tacos, fast friendly service at a reasonable price, great little place I'm sure to visit again.  Lost one star for no booze :)"}
{"text":"Excellent Tacos and Tamales! I especially recommend the baja shrimp tacos, they make me go back to this place almost weekly. Service is fast and staff is amicable, great recommendations by them on what to order. The price is fair and the atmosphere/decor is memorable and lovely. I highly recommend it, cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is simple, imaginative, and outstanding favors. I have something different every time I come here and walk away feeling like this is a nice little secret in my neighborhood. Small, quaint, family-run restaurant."}
{"text":"Pour un repas authentique mexicain pas cher, on ne se trompe pas. Les tamales sont au prix de 2 ou 3$. Les plats sont environ 12$ et je n'ai même pas pu finir mon assiette. On peut aussi prendre 1 litre de jus frais pour 4$! 

Le décor couleurs bonbon fait penser à une chambre de petite fille. On retrouve des cadres religieux aux murs sur lesquels on a dessiné des bulles de bandes dessinées. Bref c'est un méli-mélo d'un peu n'importe quoi. 

Pour moi c'est une belle option de semaine quand on n'a pas envie de cuisiner mais qu'on ne veut pas se ruiner!"}
{"text":"In Montreal there are really very few Mexican restaurants worth eating at. La Tamalera is the good one worth returning for service/food/price. Also, we can find best tamales in Montreal.

It's not really pricy, My Tortas Ahogadas ($9.50) is served with pork, black beans, garnished with pickled onions, radishes and avocados"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a small bite or long dinner date - it's both intimate and friendly, spare and bright. The food is very good - please, Tamalera, stick around. We need your tamales and pork tacos and horchata."}
{"text":"I just have to say that it's a great colorful place, good music, best bajas tacos and awesome service! I'll come back to taste the whole menu!! Thank you La Tamalera!!"}
{"text":"C'était pour l'anniversaire d'une toute petite fille. Nous étions une vingtaine et ils ont su mettre tout le monde à l'aise. Un endroit chaleureux, où la bouffe authentique mexicaine est reine! J'y ai pris les tacos végé à la fleur d'hibiscus et c'était bon, doux! L'intérieur est aussi authentique vous allez voir! Un charmant endroit où aller manger pour peu cher sur Fairmount."}
{"text":"Happy we finally got to try this place out I'm not usually in this location but it was great!

It's very authentic and extremely well priced. I had the gringa which was a large taco with cheese pineapple and chicken, served with onions and coriander on top. The two wedges of lime that came with it was all it needed it was wonderful !! There own hot sauce comes with each plate pretty much so don't you worry spice lovers.

Next up we shared the veal sandwich, we weren't exactly sure if it was going to be chicken or veal as it only said melianese on the board but it was okay. The meat wasn't very crispy but the guacamole and fried beans with lettuce and mayo inside made the flavours pop. We tried the corn on the cob stick with mayo and ketchup seasoning, it wasn't fresh the corn and we didn't really like the mayo combination. To be fair it was my first time having it so
I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like.Last but not least the crispy little tacos with pork guacamole pineapple and onions, it was really good.

Our waitress was very nice and came right up to us as soon as we got in. I was really impressed with all the little pictures and signs and decorations it made you feel like you were at home eating.

Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Mexican food lovers rejoice! La Tamalera is an awesome place to grab an authentic bite without breaking the bank. Fish Tacos were cooked to perfection and all the ingredients were fresh and full of flavor. Barbacoa came in a very generous portion and was absolutely delicious. Will happily go back to try the Tamales!"}
{"text":"Yeah!  Tasty Mexican!  Modern decor and an old b/w movie being projected on the wall while we were there. Neat.  The menu is small, but you should be able to find something you like.    There were some fruity looking drinks being served in Mason Jars as well.  I was too chicken to ask what they were!  We were happy to be able to get out Mexican fix even in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great little place. Friendly staff. Casual set up. I've been a few times and everything I've eaten is fresh and tasty. Love having places like this in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Very fresh tacos and the atmosphere is quite chill - I definitely recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a quick but great authentic Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Hunger managed!  
Baja Tacos rockin my taste bud tissues happy place. 
Salsa, perfecto!
Ambiance delightful.  Food is clean, fresh!
No cerveza but that dont get in the way. 
The lemonade was quenching.  
Will be back. Have been back. Will be back again.

Angelly and I each have a different treatment to pork tacos.  Both excellent!

Definitely an in-the-hood regular \"happy place\" provider."}
{"text":"People are always complaining about overpriced Mexican food. This place is not cheap, but the bang is totally worth your buck here. Portions are generous--I innocently ordered a watermelon juice which came in a glass jar so large, it could have lasted me (and a small family) all day. Then I kind of went overboard and ordered two different taco dishes which were both excellent and came out in record time, piping hot and fresh from the kitchen. Flavourful and plentiful in its ingredients. The waitress was a sweetheart too. It's kitschy inside, with all the Frida Kahlo and Dia de Los Muertos paraphernalia that Mexico's neighbours to the north have grown to obsess over in popular culture, but somehow--it all works. Good music, good vibes, good food, good service, all for a good price. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Awesome tamales, home made by a very friendly mexican family. A must try if you want to taste the real deal"}
{"text":"Quirky decor, matched with awesome food! It felt modern, with Mexican stereotype flairs. (That was meant as a compliment)

The guacamole was creamy, chunky, and full of flavor.

Our table shared a couple cheese and chili tamales. They were alright; they were heavy on the masa dough. Having eaten homemade temales from Mexico, the ones from La Tamalera were a far cry from those homemade ones.

As a main, I had shredded pork tacos, which came in a tasty pork broth, housed in a pot. The broth was a little on the greasy side, though it wasn't a deal breaker.

Overall, the place it tasty and the prices are pretty fair. Definitely worth eating at."}
{"text":"La Diabla on St-Laurent sold homemade tamales before they shut down (RIP). Although their moles and salsas survived the loss of their retail location and are still available around town, I knew of no replacement for their tamale fridge. La Tamalera is a worthy successor. Today they had three flavours (pork, chicken, cheese & jalapeño) and all were excellent. 2.50 each for takeout, 7 for a plate of two with a little bowl of beans and a tiny beer mug of seriously great cooked tomatillo salsa. 

$4 seemed like a lot for their horchata, until a full litre of it arrived in a mason jar. The pink tint matched the bright decor, and the taste suggested added rosewater or hibiscus. More than enough for two to share. 

We watched a parade of attractive food go by, destined for a large family seated at one of the five tables in this large, stylish but mostly empty space. The menu is scattered around a few (incomplete) chalkboards, and we needed some help to make sense of it (and discover the $7 tamales plate). 

There were great-looking brunch options as well. Will be back. Overall, the food is on par with Tachido but the physical environment may need work for this place to pull in customers. Don't leave without checking out the bathroom."}
{"text":"Such a cute taco shop! The decor is like hanging out at a picnic but it's all about the tacos. I had the carnitas which were amazing. A little sweet and tangy (mangos!) plus you add your own green hot sauce. 3 for $9.50 was a little on the pricier side but I wouldn't let that deter me from coming again. Finished it off with a warm churro"}
{"text":"Cute little shop (loved the decoration!) serving authentic Mexican food. I actually cannot testify that it is authentic, since I don't know Mexican cuisine that well, but they serve other things that tacos and burritos, so I guess there's that. 

We had tameleras (CAN$8) and tacos (CAN$10), and both were very good. We also tried their homemade lemonade (CAN$4 for a pitcher), perfect to go with it. The extra corn with cheese that we indulged in (CAN$5) was however not super good. 

Overall, I liked the food, I liked the place and the service was very friendly, but it was a bit empty, there was no music in the background, and we felt like the kitchen could close whenever (we arrived early though, because we saw that the restaurant wasn't open late). Maybe it is more of a lunch spot?"}
{"text":"I've had tacos al pastor and chilaquiles and they were both very good. The restaurant is nicely decorated and it shows it's a Mexican family business, very warm and attentive."}
{"text":"Go here!!

So freaking good.  We had four different tacos, 
chips/guac, agua fresca, and churros.  And it was all so fantastic.  Food came out fast, service was fantastic, quality was high, and price was right."}
{"text":"I'm sure this food is better not order as take out but it's hard to judge that so please keep this in mind when reviewing.  We ordered from Ubereats and the driver got lost so we were pretty famished.

Mole tamales wete the thing I was looking forward to most having had some in Mexico and having fond memories.  Flavour was great but tamale was a little dry in texture.  The tacos were yum and the salad was okay..a little high prices I thought.   The spicy sauce was HOT but flavorful.  The horchata tasted goid but I've never had pink horchata so was a little confused by that.   Watermelon juice really refreshing.   Really great flavours all around..we need to try them innperson to give them a fair taste test."}
{"text":"Was nearby for an appointment and dropped in for lunch.  Food is excellent and very authentic.  Seems a little expensive at first but quickly realized it was worth every sent.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the corn vegetarian tacos with habanero sauce and fresh cheese...also liked the fresh homemade Sandia"}
{"text":"Went with my friends last week, loved de decor of the place. The horchata was very good, refreshing, and the food was good too, delicious seasoning and very good service."}
{"text":"Ô DIOS MIO!!!!!!!!!

So, about a month ago I was thinking to myself: \"Man, those tortas at Tachido are amazing, it'd be great to have a tamale somewhere in Montréal as well!  Maybe I should learn how to make them myself?  I wish that I had a grandmother from Mexico to show me how...\" and suddenly, whilst heading back from buying something or other at the Delphi, I noticed a cute little pink sign poking out of the place that used to be that librairie/café/n'importquoi that did incredibly well while Arts was shut for renovatios.  I decided to investigate.

First impression: the windows were filled with catholicious candles and further in there were some repurposed wine boxes and cute little knick-knacks from el pais viejo adorabling (=adorning+aborable) the walls.  My interest was MUY piqued.

After strolling up to the bar, I checked to see if there were any TAMALES available and unfortunately they weren't going to be ready for an hour...no probs, I assume that they were devoured by the teeming masses.  I returned after a few hours and asked the delightful chef/owner about what the tamale offerings were: spicy chili and cheese, chicken and salsa verde, and by the time I had dug into those I had completely lost my mind and forgotten what the third one was.  It was delicious, I can say that for certain.  Most insane thing: 6 tamales = 15$, canadian.  For perspective on this for those who are uninitiated to tamales, I used to pay $3 in 2006 in California and think that that was cheap.  I'll be surprised if they don't bump up a little in price, but in any case they are certainly worth an extra buck or so.  In addition to the tamales, I did notice that they offer some other delicious treats (pozole, tortas, etc) for what looks like a fair price.

I returned today as I am a glutton and was feeling peckish on the way home from the Y, so I picked up 4 more and as well as a concha and I was again shocked at how good her food is.  It was sort of slow we had a little minute to chat and it turns out that she's got a great deal of experience in her madre's restaurant in Mexico and she went to culinary school in Mexico as well!  I used to snarf down conchas in Watsonville any time I passed a Panaderia and this one was the absolute freshest and lightest one that I've had to date.

I haven't tried it yet, but, horchata too?!?!  I am hooked.

Viva la tamalera!"}
