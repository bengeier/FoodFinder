{"text":"I came here for the taco night on Tuesdays ($1.25 hard shell, $2.00 soft tortilla) and they are really good!  I had a family member get wings and they were delicious as well!  My biggest complaint is the fact you are able to smoke inside.  Smoke typically doesn't bother me in places that allow it, but I am not sure if this place has ventilation for it at all, and it was probably too cold for most people to have a window or door open to air it out.  It actually made me feel sick today.  So to anyone who actually is sensitive to smoke, stay clear!   I will probably come back when the weather is warm for the outdoor bbq pit, or at least to see if they keep a window open, but until then I am leaving this review as is."}
{"text":"This place is everything a dive bar should be however they have amazing hot wings and when I say hot, I mean hot! They are made from locally grown Carolina Reaper peppers (if you get the hottest ones) and are really hot but amazingly tasty. They range from 1 (which is not mild) to 12. We started off with a 1 and I was presently surprised that there was actually some spice to it. Next we had 9s and I though wow these are hot and I like them a lot! And then I had to have the 12s. After the first bite I thought, man, those 9s were not even hot!! And I immediately liked the 12s. While they were great, I did have to wait a few minutes in between each wing because my lips were on fire. I highly recommend getting these wings.  As for the rest, this is a typical dive bar. The bar tender was great as was the woman who cooked the food. The only bad thing, smoking is allowed inside here! I smelled terrible after I left."}
