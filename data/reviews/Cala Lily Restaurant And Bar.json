{"text":"Best restaurant in the North Hills, and top 5 in Pittsburgh.  Service is phenomenal.  Definitely worth it. Very romantic or sit at the bar a have a good time for the evening while still enjoying great food.  I always get the specials (normally 3 -4 fishes and a meat option or 2), but the standard menu is delicious as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful food creations. Worth every penny. Very knowledgeable staff. They know the menu and are great at recommendations. Don't be afraid to go outside of your comfort zone."}
{"text":"Done! Never returning! We also used to go (like other reviewers) when it was the \"old\" cala- we have had bad luck ever since they moved and reopened to the \"new\" cala. We do not like sitting elbow to elbow in the over crowded dining area. Think Picnic table! Its one of my favorite places just because very few places  have escargot in the burgh.....uh..husband doesn't like it- nope ...not so much (more on that below!) However he offered to take me for my birthday. He REQUESTED and RESERVED a booth without elbow to elbow neighbors! ( fyi- the bar area has 2 sort of secluded booths that's what we were promised) after waiting 25 min. They tried to seat us on the other side- elbow to elbow squished  next to other people- we said thanks...but no thanks we want the booth away from other people like we REQUESTED. That's when the.. I guess 20 something yr old manager came over and said take it or leave it. We said we RESERVED a private booth. He said we are busy and those booths seat 4 people and there is only 2 of you- we would loose $ if we gave you that! ( I own a business btw) I said fine- then- that should have been said when the reservation was made ...then WE would have decided to take it or leave it. HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY!!  However you can't say that once we are here?!? ...eventually we got a four person table/booth not what we asked for- with people next to us on both sides! Everyone seated \"after\"us got there food \"before\" us hmmm.. so we went outside to smoke ..4 min. Later our table was cleared off including our half glasses of wine!! Not exaggerating  4 min!! We were told oops! And if we \"bought\" more wine we would get some extra in the glass!! What??? How about 2 free glasses ?? You took our freaking $8.50 a glass wine and dumped it!! Nope! Had to buy a glass!! True FOLKS!! Husband ordered medium rare filet - it was raw! Same thing happened last time...THEN raw fish time before that!!! ( why he doesn't like going) I always get pumpkin tortilini - old and Brown! Not up to par either!! Not worth hassle, headache and raw food! Shame ...this time was the last time $120.00 down the drain! Rude!! Bad food! Makes me sad!! Tip!! Make reservation for a party of four for private booth...then say you are waiting for 2 people that mysteriously never show! You may get that private table!! Otherwise you will we squished literally elbow to elbow with strangers! God forbid you have to use bathroom! It's a pia!! Squeezing in between people and tables! And I'm 125 lbs!!"}
{"text":"Zero shot there is better food anywhere in the North Hills than Cala Lily!

The only bad part about eating at Cala Lily is having to decide what NOT to eat. I eat out three nights a week in Manhattan and I never, ever see menus that are this enticing top to bottom. I ate there last night and I am still suffering some serious mental anguish for missing out on some of the dishes. If someone told me I would pass up on things like Maine lobster and crab soup, pumpkin tortellini with crab meat, burgundy-glazed escargots, beef and pork shoulder burger, steak Diane in a sherry reduction, etc...I would've just walked away and said \"obviously we don't know each other\".

What I did eat however, was tremendous. The Crabmeat Hoelzel is the best in the city (back off Duquesne Club). You think an iceberg wedge with Roquefort, bacon and cracked pepper sounds \"run of the mill\"? Think again. Branzini in a lemon & Sauternes sauce? Yeah try to find that in Lawrencevile. And the pork chop...oh the pork chop. Two inches thick With a Cajun rub, a fiery tomato sauce and stuffed banana peppers with hot sausage. Just stop. A nice Tempranillo/Merlot blend to wash it down with in a great environment with super-friendly staff? Get out of town.

Unfortunately, as I type I am currently out of town. Back in NYC where these wanna-be chefs all dream about pulling off what Cala Lily pulls off every night right off of Route 8. Eat anywhere but Cala Lily? Fughedaboudit!!!"}
{"text":"+Dinner for four--nearly $400.00; food--passable-- but I wouldn't write home about it. If you call two weeks in advance for reservations, asking for a particular table for a special occasion-- you will be told \"No problem\". When you get to the restaurant-- BIG PROBLEM: \"Oh, sorry-- the table you requested is taken-- but we have one available over THERE [where all the bar patrons are milling around in their Penguins and Pirates shirts discussing the latest loss to the Cubs]. When we point out that we had++ requested a specific table two weeks earlier, and explain that we were told \"no problem\"-- we were met with: \"---I DO have a table for you, just not the one you requested...\" In other words-- \"take it or leave it\". 

Cala Lily does NOT understand exactly what a \"reservation\" is suppose to do. It's suppose to HOLD that which was reserved [all of you Seinfeld fans will remember the reservation for the rental car when Jerry is told \"...we have the reservation--- but we don't have a car for you...\" As Jerry says: \"The reservation is suppose to HOLD the car\". Cala Lily's management needs to watch Seinfeld more often--- then MAYBE I'd have the table we asked for two weeks in advance. But it doesn't really matter-- I won't be eating at Cala Lily in the future-- did I mention that my wife was ill all night after our meal?"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST. The drinks from Laura, Lisa and Unis are as good as the food. Place not cheap but you get what you pay for. They also have a great happy hour. Call ahead of time for a reservation as it gets pretty busy on weekends."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what they preserve their food with but hope you don't live too far from home. So uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Food was fair drinks good.  Friendly service. Good bread. Very good choices 
Burger is awful"}
{"text":"WOW, what else is there to say. Best restaurant and service in the Pittsburgh area. There offering of specials are more than most restaurants have on there menu. Have been to the Cala Lily at least six times, each visit gets better."}
{"text":"If you're wary of restaurants in strip malls, Cala Lily will completely change that! And I mean COMPLETELY.

Who would've thought you could find top notch, high quality dishes in a strip mall, but that's exactly what Cala Lily is serving up. Cala Lily has quite the listing of premium proteins like filet mignon, veal chops, Chilean sea bass, halibut. Everything on the menu looked absolutely fantastic, but the specials are where it's at. Also, ask about their secret menu! Another plus is that they're very flexible. If you want to change up how you want your proteins prepared, they are happy to do it.  

Everything my table ordered was prepared to perfection and I would highly recommend everything we ordered. My favorites, though, were the veal chop and filet mignon. If you order filet mignon, I recommend requesting them to make it with the espresso rub, served with tart cherry Cabernet sauce. This is top three of my favorite filets of all time! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!

I will be coming here again and again and I cannot wait to try more items from their menu!"}
{"text":"We used to go here when it was at the old location and not many people knew about it.  Food was always 5 star.  This has gone down hill as far as I am concerned since they moved to the new location.  Here is what I think has happened.  They are in a much higher traffic area now and are just trying to \"churn out\" customers.  Felt very rushed.  Food came out very quickly. Was \"OK\". Sea Bass was good but sauce was too overpowering.  Chicken Romano was very good.  Side dishes...meh...clearly been hanging around a lot.  Good service except for the rushed part.  Atmosphere is OK - a little crowded so if you are planning a first date, or anniversary dinner - I would skip it.  Overall I think they have replaced quality for quantity."}
{"text":"Quaint and intimate atmosphere, accompanied by flavorful dishes and friendly service. The pumpkin and crab tortellini are a strong entree. The seafood specials like Chilean sea bass are also noteworthy. Any of the salad options will satisfy."}
{"text":"Despite living in the area for 17 years I never went here. The facade of the old site was unappealing. 
My loss if it was anything like I enjoyed on my first visit recently. 
Three couples enjoyed the food and drink and staff. Outstanding. We will be back"}
{"text":"It's been several years since we visited Cala Lily and that was at its old location. Now we have visited twice in the last two weeks.  We stopped last week and had a really great meal that my wife and I split . It consisted of a really thick cut of Chilean sea bass and sides. It was excellent. Our waitress Abby steered us to this entree.  The following week we stopped again and it happened to be happy hour.  Again we both had a delicious meal and our waitress Heidi was great.  Both nights the entire wait staff was very attentive.  We had no complaints and now Cala Lily will be one of our regular stops."}
{"text":"We had the CAJUN GULF SHRIMP & FILET MIGNON TIPS and THE STRIP STEAK and two martinis.  The service, food and drinks were excellent.  Price was fair.  Tables are a little close for intimate conversation."}
{"text":"Simply Excellent! 
Five Stars!
Pricey but if you go early they have specials. 
Diverse menu, friendly people and a great owner!"}
{"text":"After one bite I had my wife pinch me. Was I  awake? Was I alive? Was I in an alternate universe. Where in the world could food taste this incredible? How could it be possible. Well, it was possible tonight at Cala Lilli. Every bite was a dream come true. 

To start things off our server Linda was a doll. So helpful and accommodating our every need. Couldn't have asked for better service. 

Now on the food. Wow. Where do I begin? We started with an amazing hummus and crab portobello appetizer that was out of this world. Then we moved on to a crab bisque that was to die for. Oh how could I have forgotten...even the bread was perfection. Now to the main event....

The lobster seafood ravioli was the entree choice. I have yet to have a meal as AMAZING. Traveled to Italy. Traveled to Greece. Traveled all around the world and no one can offer a better meal than Llllis in Gibsonia. Yes, look no further than Gibsonia, PA. I'm serious people. 

If you haven't been there yet, you haven't lived. You must go. If you have been you KNOW the truth I'm speaking!!!

Thank you Cala Lilli for this memorable evening."}
{"text":"Best food in the north suburbs and half the city. Foodies only need to apply simple beer selection but pairs well with the hand crafted fare. Chef is a genius. Great meal every time I waited 6 times before I left a review to assure my integrity. If you don't eat here you are missing out."}
{"text":"Came tonight for the first time.  The atmosphere was great, the service was perfect, and everyone's food looked amazing.  I got the lobster and crab bisque. It had a great flavor, though a bit too think and over-salted. I also got an appetizer special which was a portobello with crab stuffing, spinach, and fontinella cheese. It was fantastic.  I would love to come back and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"What a great little find in the shopping plaza by target.  Very friendly staff with great variety of drinks.    I love their wedge salads.  I had the pork shop special which was juicy and done to perfection.   I will definitely return.   Great little to hang out.   This is a must visit in the north hills area.  Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere & staff. Found out Chef Rivero used to work at Rico's for 20 years, now he runs his own restaurant & Rico's is the worse for it. Does not seat a lot - reservations for Friday or Saturday are a must."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection, Stella Artois on tap as well as Victory.   Servers attentive and nice, where I take the stars away is the ridiculously annoying and loudmouth patrons and blasting TV.    You would think this place would not be a sports bar, but it is .  

So, if you're looking for a nice place to grab a quiet drink and eat, this is not it. I miss the days of places not having tv's.  

I might be back, probably not though.  There are plenty of other places that serve good beer with TV's and Cala Lily fell into that trap unfortunately because the food is stellar."}
{"text":"I'm legitimately shocked that there are negative reviews on here for this restaurant.  I've been a huge fan of Cala Lily since the beginning. Their new location is lovely - the interior is as classy as it gets - and the food is, unsurprisingly, fantastic.  Rick, the chef, pours his heart into his creations, and his passion manifests in every bite.  We're lucky to have him in Pittsburgh - Cala Lily is easily one of the best restaurants in the entire city.

I find the reviews regarding preservatives utterly preposterous.  I have been here tens of times, and ingredients are ALWAYS fresh.  You honestly can't go wrong here.  Everything is delicious, however, my personal favorite is the Pumpkin Tortellini with jumbo crab, julienne leeks, and roasted tomatoes.  The Steak Diane is also an amazing choice - the meat just melts in your mouth.  To start, I recommend the Portabello & Crab Florentine.  

Don't forget to save room for dessert!  Do yourself a favor and try the Cala Lily Rose (chocolate covered ice cream, served with fresh raspberries in Chambord).  I guarantee you'll thank me afterwards."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere , the food was incredible!!! Every part of this dinner was great from the time we walked in!"}
{"text":"Amazing! You can't beat the friendly atmosphere, employees and the chef.... just unbelievable food! Support your local family business! Highly recommend and make sure you make a reservation. Great HH Specials"}
{"text":"The best seafood I've had in a long time. Perfectly cooked and the wait staff were awesome."}
{"text":"The space was very quaint with a large bar and friendly staff! We sat at the bar to eat since it was pretty packed, but that's got to be a good sign, right?! The bartenders were very helpful and accommodating. When my bf asked for a little extra on his filet, they cut him a fresh piece!  We started with a crab stuffed portobello. It was quite tasty and full of delicious garlic and butter. We then received our entrees. I received a scrumptious lobster stuffed ravioli with shrimp, crab, and colossal scallops in a sherry butter cream sauce...yummo! My boyfriend ordered a melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon with a Cabernet wine sauce. We had fresh grilled vegetables and whipped buttery mashed potatoes and sides. I would say that this place was definitely a good date night or special occasion type of joint. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Complete dissatisfaction and disappointment. My parents were trying to celebrate their 59th wedding anniversary by having a nice dinner in the restaurant on the 25th of April. My mother who is 78 years old and handicapped called ahead for the reservation and 
spoke to Abby. She explained to Abby that she was handicapped and had a hard time moving around and getting into and out of small spaces. She then requested a booth from Abby because of her handicap and was assured by Abby that the booth was no problem and would be available for their 1745 reservation on the above date. When my parents arrived for their dinner reservation, the hostess attempted to sit them at a two top in a tightly confined space to which my parents said it was too tight and my mother could not move to get into and out of the area. They asked for the booth that was requested at the time of the reservation and of course there were no booths available. All other alternatives for sitting my parents were not compatible for, or were not accessible for persons with handicaps and as such they had to leave and not enjoy an anniversary dinner at your restaurant. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone now or in the future. My parents attempted to phone the restaurant and speak to the manager to be told to leave a name and a number and he will get back to you.....well my parents phone did not ring and the answer machine does not contain a message from the manager at Cala Lily. I am personally offended and pissed off at how my parents were treated on their anniversary and by the inability of the restaurants management to field a call of complaint from my parents and attempt to make the situation right. Feel free to call me, Brian, at (757) 812-5327 and we can discuss the issue I have."}
{"text":"This is the best seafood and steak in town. The more you come the more you feel like family. I lo e that you can customize an order. My roommate is vegan, they always make something special when she joins me. I have another friend who is gluten free, they make it possible for him to eat too. I love their homemade cheesecakes! I love their pasta dishes. I personally like things spicy, so I always ask for them to turn up the heat. Their chili relano is the best in tawn."}
{"text":"Rick is a genius in the kitchen. Absolutely AMAZING food. If you want to splurge...this is the place to do it."}
{"text":"We are always on the lookout for great, hidden gems. Cala Lily is that gem! 

Great drink, and beer selection to start. The atmosphere is warm, and inviting, and the staff is wonderful too.

I ordered the Wedge salad with a warm bacon, & blue cheese dressing. It was to die for! My main meal was a NY Strip with a coffee crusted rub, and a dark cherry reduction. I can't describe just how delicious this was. The steak was perfectly prepared, and melted in your mouth! 

I had no room for dessert on this trip, but we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"What a let down. Very cramped. Only go if there are two of you. Food was decent, but way overpriced. Service was average. My sisters steak didn't come out with the rest of the dinners. When it did, it was absolutely raw. She asked for medium. Then they took the steak back and cooked it more, when it came back, half of it was missing. They had the audacity to still charge us for it. When we asked politely for it to be taken off the bill, they did, but took the steak! After having to ask again, they brought the steak back out to go. Drinks were weak, too. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Being from California,  have extremely high standards as it relates to any Mexican food, and Chile Rellenos are my absolute favorite. 
Cala Lily's Drunken Goat Cheese & Portabello Mushroom Chile Relleno is by far the best Chile Relleno I've ever had. And this isn't even a Mexican Restaurant!  
We also had the Sea Bass (absolutely wonderful), the crab cake (good, not great), espresso mousse cake (very rich chocolate), and a delicious Italian rum cake. 

We'll be back... even if it's just for the Chile Relleno!"}
{"text":"Food was top notch.  My wife's salmon was done perfectly, and my filet as well.  Very, very good.  One of the best filet I have had--a huge cut, cooked medium (they don't give you the size on the menu, but it was easily over 8oz).  The service was great as well.  I give it 4 stars though, because while I don't mind paying top dollar for good food and service, I expected Cala Lily to be just a little more upscale--at least business casual.  Instead, shorts, hoodies, ball caps; there is no dress code.  So depending on your expectations (for me, upscale, quiet, romantic dinner), you might be a little disappointed.  That said, I will be back--the food was that good."}
