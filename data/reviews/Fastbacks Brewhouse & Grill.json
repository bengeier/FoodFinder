{"text":"Heard some things from a buddy and elected to stop in for lunch. Not good! The diet cola I ordered tasted as if they had an issue with their waterline (very well watered aftertaste) and when I asked for a new one, the waitress agreed and then the second and even a 3rd and still nothing alright. So we just worked with it and just took small sips to get the food down.... However now we come to the food. Whoever cooked it, you can tell they tried. That's why I'm giving a second star compared to one, they tried.   At this point however, I would recommend stripping the building of plumbing, and reopening with maybe an updated menu and people who know how to properly prepare that menu."}
{"text":"Inedible. Avoid. Owner wouldn't stop yelling in the back when I was there. Highly unprofessional."}
{"text":"As you can see by the other reviews, this this place is terrible and I can tell another story. After the cavs parade yesterday, we stopped in since it was by the train station. We go in and order food and the service was beyond terrible. The staff was incredibly rude and they were more concerned about having cars that were parked in their parking lot instead of checking on their patrons or delivering warm food. Once the food was delivered, in between the staff just standing outside screaming in enjoyment of having their parking lot emptied, because no one else goes there and for good reason. Oh yes, once the food was delivered it was cold and terrible. Never filled up my water, never checked on us because they are outside enjoying their empty parking lot!!!!!!!!! This plac sucks and no northeast Ohioan should ever eat here. I'm sure they will be closed soon but don't make the same mistake we made"}
{"text":"They left a shoe in my salad and didn't know about Battlestar Galactica. Will not come to this establishment again."}
{"text":"It's the worst bbq on the planet. They'd be better off buying McRibs and reselling. It's almost like they have a deep seeded hate for the food and are trying to punish it for something."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? They may have a smoker, but they have no clue how to smoke meat. Dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"When people not from Cleveland talk shit about Cleveland this place is one of the reasons. This place is just as good as the Browns! Save your money."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst restaurants in Cleveland. Terrible, tasteless food, and an exceptionally rude staff.   The food here is about as edible as the food on a plane, but at least if I'm eating on a plane, I'm going somewhere.   Plus, from the looks of the place, the kitchen is probably filthy. Don't be surprised if you get food poisoning here.   Avoid this place at all costs."}
