{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas from this location at 6:00 PM. They told me it would be delivered within the hour. I called back at 7:15 and he told me the delivery man was on his way to my place which is 10 minutes away from their location. The person never showed up. I called at 8:00 to cancel and they were unapologetic about the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza very unpleasant staff would not recommend it to anyone there are lots of other pizza places in the area to choose from so don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"They have good poutine."}
{"text":"the dumbest thing just happened. 

I usually order a small pizza and a small fry for around 12$ with no problem but today when i called he told me that he couldn't do it because it was under their delivery minimum.(10$)

My order was 9.98$ before tax.
the pizza is great but that was pathetic."}
{"text":"We ordered a three topping pizza with chicken wings and 3 cans of pop. The pizza was ok but nothing to rave about. The chicken wings were not chicken wings. They were similar to chicken from kfc which was really disappointing. So that was kind of misleading, which turns me off from a restaurant. I would not order from there again."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, but inconsistent product. I've done pick up and it was OK, but then a few weeks later I ordered the same and the sauce tasted different. Then one time I ordered for delivery and the guy must have dropped it a few times because it looked like a mess. I called them and the guy just said \"sorry man\" and hung up."}
