{"text":"I thought this place was called Aioli, and was thinking it was a pretty funny name for a restaurant unless you have a thing for garlic mayonnaise.  I'm not a linguist, but a google search tells me that alioli means the same thing, the spanish version of italian aioli.  Not sure what they intended with the name, but the garlic was very prominent in my meal.  Service was very homey. Our waiter was like my baba, dishing more food from our antipasto plate onto everyone's plates. You couldn't say no, and your plate and wine glass kept being filled so you lost count of just how much you had.  Our group was very large (I think there were 17 in our party), and they managed to get our dishes out together and mostly without mishap.  An order of veal was overdone, and was quickly replaced with a very rare replacement.   The antipasto misto, frutti di mare & prosciutto alla grillia  plate had a wonderful variety of vegetables, mozzarella, calamari, shrimp and several prosciutto rolled around cheese and arugula.  It was a great way to start the meal.  My tortellini alla fungi was delicious, but the garlic was overpowering, which for this garlic lover is rare.  The portions are huge!  My dinner companions were helpful on sampling the tortellini I couldn't finish, but there were still a few left after my plate made the rounds of our table.  They have a good variety of desserts, coffees and liqueurs to finish the meal.  My limoncello was crisp and cold, I tried it to see if it met the glowing descriptions I've heard for this lemon infused liqueur.  It was good, but I may need to travel to Italy to understand why some think this is like sunshine in a bottle.  The cheese plate included fig jam, three variations on pecorino/parmigiano reggiano, walnuts, grapes and cracker style bread sticks.  A bit light on the cracker options and I prefer more variety on the cheese front. I have yet to be wowed by truffle being infused in anything and in this case, the truffle did not stand out against the strong cheese.  A great spot for a group or romantic evening, excellent food and service."}
{"text":"We went here just because we felt like Italian- and we got reservations at the last minute.-which was a plus. And the place was crowded- definite plus for the last minute reservations then. The staff is very friendly and very knowledgeable - especially about the wines. They have an extensive wine list - which was awesome because the friends I went there with are wine connoisseurs. We started off with cocktails which hit the spot perfectly. The Calamari alla Griglia and Prosciutto alla Griglia was great and served with a mixed greens with a really tangy balsamic dressing. That set the tone for the rest of the meal. Agnello (rack of lamb), veal scaloppini and the day's- special -ravioli. The food was excellent - portions were just right. the wine was excellent and the service was great. It was a bit pricey no doubt. But totally worth it."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  I came here with a group of friends.  When ordering, I asked the server what he recommended from the pasta dishes,  and he replied with the spaghetti pescatore. However,  I was not in the mood for seafood,  and I asked what else he recommended. He then looked up from his notepad and said \"oh you don't want the spaghetti pescatore?\" and I said no.  I asked him again what else he recommended,  but he completely ignored me, and proceeded to ask my friend what she would like instead.  All my friends at the table saw this and were stunned. My friend decided to ask him for me again,  but he didn't answer and somehow he got her to choose her order. He then proceeded to move around the table, to come back to me last.  I understand that he wanted to take everyone else's order first while I figured mine out, but he approached it in a rude way, and decided to not acknowledge me and respect me as a customer. I was quite embarrassed to be treated that way, especially in front of others. When he finally came back to me,  I settled on the penne Alioli (without his help). My dish was too salty, and I did not enjoy it. When it was time to fill everyone's water, he filled all the glasses except for mine.  Although my glass was around 65% full, I couldn't help feel as if it was intentional. In addition,  I had no choice but to tip him 20% of the bill because our group was larger than 6, resulting in an automatic 18%, and splitting of our bills which resulted in 20%. I am never coming back again, as I do not appreciate being disrespected for no reason while I eat overly salty food for inflated prices."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  The Yelp picture (at time of this posting) couldn't have been more misleading. Expecting a dark, formal pressed-napkin setting, we were welcomed into Alioli with a bright, pleasant, Tuscan-inspired ambiance complete with terracotta accents and a relaxed buzz about it.  The all-male, all-Italian wait staff was courteous, clean, quick, dutiful...yet seemed to pride themselves on non-stop resto-witticisms, frequent compliments to the ladies, and endless 'suggestions' to add to our apparent light lunch orders. Yep, the Italian way!...  Most important, the food was equally surprising. Between three of us we enjoyed an arugula & salmon salad, red-peper gazpacho (soup special), sausage linguine (lunch special) and the mushroom ravioli in rose' sauce. Very little of the generous portions remained, and none disappointed.  Alioli caters to its location - smack in the gut of Mississauga - making it a perfect lunch staple for local businesses. Here you should host a casual business meeting, or, like us, enjoy a relaxing, filling break from your busy day."}
{"text":"Great friendly place with fantastic food! will be going back!"}
{"text":"In town for one night on business, and found this place through Yelp.  I picked it since it seemed to meet my requirements of being classy but not stuffy and had some good looking vegetarian dishes.  I was right!  Our waiter was great, and worked with us to order a delicious 1/2 bottle of wine.  It was great, and impressed my boss (who is not easily impressed, especially when it comes to wine).  She had the veal and seemed to like it.  I had a mushroom ravioli and it was great.  The bread for the table was focaccia, which is always such a decadent treat (I'm a carboholic!)  We were stuffed so no need for dessert, but I left totally satisfied.    My only beef was finding the parking entrance was a pain (had to pass the restaurant and pull a u-turn) and all the traffic from the construction (I was told Toronto is being built from the ground up) means it took us ages to get in.  But they were nice about it when we walked in."}
{"text":"Best Italian food i've ever had. The service is amazing and the staff is very friendly. I definitely recommend the penne ala vodka and the tiramisu for dessert, the quality is excellent !"}
{"text":"What an experience!! I visited this restaurant last week for the first time. The food was great - the waiters very polite and service quick. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The servers are arrogant & the food came out way too slow for the price. Our request for an appetizer was entirely forgotten! The food quality is not worth the price & the ambiance is cold & uninviting."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, fantastic food and great ambiance. The grilled calamari was delicious and so were the pasta dishes we tried.  Great find!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received, the waiter is one of those who thinks he's better than everyone else, despite the fact that he's still just a waiter.  I was seated and had to wait 15 minutes before we could see a menu or order a drink, waited another hour to come and collect our dishes, no one asked to refill our drinks, or see how our food was.   I will never come back."}
{"text":"Loved sitting outside. The service was great. The food is good too. A good restaurant in Mississauga for a special night out!"}
{"text":"Great Italian  food. Good service and out door porch. Good wine selection but be prepared to pay the price."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. It was ok. The service could have been better. The food was mediocre. 2 of the 4 glasses we got brought (1 wine 1 coke) were dirty. They seemed to be rushing us out the door. If your looking for a good Italian restaurant in Mississauga I would suggest not here but going to Michaels Back Door (it never disappoints)."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and half Italian, so I am picky when it comes to Italian food. Made a reservation at Alioli through OpenTable which already is a plus in my book. The servers were nice and made you feel like family immediately....I love that!  My wife ordered the Osobuco and I had the linguine with seafood. The Osobuco was not the  best I've ever had, but it was very good. It kept well too because I ate the leftovers the next day and the flavor was even better. The linguine in my mind was the standout dish. This is not something I normally order because of the heavy cream sauce, but I'm on vacation so I figured what the hell? It was delicious! Not too heavy, perfect flavor, and a good amount of seafood.  We finished off with some coffee drinks and creme brulee.   The only negative is they do not offer Moscato by the glass. This was disappointing to my wife. I will be back next time we are in Mississauga."}
{"text":"On Yelp, attire says dressy, however I called and the owners said it is casual.  We came a little bit more dressed up for a triple birthday dinner anyway.  So this restaurant is flexible.  They do not enforce a dress code, but generally people go looking classy.  Food Quality & Price: The general consensus was that the food was very good  However, all the dishes were \"saucy\" so if you're the type that doesn't like a lot of sauce on your food, ask for it on the side.  I had a lobster pasta which was delicious but as many others have mentioned the portions were big.  Not HUGE, but I did NOT have a appetizer and I only finished about 2/3s of my pasta. My husband ordered bison which he said was only okay.  Price was okay, typical of a restaurant similar to the Keg (think Summerlicious types). Appetizers range from $10 - $15.  Entrees varied from $18 - $30. Great wine/drink selection, the Prosecco with Orange Juice was divine.  The chocolate martinis were also a hit. It was a triple birthday so all the birthday people got a tiramisu cake... which to be honest, was the best I've ever had.  It was melt in your mouth SOFT! The only thing that maybe an issue is that if you go in a large group and ask for separate bills, they will do an automatic 20% gratuity charge. IMO, I think that defeats the purpose of tipping altogether, however, I understand it is a little more work.  I still do not think it is justified, but food for thought.   Facility: Located in Mississauga on Confederation and Burnhamthorpe.  It is an awkward location on the corner (because of the medians/dividers.  You kind of have to turn into the plaza or do a U-turn.  Not hard to find though.  Establishment is VERY nice, very romantic and elegant. However, on a Saturday night, they have live music but they were also packed.  So it was incredibly noisy and loud.  I had a difficult time holding a conversation with someone just across from me! As a large group, I would have liked to have a better view of the live music because we were kind of \"around the corner\", however, you can still hear it throughout the restaurant.  Service: Waitstaff was charismatic, attentive and charming. I echo the others with praises of \"great service!\"  Overall: A great experience with good food.  Definitely try once.  Not sure if I would seek out to eat there again though, but maybe if another party/group is going, I will certainly go along. The restaurant will also call you a few times to confirm table size closer to your reservation date. With my grading I give it a 4.5/5, I can't do halves so I will be generous and bump it up to a full five stars on Yelp."}
{"text":"I am definetly fan of this place. I have come here for many special occasions communions, confirmations. We have hosted my 2nd daughters confirmation here and our family continuously raves about the food.   Their calamari is to die for!!!  This is one of Missisauga's best Italian Restaurants."}
{"text":"Worst fine dining restaurant I have been to in a longtime. Everything was bad. Food, atmosphere, tables, lighting, washrooms. Very embarrassed   that this was my suggestions from fabricated reviews I read.    I would have rather had food court pasta than what they call pasta. I could have just purchased sauce and fresh pasta at LONGIS and for the pizza.  Well it was tasteless.    Nobody in our party were impressed.   This restaurant is horrible. Do not waste your money. So so disappointed."}
{"text":"They have an awesome ambience and even better range of wine that they serve. The servers are soo polite and well-behaved.  We went here for dinner and it felt like a really happy place to be. Surprisingly, they had a nice musician playing some nice tunes.  Food wise, this place is a little pricey and the food is just about good."}
{"text":"A cozy Italian place.  Just a bit loud to feel like family.  Prosciutto was wrapped with cheese and grilled.  Calamari was also grilled, not deep fried.  This really reminded me the trip to Rome several years ago.  I got Mushroom Risotto and it came with the expected wonder aroma.  The rice could be a bit more al dante, but that's really a personal preference.  We got the local wine (cab) and it was also good (for $46 per bottle).  The Crème Brulle was a very small portion.  Well made and just the right size."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite restaurant.  I've been twice now and the waiter remember me by name about 6 months after my first visit.  Great, attentive service, nice ambience, great food, reasonable prices.  You will not be disapointed.  White linens, italian music and candles.  You should have full confidence taking your boss, spouse or dignatary to this place.  5 Stars!  Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Let me start this review with a proviso. I'm not an aficionado of Italian cuisine. I find it kind of boring. I wish that French cuisine had obtained the ubiquitous \"fine-dining\" default space that Italian is currently resting in. People must really love pasta.  Anyway, the service was lovely. Warm, attentive, and jovial. Everything you could want from a good server.   The food itself was not to my taste. I ordered the veal piccata. It was drowning (positively drowning) in butter. There was enough butter here to slather on toast for everyone in the restaurant at the time. That's just too much. It was heavy and oily. The delicate flavours of the veal, lemon, and capers were hidden by this buttery tsunami. I've had piccata before and it wasn't anywhere near this buttery. I don't know which is the more authentic, but I have to say, I prefer the less buttery version.   I should have just went with a steak. Unless it was drowned in butter like the veal."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very Italian in decoration in a very homey way.  The appetizers were AMAZING, the first course of risotto was the most AMAZING risotto I have ever had.  The main course of Veal chop and and incredible fish dish was also AMAZING.  The wine list was AMAZING and the desserts were you guessed it AMAZING.  The most AMAZING part of our evening was our server Antonio, he knew absolutely everything about the various dishes and he knew the perfect wine to accompany every dish....  The entire evening was you guessed it AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING"}
{"text":"Valentine's Day Dinner over the weekend, there was even a proposal that happened- she said Yes! Came in and a man was playing the trumpet and they had beautiful music playing as well and he added to it. Seated at a table, started off with wine. Then had an antipasto platter - to die for! The calamari was soft and cooked to perfection. Bread at the table was warm said my boyfriend. I had a Gluten Free rice pasta, with rose sauce and fresh bacon pieces inside of it. Too full for dessert - food was to die for. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my friends and I had a very poor experience here. We came for a friend's birthday, and we were severely neglected (my theory is due to our age - we were the youngest group there). It took an hour for someone to come and ask if we wanted wine (by that point we were more than ready to order food), when our food was brought out the environment was quite loud and we were being yelled at for not saying \"mine\" when the dish was named. We asked to see a dessert menu at the end of our meal, and it was clear the servers were annoyed that we opted not to have anything, as they said \"Really, no coffee, chai, espresso?\" As they angrily removed the dessert menus. It took another 45 minutes before someone finally came around and we could ask for our bill, and while we specified very clearly it was all separate, one bill was brought. It took another 30 minutes before our separate bills were finally brought. All the other tables around us had prompt service, servers attended to them consistently. Overall severely disappointed in our experience and the lack of service we received, and we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I hosted a large private dinner at Alioli with 50+ of our Toronto partners. Great atmosphere, great service, and DELICIOUS food. Massimo was a pleasure to work with and we will definitely be back. It was a very comfortable space."}
{"text":"Great Italian taste. Nice ambience. And we liked the live music. All the food we had was well cooked. A lot of families and friends on different tables - so a good place for all."}
{"text":"Servers definitely have issues in this restaurant you can see it in review over review but I don't understand why some critic still gives 5 stars.   All servers when outside to check out customer fancy car. Oh wow and ppl are waiting! Ask for red wine come to me with white and say it tastes better, eh!! Definitely a mistake don't want to take.   Beside the service, foods are only ok. Great Italian place for Italian with no choice to go in Mississauga. Food have nothing special, Chef definitely needs an update on what's out there - just go young or yorkville.   Return - rare."}
{"text":"This place actually lived up to the hype and was EXACTLY what we were looking for. Classy atmosphere, delicious fresh tasting food and excellent service. The perfect place to celebrate a birthday with your family.  Within the first 15 minutes of sitting down in Alioli we saw not one, but two birthday cakes with candles go to different parties of people which was a good sign for us since that's what we were there for as well.  Our waiter, an older gentleman, was full of charisma. He made us feel comfortable, taken care of, and was very friendly without intruding on our meal. He also met an allergy request with no problem and didn't make us feel rushed when we couldn't make a decision on our entrees. In fact he encouraged us to just wait until we had finished the first course to even order. Despite our late order entrees arrived just 10-15 minutes are our appetizer was finished. Perfect.  We ordered the appetizer platter (recommended!) and it was enough for all 7 of us to have a taste of everything. The main courses were delicious. The veal was tender and grilled to perfection, the pastas were light and flavourful and the pizzas for one were full of bright fresh ingredients.  I was impressed with this restaurant and would definitely recommend this as a place to take a group for a nice meal."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work and look to Yelp to help me find great restaurants to visit while in different cities.  I read the reviews for this restaurant and decided to give it a try.  I still cannot understand the other reviews of this restaurant being so positive!    It wasn't awful but I would never go back.  There are far better choices.  The service I received was terrible.  The waiter was very inattentive and the food took quite awhile to come out.  The menu was quite limited for an Italian restaurant.  The food was average at best.  The mashed potatoes tasted like they were made from powder and not from fresh potatoes.    I was very unimpressed."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!   Attire - This restaurant is pretty flexible they do not enforce a dress code, but generally people are on the dressier side.  Mains -  Risotto al funghi voleva la pena was a little too rich for me, however their Pizza Pastore is incredible! It was light, crispy and full of flavour!  Desert -  Their Creme Brule is a little on the heavy side, especially after a big meal but their Tiramisu is to DIE for! If you're eating here make sure you save room for desert!  Service -  Always excellent! They have a well trained staff who knows their menu inside and out! They are always courteous and well polished!  Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Great place! Nice ambiance, food was amazing and our server Antonio was the BEST! The antipasto, steak and pasta were delicious. They accommodated our group of 10 last minute no problem. We will definitely be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Service really slow. However the chicken dinner was very well seasoned and the sides were well done. The chicken supreme was well stuffed and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Now this place was a surprise.  It's kind of hidden but the food is great and the atmosphere was awesome.  For all the wine drinkers make sure your try their wine called Ass Kisser.  Definately going to go there again."}
{"text":"Great location downtown city center. My girlfriend and I visited recently for the first time. The restaurant is sophisticated and welcoming. The staff are attentive and friendly and the food is amazing. We were welcomed, advised of the specials and brought a fresh bread basket to start. I ordered the Mushroom Risotto and my friend had the Gnocchi con Gamberi , gnocchi with cream sauce, Both were melt in your mouth delicious. No room for dessert. Nice patio in the good weather."}
{"text":"The servers are excellent. Know how to carry a wine glass by the base and not the glass. The food is excellent and tastes like real Italian food.  Highly recommend.  They do have gluten free pasta.  My coworker and I both licked our plates clean."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time on a Saturday night. Service was excellent. I had a ceasar salad to start and the jumbo ravioli as my main course. Such a great spot for date night. The decor was nice and it was dimly lit (not as dark as The Keg though). It wasn't too busy or noisy."}
{"text":"Meh, for the price and the reviews on Yelp I wasn't impressed at all with this place. There was live music but it was so loud that I couldn't even hear my girlfriend from the other side of the table.   The pasta we got was mediocre at best, over salted and nothing to write home about. I don't think I'll ever come back here, it is definitely not worth the money and this is not a good place for a romantic date because it is very difficult to have a conversation over all the background noise.  Better off going to chuck-e-cheese 10/10."}
{"text":"Unbelievably great food, service, and ambiance.  I'm fairly certain that everything on the menu is worth trying - but the lamb will knock your socks off.  Incredible.  I just left and I already want to go back."}
{"text":"3.5* I came in with high hope's for Alioli seeing as there were so many great reviews. To start, Alioli is very small with a max of 12-15 tables at most, all of which were very crowded together. Decor was not newly renovated, but definitely gave off a homely feel. Service was amazing, all the waiters we're really friendly, knowledgeable, and had great senses of humors (who doesn't love being called Bella all night haha). The live music was definitely my favorite part, probably one of the best live operas I've heard at a restaurant. We came in a table of 10 so I luckily got to sample a few dishes. Gnocchi was good, but nothing spectacular. The pesto pasta (forgot the name) tasted really bitter, too much garlic maybe? Calamari was good, a loaded dish that tasted as I had expected. Risotto was good, reminded me of mushroom soup? but again, nothing mind blowing. Caprese salad was good, have nothing to complain about this dish. Lastly for deserts, I ordered the molten chocolate cake and creme brulee. Both we're definitely really good and good sized portions. Creme brulee was creamy and crunchy just like i like, and topped with plenty of fruit. Overall a good experience, I really want to come back here on a date. Not so much with the whole family as I feel like it kind of ruined the romantic ambience. 3.5* for the food I tried along with the amazing service. i hope to raise this up soon when I visit next!"}
{"text":"Overall: 4/5 The big question I kept asking myself: Why haven't I found Alioli earlier?! Tucked away in an unassuming building is a perfect authentic Italian restaurant that apparently has been around for ages, and rightfully so! Alioli wins in both service, ambience, and taste. I am excited to return and try other dishes!   Taste: 4/5  I came here with a friend and we both opted for the vegetarian pastas that night. She ordered the Risotto con Funghi and I opted for the Jumbo Ravioli. Both were DELICIOUS. My friend isn't a fan of Italian food or pastas but she really enjoyed her dish. I tried a small amount of her dish and can see why - the risotto was perfectly done (and I don't even LIKE risotto), with the flavours pairing wonderfully. On the same note, I really loved my ravioli dish! The creaminess of the dish was just enough to keep me satisfied and full.   Service: 4/5 All the servers at Alioli were welcoming, knowledgeable, and pleasant. I arrived earlier than my friend and managed to strike up some conversation with a few of the servers. It was apparent that everyone loved working there and also worked hard to ensure that each patron's experience was enjoyable. Considering that the place was quite full, our food also came out at an appropriate pace (bread appetizers first).   Ambience: 4/5 Decor gives the place an upscale, classy feel. This is a perfect place for a date for 2, or groups!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally visited this restaurant last week after months of putting it off. Good thing we finally dined here because this place has the best Grilled Squid appetizer! On the menu, it is listed as \"Calamari Alla Griglia\". The squid is succulent and perfectly tender. It came on a bed of chopped tomatoes, capers, and mixed greens. My dear husband and I both loved it and I highly recommend it to anyone especially seafood lovers.  For the main course, I had Linguine Pasta with Rapini (Linguine con Rapini) since I wasn't up for a meat dish. The fresh pasta was pretty good and I like that the sauce wasn't too heavy. I'd love to try their meat dish particularly the Osso Buco the next time we visit. As expected, my husband who is a risotto fan, had Risotto al Prosecco. The dish had mushrooms, shrimps, and artichokes in a lobster bisque. He was pretty satisfied with his meal, too.  For dessert, we shared a Tiramisu. My husband paired it with a cup of espresso while I had tea. It was the perfect way to end the meal. The tiramisu was just right. It had a good balance of  mascarpone cheese, espresso and cookies.   We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We went as a group of 4 and ordered the Frittura Mista $19Deep fried marinated squid, shrimp, white fish crusted in corn flour. I also ordered the special on the menu which is a grilled fish on the menu and it tasted too salty. Overall it was not bad, but the it would have tasted better if the dishes were less salty."}
{"text":"Alioli has become a regular stop for myself and my friends. Service is beyond reproach; and the quality of their food is impeccable. If you get a chance ask for Tony and let him take care of your menu for you.  You won't be disappointed. One suggestion, the veal chop is to die for."}
{"text":"Found it by mistake and decided to try it out I was not disappointed was the best pasta I've had in any restaurant hands down."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. The waiters were plain rude! Never coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday at 6:30pm with a reservation.   The restaurant had a more elegant ambience than I expected. The ambience is in line with the menu prices though ;) The restaurant was was dimly lit and would be a good setting for a romantic night out, except that it was noisy - apparently it was busier than usual though since it was the 2nd last day for the Buytopia promotion.   The complimentary bread and dessert were the highlights for me.  We ordered: *Pizza Pastore appetizer - goat cheese, bell pepper, sun-dried tomato, pesto sauce. Good overall and I liked that they split it into 2 plates for my husband and I.  *Spaghetti Pescatore - pasta with a generous portion of scallops, calamari, crab, and shrimp. Good tomato sauce. *Atlantic Salmon with potato and veggies - husband enjoyed it *Chocolate bomb - chocolate lava cake with ice cream for a satisfying end to the meal :)  Service was quick and friendly.   We had a Buytopia voucher ($49 for 1 appetizer & 2 mains) so saved about $25. Total cost without the deal would have been $89 before taxes/tip for the above dishes + 1 Coke -- definitely on the expensive side but nice for a special occasion or treat."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. The staff here is extremely courteous and efficient and deem to have passion for their work. The food here is pretty straightforward Italian fare but sometimes that's all that's needed. Simple food created with good ingredients. They've been around a long time and continue to impress with great food and service. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Dinner at Alioli always a fun time. Great servers, warm and friendly welcome with delicious cuisine. Just enjoyed a whole fish Oratta. Amazing! Alioli in the heart of Mississauga close to Square One, I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Note that this review does not include the food quality - because we did not make it there. Came here tonight (Canada day long weekend), and the doors were locked. An employee came out and said that they are closed, they close at 9:30. The time was 9:32 and they had refused to even let us inside the restaurant, didn't apologize, just stated it as a matter of fact."}
{"text":"Food was great but waiters are very inappropriate. I won't recommend to friends or family. Waiters are all older men with no knowledge of what political correctness looks like."}
{"text":"As a daughter of Italian parents, I don't go out to eat Italian, but this place makes me want to.  It's painted a bit too \"sun-dried tomato red\" for me, but I guess it's all part of its charm. Risotto al funghi voleva la pena."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good service. Food a little on the pricey side considering it's in mississauga. Ordered a ceasar salad, steak and a desert and it cost around $65 after using their discount coupon.   On the fence on whether to come back"}
{"text":"Now this is service!!  Excellent food, waitstaff was superior, cool and sleek fellow patrons. Next to us was a table of ten who ordered 15 bottles of wine and the waiter decanted each one - very cool!!   Buffalonians be aware - it is Toronto, so there is smoking - something we don't see here anymore.  The couple next to us had 2 packs of cigarettes between them, 4 espressos and tiramasu.  Just sayin'............  This is not a tourist place- most everyone was a regular (the place is surrounded by 15 high rises), and everyone was kissed and hugged.    Everything our table had was fabulous- mushroom risotto, shrimp scampi, pasta bolognese, gnocchi.  But the antipasti dish for $34.00 was worth every penny.  Grilled calamari, crab cakes, olives, cheese, prosciutto grilled with mozzarella..yummy bread.....list goes on.  Delicioso!"}
{"text":"Went today for the first time, for a birthday party and the service was excellent and the food was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Highly recommended. Just make reservations early,  don't be late and prepare your wallet for some spending because it is pricey, but worth it !"}
{"text":"Alioli has been open at the corner of Confederation Parkway and Burnhamthorpe for many years. This Italian restaurant features a wide variety of traditional and Northern Italian dishes. The food quality is good and the prices are average to a bit on the pricey side. Service is good and for some reason the only time I have visited this place is with large groups. We recently reserved a table for 10 for Thanksgiving and the overall experience was good. There is an automatic gratuity of 18% which seems a little high and I never understood why that is the case. There was one waiter looking after us with a couple of food runners. If we were there with a group of 4 people we would have tipped at most 15%, based on the service which was average and not outstanding.  Alioli really has no competition in the immediate area. It is certainly better than any Italian places within a few kilometers and overall I would really have given it a 3.5."}
{"text":"Had worst dining experience ever! Never coming back.  I eat out often & this place was the worst.  We waited over an hour to order & almost 2hrs for our food (bc our waiter didnt put the order in).... The tables beside & behind us came in, orderd, ate & left before us. I was ready to leave aftr the 1st hour but my date knew the GM personally so we were reassured it was all going to be sorted out asap & would be worth it.  It wasn't.  I had lost my appetite by the time we were served so couldn't even enjoy the meal (which they had also brought out incorrectly btw).  Then after all that,  we weren't even offered a comp meal or discount for such an unpleasant experience. Would give it no stars if i could."}
{"text":"Immediately upon entering this fine dining restaurant you are greeted and you truly feel welcome.  The staff is very attentive and successes in making you feel right at home.  Service was always with a smile and always anticipating your needs.  The food started with antipasto of grilled shrimp, grilled calamari, olives, cheeses, fried crab cakes and of course tomatoes with fresh mozzarella.  Great starter that pair wonderfully with the wine.  I had to order the osso buco which was served with risotto.  I rarely see osso buco on anyone's menu these days I had to order it and I was not disappointed.  their version is made with veal shank and the meet was sweet and tender.  It was what was needed for a long day and week of meetings on the road.  My colleague's dishes were just as appetizing especially the salmon and home made gnocchi which I must try the next time I am in town.  This is a great establishment to visit and share a meal and enjoy the great service and food."}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM...finally!  I haven't been surprised by a place in a while.  Apparently Alioli has been around for 19 years, so why haven't I gone??  Maybe partially 'cause I think Italian restos are kinda overpriced/taking it for granted/forgo it to try other places?     As soon as I stepped in, for dinner, I was asked if I had reservations...on a Monday...in Mississauga.  However, truth be told, restaurant was quite full during the middle of my meal.  The waiter who delivered specials of the day, did so by memory, but I could barely hear him.  Just too many dishes with lotsa details and a lot of background noise.  I wished that they were written down - WITH PRICES - so that I didn't have to inquire about that.  Water was constantly refilled.  And waiters did check it, but weren't overbearing.  Sure, one of the waiter was slightly surly/has a specific sense of humour, but after chatting with him, he's been there for 13 years and is sometimes rudely summoned by patrons while he's in the middle of collecting a cheque.    (Sometimes you gotta understand people before dismissing them as \"rude\", \"giving bad service\", etc.)  Dishes arrived shortly after ordering, I'd say within 10mins.  Penne a la Vodka ($21) was nice 'n creamy, good 2 portions full.  I ate a little bit more than half of my plate.  I had a taste of the Pizza Pastore ($17) and it was nice 'n thin, althought I preferred my pasta.  Place is NOT cheap,  see:  white table clothes/napkins.  So I know it's not a place that I'm going to frequent.  It would be nice for a higher-end business meal or bday or date night.  Each app was at least $12-15 with pastas in the $20-25 range and fish/meat dishes in the $25-30 range.  Sorta like Keg prices.  Minus stars for somewhat loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I came here last week with my parents and was happy. I enjoyed my lamb, kale salad and plenty of good wine. The place is rather festive in the evenings so do keep that in mind when you make a reservation. Will be back when in town."}
{"text":"Went there for a relative's wedding anniversary. The special was a chicken pasta in rich tomato cream gravy. It was basically butter chicken gravy. Not impressed. The tiramisu and pizza was nice though."}
{"text":"Amazing food nice place not to loud. Pasta very tasty staff very friendly. I had the mushroom stuffed huge ravioli and it was amazing"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Meals are priced  reasonably. Potato & leek soup was amazing. Complimentary bread tasted good. Jumbo ravioli is a must.   The only -1 for me is that the tiramisu & cappucino I got was a little too sweet. But other than that, the dining experience was great!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday party. We had 15 people in our group and they were pretty accommodating considering we didn't have reservations (on a Saturday night around 9pm). We had tried to pre book but at the time they were full so we took our chances, waited about 45mins and they were able to whip up an area for all of us to sit. The service was good and pretty quick. Everyone was quite happy with what they ordered to eat. They have a pretty intense menu, I suggest looking ahead of time online so you have a better idea of what you may want."}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriend birthday. They did an amazing job with service and accommodations for 18 people. The food was spectacular and amazingly priced for the quality. This is an authentic Italian restaurant. Beautiful atmosphere, classy and elegant. Will definitely return again"}
{"text":"Alioli is pretty good. portions are good but the restaurant is a bit noisy. the waiters are amazing and work as a team very well.   Lots of appetizers and wine to choose from."}
{"text":"5 stars for this missisauga authentic Italian restaurant. Restaurant's been around for a long time. Extremely friendly and knowledgable staff. some nights have live soothing music more of a romantic joint then casual dinner because of the decor.   Everything on the menu is worth trying. I've done so myself. the wine list is well stacked with quality and Im sure they have an abundance of other wines that are not on the menu. Better to book ahead because seating is limited. It's the kind of place that takes care of their customers and gives you that real intimate experience  My first experience with Grapa"}
{"text":"The calamari was excellent and the pasta was fresh. The waiters were very professional and the atmosphere is always tranquil and elegant. I love going there with my fiancee and for our corporate Christmas parties."}
{"text":"It's been a Mississauga staple for awhile, and I finally made my way out to it for the first time recently.  If you're looking for a cozy, romantic date spot - this is it. Dim-lit, quiet and on the fancier side, this is a great spot for a nice Italian dinner.  The host greets you and takes your coats when you walk in. Customer service seems to be good.  The pasta was al dente and delicious, no disappointments.  The down side - weren't able to make a lychee martini (c'mon, it's just vodka and soho, guys!)   Parking is plentiful as its in a big office building.  All in all, will return!"}
{"text":"What a spectacular night it was!!! On Monday evening, the restaurant was quite empty, but we didn't mind it as we wanted an intimate dinner as it was our anniversary.  The service was wonderful and the manager came to talk to us twice.   We had the soup of the day which was tomato based with clams, seafood and some veggies. It was light, but tasteful. I could have eaten another bowl. We were sharing it, so they were nice enough to give it to us in 2 separate bowls.   I ordered grilled chicken with sun dried tomatoes with a pesto sauce penne dish and it didn't disappoint. The pasta was tender and flavourful! It was just the right amount of pasta (even though I took some home as I didn't want to be too full).   My partner had the tomato sauce with spaghetti and seafood. He also loved it and because he was anxious and nervous, he too didn't finish it. Why?? Well... he surprised me in a big way by asking me 2 special questions.   Verdict:  Great food and great memories!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Calling all pasta lovers cursed with Celiac disease or a gluten intolerance! Look no further for a delicious meal where neither you nor your gluten-friendly dining partners have to compromise on flavour.   I've had the Quinoa al Pomodoro on three separate occasions, and I've switched the sauce to Rose twice. Their quinoa pasta is flavorful and has the perfect texture  (not too soft nor chewy, as gluten free pasta often can be).  As a vegetarian, I've eaten many gluten free pasta dishes that leave me wondering why favour was left out of the equation. Not so for this dish!   I can't speak to their other dishes from personal experience, but my boyfriend (who also abhors bland food) has enjoyed various pasta dishes and risotto from Aioli.   The staff are friendly, professional, prompt, and accommodating. The seating is cozy, classy, and romantic. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My company always books our departmental Christmas lunch at this restaurant.  When they ask us if we prefer a change of scenery, I vote no.    The antipasta is great, and they have an excellent risotto.  The service is not as good as the food, but adequate.  On certain evenings they have live music."}
{"text":"Interior well designed for a classic fine dining experience, however unimaginative.  Nice outdoor patio although it currently looks out into condo construction.    The service has always been satisfactory.  The (I think) general manager seemed to be upset all the time, I get the feeling that he thinks the restaurant is finer dining than it actually is...  The food is about a 7 out of 10.  Prepared well, would expect slightly better ingredients for the price paid.  There is no doubt that here you are paying more for experience than food.  I'd come here for a beer flatbread with a friend or date and sit on the patio.  For the same food at better value you might head to Grano Ristorante a few blocks away."}
{"text":"This fancy Italian restaurant located in the heart of Mississauga was a splendid surprise. I went here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. We had an amazing time and quite enjoyed the food. Some random points:  - there's live music! A performer played some nice tunes on the saxophone and clarinet - the complimentary bread is super addictive - the menu isn't super strict and you are allowed to substitute some items in the dishes within reasonable limits (we were allowed to change the spaghetti to fettuccine) - the pizzas are thin crust and quite filling - the waiters are very friendly and check up on you regularly - the squid appetizers are very tasty although a little pricey in my opinion  - the decor is very nice - make sure you come well dressed to take nice pictures and to fit in with most of the customers who come in quite well dressed"}
