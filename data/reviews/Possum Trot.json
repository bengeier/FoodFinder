{"text":"I ate here on a Sunday afternoon and was not impressed. The regular meal prices were exorbitant. Fish and chips were upwards of $20. I just got a bowl of crab bisque to keep the cost down, but it tasted like they'd dumped a container of salt into it.   My mom got the Sunday Special, which was priced at $13.95. This wasn't too bad for a plate of chicken and noodles, mashed potatoes, green beans, and dessert. Except it was noodles sans chicken, instant potatoes, greasy green beans, and unsweetened blackberry cobbler.  And while I always appreciate the effort to provide quality live music, a pianist hammering out Bruno Mars at a ridiculous volume does not do anything for anyone. I like to be able to converse with my lunch companions.   So, needless to say, we will not be coming back. The food was poor and absolutely not worth the price. The only redeeming factor was the bread, which they set out as soon as we sat down. I was hungry enough at the time to eat the tablecloth (which would have tasted similar to those potatoes.)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  I had the prime rib and it was good.  Rest of my party had ribs, ribeye, and scallops. No one complained and everyone raved.  Only reason I didn't vote 5 stars was for the fact they have no draft beer only bottles.  Oh well no one is perfect.  We'll be returning to this place for sure."}
{"text":"Went with my wife.  From 4-6 they have this thing called the early bird special.  Nice because prices were much more affordable than later, and serving sizes were still humongous.    Ordered pork chop and it was the size of a dinosaur thigh, and a prime rib that was thicker than a Dan Brown novel.  The vegetables were a little scarce.  Meat is obviously the main focus, which is not necessarily bad at all.  Had salad and bread and the penny's worth of veggies.  Appetizer of portabello mushroom fries was extremely good too.  We recommend this place to anyone who is willing to spend a little more for a hunk of a size of meat, and nice quiet setting.  Pastas and seafood dishes were in between 10 and 20 dollars.  If you are going to get meat not on the early bird special then plan on paying a good amount."}
{"text":"This place is a sad joke. It cost as much as a nice restaurant ($25/person) but was definitely not that quality. The steak was tough and gristly and my asparagus was both burned and tough. We were highly disappointed."}
{"text":"We decided on a whim to eat here tonight, everything was really good. I had the filet Oscar and my husband has the ribeye which he said was really very good also.  Enjoyed the salad and the bread was tasty."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Best restaurant in town. Great food at reasonable prices. We eat there so often I told the owner they need a \"frequent flyer\" program. Lol"}
{"text":"Most people in Indiana have heard of The Beef House well did you know that Little Brother of the Wright clan bought his own place and is giving Big Brother at the Beef a run for his $?  The Infamous Possum Trot is now owned by the younger Wright boy. I am serious about Infamous. The Possum Trot has been around for many generations and has been threw nearly as many reinventions as Madonna. It started out as a Miner Bar/Roadhouse back in the 20's or 30's and had quite a REPUTATION  (good girls wouldn't be caught dead there ;) But it's checkered past is way in the past, and now especially after the Wrights revamped the menu and the exterior it's a reasonably swanky hot spot in Vermilion Co.    You can't go wrong with the Steaks. Their signature house dressing is still the same, and their new addition of portabella fries on the apps menu rocks.   They still need to work on the interior, their trying with linen table cloths, but the truck stop chairs really ruin the high end vibe they are aspiring toward.   **When there's an hour wait at the Beef house you can bet it's half that or less at The Possum Trot and you'll be getting virtually the same steak."}
{"text":"Our meal and service were excellent. Had the queen cut prime rib, it was divine. Will be back love the ambiance."}
{"text":"I've been to the Possum Trot now twice, and for the life of me, I can't understand what makes people want to spend money here.  Bland food and poor service at a high price are not a winning combination for me.  A little background info: When I write my reviews I break them down in to different categoriest and rate each one separately, then average the ratings. Another thing I don't do is give a restaurant (or any business for that matter)  a higher rating because they are in the mid-west or because it is a small town etc. I won't say, well, for Danville it's good. Restaurants here or in Paris or Rome get the same treatment from me.  Location: Possum Trot is located on the west side of Danville a little ways out of town. It's located on a random country road that doesn't seem to be close to anything. There is absolutely no way you could get here other than in a car. I seriously don't understand what the draw is to go to a restaurant so far outside of town and what the draw is for restaurant owners to locate so far away. What's wrong with downtown (before you tell me downtown is too seedy, think about how it would be if businesses such as this located there)? Perhaps if this was more a a picturesque area it would be different, but as far as I am concerned, this is not an attractive location.    Rating: 2 Stars  Exterior Appearance: Was this once a bank with a drive through? I am pretty sure the architectural style of this building is 1980s strip mall bank. The parking lot is dirt, or mostly dirt and the building is bland and boring. Still, the building is in good shape, is clean, and the grounds and parking lot are clean.  Rating: 3 Stars  Interior Appearance: Basically follows the lead of the exterior. For the life of me I can't remember if there is a decorating style or if it is just a big room. I do remember the awful greenish, bluish, industrial strength office carpet on the floor. Seriously, office carpet? I hate to think what is living in there. It did appear clean and the walls and furniture were in good shape.  Rating 3 Stars  Service: Horrible! Both times I went there the service was just utterly terrible. I've had better service at the big boy. We had a big group and the server dropped the ball several times. Forgotten, drinks, incorrect drinks, ignoring us, the list continues. Two of the worst things though, were that our server bonked me in the head with a serving tray. The other thing was that the server came and took drink orders and after taking two she just walked off and ignored the rest of the people. She never cam back either with the first two drinks. The server was also completely unable to recommend a dish, a beer, or recommend wine with what we were ordering. For $28 an entree you better be able to provide some direction...inexcusable.  Rating: 1 Star  Menu: Typical \"American\" steakhouse. Pretty broad with some seafood, but the them of all of it is meat and fat. You want your steak tastier? Throw some cheese on it. Or how about some butter sauce? Nothing creative at all. Nothing spicy. Nothing deviating from that thin line that is bland cooking. My recommendation is to stick to the steaks, it's what they do best.  Rating: 2 Stars  Wine List, Cocktails and Beers: Pretty safe, uninteresting wine list, consisting mostly of sweetish, simple wines. The value is pretty good though. Stay away from the whites though. I think they were pouring them all from a box of Franzia.  The liquor selection and cocktail list is completely blah. No interesting cocktails that I could see, and no interesting spirits. The beer selection, however, bails out the rest. A decent beer selection, with things like Sam Adams, Goose Island and Sierra Nevada. Not a great list, but not bad.  Rating: 3 Stars  Food: The quality is fine, although I'd guess that the food comes from Sysco or Food Services of America. There is nothing here close to the concept of farm to table, seasonal, free range or wild. Everything is straight forward and flavored using salt, fat and cheese. The food tasted fine, but I can't imagine eating here more than twice a year if it were my only choice. I encourage this restaurant to try something a little more adventurous.  Rating: 2 Stars  Value: The food you get here is TGI Fridays quality with even less interesting methods of cooking. All for probably double what a chain would charge. Portion sizes are enormous however so there is that. I'd rather pay less and have a smaller bill however. This is not a good place to come if one is looking for a good value. Your going to dump a lot of money for this food.  Rating: 2 Stars  Overall Rating: 2.25, rounded down to 2."}
{"text":"Timeless decor and atmosphere inside.  Very good service and staple midwestern steakhouse food.  I had the pork chop covered in blue cheese.  Massive piece of meat for one person, but it was just a little over cooked.  I'd pass on the shrimp."}
{"text":"We thought this place was pretty good.  Steak was good.  Cajun chicken was good and spicy.  Service was good even though it was pretty crowded. The decor inside is pretty nice too.  However, they need a little help on how to make a Manhattan, but they did fine on the Martini."}
{"text":"Ordinarily I would definitely give this restaurant at least 4 stars...after my recent two visits I cannot give it 4 stars.  I have been eating at this restaurant for many years, as I grew up in this area. I would have to say my last two visits were not good.  All you can eat shrimp special last night, sad to report poor. Grilled was overcooked and had no flavor, Broiled selection nasty flavoring and pieces were puney.  However, The calamari was yummy!!! Funny, the waitress came by and asked \"how was it\" delicious, thank you and took the plate w 4-5 pieces left of the plate......nope. We weren't done and didn't ask or gesture for the plate to be removed.  I will say....its been hit or miss for the last hear w this restaurant, but when you don't have many to pick from anymore in this community......"}
{"text":"Started with the shrimp poppers with sweet chili sauce. The portion was huge and only $8.50. Main course was mahi crunch. The portion of mahi was incredibly thick and cooked perfectly. Cooked entirely thru but not dry. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"How do I semi-like thee? Let me count thy ways:  For starters: no possum on the menu! That's right. Not a possum steak, fried possum leg, nor breaded possum nuggets could be had. That's the only reason I agreed to make my premiere appearance at a D-Vegas restaurant in 2014. How do you justify naming your restaurant after a delectable rodent named Didelphis virginiana without overcharging customers to chow into a morsel of said critter? (Reminder: Didelphis virginiana is the scientific name of the ugly American beast that is really an opossum. My fellow countrymen delete the \"o\" at the beginning of the term as if it were some sort of prefix, thereby confusing residents of Australia, which is home to the real possum, i.e., Trichosurus vulpecula.)  I digress. I won't harp much longer, but not a single employee could be ogled doing a trot. Not a fox trot, nor even like a horse, was attempted by my waiter. Even after I politely asked. I casually suggested a bigger tip, but he declined and walked away wordlessly. Rude! (Despite the waiter's earlier bad boy behavior and tendency to ignore me, I graciously tipped him at the end of the meal with my phone number. Stupid wishful thinking on my part. He won't call.)  My main contention is this: I try to judge eateries by the appearance of the clientele sitting within earshot. Customers make the place, causing our collective emotions to rise as if in a den of iniquity, or plummet to boredom with serious abandonment issues. We all like being witnessed as we do fun stuff, and being around the right crowd can turn the worst establishment into a haven of bliss. I felt few hedonistic vibes by whom I noticed. To the left of me were elderly people, a few of whom seemed to have adult diapers on. With tight clothes comes great responsibility. They were clean with the scent of expensive perfume and cologne. Not that I could smell much with the grapey bottle of wine they sipped on all evening. The thought of their undergarments shouldn't have been allowed to pop into my mind. Now it's all I can think about.  The silverware looked as if it were shoplifted at Dollar General. I thought the plates were high quality until I shattered one by accident. If I had known they wouldn't bill me, I would have broken another one. Live and learn.  After much discussion with my \"friend,\" I ordered a filet mignon-- rare-- with a side of succotash and marmalade. I always eat my filets with grapefruit marmalade, which I mash out before canning, all by myself, on my days off. To my chagrin, I had to settle for orange. Either way, the pectin in the sweet spreadable fruit brings out the extra oomph that no bloody piece of meat can sustain on its own.  All in all, the food tasted like it had been frozen all year. Everything had the succor of a manufactured nature. I might as well have gone to the McDonald's drive up for all the good it did me. One must remember this is D-Vegas. At all times it is D-Vegas.  Kudos to the furniture buyer! The chair I sat in was quite comfortable. The previous customer left it warm for me, and as I always go commando on my nights out, this feeling was phenomenal. I gently spread my thighs as I wrapped my Achilles tendons and ankles around the chair legs. I must give credit where credit is due. Every time someone walked behind me, I assumed the worst. Despite my prejudices, not a single person tried pulling the chair out from under me or pushing me into the table. Not even the greaser in the torn jeans who strolled by as I dumped ketchup on my succotash. That left a far greater impression on me than I'm use to. I still had my legs locked in place, but for once it was unnecessary.  My final thought as I left was this: The parking lot was salted as much as the food. It was salt overload. You don't need that much. It's wasteful and it wasn't icy enough to justify the quantities. It's a pet peeve of mine. I don't know why they do it. I had to hose off my tires after getting home. It was that bad. Doing labor to fix a bad meal experience shouldn't even be an option. It could also explain why the prices were so high. Maybe they could hire better waiters who are skilled at moving their mouth muscles into a smile on a regular basis. Not occasionally, I need it regularly with the mood I'm always in. Improper budgeting on salt and poor parking lot maintenance seems to be the cause of so much chaos in the world. Just lower the expenditures outside and pay attention to your customer's inner needs. That's all I'm saying."}
{"text":"Truly only restaurant down state that is 5 star from appetizer to entree to dessert. Our server ,Macey , was awesome . Atmosphere was great! Piano player was good.......... Another birthday.  Great food . Brady was awesome."}
{"text":"I get both a country and big city feeling in this restaurant and that is a good thing.  I enjoy the peaceful atmosphere on the outside and the piano bar adds a lot of style to the dining experience.  As always, I enjoyed the meal and the cocktails.  It would be nice if they would add a salad bar or jazz up their salad selection.  Also, I wish  they would sell some local, craft beer."}
{"text":"Desk clerk at the Holiday Inn Express recommended this to me after I turned down the Beef House. I was a little apprehensive as I followed the road in the dark and then found the place. The name did not help either.  Special tonight was all you could eat shrimp, your choice on how they were prepared. Had them grilled and was amazed at the perfection by the chef. Even eating all along the gulf coast it is hard to find a chef who takes the time to make sure the shrimp are not overcooked and tough. These were melt in your mouth and I should have stopped after the second helping rather than going with a third. Bread was also fantastic. Service was a little slow but the place was packed on a Wednesday night. Probably would not have noticed had I been with a party rather than by myself."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times and it's been great!!! Love the piano bar on Friday nights too..I don't understand the 2 star reviews. It's a great place...."}
{"text":"I'm torn to review Possum Trot because I had one of the best filets of my life here (juicy, tender, full of flavor), as well as one of the worst filets of my life (dry, cold, flavorless) on a different day. It's definitely upscale for Danville and does have some nice cocktails. The service was good when I've been here as well. Hopefully I can go back a third time to confirm the verdict."}
{"text":"Here we are again- The Possum Trot is like a bad party-you go again and again because that's where everyone goes, but it turns out you just need to get better friends that go to better places. I can say that fortunately I wasn't paying. I got the 16 oz ribeye which i'm pretty sure was a combo from two different pieces of meat since it was placed together but not connected. Additionally one part was med rare as I requested and the other part was well, well, done. The steak was tasteless as if there hadn't put salt and pepper on it before it was placed on the grill which is a no brainer. The baked potato was small and barely filled up the plate even with the steak haphazardly placed and the salads were nothing but iceberg lettuce. My wife ordered the 8 oz Chicken and baker- I'm pretty sure this was the worst plating i've ever witnessed. Again small potato with one small boneless dry piece of grilled chicken tossed upside down off on the side of the plate- Brown and brown, yuck! Every time someone talks about how great this place is, I shake my head. It's overpriced and whoever is preparing the food needs a lesson or four. Evidently the manager is cool with subpar presentation and food that tastes like nothing. I avoid this place like the plague-"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant tucked away off I-74 near Danville. I had the 6oz Petite Fillet for $24.95. It was cooked perfectly and fork tender with a delicious flavor. The baked potato was on the small side but delicious. Our server Kayla was friendly and awesome! We will definitely be back next time we pass by! Give the Possum Trot a try, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving through on our way home from from vacation.  We saw the name on the exit sign and had to check this place out.  My husband ordered the prime rib and I had the filet.  Both were cooked perfectly and tender/juicy.  If we pass through again, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some friends treated me to this place and they are wonderful people to have done so. This is some good food. I know, I laughed when I first heard the name of this restaurant, too. But it's a cute name and the food is fabulous. The appetizer bread was what bread should be: crusty, soft and warm. The pork chops are THICK and you can get the most divine bleu cheese/butter sauce to go on them. If you love bleu cheese like I do then please try this (if you are in the area). Everyone in my party shared some of their meals so we all got a taste of different dishes this place offers. The steaks are also thick and cooked perfectly to how you like them and so flavorful and juicy. Seared sesame crusted Ahi tuna was tender, fresh and just fantastic. There was not one thing I tried that wasn't just delicious. This restaurant is what you'd call in the middle of nowhere but it does not by any means have a middle of nowhere feel. It's classy but in a comfortable way. The prices are what many would term as \"spendy\". Considering the portion size and the quality of food, however, I would consider the prices to be reasonable for what you get. The place stays busy I'm told and that's no surprise. We had around a 15-20 minute wait which isn't bad. The staff seemed very nice and familiar with many of the customers. I'm guessing this place has a lot of regulars. I can certainly see why. If I am ever in this area again (and to go here I would make a side trip) I will definitely be eating here."}
{"text":"This was a celebratory dinner of my new job & his new car...we were very pleasantly surprised! I've been to the Beef House twice and left thinking \"that was ok...but why the hype?\" I left Possum Trot thinking \"that was a great meal and I enjoyed the entire experience!\" I'm so glad we tried this place and we'll definitely go back the next time we're on I-74 heading into Illinois.   We arrived Saturday around 7pm and only had a 15-20 min. wait which the hostess accurately quoted to us. We were seated in a U-shaped booth next to the kitchen with a view of the charcoal grill. The booth had some comfort issues but I really liked watching all the food get cooked over the fire.   We started with seared ahi tuna and it was fantastic! Cooked just to a medium-rare and rolled in sesame seeds, the charcoal fire lent great flavor to the fish. It was drizzled with both teriyaki sauce and a mild creamy wasabi sauce. Warm crusty bread was also brought to the table. I ordered the butter-poached monkfish entree, which was on special (the specials are mostly on the menu, but the price is lowered). Honestly, I hadn't had this type of fish before but I'd read that it tastes like lobster so I figured I'd give it a go. It does have a texture quite similar to a lobster tail, and the taste isn't entirely dissimilar, but I'd say you'd probably get more flavor out of one of the grilled or fried items. It was served on fried rice, which was fine, but an odd choice. It was actual cheap Chinese-style fried rice with bits of egg, peas, and carrots in it. The side was a baked potato which was perfectly cooked and there were chives mixed into the sour cream, which I liked. My partner ordered the small ribeye with a salad and baked potato. He said the steak tasted awesome, but it wasn't super tender. It wasn't overly chewy either, but you could tell this wasn't a prime steak (nor was it advertised as such).   Make sure you save some room for dessert: the Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie was the best part of the meal! It wasn't a cream pie, more of a Reese's Cup pie. Lots of peanut butter, lots of chocolate, and very little of anything else. Perfect end to a great meal!   Our server did a great job. The place was packed and she had 2 larger groups, but she stopped by our table often, kept our glasses full, and brought everything we needed. She was friendly and pleasant to deal with.   I'll call the decor transitional. It still has a lot of darker wood paneling and dated aspects, but they've put in new lighting fixtures and art and there are big windows to let in light.   I'm not from the area so I won't pretend to know anything about the politics or family behind this restaurant, but the food and service spoke for themselves and were both really good. I highly recommend Possum Trot, and next time I'm in Danville, IL for work (which happens 2-3x/year) I will surely return."}
{"text":"Can't believe I am giving this place only three stars - because typically their service and food is fabulous and one of my to go places in this area.   But my last visit - Valentines Day 2015- the service was absolutely abysmal.   My father recently passed away - and was a long time customer. My husband flew in and we decided that a Valentines dinner there would be fitting tribute to my father.   Reservation was at 7:30. Hostess forgot us - or thought we were with another party and at 8:00 when we brought it to her attention - she made up for it by immediately seating us. Human error - not a problem - this I understand.   Although the place had pretty much cleared out by the time we placed our order, we waited 45 minutes for our meal. We ate and then thirty minutes passed before I summoned the manager (who was the person who seated us) to find our waitresses.   The manager was very apologetic and gracious, bought our drinks and reduced our bill significantly on the spot. Impressive and appreciated for certain.   Although we are very grateful for her gestures,  the very poor service was hard to recover from and leaving this place two hours after our reservation was disappointing, especially considering the reasons we chose the Possum Trot to begin with.   Will we go back? Yes we will. Everyone deserves a second chance and as I said, this is not typical here - just very disappointing."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years.  Just visited tonight for our 40th anniversary.  We ordered the works: appetizer was portabella mushroom fries, which were delicious.  We had the petite filet steaks, cooked to perfection.  For dessert it was limoncello marscapone cake, also scrumptious.  Prices are average for a steak place, I think our meal topped out around $84 and we each had an adult beverage.  Our excellent service was provided by Kayla, who brought everything in a timely fashion and checked on us throughout the meal.  The only downside is I watched the guy cooking on the grill pick up a floor mat and I could not see if he washed his hands in the kitchen before returning to the grill.  I'm going to hope that he did.  Also, the décor needs updated and the booths seem a bit cramped and uncomfortable for a tall gal and porky guy.  Guy is on a cane and it's hard to stand up when the seats are low and you are in a booth.  We will still return!  This is a great alternative to the crowded places in C-U!"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner and it was superb!  We started out with the Louisiana BBQ shrimp and the seared ahi tuna,  both were excellent starters which i would highly recommend! We sat at the bar and the service was good!  For dinner was the double cut pork chop with bleu cheese butter which was fantastic! Our bartender Ashley was great and makes a awesome dirty martini! Overall good experience here!!"}
{"text":"The Possum Trot Supper Club may not sound like the kind of place that you want to be associated with.  Never fear.  No opossums are involved with this undertaking.  This restaurant gets five stars for being the best local option.  The Possum Trot is a steaks and chops place.  You're not going to get anything too cutting edge here, but you are going to get a quality meal that is cooked exquisitely well.    Warm fresh-baked bread arrives shortly after you are seated at the table.  I'd recommend the house-made french roquefort on the salads (which will need a dash of pepper, and you might ask them to go easy on the cheese which often comes a little heavy).  The highlights on the menu are the grilled pork chops (there is a charcoal grill that is visible in the dining area, and the chef who operates the grill is a master at his craft, tinkering with the heat by raising and lowering the grill surface) and the seared rare tuna (unusually fresh and well prepared for a Central Illinois eatery).   You can't go wrong with the steaks either, but I am less enthusiastic about those.  Still, I think that they are the best steaks within thirty miles of Danville.  There are some delightful crust offerings that are also quite tasty.  The barbecue ribs are also very good.  On the seafood side, you can also try the scallops, any of the stuffed fish offerings and the grilled salmon.  Any of these are going to have a high quality to price ratio--certainly as high as you can expect this far away from fresh seafood.  Look for a baked sweet potato or sweet potato fries as a side for the steaks and chops.  The grilled asparagus is also quite good (but pass on the hollandaise sauce).  The only real shortfall of the Possum Trot menu is the wine and beer list.  You can get a good mixed drink, but it wouldn't hurt to have some more wine and beer offerings."}
{"text":"I know what you're probably thinking...this is some kind of small town, road kill cafe that serves chicken fried steak and soggy green bean casserole, with Coke AND Pepsi (if you're lucky).  Not. At. All. Yes, the Possum Trot is about as country as it gets and serves all the Midwest standards you've probably grown up with, but it is so much more than the overcooked steak and mashed potatoes you might be imagining. The PT is a traditional supper club with signature cocktails, seafood/beef/pork cooked to specification, decadent desserts, live music on the weekend, and great service. You gotta trust a place that sears your meat out in the open on the giant grill near the back of the restaurant for all to see. It's fun to watch and makes the whole place smell great. The brick patio in the back is a nifty place to enjoy a slow meal in warmer months; moreover, it's cozy even when there's a chill in the air thanks to the behemoth fire pit.  The hubs and I were treated to this delightfully outdated supper club by my mom and step-dad after a long day of spring cleaning at the family fishing cabin. We were tired and grubby, wearing hoodies, jeans, and tennis shoes, but we wanted a satisfying yet unpretentious meal. As we were arriving, two older couples (blue hairs, actually) walked out and didn't bat an eye at our attire. The ladies were wearing their best rayon blouses and gaudy jewelry, while their gentlemen folk were sporting their \"good\" jeans, flannels, and Carhartt jackets. They were certainly dolled up for a big Saturday double date, but they didn't judge us for being kind of a wreck. Next we saw the prom queen and her bestie, both in gowns and tiaras. Again, no one gave us the hairy eyeball. Later on I saw a white dude with dreadlocks and tattoos at a table next to a snooty-looking young couple who were probably celebrating their 2nd anniversary. At the Possum Trot, you can definitely come as you are. All the while, a perfectly pleasant pianist played Frank Sinatra, Elton John, and Beach Boys tunes. It was a hoot.  Now for the food: Every table gets a loaf of fresh-from-the-oven, homemade rosemary bread. The server brought our drinks without delay, and we took our time decided what to order. Ultimately we ended up with the double cut pork chop (it could probably easily feed three hungry people), the steak Oscar with lump crab meat and Hollandaise, sweet and spicy shrimp (barely breaded, juicy, tender, so much better than the strip mall Chinese shrimp you might be picturing), and the Thai chicken lettuce wraps. Everyone stole bites from each other's plate and no one could pick a favorite; they were all so good. All four dishes were perfectly prepared and so flavorful. I was shocked.  I'm honestly baffled by the negative Yelp reviews of the Possum Trot. So to bring some clarity, here's a little context: The night before, hubby and I enjoyed drinks and appetizers at Girl and the Goat in Chicago's West Loop with a few friends. It was divine. The next day we cleaned the fishing cabin and dined at the Possum Trot. Although the atmosphere and menu are vastly different than G & G, the food is nearly as marvelous."}
{"text":"This is a great place that's not easy to find! Downtown Danville doesn't have many good restaurants but go east or west a few miles and you will be happy you did.  This is an old fashioned dinner club, with plenty of parking and good lighting within. My server Macey was excellent and so was the food. I got stuffed tilapia with hollandaise sauce but the highlight was the Brussels sprouts which I normally don't like. Try them, you'll like them!"}
