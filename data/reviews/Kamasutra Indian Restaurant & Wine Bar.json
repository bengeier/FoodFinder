{"text":"Tried lunch here a couple of weeks ago. Have not had Indian often but the lunch special was good value. Lots of food and it was yummy. It was very quiet so a good place to go if you want to have a good chat. 

Not sure if I'd go back for dinner - depends on price."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I've had in Toronto. Best service, too. Love their chicken masala, and chicken vindaloo that's the hottest but most satisfying dish I have enjoyed here. Can't wait to go back... For the umpteenth time. Oh, I forgot, Indian beer complements all the great dishes."}
{"text":"best Indian restaurant.  Price is reasonable.  Much better than The Host.  Tandoori Chicken and their butter chicken is to die for.  I tried the Vandaloo lamb and it was so flavourful.  Love this place.  I live in Ajax and we would drive down just to have amazing food"}
{"text":"We had a lovely night with a few friends dining at Kamasutra. It is a local favourite for our friends that live near Bayview and Eglinton. Our appetizers came out within 5 minutes of ordering them with complementary garlic and herb nhan bread.  I was extremely impressed with how fast the food came out and how delicious it was.  The apps we had were giant samosas , splitting two between four people was perfect and some deep fried brie cheese.  For the mains we had veal vinadaloo, butter chicken and curry veggies.  Veal Vindalooo  was super spicy buy with meaning, not any unnecessary spice.  Two orders of butter chicken as it is a favourite and there isn't really enough chicken for four in one order.  We destroyed both of the butter chicken dishes quite easily.  The curry veggies were also a hit and made us feel like we were being healthy."}
{"text":"Really GREAT food.  The atmosphere, the ambiance and decor is very romantic.  My husband and I just had our anniversary dinner last week and thoroughly enjoyed the food, wine and service.  Alex, our server really took care of us.  He was very helpful choosing from the menu.  Ask for him by name.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a beautiful deco and vibe...but sadly that's where it ends... Keeping in mind that it is priced more on the higher side, expectations have to be met. Food was nice, not awful, not great. Service was bad.. In our case, after having received probably the worst service in recent memory, we still decided to leave a decent tip. What blew us off completely was when our server asked us rudely if there was anything wrong for the reason why we didn't tip her more...Seriously...This after spending over 60 bucks on a dinner!"}
{"text":"It's always a toss up between Kamasutra or Amaya Indian Room as they are in walking distance. Tonight, it was Kamasutra as I had a coupon!
The last time we were there, we had gotten our app. but waited over 30 mins for our mains...with not even a single word from our server. Needless to say, I was pissed and asked the man at the bar for the bill to pay for our app. Long story short, the manager got us our meal to go and we didn't have to pay. If it was not for him, I would def. be going to Amaya from then on.
We got the coconut calamari app. to start and it was good. I am not a fan of seafood so for me to say it was good is a compliment!
I had the veal vindaloo and asked for it to be extra spicy... it wasn't. Usually the veal is in the melt-in-your-mouth type, but tonight, it wasn't. Baby cows these days are gettin tougher I guess! 
The butter chicken was just like tomato sauce and cream to me.....it really lacked the depth and melding of flavors that a good butta' chicken should have.
Every other time we have been there,  we received comp. gaaa-lic naan....not this time!?!?!?!?! 
Overall, the price was good (even better with the coupon), and the server was great!
I love the decor of the place...rich, bold and sexy,,,,,too bad I can't say the same about the food."}
{"text":"Compared with other Indian restaurants in the area this place offers a good variety of options in their menu at a mid price. The service was excellent, really friendly people however the overall decoration of the place looks a bit cheap, it is just a square room with no particular design. The amount of food they give you is perfect and they serve it it hot \"fryers\". We ordered Tandoori chicken and seekh kebabs they serve it with all the rest of the ingredients used to cook it such as onions, peppers and kale. We didn't had any curry so I cannot comment on that but at least what we ordered was delicious. It is a bit difficult to find a place to park outside but if you are willing to walk some blocks the place is very recommendable."}
{"text":"The best Indian dinner experience in GTA. The staff is very warm and pleasant. The ambiance is alluring. I will keep going to this restaurants for years to come. I have been to this place so many times and each time I come home after an amazing experience"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the Indian food and service here.  I like the samosas, the Sufiyani Salmon and I'm always a fan of the Biryani.  The staff are friendly and usually fast.  I notice there is also a constant stream of people who do take-away."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, only four tables were seated but the server on duty was totally overwhelmed. We were hoping to be in and out in under an hour. But we were there for almost 2 hours because the service was so slow. I had the butter chicken lunch special. It was delicious. Really fresh naan. It was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Brie Pakoras! This restaurant has amazing and delicious Indian food; the service is also incredible. It's a great restaurant for family gatherings or date nights. I've gone here for so many occasions and the people I bring always want to come back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  However, I would never again go to the restaurant.  We had a reservation for 5 at 7 - we got our food at 8:15.  The restaurant was almost completely empty, so there was no crowd to serve.  I suppose that all of the staff's attention was on filling delivery and take out orders.  it was absolutely bizarre to sit in an empty restaurant on a Sunday night and get virtually no service at all.  I have been going to this restaurant for more than a decade, but tonight was the last night."}
{"text":"Their delivery is always late!!!! I ordered the first time and they said, they had too many customers in the evening. So I overlooked that and ordered another time and guess what, late again by an hour!!!! Shittiest restaurant ever! It doesn't matter if you have the best food, which u don't, time is really important!"}
{"text":"It was my birthday yesterday and we had made reservations over 2 weeks ago for 3 people.  We requested a specific table as it was a special occasion.  We were ensured that it would not be a problem.  We arrived for our 8pm reservation around 7:50pm.  

They had a hard time finding us in their system. Then here is the WORST part!  That table was NOT available!  The brilliant person who took the reservation failed to add it in the notes!  Lovely!  I was pissed to say the least and so was my boyfriend!  We didn't call 2 weeks ago to have to deal with this nonsense.

As they could tell I was pretty upset, they offered another table, obviously.  They also offered us to sit at the bar for drinks on the house while they set up another table.

We were seated within 10 minutes and our server took our drink orders.  The manager or owner came over and apologized for the mix up and even went so far as to get me a little potted plant that he brought to the table.

The Naan bread was also complimentary.  We ordered the chef's platter as an appetizer which is what we usually get and it was good for 3 people to share.

Our mains were:  Curry chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, and some yummy rice with peas and currants or something in it.  We had garlic naan on the side.

Service was very attentive and the food came out quickly.

All in all it turned out to be a nice Birthday dinner and we really enjoyed ourselves.

Here is what saved them:  They acknowledged their mistake, they offered drinks on the house, comped the Naan, gave us attentive service.  They made sure to make up for the issue with the reservations. 

If they hadn't made a gesture, we would have left and never gone back.  This place is our neighbourhood restaurant that we go to often.   I am happy to say that we will return again."}
{"text":"They serve the best Indian food I've had in Toronto. 2 couples shared lamb, butter chicken, veal madras and fish curry and we loved them all. The tandoori chicken app was awesome. The service was friendly, attentive and traditional. The wine is priced very well and the washroom is clean. We look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"This place seems to have a bit of a split personality. It looks like a pub, claims to be a wine bar and has a great indian food.

The food seems to be a North Amaericanized version of indian so there is a slight lack of authenticity to all the dished that they attempt to make up in presentation.
It sports a very large menu wish several hidden gems.
Overall probably the best Indian food in the area."}
{"text":"Went for summerliscious.  Very good Indian cuisine. Highly recommended. Good recommendations from staff."}
{"text":"I've been here several times in the past, though not recently. And while it was always decent, in my mind it was usually edged out by Amaya up the road. But I was walking past today, so I decided I'd give Kamasutra another try.  Unfortunately, I get the impression that they've replaced most of the traditional spices with salt. The person who took my order was sweet and helpful, so I can't complain about the service. But the food was really a disappointment. With the slightly better Amaya within walking distance, and the stellar Banjara just a short drive away, I don't think I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"I have lost count of the number of times I have eaten here. The complexity and depth of flavors are wonderful, the ambiance is warm, and the service is fairly good."}
{"text":"When you enter the restaurant it is beautifully set up and has a cozy feel but the food is a hit or miss depending on what you order.  I've only eaten here at lunchtime, I don't like the way they serve everything onto one plate. The samosas are limpy and  over stuffed. I liked  the butter chicken and the naan, also the eggplant is very good. The service is mediocre."}
{"text":"I am not normally a fan of Indian food, but Kamasutra is absolutely delicious. I order the Chicken Madras every time. It is loaded with flavour and packs a spicy punch. The portions are large, so unless you are a big eater, get ready for leftovers. 

It is a bit pricey, but it's totally worth it. I frequently elect to take out my food as I live around the corner, but the restaurant is very nice for eating in as well."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Kamasutra. We've been here on a couple of occasions and have always had a fantastic experience. The food is delicious, and its reasonably priced.
My bf is gluten/wheat intolerant so we are always looking fo places where there are gluten free options. On our first visit we asked the server what were our choices for a gluten free meal. He was very knowledgeable. He told us exactly what every item was made with and what was gluten free. I was impressed. Most of the time when I ask a server about their gluten free options they look at me all wide eyed and confused, clearly not knowing what I mean.

So we got an apetizer and I got butter chicken (my fave) and he got Chicken Byriani. The butter chicken was not the best I've had, but it was still delicious. The Byriani was superb. I also really love the warm naan with garlic and butter that they bring out while you wait for your food.

On our second visit we got the dinner for 2 which includes two meat or seafood dishes, one veg, the chef's appetizer platter, rice and naan.  We got the same server as the last time we were there, which was great :) This time we decided to try something new, so we had the chicken vindaloo, curry chana, and fish with some type of curry based sauce that I can't recall right now but was delicious.

All in all, the food was once again great, the service was fantastic (fast, attentive) and our server was super friendly and made little jokes with us and some small talk. Also, if you ask him what he recomends he will be more than willing to tell you and guide you. 
I love this place and I see it becoming my tried and true spot for when I want a nice and delicious Indian meal."}
{"text":"WOOHOO for Kamasutra I would eat there everyday if I could afford it! The food is amaazziinnnggg but expensive!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch. Not our first time. Great food and service. Mishkath, our server, was personable and knowledgeable. Great masala chai and lassi's."}
{"text":"Made a reservation at 7:30 for summerlicious and dipped into this spot last night by 7:15pm. The Hostess took us in politely.

The room was gorgeous, with dark reds and Indian pictures all over the walls. Not too big , just enough for it to be busy on a Tuesday evening. They also have a small patio outside, which gives it a casual feel.
Now I am much more of a lounge kind of girl, so right away I liked the feel of this place for dinner. Highly recommend for taking a date!

You can be a dressed down or up, with 2 or a group. They will accommodate accordingly. (we had a table of 9 beside us and right away I noticed the difference in service....(drink refills , bread coming out faster etc.). With us (2 people) ,food came out fast and we got privacy. They were always just close enough to notice we needed servicing. (although, this could be because we had a group close to us... )
Over all service from wait staff was really good. 
Only con, bartender didn't know how to make drinks. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!. That's after me getting it changed twice!. I had to settle for sprite!...ughh...
so for appetizers we had the fried coconut shrimp - delicious!!..breading was golden and shrimp was perfectly juicy.
for entree - I had the butter chicken and my girlfriend had the Lamb curry - WOW. The latter was soo tender.
Both dishes came with rice AND naan (the traditional bread)
Desert - I had the Carrot Halwa - came with vanilla ice cream. Sweet and would be pretty good with tea.
My girlfriend had the fruit/mango  custard. This wasn't so bad. Light and creamy with chunks of fruits and a blueberry on top. lol.
The Bill came up to $64.64 (excluding tip)
Besides drinks, I'd go back for dinner and try the regular menu. They had some interesting things I'd like to try out.

{"text":"If you are of Indian decent and know good Indian food, there is no way you will find the food at this restaurant appealing.  Came here on a Groupon deal about a month ago which is good because the regular prices at this restaurant are above average.

Let me start with the good: Very spacious, clean and a nicely decorated restaurant.  It is definitely a romantic atmosphere and great for couples and groups alike.  Also the naan bread and rice taste fine.

Now on to the main dishes: I'm not sure who is actually cooking the food in the kitchen, but I couldn't finish more than a few bites of my meal.  The reason I believe is because they add ingredients to certain dishes which have no business being in them.  For example I ordered the Mutter Paneer (Peas and Cheese) and Malai Kofta (Dumplings in a tomato sauce). These dishes are typically savory and spicy and the description of both on the menu would indicate such.  However, these dishes were served loaded with raisin's which made them sweet and unpalatable. I called the waiter over to ask why the dishes were so sweet and why there was raisins in the food to which he responded that it was normal and I should have asked to not have raisins.  This ingredient was not mentioned in the menu and I challenged him to find another Indian restaurant in the GTA where this ingredient is added to the dishes I ordered.  He offered to remake one of the dishes without raisins and it came back tasting burnt so I had one bite and could not eat any more.

I did not order any meat dishes, but any Indian restaurant should have mastery of vegetarian dishes at the very least.  I will never go back even if the meal was free."}
{"text":"We were going to head out to our fav for lunch at weston/st. clair  Ville Verde for Portuguese but construction is so over the top heading from east to west that we needed to think of where to get the heat of Piri Piri in the east end.  We decided on Indian, and since many of the resto on Gerrard are closed for lunch or offer buffet.  My designated Friday lunch gal from time to time decided the sit down lunch in Leaside/Davisville Village look good.  

No disappointing lunch offered.  The place was very sparse on patrons but the service was excellent.  It is white table cloth service for lunch and the menu offers $10-$12 portions of chef made indian.

The order:

Chicken Vindaloo $10.95
Aloo Gobi $10.95
Chicken Tikka Masala $10.95
3 orders of Tandori Naan (charged $2.25  xtra for one order)
Raita  $2.25
champange cocktail $10
one domestic beer $6

$73 (included tax and tip)

The vindaloo  was spicy like it should be but not over the top,  chunks of chicken w/basmati and a wonderful mango chutney & a veggie samosa.  The rice and chutney accompany all lunch specials.  Plus an order of naan.

The aloo gobi was not greasy sometimes you get that sitting in a bed of oil.  The Tikka was dry to the chicken but not dry in flavour.

The raita was a bit runny, but did the trick for the bite of Vindaloo.  

Perfect Indian lunch, we had a little more then we should but it was a girlfriend friday lunch with cocktail.  Quick lunch for 2 could easily be $15 each.

Only complaint, the server suggested that we didn't get the lunch aloo gobi because it included rice and such.  but we ordered more naan and if we got the lunch one that would have been included so we paid $2.25 more than we needed.  Not a big deal but worth noting.  Pictures uploaded of dishes.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for their Winterlicious and finished fairly dissatisfied. Good food, very poor service."}
{"text":"Not bad.  These guys have a fantastic atmosphere.  Definately worth taking a date.  Food.... So-so.  Not bad tho.  The manager seems to take keen interest in the place, quietly greets you, and is constantly near the kitchen.  They take great care, so they get a pass.  Listen, great atmosphere, take a date to impress.... Just not the greatest Indian food in Toronto.  You should go tho.  Worth a one time try and make up your mind for yourself :-)"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food, and service! Kamasutra just doesn't offer a full 5 star experience, but I can't say there is anything specific that makes it drop a star.  Kamasutra is a Bayview and Eg shining star. Although there are several reasons to head up there, the fact that more than a few blocks away you won't find any more independent restaurants is key.  
In my attempt at low-carb, low fat (yeah right at an Indian resto), I got the tandoori salmon.  My table mates got the tandoori chicken and a vegetable curry- spicy! The tandoori dinners are massive, fist-sized, lumps of protein coated in a light spiced yogurt marinade. The fish was unbelievably delicious and the chicken, I am told was equally good. The waiter was a joy and didn't interrupt our conversation and brought out a free garlic naan to share as we waited for our tandoori specialties.  
Drinks were decent, and they have a full bar, including decent wine selection.  The seats were super comfortable along the banquet with Indian silk-covered pillows. I loved this place and would happily return to see the waiters and eat the food next time I'm in the 'hood."}
{"text":"Went to Kamasutra this week. Been a few months since I've been there but i have to say that the food was amazing. The food tasted great. The chicken Vindaloo was spicy but incredible. Kept wanting to eat more and more. Never tried chicken quite like that before. If you're ever craving spicy chicken give this a go with some Naan bread. Simply fabulous.

Butter chicken was great too!!! So much better than last time. When i last went in May, i remember the food being on a bit of the dry side, but everything was fantastic this time. I had an opportunity to meet Raj, the new owner of Kamasutra. She is a really sweet lady and it was very nice of her to say hello. Absolute pleasure.


Thanks Raj and Kamasutra Staff,
Lovely meal 

Will"}
{"text":"Funny, I was just going there to pick up food, really. The server seemed to have an attitude, and when I presented my voucher for the food, his response to me was, \"your name's not on there, bro\".  Here's a tip: in a restaurant where you have tablecloth... don't call your customers \"bro\".  I found my name in 5 seconds, learn to read, bro.

I've been here a couple times before.  Food's solid, but after that experience, not sure if I want to go back."}
{"text":"The food was great and service as well. My only complaint is the prices. The prices seem to be jacked up simply because of the neighbourhood. We would order from here all the time if it was a bit cheaper!"}
{"text":"Big restaurant with nice decor. We enjoyed the fact that the table had some privacy yet it was part of a big room that was busy (although not nearly as busy as it should be on a Saturday night). Service was excellent - friendly and efficient. The food however was very heavy and gave us indigestion. We ordered two vegetarian dishes and a meat dish and all three came in a thick brown sauce that was unappetizing and made the dishes taste similar. Also, the servers walked by several times with sizzling platters for other customers that wafted an unpleasant burnt smell. This restaurant could be great, but they need to work on the food."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the past and the food has been hit or miss. I like that when you order your meal, you can choose what type of protein you'd like with each specific sauce. For instance, my best friend hates Lamb, but we both love the spicy Vindaloo sauce, so we order Beef or Veal Vindaloo and it's a nice change. The decor ie extremely dark and romantic-- like a sensual bedroom. So it's the sort of place I like to come to for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend. But that doesn't stop my BFF and I from ordering the Lover's Thali on occasion.

Their thali meals are great value. For either 2 or 4 persons you can choose from several meat and vegetarian dishes for a very reasonable price. The first time I was here, everything was excellent. Food, service etc. The second and third times the meat in all the curries was so dry I could have rubbed it between my palms and made sawdust. The sauces were great, but the meat should be tender as well. I actually had a hard time choking down the lamb (My boyfriend will eat Lamb). The last two times, they have not offered coffee or tea. I don't always want it, but if its offered as part of the menu, they should ask.

I might go back and give them another chance. I know they were selling groupons a while back and I think my friend bought one. So it might be worth another visit."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service. My family and I were treated royally by our waiter, Mishkat. Will definitely be back. Highly recommend the lamb saag."}
{"text":"Went fore the first time on March 25 2014. Loved it... went back a week later with a friend. Good, friendly, genuine service, but go LATE for dinner... its like a ghost town during the week, sadly, but peak hour friday (9pm) or saturday (8-9pm) for your reservation will make for a more interesting dinner. GREAT apps, and all the classics are in check. Unique Korma. con;'t eat it all, as the portions are huge, so even with one signature dish i took some home."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food and service when here. Mishkath has been our server the past few times and he's great. We always get dinner for two (the lover's combo or something like that). There's a lovers meal (dinner for two) that's great and leaves plenty for leftovers."}
{"text":"Often at times, one true indicator of how good a place is, is how busy they are on a Saturday night. If there's no one there, then you have to wonder what is wrong. We snagged a rather last minute 7pm reservation this past Saturday night and given the volume of people there, I'd say that we were lucky to do so.

For an appetizer, we ordered the tandoori sampler. It cost $17.95, and came with a few pieces of tandoori chicken (a bit on the spicy side), a few pieces of lamb, salmon and some cheese (I can't quite recall what it was called on the menu). For the most part, it was pretty tasty. By the way, this is a serving that is meant to be for two people.

For a main, we ordered the butter chicken and some lamb curry. For sides, we ordered one order of basmati rice and some naan. The mains range in price from $13 to $17/dish. The sides range from $2.50 to $5/dish. With tip and tax our bill ended up coming to $65. Note that we did not order any drinks, which would obviously inflated the bill.

As far as ambiance and service were concerned, the wait staff were very attentive and quite accommodating. The kitchen must have been humming because we received our food in quite a short order of time. As far as noise level was concerned, I would not consider Kamasutra as a place to have a quiet, intimate meal. I found the noise level to be quite high and would likely not suggest this place to take those of my parent's generation. That is, unless not having much of a discussion at the table is not a concern."}
{"text":"If your in laws are completely unadventurous but want to feel like they're having a cultural experience without really having a cultural experience, look no further.  This is Indian food toned down, whitened up and made expensive.  Goes well with the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Both the food and the staffs were pleasant. Great selection on drinks. Me and my wife both enjoyed our visit here. Next time we are visiting TDOT, we are definitely returning for more."}
{"text":"Kama Sutra is not your typical Indian restaurant. It's very modern and well designed with a long dark wooden bar that's comfy to enjoy a pre dinner drink. The menu has the classics: Korma, Tikka Masala, Vindaloo, and Butter Chicken. A good place for an upscale Indian dinner."}
{"text":"I live five minutes away from the restaurant and they can't seem to deliver in less than 80-90 minutes...fun times tonight with my last ever order, they arrived 2 HOURS after placing order then lied to me about when I placed order (ordered online and literally have the email)...sent them packing and didn't accept the delivery...called them at an hour and a half to cancel order so why guy came 2 hours late is beyond me."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try, and I can't say I was completely wowed. The ambience is romantic with dimmed lights, red paint and cushioned seats, and a quiet atmosphere. 

The complimentary warm garlic naan was appreciated. We ordered the chana masala, which was not very tasty or spicy. The chicken vindaloo's consistency was a little too thick for my liking, but still nice and spicy. The bastmati rice was delicious and not too oily. 

I didn't try the Malabar fish angoori, but was told that it was delicious and very flavourful. It is also one of the restaurant's signature dishes.
 
For dessert, we shared the gulab jamun, which tasted just right and not too sweet. The servers were a little reserved, but were still quite warm and the food was served quite quickly. I don't think the high prices are justifiable for the food served; therefore I would not return."}
{"text":"It has a romantic, classy-but-can-be-casual-also sort of ambiance. I've been twice, and both times is has been mostly empty, so it's always a wonderfully low noise level. 

As for the food: It's not the best, but it's at least average, and sometimes perhaps even a dash beyond that. The prices are above average, however, so it's not the place to go if you'd care more about saving some money than you would about ambiance, for example. As for our group, it was a great place to be able to talk, and leisurely enjoy some above-average Indian food.

The butter chicken was moist, but overpowered by the sauce, which tasted a lot like plain tomato sauce. It was not seasoned enough. 

There was no vegetarian korma on the menu, but they whipped one up for us. That was much more seasoned, with some spice to it, and was yummy. But they didn't cut the broccoli pieces up enough, and it could've used some more vegetables in it. 

All in all it's a fine place to experience, especially for a special occasion, but it's not a place I would regularly visit. It is sentimental to me and I love good Indian food, so I'll probably end up going here again some time."}
{"text":"I'm not one to just give out one star... i like to give places benefit of the doubt, but after our experience at Kamasutra a couple days ago, I've changed my mind. 

first thing you need to know: although they claim to be gluten-free friendly, THEY ARE NOT GLUTEN-FREE FRIENDLY AT ALL. my mom got so sick from eating their \"gluten free\" food... and then they have the audacity to tell my mom that maybe she's allergic to spinach because there was no gluten in the food. Really?! What kind of customer service is that?! 

Not only that, but the server was horrible - rolling his eyes when we ordered and stressed the importance of making sure everything was gluten free (although, that should of been the first sign that he just didn't care). 

I used to frequent this place and never have any complaints - but i can honestly say that I will NEVER go back - and i will make sure to tell everyone I know NOT to go."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious for a $23 prefix menu. I had the onion bahji as the app and lamb curry for main, apple strudel with icecream as the dessert.

The app was pretty tasty, fresh and had 4 pieces. The lamb curry was pretty flavourful too and it came with white rice, Nan and a bit of salad. The only problem was the rice, it was flavourless and bland. But the Nan was fresh and hot. Overall the food is decent so I give it 3 stars. 

However, the service was very slow on a Saturday afternoon and it's not busy at all -- thats why it's a 2 star review. I would give it 2.5 if yelp allowed for half stars"}
{"text":"I visited the Kamasutra restaurant with my friend Chris C (please see his review on this restaurant)
We were greeted by Danielle the waitress and shown to our seat in the relaxing ambiance of India.
Onion Bhaji (battered onions with Indian herbs and spices)
Tasted like perfectly pickled onions without the sour taste.  I could've eaten this all day.  The tamarind sauce added another tantalizing hit to the palate.  Awesome!
Tandoori Lamb Tikka (Boneless lamb seasoned in cumin, coriander and black pepper and finished in the tandoor)
The tender pieces were perfectly cooked and served with a citrus mix with leaf, tomato and cucumber.  The lemon tasted like it was pickled with a dash of salt...perfect!  I found out later from the manager that it was sprinkled with chalt Masala.  Delicious!
Lamb Vindaloo (Goan style pickle lamb curry in hot and sour Goan spices)
Butter Chicken 
Disclaimer: my favorite food is Pakistani food.  With that said the Kamasutra is a North Indian restaurant.  So I am not attempting to compare the two types of cooking.
I did enjoy the sauce and the lamb but found it a slight gamy for my palate.  However, my friend Chris C, an Elite Yelp member did not share my report, he found the dish just right.
We both found that the Butter Chicken lacked more cream hence the tomato taste was more pronounced.
Chicken Biryani
I could taste every subtle flavor and spice..incredible, nothing overpowers, just a perfect blend.
Malai Kofta (cottage cheese balls in a creamy cashew nut sauce)
I was overjoyed when the sweetness hit the back of my throat.
After speaking with the manager we were pleased that he took our critique with concern and promised to do much better even though I believe the dishes were all just delicious.  He is also continuing to change or add to the decor so that one will double take when stepping into the restaurant and wonder, is this India? Wow!
The food overall was mouthwatering and delicious more so than many top Indian Restaurants in Greater Toronto.  Chris C and I enjoyed the food.  The waitress, Ms. Danielle's service, smile and conversation made for a much more pleasant dining experience.  A stark contrast to the more serious demeanour of the manager.
We will return."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty. Service was a little slow though. Took them a long time to get our bill and clear the table. The levels of spiciness wasn't very high even for 3 chili's (highest was 4) so ask them to kick it up a notch if you like spice. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent experience here, will definitely go back. Had a beautiful dinner with my beautiful gf :)
Our waiter was very good, and super helpful guiding us through our first time at Kamasutra.
We ended up going with a mixed sampler platter and I can't really think of one thing we didn't like. The various curries were all uniquely satisfying. Nothing was really too hot.
Great naan and basmati rice! Took home our leftovers and devoured that the next day ;)

Would give a 4.5 if I could. Service is 5 stars easily."}
{"text":"great food, wasn't crazy about the service, it was on the stand offish side, but food sorta made up for it!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 1:30 during winterlicious on a Saturday, only had a few tables filled. Ambience is great, great for date nights, well ventilated. Food is ok, basic Indian food, nothing mind blowing or memorable. Rice was bland, they could've mixed in some herbs or oil in it to make it better... naan was served hot, but was served when we were almost finished our main. Service is subpar, very very very slow. Waited almost 45 minutes for food to come and every dish had us waiting. Luckily the food was hot when it was served. 

Overall: ok for a date night, if you are not hurried at all and want to wait a long time for ok food. Price range is ok ($23 winterlicious lunch) for what we got. There are better Indian food options out there"}
{"text":"Not a good experience at all - I've gone to better places.
We have a deal 25 for 50, went in and ordered stuff for 50 something dollars. Our server was an older girl/woman with a huge attitude. (Like, come on, I'm a bartender and a have worked as a server before. The friendlier you are, the chances are you get better tips to make up for your bad wages.)   She kept ignoring us, and even when we were asking for something else, we had to wave to get her attention, because she was acting as if we wouldn't need anything. 
Later on, we found out the reason why she was being a b**** to us. The bill she brought us had $11.50 extra for a yogurt and something else on it, while it should have been only a few bucks. On top of that, there was a charge of $10.16, and she said, \"So as you should have noticed, the coupon says gratuities will be added, and here is your bill.\" It was $23.50 extra!!! So it worked out to be almost $50 that was the \"original\" price for the deal anyway! 
She was rude about the gratuity when we asked her, and wasn't willing to explain how it works. I personally wouldn't tip a rude server that ruins my dining experience $10.16 by force.   
We got the manager after a long wait, and he was like, \"Oh yeah, the gratuities are 18%, but if you're unhappy with the charges, I'll get you a refund\". He finally came back with a $10 bill (that was less than the gratuity amount, never mind the extra food charges) and said, \"Have a good night and bye\". 
Honestly, if we knew there was gonna be close to 20% gratuities, etc., we wouldn't have bought the deal. I've gone to way better Indian restaurants.  The reason why I'm not giving this a 1 star is because he refunded us some of our money.
I'll never go back."}
{"text":"In 10 words or less: overpriced, bland, pretentious, poorly spiced, and indifferent service. I can't imagine how the place stays in business with Amaya and Amaya Express just up the street."}
{"text":"This place is out local favorite.  We came here first almost 13 years ago. The night before my daughter was born and be have been back many times since.  It is by far my favorite Indian restaurant and I've been lucky enough to have traveled to India.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and if you get Mashkat as your survey. He is great!"}
{"text":"Kamasutra is a complete disaster of a restaurant and probably couldn't exist outside of the stuffy bubble of Leaside. There is a hell of a lot going on that makes me cringe and here are the highlights:

1. The wait staff are pretentious.
2. They serve humous with their papadum. 
3. The serve Pepsi products.
4. The Biryani was mushy and tasteless.
5. The chicken tikka masala was basically sauceless and had massive chunks of chicken. The sauce itself had slight hints of flavor but for the most part it felt like I was eating a boiled chicken breast.
6. The chicken Boona was revolting."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try this place for their Winterlicious special, and we loved it. 
I have always wanted to try this place and this was a chance we both jumped on. The staff was very friendly and very attentive. They made sure we had enough naan or rice at all times. 
I had the paneer pakora, which were done very well, and the lamb curry which was very flavourful. My friend had the chicken and a paneer dish, which were equally very flavourful. It was not overwhelming with too many spices but just the right amount. For dessert, I had the rasmalai and she had the kulfi which were delicious."}
{"text":"First went here and had the winterlicious menu (which was the only option , no a-la-cart...but no big deal. the menu had lots of options)
The karela chicken was excellent. 
The butter chicken was good.  Standard butter chicken.  Can't go wrong. And So was the Na'an.  
Dessert i did not care for, but that probably was because of my tastes..no fault of the restaurant.
But from my experience when a waiter notices you haven't touched what you ordered ....they ask why...but hey service is what brought my review down .

Now i was going between 2 star and 3 star.  Why?  well the food was good, but the service was horrible.  An hour after being seated we our main course was not served yet.  In addition no one asked if we wanted another round of drinks.  (the water atleast was filled often)  But waiting an hour for food, I understand mistakes happen, but atleast check up on us.  The waiter did around an hour come up and finally and say he doesn't know what was the hold up.

A couple who came in after us actually had there food, there desert, and paid the bill by time we got our main chicken.  And i am sorry...there is no reason why indian food takes an hour to come out.  
OR why a waiter doesn't check on his table....
Eventually when he did come up to us an hour after being seated to say he is checking on our order, he did offer to comp us a a drink.  So we did get another round after finishing our other drinks for a half hour, and no main course.  But a free drink isn't a big deal.  


I stuck at 2 star just because of the service.  The food was good, (the appetizer was above average for sure) but butter chicken is butter chicken.  Same as you would get at a local indian restaurant."}
{"text":"The food quality has declined, not enough spices anymore. I guess it is adapting to neighbours tastes."}
{"text":"I came across a deal that I couldn't resist so my sidekick, Raj, and I went out looking for Kamasutra. It's an Indian restaurant on Bayview, south of Eglinton, with a Green P lot conveniently located across the street.

Once inside, we were greeted by a very cheery young lady, Danielle. The decor was very nice and upscale. We asked about the special that I had come across but the manager said it was only available Monday through Thursday, even though it wasn't dated. Anyway, we managed to get past that and the manager ended up taking care of us through most of our visit.

We ordered from a four course menu that had lots of choices. We started with the Onion Bhaji and Tandoori Lamb Tikka. Both dishes were delicious, packed with flavour. The onion bhaji was crispy and was served with a tamarind sauce and pickled onions. The lamb was served off the skewer with a mint sauce, some veggies, and more of those yummy pickled onions. Wow, a great way to start our meal!

The remaining dishes arrived all at once, each in its own bowl, making it very easy to share. It all looked delicious but the camera had to eat first. See photos.

The Lamb Vindaloo is a curry stew with potatoes and spices. It was very good but Raj thought it tasted a little gamey. I loved it.

The Kamasutra Butter Chicken had a lot of rich tomato sauce, maybe a tad more tomato than I'm used to in butter chicken but it did taste very good. The chicken was moist and had a good depth of flavour. This may be one of the top three butter chicken dishes I've enjoyed.

Palak Paneer (spinach and cheese) may not be a very attractive dish but this version tasted very good. Again, maybe another top three.

We tried the Malai Kofta, a dish I've never seen before. It's a cottage cheese ball in a creamy cashew nut sauce. Interesting, in a very good way. I would order this again.

Rounding out our meal was a Chicken Biryani, Pulao Rice, regular naan, and garlic naan. The pulao rice had a little saffron, peas, and cumin. The naan was hot and crispy and the garlic naan was delicious. I love garlic. The chicken biryani was colourful and had a generous amount of moist chicken. This might be the best one I've had.

We also tried Cheetah Indian beer. It's a lager that we both found was a little sweeter than the Kingfisher we tried recently. It was good.

Overall, I have to say this is the best Indian restaurant I've been to. The food was excellent. The service turned out to be be really good, especially from Danielle, who checked in with us frequently.

Now that I've discovered Kamasutra, I can't wait to come again. ;)"}
{"text":"We went there for Valentine's Day and it SUCKED!

When we walked in for our 9 o'clock reservation we had to wait 15 minutes as apparently \"Everyone came in late because of the weather\", yes, light drizzle is indeed the kind of weather that makes people come in late. We and 5 more couples were standing in the small doorway waiting until we'll be seated.

Once we were seated we had to wait another 10 minutes for a server to come to our table and ask us for drinks and water. So, in total 25 minutes of waiting, with additional 5 mins until we actually got water. At that point I was boiling with rage and wanted to leave but my bf insisted on staying. 

Then the waiter came by for our food orders, while taking our food order he got distracted and started talking to the people seated at the table beside us. It looked like he was flirting with the guy at the other table. Now, my boyfriend was pissed off too 'cause he was starving. Wouldn't you be after 30 minutes of waiting just to get your water?

While we were eating our food, twice they brought food which we didn't order. Once it was double order of drinks, second time it was the dessert.

So, the overall impression? Highly disappointing. $70/person + drinks + taxes is not worth it!

Would I ever go to this place agagin or recommend it to friends? Nope."}
{"text":"Excellent modern Indian restaurant!  Food was spicy like real Indian food.  Presentation and plating what made me give it 5 stars.  Meats definitely tasted like it was pre-marinated days before.  Kabobs were spot on.  I wouldn't consider it expensive bc it's located on bay view.  Bar is great when waiting for table."}
{"text":"Had a very good gourmet indian feast. The decor is more like an upscale pub with a huge bar and loft high ceilings.  the service was very prompt which is highly unusual for Indian restaurants where I expect slow.   The food was very good- from the Tika Masala to the Tandorri- I also really enjoyed a grilled lamb and Veal Sag- the chefs appetizer plate was just fair and one mystery patty I would not recommend atall- I could not figure out what it was- one of the nice things about this restaurant is that the ingredients were all fresh and I could taste it.  Portions were not small.  Rice Pudding was also excellent.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"We ate here due to a Grupon coupon that we purchased, as it is a bit far from out West End home.  But we will certainly come back.

The large room is comfortable and accommodating, with indented black upper walls to cleverly give the impression of empty space behind them and elegant chandeliers.  The food is North Indian with a modern/fusion trend.  Everything was first rate - our appetizers of topnotch samosa and fried coconut crusted calamari with a great chutney along with terrific chicken madras and spicy lamb - the latter was exceptionally tender.

Service was friendly and helpful as well.

Given its name there had to be something erotic in the place somewhere, so the poster of sexually suggestive temple carvings in the men's room filled the bill, I guess.

Look forward to additional visits."}
{"text":"Still one of my fave places to order from. The kashmiri naan is sooo good!"}
{"text":"Food and service were both descent but certainly didn't blow me away.  I wouldn't go out of my way to dine there but if I were in the area I would go again."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner here when my inlaws got home from the cottage. Their anniversary is coming up, my mother's birthday is coming up, and my husband and I both just had birthdays. And the dining room at home is full of our moving boxes. So we decided to go out.

There were five of us. The grownups drank wine while my husband and I drank beer. Pints on tap are under $7 for imported stuff. Wine starts at $20 for a half litre carafe, which fills about three glasses and a bit. There were a few different house reds and they settled on a Malbec which turned out to be very nice.

On the back of the menu I discovered the group dinner deal -- dinner for four for $89.95. What they call dinner for four involves pappadums and three other set appetizers, our choice of three meat dishes and two veggie dishes, naan and rice, and coffee and tea. We asked the waitress if the five of us could get by on the dinner for four or if we should order more, and she said we'd be fine with the dinner for four as it stands. (The service was great, quick and friendly, and the waitress and I had a rather geeky conversation about beer. Note to self: seek out beer from Double Trouble Brewing.) So here's what we got. All the entrees came in bowls to share.

Bharta (smoked eggplant) studded with bright green peas, very smokey and spicier than I'm used to. Tasty but overwhelmingly flavoured, which is odd for bharta. A bit of a chore to finish.

Chicken tikka masala: bright red, spicy and intense. Big chunks of onion. Really lovely.

Goanese fish and prawns: blew me away. Tingly coconut gravy on big pieces of buttery white fish. Of all the fish I've tried since I started eating meat again, this has got to be the best. Too bad there isn't more of it. I didn't get any of the shrimp but I didn't care.

Lamb in shakuti sauce: mild, creamy coconut sauce and bits of lamb that are very tender and not greasy.

Aloo gobhi masala: just what it says on the tin, spiced potatoes and cauliflower. I'm not a big fan, but then again I've never had a bad aloo gobhi. 

I have to specifically mention the tea, for which I chose masala chai. I was slightly saddened that I didn't have room for dessert (the 'dinner for four' was enough to make three seniors and two thirtysomethings walk very slowly afterwards and collapse in food comas at home) but the tea fixed that. It came with the cream added -- or was it condensed milk? -- and tasted like I was drinking a bowl of gulab jamun. You know how in 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' there's gum that makes you think you're eating a meal while you're chewing gum? It was like that.

Overall: the food was intense and luxurious, a sensory experience worthy of being named after that chapter of the Kama Sutra that we in the West obsess about. That said, it probably won't be hot enough for folks who know what real Indian food is like. (This pepperhead white girl was quite pleasantly hopped up on endorphins by the end of dinner.) The decor is comfortably dark and velvety without being uncomfortably pretentious. Can it be? -- there's no step up to get inside, and even the washrooms are on the main floor. This is a classy place with great food, and you can have a luxurious dinner while dressing casually and not spending as much as you'd think. I've had takeout from them before and it didn't prepare me for the experience of eating there. Thumbs up all around. 

Note: it was a Thursday after 7 pm and the place was deserted. We were still asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't. I suspect huge crowds on Friday nights."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a Groupon deal ($25 for $50!), and left utterly impressed with their food!

Their chicken tandoori was to die for. Their chana masala and aloo gobi were also pretty good. Their menu items are priced slightly higher than most Indian restaurants; I feel that it's justified with their classy and intimate setting, and their superb food quality. Our server was very attentive...it would have been a 5 star experience if she was a tad bit friendlier."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  Reservations at 7:30.
I think they must of had an off night because the service was really slow, unless that is how they roll.

It took some times for drinks to come and then for our server to come back and take our orders.  The servers do know their stuff and know exactly what is good and what to pair it with.  Spicyness is an issue at my table so she explained what would be good for each person. 

Once the orders were taken the food took quite awhile to come to us.
I think we sat there for a good half hour waiting.   Thank goodness we had good conversation.

Once the food came it did NOT disappoint!
Most of my table had the butter chicken - delish!  A little spicy but not enough to burn your mouth off. 
I could have used a little more chicken - most of my 5 pieces were drowned in sauce.. they should give you a little more when you're having dinner.

The restaurant itself was lovely... very nice layout and has a romantic feel to it if you were on a date.
Like previous yelpers have said, you can dress up or dress down.. it's fits both styles. 

I would definetely come here again - I just hope next time it's a little more quiciker.

To give you an idea .. reservations were at 7:30 and I didn't get out until 10 and that was just main course - no dessert of appetizers.
Positive thing out of it is that you aren't rushed right??"}
{"text":"This was our second time ordering take-out from this restaurant.  The first time, we were quite impressed with the amount and flavour of the food - a little costly but tasty.

When our Indian appetite hit us last night, we ordered again.  Our order consisted of the Chef's Appetizer Platter which was supposed to consist of Chicken pakoras, Brie pakoras, samosa & papadums served with mint and tamarind chutney - cost was 13.95.  The quality and taste of the food was not even worth $5.00 - nothing to do with the fact it was take-out - the flavours (and quantity of food for that price) just weren't there.
The balance of the meal consisted of Chicken Korma - where's the chicken??  Honestly for the price of $15.95, I would expect more than 6 pieces of chicken which is barely enough for two people, never mind the 3 people we thought this take out order should have fed.
Aloo Gobhi Masala - $12.95 - more than enough of this vegetarian dish but lacking in flavour.
Garlic Naan and Saffron Rice and oh, yes...3 CANS OF POP cost over $8.00!!!!!!!!!
Total cost:  $85.00 plus.

We felt completely ripped off in cost, flavour and quantity of food with this order.  Unless things change drastically, we will not be placing any further orders with this restaurant.  Our Toronto perimeter has too many other Indian restaurant options to put up with this crap."}
{"text":"Amazing warm service. The best service I've honestly ever had in any restaurant in this city. Vinayak, the manager greets everyone with a warm smile as do all the staff. They don't treat you with the normal polite courtesy expected but with genuine human warmth. 

The food is exceptional. The mocktails and the cocktails are very tasty. The appetizers are creative including a baked Brie with an Indian twist. My dining partner and I had paneer makhni, paneer tikka and malai kofta and they were very tasty. Highly highly recommended. A jewel of a
Restaurant in the Bayview Eglinton area."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by for Indian food. If you have a flyer, keep it handy for the coupon during specific times.

We had the dinner for two, with butter chicken, palak paneer and jalfrezi (custom order). Also included was a chef's appetizer plate as well as rice and na'an. I also ordered yoghurt, but unfortunately it never came but at least I was never charged. I would've preferred it if they introduced the food when it arrived at the table, especially for the chef's appetizer plate. Otherwise, service was good as expected. A lot of attention was paid to the decor here and the restaurant is very large and roomy.

The butter chicken and palak paneer were my favourites. The palak paneer was thick and had large chunks of paneer. The butter chicken was sweet and creamy and both went well with the na'an. The jalfrezi was okay, but wasn't as satisfying as the other two dishes.

I would definitely come back again.

{"text":"True Indian cuisine, inventive and flavorful. The grilled calamari curry was to die for, and I swear those spices are aphrodisiacs. Perfect service, lovely menu. Skip Amaya down the street (attitude and pricy) and head for Kama Sutra."}
{"text":"Made a reservation over a month ago for 17 people. 1 week before the event we doublechecked the reservation to make sure everything was ready and they backed out of hosting the event and tried to charge us an extra $200 just for service. We ended up choosing a backup location for the event. Very unhappy with their poor communication skills."}
{"text":"Horrible place, overcooked greasy food and under par slow service. We asked what Mixed Veg includes, the white boy server had no clue. We asked for a certain type of bread, he forgot. We waited another 10mts before starting to eat after all dishes were placed. Not worth the price or time!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best northern (mostly) Indian food in Toronto. Inside atmosphere is elegant, but doesn't try to compete with the nouveau decor of the latest crop of top restaurants downtown. The patio is basic, but provides a great alternative for dinning outdoors on warm nights. Portions are generous, so if you want to taste many different dishes, best to go with a larger group, or be prepared for leftovers. The menu has all of the more known dishes, so you will likely find your favorites. The service is professional and courteous. The staff is knowledgeable about the various options and can help guide you, if you are unfamiliar with Indian food. Has a full bar with a well considered wine list that can withstand typical Indian spices. Not expensive, but also not bargain basement. You will feel the dinner is appropriately priced.. Located in Leaside on the Bayview strip which is filled with patios, so there are after dinner alternatives like gelato for desert or a drink at a local watering hole."}
{"text":"Not sure why it's named after a sex book but me and my friend decided to come here for Summerlicious. Both the service and food was exceptional. My friend said it's the best butter chicken she's had at any restaurant and I agree that it was indeed delicious! We were asked if we'd like more naan bread when he saw us gobble it all down. The naan bread is also free. One complaint is that the dessert portion is small, I was expecting two Gulab Jamuns but only got one. Our waiter didn't tell us his name but he was very friendly and attentive. I decided to order alcohol and I typically get ID'ed because I look young and he jokingly asked if he should check for ID. By the end of service, he suggested we try to guess each other's age. One of the best waiters I've come across."}
{"text":"Kamasutra has a lovely atmosphere, good food, and a very attentive staff. They have a pretty good selection of wine as well. I would pick this place over the Amaya any day."}
{"text":"Our family thought they would try something new and went to Kamasutra for Christmas Day Lupper.  We ordered the family dinner for 4 which came with an appetizer platter, 5 dishes (we did three veg and two meat), rice and naan.  It was perfect for our family and allowed us to have leftovers!  The server was amazing and had a great sense of humour.  My father walks with canes and when the staff just mopped the hallway tiles, a server came and assisted him back to our seats - top notch in our books, will definitely be going back!  Also, best palaak paneer I have EVER had!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and exceptional service, we went for dinner and really felt looked after. The sharing platters are great options for the price conscious. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I'm quite an expert on Indian food having lived in India for most of my life and being a foodie since I turned 5 (rather that's my earliest memory of liking delicious things).

So I went enthusiastically to try this place. A bit snotty - quite empty but they made a show of giving us a table at 5 pm without reservations. The complimentary garlic naan is appreciated and is a nice touch as someone else mentioned.

The Delhi style chili chicken was tasty, but the lamb karhai style was just ok. They lacked spice punch entirely, despite 3 chilli signs next to these items. Not suited to an Indian palette at all, and not for you if you're looking for authenticity. But the chili chicken was creative for sure - something I look for in a contemporary high end restaurant. Indian mains served with naan have to have more curry/gravy - that's how we Indians like to dip our naans and rotis. But these were a lot more dry and not fun with naan or roti.

Expensive for what it was, but fine dining Indian style for sure. However, it lacked the little touches that Indian food presents culturally - fennel seeds in creative sugary casings to clear the palette.

I'm not coming back unless I just want ambience."}
{"text":"$25 for Summerlicious experience at Kamasutra is really a great deal and I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, the service and the food. 

Great selections of Main! Yes there are 7 to choose from and your vegetarian friends would be happy with the selections! 

Appetizer: 
Pomegranate Chaat 
- love the complex taste and texture, I was half full after eating that! 
Kerala Crispy Shrimps 
- tasted pretty bland and the description is a lot more taster! 

Main: (love the naan bread on the side!!) 
Chicken Hot Pot Sizzler 
- Chicken breast was surprising tender, the sauce has great flavours and love how it comes out sizzling hot!! 
Lamb Shank Curry 
- Curry sauce was really mild but the lamb was really tender 

Dessert: 
Ras Malai 
- My dinner mate making faces when I asked him to try that... texture is strange.. I did enjoy the sweet milk syrup.. but I will pass! 
Coconut Caramel Pie 
- great if you have a sweet tooth... but sickening sweet!! 

Services was top notch! Great deco and with the dim lighting make Kamastura a great date place!! I might have to invite my Hot Yoga Date next time, she would love it here!!"}
{"text":"My family visits Kama Sutra often because the food is consistent and the prices are reasonable. During the week you'll have no trouble getting a table, on the weekends during peak times a reservation is a good idea. We tend to order the same thing every time which consists of 4 dishes where you choose the meat and the sauce plus we'll order maybe the lentil dish or an appetizer. On our most recent visit our server wasn't very friendly and didn't seem to know a lot about the food. The people who brought out our food and re-filled our water were nicer and more enthusiastic about the service. The place is very nicely decorated and I like the dim lighting. The fabric on the benches is a little bit worn in some parts but the cushions make it comfy and cosy. They have a patio so patrons can sit outside in the nice weather. They don't have a parking lot so you'll have to try your luck on the street; there is metered parking on both sides of Bayview Ave. and there are also some free spots a little further south on Bayview Ave that you might be able to nab if you go early. I will be returning to Kama Sutra for years to come!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for winterlicious and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant has nice decoration like a high tend pub. It is bright, spacious and has very comfortable sitting area. The food was awesome, a little bit spicier include butter chicken which usually not spicy at all in other Indian restaurants. The homemade mango ice cream was made with real mango and ver tasty. I think it's the best Indian restaurant in town. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"What happened?   I've been coming here on and off for years and always loved the food here, in particular the  Prawns Pakora.  Where I  came here in the spring, I was not disappointed.  I came again last week and did not see the Prawns Pakora on the menu any more.  Instead they had some new and different items like Brie Pakora which seems like an odd addition.  Our server was lovely and very attentive, and when I asked about the Prawns Pakora, she said they had them despite the fact that it was nowhere to be found on the menu.  We ordered them along with some other items.  Unfortunately, something has changed dramatically:  they were nothing like they used to be.  The butter chicken was also disappointing in that the sauce was pretty sweet and tomato-ey.
Overall, I felt like the food had lost its authenticity and I'm wondering why that is.  Not sure if I want to come back any more and am heartbroken that one of my favourite Indian restaurants has descended to such levels."}
{"text":"This is where my Indian friends go when they aren't in their own neighbourhood.

Great Indian dining with a the best service I have received in a while.  The manager does everything he can to make sure you're happy and the staff's attention to detail ensure that everyone is having a good time.  E.g. at the end of the night some of our guest liked certain mints that came with the bill better than others.  The server noticed and brought out the favourite mints."}
{"text":"I went there two weeks ago with another couple who really like Indian food.  I had made reservations there as I had eaten there a few years ago and the food had been quite good.  Our most recent was a huge disappointment.  They now serve Canadianized Indian food that is extremely poorly executed.   We ordered Onion Bahjis for example and what we received was something that looked like Harvey's onion rings.  We had a veal vindaloo that I am sure was diced precooked square cubes of veal that had been the last minute tossed in a very odd spicy bbq sauce.  It was clear that none of the meat had been cooked in any of the sauces cuz the butter chicken was the same.  Blocks of boneless chicken tossed in the sauce in the last minute and served to the table - none of the lovely flavours that absorb when you actually cook the meat in a delicious sauce.  Not only was the meal bad overall, the meal was actually quite expensive.  My husband actually woke up two days after we went to the restaurant and said I can't believe how bad the food at  Kamasutra was - I still can't get over it.  I would never go back - there are way too many good restaurants in Toronto."}
