{"text":"Sooo good.  Breakfast is amazing, yummy granola, tasty omelettes and such good multigrain bread.  
They are awesome at refilling your coffee too.
It looks very small from the outside, but there is tons of room at the back."}
{"text":"Brad's take-out eatery is a really cute brunch spot - i would say its on the pricier side for brunch but worth it b/c everything comes with fancy ingredients 

According to Michelle A., I always get the omelet with roasted chicken, cheddar and avocado - I don't think it's b/c it's so good i want it every time, but more b/c i go here rarely and forget what I got the last time and i usually like anything with avocado 

The last time i saw someone eating the french toast with fruit and was jealous - i hope to remember to try that next time 

Two downsides to Brad's: (1) Service is slow; (2) it is extremely hot inside in the summer -- if you're not in a hurry and didn't power walk there on a hot day you should be fine."}
{"text":"Brad's is my favourite brunch spot on Roncesvalles. It's usually packed on weekends, so service can be a bit slow, but the food is delicious. I've had a few items (yogurt and granola, eggs benny, brioche french toast with carmelized bananas) but my favourite is the vegetarian omelet -it's packed full of portobello mushroom, rapini, roasted tomatoes and goat cheese. My sister loves the roasted chicken, cheddar and avocado omelet. Both come with  toast, potatoes (spicy) or salad."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and food was delicious!

I had a baked cheese crepe dish, and my boyfriend had Mac and Cheese. I loved the Mac and Cheese! mmmmm! The crepe was good on it's own merit too. Everything was broiled to perfection for that extra cheese crispiness on the top.

Both dishes came with either fries or salad so we got one of each.  Fries were deliciously seasoned and crisp. Salad was good too.

Would definitely go again and again!"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I decided to go over to Brad's Takeout and try brunch with two friends.

The good:

1. The place was clean and we got a seat by the window.
2. The menu was large
3. Service was quick.

The Bad:

1. Coffee was 2.75?!
2. All three of us thought the breakfast fell flat - we had the chicken avocado omelet, the portabella omelet and the breakfast croissant.
3. The homefries were tasteless, but then they also had an odd after-taste that was not appetizing.
4. the omelets were \"dry\"
5. The breakfast croissant was stale and the pemeal bacon had an odd taste to it.  I assume its the oil they used to fry it.

Conclusion:

We'd never come back."}
{"text":"Been to Brad's twice. Both brunches.

Food is OK. It's maybe SLIGHTLY over priced for what you get. I've had a chicken/avocado omelette  and BBQ brisket with eggs.

It takes so fucking long sometimes here. Last weekend I dropped by. 5 min to get menu. +8min to get water. 35+min to bring out two omelettes. 7.4+min to bring over bill when we asked for it. 

We were there for like an hour and were eating for about....10 minutes. No one checked on our meals, and when I asked about when it would be out the guy didn't even stop in his walk towards the kiddie table beside us and said shouldn't be long. 10+ min more. Friggin' guy.

SO many little kids and babies in this place. Not great if you've got a hangover and want to eat ASAP / do not want to listen to screaming. Actually, that's not great even if you don't have a hangover."}
{"text":"Just had brunch at Brad's and the thing that impressed me the most is the space.  It's full of natural light and the kind of place that I would love to come in the winter, just to get a shot of sunshine while still staying warm.  Other reviews have said it can get very hot  but today was pre-rain cool outside. so the cafe was perfect.

I have no complaints about Brads, but wasn't blown away by the food, either.  They have a large brunch menu that includes lots of different sweet and savoury items.  We all went for savoury and nothing disappointed.  The veggie omelet with rapini, tomatoes and chevre was tasty.  Eggs benedict with smoked salmon was reportedly delicious, as were the sausages (according to my friend).  The savoury crepe (with cheese and veggies) was also quite good, although I wish they hadn't served the side salad on the same place as a hot crepe dish that they just took out of the oven.  It made the salad greens hot and wilted.  Also, my husband remarked that he would have loved a slightly larger portion.

Service was perfectly good and the wait for coffee and food was standard.  The server checked in with us and brought around coffee twice.  

I would highly recommend Brad's as a place to go when you are craving sunlight and a warm, slow-paced meal.  

Vegetarian score: 7.5/10.  Slightly better than average brunch offerings for non-meat eaters."}
{"text":"Had brunch on a Saturday. Overall I was really happy with the choice and will return again. Service was great and not slow at all. Prices are not, as indicated too high. I was perhaps expecting more. It's around 10-12 for your benedict or whatever. The kids selections are well thought out and the pancakes come with a cup of chocolate chips. Epic win in my girls' book. The room itself is nice & sunny and they have an old garage/atrium at the back that's cool. The food itself is average or a bit above. The home fries are great."}
{"text":"Another tough one on Roncy to really qualify!  These guys have some of the very, very best french fries I've ever eaten (Yukon gold, fry-truck-style, with fleur de sel, fine ground pepper, and smoked paprika) -- so simple yet so delicious!

On the strength of those fries, I'd be tempted to say 5 star... seriously, they're that good (the server, who may have been Brad, said he always recommends them over the side salad).  I suspect they're not as good takeaway -- fries don't do well in containers -- so eat in or don't blame me.

The sandwich I had with them was somewhere between \"meh\" and \"a-ok\", partially due to my surprise at learning it was chilled despite containing *grilled* eggplant and *roasted* red pepper.  I expected a warm, panini-like sammy (on a cold, rainy day), and got a chilled one.  Bummer.  2.5 star, but not a deal breaker by any stretch, and those fries are good enough to forgive greater tragedies than a temperature miscalculation!  Besides, maybe I should have asked...

The space is small but well laid out, its atmosphere relaxed and welcoming; I'm told it can get VERY hot in the summer, but that heat retention played as a strength on a chilly day in late October.  All in all a lovely little place to have a sit down lunch.

I'll definitely be back, and I look forward to trying other menu items -- with a side of fries, naturally!"}
{"text":"Love Brad's for a quick weekend breakfast with my wife before heading out to High Park. Coffee is decent if somewhat unspectacular, but the food is outstanding. 

Superb brisket, wonderful poached eggs, fantastic homemade chili sauce. Sit at the back, it's nicer and airier than the front."}
{"text":"Just back from a nice brunch at brad's on new years day.
Its a warm inviting spot, other than the signage outside, which looks more like a hot yoga studio.
I had a toasted croissant with eggs and peameal. Very tasty.
And she had eggs benedict with smoked salmon and potato rosti.

The decor is nothing memorable, and quite basic, but the service was efficient, and friendly, and the food was spot-on, so i think 4 stars is a worthy mark.

{"text":"Brad's is one of the most kid friendly brunch place in the area if not in Toronto. I find the food is good value for money and is very kid friendly."}
{"text":"My quest continues to try every decent-looking restaurant on Roncesvalles Avenue.  
We were checking out the menu, when the doors swung open and two women emerged.  They told us the restaurant was excellent, and even recommended us a sandwich from the menu.  Taking this as good karma, we decided to give it a try.  As we entered, a table near the window had been recently vacated and the waiter was cleaning it up.  We asked if we could sit there, and waited patiently until he was done clearing.  At which point he separated the 4-seater into two 2-seaters - this place is obviously very busy on weekends.
As another reviewer mentioned, there are two seating areas - front and back. Where the front is rather crammed and invariably busier, the back seemed more spacious and relaxed.
Let me preface this by reminding you, dear readers, that I am not a psycho.  However, we ended up changing tables three times!  The first table was right beside the window.  Although when I was able to stick my arm through it, I realized it wasn't a window at all but open to the street. Next question: how soon can I get a coffee?
We ordered coffee and while waiting for it to arrive, several wasps flew in from the street and greeted us.  As stinging insects generally get in the way of the enjoyment of the meal, we moved one table inwards from the non-window. I realize this is a quirk, but my companion has an allergy, and I have not actually been stung myself and didn't intend to start now!
The wasps were temporarily held at bay, but the new table was a serious 'wobbler.'  The waitress brought our coffee, which proceeded to spill on the table because it was so unstable.  We remedied this by sticking some sugar packets under the offending leg, and were on our way to stability.  However, by this point the wasps were getting lonely at the first table and began hovering around our heads.  
This time we moved quite far back into the restaurant, and were much happier.  When we got settled, we cracked open the menus and had a gander.  My choice came down to a beef and veggie burger.  I remembered my fond first-year university cafeteria days with the greatest veggie burgers ever, although I've eaten them far less frequently since then. 
I asked the waitress what the veggie burgers looked like, and she told me it didn't look like a meat burger but rather some sort of chickpea, lentil combination.  I wasn't sure how I felt about that, so I stuck with the traditional beef burger.  My companion ordered Poached eggs and bacon with toast.
A short while later our food arrived.   But from my perspective it was less than spectacular.  The fries were made of real potatoes (not frozen crap), but they were on the soggy side.  I prefer crispy fries, which in retrospect it would have been prudent to mention.  The burger was nothing to write home about either, but not terrible.
However, the poached eggs and bacon were a hit with my companion.  
The portions were very sensible when compared with local competition: Sunrise Grill, which sizes its brunch portions for giants or possibly NBA players.
I don't think I would return to Brad's with any urgency.  It was just a bad experience from the get-go.  One has to question the wisdom of open windows on a busy restaurant-district during a heat wave, and  so soon after a month long garbage strike.  However,  I'm wondering if I made an error by ordering a hamburger; something I rarely do anymore.  In the spirit of brunch, one should order something 'brunchy.'  This shall be my mantra for further brunches."}
{"text":"My top choice for brunch on Roncies. The eggs benny served with home-fries or salad, smoked salmon, potato rosti and hollandaise sauce is a delicious choice for a non-hungover weekend morning.  Coffee could be a bit stronger, especially if your coming off a late night.

Pleasant ambience for brunch, especially in the well lit back room. Unfortunately this can go south fast when exposed to the the wretched chorus of screaming babies. This alone is the biggest factor when making my decision on whether to settle here.

On average the service is good, decent food with prices teetering on expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"I swear by this place!!!! Beef brisket breakfast is what I get every time and it never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here this past Saturday, found this place thanks to yelp! and can't really complain about a thing.

The restaurant itself occupies a former fabric dye/textile space. which is cool because there are high ceilings, lots of windows which lends to a really spacious and bright space.

We walked in off the street at 12 and were seated immediately, which is really nice.

The food and coffee were great, I ordered the brisket based on some other yelpers reviews, it was tasty, but not my preference for breakfast. my girlfriend had the croissant breakfast sandwich, and it was delicious.

Ronce is a bit of a hike for us, but in the summer when we get out bikes out again, we will definitely be heading back."}
