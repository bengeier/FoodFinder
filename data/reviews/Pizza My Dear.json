{"text":"I discovered Pizza My Dear through Yelp and when I saw the lunch time special they had (pizza for $5) I had to try it.

Well needless to say I now order regularly from them!

The $5 pizza is great; unlike some other $5 pizzas with bland cracker crust, very little sauce and generic \"cheese\", PMD's $5 pizza has a nice chewy crust with great sauce, slightly sweet and yet with a hint of tanginess. It is actually the same pizza as their normal pizzas, you just get it for $5 from 12-4pm. I can't really comment on how pure of a \"NY\" pizza it is as I haven't been to NY, but it is thin crust and the slice is foldable which I think are some of the NY pizza prerequisites.

The garlic bread is the best I have tried in Las Vegas so far. It is not a \"bread\", it is served on a pizza crust and cut in long strips, it has very creamy and buttery taste with lots of cheese and the garlic does not overpower the crust or the cheese.
Definitely try the garlic bread, it was a revelation for me, in fact i order it every time, it's that good.

Being a Chicago pizza fan I also tried their Chicago style pizzas. Chicago for me is Giordano's, Lou Malnati's and Gino's East, not just a thick crust (like the horrendous Pizza Hut pan pizza). PMD's Chicago version is not the same but the crust is not thick at the bottom and it is crammed with toppings. Unlike true Chicago style the sauce doesn't go on top but there's plenty of cheese and the most amazing thing is it's not full of grease or oil dripping when you pick up a slice. It is very satisfying though and a 14\" pie can easily feed 3-4 people (or 2 with HUGE appetite).

Service is prompt and friendly. The place is small and only has 2 booths but I'd guess almost all orders are take out or delivery.

Overall I love Pizza My Dear, they have great food, fresh ingredients, great price deals (also have many coupons and specials) and as long as I have ordered from them I have never been even slightly disappointed. Probably my favorite overall  pizza place (meaning not specializing in only one type of pizza) in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Las Vegas. Great sauces. Pizza crust is baked to perfection. Fresh toppings. Not greasy at all."}
{"text":"The pizza is always delicious. Only downside is the delivery time, which is always extra long no matter what time it's ordered. Our office just orders it way before we get hungry whenever we want pizza. Today we had the Pomodoro Secchi (white garlic sauce, sundried tomatoes, spinach, artichokes and chicken). Quotes from coworkers \"Best pizza I've ever had\" and \"Exceptional\"."}
{"text":"First tried this place about five years ago and I have never been disappointed! California original and the angry chicken are my favorites. The cheesy bread is absolutely delicious! Didn't realize they had lunch specials but now that I know, I'll be going more frequently!"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place and wanted to try it and was in the area so we tried it and the pizza was amazing! It tasted like homemade pizza without the fuss! I'm getting it delivered next time. It has a cute little table area for dine in so it would be a fun date night spot. Did that once, super sweet"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite..Ordered the mild wings and wanted a small fresh basil and mozzarella salad with the wings. Even though this was not offered on the menu, the Manager was nice enough to fix for me. I had a couple of calls to make, so, I went to my car to wait for carry out order. A staff person brought my food out to me...That's Service!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place. They have really good cheese bread with a garlic sauce. The prices are a bit high but they always have specials. The only downside is their delivery is kind of slow and our pizza isn't very hot by the time it reaches us, but they seem to service a larger than normal delivery area. We usually just pick-up :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places I have ever eaten at.  We have ordered a couple of times now and the food has been excellent.  Considering delivery is FREE, the food came super fast and has always been hot and fresh.  The pizza is excellent, crust is chewy and baked perfectly each time.  The salads are excellent...huge portions, and the cheesy garlic bread is simply delicious.  All in all a great place that is worth trying!"}
{"text":"Only place we order from.  They tell you it will be 45 minutes for delivery, they are there in 30 EVERY TIME.  Great food, prices and friendly staff.

Love it!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried Pizza My Dear was in 2009 and I knew right away I would be going back.  For just the taste it is one of the best pizza places out there.  For value, they really blow everyone else away if you order the large pizza from 10-4.  It is only $5 and tastes great!  My wife and I get one at least every other week."}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place to us so we walked in the first time and have had their pizza delivered to us ever since.This is the only pizza place we order from now ! :-) Awesome pizza and wings!!!"}
{"text":"Well this is hands down my favorite pizza place in Vegas... I have been going here for years, LOVE their Great Wall of Pepperoni and White Sauce Garlic Chicken pizza... and some times I like to mix it up with the Meatball Sub. My wife LOVES their thin crust Veggie.

Their dough, sauce and ingredients are all top notch. Sometimes I like to get some Papa Johns to mix it up, but 8 out of 10 times it's Pizza My Dear for me... plus they are right across the street from my house... WIN WIN."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza!!! I had the BBQ chicken and it was awesome, only compliant was the placing of BBQ on the edge, but my toddler set half my pizza it was so good!! I will come again."}
{"text":"I believe this is the best pizza in Vegas. My favorite is the  Mediterranean not only is the  pizza very good the people that work there are super nice."}
{"text":"My family was hungry for pizza Saturday night and we looked on Yelp to help us find somewhere new for us,  The reviews for Pizza My Dear were great so we figured to give them a shot.  When we arrived we weren't aware there were only two tables as this is a mainly pick up and delivery location but the staff was extremely accommodating.  We grabbed a couple of menus and decided on Jalapeno poppers, a small Hawaii 5-O, and a large New York style with Pepperoni, Mushrooms (HUGE), Green Peppers, and Garlic.  We also ordered a six pack of Pepsi for $4.99 that saved us a ton compared to going to a sit-down place at $3 per drink.  Everything came out hot as we were right there and it was fantastic!  Thanks to the great staff who checked on us and gave us a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I just randomly stumbled upon this waiting for dmv and I have been craving it ever since!!! I brought some home to my husband and we are going back this weekend...It's also nice to know that there are still nice people in the world....the customer service was so awesome!!!! I couldn't be happier!!"}
{"text":"We had the garlic cheese bread, $5 pepperoni pizza and a traditional pizza half bbq chicken and the other half was extra pepperoni and extra cheese.  The garlic bread was really delicious and I enjoyed the pizza one of the best I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing. White garlic sauce, feta, spinach, bacon, shrimp. Mother of God. Please help me."}
{"text":"Food was average service was good lady that took our order was very nice had the lunch special salad was average dressing was good pizza was ok nothing special place was not busy probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands the best pizza freshest of fresh ingredients and the best salads too much for one have friends over and enjoy!"}
{"text":"PMD is awesome. They have fantastic lunch specials, and their $5 pizza is much better than other places with the same deal. They don't skimp on cheese or toppings. I can't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good. Salads,breadsticks, pizza and bomb hot wings. I think this is my favorite so far here in henderson!!everything i have tried has been super yummy."}
{"text":"Very unfriendly and inpatient in taking orders , pizza may be ok but nothing replaces good customer service"}
{"text":"We have been eating their pizza for a few months now and it is always great!
Why 4 stars? they could have a broader selection.
They will customize your pizza or anything else and deliver on time or early.

Other than the pizza we make at hme, this is our new \"go to\" pizza place.
We are very thankful since it took 2 years to find a replacement when our old place closed"}
{"text":"First time camping at Oasis RV Resort and we were looking for an easy early dinner.  Lo and behold, Pizza My Dear delivers direct to our campsite!  We started with their basic Garden Salad with Italian dressing.  All of the ingredients were extremely fresh, not a single brown or wilted piece of romaine.  Plus it was enough salad for three to four people. Our pizza was \"The Bleu\" - steak, onion, Bleu cheese, with a light white garlic sauce. Absolutely delicious! We're already planning our meal for our next stay ar Oasis RV Resort on our way home!"}
{"text":"I'm staying on the strip in a hotel that has very, very few gluten free options and didn't feel like venturing out after long days at a conference. So glad to have found Pizza My Dear. The employees seem so nice! And the food was awesome. And it was delivered almost an hour earlier than expected. So...Try them!"}
{"text":"I  drive  12.2  miles  to  get  to  the  east  side  location,    past  many  other  pizza  places  and  my  reward  is  their  totally  awesome  pizza!   I've  tried  many  kinds  of  pizza  off  their  menu  and  had  my  own  combination  as  well  and  you  can't  go  wrong.   Everything  is  great  and  they're  very  helpful.  When  they  say  your  pizza  will  be  ready  when  you  arrive,  they  mean  it!    This  is  my  favorite  place  and  I'll  go  again  soon."}
{"text":"Living in Vegas my whole life, I've ate at a few pizza joints. This one has to be one of my favorites. The staff is welcoming and food is great. The pizza is very good tasting (a step up from normal chains like dominoes) but still \"quick pizza\" instead of gourmet. The prices are also way better compared to other joints. The delivery is usually fast and can be free depending where you live. Always look forward to pizza my dear. Also, my favorite is the angry chicken pizza, it's garlic sauce with Reds hot sauce, cheese and chicken. It's heavenly"}
{"text":"My BF loves using yelp so he finds this pizza delivery hoping to stay away from the chains.  I guess if you enjoy hard to navigate websites for pizza order and flavorless pizza then you might like this better than I did.  I chose to start using Yelp for reviews after this experience to help people avoid the disappointment I experienced.  I was really craving a decent delivery pizza.  The pepperoni, the cheese, the sauce,,, all basically tasteless.  I hope he doesn't force me to use this delivery again.  I'll drive to Metro or Grimaldis before I allow my taste buds to be let down like this again."}
{"text":"Well deserving of the full 5 stars. We decided to give a few different items a try and I was very glad we did! Gourmet veggie pizza is packed with loads of fresh delicious tomato, onion, spinach, generous portion of artichoke hearts. The veg is diced allowing you to get each topping in every bite accompanied by a creamy garlic sauce that really pulls it all together. What I enjoyed the most was that even with all that goodness piled on the pizza, it still managed to be light and not greasy or oily making for a happy tummy. Speaking of happy tummies they offer gluten free crusts too! Their breaded ravioli and chicken wings were also light and full of flavor. DH devoured the wings in seconds! The food arrived quickly and delivery guy was very nice. He didn't bolt away like most delivery guys so we were able to ask if everything was there.(big problem with other pizza places.) Pizza My Dear continues to be a reliable place to get some great grub."}
{"text":"Looked around Vegas for quite some time trying to find the best delivery pizza. Pizza My Dear is BY FAR the best in town, maybe even my favorite ever. Not only do they have free delivery within 4 miles of the location, but their deep dish pizza is to die for. LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"So excited!!! I have been eating at their other location across town for about two years now (close to my work) and now they are close to my house too!!!  Tonight I got to share my favorites with my family for dinner and now they are hooked! Super excited that I can call ahead and pick it up on the way home. Thank you PMD for making the best pizza and salads in town!!"}
{"text":"Never leave bad reviews but please update your hours of operations on Sundays to closing at 830p. Just went through the trouble of trying to order delivery only to get a message saying that my order would be here the next day 10 in the morning."}
{"text":"My new goto for take out.  It's not gourmet or stone oven cooked, but their pizza is pretty light and tasty, and their specialty pizzas are quite delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time in a couple of years and am wondering why we ever stopped. The Greek gyro pizza is phenomenal, as is the deep dish chicago style. Excellent ingredients and crust. My only complaint is having a maximum size of 14 inch for chicago style. Overall great pizza."}
{"text":"I wanted to give the pizza here a good rating.  I understand all the effort and expense to open up a new shop.... :(

...then they make a pie with a crust that is as dull as dishwater. The sauce is good.  Lots of good cheese. Prices are reasonable. None of that really matters if the crust ruins it.  It has no taste and is as dry as cardboard. Is it really that hard to make a good crust?

If you want to experience a good crust, just walk across the street to Brooksys.  Maybe PMD should switch their flour supplier to whichever one they use?"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places I have ever had! I wish I had known about this place sooner! Great prices as well!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizzeria.  Reasonably priced.  Ordered the \"America's 3 Favorite Toppings\"(pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom, and extra cheese) ,and they were very generous with toppings, unlike some chains that give you a thin layer of toppings and cheese over a thick layer of dough.  They made our wings extra crispy as we had requested.  They even provided paper plates, napkins, parmesan  and red pepper without us even having to ask for it.  Glad to have this place just down the block as it is now my new go-to for pizza."}
{"text":"We have lived in Las Vegas/Henderson for over 40 years and have eaten at many fine pizza establishments.  Somehow they always seem to eventually disappoint us.

Tonight I gave a final try to Pizza, My Dear and now we are hooked.  Fresh ingredients, absolutely terrific customer service and the pizza and wings are fantastic.  Due to an illness I have not had an appetite for over a month but I ate 1/2 a piece of pizza and over time three chicken wings.  A miracle for me.  Much better that medical marijuana!

Thank you Pizza, My Dear for finally helping us to find the absolute best pizza and wings in town.  I can't wait to try some of the other items on your menu:)

Sincerely,

Elizabeth and David De Lacy"}
{"text":"Not impressed... Crust wasn't done very doughy.  Wings weren't good.  Won't return go to Villa or Grimaldi's for good pizza"}
{"text":"Delicious pizzas, salads and wings! Had them deliver to a bday party and they even threw in a free cheesy garlic bread ( the size of a huge pizza). The staff was awesome from the guy who answered the phone to the delivery driver! Highly recommend for fresh and yummy pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza was bland and burned!!!! The people were slow. I thought I was going to get some good pizza but it was to good to be true. Do your self a favor and do not eat here"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Oasis RV Resort and it seamed simple to order pizza here. The pizza was delivered very fast and was some of the best pizza I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Damn ! They got some good food ,always hot and the service is really good. Hard to find good pizza out here but they got it and more!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places as of late.  It is like going back in a time machine to the family pizza places of my childhood with the small family friendly layouts, vending machines and basics like good pizza, good wings, appetizers and salads.  If you are a jerk off pizza snob perhaps you should consider other places.  Let's be honest, there is nothing magic in water for new york style pizza, deep dish pizza is in fact pizza and let's quash these nonsense pizza wars.

The prices are great and a family can have a lunch out for a reasonable price.  The wings get back to basics and do it well.  The pizza offerings are reasonably priced and use top notch, fresh ingredients.  The salads are fresh, plentifully portioned and not an afterthought.

This is a great pizza place and more people should consider eating here."}
{"text":"Ive tried pizza from all over Las Vegas and this is now my new favorite pizza joint!!! found out i live right across from one, ordered a small 12in. Pizza for myself which definitely filled me up! Got a simple pepperoni but holy shit this was good, you can tell they use some of the best water for their dough and all the ingredients tasted fresh!! We have parties at times and always end up ordering the wrong pizza from afar, now wont have that problem no more!"}
{"text":"Hey TGK fans!!! They were broadcasting the home game today and there were still tables available! I was picking up my pizzas and watched the last 5 minutes of game 1!

Tried a new combo of sauce and ingredients and it was a hit with everyone. 14\" with light garlic sauce with black olives, green peppers, red onions, and mushrooms. Wish I had taken a picture before everyone started eating."}
{"text":"Good pizza but delivery sucks I'm waiting almost 2 hrs and still haven't been delivered called they say it's on the way but where is it probably will not order again"}
{"text":"We've been living in the area for 5 years. At our sons 1st birthday party in 2012 we discovered North Side Nathan's (the restaurant previously at this location). Truthfully, we loved North Side Nathan's and were sad when we learned it closed.  

When our daughter turned 1 we wanted to order pizza and had the occasion to try Pizza My Dear. 

We were more than impressed. I know what you're thinking. \"What's there to be impressed about with a neighborhood pizza restaurant? Pizza is pizza.\" For the most part you'd be right. 

What made the experience one that caused me to write this post... And one where we will for sure be returning to Pizza My Dear was the service. 

Once the person who answered the phone caught on that we were ordering pizza for a party she took over. She asked, how many adults, how many kids? And she explained to the slice how many pizzas we needed to order based on how big the slices were. The next part was rather comical. 

She asked what time we wanted the pizzas delivered. Then my wife and I did the thing where I would yell a question to her and she yell back the answer and all of a sudden were in one of those three way conversations between me, my wife and the nice lady on the phone. So the party was at 5pm. My wife wanted the pies delivered at 3pm (you know... Just in case they were late). The nice lady insisted... \"If the party is it 5pm we will deliver at 4:45pm. We really don't want our pizzas sitting out that long.\" We agreed an ended the call. But not before the nice lady offered to send a complimentary order of their cheese sticks. She didn't have to do that. 

At 4:40pm the doorbell rang. Pizzas were in time and they were great. And the cheese sticks were gone first by the way. I recommend them!!"}
{"text":"This spot is on point from the salad, to the lasagna, and of course the pizza. It's a one stop for a family dinner, they'll provide you with everything even plates and silverware. Definitely my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Great Pizza but lousy service.  Have been ordering from here for over 8 years for both home and office.  Walked in with a coupon they e-mailed me and was told I could only use it if I ordered for the office and not myself.  
You are going to argue with me about a $5 coupon when I've been a loyal customer for over 8 years?  
Call up and give them my phone number which trust me is in their system Lady on the phone rudly says:  Cross Streets? Name? Address?  I say, all that info should already be in your system.  She rudly says, well I don't see it so if you want to order I'm going to need it.
Screw you Pizza my Dear!"}
{"text":"My kids and I love this place and quickly became our go to since their opening. Used them for large order birthday parties too. They were great helping me figure out how much I needed and coordinated timing with me. The toasted raviolis appetizer is one of our menu faves. I only wish they could extend their carry out special time past 4 because it's hard to get there before then, and slightly disappointed they increased the carry out special cost as well."}
{"text":"Consistently the very best pizza in Las Vegas, and one of the few left where you can get anchovies! Their Cheesy Garlic Bread is amazing! Great staff and service!"}
{"text":"It took exactly an hour for them to deliver but wow their chicken garlic supreme pizza is wonderful. I'll definitely be ordering it again! So delicious every single bite!"}
{"text":"DO NOT order from this place. They accepted my Grubhub order and then 90 minutes later when I inquired as to where the food was they wouldn't answer Grubhub's calls. Now they are apparently closed and we are out our time and money. The chat with Grubhub disconnected so we have to dispute the charge. Terrible experience and the fact they wouldn't even answer Grubhub's calls (their partner) despite the fact that they were still open says a lot.

Update in response to the owner's comment: It was April 20. I have the order number. It was your store."}
{"text":"I got their menu in my front door, and decided to order delivery. I ordered the NY style crust with the white garlic sauce instead of marinara, and for toppings I picked shrimp, spinach, and sun dried tomatoes. It was delicious! It all paired together really well even though I just picked from the \"make your own pizza\" menu. I would imagine that other combinations would work well. I like that they have lots of choices for toppings and sauces- more than average.
 The dough tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly. Not too thin and not too thick, soft center with a lil crispness out the outside. I've ordered the same pizza 3 more times since. I would say delivery was about 45 minutes, maybe a lil longer but it was around the time quoted and arrived hot so no complaints there. The only thing, they only included one packet each of red pepper flakes and parmesan, I'll have to remember to ask for more next time."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza I've had in a very long time. The sauce was fantastic, the pizza was perfectly cooked, and the toppings were SO GOOD. The salads were really big, and the dressings were fresh and you can tell they care about their customers!! We ordered for the first time today, and will absolutely be ordering again!! Reasonably priced and excellent portions, for 8 of us. We will probably never go anywhere else ever again for pizza!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in las vegas extremely delicious and not greasy sauce is on point .. Check'em out."}
{"text":"This is the only place I will order a pizza from now and I always get it delivered. The pizza I like the best is The Godfather (basically a meat lover's special). The people who answer the phone are really nice and patient and so are the delivery people. As others have said, their pizzas just seem to have the perfect crust and the perfect mix of ingredients. No problems or mistakes. They do an excellent job. I should explain that they have a huge menu and other things I've ordered have been just as good, but I think The Godfather is unbeatable. Thanks for the great pizza and service!"}
{"text":"Pizza my dear has become our favorite place for pizza. Hands down the best we have found."}
{"text":"I ordered online only so maybe my review may lack a bit, but as for a pizza spot, 
I almost boycott all franchised places like pizza hut or ceasars, there are SO many Mom & Pops shops out there for pizza instead of getting some frozen mass produced products.

Online was fun & easy, pics of Pizza were the real things not some fancy photo shop stuff. I will be ordering again for sure..."}
{"text":"I've been around the world and have had my share of great pizza and this pizza is worth taking a moment to share some love. The service is wonderful, very kind and polite. It's the first time did takeout and have plates come with our food. We got the Big Fat Greek Pizza and love it! We got a large it's loaded with just the right amount of toppings and the flavor is so so good! The lasagna is like homemade, it's made daily and not frozen and you can tell when you bite into it. The jalapeño poppers algae just the right amount of heat that doesn't ruin continuing eating everything else. This place is awesome! It's also clean inside and has a nice little set up with a few tv's playing sports and the parking is plenty. This place is worth every cent!"}
{"text":"Great, great service but pizza isn't that good and the wings are awful. I ordered the Margherita pizza and it had way to much basil on it and almost no sauce. The cheese was like plastic, picked a piece up from the side of the box and spit it out bc I thought it was paper, then I realized it was suppose to be cheese. The wings were really dry and it was just hot with no flavor. The toasted ravioli barely had no cheese and was not crispy but that's understandable because it was delivery. Wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"This is my spot! I the club pizza with spicy chicken is a game changer!! Hawaiian BBQ is another fav of mine. Great service, staff always seems to be in a good mood. Thank you for being part of our community."}
{"text":"The bbq chicken pizza is pretty good. The salads are big. Nice place. Unfortunately a couple days after I write this review Yelp will take it down. Of the 6 reviews I have written so far, 1 is still up. So I can pretty much say whatever I want and it'll get taken down. Unless the business is paying yelp for ad space then yelp will allow the good reviews to stay."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal!  We got the Italian House Salad, 20 mild wings and lasagna delivered. Garlic bread was soOoOo good! It fed two hungry adults for dinner and I still have lunch tomorrow. The part that set it over the top was the little thoughtfulness they had when they gave us the plates, silverware and napkins in ziplock packages. It was nice not to have to scramble to get everything. They did it for us. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We had the deep dish Chicago style pizza and it was great! I love that we could order directly from the Yelp app and have it delivered directly to our hotel room."}
{"text":"We stopped ordering pizza for months because were sick of being disappointed every time. Finally decided it was time to try again & I am so glad we did. We have ordered delivery from here twice now and each time it has arrived before the earliest given delivery time and it has been fresh and hot!! That was a huge issue with other places around here. The pizza is so delicious & if you can believe it, it is even more flavorful cold the next morning (if it makes it that long). I honestly can't wait to order another!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of their wings but otherwise their pizza and fried ravioli were great as well as their antipasti salad yumm!"}
{"text":"The white garlic sauce on their pizzas is amazing! We tried the chicken club pizza and it was delicious...the crust is great, the chicken was moist and well seasoned, and the other toppings were really good too. I didn't love the wings BUT I feel like wings don't always travel well and the sweet chili sauce was good, so if I actually went there instead of getting delivery I would definitely try them again. I highly recommend giving this place a try...we'll order again for sure.

*edit: tried the Cobb Salad this time...so delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large Chicago style pizza online via eat24. We were starving and looking forward to some deep dish deliciousness. When the pizza got to my door I was excited to dig in. When I opened the box I found a New York pizza 100% not my order. I called the restaurant and was told that they substituted a New York style as the Chicago style does not come as a large and that being said AT LEAST GET THE TOPPINGS CORRECT if you are going to so this.
 Despite not calling to check if it was ok the restaurant decided to make the wrong order and send it to me thinking perhaps I may mistake a New York pizza for a chicago.
 The person i spoke with on the phone made no attempt at fixing the issue. Eat24 made it up to me and refunded the pizza since the restaurant was unwilling to even try and make their mistake right. So the food was good the service was shady."}
{"text":"First time ordering here, everything was great, the Hawaiian pizza had real pineapple chunks in it that looks like they cut up themselves, not your typical canned pineapple everyone throws on their pizza, The cheese was high quality. I also ordered the Pizza Sub and that mushrooms were fresh, the pepperoni was perfect. lastly the cheesy garlic bread done right also. This could easily go to a 5 star rating if they stay consistent with the quality they are putting out right now. Delivery time was good, they said 45 minutes, and it was about 35-40 minutes. The order taker on the phone was a nice young lady. Delivery guy was friendly."}
{"text":"Our 1st time and it all sounded good from their flyer we had to order a lot of different things.    I think we found our pizza place it was so good we ordered the pomodoro pizza it was awesome and the toasted raviolis, a pepperoni pizza with chicken wings also awesome, and a lasagna and a chicken parm sandwich in all this food it was the sauce the garlic white sauce and the marinara also was awesome .  It's been a long time since we had good pizza at great prices my family is gonna have something from there weekly I see that happening.  Plus the ppl were very polite and helpful and they did not miss a beat in delivery even brought us plates napkins and silverware...thank I pizza my dear the food was awesome and fresh"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of pizza to begin with, nor am I by any means a pizza snob or a connoisseur. I really don't give a crap about \"true\" NY style pizza or what the heck ever. I just know what tastes good and what doesn't...and PMD pizza tastes good. 

Their pizza is not overly greasy, they have a wide selection of toppings, the sauce isn't too tangy or too sweet -- in other words, it's not too overpowering and the crust is just right. I usually get their mushroom with ham 8\" personal pizza and it is certainly a guilty pleasure. Their cheesy garlic bread is also phenomenal. You get a portion that will last you for days for $6  -- and they are damn good!

If you want true NY pizza go to NY and stop whining :P"}
{"text":"Thank you to the kid who brought that last minute delivery! Was on time and polite! Will order again."}
{"text":"OMG  well, we thought we found a great pizza place....the first two pizza's ordered were fantastic.....after that they went down hill..... the next orders  were DIFFERENT FLAT, TASTELESS.....  :(  SAD.   They were cool about giving us replacement pizza's.....but those were bad as well.  They must have changed there recipe  although they said they didn't?  So after quite a few attempts of hoping to get a pizza like the first and second one ...it just NEVER happened.  The last time I had asked the owner if she had changed the recipe she seemed to get rather (un happy) and short?  So therefore...we won't be going back....we had probably  12 pizza's from there in which only the first two were good....the rest were horrible.  Sorry guys.....but I just got tired of driving back for credits...  Hopefully one day you will get it right (this is in our opinions) a house full of people and friends who really noticed the difference...and it wasn't for the good."}
{"text":"Omg great I can't even explain how good this pizza is..and that was just my pizza. Got my daughters The Wall of pepperoni pizza exceeded my expectations
Absolutely delicious thank you guys I will be ordering again and on top of that I had wings and the brownie was awesome"}
{"text":"This place makes a really good pizza. It always taste like they use fresh ingredients. They always send me great coupons by email. & they deliver!"}
{"text":"2nd time ordering delivery here.  Came 30min before expected hot a fresh.  We ordered a small 1 topping traditional pizza (best so far I've tried,in the valley)  mild wings with side of bleu cheese for delivery they're great.  And garlic cheese bread is now a must have when ordering from here.  Super happy with this place."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza (angry chicken pizza) from this place yesterday. It was so delicious I went back for the lunch special (8\" pizza, huge salad, and a soda for $7.99) today!! This is mine and my son's new favorite place. Until we find something better, which I doubt, this is our pizza place. They're going to get tired of seeing my face LOL!!"}
{"text":"Their site doesn't do their pizzas justice. I was a little skeptical after seeing the pictures on the site but decided to order anyways and I was not disappointed with the pizza. The dough was perfect and the toppings were a perfect mix and very fresh.

Salads are fresh, Pizza is good, nice prices and will order again for sure."}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't tried Pizza My Dear before! It was amazing! I found them on Yelp, and thank the reviewer for posting a photo of the California Original, because that is all I had to see. Ordered the California Original, and it was beautiful and delicious. Loved that the cheese went all the way out to the edges, the crust was light and airy, the toppings were plentiful, and the garlic cream sauce instead of red sauce was full of delicious garlic flavor. I look forward to trying Pizza My Dear's other specially pizzas!!!"}
{"text":"They really know how to make pizza. We just tried them for the first time and we're extremely happy with the pizza and deeply appreciate it. We're in awe really.  We ordered their deep dish pizza with 4 toppings. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Authentic-style Italian food. Made to order. Good food and fair prices. Get it to go because they don't serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Best pizza place ever! I've ordered from them plenty of times always satisfied, i've gotten my Coworkers & neighbor hooked on this place as well.. 
Their Pizzas are Amazing, the Ingredients are fresh the dough is nice & soft crust is crispy., 
Their Sweet Chili wings are to die for, although I do recommend you asking if they can make them a lil more crispy, (I Love crunchy wings)
Their Chicken tenders can be a lil bigger, they are like kids sized chicken fingers :( I believe they might have forgotten that adults do desire chicken tenders just as much as kids lol.. But other than that by far a Great lil Ma & Pa place that makes Great Pizza & Wings.."}
{"text":"No seriously. The gluten free margherita pizza is the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. I've never enjoyed anything this much."}
{"text":"Everyone else has reviewed the pizza, so I'll just cover salads and wings.
Menu states the salads feed 2-3 people, which I initially scoffed at, but they actually are pretty huge. My takeout box was so full that they provided plates to eat the salad. Unfortunately, they filled it with 99% veggies, leaving no room for the grilled chicken. I had close to a cup of pepperoncini but only four slices of  grilled chicken, less than an entire tender. Vegetables were fresh and dressing tasted bottled but tasty. 

When I asked the cashier which app she suggested, she stated the wings were her favorite- the six piece order, hot, was baked in the pizza oven and nicely sauced, with lots of brown crispy bits. 

I'd come back to try another salad. Their pizza descriptions sound good (especially the Bleu!) and the wings'll make a good game day takeout option. 

TIP: They have a $5 lunchtime pizza deal (11-4PM?) but they don't specifically have lunch combos."}
{"text":"My office order frequently from Pizza My Dear. The order is always correct and the customer service over the phone and while delivering if top notch. We have done order ranging from 3 people to 20 and it is always great."}
{"text":"We ordered the Margherita Pizza, on the flyer we received there was an amazing looking pizza with fresh basil and fresh mozzarella, so we ordered it. We received free garlic cheese bread as well. The garlic bread was okay, a 4/10. The pizza was meh, the crust wasn't crispy and the basil was shredded instead of full leaves as the flyer suggested. The reason this place gets one star, both my fiancé and I got sick from it. We threw out the remainder of the pizza, no leftovers for us! Will not order from this place again."}
{"text":"You spend a little more, but the quality is worth it! 

I really like the flavor of thier pizza. I order the chicken with garlic and onions. Hubby ordered the club pizza this last time. Both of us enjoyed our meals and we had plenty left over to another meal, breaking the cost down a little, per serving. 

The staff is friendly and helpful, but you don't really spend much time seeing them as they go back to make your order right away. 

If they don't hear or see you enter, ring the bell at the counter and they'll come right out. There is a floor to ceiling wall in the middle (passway on either side) that blocks their view. 

I would definitely recommend ordering for pick up or delivery in the summertime, as their lobby gets REALLY warm with the ovens in the back and the sun beaming through their untinted windows from the front. I'm sure they had fans on, but they just weren't able to keep up."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza for my company meeting.  When the meeting recessed 90 minutes later the pizza had yet to arrive.  I had a missed call informing me that we were outside their delivery range (then why did the order go through?).  We spent the last 30 minutes of our meeting starving.  I felt so bad I authorized bonuses to be paid to the staff for missing dinner.  Their mistake cost me a significant sum of money and made me look the fool in front of my crew.  By this time the pizza place had closed and we had missed the opportunity to order elsewhere. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Yum! If you have not ordered from here yet, you should. Really seriously delicious pizza! Fresh toppings, great dough and crust. Good list of toppings. Packaging is done very nicely (they put the lettuce for our BLT pizza on the side in a baggie so it wouldn't get soggy on the carry-out ride home). Sides are tasty. Prices are pretty decent, especially for what you get. Staff are friendly. Service is speedy. I'm particularly partial to the BLT pizza. I'm getting hungry now..."}
{"text":"OUR FAVORITE PIZZA TAKE OUT IN THIS AREA!

We order from these guys allll the time! It's always pretty quick delivery and the delivery man is always super friendly. Free delivery, too! You can't beat that.

CHEESY GARLIC BREAD IS A MUST-HAVE ORDER! It's amazing, I'm not exaggerating. While it's not exactly bread, it's a pizza topped with a garlic-ranch sauce, chunks of garlic and tons of cheese. It's to die for. We order it every time.

Favorite pizzas: GREEK GODDESS and spicy buffalo chicken. 

They also have tons of coupons in their menu and are very accommodating when you use them or have special requests.

One thing I would like to see change is... the past two orders I've made, my pizza/bread were soggy. I'm not sure if it was from the steam inside the bag or what, but you couldn't even hold the slice of pizza in one hand without it crumbling."}
{"text":"Cheese bread and margherita pizza is my go to order! the stuffed manicotti is also really good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I used to go to the one on warm springs and when I found out they had opened one near me, I was ecstatic!!! The pizza's are absolutely delicious!!! Best pizza's in town!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food delicious some of the best pizza in town!
Dine in though! 
I promise when it's fresh out of the oven this pizza is much more enjoyable,unbeatable.
Only place that could come close is somewhere in New York."}
{"text":"So good! In from out of town and came here because of the good reviews. I ordered a personal cheeseless vegetarian, others ordered an olive-less vegetarian, a BBQ chicken, and hot wings. Everything received stellar reviews. I especially loved the sauce, the crust, and the clearly fresh vegetables. Bill was about $35 for four meals with drinks, more than reasonable. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here for work functions. Pizza has always been great. Tonight was a total disappointment 20 minutes outside of the 1 hour delivery window. Pizza was room temperature and tasteless. Not what I expect from a $25 pie."}
{"text":"Best in town
I am from MA and this is the only pie i can find that reminds me of home"}
{"text":"Best service quick food great prices amazing pizza&&wingsmy kids loved watching spongebob while eating"}
{"text":"I get a pizza delivery flyer on my door at least twice a week. This small Pizza delivery place in a non decrepit shopping center delivers exactly what you need when you call upon pizza delivery place! Good prices, and yummy food when you don't even want to pick up the phone to have food delivered, as they have an on line order format. I always feel like Sandra Bullock in \"The Net\" movie when I order on line. They remember your address and your only a point and click away from pizza, jalapeno poppers, decent salads, chicken fingers, and all the good food one may need on a Sunday afternoon. I'm not giving this place four stars because there is grease less pizza or a veggie plate, but when one needs pizza, and good accoutrement's call these guys!!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza.  I always get the California original.  I love garlic and this is full of garlic."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza.   Plenty of meat toppings and could tell the ingredients were high quality.   Delivery was also much quicker than they quoted over the phone.   Will order again."}
{"text":"The place has become my favorite pizza joint!! The Green Goddess, The Chicken Garlic Supreme and Lasagna Pie are bomb!! My number 1 favorite hands down is.. The Mediterranean Pizza!! It's off the hook! Perfect blend of spices. Must try the Green Goddess and DEFINITELY the MEDITERRANEAN PIZZA!!"}
{"text":"I had the Garlic Chicken Supreme tonight and it was amazing. I highly recommend it. They are new owners and they have great customer service"}
{"text":"Second time getting from PMD and the results were very good.  We order four pizzas for variety.  I haven't been just a cheese pizza person for years but I have to say this was really tasty.  Since cheese can't rely on other ingredient the sauce becomes everything and this was excellent.  A margarita pizza was a three star since cheese (mozzarella di buffalo) wasn't melted enough.  The buffalo chicken pizza (which is an abomination for pizza people) was interesting.  Finally, the lasagna pizza was really good."}
{"text":"Pizza with creamy white garlic sauce + shrimp + spinach + bacon + feta =  The cheesecake is also pretty good. I usually use them once a month on a Friday, delivery time is never more than 45-60 minutes."}
{"text":"This is THE quintessential pizza joint in Vegas. Here's the secret... it's in the sauce. Literally! A nice option at this restaurant is that you can get sun dried tomatoes and garlic. This blends with their traditional sauce for the most amazing flavor punch straight in the kisser. I was feeling experimental so I asked that fresh basil be added to the sauce as well. 

I picked up the pizza with salami and pepperoni on it. It was hot, fresh and smelled like heaven. The girl at the counter was super friendly and joked with me just as they pulled my pizza out of the oven. Great timing! I took the pizza over to my husband's parents for a nice surprise. 

My husband's mom said the pizza reminded her of making fresh, homemade pizzas with her mom as a child. She said she hasn't had pizza like that since until now. I thought that was a heck of a testimony, so I wanted to share that conversation. 

I have to agree that after having the yummy version of the sauce here, it will be difficult to go anywhere else. The quality of the ingredients is unmatched. I just really can't say enough good things about it. It's perfection, bite after creamy, cheesy delectable bite."}
{"text":"Use to be good food and friendly service but not so much any more. They frequently get my order wrong and was told during my last visit, \"Hold on a minute!\" after I rang the bell. Would normally not be a problem but after the delivery driver was a jerk in the parking lot and walked past me standing at the register, I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Any ways on time. Love the many flavor s they offer.  The menu is great and the price is right too.  

The service there is always amazing.. ask for the daily promo s."}
{"text":"The staff here misrepresent the truth when asked about the food. THIS IS NOT AUTHENTIC ANYTHING! They use the same conveyor belts that Sam's Club and Costco and Domino's use......believe me, its not very good..Sam's does a much better job. The pizza is overpriced and without flavor, absolute garbage...STAY AWAY IF YOU WANT EVEN A DECENT PIZZA."}
{"text":"Just want too say thanks pizza my dear! Been sick all week. Nothing sounded good, couldn't eat. 2day I woke up craving all my faves from you. Of course you delivered (next time I won't order gluten free!). Love you guys and gals."}
{"text":"I love the Italian salad - it's got lots of toppings and the Italian dressing is so dang good. I also ordered the green goddess pizza and it was right on point. One of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the PMD on the east side, not due to the ambiance but the pizza.   Well I finally got to go to this place.  Atmosphere 100% above Warm Springs, but they said they are working on that.  My favorite thing there is the cheesy garlic bread.  You can suck the oil out of it and the one I got today didn't disappoint.  Not as thin as I remember but still great!! Also got the California pizza which I never had before and it was very tasty.  I'm not a big bread person so the crust, didn't bother me at all (another reviewer didn't like it).  It was good.   Free delivery within 4 miles and only 3.95 outside of that area.  Not bad and I'm glad they are in my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"What more can you ask for? Good food, fast delivery and nice employees makes for a good meal at home! To top it off it was well priced!
From the gal who took our order(very nice) to the delivery guy (nice and personable) the service was great! The pizza was hot, flavorful and made with good ingredients. The wings were so good, not too much sauce, just the right amount of heat and with the right sauce!
This will be a favorite!"}
{"text":"Ordered a New York Style pizza with pepperoni, feta, garlic and jalapeño . I like how they offer 2 to 4 toppings for no extra charge."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing from here and delivery is fast! Been coming here for years! I'm from Jersey so I'm a bit of a pizza snob. So when I find good pizza I don't forget where! Highly recommended! Cheesy garlic sticks are awesome too!!"}
{"text":"Soooo I'm only Rating on thee service right now haven't even tasted my food which is something I never do! But I have to give 5 stars for the customer service and genuine care I received here!"}
{"text":"Tucked away and a bit obscured, this was a pleasant surprise to find! A full menu of salads, sandwiches, pies and meals and even the choices of 'create your own' all very reasonably priced. Cozy, clean and attractive if you wanna eat in. And GOOD eats! This is our new neighborhood pizza stop!"}
{"text":"Itsa good pizza. I feel like alot of shops are hopping on the gourmet hipster pizza bandwagon. I think the end result is more profit for them, not quality. I like this place because they have gourmet but they don't base their rep on those. Regular pizza shop pizza that is good! I grew up around philly and NYC so it's not the best pizza i've had, but it's damn good and affordable. Cant complain about the service either!"}
{"text":"We ordered for the first time, delivery. Hawaii 5-0 and the pizza bolognese. My autistic son, who has a crazy, limited diet, LOVED it and ate faster than we could feed him! The delivery guy was super friendly. I would ask to modify the online menu to make it more user friendly for cell phone usage. Very hard to read."}
{"text":"The lasagna has hewing powers, so to say. While I was recuperating from my spinal cord injuries these guys and gals really helped me out. The food, fresh as can be and the delivery helped so much. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We order delivery from here often now. I love their gluten free crust. Lots of toppings and they always bring paper plates and napkins. A nice little touch. Hubby gets NY style supreme and really enjoys it! Friendly drivers."}
{"text":"This is PIZZA MY DEAR not PIZZA MY HEART. On Apple maps, it's writted as Pizza My Heart but it's mistaken. Slightly disappointed that I can't get my surfboard t-shirt but I'm sure the pizza is just as delicious."}
{"text":"I found this place in yelp as I was looking around to find a place to eat on a Saturday afternoon close to my home.
The place is small if you want to dine in but from the activity I witnessed it looks like most people order take out or delivery.
Super friendly staff and good prices
I ordered an 8in all meat pizza on thin crust. The crust was the best I have had so far. The whole pizza was yummy.
Nice place, I will return."}
{"text":"Being ordering pizza from here for 3 years. tonight was the worst pizza they ever delivered, undercooked, messy, lake of cheese. you just lost a good customer, keep it up you will lose more"}
{"text":"While delivery was fast, the food was meh. Jalapeño poppers tasted like they had been frozen for a year and cheese wasn't really melted, threw them out. Pizza was ok but not NY style, more like Pizza Hut style. Not sure if I misunderstood or what, but I was hoping for the NY style. Lettuce in the salad was brown and old, had to throw half of it out. Kind of bummed."}
{"text":"Tried this for delivery to our hotel while on a family Christmas vacation to Vegas...( Don't judge,  we went to church). We were initially going to get pizza from the few places that through flyers under our hotel room door. As always, thank you to Yelp for saving us. Those places had horrible reviews. We then utilized Yelp to try some to look for another alternative. Cuz,' now, we all wanted pizza.  I was surprised that many of the other pizzs  places either closed relatively early, and, others were closed for the holiday. We came upon Piza My Dear.  

My only negative was that like every other food in Vegas it seem to be a bit expensive, especially since they charged us a $5 delivery fee woth an order over $50 (most others had no delivery fee).

We have a vegetarian,  and a gluten free in the group, so that post an extra challenge. 

But, despite this,  we were all very pleasantly surprised with how good the pizza, garlic bread, and salad was. We come from Detroit which is known for its Pizza, this place would give the competition a run for the money. 

We will be back at our next vacation to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is the best around! They have some of the most delicious and fun pizzas I've ever tried. The owners are super nice and have been around for almost 20 years. There is a reason why they've lasted so long-because its phenomenal.  I love this place! Try it and you will too!"}
{"text":"Overall this place really exceeded our expectations! Pizza was half vegetarian and half pesto chicken. Great flavors. Just kinda stingy on the parmesan and pepper flakes. Only gave us one of each for the whole pizza."}
{"text":"I am seriously so underwhelmed trying out Pizza My Dear tonight for the first time. I legit was prepared to love this place. I don't eat out often as I'm a bit of a health nut so Greens Proteins or similar type places or occasional sushi are about it for me when grabbing food out. I do have an insane amount of foodie obsessed friends and coworkers which is always how I get rec'd hidden gem spots in town I would have never ran across otherwise since I am just never looking. I work at corporate offices by the original location on Warm Springs and my coworkers couldn't stop raving about it. When I saw amazing yelp reviews and awesome pictures I was really psyched to see the newer location opened on the SW where I live and down the street from the LVAC I go to daily. Aside from Marco's finding let quality and slightly gourmet above average pizza in Vegas is rough even with all the mom pop wanna be so called east coast pizza places in just about every plaza that look run down and have heavy and greasy pizza. Nothing authentic or New York about it (where I'm originally from). 

Long story short got the personal size Surf m Turf pizza, Cheesy Bread, and Tiramisu. I came around 830 after gym thinking perfect non busy time where they wouldn't be rushed and expected quality pizza which I ordered in advance. When I got home both pizza and bread sticks were stale, cold, and dry as he'll and sadly didn't taste any better. There was nothing gooey, Cheesy, or fresh about it. I appreciate they offer more than the typical topping options of shrimp and steal, etc but the cheese and even sauce was non existent. Considering it was empty when I got there I'm just baffled it all tasted as if it was sitting out for an hour prior. I'm not a huge dessert person but Tiramisu is my one fav and even thay tasted like dry cake with layers of whip cream. Everything far from fresh or in a store made per the hype of this place. I get everyone has an off night but for the price and reputation I wouldn't expect such little quality. Would have loved to have found and new local spot I pass daily but so tired of how hard it is to find consistent places and actually get what you pay for..gasp. I might try the location by my work but sticking with Marco's from now on, where I should have gone tonight. What a let down!

UPDATE:
So I left a review for nothing more than the owners to know their quality wasn't living up to the reputation the night I went. I was beyond pleasantly suprised thay the lovely owner contacted me and offered me a credit to try out the place one more time. I really wasn't interested per not eating out often but respected this kind of speedy customer service as most business could care less about a bad review. I ordered a personal pizza and cheesy bread again, trying out the Hawaiian this time. When I got there to pick it up I didn't realize the very nice manager was the one who tool and made my order. He was very sincere and let me say WOW my food this time was amazing, night and day difference just looking at it before I left. Per the hype of everyone I know who loves this place the cheese sticks and Pizza actually were beyond fresh perfectiin this time with soft chewy crust, sauce, and the perfect amount of melted cheese. If I had shown you my order last time you wouldn't have believed it was from the same place. I now see whoever made it the other day just overcooked it times 500, and put next to no sauce or cheese among let it sit out so tasted like I was eating cardboard. I will definitely continue to come here when I need my pizza fix as its so close to my gym and I love the personal size option which is beyond filling however I can only hope the other employees would hold their standards of making food to those of the owners/managers instead of being inconsistent. My first meal after being looked at by staff should have never been served to me as opposed to them just assuming I wouldn't complain when I picked it up. That is a no go in the food industry as don't force the customer to eat the burned or ruined food just to save time on not having to remake it and wasting my money and business among losing customers. Most people take trying new places per first impression and that's it. 

Thanks again to mgmt for letting me try the menu at its best and when done right!!! :)"}
{"text":"That Great Wall of pepperoni is amazing. Super huge pizza, just perfect topping to crust ratio. Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Love PMD since i found out about it a few years back. Always get the deep dish and toppings depend (today was pineapple, mushroom, jalapeno and canadian bacon) and it was delicious. 

I dot have 1 gripe that kept me from 5 stars and that is because this time around the pizza was not as thick as usual. Last time i ordered it was a thick hearty pizza that tipped teh scales at 5lbs. todays was still tasty but the crust was a medium thickness not the typical deep dish thickness it came with.

Ordered delivery, told an hour came in an hour, new delivery driver, younger gentlemen extremely friendly as always.

Also love their Italian house salad, its massive and toppings are fresh. this coming from someone who typically hates salads."}
{"text":"We ordered garlic bread for an appetizer but it came with cold marinara sauce.  It should have been warmed up.  The pizza itself was average, I prefer a nice crunchy crust and it was not at all.  I also ordered light basil and it had a TON of basil on it.  The staff never came back and checked on us or even asked if everything was good.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Ordered a personal pizza light sauce and extra cheese with a side of chicken fingers. Cooked promptly, when I arrived about 10 minutes later it was almost ready. Everything was packaged so nicely and I love how they give you plates and napkins! The food was delicious and didn't have that oily greasy feeling. Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"Finally writing a review after our second order here! The food is delicious! Free delivery within 5 miles (I believe) and we have no complaints! Have tried the Tuscan with pesto, angry chicken, Chicken club, toasted ravioli and chicken fingers - pizzas were really tasty!!! If you were considering Pizza My Dear, we highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Got their flyer in the mail and I am so glad I didn't throw it away!

Ordered the pizza and cheesy bread special for lunch for my husband and I and the food was amazing 

The cheesy garlic bread had right amount of garlic to where it wasn't overpowering, the NY style pizza crust thickness was just spot on. It reminded me a lot like the pizzas back home in NIagara Falls. They will even do split toppings, we got spinach on one side and green pepper/onion on the other which was nice. Pizza was not greasy at all and the cheese they use is really good.

The inside was nicely decorated, will definitely have to return and sit down to eat inside for the lunch special. The guys that were working there today were really friendly and seem passionate about what they do which makes for a pleasant experience so I will be referring this place to friends and such."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical with this place at first, it's hidden away, but once I tried their pizza, I was hooked! I keep coming back to this place time after time! 

First I just ordered a pepperoni pizza, but the manager Aaron told me to branch out and try different menu items. I tried The Godfather and it was heavenly! I ordered a side of wings, the garlic cheesy bread and also a lasagna as well. I was not disappointed! The wings were tender inside and crispy inside. The garlic bread was the right consistency and the marinara sauce that I got with it was delicious as well. The lasagna tasted familiar, but homemade. I will be back to try more types of pizza and can't wait!

The service is great, the food is great... I say if you're looking for something different (extra points because its a mom and pop owned restaurant) from your usual Pizza Hut or Papa Johns, Pizza my Dear is the way to go! Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I saw this place right around the street from my apartment and decided to try it out. It was pretty good pizza! I ordered a large pepperoni and some breadsticks. The pizza was good, sauce was great, yummy cheese and I even liked the crust! It was tasty and I like to dip it in marinara sauce. Atmosphere was good too and the staff was friendly. Will definitely return when I get the craving for pizza."}
{"text":"I can not get enough of this place. So fresh, great friendly service, enormous portions. I tried them once and I've never tried anywhere else, no need-it's that good!!"}
{"text":"I am sad to write this review as this place had great potential with non-frozen mozzarella cheese, and it made a big difference. Unfortunately they have poor quality control which has resulted in cold pizza on 2 out of the 6 times I have ordered from them. The 2nd time it happened (both times with the same driver, and both times the delivery seems to take an extra 10 to 15 minutes), I called to complain about it and see whats up with this driver. I was given arguments and excuses and in the end a 10.00 credit for next time w/o any admission as to why my pizza was cold. One of the highlights was \"some drivers have old cars which may not have heaters\". Really? last I checked, heaters have been a standard feature of the automobile since the 1930s. With the huge selection of pizza joints in south vegas, my advice would be to not bother with this one. For a lousy 10 bucks and not so much as an apology for their customer, I sure wont be back."}
{"text":"For the price of and taste of 3 customized traditional NY pizzas and one Chicago pizza, you have 12 happy ladies! Service was quick and it was delivered to our hotel (Huge thanks to Tyler). Hands down, everyone all agreed this is really great pizza. The crust is just right, generous toppings, and we all couldn't get enough. No need to try out more pizza places!"}
{"text":"Chicago pizza is freaking bomb!! Wings was ok."}
{"text":"New to area...so relaxing with friends we decided to order a pizza...found this on yelp & they delivered...BEST PIZZA EVER ANYWHERE!!! Perfect & paper thin...can't wait to order it again!!"}
{"text":"OMG! Just placed my very first order tonight! My hubby wanted to try the, 'Godfather', and it did not disappoint. Light on the sauce, and heavy on the toppings. The garlic bread was awesome as well. Light, and crispy! Customer service was great on the phone, and the delivery guy was a sweetheart! Thank you, Pizza My Dear! We thoroughly enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Loved the food had an America's favorite and some mild wings. Would have given 4 stars except for the dining experience .Staff was friendly but multitasking so they give you a menu and then you ring a bell to place your order. Food came quickly but we ate on paper plates ( the really really thin kind) and used plastic silver ware which was in an open basket on the table. Place was also messy and looked dirty. Will probably try the take out as eating in was more like a picnic."}
{"text":"When I last talked to the manager he told me that since he sent another pizza out that made everything square. That is what made me very angry. I wake up very early to work very long days so dealing with something like that is a major inconvenience for me. What really makes it a damn shame is that I was a first time customer and the pizza was actually very good."}
{"text":"Nice place overall. But you eat with plastic silverware and the salad, which was pretty good, was in a plastic container.  
The pizza was a little under cooked and just a little below average in my opinion. The staff was friendly.  I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Wow just got off the phone with the rudest girl who's ever taking a pizza order ever from me.  I almost hung up twice because of her horrible phone edicate.  I've ordered from this place many times with and everyone's was nice. They should really train or fire the horrific voice and bad attitude who answered the phones Sunday night."}
{"text":"Great Pies 
Tons of Toppings
Try the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich
Ask for it Not on Menu"}
{"text":"We have been going to the one on Warm Springs & Spencer and when this one opened up closer to my house we had to go in and see if it had that same magic flavor and YES it did not disappoint. If you want toppings, you will get toppings they certainly don't skimp on that. Don't forget the cheesy bread, tried it once and it has to be on every order now, sandwiches for two I mean they are big!! nice friendly staff and clean restaurant"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service.  Everyone in the store was super friendly from start to finish. We got the family meal deal which was a 16\" large pizza, 20 wings and 12 garlic cheesy breadsticks for $30 something dollars. The taste and quality were on point. If you happen to be looking for a new pizza spot in town look no further. Excellent on all accounts."}
{"text":"Pizza was great but the sauce is a little on the spicy side. Not a problem for us. 
Free delivery was very fast and no problems even though we were in a large RV park."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Pizza my dear for about a year now, and have always had great customer service, the food is always so good, and I have never had to wait long for delivery. Definitely my go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Loyal customer 4 months. Ordered 1-2 x week. Dropped 1-2 thousand here. New driver arrived 60 minutes late then pulled a cheap hussle to scam a $20 tip. Lip service from manager. Never again."}
{"text":"OMG!! Best pizza in Las Vegas!! We always order this at work and this time I ordered it for my family and boy oh boy it's a hit!! Thanks Pizza My DearIf i could give more than 5 Stars I would. I have referred a lot now to my friends.. they sure live it too Our favorite is the white sauce and shrimp. After I this review I will be ordering another pizza!! Totally addicting!! Thanks Pizza My Dear."}
{"text":"AWESOME PIZZA!! Good quality ingredients, nice staff, great price point.. Glad to have in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I've ever had. I order the gluten free Crusted my big fat Greek wedding pizza. It came out fast and delicious. I have told everyone about this place. My friend ordered the god father pizza and loved it. Must try!!"}
{"text":"Thursday January 4th 2018  8:37 PM

I have been driving by this place for six and a half years.  We finally bought a home in the area a year and a half ago.  We've been going to the Rosati's on Hualapai & Desert Inn rd.  Never again.  

I ran out to get my boyfriend a steak sandwich before he gets home from work.  He said he already signed up with their rewards and give them his phone number.  I pulled into the Smith plaza from W. Saddle Ave (behind the Smith's), made a right on S. Old Flamingo Way.  It's dimly lit store front, and I wasn't sure it was open.  I parked at the door and went inside, it felt cozy, just like being on the East Coast again.


Angelique was my cashier, I asked how she was doing and replied with a smile, \"good and you?\", she seemed nice.  I let her know I'd like a steak sandwich with chips to go and my boyfriend signed up for the Rewards Program but didn't get a confirmation email back.  She asked for his information and added him to the program with our address and major cross streets.  She said it would be a few minutes.  I sat in their comfy chair by the kitchen and waited about 11 minutes and she popped out the kitchen with the bag of delicious aroma.

It was torture driving home with the to go bag, I made it home shortly after my boyfriend was home.  I heard, \"mMMmm\",  figuring it must be good if he isn't saying anything, ha ha!  He ate about three quarters of the sandwich and said he was stuffed.  I was eating homemade roast when he offered me the other half and I said sure.


I might of died and went to heaven.  The twelve inch bread, it's golden brown to perfection!  The peppers and onions were fresh.  The mozzarella cheese and the almost paper thin shaved steak was seasoned just right.  I honestly thought about if my dad ever decided to visit I must take him (he dislikes Vegas).   The sandwich is exactly like the place my dad would bring me to in Pawtucket, RI called House of Pizza.

I will definitely be back to try their New York style pizza!!!  I also want to try their tiramisu (my favorite)."}
{"text":"I am definitely a pizza lover.  It was a rainy day so stayed at the hotel and ordered delivery. The good and the bad :  first the good, the person on the phone was extremely polite, friendly and patient as I decided what to order.  The delivery to my area was free. The delivery man was also very friendly. I ordered a mushroom, basil, onion, and spinach pizza. The ingredients were fresh and plentiful. Now the bad : I was quoted a 45 - 60 min delivery time and it took one hour and twenty minutes. The pizza was Luke warm. The crust is soft and doughy. The biggest disappointment for me is the minimal amount of to tomato sauce on the pizza, it was very dry. If I were to order again from them order way in advance and ask for extra sauce."}
{"text":"So far, the pizza is great. My daughter loves it and she's pretty picky. We usually get pepperoni with marinara sauce. Everything else though, aside from the drinks, is not so great. The mozzarella cheese sticks, NY cheesecake, tiramisu, chocolate chip cookie pie and wontons have all been kind of gross. Tastes as if they were frozen and then thawed and/or heated up. I still order from them but just the pizza. They are courteous and usually on time if not early. They even offer plates and napkins with each order. I may try something else on the menu just out of curiosity. If the pizza is good, there should be at least one other item on the menu that's just as good."}
{"text":"We ordered a simple, good old-fashioned pepperoni pizza and I have to say It's the best I've had in a really long time. The cheese was the star, and it was flavorful and creamy. The crust was crispy on the edges and soft and fresh on the inside. The pepperoni was not overly greasy even though there was a nice amount of the meat distributed evenly. The order arrived quickly, efficiently, hot and fresh and the driver was polite and friendly. I could not have asked for more. Thanks for making it a great Saturday with pizza and movies, Pizza My Dear!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!!  We just finished eating and it was amazing!  We ordered a Chicago style and my god  BEST pizza we've had in Vegas thus far.  We will be back"}
{"text":"My quest for great pizza continues. The pizza here was average. I actually think little ceasars has them bet. We also ordered raviolis, jalapeno poppers, and wings which were all baked which I didnt like. The wings had little sauce on them. Poor quality which is unfortunate because I was hopeful after reading other reviews."}
{"text":"The gourmet veggie pizza is to die for! From the garlic white sauce to the array of veggies on it. It's hands down probably the best combination ever with lots of flavors. Pizza My Dear, keeps me surprised and my tummy happy every time I order.thanks so much for an awesome job and for the awesome staff! Go support your neighborhood pizza shop."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food.  Great bone in wings!  Very helpful, young man helped me carry out the family feast to my car."}
{"text":"We received a flyer in the mail today and decided to give them a try.  Amazing!  We tried the Godfather, the Big Fat Greek and the Hawaiian BBQ.  We will be ordering from them again and again.  Toppings are generous and delicious.  We also ordered the Antipasta salad which was large enough to feed the whole family.  You gotta try them - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Great Wall of Pepperoni and a side of mozzarella sticks and had them delivered to the MGM.

Pros:
- The pizza was absolutely killer. I would definitely get it again. I love the blend of cheeses, it was cooked well, and the crust is soft and delicious.
- Customer service. I ordered via Yelp and got a call right away about the delivery situation (see 'cons' below)
- The delivery driver was fast, courteous, friendly.

Cons:
- Delivery to the MGM: you cannot get delivery to your room. This is not specific to Pizza My Dear and probably true for most casino hotels.
- Mozzarella sticks were awful. Just order more pizza instead."}
{"text":"Been ordering pizza here for years now.       Always good but last Monday night they were exceptional.  The young girl that answered the phone was so very professional.  Not usually when you call these places.     She asked all the right questions, repeated the order back, and it was a big order and the delivery time was almost exactly what she said it would be.     Good job guys and girls.     One of the best pizzas and huge Italian menu to boot.      Not overpriced and no charge for delivery.   Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Their pizzas are delicious. The dough is light and crispy. They use a specific type of cheese that is flavorful and not too greasy. My favorite is their Hawaiian BBQ pizza. Amazing pizza and great staff."}
{"text":"Let me first just say OMG!!! Being the crazy Italian food lover that I am, its hard to get good quality pizza in Vegas. My co-worker just bought some for the office today... and now I'm getting it for dinner tonight after work, just so my boyfriend can see just how incredible it is! Did I mention the garlic cheese bread?!?!?!? The words to describe the flavor don't come to mind, because there arn't any! I'm speechless... it was literally that good!"}
{"text":"Very good wings! 
Finally a place that has lower priced YET STILL GOOD food.
Pizza price is right on for whats its worth.
Good pepperoni though!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza place in vegas. I got there lunch special 1. 8 inch new york style pizza with 3 toppings. Pepperoni, onions and pineapple, salad and a sofa all for 8.35. Pizza tasted great. Great service."}
{"text":"been enjoying the chicken club pizza for over 5 years now , its always excellent , consistency matters!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here for the first time and I would definitely order again, they don't skimp on toppings, sauce is tasty. The New York doesn't taste much like a true New York pizza but then again we don't live in New York!! Also got the cheese bread and it had a fantastic flavor!!"}
{"text":"Best PIZZA in town - hands down!! Forget Metro Pizza, Grimaldis and any other pizza place.. this place is the REAL deal for authentic pizza. Great sauces, fresh mozzarella and topings! Been in business over 12 years -- because they do make the best pizzas in this town.  This is not a sit down place, order to deliver or pick up.  Make your own pizza -- they do it perfectly every time!  Consistent quality and delicious!"}
{"text":"Loooove Pizza My Dear! Since we moved to Vegas from Orange County, we had a hard time finding a good pizza. Stumbled upon this place because of Yelp, and have yet to be disappointed. Their Chicago style pizza is very good, rivaling Chicago itself. Chewy, still crunchy, and deeeeeep, just how we like it. The wings are to die for, very juicy, fall off the bone. Then the jalapeño poppers. Made with cheddar cheese, instead of the regular cream variety. Very good! Hit the spicy spot, for me at least. We've also had their traditional crust, and it is all very good. Again, chewy, but still crisp. Their pricing is also very competitive. We can get the 12 inch Chicago style (more than enough), a small order of wings, poppers, extra dressing, all for like $26! We love this place!"}
{"text":"Got margarita pizza. Yummy!!!!  Also got a salad-antipasto.  Was okay.  Way too much lettuce for everything else.  Perhaps they should make it smaller so it seems like you get more toppings.  Or add some cucumbers or other vegetables!    Went back and got w vegetarian pizza and Mediterranean salad.  Both were pretty good.   Right proportion of lettuce and veggies.    My husband got a meat sandwich he loved it.  Good job Guys!"}
{"text":"The pizza was on point! Fresh ingredients tasty suace nd good dough. Way better than traditional pizza franchise's"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Conventionally excellent. Fresh ingredients, well-made. The staff is fantastic. Will come again."}
{"text":"My kid had a birthday party at Pump It Up -- the large, indoor play area with inflatable bounce houses and stuff -- and Pizza My Dear is their pizza vendor. So we ordered about 10 pies. The crust was chewy and almost rubbery. Toppings were nothing special. I've definitely had worse pizza -- Chuck E Cheese comes to mind. But, I've also had much better pizza elsewhere around town. The only way I'll eat their pizza again will probably be at another kid's party if it's held at Pump It Up."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were entertaining some friends yesterday and decided to try PMD after getting a flyer for their new location. We ordered a large pizza (the specialty one with just lots of extra pepperoni), some mozzarella sticks, and chicken fingers.

First the good : the pizza was seriously the best delivery pizza I have had in the 5 years I've lived in vegas. The crust, sauce, and toppings were all 5 star rating, BUT....

The bad : the chicken fingers looked and tasted like something that should be served only in prisons. They were very obviously just frozen low quality, slightly oversized chicken Mc nuggets. Considering how good the pizza was I was suprised that they would even serve something of this low quality.  The mozzarella sticks were the definition of mediocre, also seemingly just frozen and fried, but not as bad as the chicken.

Despite the bad fingers and meh mozzarella sticks, I'd still not hesitate to order from there again just for the tasty pizza if it wasn't for the rude and moronic delivery driver. Our order was just under $40, and after giving him 2 $20's, my girlfriend gave him a third $20 and asked for change so she could tip him. He begrudgingly made change while making rude comments about this being \"his 3rd job of the day\", and then after getting his tip insisted that she still owed him another $20! Not wanting to make a scene or get me involved (because I would have made a huge scene) while we were entertaining guests, she just gave him the $20. So we paid $60 (plus the all time most UNDESERVED tip) for $40 worth of pizza. I expect management to make this right, the pizza was soooo good and I'd hate to deprive myself of it because of crappy customer service on our first order."}
{"text":"This place has great food and service. The messed up our first order and when contacting them they issued a credit for a replacement order on our account."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I'm on a strict diet since being diagnosed with cancer, and my one splurge is pizza on Fridays. HOWEVER! I don't eat gluten or dairy...and they make such a good gluten-free pizza--even with vegan cheese!! YAY!! Can't find that many places, and I'm so grateful this place is right up the road from us. Our orders are always correct, and our deliveries on time. Did I mention it's AMAZING GLUTEN-FREE, VEGAN CHEESE PIZZA?!?! 
They have other amazing items too. Hubs loves their chicken parmesan sandwich and their \"regular\" pizzas. Their wings are delicious, too. Thanks for having such extensive (and healthier) options! I appreciate it SO much!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Delivery was made as scheduled and driver found us easily even though we were in large resort.

Ordered the pizza bolognese and it was the best Chicago style pizza I've had. Great combination of meat, sauce, and cheese. Crust was thick, but crunchy. Antipasto salad was excellent.

We had enough for four easily with the 12 inch size.

Excellent customer service from order taking to delivery- a wow dining moment.

Would choose this place anytime in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet unlike their delivery timing. The pizza is decent, kind of like papa johns or pizza but with a better crust. Its definitely not top notch but its good for the price. Its pretty cheap for a Vegas pizza in my opinion. The only ongoing issue I have with this establishment is when ordering on eat24 it states a 45 - 60 minutes wait time for delivery. Every time I order I am contacted shortly after through the app stating the restaurant needs more time. I don't end up receiving my delivery until 1.5 to 2 hours later. This causes a hungry person thinking their food is on the way to become Hangry. Try them if you are on a budget but I wouldn't suggest delivery, just go pick it up."}
{"text":"Ok, we ordered here a few times hoping that yelp ratings are accurate. Few times it was ok until yesterday. We ordered half supreme and half cheese. I swear it taste like and look like it came out from the box. Very disappointing! You lost one customer here. I'll order my pizza somewhere else."}
{"text":"Got a personal pizza and salad last night and it was okay. 

I only gave it 3 stars because while the salad was DELICIOUS, the pizza was only about a 5-6 outta 10. I will say the pizza is 1000x better than any chain pizza place though. The Mediterranean salad however is AMAZING. The portion was huge and the ingredients were so fresh that I didn't even use any salad dressing. 

Another positive was that I called in for a pick-up and my food was ready right on time. Nice & hot too. 

For the price and taste of the food I would definitely go back... I just wouldn't find myself craving PMD's pizza specifically."}
{"text":"I like this place. I usually get food to go here, and probably most of their other customer do because I've never seen anyone actually eating in here. Last time I was here, I got the sandwich board special (for those of you under 30 that's a sign that sits on the sidewalk ;) ) It was a 12 inch pizza for like 6.99 And it was good. Good sauce, thin NY style crust. Yum!"}
{"text":"We ordered the California Original and added shrimp and pineapple. My coworkers and I would have to say we were pretty surprised at how good the pizza tasted! Excellent taste with a burst of flavor in every bite. 

Also, called to make sure they could do half the pizza without the meat just because we have a coworker who is a vegetarian. Luckily I spoke with an employee with great customer service and was willing to help and make sure the order went through correctly. Will order again in the future!"}
{"text":"There is such a thing as bad pizza.  This place has  Chicago style pizza and it was TERRIBLE!!! I ate a half a slice and threw out an ENTIRE pizza. I'd rather eat a Tony's frozen pizza or I can't believe I am saying this (gulp) Dominoes. The crust was over done and very thick. I have had the NY style pizza and that is decent I will stick to that if I ever get delivery from them again. I love fried raviolis and this place has them but it's really hit and miss if they overdo them. I don't know if this place is worth it.  I am very on the fence about them because they are so inconsistent and throwing away a $16.00 pizza does not bode well for this place.  I can't take the chance of wasting my money again. If you want good REAL Chicago pizza do pizza amore on Durango. The service over the phone is hit and miss too.  They took my credit card and charged it without giving me the total first. I had to ask for it.  I've ordered from this place four or five times now and it's NEVER the same."}
{"text":"I had set up a big pizza delivery order for my daughter's birthday and Pizza My Dear did not disappoint. I had called to place an order a few days in advance and I prepaid. The day of my daughter's party, I called to confirm that they will be delivering at the address and time I requested and they were on it. The delivery man got there right as I expected with no issues with the food order at all. The food items that were a hit: cheesy garlic bread and wings. The pizza was a hit too but I think I should've ordered more garlic bread and wings than pizza. I had ordered way too much pizza."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been looking for a new pizza place recently when I happened on a Facebook posting asking for people's favorite pizza in the south/southwest. Pizza My Dear came up a few times so we decided to try it out and I'm do glad we did! There are so many yummy sounding pizzas (both classic and gourmet) that we had a tough time picking one. We finally decided on the \"Angry Chicken\" and actually got a 16\" large for just the two of us because the prices were so reasonable. We'll definitely be back and cannot wait to try more of their pizza concoctions!"}
{"text":"good pizza, sauce is not sweet like other pizza locations near by. Have only done delivery which is pretty quick- staff that answers the phone is a little rude at times- but give this place a solid C+/B-"}
{"text":"Stopped for pizza since it was close by and I had heard great things about it!  We ordered the 4 topping pizza and wings special.  The pizza was made fresh To order and was incredible! The pizza was not too greasy and the sauce was just right!  The chicken wings were plump and cooked perfectly. They also have free delivery and a reward program! Definitely good eating!"}
{"text":"This place was magnificent!! We ordered delivery.. the lady on the phone was great! She was kind and very helpful.. the food got here in a reasonable time frame.. The food was so delicious! This will be our new Italian food restaurant! 5 star from us! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great!! I love how it wasn't greasy vs Pizza Hut pizza. The BBQ wings were basically wings that they draped BBQ sauce over. Meh. They have good lunch deals and reasonable prices. I would visit again."}
{"text":"This is the first gluten free delivery pizza in 10 years!! Needless to say, yummm!! The gf crust was excellent! And they make it in house! Toppings were of excellent quality too! Mediterranean salad was bomb! And a huge amount, fed all three of us with some to spare! Thanks for the gf tasty deliciousness! My belly is so happy!"}
{"text":"I love Pizza My Dear.  Pizza overall in Vegas is not great but this is in the top two of the good places here.  Everyone there is always friendly to you and the food is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"My favorite gluten free pizza spot in Valley! The wings are amazing too, I'd definitely give them a call the next time you're craving some delicious marinara sauce."}
{"text":"The salad was good. But the pizza so far has been ok at best. Those guys pies are much better. The pizza is extremely undercooked."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for that Angry Chicken pizza alone.  Spicy, white garlic sauce, cheesy goodness and grilled chicken covered with a swirl of Frank's Red Hot.  Wow!  I'm still dreaming about this pizza but my waistline will not allow me to eat this twice in one month.

My office regularly orders from Pizza My Dear because they deliver, have solid pizza and a good antipasto salad.  In addition to the aforementioned Angry Chicken, I really like the pepperoni pizza.  Sauce has good flavor and cheese to ingredient ratio was perfectly on point.  The crust is good even to someone like me who feeds the crust to my Frenchies.  I typically go for thin crust, but the regular crust here is fairly thin.  If you go thin crust, it is easily overwhelmed by ingredients.  

Of the pizza deliveries I have tried in the area, Pizza My Dear is tops."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in town, i moved from Detroit & the selection here for quality pizza places is not very good.   I have been very satisfied with pizza my dear."}
{"text":"After a terrible experience with a nearby pizza place my co-workers and I checked out Yelp and saw that Pizza My Dear was only about 1.5 to 2 miles away from our office. So we thought we'd check it out. I was very skeptical. Pizza in Las Vegas is usually very spotty at best. When we walked in I was even more skeptical since the front area is quite small with only about three booths.

Pizza My Dear has a great lunch special which is an 12\" Pizza with one topping for $5. Yeah, that's right 5 bucks! I was really not expecting much for a price like that, but when the pizza came it was hot, cheesy and delicious and the crust was not overwhelming - I ordered beef for the topping. It was actually really good much to my surprise. We now make a trip to Pizza My Dear for lunch at least once a week. Also, the service is pretty fast. You can be in and out for a quick lunch in about 30 minutes.

I also tried their delivery service this weekend. I got the Pizza & Wings special which is  at 16\" pizza (very big) with up to 4 toppings and 20 wings for only $26.99 plus free delivery. I was also very specific about thin crust this time. I'm very wary of ordering thing crust since most places basically ignore this.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Pizza My Dear and intend to keep going back!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this pizza.  Very tasty and comes with this \"pizza seasoning\" this is off the hook.  Delivery guy was prompt, but I handed him a large bill and as I stood there waiting for change so I could give him a reasonable tip he turned and left giving himself a +$5 tip.  That rubbed me the wrong way a bit."}
{"text":"They send out coupons that say will deliver within a 4 mile radius. Okay cool call in your order and its against the company policy to deliver, its only carryout. Seriouslly? Get your shit together."}
{"text":"From start to finish not great. Ordered a steak sandwich. The price unreasonable. Trying to order was nothing short of frustrating. I really could have bought steakumm and made it taste better and this was grocery freezer quality meat . The meat was dry, peppers and onions barely grilled. To receive order was almost an hour wait when told 45 minutes. Won't order from here again. I'll starve first"}
{"text":"the veggie pizza is pretty good. skip the other stuff and just order the pizza. also had their Chicago style and that wasn't too bad either. it's not the best pizza I've ever had but probably better than most especially in that area. check it out and experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"awesome tasting pizza and low cost. ask them  to put pesto sauce underneath the red sauce..its extremely yummy"}
{"text":"Great customer service great staff,  very helpful & answered all of our questions told us about the specials and asked if we needed anything else.  Very affordable and delicious.  Quick service!  Appreciate them."}
{"text":"This was right across the street from the ice skating building. Very convenient. Very clean and everyone was extremely friendly! 
I forgot the wonderful lady's name that was there but she gave my boys some dough to play with and they loved it! Kept them occupied while waiting for the pizza. The pizza was amazing! Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"We got a flier for Pizza My Dear in the mail and had it sitting on the counter all week. Today we ordered delivery- free because we live within 4 miles! 

We got a medium margherita pizza, New York style. It was so flavorful and perfectly cooked. Plus, we were devouring it 30 minutes after placing the call! Also came with complimentary paper plates and napkins. Loved it!

We will definitely be ordering again. Sorry Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I ordered the gluten-free version of BBQ chicken pizza today with spicy BBQ sauce and no cheese (I do away from cheese. Don't criticize me plz, lol). It was the best gluten-free pizza I have ever had-way better than California Kitchen Pizza's gluten-free pizzas. I loved the abundance of sauce and onions. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked. I could not stop eating it! I seriously finished the whole 10-inch pizza in one seating ALONE in bliss! I fully endorse and support this joint. I love it! 

The only criticism for this place is the paper plate for the delivery pizza. Be more green!!! I have plates at home. :) I just will have to remember to ask them not to give me paper plates next time. Great job you guys! 

Next time, I am trying the vegetarian pizza. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"This establishment is and has always been amazing! They are so personal and I love the positive energy they always have. The food? Amazing! Everything is fresh and you can tell they take there time . If you are looking for a fast food pizza place they are not what you are looking for. They provide excellence in every step of the way; from the food to the service and they happen to be \"fast\" at it! Love this place !! Keep it going guys !!!"}
{"text":"Found this place via the Eat24 app. I'm an over the road truck driver and food options can be limited in my position. I was in the area and needed some food of a Sunday evening and - well - let's say pizza tends to be a pretty good option. I wasn't feeling like ordering from a chain place, and I love supporting local business, so I took a peek at the menu and liked what I saw. As an added bonus and worth an extra star, they delivered to my truck. 

I ordered The Michelangelo, as I wanted some veg on my pizza, and the cheesy garlic bread. The toppings were excellent and generous and the 8\" personal size filled me up. The bread was also very good. All told the damage came to $15 and change - excellent for delivery, and even though it was expected to take an hour my driver showed up in 40 minutes. If I find myself on this side of town again I'll definitely order from here."}
{"text":"I hadn't ordered from them in awhile and decided to give them another try because they used to be great and hoped they had worked out their problems the last few times.

Ordered some wings and a salad.  

About 5 minutes after I ordered, they called me back and said, \"We don't deliver out there anymore.\"  Fine.

Yet, a few minutes after that, I get an email saying they charged my card for the order anyway.

I called back and talked to the manager.  He told me I'd get a refund in 3 to 5 days.  When I said I needed that money to order food tonight, he said, \"Too bad.\"

If they had ANY customer service skills AT ALL and actually CARED about their customers, they would have delivered the food they charged me for....and they certainly wouldn't have said \"too bad\" when I told them I had no money for food after they charged me.

Outrageous."}
{"text":"I needed a lunch spot that delivered and found Pizza My Dear near work. When I called in the order the man I talked to was friendly. He was able to take my card by phone and I was able to include the driver's tip in the card charge.

The lunch specials are a great deal. I went with the side salad, 8\" pizza, and soda special for $7.99.  Delivery has a $10 minimum so I added a slice of tiramisu too. I was quoted 45-60 minutes for delivery, but the driver was standing in front of me within 30 minutes. He was also friendly and brought me everything I needed including plates, forks, and plenty of napkins. Most importantly, my order was accurate. I also appreciate that the person taking my order and the delivery driver listened to my instructions on how to find me in the building I work in. My workplace is notorious for people getting lost or going to the wrong place so I appreciated that they found me without a problem.

My lunch was really good. The side salad was a generous portion and included more than just lettuce. The pizza was really good too. I loved the crust and the flavor of the pizza. I wasn't planning to eat the whole thing, but it was so good that I finished it. The tiramisu was also excellent, better than most tiramisu I've had at nice restaurants. 

You can't beat great service, reasonable prices, delivery, and great food!"}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetarian pizza with some cheesy garlic bread and both were delicious!  I loved all of the veggies on the pizza..so fresh.  I will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here last night on grub hub and it was excellent. I ordered the Greek salad and it was amazing with the Greek vinaigrette. We also got a cheese pizza and chicken club pizza and both were delicious. The delivery time was great! Only about a half hour when grub hub quoted an hour and ten minutes. So glad a found a new pizza place!! And the best part is that the delivery was free!"}
{"text":"When pizza is good, its good, who cares about the style!  Pizza My Dear pizza is just plain good, good sauce, good crust and even amout of toppings.  Everything was fresh (no canned mushrooms) and the service was friendly and fast.

Also the price is reasonable and they often have good specials."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is great and the staff is equally great! I personally observed a delivery guy walk in and see someone at the register, soon as he was in the door asked \"have you been helped?\" If that is not awesome customer service I don't know what is! I highly recommend the pomodoro secchi! My boyfriend likes the God Father."}
{"text":"Excellent!!

I run the Pizzarazzi Meetup, and I brought a group of 14 people to this location which took up every seat they had. The staff was SO kind, SO accommodating, and SO attentive without hovering. I went in early to make sure I could grab seats for my group, and the employees allowed/helped me move tables and set up. They made sure everything was clean and ready to go.

We tried the pepperoni, the America's 3 (pepperoni, sausage, mushroom), Angry Chicken (buffalo chicken), Chicken Club, & gourmet Veggie. All were excellent! The crust was great, sauces were great, toppings were delicious and generous. Mediums were $14 and larges were $17. We, also, tried the cheesy garlic bread and the warm chocolate chip cookie pizza. Delicious. We all left stuffed and every single person was praising the food.

They, also, played great old music...like Rat Pack hits.

I highly recommend this place. The pizza was awesome and the staff was fantastic! I am a fan!! There were several other pizzas I already want to go back and try like The Bleu (steak, onions, peppers, bleu cheese, garlic sauce) & The Chicken Garlic Supreme.

Check them out!"}
{"text":"I try not to be too critical, especially because I tend to really like this place. My last TWO orders were wrong. I called last time to inquire about my order and was told it was simply input incorrectly. No resolution was given. Tonight I called and spoke with a manager who sounded about half my age and I expressed that not only was my order wrong this time but it was last time as well. The male manager told me that they have hired new people and for my trouble he could give me $5 my next order. I hoped to hear an apology but got a \"quick, get off the phone, I'll give you $5 off your next order for your troubles\" response. I will be looking for our new  pizza place as I deserve better treatment than this."}
{"text":"ordered a ton of pizza's and wings today for work from Pizza My Dear, delivery time of 11:45.  
They arrived around 11:38 which was perfect.
I ordered 2 Cheese, 1 Margherita, 2 Great Wall of Pepperoni, 1 Vegetarian and 1 Supreme.
All pizzas and wings arrived hot!
Pizza was a 7 out of 10.  Not the worst pizza Ive ever had but not the best either.  The wings were ok.  They come dry with the sauce on the side which I wasn't crazy about.
Overall, great service, so so food!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place and finally did.  NY style pizza was great, the garlic cheesy bread was phenomenal.  Wasn't crazy about the wings, but I believe that there were baked.....but the BBQ sauce was tasty.

They are definitely one of my favorites.  I don't like reheated pizza, but I put a slice in the toaster oven the next day.....excellent.

The only thing that disappointed me was the Yelp 10% off link, and it didn't take the 10% off.....but I will definitely be ordering from here again.

Also, when I picked up the food, the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for delivery last night because the food here is awesome.  We got the Gourmet Veggie, The Great Wall of Pepperoni and The Godfather.  We had a large group, most in the group have heard about this place but never tried them.  Needless to say, there are a lot of new fans for this place now.

The pizza arrived pretty much on time as to what was quoted when the order was placed.  The pizza's were exactly what we ordered, they arrived hot and the delivery girl had a smile on her face.  Everything was great, the only complaint I had was I asked for the pizza to be double cut, I was told by the guy who took the order he would make a special note and make sure they do it and of course it was not done.  That was the only disappointing part.  As a regular customer you would think they would want to make sure everything is the way you asked for it to be and it did not happen.

When you have a hungry group of people you want to order, have it delivered and go, you don't want to get the pizza and then have to stop and recut 3 pizza's that could and should have been cut very easily before delivery.

At least the attention to detail was put into making some great pizza's which we were all happy about.  The delivery driver was very friendly and represented this place with a professional attitude.  So now they have some new fans who now know they make awesome pizza's with great taste.  We will definitely order again and again but now know we need to have a pizza cutter on hand when the pizza's arrives."}
{"text":"Might be the best deep dish pizza I have ever had!  Atmosphere is awesome for a date or just some alone time! Also have free delivery if you choose. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious yummy greasy pizza! We ordered a New York style pizza half pepperoni and half cheese and cheesy garlic bread. Will come back and right by work"}
{"text":"I got delivery from here not to long ago!! Driver was so sweet and the pizza was great and wings too"}
{"text":"I used to think Pizza My Dear was amazing. It's lost some of its lustre. Not that it's bad. The pizza is still quite good.

Here's all you need to know. $5 lunch special for a one-topping 12\" pizza. I ate the whole thing in one sitting.

3.5 stars rounded up"}
{"text":"Need a quick pie and some garlic cheesy bread, this place is a decent spot if you're on this side of town.  15 minutes we got a supreme pizza and cheesy garlic bread for pick-up.  The pizza was pretty good, crispy crust and the meat was pretty tasty.  The cheesy garlic bread was even better, it's about the size of the supreme pizza and tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"Love this place awesome food friendly helpful people. Definitely recommend we order here almost every time we eat pizza."}
{"text":"Lady who answers the phones needs training in customer service. Stop playing dumb about your dinner specials.  The calls would be handled faster if you didn't pretend like you had no clue what you offer only to insist customers need to bring a coupon to honor the advertisement.  In reading previous reviews I'm not the first to experience her rudeness on Sunday nights."}
{"text":"I was excited when I found out PMD opened a second location on my side of town.  I had eaten at their original location but I am never on that side of town.  Pizza and salads are great.  Everything is made from scratch so food takes a bit longer than places that use pre-made pizzas and bagged salads but it is well worth the wait.  My wife likes traditional crust and I like their thin crust which works out great as we always have leftover pizza.  Prices are very reasonable and they always include plates and condiments which works out great when I order pizza for the office.  The only mediocre dish I have had are the baked raviolis and I think that is because I ordered them for the office and they were not piping hot by the time I got back to the office.  In fairness they may be good when eaten right out of the oven.  Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a really great pizza place, service was excellent, food came out super quick! It isn't pricy it's very well priced and they have a lot of great deals. It was so amazing I really do recommend and I'm from New Jersey so I know good pizza!!!b"}
{"text":"Love their pizza!  Every time I'm in Vegas it's a must have!!!  The pizza delivery time is perfect and always arrives hot!"}
{"text":"I give their Chicago stye pizza A+++++. So glad it is our neighborhood pizza parlor. The staff is very friendly and when they say it will be ready in 25 minutes, they mean it."}
{"text":"Got some pizza and salad last night. It was really good. The bbq chicken pizza was really good. We will be getting this pizza again"}
{"text":"Ordered a $20 deal that came with a large \"traditional\" pizza and 12 piece appetizer. Went with a pepperoni/sausage/mushroom pie and mozzarella sticks. Pizza was delicious, and the toppings were top-notch! Mozzarella sticks were alright, though the marinara sauce was exquisite. I should have went with the hostess' recommendation of wings or cheese bread for the app (next time!). This pizza connoisseur is pleased!"}
{"text":"A Great Menu, With A Pizza That Is A Really Great Tastte, With Quality Toppings! Free Delivery, and Pleasant Personal ."}
{"text":":( You have no idea the sadness that rips through my body when I take the first bite of a slice of pizza and it's not nearly as 'New York' as pizza places often advertise out here, not by a long, long shot. The crust is too thick and undercooked (apparently I can request it \"thin\" but I thought a thin crust was mandatory of NY pizzas); I think they did not leave the pizza in the oven long enough. The sauce tastes decent enough but there is WAY too much cheap mozz that turned out too dense and crumbly from being undermelted. 

If you want better NY style pizza please either go to Grimaldi's (thin and overpriced but better texture and flavor) or Enzo (also overpriced but the closest I've come to a good pizza out here)."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, I feel bad for the people saying this is the best pizza they have ever had. Got delivery, was on time but half cold.. It happens, I understand. However, the pizza was VERY dry and lacked any taste of freshness.. One of our toppings was garlic and I'm pretty sure it was garlic POWDER.. Jalapeño poppers were nothing special either. I try to support ma and pop places over chains but Grimaldi's is still the best pizza I've found in town in the past 3 years. Next.."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! It's definitely the best pizza place off the strip. They make their dough and sauce from scratch daily and boy can you taste the difference. 

Costumer service has been impeccable Every. Single. Time. 

Only tip is if you have time to eat up in store please do so if not delivery is fine BUT a hot bomb ass pizza is always best right out of the oven. Can't wait to come back!

Thank you for being in business we love you guys!"}
{"text":"Good but not great. Wall of pepperoni is about as much as you would expect on a normal order, it's certainly not double. Marinara sauce is a little tangy."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Everything I've had so far has been freakin' awesome, from their pizzas and appetizers to their salads and sandwiches.  To top it off, they always do little things too which make the most impact.  I ordered a salad and the put the dressing cups in a separate Ziploc bag with the food, just in case they spilled open.  And the salad was literally bursting out of the dish; they don't skimp on food.  Awesome place, you should definitely try at least once!"}
{"text":"I was sitting in my office as i do daily...Around 11am,, i start considering my lunch. LOL,,, I go thru all the choices with my co-workers... They wanted chinese i had to have a pizza... This place is close to the office and had a deal for  a 12 inch one topping pizza for 5bucks, during lunch...  I ordered the small cheese, it presented well, looked very good, the first bite.  EHHHHH... Dough was decent, sauce was ehhhh, cheese was ehhh..  Pizza was ehhhh...  It tasted like conveyor belt pizza, not the regular pizza oven that produces the crispy crust...  I think the pizza here is decent, not great not horrible...  I will try the sicilian next time, but the NY style is more Las Vegas style,, not that good...  Is there a place in town that makes a great memorable pizza ??  When i worked in Philly,, i would decide,, you know i need good pizza, hop on the train to NYC and have street pizza, then return to work, needless to say it was about 5 hrs later,, talk about a long lunch...  There isnt a place in Vegas that totally blows me away... Uncle Joes and Verrazano's are the closest to NY Style i have tried in the valley so far... Try it if you are in the area, your opinion may be different than mine.. Hope this YELPS..."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had here in Vegas.  The Chicago style pizza was very true to Chicago!!! I am now a loyal customer"}
{"text":"DiGiorno, my dear. Sorry, but need to call a spade a spade here. I had high expectations, hoping this could be my go-to neighborhood pizza joint, but the pizza was unremarkable tonight. It was an average pie, nothing to get super excited about. I actually toasted it a bit more when I got home and found it better. I'm also a sucker for a good chicken parm (please tell me where are they in Vegas?) but instead of ordering the $9.99 version here I thought I'd try the chicken finger appetizer to see if it warranted the price. Gotta say, I'm curious."}
{"text":"I love Pizza My Dear.

My last review was a couple years ago, and I've just grown to love them more as the years go by.  They're the go to Pizza Place for my team at work, and let me tell you...the Big Fat Greek pizza will change your life.  

Did you know that they have a rewards program?  Sign up! You get all kinds of cool coupons, and you get rewards...and you also get a free 8\" cheese pizza for your birthday!  You can't top that!!

Today, I actually went in to the shop to pick up the pizza, and the staff was super nice.  

Now...PLEASE open a location near Nellis AFB!!!  I need good pizza near home."}
{"text":"I had been a Big Fan of Pizza My Dear, since their Warm Springs location. When Freeman was at the Old Building, we would buy PMD for our Pizza Parties. I've brought family who were visiting from out-of-town to the Warm Springs location and they Loved it! When I saw their new location at W Flamingo, needless to say I was overly excited! We tried this new location for the 1st time and sadly our two pizzas, a Salami, Mushroom, & Sausage and a Sausage Pizza just didn't taste good at all. When I asked my wife to order the Californian, she had ordered hella fast, so I didn't get a chance to sample their signature pizza. But I've tried many of their signatures and custom ordered pizzas from the Warm Springs location, but our pizza tasted nothing like PMD that I am familiar with. I will try to make another go at it and my review will be updated, positive or negative, we'll just have to see."}
{"text":"This place is close to work, so we order from here a lot. I've had their veggie, Mediterranean, lasagna, and pepperoni pizzas, and they've all been good. I would recommend always picking up or having your order delivered. I think there's only two tables in the place, and not much air conditioning."}
{"text":"I received their menu flyer in the mail at work and was totally impressed with the quality of the graphic design and layout. (It wasn't just some printed paper flyer) I mentally visualized this was a semi-fancy pizza joint with decent pricing.

Just browsing their menu option, it had me crave for a meatball sub. So I decide I might as well check it out.

I was a little surprised to find out it was a little mom n pop shop with a small dining area that could only accommodate 3 parties. But, I absolutely LOVE little hole in the wall places because a majority of the time, the food is delicious. 

They seemed extremely busy with phone orders. Only one other couple occupied a booth; and I decided to dine in as well. I was a little weary because I was a walk in and didn't phone in an order, but the wait was not bad at all. 

I was impressed with their meatball sub. It was made a little different than what I am used to, but was quite tasty. The bread was fresh and toasty. They didn't skim out on the cheese, and the size was well worth the price.

Personally, I was impressed with the quality and pricing. The mom n pop shop ambiance fits the profile. I am excited to come back and try out more on their menu.

I would recommend this place any 9-5 worker who wants to make the most out of their 1 hr lunch break :)"}
{"text":"Just picked up our Hawaii 5-0 and Cheesy garlic bread...I couldn't wait to say this needs more than 4 stars. 5 stars because of the cheese."}
{"text":"Well after ordering from pizza my dear five times now, I can say they are my FAVORITE in town. Seriously amazing. The service is great, prices are really good for the quality and taste of the pizza!

The only eh thing about this place is that the delivery time is a little long, usually about an hour. But it's not too bad if you order with that in mind. 

Overall amazing! Will be ordering from them for years to come."}
{"text":"Love the food here used to go to there other location on the other side of town was so happy when I saw them opening one by my house these guys really know how to put the flavor in pizza."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood pizza place that delivers. Lots of quality ingredients at a great price. The specialty pizzas have fun names like The Godfather, Michelangelo and My Big Fat Greek Pizza. Not only do they offer both New York and Chicago style, they also have a gluten free option too! In addition to pizza, they also offer many other items such as salads, sandwiches and desserts including tiramisu. I also really like that they offer free cheese bread with the purchase of a pizza. 

When I called today they informed me of their new pizza points rewards program which of course I signed up for. They already sent me a $5 off coupon. Pretty smart!

I have ordered delivery from them many times and it has always been great and delivered in a reasonable amount of time with friendly service."}
{"text":"We were so impressed that we used them to cater our daughters rehearsal dinner.  Rave reviews.  Thanks.  
I think we order one every other week.  Great pizza and wings."}
{"text":"I liked it!

We had a lunch meeting at work and one of my tech guys suggested we pick food up from here.  We got 3 pizzas [one thin crust], 2 salads [which were HUGE] and chicken wings.  Food was ready when I got there and guy at the register was very nice!

We all liked our food and they made me a believer!  

I'm going back"}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza in town, and my delivery always takes about as long as you'd get elsewhere."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the pepperoni and supreme pizza. Those are the only two type my family and I eat. And this place is the best!!! Super yummy! A bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I am new to the Vegas area and kept searching for that 'perfect pizza place'. I finally found it here! The sauce is wonderful, the topping selection is great and the crust? Don't get me started! I also found their prices to be reasonable."}
{"text":"Pizza is not gluten free. REAL GLUTEN FREE has its own oven.  Used for GLUTEN FREE made food. You cannot cook gluten free in the some oven as normal dough . ITS A SCAM . But the hot wings were delicious & small & natural like."}
{"text":"Weve ordered from here several times after a fellow parent at our sons karate class recommended it. 
It is SO good. Always arrives quickly and the staff is always so incredibly nice. 
Recommend this little spot to EVERYONE! The size of the house salad is seriously enough for 4 people and one order from this spot leaves us with food for days!"}
{"text":"This pizza was very good and very fast delivery. I got a personal size and it was perfect for me! Though, if you are sharing with 2 people the large is plenty. 

Only side note: The dough could have been cooked a little more .

Besides that We will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Pizza my dear was once my go to for picking up pizzas for the family. I had not eaten there in at least a year and decided to Have pizza delivered along with dessert to my home. It did not go very well. They are always very nice, but the pizza wasn't as delicious as I recall. They also forgot to Deliver my desserts so I had to call and request them. They did ultimately end up bringing them twice and, because of the mistake,let me keep both deliveries.  I still love pizza my dear over other pizza restaurants, but the next time I will just pick up my pizza so that I can ensure everything is intact."}
{"text":"I've order over 3 times and I never get disappointed the pizza is so fresh and tasty I can't get enough my biggest craving during this pregnancy and I wouldn't change it !"}
{"text":"Meh. Not terrible but not amazing. Didn't feel it was worth the price. Pizza toppings were sliding off, cheese everywhere, big mess. But flavor was good. Jalapeño poppers tasted like they were frozen then heated up real quick. Side salad had decent amount of toppings. The blue cheese dressing was warm though! Also they forgot the dessert we ordered and when the delivery guy came back (different than the first guy) he wasn't very pleasant and gave no apology. I think there's better pizza options."}
{"text":"Was craving for pizza and I wanted a change from my normal go to spot

Ordered a pepperoni sausage and mushroom pizza and chicken wings for carry out. 

Came by and the counter person was taking a large order for the next day. Unfortunately didn't acknowledge me and I ended up waiting. A delivery driver showed up and got my pizza but couldn't ring me as the other employee was using the system. I ended up just getting cash and putting it on the counter before I left. Took 12 min to pick up pizza. 

Once home both the wings and pizza were decent but nothing memorable for me. Hope you have better luck as the reviews have been really good and maybe I just got unlucky."}
{"text":"I ate from here 3 times in a 6 day stay. Great staff, excellent delivery and the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Good food. This place is more set up for take out or delivery. They only have 2 booths and 1 table. Very informal, very casual. In strip mall location. Service friendly and food was very good. It kinda scares you when you first approach it. It is nothing fancy, just pure plain. But the great food makes up for it. Their delivery drivers seemed real busy. They had lots of pick up business going on. Keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza and wings with very reasonable prices. We had 4 different pizzas because we wanted to try them all! My favorite was the pesto pizza with ricotta and extra cheese. This is going to be on our regular rotation now!"}
{"text":"Love this little spot! Hands the the best pizza in town. I've been ordering for about a year now from here. There Chicago pizza is so good, There wings are great! 100% recommended."}
{"text":"Pizza was ready in 20 minutes and was pretty tasty. A few options are available for sauces, including marinara, pesto, and white garlic. Chicken fingers were delicious, however, not happy that when we ordered them tossed in hot sauce that they came half covered in hot sauce. All side sauces come at a cost. There are lots of options for toppings."}
{"text":"The pizza is decent i ordered a large order for work meeting and the pizza was on time and hot. THEY DO NOT SERVE FRIES?!! chicken fingers (plain only).But not greasy. The order included 6 large pizzas and a 20 piece of chicken all for $121"}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza and friendly staff. Yes there is cheaper pizza out there but the price is really not bad and the pizza is yummy. glad they have a location on Flamingo so I could try."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian pizza ever!!! This place is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza for Las Vegas. Fast and free delivery with the yelp app. This has probably my go-to pizza delivery."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent! Delivery is impeccable! The owners are always friendly and helpful. Food is always hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Like this place a lot, its our new go- to pizza delivery joint. 
They have VERY decent gourmet pizza, and regular pizza. 
The garlic white sauce is the best!
The veggie pizzas are fresh and the toppings yummy, so far nothing I ordered from here was nasty old tasting or greasy. 

The fingers are really different, they seem baked not fried. Very airy and fluffy, lightly crusted, and packed in a  nice box. The wings are fantastic s well.. They seem to be baked too.

When they deliver they give you some paper plates and a cute little note.
They seem conscious of their food and service.
Thank you! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The best Pizza in town! 
Great customers service, staff is always friendly and free delivery. I highly recommend Pizza My Dear."}
{"text":"Well, it's been just about a year that we've been in this neighborhood and we've ordered from Pizza My Dear many, MANY times.  It has become my favorite pizza in Las Vegas.  I'm from Chicago and my husband is from Massachusetts so we know good pizza.  It is simply THE BEST!!!!  Keep up the great work....you deserve all the 5 Star Ratings."}
{"text":"Great pizza and mozzarella sticks. Definitely one of the better pizza places I have tried in Vegas."}
{"text":"Holy moly!

We almost made the mistake of almost going to Rocco's (Literally walked inside and left after seeing pictures of this place) 

The taste is close to NY pizza. Very rich flavor. 

They offer personal pizzas, Chicago Style (Deep Dish) and traditional. 

There are only two large tables. Most people order take out. This place gets busy so be prepared to wait awhile."}
{"text":"this is some good stuff. ive been eating pizza my dear for years now i havent had a yelp account till today but now that i do this is the key to some of the best homemade pizza in vegas. no fancy gimmicks or spoofs just a great family owned business thats made it for 10+ years with excellent delivery service you have no other option but to give one of their specialty pizza like bbq chicken or try the white garlic suace instead of the marinara. they also make these really good chi town style deep dish pizzas stuff with toppings. just about everything you could ask from you local pizza guy. i wish i didnt move across town im thinkin about offerin the delivery guy a huge tip to drive some pizza out this way next time i need delivery (i highly regret my last pizza delivery from the worst pizza shop in vegas 8th ave pizza in southern highlands eww )  
Anyway, if your lookin on here wondering if this pizza is good i say its GREATTTT!!! ask em about their specials they always have some kinda good deal for ya"}
{"text":"SIMPLY THE BEST!!!

The pizza that I received was AWESOME! The dough was cooked perfectly, and although it was quite dense (perfect!), every bite was fluffy and VERY much flavorful!  To my absolute surprise and delight, the toppings were plentiful and delicious (the bacon and pepperoni were AMAZING!!!).  I requested that the pizza be cooked well-done, and my request was honored :) I ordered the 12\" Chicago Style pizza (it comes w/ 4 free toppings, and the toppings are many and premium), and after eating three generous sized slices (my sis had a slice, also), there were still slices to refrigerate :) I was also pleasantly surprised to see that a small container held a side of marinara sauce, one that was certainly welcomed, but had not been requested :) 

I didn't order through Yelp but used a different platform that gave me free delivery w/ the purchase of $15+ and w/ the price of the pizza ($15.49 + tax and tip), that threshold was easily met.  I, initially, raised an eyebrow at the hefty cost of the pie, but after first sight and first bite...I UNDERSTOOD!!!

BRAVO to you, Pizza My Dear!!! I will DEFINITELY be ordering again in the future, so I can have my ENCORE experience :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  The pizzas are good.  The sauces are above average, while the crust is average.  My kids adore the chicken fingers.  Online ordering is very surprising, coming from a little place like this."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Pizza My Dear. A little dark but very nice inside. I ordered (Carry out, 25 minutes) a pepperoni and cheese pizza with chicken wings, for the side of my family that still eats meat! Haha and they said it was very good, as for me and my wife I ordered a vegetarian pizza, with no black olive. It was very flavorful, lots of different flavor going on there. With their \"signature mozzarella sauce topped with mushrooms bell peppers onions and fresh tomatoes\".  I should've ordered extra mushrooms (that's my meat substitute). Overall I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Please don't get this location confused with the Henderson location.  There has been a change in ownership at the Summerlin location.  I placed an order for seven people at 11:45 am. My order arrived after 2 hours.  I called several times about the order, and all I got was, either he's on his way or I just spoke to him he's a block away.  He finally arrived with cold food, I called the manager while the delivery guy was here and let him know that he had just arrived and the order is cold.  He said to keep it, and I'll give you a credit.  I called today to use the credit, and was offered credit for only one of the orders. I asked for the manager that I had spoken to last week and was told he no longer worked there.  How's that for costumer service?  FAIL!"}
{"text":"Me and  my family are on vacation and we wanted a good delivery pizza spot. What do you know we found one! We ordered the Surf&turf pizza!REALLY GOOD! The salad was absolutely delicious and the wings were good. They have good customer service over the phone!"}
{"text":"Everyone seems to have a good experience, we must had a bad night. We ordered a pizza for carry on and the pizza generally was undercook"}
{"text":"Yes they did give me a credit to come back in and get a pizza on the house..it was still horrible..it was soggy..don de marcos is probably the best pizza in town..honestly little ceasers was better then this"}
