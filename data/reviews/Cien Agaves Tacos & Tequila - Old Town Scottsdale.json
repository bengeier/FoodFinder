{"text":"Prickly pear margarita and cheese dip were great. Potato and cheese tacos on kids menu were really good but we got the quesadilla on kids menu and they were really greasy"}
{"text":"First time to Scottsdale and a friend took us to Cien Agaves. Loved the location!  Perfect for shopping and then dinner and drinks. We started with the margaritas and I have to say they were about the best I've ever had. Definitely enjoyed the cucumber one, very refreshing! For those who can tolerate spicy, I also loved the Habanero margarita. For an appetizer don't miss the cerviche. All the food was delicious and good size portions. Leave room for dessert because the flan was the best I've ever had.  Service was personable and attentive while laid back. This place is a definite thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came in at 330 on a Tuesday.  I assume this was their slow time as there was only a handful of patrons and at least 3 or 4 servers and 1 bartender. 3 female servers walked right by me without saying hello or acknowledging me. I hate that.  Makes you feel like they don't want you there. After 5 minutes a gentleman approached and asked if I had been helped. He took a drink order and returned with a menu. Nice guy but he had a dirty broom and dustpan in has hands the whole time....not very appetizing.  A few minutes later, the bartender took my order. I had the Tingo tacos. Tacos were very good as were the chips and salsa. They bring 2 salsas, red and green and both were very good. I really appreciate it when the person taking care of me comes back to see how my food tastes, promptly.  The female bartender did come back to my table but after I was halfway through. If I had had a problem she would have never known it. I asked for a to go box and she brought me one. As I was packing my food in the box I dropped a chip. I didn't feel like getting down at the moment to pick it up and I watched as all of the female servers walked by, more than once and never picked the chip up. Two mail servers did the same thing. There's no way they didn't notice it. It was right in the middle of the walkway and they just stared at it and did nothing. You can always tell when people don't like their job and that's the impression I got from this restaurant. None of the staff smiled at me and none of them seemed like they cared that I was there at all.  It's too bad, the food was very good. When I come to a restaurant I don't expect people to do cartwheels and shoot off fireworks when I come in. However I do expect to be greeted and treated with kindness and a smile. These people all walked around with frowns on their faces and with the attitude that they just didn't care."}
{"text":"If they serve tacos and margaritas in heaven, they'll probably be like the tacos here, delicious! The Al Pastor tacos are about as close to authentic as you'll get this side of the border. Great friendly bartender too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best happy hour deals in the area. Great food and great drinks. Had the new and improved tinga taquitos on my last visit! It's my new fav! Happy to see they stay busy during the summer..."}
{"text":"Have had lunch here twice and take out once and each time the experience has been great. The sangria is delicious and the ahi tacos are my favorite. The chicken fajitas are wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Love this place for tacos and drinks. They have the BEST margaritas you will ever have not to mention their shrimp and fish tacos as AMAZING! I like to sit outside on the patio. It reminds me a bit of Europe or NY or something."}
{"text":"Food was decent but not consistent. One lobster taco was cooked perfectly and the other was like rubber. I did enjoy the flavors, though, and the presentation was okay.  Still, two stars because neither my dinner-mate or I actually ordered a lobster taco at all. I knew we were in trouble when the server didn't write anything down and we both had a three taco combo. Talking to said waiter/bartender was impossible because he was in such a hurry and it was so loud anyway. I tried to catch his attention once as he ran by but that didn't work out...  So we ate what we got.  Why were we seated in the bar, you ask? We made a dinner reservation online at Cien Agaves' website but something was wrong with the system that day. Not sure if that was a technical or human fault but whatever. The only option was outside... At the end of June... Or in the bar. I actually saw another couple go spend some time outside and then leave, fanning themselves.  I'd like to try some of the other offerings but that's not likely to happen until it looks like they get their systems sorted out. That includes order taking, reservation taking, and uniform cooking.  Will check back in the future to see what other people have to say."}
{"text":"love this place.. ya they do tinga!  go with a group and order a bunch of tacos.. I order my tinga tacos in a non crisp shell / instead a basic corn tortilla... good cocktails, 4 stars only because I think they run a pretty lean labor and leads to, not offensive, yet dragged out service sequence.  I have never left unhappy... been there 5 times now.  Yes it is old town, and it is really good, just don't bookend yourself with an appointment after your meal and it will be perfect."}
{"text":"solid tacos i love coming here on taco Tuesday for taco deals.  Great hard beef tacos for cheap"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good and our server (who was also bartending) was very attentive and nice. They have an amazing selection of tequilas, and the margarita that my mother had almost killed her (in a good way). I would def. go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cien Agaves many times after work - always with excellent service. Usually I sit at the bar, but I recently had the pleasure of being served by Mimi when out with some friends. Mimi was especially courteous, checking up on us many times to make sure we were all set. She had a great sense of humor, too. 5 Stars for Mimi!!  The happy hour deals are decent. Personally, I think it should be extended to more than just the house margarita.  As a tip, the avocado margartia is to die for! It sounds weird, but it's creamy and delicious. I think it milds the flavor of the margarita a bit, which is nice."}
{"text":"Came tonight with some friends and got seated pretty quick, considering it was pretty busy. Service was decent and the food came out on time and correct. Water tasted unfiltered though, like tap on ice. Not so refreshing. Note for service staff, I'm in the biz too and understand it's busy for this smaller sized restaurant but slow down a little bit. Watched a girl run full sprint like a NFL try out into the kitchen through the double doors and could have done some real damage to herself or someone else. Remember, your on stage at all times and ppl are watching you. Tacos fiesta!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas!!!  We came here during happy hour for a margarita (or two).  Their service was excellent and margaritas very tasty.  They have some interesting decor and nice window view of shoppers.  We tried a beer-rita, our first and were big fans!"}
{"text":"Love this place! there last night had to delicious tacos Tinga should beef very good!"}
{"text":"I have  found another great place to eat when visiting my daughter in Phoenix.  I went there with my wife and two of my 3 daughters  and was surprised  with the quality of tacos.  We ordered 5 different  meat tacos and were  all delicious.   We had queso  verde with cold beers  and tasty margaritas  while we waited for our food.  I highly recommend  it to anyone who asks."}
{"text":"It's a fun place and gets pretty crowded and loud. The food is okay, not the best Mexican you can get in AZ but it is a good location and decent enough. higher prices and the service is not good."}
{"text":"Tacos and Tequila- A match definitely made in heaven... and if heaven's a place on earth, then it's here at Cien Agaves!  !Tabernero, más Clase Azul y tacos de papa por favor¡"}
{"text":"they have great Mexican food! always come here when we visit for spring training. the margaritas are the best! they have many flavors and even more tequila options. super good!"}
{"text":"This is when you wish Yelp had a 0 star option.  On the surface, this restaurant has 3-star appeal. My husband and I were excited to enjoy a well-crafted margarita with some upscale tacos, and we left satisfied with our experience. Yet, when my husband wound up with an awful bout of food poisoning that kept him in bed for the entire next day, we instantly regretted our experience.  Being on vacation, this wound up costing us expensive tickets to two spring training games and time with our friends that we hadn't seen in years. When I called the restaurant to alert them of the issue in their kitchen, the manager was rude and accusatorial.   The manager said it was impossible that the food poisoning came from them, because it takes 24 hours for food poisoning to occur. When I mentioned that the Mayo Clinic disagrees and that it only takes hours, she went as far as arguing the Mayo Clinic's research.  She said that the restaurant requires customers to get a doctor's note verifying that the food poisoning came from their food. Well, since it was 7:00 on a Friday night and we were trying to salvage what was left of our shortened vacation, we weren't trying to pay $500 for an unnecessary ER visit.   Food poisoning is bad, yet Cien Agaves' customer service is worse."}
{"text":"Kenzie was amazing, hot too! Just like the tacos! Great experience, service was amazing. I'll be back on Tuesdays for sure. Good beer, good food, and good service. It doesn't get better that."}
{"text":"Great happy hour... Food and drink specials very well priced. And tastes fantastic! We had guac and tacos...awesome"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I only ever write really good or really bad reviews. The service at the bar tonight was so horrible we are having the rest of our party meet us elsewhere for dinner. I've eaten here several times but this has left such a bad taste in my mouth I doubt we will be back. We would've ordered another drink and had our party of 5 for dinner but since we got completely ignored after our first chip and drink order with only 5 people at the bar and waiting over 30 min to get her attention to get a check we will be going elsewhere. Yes she checked on us to put in our order and an hour later gave us a check."}
{"text":"Great tacos, especially the carne asada.  Took advantage of the happy hour specials, half off.  Great atmosphere, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place! The food and the strawberry mojitos were fantastic! The service was good and it was great atmosphere.YUM!"}
{"text":"I work next door to cien agaves and I absolutely love this place! Awesome food and they have the best chips in salsa around! The staff is very nice and helpful as well, Jaime the manager and Danielle the bar tender are so nice they are like family and always keep me coming back! This place is a must have if your in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  I am really not trying to bash Cien Agaves, but I do hope this review will be looked at by the establishment and make improvements.  I attended the tequila tasting last night and decided to eat here.  I'll give a pass on the drinks. The service and food were NOT good.  Our waiter/server was not attentive as he should have been.  The place was not busy and there was not clear reason for the lack of service.  He practically snatched the menu out of my boyfriend's hands.  I ordered the Chile Relleno with rice and beans. The beans tasted like they were from a can. The rice was dry and flavorless.  The chile relleno was not fresh. My boyfriend ordered tacos and the tortillas were cold, not impressed."}
{"text":"I love the taco Tuesday! 1.50 tacos and the salsa is the best in town I prefer the read but the green is good to. The beer could be colder but it a great place to watch the game an eat some great 1.50 tacos! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Came here with my family (including a 3 week old child) not really knowing what to expect. It was a fantastic restaurant. Food was exemplary. I highly recommend the chicken fajitas it was insane. Family enjoyed it. Good ambiance in the restaurant and really nice outdoor seating. 5/5 would recommend. And yo... fajitas...get them"}
{"text":"Wow that is what i call a carne asada taco, plus i had my first $3 marg that you can actually taste the tequila in. Wow! Chips where nice and hot had to salt then of course so i can drink faster. Salsa was good, did not like the green one though, red one had plenty of flavor asked for the hot sauce to heat it up. The Carne Asada was actually real steak. Nice! will be back for sure, rumor has it the have taco specials tomorrow too."}
{"text":"I ordered a bowl of soup to-go during my lunch break. The soup was recommended & I was excited to try it. The soup was nice. I have had better creamy poblano soup in San Diego. BUT this was wasn't bad. Only thing was I wish I had more of it. I ordered a 12oz bowl, and got 2 small, less than half filled containers of soup. I spoke with the Manager, Bob, he seemed distracted while speaking to me and almost like I was a bother. He said he would credit me a soup for next time. Thankfully the soup was good enough to go back and have again. Overall bad first impression, and mediocre customer service"}
{"text":"Beer is cold, tequila is good and guacamole is spicy ...and that's how Latin bar should be"}
{"text":"We happened to stumble upon this place while driving through Old Town Scottsdale. Best Mexican food we have ever had!!!! Hands down the best fajitas I have ever eaten!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with some friends.  Margaritas were good. Not as strong as I like but good...lol!!!  Chips and salsa is good.  Great flavor.  Asked for the habanero salsa....has a nice kick. Which I liked..  :).  Ordered the guacamole dip, Ono taco and a chorizo taco....it was all good!  No complaints.!!  Bartendar was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Fajitas!! We were obsessed with everything! Had the Organic Marg, Guacamole app, and shrimp fajitas!!! Husband had the Prickley Pear Marg, pretty looking and yummy as well! Was here a couple weeks ago and will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great service, great prices with a casual atmosphere in a superb location. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I frequent this place a lot.  Its a great Mexican restaurant in the middle of Old Town, where there is a daily happy hour deal.  I'm not a fan of tequila, but if you are, this place is a must visit.  They have it all...  As for the food, I enjoy the fish tacos, as well as the baja lobster tacos.  Absolutely delicious!  I always tell myself I'm just getting 2 tacos, but end up getting 3 or sometimes, even four!  The guacamole is pretty good here as well. It always seems to sneak its way on our table as well.    As for the service:  My fiance and I come here a lot, so we've had our share of good and bad servers.  Some are very friendly and are more than happy to please you, however, we've had a server or two who never checks up on you and takes 20 minutes to bring a beer even when its not busy.  Service is kind of hit-or-miss, but the food definitely makes up for it, and the prices are more than fair.  We've even used Cien Agaves to cater for a baby shower.  They allowed us to rent out the upstairs area.  It was out of the way and private, and the food was very satisfying.  They did a great job."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Tequila/Mexican restaurant in Phoenix! The staff is super cool and very attentive. The food is highly addictive, and they have a TON of Tequila. Bob and Rocky are great guys, they always say hello to everyone and make people feel genuinely welcomed. When I walk into Cien Agaves, I feel relaxed and calm. A true beautiful oasis in the desert! MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Cant give negative stars.  So got this walked in with a meal that followed my diet and was going to get drinks and they told me I had to eat my meal outside on the curb. Fail fail fail"}
{"text":"The service was poor at best. We were there for over 2 hours not because we were lingering. We had the tacos and they were nothing special, especially for the price. One of the tacos, the pork Al Pastor, had no sauce, was dry and had very little meat on it. I will not be back. I never give reviews in restaurants but felt strongly about this."}
{"text":"Great casual fare, nice atmosphere, amazing tequila selection. We were able to eat outside on the patio, which was fabulous. Would recommend this restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"Very weak margaritas. When I spend $12 for a drink I need to actually taste the tequila. I'm pretty disappointed that a place with tequila in its name can't make a good drink. Meh."}
{"text":"Our overall review based soley on today's dining experience is 3.5 stars. However, we have visited Cien Agaves probably a dozen times over the past year and those experiences average 4 stars. I think today was just a slightly \"off\" day for the kitchen.  To start, we visited during a very busy spring training game lunch, and the place was packed with a nice variety of tourists and locals alike. We were impressed that we were able to be seated quickly and got our drinks and order in before several large groups. The salsas and chips arrived rapidly after our request for them, and we were happy to have them to enjoy while we waited for our lunch. The green salsa was tart and tasty; the red salsa with a large pieces of onion and tomato (I love a chunky salsa) was even better. The chips were fresh and warm.  We had a very good waitress who kept our refills coming and did a great job keeping in touch with us throughout the course of our time at the restaurant. Like I said, this was very impressive service in spite of the crowd in the restaurant.   My hubby and I ordered our two favorite meals at Cien Agaves for lunch. He got the chorizo cheese crisp; I got the green chili pork soup. My soup was GREAT! It had wonderful tender chunks of pork, plus the vegetables were cooked perfectly to the way I like them, gently pliable but not mush. It also had the right amount of spice, just enough to make me sweat ever so slightly.  The problem with our meal occured with the cheese crisp. First, the amount of chorizo was stingy. Secondly, and more importantly, it was burned on the bottom to the point that is all we could taste was BURNT. When the waitress stopped by to check on us shortly after the meals were delivered, we explained this problem and she immediately sent this flawed cheese crisp packing, back to the kitchen.  Before too long, we were greeted with another crisp. The amount of chorizo was increased, which was good. This time, however, the crisp was slightly undercooked and slimy, making it more difficult to eat. On the other hand, the flavors this time, of the cheese and onions and sausage, came through nicely so we proceeded to eat this second cheese crisp even though it wasn't CRISP. Better than too CRISP, I guess.  All in all, I was sorry to give today's experience 3.5 stars instead of the 4 our meals usually deserve. But like I said, something was \"off\" in the kitchen today, which lowered the rating for us. However, it will not keep us from visiting Cien Agaves again."}
{"text":"Ate at Cien Agaves tonight with Three friends.  Each ordered something different and all of us tasted every meal.  We all loved all four meals.  It isn't just the food that was great   The margaritas were the best and the service equaled the food and drinks!!!  All four of us agreed that we'll be back at Cien Agaves often."}
{"text":"Very good fresh guacamole and fabulous margaritas. Service great and very friendly. Nicely located in Old Town Scottsdale.  Would definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food ever! Food is very fresh tasting. Guacamole and enchiladas are delish."}
{"text":"Today was definitely my last visit to Cien Agave. My son found a fly in his water! It was disgusting. A dead fly just floating there! The worst part was how it was handled. I informed the waitress, she appeared to be shocked and had no idea how it got there. She never apologized. I honestly dont think she meant to be rude, she sounded like she wasnt sure how to handle the situation.  I asked for the manager to express my concerns regarding cleanliness of the bar area. He seemed to preoccupied with the dinner rush coming in to address my concerns. He had one foot near my table and the other headed towards the incoming customers.  His lack of interest has most certainly lost my business and I will be sure to recant any positive recommendations I have made to friends, family, and coworkers."}
{"text":"Great food. Chimichanga can easily satisfy two people and two tacos is plenty for lunch. Great area of Old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Good veggie tacos, great happy hour.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"A casual and comfortable spot in Old Town with somebody in the kitchen who knows how to make Mexican food.....no doubt. Our server was a delight and right on target for keeping us happy, the salsa was great, especially the green one with tomatillos...loved it....and the tacos were good too. No, it's not \"quiet\" like your typical Scottsdale restaurant but I don't think it's meant to be. It's more like a restaurant/bar/cantina kind of place. Fun. No attitude here among patrons or servers. I loved it. Prices are very reasonable too. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Was in town for the day and dropped in for a drink. Great service, cute and friendly bar staff, owner was very personable, and fantastic margaritas. Can't wait to make it back there in a few months"}
{"text":"This place was the setting for two of my \"firsts\". My first fish taco and my first cucumber margarita and I was far from let down! Holy goodness they were so great. My husband and I had a weekend away from the kid so we decided to get some drinks and tacos. I've heard great things but it's always better to try it yourself! The Mahi Mahi taco was FABULOUS and their cucumber margarita is my new favorite, and I'm not usually a margarita fan!  We'll go back, for sure!"}
{"text":"NIce afterwork spot. Went here to watch the NBA finals. Great margaritas and had the seafood enchilada, which came out great. The servers were attentive as well. The crowd skews a little young for the area, but then again its old town Scottsdale, so there was the obligatory 50-year old playboy sprinkled with a spat or two retirees."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and just happened to pop in here. We had the tacos and they were great. The kids meal were great too. My margarita with chiles was amazing. We had GREAT service which is a big deal to us. The girls were great!  Would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Scottsdale and the lady at the Pendleton store recommended Cien Agaves for lunch.  We were not disappointed.  Great food, great service! Just a wonderful experience.  If you're in Scottsdale you should give it a try."}
{"text":"I've given this place so many fair shots because they have a great happy hour and seem like they have potential. The atmosphere is cool, the restaurant's decoration and patio are really neat, they have awesome artwork.   The reason I'm over it is because the service is pretty awful. The chips are stale, but they're free, so I'm not that critical and don't need to fill up on free chips anyway.  Girlfriend digs the margaritas because they don't taste as 'syrupy' (whatever that means) and because they are half price on happy hour. Tinga tacos ($1.50 each) are good too. We really prefer the other tacos they used to have on happy hour like 6 months ago...consider bringing those back, management.  The problem is really that most servers are clueless, irritated that you're in their section and get everything wrong. Pretty consistently, the waitresses seem to be in their first week of their first serving job - forgetting orders, messing stuff up and being awkward.  So if you have a lot of patience, are not in a rush and have a lot of great friends with you, this might be an okay choice for happy hour, but there are definitely a lot of better options nearby."}
{"text":"Three-hundred-fifty pennies...during HH...for the best margaritas in town...equals four stars!  The chips and salsa were so-so (but gratis thankfully) and the carne asada tacos were very good.  Little Lady had the vegetarian tacos (zuchinni, yuck!) which she enjoyed (did I mention they were filled with zuchinni? yuck!).  We didn't have full dinner service as this was just an afternoon pit stop, but I would love to return.  The patio is nice and tucked away on the side, and we had a great afternoon snack and cocktail.  If I can find a couple solid go-to dishes, this place promises to be my go-to Mexican spot in the 'dale--and the 'dale needs some good Mexican food desperately!"}
{"text":"It's called 100 Tequilas, it's gotta be worth a shot, right? I've been here more than a few times and was pleased each time. This place is kind of tucked away on one of the many side streets in Old Town Scottsdale but it's worth the trip.  I love that they have happy hour DAILY from 3p-7p. You can literally have a few margaritas ($3.50) and half price appetizers or ($1.50) tacos by yourself for about $25. I went there on a Sunday afternoon with 2 other ppl and we ordered about 7 appetizers, 9 margaritas, a dessert and coffee for a little over $60 and we were all full. All in all, the food was pretty decent as were the drinks. I'd come here again to just hang out with a few ppl, watch sports on the many TV's and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"I was there today for the first time. It was very unimpressive. I ordered a chicken taco that had about 3 bites of chicken in it plus some filler items and it was about half full. This item was $4.25. I could have made a dozen for that price and my 9 year old granddaughter could have done a better job. They seemed to cater to those who were drinking-not so much to us. The tortilla I had was cold and had not been warmed. They asked and I told them how I felt. Wow a whopping 10% off of our tab. I was underwhelmed. Not going back."}
{"text":"Had a really good meal. Loved the variety of fish tacos and they had a lot of vegetarian options too"}
{"text":"Highly recommend if you love guacamole and carnitas! The prickly pear margarita was also delicious! Service, ambiance and food are all top notch!"}
{"text":"Wow, I really fell in love with Cien Agave because of their awesome selection of exotic Mexican veg options!  I can usually find a few vegetarian items at most restaurants but they're usually just OK.  What I had at this place was phenomenal!  For example their Pappas Con Queso (seasoned potatoes and cheese) and their grilled veggie tacos were can you say mouthwateringly awesome?! Also, they have the most deliciously fresh and exotic salad dressing made of a prickly pear vinaigrette.  But, my fave of all was their creamy poblano soup, was just the perfect amount of spicy mixed with creamy that has your mouth saying \"ahhhh\" and \"mmmmm\" after each spoonful.  Looking forward to trying some of their other tasty food creations and drinks at my fabulously new food crush place!"}
{"text":"Yummy spot for lunch in Scottsdale.  We were looking for something cheap and small for lunch while strolling Old Town.  They have a great taco selection for a bar and everything tasted delicious.  Prices were fine, and you could also order tacos ala carte."}
{"text":"My husband and I just happened to come across this place one Tuesday afternoon. Lucky for us it was Taco Tuesday! $1.50 shredded beef tacos all day. They were AWESOME! The crispy corn shell was the best I've ever had. We put on a little chalula sauce and it was perfection.  The margaritas are pretty good too. I like how they make the sweet and sour mix and use fresh lime juice.  We sat outside and we really enjoyed the atmosphere, laid back and casual. We had our dog with us and it was a good time.  Only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 is because the waiter knew it was our first time there and he didn't ask us if we wanted the complimentary chips and salsa. I only found out after coming on yelp that we had to ask for it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love CA.....but have a problem w staff that has an attitude especially Bartenders! This issue has surfaced quite a bit lately and overlooking it has become more difficult.  Hopefully mgmt. can see an opportunity to heighten the experience by finding people who enjoy their job BAR TENDING!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here while we walked around old town one day they were visiting. I didn't know this existed, until we passed by and looked it up on Yelp mobile on my sister's phone. We saw it's reviews, and decided to give it a shot.  It was busy downstairs, and but slow upstairs where we were. At first we had trouble getting water refills and chip refills, but I'll give it to the servers, it got packed quick upstairs (I think the Giant's spring training game got rained out). They eventually took a good chunk off of our bill, which was cool.  As far as food goes, we all ordered the different taco assortments. Mine were fantastic! A shredded beef taco, carne asada, and a fish. It was the perfect amount of food. We were all happy with our food.  Although this place is a tad on the divy side (no problem to me...dives are not necessarily bad), the food was great! I'd like to try some of their tequilas some day....I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is my GO TO for margaritas and happy hour! When I first moved here I searched forever for a great margarita happy hour, and I finally found it in Cien Agaves.  Happy hour goes until 7:00PM every day! Which is amazing for when I work late but still want to grab a drink.   The margaritas are amaze. My favorite is the prickly pear, hands down. The food is also pretty bomb as well. All apps are half off on happy hour, the tinga tacos (my fave) are also $2.   You can't go wrong with Cien Agaves!"}
{"text":"Came in on Easter Sunday for my first visit in. They are having a brunch special for Easter and it was yummy.  There are four different breakfasts today only but my friends also ordered off the regular menu. Must have a BeerRita which is a margarita w a coronito in it. Highly recommend you give this place a shot. Atmosphere is real Mexican and not easy to find in Old Town. Try HH it's 7 days a week and runs until 7. Check out the couple pics."}
{"text":"Great Old Town staple with high quality food and the best tequila list in town."}
{"text":"This place was great! Located in an older downtown area of Scottsdale, it was the perfect place to eat. We were able to sit outside and enjoy some warm weather with our margaritas! They had great guac, and chips and salsa. We both enjoyed our potato tacos!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't great.  Tacos were just okay and we had SPOILED guacamole. It was rancid. Gross!     Not sure what all the hype is about.   This place is a bar too, more of a club/bar rather than a restaurant where you want to go to enjoy a meal.    I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Excellent.  So much to say...we were in the area for three days and found ourselves at Cien Agaves twice, wishing for more.  Loved the Prickly Pear Margarita and the shrimp tacos and carne asada tacos the first day.  Went back for Happy Hour today. Usually happy hour drinks are pretty weak, but they kept high standards and served a delicious house margarita. And the guacamole with pomegranate seeds...yum.  Thank you Leon and Jeff for the great service."}
{"text":"You can't beat Taco Tuesday's at Cien Agaves! My family and friends have made it a weekly ritual and we can hardly go the entire week without craving those crunchy, beef tacos! At $1 each, I order two, with a side of black or refried beans and I'm all set. They serve complimentary chips with two salsas--tomato fresca and spicy tomatillo (my personal favorite). Last night we tried the Street Corn for the first time. It comes topped with a smokey chili blend, crumbled cotija cheese and with the full-husk to use as a handle. It's just a bit spicy, full of flavor and highly recommended (and just fun to eat)! There are also $2 Tecates so you can have a few with your meal and still come out paying only about 10 bucks. Really?? The restaurant is always hoppin' with happy people of all ages. It's well worth the trip, and maybe it will become a Tuesday ritual of yours too!"}
{"text":"Got to table waited 15 min. No menu, no I'll be right with you. Poor service and not enough employees to handle the amount of people they let in. We left as we were disappointed"}
{"text":"My server was pretty dope. She wore some nice crocs. It's always a good day when someone older than 3 wears a good pair of black crocs. I drank a lot of good, cold Dr. Pepper. Be warned Dr. Pepper is not a real doctor. One point of contention though, the green salsa is not as good as the red. Even if you put 2 packets of sugar in the green salsa it is still not as good. I would recommend this restaurant to various others."}
{"text":"Their salsa is either really tasty or I was just really hungry when I came here for lunch (the traditional tomato salsa, not the green tomatillo salsa, which is kind of blah tasting).  Had the Ono taco and the ahi taco.  The Ono was quite good, the ahi looked like it had seen better days.  Prices are reasonable, but service was slow."}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner here last Friday and everything was amazing! We had an entire upstairs area to ourselves! The bartenders were great! The food and Margaritas were awesome!"}
{"text":"My friend from Ohio came to visit and we randomly stopped here for drinks one afternoon. SO happy we came across this place because WOW this place is tasty! Their banana coladas are to die for. Best tacos: island shrimp taco and tecate fish taco. Servers were very nice and attentive...went back the next week and had the same great service! Wanted to go to tequila tasting (last Thursday of every month) but had to work the next morning!"}
{"text":"Great pitchers of margaritas and the patio is excellent. Kyle is a spectacular individual, as are the bartenders. Great place for drinks and appetizers, definitely try the guacamole, it has pomegranate seeds, so you won't be disappointed (unless those aren't your jam)."}
{"text":"Great taco and burrito our  bartender was  Casey very good service a must stop when in old town Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Food is OKay.  I had the burrito, but should have gotten the tacos.  The tequila selection is amazing!  Owners and staff very knowledge.  They even have their own hand selected herradura \"double barrel\" reposado.  Keep up the good work Rocky."}
{"text":"wonderful flavors in the meat and fish tacos  , well seasoned  - a winner we will be back. plus great service"}
{"text":"Great place for grabbing a taco in the center of old town. Cool art on the walls, not very expensive and figgen bangin tacos. I've had about 5 different ones and was not dissapointed in any- including the seafood ones which the majority were. Impressive, since we are no where near an ocean and the fish was grilled. I hear the margaritas are weak, which may or may not be a good thing depending. Would totally recommend it, especially since its next to one of my favorite bars, Patty's pub."}
{"text":"This was my first stop in Old Town. I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  Three resultant was quaint and well appointed.   The staff was really friendly.    The pork salsa verde was amazing.     100 tequilas oh yeah.   Got there in time for happy hour.   Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I were here a couple of weeks ago.  It was 8:00pm on a Friday night and the place was pretty empty, maybe two or three tables were occupied.    We were there with another couple and ordered several margaritas, their combination platter and a side of guajillo mashed potatoes.  We ordered several different tacos, but the ones I was interested were the Camarones a la Diabla and the Fresh Lobster tacos.  The shrimp was WAY too spicy to enjoy.  I like a lot of heat in my food, but not when it overwhelms everything else.  On the other hand, the lobster and jimaca was bland and lackluster.  I would have to say their selection of tequilas are nice.  I had their Cucumber Margarita and it was very cool and refreshing.  We may come back if I get a hankering for margaritas, if nothing else.  Also, I thought we would be in for an inexpensive night, but I guess with the combo platter, four margaritas and a couple of beers, it came out to be just over $80 a couple."}
{"text":"Food was good.  However, the manager is giving a job interview inside the restaurant and she is so loud that I can barely hear myself think.  It's pretty unprofessional to hold an interview in the middle of the restaurant during lunch hour.   It would be very easy to walk outside or hold at a different venue."}
{"text":"Four stars because I've only been here once and I've become a bit careful with the doling out of stars.  That said, my husband, mom-in-law and I had lunch here last week and we thought the tacos and the margaritas were spot on!   I lived in Phoenix some 20+ years ago and the *good* Mexican restaurants in Phoenix became my benchmark for Mexican food.  Granted, all we ate here (at Cien Agaves) were the tacos, rice and beans but, it's surprising how easy it is to mess up a taco.  I sampled the grilled ono, shredded beef and I think the carne asado taco.  All were good but my favorite was the shredded beef... I had a moment with that one.. (picture the scene in Disney's Ratatouille when the food critic samples Remy's ratatatouille).  I was transported to 1986. The margaritas we had deserve their own paragraph.  They use fresh ingredients and it shows!  One look at the first page of the menu and you know THEY know their tequila.  Find out when happy hour is as we learned you can get some very good deals."}
{"text":"We went to this Mexican establishment last Sunday night and we ordered the organic margaritas and we could taste any tequila and they put so much soda water in this drink it tasted like a soda. I ordered the taco combo, one ahi taco which was good however the crispy chicken taco was very bland and tasteless. The rice tasted old and you can tell they put it on the grill to reheat because it had burnt patches ...yuk! Over all I wouldn't spend the $$ to eat here again."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best thing about this place so far, because originally the prices are  a little high.  My husband had the big ass burrito and for $10 it was really small and full of a lot of rice.  We've also seen bigger burritos at say, Chipotle even.   The quesedillas are good, but they're a bit too greasy, and the chicken is that shreddy texture that I don't really like.    I'd go back but for happy hour only, even though there's only one mixed drink that's half off and only appetizers are half off."}
{"text":"What do I love about Cien Agaves?  What don't I love about Cien Agaves?!  Consistently, some of the best margaritas I've ever had.  The option for corn tortillas, instead of flour, on my tacos.  The perfect black beans...seriously, how do they get them to taste so good?   Service is usually good, I'd say 90% of the time it's great.    What can I really complain about?  Well, the floor is a little difficult to navigate in heels; it always seems slippery for some reason. (I'm actually surprised I haven't fallen down  yet.)  And the bathrooms.....they have black fixtures.  I know it's weird, but black bathroom fixtures give me the heebies.  Neither one is enough to keep me from returning on a regular basis.    I've been hesitant to write this review, only because I don't want to see you all there taking up my space and making me wait for a table.  I'm an impatient girl when it comes to my tequila.  ;)"}
{"text":"AmaZing habanero margarita and food. Still dreaming about how rich the chile sauce was days later."}
{"text":"Me and my wife came all the way out from CA to see old town Flagstaff. The service was poor, and the food was mediocre. I was hoping for some authentic tex-mex food but the food is very bland. The margaritas we ordered were mainly just mixer and lime, and we only saw out waitress 2-3 times. Avoid if you're looking for a good experience and great food"}
{"text":"fun place to go and grab a drink and bite to eat, again not your typical scottsdale crowd which I love.  I especially enjoy their tortilla soup and a beef taco on taco tuesday...totally reasonable and fun spot at night. See you tomorrow cien agaves for $2 taco's :)"}
{"text":"We had great service and even though the food might not necessarily be authentic Mexican, the dishes are light/fresh yet also filling.   The ceviche appetizer is no more than OK, but the tacos are delicious and super flavorful.  Good outdoor ambience, real cute too."}
{"text":"After a night of heavy drinking and regrets, I awoke to the bedside clock reading 4:00 PM. The previous nights events vaguely present in my memory like a faintly visible lighthouse from a sea bound schooner on a cold and foggy morning. I was desperately in need of a beverage and food to soften the impact the previous night's events had on my body and soul. It was Michal Ann who first greeted me upon entering the comfortable and welcoming establishment. Candy skulls and vibrant colors adorn the walls of the tequila bar which many have said is the only place Chuck Norris will sip his favorite Mezcal. After being served my favorite beverage, made to perfection by the legendary Michal Ann, I was quickly served some of the best tacos I've had north of Oaxaca by Alison, who placed them in front of me with a smile and friendly greeting which made me feel right at home. After I drank away my sorrows and ate enough food to calm stomach, I enjoyed the culturally unique and soothing music which plays daily at the best taco&tequila bar in the southwest. On the way out I completed my ritual of grabbing a toothpick and throwing \"deuces\" to the staff. Until next time Cien Agaves. Until next time..."}
{"text":"Cien Agaves is my \"go to Mexican.\" The prices are great. I love their ahi salad, vegetable fajitas (ask for light oil on the veggies), and the tacos. There are so many choices of tacos. Another must have is a margarita. I have yet to try one that I don't like. The cucumber is amazing, especially on a summer day. I have always had quick and good service here."}
{"text":"Had the best guacamole with pomegranate seeds today. Also had a fabulous salad with the freshest greens, avocado slices and delicious shrimp. The waitress recommended a great cilantro dressing to top it off and was very attentive to our needs. I also enjoyed a tasty Banana Colada that hit the spot!  Excellent to find a wonderful place to relax  and enjoy yourself when you are gone from home working. Actually plan on going back tomorrow night before this trip is over!"}
{"text":"Extremely dissatisfied I would give 0 stars if possible had issues with flat sodas burnt food dry chicken cold beans etc very upset with how we were treated.We addressed it with server who said she would bring a manager that never showed up and we had a party of six! Poor service crap food would not recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"We go here for dinner about 1-2 times a month and decided to have our wedding rehearsal dinner here a couple weeks ago.  There were about 30 of us.  We were impressed, and didn't expect everything to run as smoothly as it did.  Not only was the food fantastic, but the service was exceptional.  Amanda took great care of us, she knew exactly when drinks and food needed to be refilled without reminders.  The tinga tacos were delicious and the chocolate churro tower was amazing!"}
{"text":"We made reservations through Open Table and received a call from the restaurant to confirm on the morning of our reservation. We requested to be sat at the fire pit out on the patio. It was a very pleasant night and quiet outside. Indoors is a lot louder. The fire pit was not functioning but they placed a space heater near us and it was perfect. The appetizers were very good. We had the guacamole with chips, the green chile pork queso with chips and the chicken quesadilla. All appetizers were half price until 7 PM. Everyone enjoyed the tacos, salsas, chips, enchiladas, margaritas etc. The only food item that was subpar were the retried beans. The black beans are a better choice. The shrimp tacos and tecate tacos were probably the best items. Good food and atmosphere. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great time, good food...perfect combo!  Went for happy hour and had half price house margaritas and half price apps.  Had the best salad which was delicious!!"}
{"text":"The food was good my first time at this place and I was so hungry ate all of my food but the service was not satisfying. A better attitude from the workers will be good."}
{"text":"Ok, so I understand that there are others that don't agree with this rating, but I think this place is amazing!!!!  I have been here several times and their taco's are delicious.  On top of that, they have great appetizers and margaritas.  Hit this place up during happy hour and try the guac and ceviche.   Let's not forget the best item at Cien Agave which is their habanero margarita.  Absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. My favorite in old town. Their Chipotle Chicken Quesadilla is AMAZING! The best happy hour in the area and a great atmosphere. I had my birthday here as well and they accommodated for all 30 of my friends on the second floor!"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food and Margaritas.  We had our rehearsal dinner here and they were very accommodating.  The only issue was that we ran out of food and it took a long time to replace it."}
{"text":"An excellent happy hour value - great food and drink options.  I was there after a spring training game and they were slammed with customers. The staff all pitched in to help each other and make what could have been chaos a positive customer experience."}
{"text":"Just got back from here and loved it! My fiance and I enjoyed our shredded beef tacos, they weren't the greatest but they weren't the worst. I absolutely loved that they were $1 each since it's there Taco Tuesday special. I thought the cheese tasted funny, and my fiance apparently doesnt like deep fried tacos (WHAT?!?! How can you not like deep friend fatty goodness??) but other then that, yumm. We also ordered the shrimp ceviche, delicious. And I also ordered the Cucumber Margarita, which was recommended to me by our server. That was awesome, extremely refreshing. The service was fast and friendly, and I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Just not so great. The tacos were dried out with just meat and cheese. I didn't eat them but the server didn't ask if anything was wrong. Margarita was not great."}
{"text":"Great food and a cute outdoors courtyard area. They have a huge selection, and some good options for a vegan like myself. I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and Cien Agaves was able to accommodate our large group of 25 people. It seemed small on the first floor but really opened up on the second. I really enjoyed the artwork and Spanish themed baseball jerseys in the wall, such a fun vibe. We had an assortment of chips, salsa, guacamole but what really stood out was the queso verde with the pork. Simply fantastic! The house margarita seemed average to me, not too different than any other bar but I didn't try any of the specialized kinds (which I regret). Though everyone else got tacos, I stuck with a steak burrito. Very filling and tasty. For the amount of people our server had to deal with he was fantastic! Easily the best service we received on the trip. I'll be back for spring training at the end of the month and will come back for some lunch before the going to the game."}
{"text":"Just ok. We had the guacamole and margaritas. Everything needed salt. Service was ok. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"First night in Scottsdale, looking for a place to eat in the downtown area. Walked in after reading mixed views on YELP. Food was just ok, nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"50 cent tacos for four dollars while sitting in a back alley they describe as their \"patio\" while the waiters watch the birds carry away left over tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Visiting the area from out of town. Margaritas were excellent, we had the POM berry and the local. Happy hour specials were great as well. The guacamole app with pomegranate seeds was the perfect touch. Brad took care of us and made sure we always had everything, and he was hilarious. Perfect ending to our trip."}
{"text":"Walked upon this place tonight and very happy I did. Margarita perfect! My waitress Heidi very pleasant and attentive and offered to switch my taco after I realized it was too spicy for me. Tacos and guac perfect.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on Taco Tuesday for the $1.50 shredded beef tacos and they were delicious! I will definitely be going back for future Taco Tuesday deals"}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour yesterday and had horrible service. Our server was no where to be found to order more drinks, we had to ask for chips and salsa, and I was completely out of water at least 10 minutes and had to wave her down to ask for more. Then when we asked for boxes to take our food home our server just gave us a container for our guacamole and nothing to take the chips home in. We would of asked but it took her forever to do anything and we just wanted to leave at that point. I would understand if they were busy but it was still early and slow."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place.  My fiancée and I have been looking for a place to have our rehearsal dinner.  We want a good Mexican restaurant since we have family coming in from all over the world.  We have not inquired on the cost of renting their second floor, but that aside I would be very happy bringing out-of-towners here for dinner.  Unfortunately I work late, so I cannot partake in their happy hour, but we still wanted to try the place, so we came on a Tuesday at about 9 pm.  I got a house margarita and my fiancée got a strawberry mimosa.  I was very happy with the margarita, it was not overly sweet.  The mimosa on the other hand was not good.  It tasted watery and the strawberry seemed fake.  We let the manager know and he immediately took it off our bill.  We were there for taco Tuesday, so we ordered a bunch of the shredded beef tacos.  They were quite good and much bigger than I was expecting.  All in all it was a very good place, the service was great and the food was great.  We will be back to try a larger selection next time, and hopefully we will be bringing our friends and family here before our wedding!"}
{"text":"Made myself and husband very sick. Poor service. Poor quality food. Our child's food was not edible. Disappointed and probably will not return."}
{"text":"Stopped by Cien Agaves on a Tuesday evening. Was delighted to find so much energy in a restaurant at 9pm on a weekday. Gotta love a place that has over 10 different types of tacos. We tried 5 and all were unique and tasty. Very good chips and salsa as well. I'm sure there is plenty more great items on the menu and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Lot's of great choices in food! Well worth going to! Hreat flavor and doing Tacos the right wat, with cabbage and not lettuce. Brie, our server was very attentive and professional! Great job and great food! She's a keeper and deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this place. Colorful, artsy and southwestern. Lots to look at and nice noisy vibe. The hostess was prompt with finding us a table but if you could make reservations, I would because there aren't too many tables. The house margarita is really delicious...packs a nice punch too. Guacamole and green salsa stand out as fresh with great seasonings. I got the fajita bowl with carnitas, others at the table got the steak burrito ( not recommended) and steak salad. The house roasted Mexican street corn was delicious. What stands out as a real bummer is the service. The waitress really could have cared less if we were there, offered no recommendations (she doesn't eat here), and her attitude seemed kind of \"college bar annoyed.\" If they could step up the service game, this place would be four stars."}
{"text":"Great little spot for some good eats in Old Town Scottsdale. Loved the decor.. Service was fast and everything we had was very good!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was great. Shredder beef tacos on homemade crispy shells and fish tacos. The happy hour specials are a hit."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was ok. All in all I think it was somewhere I would eat again. Nice variety of tacos."}
{"text":"The best tacos I have ever had. Great margaritas, loved the chili salt rim on my mango margarita. Perfect mix of sweet, spicy and salty!"}
{"text":"Pork green Chile is VERY good. They have corn tortillas if you ask vs. the flour that are sent out.  Enjoyed the \"heat\" on the Habanero Margarita. Red salsa has WAY TOO MUCH raw onion. It overpowers the natural ingredients of the salsa. Surprised that I would find this on two separate visits. Chef should know better (or obviously not checking sous-chef)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink and grabbed a 50% off appetizer chicken nachos, which hit spot for the finger food while you enjoyed a beer. Micheal Ann (or michealina) was a great bartender. She took the time to give me a tequila education, so I was more than happy to try a couple other selections. I could see this place getting very busy, so I'm glad I hit it up around 4(ish). From my lack of knowledge I'll definitely have to do research or simply come back for the in-house Ciene Agave education!"}
{"text":"I don't know why you would go here.  Barrio Queen is super close and much better food. Help was nice.  Cheese crisp was tasty, as was salsa/chips.  Guacamole tasted like it was out of a salt-can.  Queso had lumps of cheese in it, not even melted.  Taco's were terrible - who puts cheddar cheese on taco's?  Really dry meats, not much of it on there.  Just a few frozen shrimp laying on a bed of dry rice?  Seriously?  The chicken tortilla soup tasted like chili.   It was a rough meal.  So, I guess if you just want a cheese crisp, come here.  I wouldn't touch anything else."}
{"text":"We tried several different tequilas and margaritas..not only were they all great the tacos were excellent. The little waitress was very friendly and checked on us pretty regular...we will be back!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I LOVE this place. The chips and salsa are great... And their fajitas are more of a tex mex style which we love. We go here often and usually have good service as well.   Obviously the margaritas are fantastic too. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"Happy hour was great- got the tostadas as an appetizer and they were amazing.  Good prices and fun atmosphere for games and groups."}
{"text":"Only okay.  On a visit to Old Scottsdale, I visited Cien Agaves based on Yelp reviews. The waitress was friendly - if not particularly knowledgeable. I asked for an old-fashioned \"not too sweet\" margarita - made with lime juice and simple syrup rather than sour mix. She had no idea what I was talking about.    I got the Two Taco plate  - a 'tinga' and a 'carne asada'.  The 'tinga' tasted like the oil in the deep fryer hadn't been changed in a while. kinda stale. The meat in the carne was both fatty and gristly. Maybe I just got a bad piece, but there were several inedible chunks in a fairly small taco. The rice and beans were bland.  After I finished up my meal, the waitress asked if I'd like any more chips. I mentioned that I hadn't  had any to start with, so I couldn't exactly have 'more'. She gasped \"didn't I bring you any chips?\" Nope.  She got them, but needn't have bothered. They - like the tinga taco - were too oily and  stale tasting. The salsas were just not all that interesting.  Nothing here was bad, but nothing was all that good either. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The food was a bit boring and the service not so good. It looked like there were a lot of people working there as a lot of people were going in and out of the kitchen. You could not tell if they were employees or not as almost everyone dressed differently. There were also some interactions between what I am guessing were employees that just was not appropriate in my opinion in a restaurant. Maybe I hit it on a bad night but I was not impressed in any way. It is a hole in the wall joint but they can be the best as well."}
{"text":"I came here alone on a Monday night. I sat at a high top by the bar. Service was awful and very slow but they were pretty busy. Margarita Monday, I guess! Salsa needed improvement. Being from Texas, I'm very picky. I ordered the fajita salad and was very impressed with the fresh corn and creamy cilantro dressing. Would recommend for a group setting."}
{"text":"Cien agaves has ruined other Mexican restaurants for me because they serve the  best margaritas in old town. Hands down."}
{"text":"Margaritas are good, nice selection of tequilas, the ceviche was pretty good. No salsa brought out with ceviche and chips appetizer. The tacos ordered were:. al pastor (average tasting), pulled pork (better than the previous), shrimp diabla (nice and spicy), carne asada (steak tasted cheap, not well marinated), and papas con chorizo (ordinary). Biggest issue were the tortillas! And this is what makes or breaks the taco. They are tortillas from the store! They are not made on the property, they tasted old and were tough to eat.  The margaritas were tasty and they are well served with tequila. We drank a house margarita called the local, which was very good and also had the Cadillac margarita which is pretty strong.  Best thing was the ambiance. Great decor, good party atmosphere if you go at night, good wait staff and friendly hostesses.  Would recommend for drinks and appetizers, but I have tasted and made better tacos at home."}
{"text":"When you blow into town like tumbleweed and need some drinks and food this is a great spot. It's location in old town area is great. Easy parking about a block away. It's a cross between a bar and a restaurant.  It just has its own feel. The food was delicious. My friend had the prickly pear margarita and talked about it our whole trip. So it must have been way above average!  I would gladly go back!"}
{"text":"Hibiscus margaritas...oh how I love you!! Haha   So I was in Scottsdale last weekend, visiting friends and going to the Interpol concert Saturday night. My friend Chantage and I arrived in Scottsdale early afternoon and were immediately whisked away by our friends to Cien Agaves for margaritas and tacos. (I have the best friends in the world!) With so many margarita choices, yes, it was hard to narrow it down to one to start with. But the hibiscus is my favorite flower, so why not try a hibiscus margarita?? Yum, yum and more yum!! And they were in very generous glasses, too! I want one right now and it's only 11am! On the second margarita, we decided to order some tacos. Again, the choices...uh, I wanted them all! But I opted for the Dos Tacos Especial which was my choice of two tacos, beans and rice. I love mahi mahi, so that's what I ordered. Fabulousness, I tell ya! The mahi mahi was grilled to perfection, the beans were smoky and woody but the rice, eh, was okay. Not my favorite. The third hisbiscus margarita made up for it, though! My friends had seared ahi tuna tacos, lobster tacos and carnitas tacos which by the sounds of their 'mmm's and 'ohh's' I can tell you were just as awesome as my mahi mahi tacos!  Our bartender, Blair, was cute, friendly and funny. I hope he enjoyed serving us as much as we enjoyed him! We'll be back to see him (and try other tacos and margaritas) again soon...thanks, Blair! :)"}
{"text":"Took a good friend's recommendation and tried this Old Town landmark. An outstanding Happy Hour with really good appetizers and house margaritas!!! Service was quick, efficient and very friendly.  Definitely returning!! Excellant value for the money!!"}
{"text":"I'm a Mexican food fanatic, and have been having issues finding a place that isn't so BLAH lately. Well, luckily I had the privilege to try out Cien Agave for a promo video we filmed and I was impressed!   First I was able to try out the shrimp ceviche...a-ma-zing. It was so fresh and very light in the citrus. Too many times you get a ceviche that is over-powering in the lime juice, but Cien Agaves' is perfectly refreshing.  Then we were able to try out the shredded beef taco, lobster taco, and the Taco Al Pastor. I'm not usually a shredded beef taco fan, but let me just say that I've been craving it ever since. And what's even better is you can get them for $1 every Tuesday! And the Taco Al Pastor (marinated pork and grilled pineapple) was to die for. Yum yum yum. Can I go now please???  And of course the margaritas...they have reeeeeeeaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyy good margaritas. I enjoyed the award winning house margarita...its a really great classic margarita, where they freshly squeeze the citrus, no pre-made crap in it at all. So good. And the cucumber margarita was amazing.   Cien Agaves is just a really great little treasure in Old Town Scottsdale. They have a great atmosphere and a great staff. Go check them out."}
{"text":"Had the Chx taco and beef on happy hour and my date had a giant margarita and we spent $14 on 4 huge gourmet tacos and a drink . Very busy so if you have a large group or need table make a reservation and staff is amazing very happy !"}
{"text":"I ordered three tacos and all 3 were downright lousy.  Can't remember the last time I had food this bad.  The shrimp taco was overbreaded and in a sickly sweet sauce, the shredded beef taco was very tiny and thankfully, I can't remember what the third taco tasted like.  To the reviewer who posted that these tacos are top notch.... what are you smoking?  I waited forever to get my food and saw numerous other people who came in after me get their food.  Waiter was MIA. Not coming back....ever."}
{"text":"I've never written one of these reviews before but after our experience here I felt I needed to. For those of you who don't want to read my rant, food is awful and made us physically sick.  My boyfriend and I split the chicken fajitas and his dad had the chili relleno, which he said was mediocre. There's no other way to say it, our fajitas were horrible! There were a total of 8 small pieces of tough non-delicious chicken. I kid you not, EIGHT PIECES! And I swear there must have been a whole large onion in it. That, paired with the canned beans and dry rice, had both me and my boyfriend sick all night and part of the following morning. And to wrap it all up, the waitress forgot my boyfriends drink which isn't a big deal but she also forgot she was at work and literally had to flag her down from playing on her phone. The only thing we liked there was my mango Margarita. Props for that I guess..."}
{"text":"Best happy hour everyday! Tinga tacos & chicken quesadillas are always delicious. Love that they give complimentary chips and salsa too. One of my favorite spots in old town!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  The service is great; the margaritas are great; the food sucks.  Both times my meals tasted like an old shoe.  I'm not sure how they get that exact flavor in the food on two separate occasions but it is not good.  Two strikes you're out."}
{"text":"Great layout. Sat at the upstairs bar, so many drink choices! Tacos were good not great; happy hour prices were great, $2 tacos, $2 beer. Seafood salad was good but too much lettuce and not enough topping. Would return."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for a birthday and once for a date night, and been impressed both times.  I've tried their house margarita and their hibicus margarita - both were very good, but there really wasn't much of a difference in taste.  They have a great variety of tacos on the menu for about 4 bucks each.  Their fish tacos are delicious.  They have a 2 taco combo with rice and beans for I think 8.95.  I've come on a weekend night both times, and both times the place was pretty empty.  I'm not sure why!  They've got a great selection of drinks and this would be a fun place to get a night out in Old Town started.  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is a good, fun Mexican restaurant in Old Town.   I've been here several times, and have enjoyed their extensive Margarita selection and their wonderful salsas (the house red salsa is my favorite).   They have a good selection of tacos, allowing you to mix and match, and the guacamole is great...as is he cheese dip and chips appetizer. What is in that cheese dip that makes it so addicting?  Wow. It's good!  They have a smaller bar and that can fill up quickly, however you can eat at the bar (full menu) or at a table.   The staff have been very friendly and accommodation when I've been here, and this seems to be a spot where people like to come and relax...with a margarita.   Overall, a good spot!"}
{"text":"Guac, Tacos, and Fajita Bowl were all amazing. Booked an open table reservation and was immediately seated. Our food came out super fast and was delicious, our waitress was really sweet, outdoor seating was nice, and portion sizes were a nice size!"}
{"text":"Excellent margaritas. Service well below average. Hostess  clueless. Pace of meal was despicable. Ordered appetizers and a meal. Meal arrived two minutes after appetizer. Food was very flat. Could probably get better flavor at Taco Bell. Won't be coming back except to drink."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Server very friendly, food was AMAZING, bartender Alex very nice and friendly and busser Jacob very quick to clean up and friendly. Definitely want to go back again."}
{"text":"My brother-in-law had a Groupon for a tequila tasting event Thursday, 9-27.  Great atmosphere with bright colors, Dia de los Muertes theme, luchadors, and sugar skulls.  The tequila event was upstairs and was run well.  Nice to see Roger selling his own wares (Mexican Moonshine)!  Decided to hang out after event and have cigars on the downstairs patio.  I was initially vary of the service from earlier reviews, but our waitress was attentive and made out taco selections for us.  Tacos were fantastic.  The breaded fish was cooked well and not oily.  The carne asada was tender and the guacamole was fresh.  Even on regular hours the price was right.  Definitely a place to go back for during happy hour.  Only giving four starts since I have not tried more on the menu, but that extra star is around the corner!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place a 2 star is because the food is fantastic but the service is absolutely horrible. We have come to this place very regularly for years and the staff changes almost monthly and never improves. It's almost a breeding ground for terrible servers. We sat down today and ordered food and a margarita. By the time we had finished our food the waitress had still not returned to check on us or ask if we wanted to order another drink. I finally got up and walked to the bar where she was just chatting with a friend and was shocked that I wanted something and actually caught her slacking off. I wish I could include a picture of the entire place. There is a total of 3 tables and 2 servers. Not a lot for either of these people to take care of. I don't ask for a lot. I just want someone to stop by once in a while to see if my drink needs refilled or maybe I want another taco. We will never know because they never gave it a chance."}
{"text":"First off this place should have a way higher rating then 3 stars. Came here because my boyfriend bought a travelzoo deal and the food and margaritas were awesome. We both had seafood enchiladas and split a tostada appetizer. It was absolutely delicious. This restaurant also has a great taco Tuesday deal 1.50 shredded beef tacos and 2 dollar tecates. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We came here with a party of 9.  Our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived because a couple occupying our last table we needed had been sitting there for an hour with empty plates and glasses.  My pet peeve!  Please!  If you are a customer, don't just sit and take up space without ordering something - it's so rude!  Nevertheless, the manager was able to set us up outside and actually I preferred that - coming from Oregon we will take outside seating whenever we can get it!  The salsa was so good the chips were mainly just a disguise for me drinking it.  We got a pitcher of sangria and a bunch of margaritas, all very good.  I really liked the flavor of the margarita with the habanero in it.  It was VERY spicy, but the flavor was better than some I've had with a jalapeno.    Our server was really nice and attentive and everyone enjoyed their meals.  The only thing I didn't care for was the pico on the tacos.  It was so onion-heavy it made the tacos a bit bitter."}
{"text":"Was not impressed.  The specialty margs were very pricey for a small glass, but they were tasty. - just small. I ordered a taco with a corn tortilla and it came out with a flour tortilla.  We said something about it and they brought out another one. However, the new one was also with flour. I also ordered a beer and requested a glass. It took 15 minutes to get the glass.  No apologies. And no compensation on the bill. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Two words: TACO TUESDAY!  Tecate beer - $2.00 Beef Taco - $1.00 ALL DAY  This place was packed.  Live music started at about 9pm.  I have to be honest...I only had the beef tacos (they were a dollar each!) and a beer...I did sample my friends Margs and they are delicious...each one handmade, no mixes!  And there is a pomegranate tequila you must try.  You have to go on Tuesday night!"}
{"text":"Came here not knowing what to expect. I don't drink, so the abundance of alcohol (mostly tequila) was not something that enticed me about this establishment. Customers who drink would probably enjoy it more. Pretty cool design inside though. The tacos are pretty good, the rice isn't great, but the black beans are delicious."}
{"text":"Being a Mexican I love me some tequila and mezcal and margaritas. I've seen cien agaves on my yelp a few times so after the crushbrew fest this spot was walking distance I figured it was the right time. The place is small and super cool with all the decorations and paintings on the walls it definitely catches your eyes so I was stoked to try the food and drinks. The salsas are bomb specially the Red ill give that 5 stars. The food I was disappointed big time. The carnitas were dry and were not carnitas they were more of a machaca dried shredded beef and was way salty. The beans and rice were ok. The drinks again disappointed the margaritas were very sour and watered down,no wayyyyy these are the best or even close. The service was good, amy was friendly and did a great job but, food wise and drinks they were below standards. I think just because they are in old town they have a good rep but there's a lot better and more authentic Mexican food and drinks in 90 percent of phx or scottsdale and cheaper. A lot of hype and not enough substance."}
{"text":"The food was good, the wait staff very attentive and a big flirty (good thing!), but they have over cien tequilas! The diablo came robes was very good....spiccccccy!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it has taken me this long to try this place but I'm so glad I finally did!!  We came on a Tuesday, so they had $2 shredded beef tacos.  I wasn't expecting much for $2 but they were fantastic!  They were also a good size (I was expecting them to be pretty small).  I also had a cup of their poblano soup.  Wow, it was so delicious.  It has a lot of heat (which is to be expected), but in my opinion was the perfect amount of heat.  It also had incredible flavor.  The salsas were also both very flavorful (my favorite was the green, although I wish it were a bit spicier).  I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"So good! So friendly! So full!  We came in on a hot fall day in the afternoon.  They seated us on their great shaded patio, which gave the kids a little room to be kids, had a cool breeze, and kept us out of the sun.  We ordered a few different appetizers to split between three adults: guacamole, queso verde, a delicious creamy poblano soup, and the green chili cheese crisp.  Everything was delicious and the portions were huge.  I'm used to getting a relatively small bowl of guac or queso at most restaurants, not here.  We had leftovers of everything and were all stuffed. Our waiter was super nice, gave great recommendations, was patient with our kids, and helped make it a great experience."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for Happy Hour on a Thursday and I am so glad that we did.  The place has a great vibe and even greater Happy Hour Specials.  The chips and salsa were on point and went perfectly with our margaritas.  I also had the Two Taco Platter.  I had both types of shrimp tacos- the Island Shrimp and the Diablo Shrimp.  Both were excellent, but I preferred the Island Shrimp.  The Diablo is advertised as hot, but it wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. They have a great wait staff, great food, and great drinks. You cant go wrong here. My favorite are the Tinga Chicken Tacos, and I like to wash it down with a Cadillac Margarita! If I'm with my girlfriend, we like to share the \"Gigante\" with is a 56 ounce margarita for $20! I take all my friends here who come to visit!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant on a whim because I had a craving for Mexican food and was in the area. The Happy Hour menu made our meal tasty and affordable, the service was fast and friendly, and the music was loud enough to hear, but not so loud that conversation was difficult. Overall, I had a wonderful experience and would eat here again."}
{"text":"Meh.   Okay....  Not great.    This restaurant had lots of good reviews on yelp and I love tacos so I thought I would give it a try. I travel for a living and make it a point to find taco stands, taco trucks, or anything taco related wherever I go.    I was disappointed here.  I read several reviews about the service been so-so to lousy, and that was my experience today.  The hostess was slow to recognize me when I walked up, took some menus and said she would be right back. She did not say hi or welcome me, just turned around and left.  I went to go sit at the bar and was also slow to be recognized as far as a greeting.  I also had to ask for chips and salsa just like several other yelpers have complained about, because I sat there for five minutes after ordering my tacos, and I still didn't have chips or salsa.    I ordered the tacos al pastor and ahi tuna combo with rice and beans.  There was plenty of tuna on the one taco, but the taco Al Pastor was the smallest most pathetic taco I think I have ever seen.  I think it had more pineapple than pork.   In fact I'm not even sure there was any meat in it.  Way less tasty than they should have been.    As for the chips and salsa, the chips were stout, not the flimsy kind and were good enough.  The salsa was thin and runny but the green and red both had good flavor.  Sad to say, then chips and salsa were the best part."}
{"text":"Amazing Tequila selection and delicious Margaritas on happy hour. The Chorizo pizza appetizer and the green chili pulled pork queso were both superb! I tried 3 different tacos and loved all 3. I ate here with 7 others and not one person walked away unhappy."}
{"text":"Cien Agaves is a great addition to downtown Scottsdale -- and it provides a fun, relaxed atmosphere into the mix of places that either seem to be a) dive-y and dumpy or b) snotty and superficial. Cien Agaves has a cool, open building and has some neat art hanging on the walls.  The margaritas I had here were head and shoulders above the ones I've had at nearly every other Valley establishment (especially at places like Dos Gringos or Salty Senorita).  I came here after work with friends and we ordered a house margarita for $4 (happy hour special). It had a lot of ice in it, but tasted really fresh and packed a punch. Then I tried one of their more expensive prickly pear margaritas -- yum! Delicious, without being cloyingly sweet. We didn't get any food, but the chips were great and the two salsas included a pico de gallo and a really amazing green salsa that included tomatillos and, I think, cumin. Great!  The only downside was the service. Our waiter was really nice, but the poor guy seemed completely overworked -- I think they only had one waiter for the entire restaurant and patio. If they hired another one or two servers, the experience would be more enjoyable AND they'd probably move a lot more margaritas! But I definitely plan on coming back here and seeing if maybe that aspect was just an off-night for them.  Try the patio if you can -- it's lovely and it gets you away from the rather loud music that could be playing inside."}
{"text":"Bartenders Jeremy and MichelleMichael were at the top of their game!  It was both happy hour and tinga taco night! Jeremy was able to arrange for my tacos to be wrapped in lettuce!  Amazing.  We also got the guacamole (which has pomegranate) and I used as salad dressing on my cien salad.  It was all so good!"}
{"text":"The Happy Hour here is a yes.  Their Margarita's are pretty damn good and so was the appetizer I had, the tostada. I like that they have happy hour everyday unlike a lot of places which only have it on the weekdays."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that when you sit down at a Mexican restaurant, you shouldn't have to ask for chips & salsa,  let alone ask for it 3 times!! My boyfriend & I started off with the habanero-lime margarita. Great fresh flavor but we weren't sure where the habanero disappeared to. There was no heat whatsoever. I ordered the 2 taco special--carnitas & shredded beef. Part of my order was wrong, there were only 2 pieces of carnitas, and the shredded beef taco was like a running faucet. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada burrito or should I say the 'rice burrito'...it had nothing but rice & was dry as hell. To top it all off, our waitress never even asked how we enjoyed our meal. Perhaps that was intentional on her part since our entire meal sucked!! Yelpers beware...don't waste your time or your $ on this place!"}
{"text":"I gave them a five-star because I've been coming here for almost iron years and I've never had a bad experience. But this is my first time making a review. The chips and salsa is Bland. But I must say the tortilla chicken soup here is to die for I. I haven't been here all year so. I love the tacos on Tuesday I love the taquitos those are really good to have a great Happy Hour. The staff is always fast and friendly and the Beer Rita is in the best on Mondays it is $6. I probably will be back tomorrow for Taco Tuesday"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner while visiting Scottsdale with two friends. While the tacos were alright, the guacamole and fajita salad are what earned this place four stars. Additionally, the staff was very kind and we were seated promptly on arrival without a reservation."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and stopped in because the happy hour menu was enticing. The food was okay, the drinks were great... We had the house margarita and a couple specialties. You could tell the tequila used was high quality. It was smooth and flavorful.   If ever we are in Scottsdale again we'll definitely stop in for a drink and a laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious, Affordable, and Nutritious.  OK maybe not that last part, but priorities people!  The Happy Hour is incredible (3-7 PM daily) plus Margarita Mondays and Taco Tuesdays.  It's a perfect place for a Mexican escape right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  We were looking for Scottsdale's best tacos and margaritas and found them both in the same place!  Great job Michael V. and staff!  We couldn't have asked for a better way to kick off our exploration of Old Town."}
{"text":"Ok, I think 9 years later is sufficient time to update my review. I've been here a couple of times over the years, but was never really impressed.   Went again last night with a friend. I'm sad to say it just wasn't good. We sat at the bar. We had margaritas, which weren't good. It's supposed to their thing, so I was surprised they haven't evolved over time. It's so easy to get quality, fresh lime margaritas, that I thought they'd be on par with other places in town. They aren't. I've had better at several places including Blanco & CRUjiente Tacos too.   Another odd thing is that the chips weren't good. I can't explain it, but they tasted off for tortilla chips. We also ordered the street corn, but service was spotty the whole time we were there, & we never got it. We finally gave up & asked for the check. It wasn't on there. Nothing says bad service like it even getting your food order. Like they just forgot to even put it in. It's just odd.   Overall, I guess this place appeals to someone, but it sure isn't me. There too many places in town with better margaritas & service."}
{"text":"I've only done take out from here, but it has quickly become my favorite for Mexican food in the area. Their nachos and green chile dip are amazing. The nachos have tons of cheese on them and the take out size is enormous. I had the fish tacos as well, but they should probably be eaten at the restaurant. They were good, just something that should be eaten as soon as it's served. Definitely looking forward to going in person and trying out their margaritas."}
{"text":"Good casual ambience, with good, but not sensational food. I was not wowed - but also not sad I went in."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed with Cien Agaves, as I'm a true Mexican Food Connoisseur!  I'm all about flavor!  The Guacamole tasted like it came out of plastic bag with a few pomegranate seeds added! Absolutely flavorless, as were the Tinga Tacos, and shredded beef tacos!  My $12 Mimosa Rita was presented well but very under impressive! Service was good, and I'll most likely try this place again, ordering different items next time!"}
{"text":"Love their house margaritas! Especially when they are 1/2 off during happy hour!  The tacos are really good.  We really liked the island shrimp tacos.  We also had the chicken quesadilla and the guacamole dip.  All was very tasty."}
{"text":"None of their staff seems very excited to be there ever!  I have been here at all different times and it is always the same humdrum.    This last time I went with a friend of mine for a late dinner.  There was still 40 minutes till close, so it was not like we skipped in at the last second.  You could tell the bartender was not too happy about us showing up.  He offered us drinks and I had to request a menu, then he stood there staring at us while we decided what to order.  We ended up ordering 3 different kinds of tacos.  He failed to ask us if we wanted flour or corn tortillas, and they came out with flour tortillas; I am not a fan of flour tortillas.  It was just not a pleasant dining experience aside from my company.    I can say they have a great taco Tuesday Happy Hour, but otherwise, I would never come here for anything else."}
{"text":"Very good and we even ordered our dinner as take out! Three of us ordered a ten taco package. At first, I did not think it would be enough; however, I was full after eating 3 tacos. The carne Asada and chorizo with potato was fantastic! Note: the menu on yelp is not an updated menu. Also, the pico is spicy (one of my friends does not like spicy things).  Would have been 5 stars if we got rice and beans with this which I thought was supposed to come with the dinner.  Great food."}
{"text":"Really good tacos and margaritas. I'll be back. The beans were great and the rice was good. Becca was so friendly."}
{"text":"Was a great place to just wander in off the street. The workers were very nice. The waitress did a good job. If I lived here I would come back again and again"}
{"text":"Heard they had the best tacos in Scottsdale. They were good - not great, but good. Great selection/choices. Chips-salsa weren't impressive (though the red salsa was noticeably better than the tomatillo). Tried 5 different tacos between 2 of us and found them to be just OK/good."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a Sunday night dinner. Service was good & the food was delicious! Ordered a mango margarita, it was good but the ice was not crushed up enough. The taco selection is awesome with plenty of options! Best part is they didn't go light on the meat fillings!"}
{"text":"Basic bar with excellent beeritas and awesome shrimp tacos that were on $2 special Mon night. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Margaritas were awesome. Service was super fast and friendly. We sat outside by the fire pit it was a gorgeous evening in Scottsdale. Guac was super fresh.  There were 3 of us and we all had 2 different tacos off the menu and were all happy!  I think the carbine asada was the best."}
{"text":"Three words: creamy poblano soup. Even if this place did not have a liquor license I would still drive all the way to Old Town just for the soup. It's seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten. I don't just throw that around, either. It's perfectly balanced and I crave it like I do sushi.  But thank the Lord it DOES have a liquor license, otherwise it would just be called \"Tacos.\" They hand-squeeze fresh limes for every single margarita. It makes for sore hands and more work for the bartender, but it is certainly worth it. It is honestly the best margarita I have ever had (aside from my own homemade ones, of course). The best thing about it is it's $3.50 during happy hour (3-7pm everyday), and happy hour lasts ALL DAY on Sunday during football season. Pretty awesome. I'm pretty in love with this place.  Also on Tuesdays, tinga tacos (chicken) are $1.50 and shredded beef tacos are $1.00 (if I remember correctly, don't quote me on that). Regardless, they're cheap. Also some cheap $2-3 beer deals, but beer is the same everywhere unless you're at a brewery, so whatever about that.  All in all, I love this place. OPEN A TEMPE LOCATION PLEASETHANKS!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place to hit up before going to the clubs. Tacos aren't particularly super awesome but they are tasty treats without breaking the bank. They have many variety of the tasy tacos, ex; al pastor & carne asada. To pair up the taco treats. You can enjoy the many varietys of margaritas with their 100 different varieties of tequilas."}
{"text":"Came in at 10:20 pm on a Sunday evening after seeing they close at 11 (been driving around looking for dinner).  Upon entering, the bartender greeted us by saying, \"the kitchen is about to close, would you like to quickly place your order\"?  Then she shoved two menus into mine and my Fiance's hands.  I questioned the rush and found out the kitchen wasn't closing until 10:45 (why before 11?).    Upon taking a table our waitress also hurried us to order.  When our food arrived at 10:35, the meat in my tacos was room temperature, while my Fiance's meal was cooked well.  The waitress was just a step down from jogging everywhere and rushed every part of the service.  At one point her hurry to clear our table, she knocked over my beer which was thankfully 90% empty by then.    I don't think I'd like return, especially within an hour of closing.  Update: Both of us have had extreme stomach issues since this meal now as well."}
{"text":"My friend and I loved the fajita bowls!! So tasty. Veggies were nicely season and perfectly cooked. We both added chicken and were more than satisfied. We also got the chips, guacamole, and salsa appetizer. Lovedddd the green salsa and thought the pomegranate seeds on the guac was interesting! Never would have thought to do that but it worked. Also loved the decor and the vibe. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Mexican food and I can't believe I have not found this place sooner! It's only a mile from my house! The food is amazing....their guacamole is outstanding...stopping on the way home will easy become a habit!"}
{"text":"Happy hour!!!!  Ok so not the greatest but still good guacamole pretty good quesadilla was ok margs nothing to write home about.... Jus sayin  Time for fish tacos....... So I visited on Tuesday and I have to say the grilled fish and shrimp tacos are nothing to rave about, very dry chunk of fish with a little mango (i think) pico sauce."}
{"text":"Great ambiance- a nice mix of modern Scottsdale, old school western scottsdale, and latin touches. The tacos are fantastic and the menu is flexible so you can try many different ones. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Not bad Taco/Mexican food place. I had the Chicken Burrito and it was a 6 out of 10. Chips and Salsa were delicious and they have a huge selection of Tequila. I'd love to re-visit this restaurant anther go and update my review."}
{"text":"Great little spot in old Scottsdale.  They have a great happy hour specials and cute patio.  The food didn't knock out socks off but it was decent.    The wait staff was nice, location and atmosphere was good!"}
{"text":"Huge margarita , tequila and taco selection  The food is simple and good ! Which is good and large portion . They have great happy hour . I Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"They have a huge selection of tequila here. From cold to room temperature, they have it for you, and you can even have them in different flavors. Their tres tacos is a good deal for about $14. Comes with corn chips, two sides of your choice like beans and Spanish rice. You can also mix and match your tres tacos too. They have a fantastic outdoor seating area which at night, it's delightful to be out with your friends, enjoying the nice meal. Service was great, and the staff gave great recommendations.  Until then, Cheers! ~ :p"}
{"text":"It's definitely a place for the younger crowd.  VERY loud inside.  I had a couple tacos that were pretty good. The waitress was great."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for the support with Red for Ed movement. Your resturant is great and great customer service. I will defiently be coming back. Thanks again"}
{"text":"I have came here multiples times and it's always just as good as the last... amazing margaritas, tacos, and nachos... it goes without saying that the Mexican decor and sugar skull accents make for a neat experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best not the worst. Typical mexmeican bar food. Was not impressed with tortila soup. however burrito was decent.   margs are decent as well."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were really awesome. They were pretty busy though and dinner took about 25 minutes. Fun atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...  Started with the guacamole which was very good.  Drinks were out of this world great.  Had shredded beef tacos and enchiladas which were both very good also."}
{"text":"Best place ever! Street corn is so good! Prickly pear margarita is a must! And the shredded beef in the tacos is marinated to perfection! Can't get enough! Don't get me started on the guac and salsa!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  I love this place. Always request for Kenzie's section. She's a riot and knows what's best."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere... FANTASTIC GREEN CHILE SOUP!!!!!! just like the one you find in Denver"}
{"text":"The bangin'est happy hour (3-7 EVERY day!!) in Old Town by miles, Cien Agaves is everything I thought I hated (the fratty old town crowd), but everything that speaks directly to my soul (cheap and delicious). Margs are never even my go to, but at 4 bucks a pop for a delightfully strong house margarita, how could I say no? Also on HH: half priced apps and $2.50 tinga tacos.   You can't really go wrong with any of their tacos, at least in my experience. Shredded beef and carne asada both excellent, and the island shrimp is a bit of a sleeper hit. But I always come crawling back to the tinga. God, it's just fantastic, especially on the hard shells--I'm not usually a hard-shelled taco kinda gal, but these are the perfect amount of crispy fried perfection.   My one small gripe about Cien is that while the food is all amazing, it's pretty hard to get in and out in a tight hour during lunch time. What we've ended up doing in the past is ordering, and then asking for our checks as our food comes out so we can bounce ASAP. Not the hugest deal, just a bit of a hassle gettin' back to that 9-5. That being said, I've always had amazing service; all of the hostesses, servers, and bartenders are super nice and helpful, and check in often to make sure things are still going swimmingly.  One oddball bonus point: their guac comes with pomegranate seeds! Yum!"}
{"text":"Get ready to die of natural causes before you get your food. ......I haven't seen food leave the kitchen since yesterday."}
{"text":"Fairly good and spicy tacos, efficient and polite service. If looking for bar scene this seemed to be happening - went on a weekend evening and it was quite busy and a bit loud, so not for a cozy intimate outing but a fine spot for tacos!"}
{"text":"Well, Taco Tuesday is still rolling along here and doing quite well. We were actually seated in that Alley and it wasn't so bad, but on that night a storm was brewing and we nearly got blown away eating. We arrived during happy Hour and tried the plain cheese crisp which was quite tasty with some extra added sauce they had placed on top. The chicken tinga tacos are just $2.50 each and those are all white meat with lettuce, cheese on that hard shell. The beef tacos for happy hour are also budget friendly and still pretty good. The margs are half price, but they continued to be quite watery. A tourist hotspot, so during season might be tough to get seat."}
{"text":"Average Mexican food. Nothing really outside the box for being in Scottsdale. Seems like a very popular hangout. Fajita bowl was mostly black beans."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday they have shredded beef tacos $2 can't beat that I love the chorizo cheese crisp to die for"}
{"text":"Loved this location in old Scottsdale.   Marg options are many!  Cute side patio to sit out on when the weather is cooler.  Have been back a few times."}
{"text":"I have just moved to the area, and was looking for a place to grab a bite to eat.  I was strolling around old town and came across Cien Agaves, and I'm glad I did.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was great, quick service and friendly.  I grabbed the menu and began to peruse the menu.  I saw that they offered many types of tacos and you could do a mix and match of the many different types.  I thought that this was awesome.  I selected Island Shrimp Taco, the Carnitas and the Carne Asada.  I really enjoyed all of them especially the shrimp and carne.  The Carnitas was a little dry, but oh well.  I'll definitely be back and with the many different choice, I look forward to making my way through the taco stand."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for dinner. The place is very cute.  The food was just ok, nothing special about It. But they did have some great food/drink specials till 7pm when we were there. Will I go back for the food? no. The food lacks flavor and that is what makes Mexican food so great.  But I'll go back for margarita.  Overall ok."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and atmosphere. Even  welcomed my service dog in the patio, which had to be entered by walking through the restaurant.   Everything we ate was great. Only disappointment was the avocado margarita-- expected the taste or texture of an avocado. It tasted just like the regular margarita which was half the price at happy hour. Great service. Have been five times and will return for sure."}
{"text":"To Owners, you should really consider covering the bright window so your first booth can be sat around 6!! We got the last booth avail and then saw 3 parties try to sit in the too much glare booth as they were warned by the hostess, and then upset that the only seating left was upstairs.    The happy hour was good, I tried the house margarita, tinga taco, and an al pastor taco as well. I really didn't like how small the plate with the taco was, the tacos were almost falling off of the plate. I eat a lot of tacos at different restaurants and the entire experience was messed up because the 2 tacos were falling into each other on the really small plate. I liked the tinga taco but not the Al Pastor.   Might come back for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are just Ok here.  Probably shouldn't have gotten an enchilada in a more \"tex mex\" kinda place ... however the service and margaritas are definitely something everyone should experience!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cien Agaves twice. Their tacos are great (especially the Al Pastor). Great atmosphere here as well. I was with a large group the last time I was here and they readily arranged seating for us even though they were fairly busy and we did not have a reservation. Over all I would recommend them without hesitation."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a booth, and when we got there we were seated right away. Yesterday we tried to stop in, and get on a waitlist but the hosts were unable to give a wait time which was weird. Our server Sierra was great tonight, but she was getting her but kicked with as many tables as she had. Was also a little strange not seeing a manager that should be running the floor on a busy Saturday to help when needed. Tacos, rice, and beans were mediocre and dry compared to the other visits in the past few months. Nachos were decent."}
{"text":"An annual favorite that just went from 4 to 5 stars thanks to Monika. A favorite Spring Training stop while visiting Scottsdale.  Happy Hour is the best. Monika's suggestions were right on! Started with the Queso Verde and then on to the Cheese Crisp (it's actually a pizza on a flour tortilla.) It was great. Topped off with half price Margaritas. How can you go wrong? We'll be back.  Try the patio if it's not too hot.  Kinda noisy inside."}
{"text":"This restaurant has AMAZING tacos/food but HORRIBLE service. This disconnect makes it very hard for me to make up my mind about this place. I have been 4 times between mid April and mid June.   PROS: A big variety of tacos, a lot of them are unique and combine great flavors you don't see everywhere else. Love the shrimp and the carnitas/pork. Great chips and Salsa. The margs are really delicious and refreshing also - good portion size and no sugary syrup. Nice atmosphere and patio.   CONS: I have had a different server everytime so it isn't just one person bringing down my review. I feel like the servers have to be reminded of what there job is. It should be automatic to bring by chips and salsa or at least ask if the table wants it. I ALWAYS have to request this. The drinks take a while and often the waitress comes back a second time to double check the drink order. Mainly I feel that they are unattentive and just don't put a lot of effort into customer service which is really too bad because it is a great place.  I am not high maintenance and do not ask a lot, but I do like to be served. Whenever I bring someone new here I always add a disclaimer \"You will love the food, but just as a warning the service isn't great\" so that the person will want to stick around for the course to be served.   I will continue to come here and eat the delicious tacos that I love so much, but will also continue to get extremely annoyed with the staff. This place has amazing potential if they could just work that kink out - it would be perfect.  **UPDATE August 2012 - At the beginning of the month I took some friends here from out of the country. Our food was very good and I am very happy to say that we had great service. I didn't recognize our waitress and I wish I would have gotten her name. She did a great job, was attentive, and was very polite. Made the experience so much better!"}
{"text":"This is my husbands and I go to place for great Mexican. Excellent happy hour, tasty margs and large portions! I love the pork chili with a fried egg on top, also the Mexican pizza with pork is HUGE! Love the patio in by the fire place in the winter and the bar area is a great place to kick back and meet up with friends. Tacos come a-la-cart or with rice and beans and there are about 30 different kinds to choose from! If your into tequila they have just about every kind. Staff is friendly and fast. All I know is when I suggest this place for dinner, everyone always is excited to go!"}
{"text":"We felt like really good Mexican food in Old Town Scottsdale and remembered this cute very popular  smaller  restaurant. We were seated  quickly. I ordered a wonderful ceviche with big chunks of shrimp.  So fresh and full of flavor. Wow can't wait to come back ! I ordered the 2taco plate with the potatoes. This is the first time I've had a potato taco and I was pretty impressed. The other taco was the mahi mahi also very good.  It also looks like the top area is a good place to have wedding showers and events."}
{"text":"Well that was an interesting set up.  I walked in and sat down at around 12 noon and 2 waitresses passed me by several times never said a word to me. The bartender finally saved the day when he walked over and handed me a menu.  I don't know if he was supposed to play the role of bartender AND waiter  but he did a better job with customer service than the two waitresses did.  The food was good I'll give them that, but I'm really turned off by the over all customer service except for the bartender."}
{"text":"When I found out I was going to Scottsdale for a vacation, I signed up for Groupon and was excited to score a tequila tasting at Cien Agaves! Well, I didn't read the fine print and it was only for the last Thursday of every month.  Not a problem - the owner/manager was great when I told him I had kind of skimmed over the fine print, and he still honored the group on.  We had delicious tacos, yummy margaritas and left thinking how great people in AZ are :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Cien Agaves this past week with a groupon. The groupon does not cover happy hour food/drinks so I ordered a margarita from the regular menu. $12.00 and it was all juice. My husband ordered the fried chimichanga which he absolutely loved....I ordered the seared ahi salad ($15)which was utterly disgusting. It was a large plate of a bunch of salad leafs and about 6 strips of ahi. The ahi was not pink at all... and was mushy ewww!  Obviously it was previously frozen.  Lesson learned....order mexican food when eating at a mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I went into Cien Agave last week because I've heard so much about the margaritas. My server, Anne, gave me an excellent recommendation! She suggested the Cadillac margarita which knocked my socks off it was so good! The food was okay but I would definitely come back for the well crafted margaritas and the fun, perky service! Anne insisted that I try the avocado margarita next time so of course I have to come back!"}
{"text":"Average food, awesome alcohol.  I think my experience here is why I have yet to even attempt the food at bar/restaurant fixtures like Loco Patron or Salty Seniorita.  Maybe Cien Agaves tries to shoot for the restaurant aspect a little more - they might have to with their lack of a patio to rival their competitors.    One thing I've noticed about this place is that it's usually dead except on Taco Tuesday.  There's something charming about eating shredded beef tacos and drinking cans of $2 Tecate with a bunch of affluent white people.  That being said, for a buck the tacos aren't bad and there's live music sometimes which I'm a huge sucker for.  The margaritas are good and strong, which is another of my weak points.  If you don't have to work the next day, I'd also recommend the Tequila Flight, which is $18 for three shots of really good tequila.  Speaking of tequila, they have over 100 kinds!  The only place I've seen come close is El Zocalo in Chandler but I don't think they hit that and they certainly don't have an entire page of a menu devoted to the delicious, cactusy drink.  Skip the food, hit the tequila, and don't plan on making a night out of it because it's often dead."}
{"text":"I have been waiting forever to try this place and I finally got a chance to come! I haven't had a prickly pear margarita since I lived in Tucson, and was excited to try this one. It did not disappoint. I came with some friends during happy hour and we had a wonderful time. Kohl was a great server and super sweet. I opted in for the nachos since all of the apps are half off during happy hour and they were Great! Salsas were also fabulous. Can't wait to continue to try more food and margaritas!! The only suggestion I would make is to put more margaritas on happy hour! There are so many options!"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I've been here, and what a change, not for the better. I usually get the same thing to start with, ceviche and pollo asado. Both are usually quite delicious, not this time.  The ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it. As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible. I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least. Now for the tacos. Stale taco shells, dried and overcooked chicken, slopped on guac and no pico de gallo. The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo, since they did not put any on, and then I was charged $1.00 extra. Of course, no manager was anywhere in sight. This place simply doesn't care. On the bright side, the margaritas and salsa are still good, but the chips were stale.  Not only will I not return, but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town. I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food, and I've always said Cien Agaves. No more."}
{"text":"The tacos are top notch.  I have had most of them and can't pick just one to say it is the best! I do like the fish taco.  The avocado margarita is fantastic as well!  I doubt you can find these in many places."}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot. 1/2 price drinks and appetizers.  Friendly staff nice decor. Small enough to talk and enjoy.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just from walking in you know this place is special. There is an immediate positive atmosphere, the food always comes out right and fast, and the service is exceptional. But if you want to feel at home just sit at the main bar and get yourself silly with a Mexican mule, order 1 or 2 cheese crisps and you'll be set."}
{"text":"Awesome bar and margs. We also got chips and salsa for free because we came in before closing on a Monday and had a nice bartender who hooked us up. Nice menu with tons of options!"}
{"text":"This was such an awful experience. My first time being here and our service was so rude and unprofessional. Our server Conlin was short tempered and did not seem to give a crap about his job. Any request we had or any time he was thanked he just shrugged us off. We kept trying to give him a chance for redemption, but you can only hope for a change so many times. It was busy, so the wait time was totally acceptable, but having my food be wrong, our table forgotten so we could check out and a completely rude server makes me never want to come back again. This is not the place to go for a good time. If you enjoy rude, cold and unprofessional? Sure stop on in."}
{"text":"The decor was the only thing going for this place. Good service and cool design inside gave it the stars, but the food was very mediocre and disappointing as I love a good Al pastor taco... this one had barely any flavor. Have to say the margaritas were pretty blah as well."}
{"text":"Went here for my sisters birthday and was kinda of disappointed in the place. We had a larger party and our servers were so mixed up and didn't come back for our drinks and forgot to bring out our appetizer.  I'm not one to like spicy food and all the food was extremely spicy to me(personally, others at the table said it was great flavor). However, instead of beans I would totally recommend the corn! Also the prickly pear margarita was delish! Great atmosphere and art. I would like to go back with less people and during happy hour!"}
{"text":"BOOM goes the taco dynamite.  My co-workers and I (all of us except the vegetarian, not sure who invited him) thoroughly enjoyed the beef and chicken tacos.  The hard taco shells are the perfect combination of crispy and soft and the toppings were generous.  5 stars, two thumbs up and whatever other positive affirmation you appreciate.   It was a serious work affair, so we didn't get the chance to worked destroy the tequila selection, unfortunately.  Next time Cien Agaves, next time."}
{"text":"March 2018:  GREAT PLACE ... we were there on a Monday night and got seated with no wait (and they were busy).  We ordered margaritas and a beer-rita, a margarita with a beer in it (it was good and only $6 on Monday's).  We all ordered the shrimp tacos ($3 each on Monday's), four shrimp in each taco .... GREAT ... but watch out for the Sauce ... HOT.  Great service and good food.  Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome. I tell everyone I know in the Phoenix area that they neeeed to try this place.  After my last review, Katie reached out to me about the issue with my CC and promised to make things right on my next visit. I am not local to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and really had no plans to come back in the immediate future, so I thanked her for reaching out but didn't really expect much to happen.   Fortunately I got the chance to be in Phoenix for a couple days just a short month later and I knew I would be hitting up Cien Agaves for my tinga chicken quesadilla and house margarita. After sitting down and ordering I mentioned Katie and my server sent her right out - she was awesome and very accommodating and made true on her promise.  I can't speak for the full menu because I literally order the same thing every time (I know - how boring,) but I would expect nothing less than greatness from this place.  The only issues I have are: 1.) I can't go on a regular basis 2.) They don't sell the \"green salsa\" - seriously y'all need to allow me to order this or share the recipe with me because I am obsessed with it.   Thanks again Cien Agaves, I can't wait for my next impromptu Phoenix trip so I can come back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last night after jumping around old town. Nearly everywhere was a 30+ minute wait on a Thursday at 6PM, but thankfully they had bar seats, tables, outside seating and high tops available here.   The bartender was extremely nice and knowledgeable. I asked him if the beans were vegetarian, explaining that I eat fish but not any other meat product. He said that they both were, but was quick to let me know that some other items on my order were not vegetarian and then offer substitutions.   I have never had someone so kind and helpful after asking that question! Even my boyfriend, who has had to deal with my dietary questions at restaurants for years, said he was impressed by how cool he was.   I ended up with two salmon tacos and the street corn. It was one of the greatest, lightest, and freshest Mexican meals I've had in a very long time! This place is fantastic for an array of diners. If you're not that hungry, you can order a single taco or sides.   I can't forget about their extensive margarita and tequila menu! Their house marg is my go-to: perfectly tequila-strong with a splash of lime and sweetness."}
{"text":"My favorite Taco Tuesday in old town! Great shredded beef tacos. Really great deals."}
{"text":"Every Tuesday my girlfriends & I try to go here! They have the best taco's and deal for $1.50 you can't beat them! The staff is always friendly and gives great service! Their house margaritas are surprisingly good too! I would recommend going here any day but especially on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"3-3 1/2 stars is about right. The service was very good, no complaints. The food came out at an appropriate pace and I did not feel rushed at all. I ordered guacamole which was good, not great. Then I got three tacos, two shrimp and one veggie. The menu said the shrimp were hot. I interpreted this to mean spicy. But they were in no way spicy, not even medium. That was disappointing.   My other concern was the outdoor seating. To get a quick seating I agreed to sit outside--they said they had misters and I am really fine with the heat anyway as long as things are shaded. The misters however were pretty extreme. There was a fan blowing a cloud of mist on me the entire time. It was fine at first but got old after a while. Granted I could have requested another seat but I decided to tough it out. But by the end I was honestly a little chilly (yes, in 105 degree weather, amazing to me too).  People who came in after me refused to be seated in the area I was in--they likened it to a rain forest. Note the closer you are to the fan the worse it seems to be.    All in all I was ok with my meal but wonder if I shouldn't have chosen another option in Old Town."}
{"text":"We came here for Happy Hour after leaving the Scottsdale Culinary Festival. It was within walking distance of the Festival, in the shopping district. I got the Sangria and Regular Margarita. The Sangria was ok, not enough fruit at the bottom. The Margarita was good."}
{"text":"Great dinner. Fish tacos were tasty.  Guac was also good.  Chill ambiance.  Siobhan was a great server - very attentive and always with a smile. Will be back."}
{"text":"So fun, really love sitting at the bar hanging out with crazy drunk locals. The tacos are terrific and \"The Local\" margarita in a pint glass is the way to go.  Marisa loves the ceviche too."}
{"text":"The waitress apparently preferred serving my male companion. The food came out cold. She kept mixing beverages up.  Poor service. Decent food served cold. Sexist waitress.  Just come here to drink, not have a good time."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience just now at Cien. We are in town from St Louis and were craving Mexican. Got to Cien around 8:35. Hostess told us the only 2 top table was upstairs and \"feel free to go up there.\" We sit at an open table. 5 min later a server asks us if we were seated there, we told her hostess said pick a table. She said we need to go back downstairs to tell the hostess we sat there? So we did. Hostess said \"ok great.\" Didn't give us menus or any further direction. No more acknowledgment from the server back upstairs. So we moved to a high top (it was dirty but only one available) thinking the bartender would serve us there. A busser got the dishes from the table and we were still not acknowledged by any server. At this point it was 8:55 and we decided to leave. No waters, no menus, no acknowledgment. Honestly pretty unbelievable."}
{"text":"Whenever anyone asks me to recommend a great Happy Hour spot in Old Town Scottsdale, Cien Agaves is always on the list! It is right in the heart of Old Town and walking distance from so many fun things to do! Their margaritas & guac are to die for!! It is EVERY DAY, yes, even Saturday & Sunday! ...from 3 PM - 7 PM {I love that it runs until 7 PM, in case your work day runs extra long!} Honestly, what more could you ask for?   HH Specials:  1/2 Price Appetizers  1/2 off Cien Agaves Margaritas  $2 Tinga Tacos  $3 Dos Equis Lager & Amber"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by Groupon, and couldn't say no because I am such a big fan of Margaritas. It was a great place for lunch with some friends. It's probably great for dinner with a few friends, too. Service was okay, not spectacular but acceptable. I wouldn't recommend walking in with a large group unless you called ahead (if you can) because they don't seem like they could quickly get stuff situated for you.  I had a breaded lobster taco, shredded beef taco, and Prickly Pear Margarita. My friend had the same, but with a POM-rita instead of the Prickly Pear Margarita. All the Margaritas here are made with fresh ingredients (fresh-squeezed limes, etc.) and not some mixes that have been sitting in bottles in the fridge forever. I honestly like the POM-rita better than the Prickly Pear Margarita, but they were both very good and quite large. However, the Margaritas are really expensive. I would recommend coming during happy hour because they are all half-price during happy hour. Plus, appetizers are half-price then, too. And on Mondays, the house margarita is only $3.00 ALL DAY long. I'll definitely be back for some happy hour margaritas and on a Monday off. As for the Tacos, the breaded lobster taco was really disappointing. The sauce they put on it didn't pair that well with the fried lobster, and the pieces of lobster were overcooked and a bit too chewy/dry for my tastes. However, The shredded beef taco was AMAZING. After I started eating the shredded beef taco, I knew I would be coming back for more of them. It's just a classic shredded beef taco with the classic trimmings in a crunchy taco shell (the shell seemed like it was fried very close to when I ate it, yet wasn't oily and they didn't salt it), but they must be doing something a little different because it was just too damn good.   To sum up, I will be back and definitely recommend this place, but if you want to drink margaritas with some of those awesome shredded beef tacos, I would stick to Happy Hour, because the prices are pretty steep.  **Edit: Just found out from a fellow Yelper that they have $1.00 shredded beef tacos on tuesdays. That just moved it from 4 stars to 5 in my book and I will probably spend way too many tuesdays here. Thanks, Lindsey!"}
{"text":"Cien Agaves! What can I say? I love fish tacos (tacos pescados) and this well established eatery has several choices. The Tecate Fish Tacos (crispy, beer battered fish) were tasty.  My favorite moments, however, were watching the little birds scour the outdoor seating area for tortilla chip crumbs and listening to the lively banter of the interesting couple that sat near me."}
{"text":"Great margaritas and a nice happy hour, but was not impressed with the food. We had to ask for the free chips and salsa, and the tacos were just blah"}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican spot. I had the fajita bowl with chicken added in. Would've liked more rice, corn and gauc instead of tons of beans and bell peppers personally. Normally get the chimichanga and nachos. Definitely recommend those. Friendly staff and great margaritas. Definitely recommend the Bobs Blue Hawaiian or prickly pear margarita. Nice place for a date or with friends/family."}
{"text":"Te, Te, Te, tequila... Margarita! Holy heaven Cien Agave has the best margaritas in town.  Hottie and I decided to take a seat on the patio during Sunday happy hour to enjoy the Arizona sunshine.  We weren't planning on eating, but after seeing the food being served we decided to give their tacos and some guacamole a try.  I had a veggie taco on a flour tortilla.  It was excellent; they actually grilled up the veggies and the tortilla, giving it the nice crunch of a taco without the frying.  The guacamole was just okay; I've had better and can definitely make a better batch at home.   A good Mexican food restaurant typically has a solid chips and salsa presentation, but their salsa was weak and had gringo written all over it! I'm glad I ended up ordering a taco, because it gave me a better peek into their menu.  We will definitely be back for Happy hour; you can't get a rockin' $3.50 margarita and $2 taco anywhere else in Old Town!"}
{"text":"This place is off the hizzie for shizzie. Great HH, Great drinks, the most amazing Salsa. This place has it all. Would definitely recommend to a friend, a friend of a friend and even my grandma.   Thank you Cien Agave for deliciousness every step of the way"}
{"text":"I went to Cien Agaves for the first time during a trip to Scottsdale, AZ for a friend's rehearsal dinner. I went to Cien Agaves for the second time, the very next day, because this place is so good!  Coming from Upstate NY, I put all my hopes for a good mexican meal during my short trip to AZ in this place. It is loud in here, with the latest top 40 music playing throughout its two floors. There is an outside patio where you can eat tacos outside enjoying the desert air and a $2 taco tuesday.  The shredded beef tacos were completely addicting and I loved that they dotted the guacamole with little pomegranate seeds (so much healthier!). The tortillas were those homemade corn tortillas that you yearn for in the Eastern states. For my friend's rehearsal dinner, they made mini churros that they turned into a fine display. I'm a sucker for mini churros.  This place is great for a quick mexican platter while passing through Scottsdale. If you are interested in using it for a party, it was definitely one of the best mexican buffet style experiences that I have ever tried. I would definitely come back during my next visit."}
{"text":"Cien Agaves Tacos & Tequila does just a couple of things, but they do them really well!  We tried a range of items (blackberry mojito, local margarita, nachos, tacos, rice, beans) but the real stars were - not surprisingly - the tacos and the tequila.   The local margarita is made with a locally-made tequila, and this was one of the best margaritas I've ever had. And the tacos? Nom, nom, nom. We had beef, carnitas, and chicken - and they were all winners. The nachos were okay, and the beans and rice were pretty standard fare.  Our server, Meg, was awesome. She made great recommendations and she totally took good care of us - making sure our food was good and that our drinks stayed full.  And the price? Totally reasonable for the amount of food and all the local ingredients."}
{"text":"I've only been to Cien Agaves once, and it was Cinco de Mayo, so I understandably don't have a good grasp on their day-to-day operations.  However, in a city that is filled to the gills with rip-off, overcrowded, overpriced cantinas on Cinco, Cien Agaves was a breath of fresh air.  We were there in the afternoon with a large group of 20.  We received good service the entire time, cheap and tasty cocktails, and very good tacos.  In my book, that's 3 for 3."}
{"text":"Ventured through a few of the apps most are 3-4 Guac...is a must order, it's always freshly made and if you're lucky or unlucky depending on your spice tolerance you might get an occasional spicy surprise not sure what variety of pepper that was but definitely kicked it up a few notches however the pomegranate seeds balance it out nicely."}
{"text":"I went to taco Tueday last night and started off with a house margarita for half price during happy hour. ($4)  It was very fresh and tart you could tell they didnt use sweet and sour, which is a good thing.  I ordered 2 shredded beef tacos and the Guacamole. The apps are half off also during happy hr which is till 6 pm.  The tortilla chips are A-Maz-Ing, delish.. the red salsa is pretty fab too. The guac is a NO WAY JOSE'. Doesn't taste like fresh avocados, tastes like processed green mush. the tacos were decent they come with shredded cabbage, cheese, sour cream and shredded beef for 1.50 each on Tues all night. I prob wont return didnt really make that great of an impression."}
{"text":"Close to 5 stars.    Food was good, I went w the 3 taco plate.  Battered fish, carnitas and el pastor .  My wife had hashtag veggie bowl w chicken, which she loved.  Staff was on the move and service was quick & solid."}
{"text":"If you're a tequila fan, this is the place for you. Fortunately for me, I have enough sobriety that I was able to breeze past the beckoning of my former friend the agave plant and head straight for the fresh shrimp ceviche with perfectly ripe avocado slices.  The fajita salad did not disappoint, featuring amazingly tender, smoky beef and fresh veggies in an addictively airy tortilla bowl. I ordered the creamy jalapeno dressing, which was a little bit. In retrospect, I would have also ordered the creamy cilantro and mixed the two.  Our server was friendly and appropriately attentive, and we overheard other servers delivering similarly great service.  Only reason for 4 stars was the outdoor dining area was a little plain and dirty, a busboy was smoking outside near the tables, and the inside was overstimulating. But for a tequila bar, maybe those are five-star conditions."}
{"text":"This place was delish! And ironically, it has a happy hour that actually has happy hour prices. I know that sounds funny, but a lot of happy hours are almost just as expensive as regulars prices. But this place is yummy and tasty! 4 house Margis, two tacos, guacamole and tostadas for under $30 bucks. Pretty good! We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Green salsa was good but little else was.    Sosa was flat, tacos were dry and tasted like they were just reheated from the night before.   Service was slow as well.   I won't be returning and they 5 people I was with stated the same.   Very sad."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of Cien Agaves. The place has a really cool feel. There is an upstairs (more traditional tables) and a downstairs (bar and high tops). There is a great happy hour menu and a large selection of margaritas. Chips and salsa, guacamole, and queso are really good. The salad I had was only so so, but my party ordered tacos for the most part which looked amazing! Parking can be a little tricky depending on the time of day since it is in the heart of Old Town, but well worth a visit if your in the mood for a Southwest vibe."}
{"text":"The tacos were so tasteless and we did not get a good service. The waitresses were so confused and stressed."}
{"text":"Great Saturday night vibe. Beer-Rita's are a must! Bring all of your friends. Service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"3 Stars only because the house margarita and guacamole was so good.  The food was decent (fish tacos), however the patio atmosphere was a bit sad. I understand this is more of a bar than a fine dining restaurant but the patio tables had no place settings, condiments, etc... Just cheap metal tables and chairs. Also - there was no music out there, just this incessant humming of a back alley generator.    The service was a bit sporadic out on the patio as well. We were asked by three different servers if we have a server yet. Not much in the way of organization.   Maybe management just hasn't gotten around to fully organizing and furnishing the patio yet. I hope they do, because they are in a great location and the food and drinks give them lots of potential."}
{"text":"Go on Tuesdays!  They have $1 tacos... just be sure to have them clarify which ones; not all of them are a $1.  I have been here twice so far and the service the first time was attentive... the second time my waitress seemed a little spacey but got the job done:).  Today I decided to try their house made guacamole which was very tasty and their chips and salsas are not to be missed.  So far I have only tried their shredded beef taco and the chorizo and potato taco... they both were really good.  I have not had a chance to try a margarita yet because I have only been during work... but a see a happy hour in my future and Cien Agave:)."}
{"text":"This place rocks on Tuesdays with $1 tacos and cheap drinks.  Try the Lobster Sampler Platter (if you're not going for the $1 tacos on Tuesdays).  Chips and Salsa and right on, everyone friendly, ok for kids in the restaurant section.  Has a little patio, and an upstair couchy loungey bar area (never been there for drinking, but I did sneak upstairs with my son to check out the layout -- it's a habit I have of pacing out real estate!).  Would be a perfect place to rent out for a party or event, probably holds like 40 seated, standing room for another 30 or so)."}
{"text":"Looking for amazing flavor, this is the place. Great food amazing prices and large portions. Their pico is amazing. Great place to eat! Really good salsa also. Try it. You will Like it."}
{"text":"I read great reviews about this place, but sadly I was misled. Everything here was a miss. Bad service (it took an hour to get a simple order of guacamole), mediocre food and worst of all substandard margaritas, which is a surprise given the name of the place. An off night perhaps?"}
{"text":"Granted, they did take our reservation for 20 just several hours before we were to arrive.....and we did bring in a group of 20 to have dinner and drinks.  Still, the service and food left a lot to be desired.    The two waitress (for our large group) lacked personalities.  The food took foreverrrr......which would seem like a good time to sell some margaritas, but we had to ask for seconds.  Then the food came out, and my rice was cold.    Still, my black bean burrito was good and they kept the chips and salsa flowing and split the checks nicely.   Next time, I'll come with a smaller group."}
{"text":"I used to think this place deserved at least 4 stars but with the new happy hour specials (1/2 off appetizers and margharitas, 1.50 some kinda shredded meat taco that you can get at Juliobertos for a buck Mon-Wed) its gone down to a meh..  Their soda fountain is never calibrated right and now you have to request the complimentary chips and salsa.  Definitely not my favorite anymore!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good margaritas and a fun atmosphere this is definitely the place. The food isn't spectacular, it's sized right for the price.  I had ordered the Poki  bowl and the only thing that actually had flavor was the tuna, everything else in it was pretty bland.  Very cool place for HH though!"}
{"text":"We had our daughters rehearsal dinner here. It was such a great experience! The managers did everything to accommodate our needs before the event, including gluten free options for a few guests. Any questions that I emailed to them were answered promptly. And I have to say, this was not the case with other places. We had the upstairs and our own bar. The food was hot, abundant, and wonderful!! If you have a large party,this is the place to go. The price was great too!"}
{"text":"This was disappointing.   Service was very slow.   The food mediocre.   The \"steak\" burrito had a lot of rice.  But there was very little meat.   The street corn is served cold.  I wouldn't ever come back here again."}
{"text":"Great tequila options is the highlight. Unfortunately all four of our orders were just blah. We had to send one meal back as the ahi bowl was swimming in soy sauce. Another meal lathered in cheese. I rarely find a meal that prompts me to give a subpart review. Disappointed to find such poor Mexican in Arizona."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you have a big group, or are hoping for deep conversation. It's pretty small, pretty cramped, and the music is always blaring a few notches too loud.  That said, the food isn't bad for trendy Mexican, and is incredibly veggie friendly (NOT vegan friendly), which I appreciate. Both their red sauce and their tomato sauce, as well as both salsa, both beans and their rice, are all 100% vegetarian. That's incredibly hard to find here in Arizona.  I love the basics; the cheese enchiladas are what bring me back. I've deviated twice; once for the fajitas, and once for the chilie relleno.  Both were ok, but nothing to write home about. My partner devours the chimichanga, and says it's one of the best she's had. Oddly enough, neither of us have tried the tacos, which is what they're known for. Perhaps next time!"}
{"text":"Just came from a restaurant that didn't even want to serve me and went to agaves tacos and tequila and had a great Atmosphere and great customer service they  knowledge me right away with big smiles and a welcoming greeting You guys are the best"}
{"text":"5 stars for taking great care of our big group of 12. I figured that service for so many people would take forever. Definitely not--drinks came out quick, food didn't take too long, and I didn't see a single wrong order.   Our waitress was awesome. She had great suggestions (get the cheese crisp with carnitas for an appetizer--yum!). She also had no problem with me asking for my mango margarita on the rocks instead of frozen.  Highly recommended for a group."}
{"text":"Food was great, atmosphere and service was fantastic. Meal prices are very reasonable ! Definite recommendation and will return!"}
{"text":"I love tacos and Cien Agaves has so many too choose from and they're all amazing!! The margaritas are also to die for!"}
{"text":"I went in Tuesday looking for a new Taco Tuesday spot and definitely found my new place. It was delicious and my buddy and I had a great time . The food was delicious and the beer cold. A super solid selection of tequilas turned a great meal into a definite danger will robinson night. All around a wonderful time and the bartender (I think her name was Michael Ann) was hilarious. I will be back on Tuesdays and any other time I need some tacos and wonderful times. Kudos Cien, you have a new regular!"}
{"text":"This place is tho!!! GREAT tacos. Fajitas are the best! Margaritas..yummmm. The green salsa is my absolute favorite (tomatillo). I have been coming here for 5+ years now. The food has NEVER let me down. One of the owners is usually on site and you can tell they care about their product. I have recommended this place to numerous out of town friends, and they have always enjoyed the experience.   They have an upstairs area that you can rent out for special events. The atmosphere is perfect for larger parties and fun occasions like graduation parties, work events, wedding showers, etc.  We have rented the space and utilized their catering menu a few times and they have always been very helpful with each event. Very accommodating! Warm staff! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place in Old Town Scottsdale!  The food is great, the service is good and it is in a good location!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Tacos and Tequila was yesterday.  I seated myself in the bar and was greeted by a very cordial bartender who took my order. I ordered two carne asada tacos, beans and rice which was $11.50 The bartender brought chips, a red salsa & a green salsa. The green salsa was very good.   When my tacos arrived I was very disappointed.  Each flour tortilla had about two tablespoons of meat in it and nothing else. No guacamole or salsa fresca. The rice was kind of just glopped on the plate and the beans were very bland, they tasted like they had no salt or seasonings at all.  The plate presentation was one of the worst I have ever seen and I just felt that whoever made the plate had no love of cooking.  I will not go back. I will say that had anyone asked me how the food was I would have told them how I felt about it... but no one asked."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised....Charming decor, good vibe, I was glad they had healthier options- my Beets by Cien were AWESOME & guilt-free!!!! My mum enjoyed her Ceviche after adding more lime juice and the red & green salsas were very tasty.  Will def try again..."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays should not be missed!  Great tacos, beer and tequila offered for very reasonable prices.  It was our first time in Cien Agaves, pity we had not found it before now.  The staff could not have been more friendly, fun and accommodating!  It is worth the drive from the west valley."}
{"text":"Meh. Was close to the hotel so we thought we'd give it a try. I'm sure my rating would be higher if I drank. Service was good, inside was noisy, salsa and chips were good, food was ok."}
{"text":"I've given Cien Agaves three chances now and they just haven't provided me with anything that makes me to try them again.  I've had the veggie tacos, the fish tacos, chips, salsa, beer and the chips, salsa and beer were pretty good.  This past visit the service was good so that raised it to two stars.  If you are a friend of mine and you want me to come to a happy hour or lunch, do not pick this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place for HH but for dinner on the weekends it can be a pain to find parking... pretty typical mexican with good margaritas... no need for me to reinvent the wheel since i feel the same as most of the other reviewers"}
{"text":"How have I lived in Oldtown for my entire life and never been here?  This is hands down the best Mexican happy hour in Scottsdale.  Tried it for the first time yesterday.  For $19, this is what my friend and I got: A margarita, a dos equis, nachos, and a quesadilla.  The nachos were huge and they used real cheddar cheese (not the soupy sauce).  The quesadilla was equally large, and tasted great.  Their complimentary chips and salsa had a great salsa verde, although I didn't much care for the red salsa.  Service was outstanding.  Non happy hour prices were on par with other Mexican joints, but I rarely see too much on happy hour at other Mexican restaurants.    I will definitely be back when I can get off work and make it down here before 7!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out for the first time the other day and the margaritas were amazing! I highly recommend the habanero margarita. Tacos are delicious too. I wish I had more of an appetite to try the rest of the menu. Service was great! Mimi was our server and she was so funny and really went above and beyond. I will be back and I will recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Cien Agaves is one of my favorite places to go in the Old Town Scottsdale area, and definitely stands out to me as one of the best spots to go to for Mexican food and tacos :) the service has always been great, and it's in a great location -- just a little bit off the main Scottsdale road.  As for the food, I can't say enough good things! They actually offer complimentary chips and salsa (I don't think enough places do anymore), and the salsa is delicious! Their Queso Verde appetizer is a must-have as well, my boyfriend and I tried it our first time here, and we have never not ordered it since. We love queso in general, but the slow roasted green chile pork they add is amazing :)   I will say that the tacos here are a bit expensive, most are $4-$5 each. They're much better quality here than most taco places though, and are served with a ton of meat and cheese, not just filled with lettuce. My boyfriend and I have tried a ton of different ones, and they've all been really good. I also really like to order the Fajita Bowl with Chicken, I think this is the best way to get a lot for your money. The bowl is only $7 and comes with a ton of rice and veggies, and it's only $2-$5 to add meat.   I definitely recommend trying this place if you're looking for Mexican food! Happy hour lasts till 7 which is nice for after work, and there's a ton of free parking. If you can't find a space right in front, there's a huge public lot not too far down the street."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time as a part of a Yelp event for new hires. My friend Amanda just got hired so I was especially excited to be able to share the experience with her. We went during the afternoon, and it had a very laid back vibe, which I really enjoyed. I only had a beer and some tacos (which were AMAZING!) so my overall experience was somewhat limited. But in the short time i spent there I was definitely impressed, and will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I got the carnita burrito that was huge. It could have had more meat inside but it was still good. The salsa is tasty as well. My buddy got three tacos and said it was really good. The atmosphere is great as well."}
{"text":"I only ate 3 things at Cien Agaves so that is was this following review is based on.  1. The chips and salsa are great. People were saying it was too watery, but I disagree it was extremely flavorful with great chips.  2. The classic margarita is 100% perfect. Not only was the taste perfect but they didn't wimp out on the tequila. The color was spot on.   3. The carne asada taco. One word, delicious. I think this might be the best taco is the valley. Everywhere I go I try their carne asada taco, and this place was by far the best. I am just unhappy it took me this long to find Cien!!!  I will return."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Great drinks and tacos."}
{"text":"Made it just in time for happy hour. Happy hour is from 4-7 EVERY night.   Our fantastic server Anne recommended a Tequila. Maybe the best Tequila I have ever had the chance to taste:  Herradura Cien Agaves Single Barrel Reposado    Ask for it cold!***"}
{"text":"Me and a group of 9 friends decided to come check this place out before our movie! It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks that we were never ID'd for after ordering and our waitress mixed all of our margaritas up. I didn't catch her name as she never introduced herself. It was a young black girl serving upstairs. By the time the food came out some of us were missing tacos, shrimp, sides, etc and all of our waters were empty!! We asked the bartender to grab us water and he did promptly.  the food was absolutely delicious!! I was very impressed. I wish we had more time to enjoy but the service was so slow that we were late for the movie.  Our server was standing at the POS for 10-15 minutes trying to get our checks but my friends grew so frustrated that they lined up in efforts to pay so she would stop getting distracted. I then watched her whisper to the bartender how \"annoying\" we were. What's really annoying is having poor service ruin an entire meal that was so promising. Keep up the good work, chefs!"}
{"text":"Cien Agaves is a great option for good food and good vibes.  The thing that sticks out to me is how consistent they are.  Like it's always good, never bad.  I love their tacos, and fajitas. Chips and Salsa is FREE praise the LawD!!!!!  Cien Agaves keep doing what you do, thanks for being someone I can count on!"}
{"text":"THE BEST! My friends and I have been coming here for a of couple years and it is hands down our favorite spot, especially for nice spring/summer days eating outside on the patio. The decor is great and the music is always perfect for the atmosphere.  The cucumber margarita is a must try and you can easily fill up on the chips and salsa.  I don't eat meat but my friends love the tinga tacos and I am a fan of the veggie tacos and fajitas. The guacamole and nachos are also great! They have a vast selection of tequilas and a tequila hall of fame.  If you want to make the hall of fame just ask the bartender how and they'll give you all the details. It's a great way to explore and find your favorite tequila.  They also have lots of events and specials like taco tuesdays and margarita mondays.  I take all friends and family from out of town here and if/when I move, this will be the place I miss and crave the most! :)"}
{"text":"I was craving some good Mexican food. This place delivered had great burritos and tacos and lots of choices with all the drinks"}
{"text":"There is lots to love about this place, and I want to start with the service, attentive, friendly, and gracious. Our servers took such great care of our big table on monday night, that I have to give the place 5 stars before even one plate of food was served.  About the food we planned the visit around Cien Agaves terrific Happy hour, so there were lots of tico tacos $1.50 ea and half price appitizers on the table, rounded out by a few entrees. Everything I tasted was delicious, especially the Chicken Quesidilla. Normally I would skip a chicken Quesidill on almost any menu, but I am so glad I didnt this time. Just the right mix of seasoned Chipotle Chicken and Cheese in a huge folded and grilled tortilla, with sour cream. This is by far the very best restaurant quesidilla in town. Everything served was great, and raves about the food came frome everyone.  They have great drink specials during happy hour as well, including 1/2 price margaritas and special priced beers. It's the tequilla selection that is special though. It's an amazing selection of some of the best tequillas in the world. You can even try some tequilla flights!  Inside the place is funky/cool, super clean, with some really cool art and lighting. In Old Town There are some real GEMS and a few DUDS when it comes to mexican food, but Cien Agaves might just be the very best choice for Mexican food in Scottsdale.  I MUST SAY TO MY FELLOW YELPERS---GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly, airy place. Modest menu, ok quality, spotty service, ok prices according to the people I was with. LOUD. I mean LOUD. Don't go there if you want to have a conversation."}
{"text":"A little taste of mexico in old town!  And we all know how I love mexico!  Good everything, service has always been great, and I love their happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"I first came here many years ago and remembered the happy hour food was good, so on a recent trip back to Scottsdale, I was in need of some good food but didn't know where to turn. I was one block away from Cien Agaves, so I came back to try it again. I got the two taco special with soft flour shell and carne asada. Comes with typical beans and rice. These are without a doubt the most flavorful tacos I've ever had. It's like a taste explosion! I think some of that comes from the fresh guacamole they put on the tacos.  All their other food looked great too, and people seem to love it.  Definitely give it a try. There's a reason they've been here in business so long!"}
{"text":"Got invited here by a friend who just started working here....was really busy do we sat at the bar. The queso was amazing. Had pork in it. Not really a pork guy but it was tasty!! Damn good. The steak burrito with green chili was also really good. I can usually finish my plate but today I did not! Great portion size! Kenzie was our waiter. Awesome and patient with all our questions! Great first impression. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a good spot for happy hour.  Tuesdays are taco Tuesdays, so you can eat for a reasonable price for the entire family.  Service isn't the greatest, but overall, it is a place that we would return to."}
{"text":"Cien Agaves was a chill place to have a margarita after work, kick back with the locals and get to know the staff.  The rating is more like a 4.5.     The tasty seared ahi taco inspired this haiku:  I walk across sand And find myself sweltering In need of a drink  The salty rim calls My dry mouth is quickly quenched As Richard brings chips  The local spouts off And teaches new crude phrases As the staff shakes heads  Margarita three Thoughts of a supposed friend prompt melancholy  Then regulars laugh the seared ahi taco arrives culinary hug"}
{"text":"AVOID THE TEQUILA TASTING. Unless you really just want shots (not tasting), standing in long lines,  and being surrounded by copious amounts of drunken twenty-somethings.   I bought a \"Google Offers\" for tequila tasting for myself and a friend. I had called to see how it was ran and what to expect. I was told it was similar to a wine tasting experience. LOL! We went upstairs to the bar area, where two elongated utility tables were out. There were two representatives offering (approximately) two ounce shots in small, plastic \"sauce\" cups. Which, by the way, we never did experience.  We gave up and left after waiting (standing) in line for fifteen minutes. It was more aligned with a keg party.  Not that we were upset, since instead of a sipping and a true tequila experience, we were really in the middle of a \"free shot\" until you get really, really drunk experience.  We left and headed over to the grapevine instead. Excellent patio, decent cocktails, (unfortunately a poor tequila selection, but that's not what they are known for).   I do have to say, the manager was kind in an email, but we won't be visiting here again.  I can't comment on the food. 1 star for misrepresenting what they are offering, 4 stars for management. 5 stars to Google Offers for giving me a full refund without any issues."}
{"text":"What a great lunch! Walking around old town and discovered this Mexican place! Fantastic fajitas and Cadillac margaritas. The guacamole was pretty good, needed a bit more flavor. Samantha C did a great job as our waitress! We will be back on our next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place with Prickly Pear Margaritas but saw the Mai Tai on the menu and had to order it. Yummy. Had several appetizers which were Happy Hour specials. All good but served on the lukewarm side."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly waiters and cool atmosphere. The prickly pear margarita is really good and so is the fajita bowl! Definitely worth stopping by for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Would I go back here if/when I return to Scottsdale? Heck yeah!!!!!  When we were there last November there were 5 adults and one child in our family group wandering around the area looking for something to eat.  The one place we tried to get into you couldn't get in without a crowbar so we wandered past this, took a look at the menu and said why not!  So glad we did!  Good sangria, interesting patio area (felt more like an alley but cool), great chips and salsa, and good food at a good price.  No one, not even the kid complained about their food.  And this was the first time in my life I had fajitas with zucchini in them! YUM!  Plus, most veggies that come with fajitas are usually limp beyond limp and on the bland side.  Theirs had some spice to them.    With drinks and food our whole bill for all of us was around 100$.  Not bad for a place in Old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Poorly mixed margaritas, which is weird when you consider that is supposedly the house special. There is no raw fish taco anywhere in Mexico, unless you don't have a fire. We didn't get quite what we ordered. First and last time there."}
{"text":"Visiting from New York we wanted something 'authentic' to Arizona while walking around Old Town Scottsdale and this place seemed to fit the bill.  I ordered the Fajita Bowl.  On 'paper' it didn't seem like anything amazing - rice, beans, citrus marinade grilled veggies and guacamole on top - but it was vegetarian and seemed filling so I went for it.  This is an example of where a humble meal, prepared well, ends up besting something else that's got a sexier name or more exotic ingredients.  It was perfectly seasoned, with just enough 'heat', everything tasted fresh, the rice and black beans were soft, the grilled veggies REALLY did have a marvelous citrusy lemon-lime flavor and the guac provided a lovely counterbalance to the heat of the dish.  Healthy, tasty,with a texture that was both chewy and soft.  Perfect and at $7, it seemed like the best deal in town.  You can order it with some protein on top for a bit more too.  The services was friendly and atmosphere very SouthWestern.  If I was local, this would become a regular thing."}
{"text":"Excellent food, super service!! Best guacamole ever!!!  Waiter was quick to come by and add water to our glasses and check if we needed anything. I strongly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Ordered:  al pastor, shredded beef & carne asada (& churro sundae) A+ for all 3!  The pineapple in the al pator blended great with the smokey taste of the pork.  Both beef tacos were superb.  We wanted to try the spicy shrimp one, but decided to save room for the CHURRO sundae : ) YUM! and good thing we did - it was excellent! BF liked the green sauce more, it was sweeter.  On the flip side I preferred the red sauce - it was a bit spicier, and a real treat since I normally ALWAYS prefer green salsa. Also got the grilled corn which was a bit of a let down - it seemed boiled, not grilled, but oh well.  They have lots of specials and if it were later on the evening (as opposed to the early lunch when we were there) we probably would have sampled some of their tequilas/margaritas. Would definitely go back/recommend. Service was great too - no complaints!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food! Highly recommend this spot in old town scottsdale for happy hour or dinner!!"}
{"text":"Had a fun dinner with coworkers on their Taco Tuesday, which can be a great deal with $2 chicken tinga tacos, half off their house margs and half off appetizers. Now, none of us partook in those deals (hello, expense account), but we still loved our dinners! Most of us did their two taco plate with beans (refried or black) and Spanish rice, but you could do three tacos, 10 or even 30 for $38, or something like that. You can also pick flour or corn tortillas. They had 20 or so funky taco choices so it was hard to narrow down, but I tried their seared ahi taco with chipotle jicama slaw and avocado as well as their spicy shrimp taco with rice and guajillo sauce ($4.95 each). Guajillo peppers are my jam and though the rice sounded weird on the menu, it worked, but maybe needed an additional sauce to jazz it up and make it less dry. I had an amazing habanero lime marg ($12), okay two margs, but they had a ton of options including cucumber, other fruits, beer margs with a bottle out the top and even skinny versions. Other meals on the menu included fajitas, enchiladas, salads, quesadillas and some yummy sounding bowls like the \"beets by Cien\" which, in addition to two colors of beets, also has shaved Brussels sprouts, chimichurri sauce and dried cranberries I think (could add proteins like chicken, steak, shrimp or salmon). Lively joint with two floors and lots of color inside. Great service that handled our large party spread across two tables and got us out in time for our next activity. Fun area in cute Old Town!"}
{"text":"We are from Portland, Oregon and spent a week in Scottsdale during December 2013.  Of the 7 nights we dinned out, we went to Cien Agaves 4 nights.  Everything is absolutely excellent- including the service, prices and especially the quality of the food and drinks (the Happy Hour food menu and drinks are fantastic!).   The atmosphere and seating offer something for everyone.  Indoors for the music and energy, outdoors for the wonderful desert air and a little more quiet while enjoying the warm heaters.  My only regret:  that Cien Agaves is not in my own city!  Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had the tacos on special.  Yum... good stuff.  But they really felt like \"cheap\" tacos.  They arrived a bit wet and could not be picked up with your hand without ripping through the tortilla.  Guacamole was good.    Dining area was okay.  A bit loud.  I will probably be back, but mostly because the price is right."}
{"text":"1 + 1 + 1 = 4  Sometimes, like at Cien Agaves, the sum of the parts adds up to more than each individual part.    Mexican food was on the minds of my party of 4 and the first place we tried claimed an hour-plus wait despite appearing 10% full.  It was a blessing in disguise really, as Cien Agaves was much more what we sought:  a busy casual environment,  inexpensive fare, zero pretension, and no attitude.    During a brief wait at their upstairs bar, we learned it was Happy Hour and that theirs was voted \"best of\" by readers of Phoenix Magazine.  How could it not, with 1/2 price Margaritas, 1/2 off all appetizers, $3-$4 beers, and Tinga Tacos priced at $2.50 apiece?  The fact that it's every day from 3 - 7 p.m. just improves the value proposition.    Margaritas were in demand and many sat pre-made, at the ready.  Large but not refined (and made in advance without salted rims), I really wasn't going to complain loudly about a big $3 cocktail.  It was good enough, a category into which the rest of the offerings could also be said to fall.    At the table, chips and salsa were provided and an order of HH Tinga Tacos proved greasily satisfying.  The rest of the offerings followed suit.  During happy hour it's difficult to resist all those cheap appetizers so I can't really complain about them serving up fatty foods best designed to sop up alcohol.  It is, after all, what I ordered.    Cien Agaves doesn't serve the best Mexican fare but what they do serve - at happy hour in particular - is well priced, good at filling you up, and your server will throw no shade even when your whole party orders from that happy hour menu.  That counts for a lot, thus the new math, where 1+1+1 = 4."}
{"text":"Chicken tinga tacos were delicious. Great happy hour prices. The Local margarita was made with fresh limes and a very smooth tequila. The chips and salsa were very fresh."}
{"text":"Last night was my third time to this fresh and well-spirited (both figuratively and literally) tequila bar. It has not disappointed...  Aside from the pretty but grumpy hostess, I have nothing but praise and accolades. The tacos have been amazing each time, the fajitas had that smell that just makes you inhale and savor, and the tequila collection is probably the best I've seen - over 100, mostly high end blancos, repos, anejos and even some of the best (still in production) XAs around. 100 tequilas in a year and you're considered royalty with a picture on the bar and happy hour pricing for life - if you're from Phoenix why aren't you already there? Heck, I only come into town now and then but I'm aiming high. Like I said, the best shelf around.   The servers have been super friendly and attentive, the 'tenders each time have stopped mixing just long enough to say \"hey\" when we walked in. I'm giving the service 4.9 stars (just that hostess that one time...)  Parking is easy, the place is fun. If you haven't come for a tequila pour yet, you're missing out.  \"DJ 1942 neat, please?\""}
{"text":"It's a cool place! More for the kiddie crowd. Everyone trying to be all like that! Cool, or \"I'm the most beautiful girl in the world\" mode! Wife and I started with the Los Nachos, This was my favorite of the night! Chips piled up high with black beans, chicken, pablabo sauce and cheese! I ordered their Al Pastor tacos, wife had their beef tacos. Al Pastor was just OK, if you ever had Al Pastor, you know what kind of explosive flavor it should have! This one didn't!! Wife's taco was actually better then mine! It had shredded beef that was soaked in its juice, in a fried shell. Very good taco. Tacos come with beans and rice. Rice wasn't that good, tasted like it came out of the box. Beans had no flavor, NOTE!! Black beans were a lot better!!! We also shared a prickly pear margarita, very strong! (glad we shared it!!) I have had better. We had a good time, service was great all away around! If I was back in the area, I could see myself going there again."}
{"text":"The tacos are the best thing on the menu and reasonably priced. Get at least two, and probably three of you have a big appetite. The sangria is excellent and is freshly made with crushed fruit."}
{"text":"Art is amazing ... 100 % Puro Moises. Food is barely edible. Margs are watered down sugary mess. Was excited about the green chile cheese crisp with carnitas which the waitresses recommended but the green chile had zero favor. Overall a disappointment."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite margarita place in Scottadale and possibly even the valley! Their tequila selection is incredible, so much to chose from. If you are a tequila lover like me, check out Cien Agave!"}
{"text":"I loved this little place in Old Town Scottsdale!! Such a fun vibe. They have a great happy hour every day with half off all appetizers and house margaritas. The margarita was delicious!! I had the ceviche to start which was good but the Ensalada Del Mar salad was amazzzzzing. I topped it with grilled salmon and the chipotle vinaigrette dressing. Although the waitresses had zero personality the service was super fast. Highly suggest stopping by if ever in the area. Such a fun and cute place"}
{"text":"Please give this restaurant a try. You will not be disappointed. I had the Mahi-mahi Burrito Bowl and it was delicious. Try The Local and The Cadillac Margaritas. Siobhan B. Is a great waitress. She was nice and made great food and drink recommendations. It's good"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Their mango tango margarita was delicious! Staff was nice. Food was great. I didn't make it on time for their happy hour when I was in town this time. Prices for drink wasn't bad without happy hour. I did get to peak at thier happy hour menu and I would deffinetly recommend. The prices looked great. This is a place I would make it a point to visit when I am back in town again."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant here ( in Arizona) ... you can not miss the happy hour on the weekends. The services is amazing, and if you do your reservations you don't need to wait in line to get in. Entres such as \"queso verde\" and \"nachos\" are a must!  And it's always fun to have eliges with the figures they have as decorations ( similar to Coco, the movie)"}
{"text":"Horrible!! The food was gross, and after bringing me the wrong item twice the server didn't even offer to take my meal off the tab. We were the only table in there and the server messed up everyone else's order too. When it was time to pay he got every bodies tab wrong, he handed me my tab at 8:00 and then grabbed it out of my hand. By the time I payed it was 8:30 and I'm sure it was the wrong amount but by that time I just wanted to leave. Also they brought the birthday girl her cake after most if the party left."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place?  Many choices for great tasting tacos, great atmosphere and hot waitresses.  I swear mine must have been a super model!!! LOL, you can tell I was impressed.  This place has a nice menu with many choices, its a little high end as far as pricing, but the quality is very good with so many combinations of tacos that you can get.  The particular visit, I had one fish taco only because I ate before, but I have been here before and the food is excellent.  If in the area, definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with family..the food was just OK..atmosphere was loud and crowded..service was OK..the house margarita was fantastic.."}
{"text":"Our go to Mexican place - happy hour every day from 3-7!! Their margaritas are my absolute favorite and their food never disappoints. We love this place!"}
{"text":"The food was just OK as well as the margaritas. The outdoor seating looked to be a good idea but when you have a bunch of college kids getting drunk in the same area it wasn't such a great spot."}
{"text":"This was our first (and last time) going here. We wanted a taco Tuesday. A friend recommended it to us. We sat for at least 15 with nothing. Got our drink order filled. No chips or water for us. Food was just okay. Couldn't order desert cause nobody told our server the kitchen was closed. Too many other places to go than to go through that again..."}
{"text":"We came here looking for tacos and it was still about half an hour before happy hour.   The service was amazing and they were wonderful with our dog.   The food: To be honest there food was ok - it was decent sized for the price but the island shrimp taco tastes more like sweet and sour chicken balls with shrimp, and the diablo shrimp taco was definitely not hot. It was standard fare that felt tasted like any other big chain Tex mex resto in North America.   But our service today (along with our instable appetite at the moment) made it a  good experience."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour deal - their house margarita is about $2.50 (I think that's right) - a total steal for a pretty tasty margarita, accompanied by some tasty tacos."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place.  The food was fresh, the atmosphere was great and everyone semed to be enjoying themselves.  We went on a Tuesday and it was $1 taco day.  What an amazing deal.  The house margarita was delicious.  We had a great experience and we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp when I typed in \"Mexican Food\" when we got into Scottsdale after our flight from KC.    To start - the margaritas were quite good! The BF ordered the Cadillac and I had the skinny margarita but added strawberries to it.  Both were delish.  We started with the chorizo cheese crisp and it was HUGE. So good though! I had a carne asada taco along with a side of rice for dinner and the BF had the pork tacos. We loved everything.  It was a little pricey but I guess that's what you get for having 3 margs on your bill! We'd come back though!"}
{"text":"Just stopped to have lunch. It was semi-decent Mexican food. Service was good but just thought food could be better. Guacamole was good but some of the chips were stale."}
{"text":"this place is good, simple and fast. Tuesdays they have deep fried beef tacos for 99 cents so I stay away from here on that night. The Al Pastor tacos are super super gooooooood. I havent ever had a bad thing on this menu. The fish tacos, are nothing special, but still not bad.  The owenrs are always walking around, checking on tables and super nice guys.  Really cool art on the walls"}
{"text":"Mar 5, for SF Giants Spring Training, was our second visit. Great service from host staff to serving team. Cool vibe, solid menu and great ambiance. Fun spot in the heart of Old Town. Pricing is reasonable as are the drinks!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing happy hour!!! They also have happy hour every day of the week. Their food is better and cheaper than a lot of the other Mexican restaurants in Old Town.  I don't know what the heck they put in their green salsa but it's sooooooo good!"}
{"text":"A disappointment for sure. We are taco junkies - especialllly street tacos - but these were far from authentic. Bland, almost flavorless everything incluing the guac. The margarita was just ok too. The food was edible and the prices were good,  but overall we won't be making the trip back."}
{"text":"The food was great! The margaritas were excellent, and lots of options! They have happy hour until 7pm every day which is awesome! Our server Delaney was the best and gave great service. My new favorite place."}
{"text":"First time today and maybe my last.  While I wouldn't say I would NEVER eat here again, I could live without it.  That says a lot considering I'm a Mexican food fanatic.  House margarita was pretty good, but  overpriced ($7) considering the glass was filled to the rim with ice, resulting in a rather small drink.  Both salsas were tasty (red tomato-based and green tomatillo), both spicy but the heat was not overpowering.  I love the ala carte idea for the taco menu as there are many to try, but found the food to be less than impressive.  I had a chicken taco (pollo asado) and beef (carne asada).  The chicken was bland and at room temperature.  The beef was a little more flavorful, but still only mildly warm.  My husband tried the lobster and fish tacos.  Both were overcooked and he complained there was not enough fish and too much cabbage.  He also ordered grilled street corn, but they apparently forgot to grill it.  Cien Agaves definitely has a fun atmosphere, cool decor, and a great idea with focusing on tequila and tacos, but the experience is lost with average food at best.  Reserve this place for happy hour, but look elsewhere for a good meal."}
{"text":"2nd time this week, because we like it so much the first time! Happy Hour was great, 3p-7p, and the Tacos here are great as well. We had The Tecate Fish & Carnitas Tacos, and loved them both. Also enjoyed the fresh guac!"}
{"text":"So many tequilas so little time!!! Great times!! Awesome margaritas! I highly recommend the Cadillac Margarita!!"}
{"text":"Arriving in Scottsdale on a Saturday morning, we chose this restaurant based on a desire for Mexican, the Yelp reviews, and the fact that few other restaurants seemed to be open.  We were delighted with the food. We started with the complimentary salsa - the tomato version was ok, but the green chile varietal was excellent and we ordered more - and a generous portion of guacamole.  My wife ordered the tinga taco, which is chicken in chipotle. The chicken was outstanding; I've never had chicken so tender. I had the lobster taco (lobster, fried, and servied with coleslaw) and the carne asada taco, with a hint of lime. Both were delicious.  Service was good and all of the staff were very friendly towards our sleeping baby.   Would definitely go there again. No complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in the area hands down. Loved it all service and food all superior."}
{"text":"Been here on a few occasions, most recently Cinco de Mayo and then this past wknd to use my Groupon. House margaritas are great!  Happy hour specials are good! Food is yumm-O! Only recently did i actually eat here... We sat in the bar area and were served by the bartender. It was a Sunday night, so not very busy. Service was great. He recommended the Ahi tacos, which the bf chose and said were good. I had the Tinga and Polla Asado tacos and was very pleased. The Tinga was probably my fave cuz of the spicyness but the Asado was great and lighter feeling in my belly.  Their chips and salsas are great... and Free!  =)   The bf had the Prickly Pear marg, which he wasn't big on... He likes fruity things, so prob just a taste preference thing.  I have a few friends who rave about the Cucumber marg, which i've tasted and is very good. The Chambord marg is also quite tasty! With a name like Cien Agave, i don't see how you can go wrong."}
{"text":"I have been to cien agaves many times. Last night was extremely disappointing to me. My boyfriend pulled a long black hair out of his fajita, which, our waitress had her hair down, and had long black hair. We informed her about the hair, she said, I will be right back. Only to go see, that she put her hair up before speaking with her manager about it. He comes up to the table. Is completely rude to us. Asks us to show the hair after my boyfriend had flinged it to ground in disgust. Needless to say, after how rude they were about it, I will never be going again"}
{"text":"I swear I did a review about this place. The queso verde was the best thing I've ever had!!! I could have licked the bowl.   Stopped in here after a long day of drinking and was famished and pretty buzzed. This was a Saturday night and the place was busy but not packed. Our service was a little slow, or maybe I was just really hungry. LOL.  I also had a two taco plate that was delish, but seriously, that queso verde with the pork in it was to die for!!!! I want to marry it. I would go back here in a heartbeat just for that queso.   Cute place and right in the heart of Old Town. Perfect place to regroup and refresh yourself to hit the town again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of places that don't try to do too much. \"Jack of all trades, master of none\" is a system that works for the Cheesecake Factory or the Yardhouse, and that's fine. However, I'd usually prefer to dine at a place that does just a few items well. Cien Agaves is an example of this. They do tacos and tequila. Yes, they have a couple of other standard-fare mexican items, but they're all about the tacos and tequila.  I had been there once before, and last night I went there again for a birthday party. Off the top, their tequila selection is solid - plenty of sippers available, and the prices are reasonable.  I did the 3-taco platter. Based on a friend's suggestion, I tried the Tinga taco, and that was the only one I didn't love. It wasn't bad or anything, but just not my thing. The Camarones a la diabla taco was delicious and had the bite as advertised, and the Ahi tuna taco was fantastic.  I look forward to returning sometime to enjoy their happy hour."}
{"text":"Cien Agaves could easily be compared to heaven itself. They have tons and tons of tequila and really nice servers such as, Jacob Canevett, who is a miracle worker when it comes to busying tables. Highly recommended place to eat especially if Jacob Canevett is working. ¡Gracias Cien Agaves!"}
{"text":"Love their chicken tacos! But no free chips and salsa. Waitresses don't seem to care about you when you visit. Rice is mediocre, black beans are tasteless. If their chicken wasn't so tasty I probably wouldn't come back, but I love those tacos too much."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Ordered my drink at 6:40 for happy house and wasn't served until after 7.  I repeatedly had to ask another server for our drinks and then finally they brought them to us. When they brought out the food that I ordered (2 Carnitas tacos) they were ice cold in the middle and I had to send them back. I will definitely not be returning. The drinks were ok, but after waiting over 20 minutes for a dos Equis and cold food, no thanks."}
{"text":"Go here for happy hour! They have the best chicken Tonga taco you'll ever have! Their guacamole is a dream too. I've had their bowls, nachos, and drinks too which never disappoint. So yummy! This place is always a win!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! I've been here plenty of times before, but this experience from last Friday night was outstanding. We took my mom here for her birthday dinner. We called in for reservations & to see if we could reserve a booth 2 HOURS BEFORE we were going to go there- they said no problem! Upon arrival, we were seated at a reserved booth and our server, Diana N., spared no time to come and get our drink order! Let me just say, Diana N. made my mom's birthday extra awesome! She was a fantastic server and went above and beyond. She even gave us an amazing churro/icecream birthday dessert (I doubt they do that for everyone).  We definitely will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a killer happy hour.  Great little taco and marg spot right in old town Scottsdale. Basically the entire menu is half off from (I think) 3-7.  We came in at around 6 on a Saturday and sat down right away.  We had some margs and tacos, a quesadilla and a queso dip.  The food was good not great, and easily made up for by the ambiance, location and atmosphere.  We will be back for sure, but can't justify paying non HH prices.  Check it out if you're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"man, this place was good. after a few drinks down the street for cinco de mayo, we walked over to cien agaves for some tasty food.  despite being quite full, we were seated within 5 minutes of arrival. you have to ask for the chips and salsa, and we did, and they were possibly the best complimentary chips and salsa i've ever had! the salsa's were even hot! as in spicy....  3pm rolled around and we started our happy hour drinking. 3.50 for house margaritas...not the crappy pre-made mix kind...the good stuff! and boy were they good! so good i had 2, could've had more, but the day was young. i ordered the cheese enchiladas and unlike most \"mexican\" restaurants, ay chihuahua, these were awesome! the tortillas were cooked evenly..no rubbery ends to gnaw on. the cheese was gooey and plentiful and the sides of rice and beans were a nice filler.   service was fantastic...kept the water coming and despite the place being packed, she checked on us constantly throughout our hour long stay.   i can't wait to hit up their daily happy hour again, 3-7pm!"}
{"text":"This place was mediocre from start to finish. From the service to the horrible drinks and cold tortillas. Don't waist your money"}
{"text":"Who would think you could find decent Mexican food in Old Town.? Located among the souvenir shops is a welcomed destination.  We started with a margarita spiced with jalapeños, that finishes with a little bite to it. We ordered guacamole and chips to start.  Next, we went with a burrito and enchiladas. The portion sizes are large and are very filling. Red and green sauce options are available to finish."}
{"text":"When  I return to Scottsdale I  really enjoy returning to Cien Agaves. The atmosphere is fun and vibrant. The waitresses are all hot. They have a great deal on  taco Tuesdays. They have a wide selection of drinks. I really enjoy the blackberry mojito and the perfectly Arizonan yet exotic prickly pear margarita.  The service is quick and you get chips and salsa before the meal. It's a great place to  meet friends and have a  pleasant evening when you are in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Cien Agaves, you have potential, but you let me down.  On the plus side, happy hour is decent at half price appetizers, free chips & salsa and cheap drinks. I've been here 6 times for happy hours and decided to use my Living Social deal for a dinner last weekend.   Bad decision, my happy hour memories are ruined. Stale chips, slow and awful service and I found a hair in the free salsa and had an overall horrible experience. I used a Living Social deal for $10 for $20 and the visit solidified my decision to not go back again, not even for happy hour.  The service is awful, the hostess doesn't greet people as they enter or say goodbye as they leave...I never thought I'd notice a hostess so much until I saw how little this one did. She spent most the time picking at her nails while at the front.   We had a party of 5 total and 3 of them came after we had already ordered our drinks. Our server never took drink orders for them and we had to grab her to order more food.   Our food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. Service was horrible, but they didn't even seem that busy.  We would have ended up spending a lot more $ here on food and drinks but decided to go other places in old town to get good service.  Management...please take the helpful hints, because I know you can be a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and appetizers., I ordered watermelon margarita and it was awesome.. chicken quesadilla and churros were good too .. will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night-- was with a group of about 15 for a birthday dinner. We all met up at about 8 pm, so the dinner rush was over, and the place had more empty tables than occupied. Here is why I feel this place is 2-star worthy.  -Waitress was a really nice girl, but the food and drink ordering was very poorly orchestrated.  -Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.  -Food was coming at different times. By the time the other end of the table had gotten their food, we were done eating.. even though we all ordered at the same time.  -My order was not correct. I was hungry and ate it anyway. When I told the waitress, she brought out the correct food for me and didn't charge me for it (which I insisted otherwise).. I thought that was really nice.  -The food itself was just mediocre. Living in AZ, you know good mexican food. This place misses the mark.  Just an ok place. Maybe I would have had a different experience if it weren't a group venture."}
{"text":"Decent food at a decent price. Could  be more seasoned and tasty. Margaritas were gross, nothing special. Crowd was very loud and rowdy, many many young \"tool\" type guys looking for girls that really aren't there. Reminds me of spring break at Lake Havasu. Overall ok, nothing more."}
{"text":"Visiting from FLORIDA, read the YELP reviews... they were all right.  Delicious, fresh hot food served with a smile and great service.  Be sure and try the KALUA FLAN.  Highly recommend this place.  Gets busy early, a fun happy, crowd."}
{"text":"Chips & salsa are really good! Cheese crisp is awesome! The margaritas are to die for! The strawberry margarita is my favorite! It's a little loud, chips & salsa doesn't come out right away you need to ask, the decorations are great! it's a very chill atmosphere good lighting, plenty of TVs to watch sports on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Quick service. Loved the patio, less noisy. Carne asado taco and tinga taco were delicious.   I recommend the soapapillas with prickly pear jam."}
{"text":"Here in San Francisco we have a place called Tres Agaves (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tres-agaves-san-francisco#hrid:YpvCLegLph2ny8uY24tH-Q), and it's pretty good.  One would think that Cien Agaves would be 33 1/3 times better, but sadly, it was not the case.  Walking down First Avenue, we saw Cien Agaves and decided to try it.  We asked for a table on the patio, and they gladly accommodated our request.  We were lucky to get a table on the actual patio, not in the driveway next to it.  The driveway was home to 6-8 tables and a few heating lamps.  We sat down and enjoyed the potpourri of smell sensations: fresh spring Arizona air, grilled onions and second-hand smoke.  The couple next to us sure did enjoy those Marlboro lights.  Our server was quick, efficient and friendly.  She managed to keep up with our indecisive party of six, while refilling our drinks, waters and chips and salsa.  The food here, however, just wasn't very good.  I ordered a steak fajita, which may have been a mistake.  The giant skillet had a lot of onions and bell peppers on it, but not too much in the steak department.  It may have been a blessing in disguise, because the few morsels of steak I did find were not particularly tasty.  They were overcooked, rough and flavorless.    I did like the atmosphere and the service here, but the food wasn't even of Chevy's quality.  It's definitely more of a place to get a drink with your friends and maybe have a taco or two (or ten - the whole taco combination platter).    2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Never been so unsatisfied with tacos...the pops were flat, the chicken tacos were burnt..the sour cream was really thin.. when asked about paying for the flat pop, they had to go talk about removing it from the bill.. we had a bigger group for work... we will never recommend  or go back here again.."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely awful. Waitress had a terrible memory clearly and continuously asked what we ordered..... and the wait to get our drinks/food was well over an hour. Food was awful. TERRIBLE CHOICE."}
{"text":"We discovered this restaurant while walking around the shops in old town Scottsdale. We had margaritas and a variety of tacos. All were good. My rating was lowered because of an issue regarding seating. The hostess told us that there would be a twenty minute wait although there was a nearby empty table in plain site.  The reason given was that two large parties were being served nearby. We went in the bar area to wait but were not allowed to put a third chair at one of the empty two seat tables. We then went to the outside area where we were initially hassled about seating 3 at the table and what could be served outside at that time. Eventually someone was reasonable and allowed us to order both food and drinks. I lowered my rating because of the seating issue."}
{"text":"I called in an order today and told them no cheese or creme. When I go to pick it up, there's creme on it. I mention it and they come back 10 minutes later with the renewed order. Come to find out, all they did was wipe off the creme. This is a good way to get sued. If someone says no xyz on their food, it's probably for a good reason, for example an Allergy. Wiping it off doesn't count as NO xyz. Deducting a star for a lazy chef who is a potential health hazard."}
{"text":"In the words of my wife: \"I mean, I guess it was all right.\"    I give it a solid \"meh.\"  I knew something was awry when the waitress asked if we wanted \"polo tacos.\"  Like, she said polo, not pollo.  A little thing for sure...But when the food arrived, it showed that if we wanted authentic Mexican food, we should look elsewhere in Phoenix (like Tempe).  The tacos tinga were the highlight.  My daughters quesadilla was HUGE (but she didn't like the cheese they used).  It was literally bigger than my three tacos.  That said, service was courteous and responsive, atmosphere was good.  But yeah, not going back.  Drive a few miles south or west and get better tacos for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Fabulous selection of unique tacos. Had the 3 taco plate with salmon, grilled Ono and pork. Each one had its own unique flavor - hard to decide which was my favorite. The other members of our party had the same experience. Service was courteous and prompt, and we were able to make last-minute reservations on Open Table. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour even on weekends. 4.3 stars  Food: 4, Atmosphere: 4, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 5 (for happy hour half off house margarita and appetizers) Return worthiness: yes Eve award: best az queso dip  Highlights: - Queso: green chile version was awesome and chips were extra crispy. 5 stars  - Happy hour prices: we got 2 beers, 2 margaritas, a taco, 4 taquitos, and queso and chips for $25!!! - Staff: everyone was friendly  - Setup: seating and bar upstairs and downstairs with tvs to watch sports  Lowlights: - Chicken hard shelled taco: not much flavor and meat a bit dry - Took quite a while to get our appetizers after we ordered  Had a great time watching the Packers win here. I'll be back for the queso at happy hour."}
{"text":"I\"m going to get my one negative out of the way right now so there is nothing left but praise-their Margaritas are EXPENSIVE. With that in mind-they are my favorite margaritas in town (the prickly pear one in particular).  My girlfriends and i love to go there on Tuesday nights because they do $1 Shredded Beef Tacos that are incredible and $2 Tecate Beer (however we always end up ordering the $14 Margaritas anyway, haha).  Never fails to be a fun time over there."}
{"text":"Killer taco selection & happy hour.  You can't go wrong with cheap tacos & beer."}
{"text":"I moved to North Scottsdale in 2015.  As somebody who loves to eat out and appreciates the opportunity to taste new cuisines and food, I keep a keen eye on the restaurant scene.  But like most people I use filters to sort thru new food places that show up on my radar.  Cien Agaves has been one such place. The only reason it has taken me over 30 months to come and eat here has been my perception that this place being in the middle of Old Town is probably a tourist trap. Not really true! After lunching here two days ago, I am convinced of the quality of the food served here.  Also the whole ambiance is great. Fantastic, but funky, art on the walls. Great music.  So I am coming back.  I ordered the Tres Tacos! One each of shredded beef, diablo shrimp and carnitas.  OMG! Great flavor; outstanding texture; optional hot sauce to raise the temperature.  Gracias!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Family of four covered the menu; burrito with shrimp diabla, five different tacos, and a fajita bowl. Flavors were gloriously enticing and created a euphoric experience for our taste buds. The margarita was on point, my wife came alive when the sweet nectar hit her lips. The guacamole was beyond the normal limitations of your everyday guacamole. This is the guacamole we need in our world.   The salsas moved the nacho chips from excellent to the sublime, complimenting the cornucopia of flavors generated by the soon to be legendary kitchen.   And Katie, our waitress, was fantastic.   It was really good. Seriously."}
{"text":"Great environment! The staff was friendly and provided great service! I had the Tinga, Island, and Chorizo tacos! Wow........very flavorful! Not to mention the margaritas! Shhhhhh don't tell but I had two! The pomegranate margarita was very flavorful and the amount of tequila was on point! The prices were great as well! I was there for dinner, but viewing the happy hour prices, no doubt I'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Thanks Cien Agave for serving the community with great food, drink, HH, & service! Also thanks for the support of the Red for Ed community efforts."}
{"text":"So being in AZ for the weekend - I'm for some reason being taken to only taco restaurants.. I'm OK with that... cuz obviously I LUV FOOD!   So Saturday night we pull up to this little spot in Scottsdale to meet up with the rest of the crew and sit and have a drink - I ask the bartender give me your best 2 tacos - so I get the carne asada and the mahi mahi-   The carne asada was delicious, it was tender spicy and just melted in your mouth- i instantly gobbled that one up right away- The girl sitting next to me advised me that the mahi mahi was the best she has ever tried at the restaurant. So i drink my drink and talk with my friends, after about 10 min I decided to dive into this scrumptious mahi mahi taco.. only to be left disappointed- if i wanted to have dessert on top of my dinner i would eat it that way- to say the least i wash left unsatisfied with the taco.   My good friend said here try a little bite of this... it's the lobster taco... i said OK why not..   OMG! The flavors were amazing it was spicy, soft and succulent, and just melted on my tongue.. my tongue actually woke up and my mouth was exploding with flavor! This is what i was waiting for...   This is a good little spot - i would definitely come back again- the service was great! friendly and perfect.   my tummy was happy!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and awesome happy hour. If you're looking for somewhere relaxed and trying to have a fun time with some good foo, this is your place !"}
{"text":"OMG I loved this place! I wish I could have tried more food on the menu, but I guess that will be next time I visit Old Town Scottsdale :).  The happy hour specials are every day, $3.50 margaritas.  Aye carumba!  They were big too.  I was hungry and they have 1/2 price apps.  I didn't order any but got a fajita salad which comes in this ginormous taco shell.  It was SO GOOD and I had the best dressing, creamy jalapeno.  It even had hockey playoffs on - Pittsburgh vs Philly.  I'm in love, I'm all shook up."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We came here to celebrate a birthday party and were able to reserve the entire top floor of the restaurant. Everyone loved the margaritas, but if you want to get a bit more bold, try the beer-garita.   When I came, I was starving and the chips and salsa were seriously incredible. I really love the salsa Verde, and everyone around me loved the salsa roja.  Despite my hunger, I wanted to have something a bit on the lighter and cheaper side. The fajita bowl fit the bill and was a great mix of vegetables, rice, beans and cheese. Nothing too fancy but still great.   The waitresses were super nice and with such a large group, handled us really well. Definitely check this place out if you're in old Towne and looking for some quality eats."}
{"text":"Arguably the best happy hour in the area. (1/2 price apps and a lot of drink specials until 7pm on weeknights) We started with the guacamole, which was solid. I had the burrito smothered in red enchilada sauce. Had a nice kick, and the burrito itself was huge. The black beans it came with on the side were very tasty. Tortilla chips appear to be make in house. Patio is very nice and somewhat intimate. Would visit again."}
{"text":"We had a green chile cheese crisp and the guacamole with pom seeds and those were great! I also got the poblano soup which was ridiculously tasty and nice and spicy, and my friend got a chicken tinga taco which she said was great. Even the lemonade was delicious. The red salsa was yummy as well, but the green was way too heavy on the cumin and tasted like a dude's armpit. The service was efficient, friendly, and cheerful. I imagine it would be too loud at peak hours but it was just before the rush and was moderate when we were there. I want more of everything now!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican food ever.  We had two house margaritas.  Nice big glass...but had a lot of ice.  :(. The chips and house-made salsas were amazing!  Husband had 3 tacos, rice and beans.  I had the fajita taco salad.  Everything was outstanding.  The ingredients tasted so fresh!  Dinner with two house Margaritas was $45 without tip."}
{"text":"A very cute Mexican Restaurant.   The service was great, had a great waitress. What we really loved was that I asked for her to charge our phone and she brought a portable charger to our table (A - M - A - Z - I - N - G).   We really enjoyed the Guac, which had pomegranate seeds on top .... So delicious.   I had the chicken fajitas .... which had a good flavor but a bit burn :(   But the food was pretty good, my friend enjoyed his tacos."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great people, great atmosphere, great tequila, and great food!!!   been here with friends, family, and coworkers. The hh is a fun time and late night tacos and margaritas..... can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Been going to this old town restaurant for many years. Always had great bartenders great service and the best margaritas in old town Scottsdale. Every time people come from out of town we go there and I've had company events there spending thousands of dollars. Live 40 minutes away in North Scottsdale and still go there until today. The last two times we've gone there in the last two month we left. Our service was slow and unusual very poor service. One bartender overwhelmed sat at the bar 20 minutes without anybody taking an order. I mentioned it to the girl in the reception area and response was \"oh really?\" must be under new management or no management. Will not return."}
{"text":"I missed trying the ceviche that Cien Agaves served at Yelp in Bloom, so when I was invited to go to Cien Agaves for a friend's birthday dinner this past Friday night, I was excited to check it out!  The birthday boy made a reservation for 8pm, and when we arrived fashionably late (thanks to my husband), the rest of our group (approximately 15 people) were already seated, eating chips and salsa, and drinking margaritas.  We caught up pretty quickly thanks to Lindsay, our waitress - I had a margarita made with Vodka and J went with a beer.    The food was decent.  I think the 3.5 star average is right on... I split shrimp fajitas with J and shared in the guacamole, nachos, and a few other apps that the table had.  The guys that ordered the special ahi tacos really enjoyed them.    I have yet to try the ceviche and I may even go for the tequila margarita next visit, but I'd for sure return to Cien Agaves in the future.  Two drinks was all I needed and I was done for the night.  Happy hour anyone?!"}
{"text":"We showed up after calling 30 minutes before and we were told 30 -45 minute wait and when we got here they told us there was a 2 hour wait . Horrible customer service , no apologies from rude girl at the desk"}
{"text":"First of all, the bartender was extremely attentive and very patient. I came in with people from out of town and even though I knew exactly what I wanted, my friends asked a lot of questions and the bartenders were very thorough with their explanations and hospitality. Their daily specials are such a good deal and I did I mention their awesome hospitality? Come check it out!"}
{"text":"One word, AMAZING.  If you're looking for a great experience with amazing food, try this place out.   Almosphere : 10/10 Customer service: 10/10 Food quality: 10/10  We arrived at 1pm and only waited a minute to be seated. Everyone was friendly and the waitress took our order right away.   My girlfriend ordered the shrimp tacos while I ordered the carne asada. Both came out in a timely fashion and were very tasty.   YOU HAVE TO TRY THEIR GUACAMOLE. IT'S TRUELY ON ANOTHER LEVEL.   Pro tip: order the churro Sunday and you won't be dissapointed.   I'll definitely be taking my entire family here in the future as it's now my go to spot in Scottsdale for some amazing and authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Perfect for watching sports with multiple TV and the atmosphere is laid back. Their tacos are super tasty, especially any of the seafood. I was amazed at the tasty unique margaritas, like avocado. I was skeptical, but was pleasantly surprised. If your in downtown Scottsdale this is a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"If you're going to a Giants spring training game you must go here first! Their happy hour is second to none.  We were there on a Tuesday and they had $2 tecate, $1.50 shredded beef tacos and half price appetizers.  They bring you free chips with 2 different types of salsa.  We left there with full bellies and spending $30 (which included a very generous tip)."}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but the one person I would trust most in the field of tacos would be a luchador. If a Mexican wrestler can vouch for an establishments tacos, then really, they've just got to be good. And due to the number of luchador paintings in Cien Agaves, I think it's just a fact that these are some of the most delicious tacos in Old Scottsdale.  These wee little tacos can be ordered a la carte, or in a combo of 2 or 3 plus rice and beans. Go for three. Sure, two would fill you up, but why would you waste an opportunity to try yet another variety of taco? THAT would be ridiculous. I opted for an all seafood night, chowing down on a beer battered ono taco, the island shrimp taco (served with an awesome tangy and sweet sauce), and an ahi tuna taco. The first two were glorious, some of the best i'd ever had. They weren't huge, but they were stuffed liberally. This is especially true of the plump shrimp, which didn't taste remotely Mexican to me, but were delicious nonetheless. I unfortunately didn't care for the ahi tacos, and I love ahi tuna. They weren't bad, just very average. And average looks bad when next to glory.   OH and did I mention habanero-lime margaritas? Sure they have plenty of different, unique flavors (hibiscus, blood-orange, prickly pear, cucumber) but that habero-lime is the perfect mix of refreshing and a kick. I would have had a dozen, if they'd had let me.   Who knows when I'll be back in Scottsdale, but when I am, I'll be sure to chow down at Cien Agaves. And maybe even steal one of those luchador paintings!"}
{"text":"The fiancé and I went here not too long ago and the place was dead, which typically is not a bad thing.  Cien Agaves  is the typical Scottsdale restaurant trying too hard to be hip, cool, and gilded.  If you wear a tapout shirt, a trucker hat, own a purse that has Coach or Louis Vuitton logos plastered all over it, or support your millionaire-like partying lifestyle with a $30k a year job, then this is the place for you.  It comes off as an insincere/non-genuine attempt to produce quality southwestern food and the forced atmosphere comes off as tacky.  And a large tequila selection does not legitimize a restaurant - what a large tequila selection is to a restaurant is what a corvette is to a 50 tear old man in a mid-life crisis, they are trying to compensate for something.  Meal: I took full advantage of the pork and chicken tacos.  The fiancé had three or four vegetarian tacos.  We both had a margarita.  I had the house margarita and she went for a fruitier (I want to say raspberry, but I could be totally off . . . SAMSONITE) style of margarita.  Taste:  Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh, these tacos didn't leave a good, lasting impression.  The key to an outstanding taco is an outstanding tortilla.  That doesn't mean they have to be homemade, but it does certainly help.  These tortillas were no where close to being outstanding.  The tortillas were incredibly dry and cold.  They lacked the structural integrity to keep all the guts of a the taco in tact so you can eat it.  It turned into a complete hot mess when the fiancé and I went to dig in.  The fillings were significantly lacking any real seasoning.  For example, one of the tacos I picked was supposed to include green chiles.  I saw stuff on the taco that looked like green chiles but it sure as hell didn't taste like it.  To top it off, the margaritas weren't that good either.  5 out of 10.  Value:  Like the margaritas, the value was nothing to brag about.  Not bad, not great . . .   I didn't feel ripped off after I paid for the bill, but it felt like the meal was missing something else given the price we paid.  2 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  The waitress really seemed like she was pissed off to be at work that day.  We constantly had empty water glasses.  She would swing by to pick up empty glasses, plates, and other things but wouldn't ask us if we needed anything else.  And she would always run to the bar to talk to the bartender and another server.  We were the only people in the place.  There was no excuse for the poor service.  3 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  See above opening statement.  I guess I jumped the gun and couldn't put my thoughts in the right location in my review. 1 out of 5.  Overall:  There are so many better places to go to in the valley, why bother coming here?  11 out of 30 points, 1 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wow! My boyfriend and I ate here last night and had a great experience. We reserved a table with OpenTable and got into a quaint booth on the side of the restaurant. We each ordered the three taco plate and thoroughly enjoyed each one. As far as margaritas go, the selection is amazing! I ordered the Cien Agaves margarita and it was the best marg I have ever tasted. Last, our server, Kyle, was one of the best servers I have ever had- very attentive and kind. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had the carbs asada taco, diablo shrimp taco and the mahi mahi taco. They were all average. I was not impressed by the food. The environment is fun and a great location, but I will keep looking for better tacos."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for an early dinner on a Wednesday night. Decided to give cien agaves a try, and boy are we glad we did. We sat in the courtyard area, which really helped since the inside is nothing to write home about. I had the three taco special; two fried fish and one chicken. The chicken was just ok, but the fish tacos were excellent.   Also, their selection of tequila is impressive.   My only complaint is that they are slow to bring out chips and salsa.  We were midway through our first drink before any chips were delivered.  We would definitely visit cien agaves again."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and the tacos were tasty, but the habanero margarita was the star of evening. A great spot for a casual dinner in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great Bartenders!  Wonderful happy hour with 1/2 priced appetizers everynight! Mondays have $2.50 shrimp tacos...Tuesdays are Taco Tuesdays with $2.50 Tinga Tacos!  Get in here!!!"}
{"text":"What a cute little place in Old Town!  We went on a Sunday during football season, so there were a bunch of food and drink specials.  Their margaritas were good as well as the food.  The servers were friendly and attentive.  We don't get into Scottsdale all too often, but we'll definitely stop back in this place!"}
{"text":"They are the most gracious and welcoming staff. They have a great happy hour. Great food and drinks. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Trendy taco shop in Old Town Scottsdale with good menu."}
{"text":"We went here before a Spring Training game after also finding this place last summer. Good margaritas and price is fair during happy hour for the house marg. The chicken tinga taquitos and crisp on the appetizer were great and for 4 people enough to keep us full for a bit. I wish for HH they maybe took $2 off other full priced margs if you wanted to try some of there more creative concoctions but all in all a fun place. Patio was nice in March!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted Authentic Mexican food and we found this place.  We were seated outside in an alley way, which had a very nice feel to it.  They provided free chips and salsa.  The 2 taco platter (Grill Mahi Mahi and Pollo Asado) and a side of Mexican street corn I had was rich with savoring flavors.  It made my taste buds explode!  My boyfriend had the same but instead of chicken he had the Island Shrimp and he enjoyed his as well.  Needless to say, we'll be back for more and possibly dessert (if we aren't to stuffed)."}
{"text":"My new go to Mexican in Phoenix. Amazing staff!!!  Guacamole is fresh, mildly tart, chunky & topped with pomegranate seeds. Tinga chicken tacos covered with freshest veggies and creamy creama! Happy hour means $2 for the tacos and half price on the guacamole. I'm in love!!"}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday afternoon while we were in town for a friend's wedding and it was really good! We were seeking out some good Mexican food and this was where the reviews led us. Our waiter that we had (and I hate that I can't remember his name) was AMAZING. He was so helpful and attentive and had great suggestions for everything since it was our first time. My husband had a burrito with red and green sauce and it was a hit. I had their Tinga taco and carne asada taco, and I wasn't in love with the tinga taco but the carne asada was good! I also had one of their Prickly Pear margaritas (I was most excited for this as you can't find these anywhere in Milwaukee) but I was a tad disappointed. It wasn't as good as ones I've had elsewhere and it was pretty pricey at $12. Their chips and salsa were great though as they have a few different salsa choices they give you instead of just the typical one. All in all, it was a good experience and I'm glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"I recently dined here with some friends on a Sunday, and it will definitely be my last time.  The food took FOREVER to got.  The drinks were mostly mixer...I saw one previous comment on here that said they were \"virgin\" drinks. That's a great description. Our waitress was a despondent little grouch who definitely had an expression on her face suggesting that she had somewhere better to be. Maybe she did.   I also don't know why people keep saying \"great\" prices.  The Margaritas are $10 dollars! The fast food chain Chipotle is a better mexican food experience.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT CIEN AGAVES!!!!"}
{"text":"Before going tonight, we heard from a friend that this restaurant was really great and delicious. Unfortunately, that was not the case when we went this evening. Four of us cousins went out to celebrate a birthday. We made a reservation and were seated just fine. It took about 15 minutes for anyone to come ask for our drink orders. We ordered and then waited literally an hour for our food. We were told they were backed up in the kitchen so we weren't freaking out too much... However, my cousin and I both ordered the Ahi Pokè Bowl, and they were BOTH brought out with hard rice that had barely been cooked. Apparently the whole batch had been undercooked and no one had noticed before sending it out. We kept having to flag people down because all of the servers were frantically moving about the restaurant. We expected to have been compensated in some way, but NOTHING was taken off of the bill. It was ridiculous. The only saving grace was that our waiter was nice and tried his best to make up for the kitchen staff being behind. But for a restaurant old town Scottsdale I was NOT impressed. I will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"After a chaotic, drawn-out airport experience with my family and first air travel for my two infant nieces, we walked a few blocks of old town and thought cien agaves made the best walk by impression. Our seating needs looked doubtful at first, but the staff quickly scrambled to accommodate our party of six adults and 2 babies. The menu is full of everything you expect for Mexican and more, mainly a large variety of specialty tacos. I mainly enjoyed local craft beers, guacamole, and tacos. Great drinks, great food, great staff."}
{"text":"A+.  Sat at the bar--got right in at 7:30 on a Friday night.  Immediate service.  Great house margarita.  Had pomegranate seeds on the homemade guacamole--never thought of that but will have to do this at home now.  Able to get steak fajitas done medium rare--which is disappointing everywhere else--but perfect here!  Already counting down to my next trip to Scottsdale to come back!"}
{"text":"Mexican fare in fun Old Town Scottsdale.  The variety of margaritas making choosing just one difficult.  The habanero one is good, but you really have to be able to take the heat.  Make sure you have water nearby.  The watermelon one is refreshing but I think I missed the watermelon flavor.  The prickly pear margarita is delicious.  I want to try the avocado one next.  The tacos are awesome - great variety to choose from - try the Mahi Mahi and diablo ones.  Tasty!"}
{"text":"This place has great food, good service, and excellent outdoor atmosphere. Tacos are good, drinks are strong, and sitting outside under the zigzag of string lights is very romatic and laid back atmosphere. We come here a lot and order the ceviche which is amazing. Happy hour is the best, and taco Tuesdays. The music is laid back, and we seem to sit here for hours and talk, and drink, and eat tacos. It's fun to see people walk by and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Great little place! We had 4 house margaritas, 3 Tinga tacos and guacamole and chips for less than $27! And it was all delicious! Can't beat the value."}
{"text":"Great spot! Was looking for a spot close to where my kids were taking a class and was sold when I saw the name. The tequila menu was impressive and I will be back to try more! The green salsa was amazing, I think my friend wanted to slurp it straight from the bowl. We both had a variety of tacos that were delicious. It's a bit far from home but will return anytime we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon, we discovered this place last Summer and have been back several times.  Located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, it's near all of the Western Shops and knicknack stores....a great place to grab a bite if you're walking around and doing some shopping.  Highlight of some items we've ordered here:  Los Nachos (Chips, Black Beans, Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapenos, Crema Mexicana, Grilled Chicken), $9.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ja4stXdNYr39u5CZHMNtjw?select=O-yvBcKbgwf9Do-vpgr5xQ#O-yvBcKbgwf9Do-vpgr5xQ  Chicken Tortilla Soup (Bowl), $5.50  Steak Fajitas, $15.95  3 Taco Special (any 3 Tacos), $12.95 I've ordered this several times.  Some of the Tacos I've tried are: - Taco al Pastor - Shredded Beef Taco - Carne Asada Taco - Carnitas Taco - Pollo Asado Taco  My 2 favs on that list are the Carne Asada & the Taco al Pastor Tacos.  Overall, the food is pretty good and the Margaritas are excellent.  We've only come here during lunchtime and the service is so/so.  Sometimes we get an experienced server and they're good.  Other times we get a young, inexperienced college student that has no clue and forgets to serve us our complimentary Chips & Salsa....that's happened on 2 visits.  The inconsistent service is what knocks them down from a 4 to a 3 Star for me.  Return Factor - 60%"}
{"text":"Great tacos! There were so many delicious choices on the menu! The fajitas were delicious and so fresh! I came here with a group of teacher friends because I saw this business supports the #redfored movement and I seek out business who support the community. AND, the food was so good!"}
{"text":"Just so you know, I don't come here for the Malibu. I've been a regular since October 2007 when they opened their doors. And their house margarita is THE absolute best I've ever had. I can't get enough of them!!  Food is awesome and if you get the chips and salsa, be prepared to eat five basketfuls. They are just that darn good.   I've also had happy hour parties and a birthday party upstairs. Great place to hang out!!!! Go there... or suffer from crappy margaritas elsewhere :)"}
{"text":"We went during happy hour on a Friday, so it was pretty busy but we were still seated right away. We each had a house margarita (which was half price) and split the nachos (also half price). We probably could have stopped there and been full. We got a burrito and chimichanga as well. They were both amazing! Had to take those home because we were stuffed. The service can be a little slow due to the crowds but the food is great."}
{"text":"We had the absolute most horrific queso fundido of our lives here.    Oily, greasy, paste... yuck.  However, some of the tacos were redeeming.    My chicken was super spicy, my carnitas was too mild - but together they worked well.  My husband didn't particularly care for his lobster (skimpy, more breading than lobster) and thought his pork (not carnitas) was dry.  I really wish we tried harder to find a better place.      A few days later we did - heaven lies just down the street at Frank and Lupes.  We visited on a Sunday or Monday in September for dinner and were the only patrons.    The economy sucks man!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour---the queso dip was good but everything else was so-so. The guacamole was tasteless, tacos average and the tostada was pretty terrible. Not a fan--won't come back. I will stick with salty señorita!"}
{"text":"Best Carnita Tacos ever! Great friendly staff and prompt courteous service. Love their Tinga tacos also and my friend really enjoyed the smoked chicken quesadilla"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour deala!! They have happy hour every day from 3-7pm. Half price appetizers & $4 house margaritas!"}
{"text":"Everybody was very very nice!! Food was delicious! I got 3 different tacos, carni asada was good, but meat was not flavored at all. Mahi Mahi was good fish, but didn't like what ever they tried to mix in the taco with the fish, and Al pastor was delicious omg!!! Street corn was more than anybody could ever ask for, for corn! Rice was perfectly best! And enchiladas, was like sitting in heaven! Never knew they could taste like that! I would rate this 5 star, however, if the carni asada was flavor less, and the did a poor vegi mix, so it's not perfect yet.. Lol. I definitely WOULD recommend it though!"}
{"text":"Love Cien Agaves - the best Happy Hour in town! We love going to the awesome FREE concerts in the park at Scottsdale Performing Arts Center on Sunday afternoon. Afterwards a brief walk into town, we have a delicious appetizer/dinner at Cien Agaves -  1/2 price margaritas & 1/2 price appetizers... the BEST GUACAMOLE we've ever had!  Try it, you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and incredible service. The guacamole is a must! The corn was something different and DELICIOUS! They had great happy hour prices and the margaritas were impeccable. There was great variety- try them all!!!"}
{"text":"went last night- - tacos were excellent- we tried siz different kinds all good- salsa and chips excellent and $2 Tecate cans- good visit- would recommend"}
{"text":"Had a great meal of Carne Asada tacos and a cheese crisp. The Local margarita was fantastic and Marissa, our waitress, took very good care of us. We will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"The senora and I decided to stop by after talking a walk through town. We were seated right away and looked at the menu. They have a lot of Tequilas to chose from if you want to enjoy sampling shots. The Margarita list was suave too. I had a special Margi and the senor had a Mojito. Both were very tasty.   The food was fine, not great but very good. We decided to sample tacos. Each of the choices were pretty good and the dish came with rice and beans. It's a nice place to stop and enjoy tasty drinks."}
{"text":"We just love the taco's here and the House Margaritas are awesome!  Great staff and a great environment."}
{"text":"Awesome! We had reservations so didn't have to wait long to get seated. We got in just before happy our ended and the waitress got all our drink and appetizer orders in time. Waitress was great. Food was great. We were there on taco Tuesday so their reg beef tacos were $2 each. Wow! Great time and great food."}
{"text":"Met girlfriends for drinks and appetizers. Drinks were fair, and they actually did make a special order for me, although not as good as I had at other restaurants. Food was less than mediocre. We only ordered veggies quesadillas. It was cut in four pieces and the two end pieces had cheese and no veggies. We asked for extra veggies on the next order and it was a tad improved but nothing special. Service was fair to bad. The server forgot silverware, forgot extras we asked for three times, forgot to ring our check had to ask twice to get the check and she said she wondered what was in her pocket. It was the clipboard with our credit card and cash.The worst part though was sitting on the patio two of the people in the party had to face the alley and the garbage cans which, well, smelled of garbage. Won't be back anytime soon. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Katrina L and I dined at the very same table and her dead-on coverage of Cien Agaves' strengths (recessionista-friendly) and weaknesses (atmosphere, \"margs\") has tempted me to chime in. The vibe here is pretty blah. If they invested a little in some art/curtains/less bright lights, I think this place could be considered a fun date place, as opposed to a destination for a grande groups.  Maybe my time back on the East Coast has made me desperate for any kind of edible Mexican, but I did enjoy the food. The queso was a huge hit (turns out chorizo in melted cheese can change lives) and the dos tacos especial (2 tacos- you can mix and match any from the menu + rice + beans = $8.95) made the menu muy caliente to me."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place as we were looking for someplace to sit outside.  Being from NE, it seemed all the places in Scottsdale had on the heat--it was 70 degrees and too hot for heat for a NE girl.    We planned on just having a drink but were surprised by the incredible selection of tacos.  We started with the ceviche appetizer which was good.   Chips and salsa was also good, with two salsa selections.  We then had the cheese dip appetizer, which was awesome.  It was definately \"real\" cheese as opposed to some of the other \"cheese\"dips I have had where they are 1% cheese and 99% something else like cheese food.  The taco selection included lobster, shrimp, chicken, pork, salmon.  Quite impressive.  They were all great.    I'm no longer a tequila drinker but their selection is quite impressive and they make their margaritas all fresh with freshly squeezed lime juice.  I did take a sip of one, it was definately a winner!"}
{"text":"So cute on the outside, so disappointing in reality.  I had 3 tacos, Diablo  shrimp, beer battered fish and grilled mahi mahi.  The mahi mahi was bitter and flat out inedible; I'm not sure if the fish had gone bad but I wouldn't have eaten it either way.  The beer battered fish was a tiny sliver of fish over an overly sweet garnish/filling.  The spicy shrimp were cloyingly sweet and tasted like someone had put a scoop of cheap Chinese food in a corn tortilla.  We brought this to the waitress's attention and they credited $2 to our bill.   My husband's salad was decent but quite pricy by the time he had some extra vegetables and guacamole added.  The guacamole and queso we had to start with were both fine, as were the rice and beans served as sides.  I vacillated between a 1 and a 2 on this rating and decided to be generous with a 2.  If street tacos and tequila are what you're craving I'd recommend Joyride Taco House which is a 4 or 5 star experience for the same concept."}
{"text":"Ok, so maybe I do things wrong. I start with a place's Happy Hour to see what a venue is like. I have to give the wait staff at Cien Agaves 5 stars. They were awesome, but the experience was less than memorable. They had some issue where they did not have chicken tinga. Coincidentally a Happy Hour item. But then, it took 20 minuets to get guacamole. In the mean time my party ordered a quesadilla with grilled chicken. Guess what?  We had steak instead. I understand the sh** happens, but the management can't make substitutions?   Maybe try it again, but, maybe not"}
{"text":"Unless you are looking for a bar scene - which my family and I were not - everything here is pretty much middle of the road. The food is fine and the service was OK. We could see how this place is enjoyable for those upstairs, and those at the bar watching baseball. But for a couple or a family looking for food, this is probably not the first place to try. It's not bad, but it's pretty loud and better suited for a more rambunctious crowd."}
{"text":"Great! Support this restaurant! Authentic and a great meal. Friendly service and good food."}
{"text":"I was taken here while visiting from Chicago and had one of the best margaritas of my life.  I tried the house (on ice with salt) and it was fantastic, but what I couldn't get enough of was the strawberry-lime one.  I couldn't taste a drop of alcohol...and that's when you know you have a good mixed drink on your hands. I honestly could have had three more it was so tasty, but my childlike tolerance for boozin did not allow it.    The bartender was super nice and friendly, we had many refills of the chips and salsa (damn you, I can never resist), and it was all in a southwestern chill environment.  Supposedly the tacos are top-notch, I will have to give them a whirl next time I'm in town.    I highly suggest going here for a happy hour or dinner."}
{"text":"I had my first Coronarita here any OMG it was sooooo good.  So good.  Now it was 115 degrees outside so that may have had something to do with it.  Our table loved the variety of margarita flavors, including the avocado flavor.  The chips and queso were outstanding, and my carnitas burrito was very flavorful albeit a little on the dry side, even though it was enchilada style.  We had a really fun time here, group of 7, recommend it.  It's not fast, don't come here if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Great tequila list, good happy hour/appetizers. Variety of tacos was disappointing."}
{"text":"Fun place.  Great service.  Really good unique tacos.  Waiter talked me into the Cadillac margarita, glad he did.  Awesome."}
{"text":"Honest review of the food. BEWARE!  Fellow yelpers you really let me down. I have to assume that the ratings for this place are based on the drinks or pure bribery. I was in AZ so I thought it fitting to have Mexican food. This place had some of the best reviews as far as Mexican places went on yelp and I decided to check it out.  The waitress was very pleasant. and the place was pretty much empty. I showed up around 8:30PM on a Sunday in November.  ATMOSPHERE I give them kudos for the excellent music. A mix of current tunes and some 90s favorites. They also have some great TVs. Temperature wise, even with the door open, it was a tad chilly and I wore my coat. Be it known I mentioned to the hostess when I walked in it was chilly, and after no change, I let her know I was going to get my coat, which also led to no change in the temperature. Glad I had brought it.   FOOD It started out well. I had the chips and salsa (you get green and red) I am a sucker for green salsa, and this did not disappoint. You do need to ask for the chips and salsa if you want them. I'm not the first yelper to mention this. Would be good it the management got the hint and reminded their servers to offer it. I put a little of the red salsa (which is Hot) in with the green to give it a little more zing. The chips were excellent.  Since the Tacos seemed to be all the rave on yelp (maybe because they are $1 on Tuesdays) I got the platter of 2 which comes with rice and beans. Here is what I thought: -Rice - bland, (ok, i know its rice, it wasn't bad rice, just not knocking my socks off. I liked that it was soft and not dry.) -Refried beans- also pretty unexciting, but since they were the most edible thing on my plate much of it was eaten TACOS Part One -Grilled Ono Taco - this fish taco was very dry. even adding salsa/chalula couldn't save it.  I think this taco, with the fish cooked properly could be good. -Carnitas  Taco - This shredded pork taco was insanely greasy and unexciting. One bite was all I could manage. The cilantro and onions were barely discernible accompaniments.  So the waitress comes over and asks how everything is. I take a deep breath and let her know about the tacos. She sweetly asks if she can get me anything else. Still feeling optimistic I go for 2 other tacos that she recommends which are popular ones during their happy hour. She walks away.  A gentleman comes out and explains they are going to make me some replacement tacos and apologizes. I'm not sure who he actually was. No introduction was made. I told him I was optimistic and would definitely give it another shot. Just in the name of full disclosure, the waitress knew I was a yelper. I mentioned it a few times and I was taking photos of all the food she brought out.  TACOS Part Deux In general, so many toppings were piled onto these two replacement tacos I think the chef was honestly trying to mask the mediocrity of the meat. (cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream - Taco Bell special) -Shredded Beef Taco -  beef still a little dry, which can be expected. Didn't taste the green chiles it was allegedly marinated in. Unexciting -Tinga taco - this shredded chicken taco was ok. It was marinated in chipotle sauce but was definitely still lacking something.  I have to say there was not an onion in sight within this 2nd round of tacos. I wonder if that's what was missing from the flavor. Lack of seasoning. I can't imagine this is how Southwesterners like this food.   Also, these two replacement tacos (which didn't come out with rice and beans because I said I did not require another serving) came out on a tiny plate. I need to mention that another Yelper has also complained that squeezing two tacos on a small plate is extremely unwieldy. I looked like a little kid spilling tomato and cheese all over the table. Chef - Please just plate the two tacos on a large plate.  I will probably go back one more time and try a few more just to make certain I didn't just have bad luck. It seems some of the other reviewers had tacos which I did not try. If my opinion does change I will make sure to update the review.  $12 with tax/tip. I had a water."}
{"text":"So we got there at 4 and we left 20 mins after and there happy hour is bomb. We left and walked around and by 6:55 we ran back to this place and at 6:58 I put an order and all the waiters were so nice and placed my order. They are thoughtful and nice. Waiters bartenders bus girls hostess Fatima waiter, Adam bartender and our waitress Amy, busboy Trevor, GM Jaime, you guys fucken rock !!!"}
{"text":"I like a laid back spot to watch Sunday football (with Sunday Football drink specials!) and an every day Happy Hour. How can you dislike a place like this?   All in all I really like the lay out, the server we had was extremely friendly and the food was great. I love their metal star lights, the open floor plan (the above loft is really cool) and of course a more \"modern mexican\" feel. We ordered chips and guac, their complementary salsa and a friend got the nachos. We each had a Frozen House Margarita and the bill was only $28 between the three of us.   The guacamole was really well made, nice and chunky with a good hint of lime and chopped up cilantro and tomato. The portions are massive for only paying half price! You can't go wrong with their specials with the amount of food and the strength of the booze you get.   I've only been here one other time and again had a great experience. They have various taco options that are very good--not crazily adventurous but they will hit the spot and keep you satisfied. This is a nice little addition to Old Town, whether it's for drinks, sports or a little bit of both."}
{"text":"Very cool place to grab a drink, watch a game and meet friendly people at the bar. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We called before arriving to make sue they had prickly pear margaritas. Other places had advertised the drink, but none could deliver. Not only did Cien Agaves have it, but it was one of the best I've had.   Of course, while there, we also had to sample the chips, salsa and guac. The salsa was delicious. I liked the variety. The guac was good.  Definitely take the staff's recommendation. They know what they're talking about. The staff gave us great recommendations on beverages and food.   And the t-shirts are great!!!"}
{"text":"outstanding food, our waitress was awesome. the entire staff from start to finish couldnt have been better. great place, worth the wait"}
{"text":"I've had better tacos.. margaritas did not seem to have a whole lot of tequila in them... just average Mexican."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hour restaurant here. They have great price for drinks, tacos and appetizers. Ppl are generally nice, food is good and good atmosphere. Especially I really recommend to go on Tuesday"}
{"text":"This place is saved by the salsas for the chips. Again lame tacos in the traditional non-mexican style. Nice patio to sit and relax, but they should train better their waitress."}
{"text":"Margaritas are to diiiiie for ! Go on margarita monday! They're 50% off. Taco Tuesday is ok except they only have beef on special.   Deina is the BEST. ask for her section! Super nice and on top of her game.   I highly recommend this restaurant !"}
{"text":"This is actually a 2 1/2 star review. Visited for lunch on  9/15/15 after looking at the menu and restaurant reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor. We live in Payson and the Mexican restaurants up here are pretty bad. Unfortunately, Cien Agaves was disappointing. The restaurant is kind of a Mexican Steampunk decor but we liked it well enough. We found a high-top table & server arrived in a minute or two &  asked what we wanted to drink. I asked for a minute to look at the menu. She walked away without a word. We placed our drink order....a house Margarita for me. She never asked, or provided,  any Chips & Salsa...so I had to ask for them. They have a great selection of Margaritas and tequilas as well as types of tacos. I ordered the 3 taco platter....Shredded Beef, Shrimp Taco and a Fried Fish Taco on corn tortillas...the Fish in the taco was flavorless...needed salt. The cabbage in the tacos was plain old cabbage,, not dressed with anything, bland but I liked the sauce on the Fish Taco. I couldn't eat the Shrimp Taco...just too spicy and the shrimp were just small, frozen shrimp...nothing spectular. The Shredded Beef on the taco was hard, dry and stringy...inedible. I think the Kahlua flan was old. It was way too firm...not creamy and light but I liked the flavor of it. The Green Salsa was enjoyable but the Red Salsa was too watery and too spicy for me. The House Margarita was good but needed just a bit more sweetness.. Our server was unfriendly and spent more time in the kitchen than tending to her customers. Twice I  had to ask another server to find our server...she seemed totally disinterested in providing a good experience to customers. Unlikely to return or refer anyone to Cien Agaves..."}
{"text":"Went here several Sundays ago for a brunch. Gotta say, LOVE love LOVE all of the decor! Think Latin American culture crossed w/gothic shit (i.e. colorful skulls and masks), plus it's before Halloween/Day of the Dead, soo you can see eery blood stained-stickers on the tequila posters in the bathroom. Love that touch!  I ordered the Hangover Burrito (even though I didn't have one). Was not disappointed! It weighed about 2.5 lbs (I swear) and looked like a toddler's leg. I pumped 3 solid meals out of the fried piece of heaven. Had everything AND MORE stuffed inside.  Service was ehhhhh. Maybe the gal was new, but just kind of felt she was bothered by our table and sort of \"sneery\" tude/vibe coming from her. Dunno but I still gave her decent tip.  Will be back for more fried goodness. Soon."}
{"text":"Best happy hour! You can definitely get enough to eat and drink on their happy hour menu. It's awesome that their HH goes until 7 and is even on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Friends from the area took us to Old Town to wander around and we stumbled upon Cien Agaves.  WOW! We're we impressed!  From the time we walked in until we left we were pleasantly surprised at every turn.  We just happened to have arrived on taco Tuesday to enjoy $2 shredded beef tacos and $2 Tecate but we also had tequila, margaritas and other dishes from the regular menu.  Our party shared the food and everyone was impressed.  When next we visit Arizona we WILL make this a mandatory stop.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were great, both the breaded and the grilled. Yummy. Salsa and baja sauce were HOT, HOT, HOT. Waitress seemed clueless about this and no mention of how hot it was on the menu."}
{"text":"Inside they pump the music too loud - so, sit outside on the patio underneath the stars. Guacamole with pomegranate seeds was surprisingly tasty. Prickly pear margaritas are not to be missed. Staff was friendly but lagged it a little. Overall, not a bad choice for an affordable night out in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My office and I have been hitting up Taco Tuesdays for a few month now.  There tacos are good for a dollar but you will have to contend with some HORRIFIC service to get them."}
{"text":"Cien Agaves is a funky little joint located right in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale. They are known for their tacos and tequilas... 15 different tacos and 100 varieties of tequila to be exact. It's casual, open late, and their menu was calling our name when my husband and I arrived in Scottsdale one recent evening.  We started with the tasty chips served with two salsas (one a mild red and the other a sweet verde) and chose a large margarita to split. There were also 16 different margaritas on the menu, and we went with The Local. The concoction of Cruz Silver Tequila, fresh squeezed lime juice, and triple sec was a hit with both of us. This place was beginning to feel like a \"choose your own adventure book\" meal and I was feeling adventurous!     Carrying on with our adventure, it was time to pick the entree. Being that they are known for their tacos, I went with... pasta! Just kidding. I got the tacos, silly. There are three options to choose from depending on how hungry you are. You can go with a two taco or three taco meal (served with rice and black or refried beans) or a ten taco platter. With any of the three, you can mix and match your taco selections. I picked the Tinga Taco (shredded chicken breast braised in chipotle sauce, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mexican crema in crispy corn tortilla), Pollo Asado Taco (grilled chicken breast mixed with pico de gallo, topped with guacamole in a soft flour tortilla), and Tecate Fish Taco (beer battered ono, cabbage, mango salsa, and baja sauce in a soft flour tortilla). I can't even choose a favorite, as all three were equally delicious! My husband opted for a chicken chimichanga that was filled with shredded breast meat, rice, and cheddar then topped with even more cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. It was roughly the size of a brick. I kid you not. I believe I even saw a neighboring building built out of these monsters.  After my meal, I totally feel like I chose all the right paths in my adventure book. It was so much fun, I hope to go down a few different paths sometime in the future and see where they might lead."}
{"text":"I had really hoped this place would be better since the location was great (right in the middle of Old Scottsdale) and the inside looked nice, but that was about as far as it went. Although our waitress was nice, the service took FOREVER, and the place was not even full at lunch time. $10 for a regular margarita at lunch time seemed a little pricey to me too. We split the 3 taco plate and had a fish taco, lobster taco and carne asada taco. Both the fish and lobster tacos were fried, not lightly fried, but heavily battered and greasy. The carne asada did not have a lot of flavor. Probably OK to go here in a pinch, but there are probably hundreds of places better than this!"}
{"text":"Great place for tacos and drinks. Over 100 tequila's. Service was awesome, food awesome, and atmosphere awesome. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their tacos and happy hour!!! happy hour every day so come early to get a good spot! the crunchy tacos are the best! Try the house margarita too! Will deff be heading here at least  2-3 times a month for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a solid margarita night. Love their chicken quesadillas and the fajitas are good too. Go during happy hour, such good deals. The service is great, and all of the food is awesome. Only thing on the menu I don't like is the cheese crisp, it's like a weird version of a Mexican pizza or something, pass on that."}
{"text":"Happy hour on Tuesday was better than I expected. I sat upstairs at the high top because it was busy and too hot to sit on the patio. The service from the bartender was awesome considering she was waiting on 4 tables plus the bar by herself and making drinks for the other tables.  The crispy tacos are American style with light & crispy shells (they looked made in-house) with lettuce, tomato, & shredded cheddar cheese. Also comes with cute little flags. I just wished they had more flavor. The margaritas were appropriately strong. And when my boyfriends drink slid off the slanted table, the girls were quick to clean it up, tell is it was ok, and brought a fresh one right away. Needless to say I left a good tip because it was well deserved"}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I came here and were pleasantly surprised! I ordered a house margarita, strong, but delicious! I also ordered a Blue margarita- blue curacoa, pineapple, fantastic. We both ordered the 3 taco plate with shredded beef. I read that some people think the portions are small. At first glance, they do look that way, but we were stuffed by the time we left. I even took one of mine home. Our server was very nice, very attentive, and quick! We will definitely be back again. :) Overall very fun environment, tasty food, and delicious drinks."}
{"text":"We just moved here and we've been twice already. Great happy hour prices and delicious food. The tinga tacos and fajita bowl are our favorite!"}
{"text":"The service was a little iffy. No water refills the entire time. The food was great though. Los Nachos were a great appetizer to share with the table. The Big Ass Burrito is probably the best burrito I have had, but it was a little heavy on the tortilla side. My first bite was only tortilla which was a disappointment. The rest of the burrito made up for it though. Only Mexican restaurant that I've ever been to that didn't serve chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Love, love this place. My all time favorite Mexican Restaurant in AZ. Authentic mexican food, great prices, good quality food and fun atmosphere. Only down side is if you go on the weekend at night or anytime during happy hour you can wait a good amount of time to be seated as this place is very small!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best deals in Old Town. Their happy hour is unequaled for price. We had beers and two appys and got out for $15. The green chili dip was awesome, They have tacos for a few dollars, nachos for a few dollars. We liked the nachos as well, a lot of food for the money. DO not expect Barrio Queen. Its a happy hour that won't break you. Don't propose here or anything. Well, unless you want to.  And service was great, nice décor. It is kind of like El Hefe without the craziness. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. I don't know why it took so long to find this place, for our \"pre paycheck\" outings."}
{"text":"First time. Enjoyed our visit and food. Smokin' happy hour prices. Will certainly stop back and just buy happy hour appetizers and drink margaritas."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink on our first visit here. We live in Litchfield Park and are exploring the area. Old town is touristy but cool.  I'm a big tequila fan and Cien Agaves offers over 100 tequilas! I was tempted to try them all but only had the house margarita which they claim is the best in town. I'd like to say it was the best house margarita I've ever had.   I also ordered the happy hour special tacos. They were well made and delicious. We were pleased with this pub and will return very soon."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre, but the happy hour was amazing. Unfortunately our waiter got my order wrong and my dates drinks wrong, twice. I didn't complain about my food being wrong, i just picked off what wasn't supposed to be on there. My date took the beer that was given to him , even though it was the wrong choice. Then ordered a second margarita and the server didn't ring it in until we asked him 10 mins later where the drink was. Our server was very apologetic and told us not to worry about the margarita and it was on him. When we got the bill we were delightfully surprised he also comped the beer and took $$ off my order that was wrong. He was great and it was unexpected - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I recommend mainly for the fish tacos and VERY AWESOME margs.  I do love them margs here.  It's one of my two \"go-to\" marg spots in Old Town Scottsdale (the other being The Mission).  Happy hour is the beset value, and my family and friends LOVE the crispy chicken $2.00 Tinga Tacos they have during happy hour.  I've been here numerous times, at various times of happy hour, and my sister (who LOVES this place) had her graduation party upstairs.  That was very nice.  Them margs will kick your ass.  Prickly Pear is nice, as is the Cadillac, and the organic marg is a treat as well.  Interior looks like it's off the set of The Peach Pit from Melrose Place in Mexico City.  Outside patio is nice, especially in spring/fall at the fire pit.  No matter what, I always seem to come back.  Waiting to get a glimpse of Tori Spelling lurking in the back..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good service, and great happy hour specials. This is in the heart of old town, but it's not so hip that you'll have to wait a long time to be seated unless you're with a large party.  They can make several of their bowls vegan. The avocado and beets bowl is really good.   This is a good casual date spot and also good for entertaining out of towners in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"YUM! I was so pleasantly surprised by this place. I am weary of Mexican food that is smack right in the middle of old town. In many cases they are only places to get drunk or they are super gimmicky.   Cien Agaves had perfect food and drinks while staying reasonably priced.   We were there for happy hour and sat up at the bar. The bartender was completely cool.   I had the tostadas which was an enormous serving and a potato cheese taco. Tostadas were loaded with beans, cheese, lettuce, cabbage and I topped it off with their delicious salsa. When I had their potato taco I thought I had died and went to heaven. My husband had the ceviche and tinga tacos, which he said was excellent.  Their house margarita was on special for happy hour... I'm usually weary of house margaritas. They are either too sweet or not strong enough. But these were great!  We will definitely be back! I want to try their veggie tacos...."}
{"text":"I hope you like 90's alternative music if you're going here. Lots of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Sublime playing in the background.   Moving on to more important topics - food & Margs. Both were delicious. Got the shrimp, carnitas & tinga tacos and the shrimp fajitas. Definitely would recommend if you're looking for some good mexican food & margaritas to match!"}
{"text":"The menu is HUGE and their tequila list is super extensive. I can never get enough of their guac and their happy hour specials are really amazing. I've never had to wait for a table and the service has always been really attentive and friendly. I recommend this restaurant to all my friends and I take my family when they are in town."}
{"text":"Visited on April 28 with a party of 7. Arrived at 7pm and should have paid attention to the fact that the place was only about half full. It wasn't a bad meal, it just wasn't a great one.  Drinks-house margaritas are half price until 7pm. We were able to take advantage of that which was a good thing since they were not very strong.  Food-chips and salsa (green and red) are complimentary, but are not brought to the table automatically, you have to ask. And you have to ask for refills on the salsa. Both salsas were very good, nice and fresh. The red salsa was spicy, which I love.  The chips were sub par in my opinion. Some crunchy, some chewy and tough.   Everyone at our table ordered a variation of the two taco meal. The variety of taco options was very good.  I had a carnitas one and a shredded beef one. Carnitas one was very taste, and I liked that I got the option of a soft corn tortilla instead of flour. The beef taco was served in a special shell, I did not care for it. It was a fried corn tortilla that was a little hard to bite into, and did not have a very good taste.    I love trying New Mexican places when traveling, this one unfortunately was a slight disappointment."}
{"text":"Just arrived in Scottsdale and a bartender recommended this place for tacos. We didn't get the tacos which looked great as they went by.  Had a chimichanga and a burrito.  No side rice or beans? Average"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the most disappointing taco bar ever.  Looked promising on the outside.  Street tacos were skimpy on the protein portions,  way too sweet of garnish in most cases, and the grilled fish taco was incredibly bitter.  We loved this concept at Joyride Tacos but not so much here."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch spot for our family. The margaritas were great. The food looked spectacular - but the flavors were just a little below par."}
{"text":"We were really pleased that we stumbled on to this place. It happened to be happy hour & the prices were very good. For dinner we had a ahi, shrimp, and grilled fish tacos & a chipotle chicken quesadilla. The habenero margarita was delicious and not as hot as I expected. Loved  the up beat atmosphere. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here was very good.  They also have an excellent tequila menu.  The service was a little grumpy but I found that in almost all of the restaurants in Scottsdale, must be a Scottsdale thing."}
{"text":"This is an awesome mexican restaurant. The food was wonderful and the staff went out of their way to give us a memorable experience. We had reservations , and the table was not vacating. We waited 20 min. The staff set up a delightful table for 7 people outside,they brought in heaters and lit the Fire pit. Lovely atmosphere for making us wait. The staff, brought us delicious apps. And after our meal they brought desserts. Very kind of our waiter Connor, who took good care of us. Thanks Connor for a great night."}
{"text":"Happy hour is too good to miss! Food is pretty standard (good) Mexican with a solid location and great specials."}
{"text":"We came back to this place for the second time for a happy hour. The waiter was very nice and the food was OK. Some good deals. Very loud but they have a cool bar area upstairs, that is very nice. I'll go back to keep some variety but nothing special."}
{"text":"Awesome tequila list. Enjoyed variety of tasty tacos. Friendly and fast service. Staff opened early when they saw a line starting outside. That is impressive customer service."}
{"text":"So good! And the staff was super knowledgeable about the tequilas! The carnitas tacos were tender and delicious and the guac was spicy and perfect!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner for the first time over halloween weekend. Our server was great! She was very attentive, knowledgable, and fast. The tacos were rather spicy. With all the Halloween dressed individuals, the service was still great, and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had 3 of the best tacos of my life here! Island shrimp taco, Al Pastor (with pineapple!), and the tinga taco pretty much blew me away. And you cannot beat the Sunday $5 milagro margarita deal. Great cantina vibe in this joint, plus plenty of screens to watch football on Sundays. And best of all, the salsa was actually spicy!"}
{"text":"This place has great margaritas and tacos!!! Audra was our server- whom was amazing! Audra  brought our service dog a bowl of water and we sat inside.  We will be back here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. I had chicken tacos and my husband had chicken fajitas! We left with smiles on our faces and full bellies. I highly recommend this Old Town Scottsdale special."}
{"text":"Definitely a MUST try! Great service! Awesome HH from 3-7 with half off apps and hours margaritas. Join me next time!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't go in the last hour they are open because I just had a very mediocre service and the thing was our server was friendly her name is Kylie but it took forever to get greeted forever to get chips for ever to get refills and she never even bussed our tables left our dirty plates there the entire time.   The food was really good otherwise it probably get it one or two stars in fact I got the extra third start just because the churros Sunday was so amazing  Someone did say in Kylie's defense she was the only server in the whole restaurant I don't know but that shouldn't be my problem anyways. There was a Giants night game so they should of staffed accordingly"}
{"text":"I ordered food for take out. I got two tacos, the shredded beef and the carnitas. The carnitas was very good. It was very overpriced, though. It would be a good date spot. I was looking for authentic and cheap, this was not the place for that. But, like I said, it was good and would make a nice date spot."}
{"text":"I like this place. It has a good feel and delicious margaritas. If I were back in Old Town, I might stop by. But I am sure every neighborhood has their own margarita spot that is quite similar. There is no reason to drive for miles to get here."}
{"text":"I'm craving a Tinga taco just writing this review.  I love Cien Agaves' tacos!  You can order them individually, as part of a meal with beans and rice, or a platter of 10 for $35.  Pork, carne asada, chicken, potato, lobster..you name it, they have it.  Whether you like mild or spicy, are not a meat eater, whatever... You'll find the perfect taco for you.  Their patio is basically a narrow walkway with wobbly tables.  That's the only negative here in my book."}
{"text":"Decent food and service..did a tequila tasting and the vendors were extremely stingy..maybe next time they ask the vendors to give at least half an ounce?  I'll give them one more chance.."}
{"text":"This place is definitely under rated. I had the 2$ shrimp tacos on Tuesdays. It was worth more than I paid for it. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"An awesome place for Taco Tuesdays.  I went to two different Mexican food places during my stay in AZ for Taco Tuesdays and Cien Agaves was wayyy better.  The tacos were delicious.  Add in a $2 brew and I was a happy camper.  Service was better than most. Very upbeat restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want to try some of the best margaritas for the best price you have to come here.  The happy hour is awesome. My boyfriend did the tequila challenge and now his Photo is displayed at the bar. They have really good tacos as well."}
{"text":"Sat at bar and had the best service.  Terrific bartender. Great margaritas too!  Didn't eat and was just there for drinks but everyone around us were ordering food and seemed to enjoy it!  Will have to dine there the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"We had an after our rehearsal dinner meet up here with all of our friends who were in town and weren't invited to the dinner. We called ahead and reserved (although not exclusively) the top floor for our party. A bunch of friends decided to stop by before hand for food and were raving about it! The rest of us came over in huge groups from the dinner and the staff was ready for us.  Upstairs, we had two bartenders and the manager informed me that she had chips and salsa out for everyone to snack on...even though we just ate, everyone appreciated the thought and they were gobbled up! The bartenders were bad ass! They handled the massive wave of people like pros and had smiles on their faces the whole time. Thank you guys so much for doing such a great job with our party!  I had actually been here 3 years ago when I first moved and remember really enjoying the food as well, but the decor and service is what reminded me of how great this place is both for just hanging out and having a huge get together. I would highly recommend the top floor for a group like ours as long as you plan ahead and coordinate with their team because they are happy to accommodate and I would recommend stopping in even for a drink since they have some killer margaritas!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great street taco look no further..CIEN AGAVES has them.  Their entire street taco menu is mouth watering however I can never stray from the lobster tacos.  This place is a great place to go to before an afternoon Spring Training baseball game.  Their three tequilla taster is also a good way to sample the tequilla, if I can remember it is around $16 for 3 shots (heavy pour) of tequilla for sipping.  This place continues to get better and better and the service I recieve there is how any place in Scottsdale should be."}
{"text":"Loved the happy hour specials! Between the two of us, my boyfriend and I were able to enjoy two of the Cien Agave Margaritas, a Tecate beer, the Guacamole appetizer, the Nachos appetizer, a Tinga taco and a Diablo taco all for under $35.00. Will definitely return to Cien Agaves when I'm back in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"So many great things to say about this place where do I begin....  WITH THE HOUSE MARGARITAS OF COURSE!! Hands down THE best house margarita I have EVER had. No syrups or mixes, this is straight tequila and lime juice baby, very refreshing and delicious! And for 4 bucks on a Monday evening, how can you go wrong?  Their specials are all very good: Margarita Monday (as mentioned) with half price Apps, and Taco Tuesday with their dollar tacos and $2 tecate's...HELL YA.   They have a great range of tacos here and all are pretty delicious. Try the nachos with Al Pastor on them too, delicioso! Their chips and salsas also kick ass.   If youre looking for a low key place to hang out, snack, and drink then you'll enjoy this place and if you love margarita's then you'll REALLY enjoy this place"}
{"text":"I checked Cien Agaves out with a coworker last night and we LOVED IT. First things first: everything tastes very fresh. The salsas and chips were great, and we tried the cucumber margarita, prickly pear margarita, and the habanero marg, and they were all good, made with the veg/fruit/pepper FRESH.  We just had nachos but they were plentiful and mighty tasty. Big fat slices of jalapenos on top and visually appealing.   The ambience isn't uniform in places (mixing early 90's modern furniture with homestyle Mexican decor and art), but it's just subtle enough to not be incredibly annoying. The male staff were very cool and relaxed, but the females were a little bit \"in the way\"... eavesdropping, it seems. We were one of 2 couples in the bar, though...  Regardless, this place deserves 5 stars. It's a very delicious, very easy Mexican choice in downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great Mexican joint in Old Town Scottsdale! Visited last night with my friend and we were pleasantly surprised. There was a 30 minute wait since we didn't have a reservation, but we decided to sit in the bar instead. At first the service was a little slow, but as dinner went on it was much better.   We both just ordered soda, so I cannot comment on the margaritas, but the bartender was cranking them out and they all looked delicious! Such a variety of tequila and drinks on their menu.   We started with the guacamole which was very fresh and topped with pomegranate seeds. It's the perfect combination! Their salsas were a little too watery, but good flavor.   There were so many things on the menu that we wanted to try, but decided on the Steak Burrito with refried beans and the Combo #5. The burrito was huge and covered with red enchilada sauce. The steak was cooked well and the beans were definitely homemade which is a huge plus for me. The Combo #5 was a Tinga taco, cheese enchilada, beans and rice. Everything was a hit!  Will definitely return to try some of the tacos and the happy hour which is every day from 3-7pm!"}
{"text":"Solid happy hour! Great food and drink specials. I really love the art on the walls."}
{"text":"Since we found this place a few years ago, we come every time we're in Scottsdale. The tequila selection is the best around and the hosts are always very knowledgeable and helpful in offering suggestions. Plus the food is amazing. I always have a chimichanga, my wife and kids get other dishes, and we all get some appetizers--everyone absolutely loves everything we order. Love, love, love this place."}
{"text":"We went here for my sons 8th birthday. The food was great and so was the service! It wasn't overly expensive either and the noise level was moderate. I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to stop in this place for HH for awhile and I FINALLY did recently. Unfortunately, our group came here AFTER trying HH someplace else first where we were less than impressed, yet had a couple drinks and a little food in us, so I didn't try as much as I would have liked to.   The only food I had was the queso dip and it was SO GOOD! We ordered two servings for 6 people and I'm pretty sure I ate almost an entire order myself. Oops. The green chile pork added into it was delicious!  One of the girls I was with had a couple tacos and she said they were very good. I hear the guac hear is delicious, and I'd like to come back for it.   I obviously had a margarita as well. It was good, and tasted even better half price during HH :)  The restaurant itself is nice. It's two stories and I believe there's a bar on both stories. Lot's of seating and our service was great.   I'll come back."}
{"text":"It's Friday afternoon beautiful day out decided to walk down the street from our home in old town! Took the kids out enjoyed a walk so we decided to come in here. It was busy, had to give the hostess number of party and our number to call. So finally half hr later. Went back. The hostess had to find a table. She said \"ok we have a table upstairs\" mind you it's three adults and two kids. So we go upstairs. She literally seats us in a table of 4 ALL the way in the corner like we were on punishment. These tables are super small and good for 4 people. My husband  is a big guy there was no way we can all fit in. So finally we decided to just get up and leave. When we told the \"hostess\" how can she seat 5 people in a 4 seat table she said that was all they had. Are you kidding. You couldn't tell us this the moment we decided to be on the waiting list. The hostess are terrible. They need to change up whoever is in the front dealing and figure out a better communication with the customers. It was pretty disappointing that was her answer instead of helping and wanting to make us happy."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  We have visited this place several ties, and at different times - always fun.  Food is good, and their selection of flavored margaritas is very creative.  Service is very good too."}
{"text":"This is a great place for happy hour any day of the week! There house margaritas are amazing (made with freshly squeezed limes), guac is yummy, and so are their tacos. If you find yourself in old town Scottsdale it is worth a stop in"}
{"text":"The five stars are for: prompt service, pleasant and courteous staff, for placing a Mexico! flag on my taco, and for having hot salsa that was actually HOT! The atmosphere here is contagiously fun and with the skulls everywhere and mexican decor adding to the vibe, I felt I had been transported to Mexico minus being frisked by the border patrol.  The shrimp taco was full of zesty full-sized shrimps and was spicy. The shredded beef taco and the chicken one didn't disappoint either. Best of all the shells were fried and crunchy which added to the zesty tasty explosion going on in my mouth! I would definitely come back here if I were visiting Old Town Scottsdale again.  Edit: I believe the actual HOT salsa did cost $0.75 more... but definitely worth it if you're up to the challenge!"}
{"text":"The nachos were so good... I am a picky eater but they were very accommodating... I was able to get my nachos with just chicken and cheese... The amount of nachos on the plate was insane... Two people could have eaten it....the margaritas were good too... The waiter was very attentive"}
{"text":"Great white sangria and margaritas!!!  We went for dinner, but ended up ordering appetizers and a pitcher of white sangria. All I can say is the service was great but the drinks are amazing!!!  The tortilla chips  were fresh and homemade.  The ceviche was so tasteful!"}
{"text":"This place is of the charts good. My bartender, Wyatt, was the most refined scholar and gentleman I have had the pleasure to be served tequila by.  The owner even stopped by to ask how I was doing. It was like I had known him for years.  I told him I was doing \"f-ing great\". I like to see an owner that gets out on the floor and gets his hands dirty.  All nice people serving very good food .  Get the cucumber margarita, but only if you want your life changed forever (in a good way)."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, chips, and queso. Tacos were fine but nothing to write home about. My husband liked the enchiladas, though. Kid friendly but not a kid restaurant, which is our preference. We sat inside, but the patio looked fun as well. The server was nice but busy."}
{"text":"The reason for the 3 stars is because they really do have a killer happy hour and the location is great. Half off all appetizers until 7PM and discounted margaritas. I'm not a fan of margaritas but my friend ordered one and she said it wasn't bad. I ordered a blackberry mojito and it was the most tart drink I have ever had, would not recommend. Nachos were just alright. Guac was great!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I am impressed. The salads here are amazing, and I love the atmosphere (especially the mango vinaigrette dressing), as it is very funky and bright. This looks like a great place for happy hour. I have eaten on the patio, and that is very nice too with lots of shade. I also had the chicken tortilla soup which was great with an avocado slice in there and a small drop of sour cream. It had a nice kick of spice! The prices are great and portions are hefty!"}
{"text":"Comparable to my favorite Mexican restaurant back home, this authentic eatery features a wide selection of traditional favorites and a good selection of beer, cocktails, etc. We were seated outside in an alley way type setting which had a very nice feel to it. Though it was a chilly desert night, they had propane powered, heated lamps keeping guests warm. They also provided free chips and salsa with not one, but two distinct flavors - mild verde and a medium traditional salsa. The chimichanga I had was a new taste for me compared to the same dish I had back at home. The meat was rich and flavorful and not mushed like back home in NJ. Great presentation on it and two different sauces as well (server offer each one or both...both, duh).  My wife had a chicken quesadilla and she enjoyed it as well. We are only spending a weekend in Scottsdale and the restaurants we pick are somewhat of a hit or miss but this was definitely a nice hit. We enjoyed it and didn't find out until later the popularity of this place.   Recommended for any first time visitors to the area and of course the locals too. Good shopping in area as well. Easy access to dessert across the street at the infamous Sugar Bowl of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I typically hate everything in Old Town, but who can hate a Mexican restaurant that's open late, serves a huge variety of drinks, has great and imaginative tacos, can accommodate those who eat clean.  The lean green bowl is black beans, Greek yogurt, roasted veggies, tomatoes and lime quinoa. It's outstanding and even better with shrimp for a few bucks more.  Ahi tuna tacos also are terrific."}
{"text":"Wow - how have I walked by this place on so many vacations and not stopped in? It blows other Scottsdale Mexican food out of the water.   If I lived here, I would be there every Monday for shrimp tacos (2 bucks!!!) and 6 dollar BEER-A-RITAS - they have taco Tuesdays as well... Both types of shrimp are amazing - one is just grilled shrimp and rice - simple but tasty - and the other is kinda of a fried Asian-y shrimp with cabbage, also killer.   I didn't like their other stuff as much, but still good. The carne asada was steam, just nothing to write home about,. I really liked their crispy chicken taco, and the chorizo and potato taco is a great idea but falls flat because the chorizo is sort of bland - which is strange for a place I found all their food to be sort of spicy.   Came back for lunch our last day before leaving, I will definitely be back! ."}
{"text":"Waitress was wonderful, music not too loud, habanero margarita was delicious and the tacos were meal sized!  Great spot!"}
{"text":"Food fun and great service totally recommend. Really a fun place don't let the name fool You very family friendly appreciative and accommodating"}
{"text":"My Husband and I stopped into the restaurant for lunch on a January afternoon.  We were greeted by our server Ashley who was very friendly.  I started with a Habanero Margarita and it was great and I also had an organic margarita which was also good and not too sweet.  The Camarones A La Diabla  and the Taco Al Pastor were both great choices.  My husband and I also had a flight of Tequila and our server put it together for us with the most popular, server favorite and bartender favorite.  They were very good choices.  There is 100 tequila selections ranging in price and it was nice to have a server that seemed to be knowledgeable on tequilas."}
{"text":"Best service! Even on taco Tuesday when its absolute chaos inside! We had the best tacos and margaritas served by bartender and server Danielle! Will definitely be here more often!"}
{"text":"I happened upon this place via UberEats one Saturday night. Ordered the fajitas and was pleasantly surprised by how good they were. The vegetables were good perfectly and the entree had a nice charred flavor that I like.   I have ordered a few additional times through UberEats, but only after I called to ask them to become available on the app. I would continue ordering from them, but I'm not going to keep calling to ask them to turn on the app."}
{"text":"My wife and I chose Cien Agaves for lunch during our visit to Old Town Scottsdale.  We found it was a great spot for lunch.  I found the interior very bar-like and pretty loud but that's fine for lunch.    I was really impressed by their tequila selection and we had two fabulous margaritas during lunch.  My wife absolutely loved the cucumber margarita.  I was a bit skeptical but I did enjoy it.  Especially considering it was 108 outside!     The ceviche was really tasty but the shrimp could have been cut up smaller.  It kept falling off our chips and was much larger than the rest of the ceviche.  We had three different tacos and all were really good and not your typical fare.  I'd say the Taco al Pastor was my favorite but my wife really enjoyed the veggie tacos with the sauteed veggies for the filling.  The other thing to note about the tacos was that there were at least 10 different types.  I wanted to try them all out (just like the margaritas) but that'll have to wait for another time.  Don't know how this place would do for dinner.  I'd highly recommend it for the margaritas and the tacos were good but it's more of a casual place.  The price also seemed okay considering how good the margaritas were but it's not cheap.  We spent $50 for 2 margaritas, 3 tacos and the ceviche.  We had good tequila in the margs so there were in the $9-11 range.  We would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Their fajita bowls are my fav healthy-ish meal in old town and it's still very tasty! Monday's have great deals as well!"}
{"text":"A few friends, my husband and I met up here on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. Arrived before happy hour ended, so enjoyed some guac and chips and a Dos Equis before the real meal. I had a fajita salad with chicken. The lettuce and veggies were fresh and the mango-pineapple vinaigrette was great! My husband had 2 Tinga tacos and they seemed a bit small; you'd think 2 tacos would be enough to fill you up but he was still hungry after finishing them. We stayed for almost an hour and a half just enjoying each other's company and the service was good the whole time."}
{"text":"We've been to Cien countless times since my initial review of the place over three (!) years ago. Food is always consistently good and service can usually handle any issue/crowds. We dropped by last spring during a gigantic street fest and even though we were wedged in a corner on their top floor, we still received food and drinks with prompt service.  BUT, what gave me pause on our most recent trip is a new addition to their menu: BOWLS. (\"bowls, bowls, all types of bowls...chips and mints and seashell bowls\")   More specifically: The Beats by Cien (cute) bowl. You guys, this is a freaking treat, and one you wouldn't expect to stumble upon in a little taco shack in Old Town: roasted red and gold beets, grape tomatoes, grilled corn and chimichurri are all mashed around in some avocado and served upon a bed of shaved sauteed-warm Brussels and dried cranberries. The flavors and textures are outstanding. I think my beloved papas con queso tacos have competition in my heart, and it's this meal."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is my one of my main reasons for living. They have an amazing happy hour on Tuesday where tacos are $2 and house margaritas are $3.50. If you need a good place to be obnoxious and talk shit, this is the place as it is LOUD. During their rush, service can be kind of slow and you have to ask for free chips and salsa to be delivered to your table. (I am of the mind that all restaurants, Mexican food or no Mexican food, should serve free chips and salsa. But I digress.)   For the price and the location, you can't beat it. Thank you Cien Agaves for helping me tolerate the rest of  my work week after getting drunk on your extremely cheap and tasty margaritas on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Always a great time at cien! From the service to their food you can't go wrong with anything. Try their taco stand they have a variety of tacos to choose from. Great happy hour EVERYDAY 3-7"}
{"text":"Great food! Great staff! Great service! It's a small place that gets very busy so be patient when waiting but the food and drinks are so worth it! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. I'm one for good service and this place wasn't it. It took the server 20 minutes to come greet us and take our drink order. Server never gave her name or the specials for taco Tuesday. We had to go to the bar to get water and call her over to get our check. The food was amazing however. The house margaritas weren't anything special.. A little to sweet for my liking."}
{"text":"Fantastic margaritas complemented by excellent food selections. A healthy variety of tacos which can be mixed and matched. The chimichanga was just the right level of spice. And, oh the great margaritas. Highly recommend the Cadillac. And save room for the desserts. This is an excellent night life hang out on weekends, or a pleasant dinner for two during the week."}
{"text":"This place is definitely 5 Star's.  Traditional Mexican food with your average atmosphere seems to be the standard here in the valley.  Cien Agaves goes above and beyond and really doesn't even compare.  Their taco's are amazing!  Except for a few apps, I haven't even tried anything else that's how good their tacos are!!  Their fresh squeezed lime Margarita's are mouth watering.  Atmosphere and Service were both top of the line.  Trust me... I'm a native of AZ and have been to many Mexican Food Restaurants... GO TO CIEN AGAVES!!!  You wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Went there for Taco Tuesday and was surprised when they asked us if we had a reservations.  We got a seat right away in the self-seating bar area, but it was the last table available.  Cool atmosphere and decor.  Only had the margaritas and chips and salsa.  Chips and salsa was good.  Margaritas were a bit sweet, but they were large and only $3.50.  Seemed like a fun little place, but I hated my date.  I'll go back there and explore a little more when I'm with people I like and I'll update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"went here tonight. great place in old downtown Scottdale. i got the fajita bowl with a beer garita and both were great. service was just as good and pricing was reasonable while leaving with a full stomach."}
{"text":"Food was OK at best but the vibe is cool. Was a bit empty for a Friday night. I don't think I'd return but was worth a visit!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally made it to Old town Scottsdale and saw this taco place right away. We were not disappointed, the tacos were great and not to high priced concidering where we were. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lunch on Friday, March 9. Two tacos with rice and beans for each of us. One margarita for each of us. Taco plate was overpriced, but I knew that when I ordered. God bless them for getting as much as they can. However, as tasty as the tacos were, the beans were in need of more salt and the rice was BARELY room temperature. The homemade margarita mix was delicious, but how about being able to recognize that there is some tequila in them - must have been the smallest shot glass on earth. Service was good and the ambience was excellent. If I want a taco, I'll go back for happy hour when they're $3, not $4.75."}
{"text":"OMG the happy hour special is great, and their tacos are DELICIOUS!  Not to mention the tequila selection.  KILLER shrimp taco.  I could have eaten my weight in those suckers!  Nice service.  Its dark but spacious.  Nice place for a quick meal and some venom..."}
{"text":"If you're coming for drinks (specifically for margaritas), this is the place. Cien Agaves has a large amount of tequilas and variety of margaritas at a reasonable price.  The tacos are just OK and I feel that they're a bit small for the price. Some, (salmon for example) were tasteless.  The chips and salsa were delicious and I love that they give you both a green and red salsa.  All in all, it's much better than Salty Senorita."}
{"text":"Hear ye hear ye, no booze in the happy hour margarita ! If you're gonna have one you best be getting an extra shot of tequila to add to that or snap... You won't feel a buzz . The menu specifically says all margs are made to order however I watched this come out of a pre mixed jug. No Bueno victor ;)"}
{"text":"I typically love this place but we went last weekend and had the slowest and crappiest service I've had at a restaurant in quite a while. They were out of certain menu items, took forever to take orders or come to check on us, didn't follow through with requests, we were there for 3.5 hours with no water service, had to ask for a to go box 3 times. Slow and really really poor attitude. Food was decent, the usual."}
{"text":"Appetizers were half price!!! Ceviche was delicious Queso with pork Chorizo pizza Shredded chicken taco! It was sooo good!!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered a grilled mahi mahi taco and grill corn for side. This is absolutely stunning. Fish was grilled to perfection and corn has a nice char and sweet. This is one of the place that I will definitely come back for. Restaurant environment was comfortable. Nice ambiance music and just at the right volume. Friendly service. What else can you ask for when you are hungry at night."}
{"text":"I had an amazing time at Cien Agaves during my visit to Arizona! Not only are the margaritas AMAZING but the wait staff and management are absolutely incredible. The atmosphere is relaxing and I loved the decor. I cannot wait for my next trip out to Phoenix so I can enjoy the wonderful company and delicious margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"Cien Agaves is a very nice Mexican restaurant in old town scottsdale.   Margaritas were very good and refreshing on a hot summer day like yesterday and the food was delicious.   There were plenty of choices for vegetarians like me.  \"Service with a smile\" definitely made the experience an awesome one and will definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"Truly bad service. I'm visiting from out of town and after confirming the reservation they 'called' to cancel. As I'm living abroad couldn't get the message and happens that they were 'apologetic' but we just were left without a reservation  Very underwhelming"}
{"text":"I love this place! When we went for lunch the place was relatively empty, but filled up quickly. Their shrimp tacos are amazing! I would get them again in a heartbeat. Queso dip is a must and a nice cold margarita! They have so many margarita options an the service was great. I would go back any time!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas and amazing tacos. I recommend the carnita's taco. I hope to get back to Scottsdale soon so I can stop by again."}
{"text":"The Beets by Ren Bowl was really good. The fish taco and taco salad were pretty plain. The regular margarita was too sweet. I liked the skinny margarita (asked them to not make it sweet)."}
{"text":"This will be a quickie. I stopped in last night with a friend to see if this place was any good and worth checking out again. We had already eaten, so we just had chips and salsa and a margarita. I plan on returning to sample the menu, but until then I'm giving this a pass fail sort of review.  It passed.  Service was good and the place is nice inside. The chips and salsa were okay. I wasn't blown away by the salsa, but I enjoyed it. That's more than I can say for most places. The house margarita was merely okay as well. Nothing special. It was served in a stupid shaped glass which was annoying, but I drank it and can't complain.  I'll return sometime soon for a full meal, but I'm not going to bank on this place topping my list of great Mexican food. The search continues."}
{"text":"Have been coming to Cien Agaves for quite some time now. Food has always been consistently good, and so has the service. I usually bring family here when they come into town. The chicken tinga tacos are not like my mom's but they are definitely amazing. i HIGHLY recommend the chorizo cheese crisp, if they still have it. Of course, lets not forget the margaritaaas!"}
{"text":"This Old Town Scottsdale Bar and Grill is a great place to watch a sporting event on a big screen TV. The happy hour menu is an obscenely good deal, and you can easily get a full meal for a fraction of what you would expect it to cost. The eclectic atmosphere gives this place some personality, and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Mayb need to b back for happy hour to see if I can up my rating, but for now this is all!   Ambience - ok  Service - meh Margarita - meh Food - meh Price- ok, but for bad quality they offer it's high  We had a bad waitress, I think her name was naomi, never introduced herself, found it on the check, which was the only time she actually smiled, bcs ofc she needs tips, but for what? She never made me feel welcome, didn't make my day any better, screwed up my order & never spent an extra second with me? In fact towards the end I asked the helper boy for everything and gave him a few $ tip.   I got a cucumber margarita after reading recommendations, which was just meh. Probably would hav been better if frozen. The price doesn't justify it. Macayos or ze tejas has Better ones.  I am a vegetarian, so decided to get veggie fajitas with black beans and corn tortillas. Fajitas were so bland and had no flavor whatsoever. I could stir fry these veggies in my home to taste better. Even a sports bar like Gallaghers has better fajitas than here. Black beans was a disaster, it was just cooked bland beans, no flavor, no salt, nothing at all. Is this supposed to b a joke, or they don't care much about vegetarians? Bcs my gf loves her meat tacos. I am defntly hoping to hear from the owner/manager about this!!   And ofc the corn tortillas never arrived, instead came the flour tortillas, down went my calorie count. Thanks cien agaves, not sure why u r trying to copy tortilla factory? Not coming back soon, unless forced to!!  Check the posted pics along with review"}
{"text":"We live in Old Town and have been on several occasions over the last month. Great happy hour with freshly made guacamole and appetizers half price. The servers are cheery even when there is a large crowd. For those of us who like the Tex Mex variety this will whet your appetite. The cheese enchiladas are delicious and the menu has many taco choices. Wish they had beer on tap, but the house margaritas are special. Ask to sit in the courtyard, it is a sliver between two buildings with a great atmosphere, heaters and a fire pit. It is a great place to bring friends which we plan to do next week. Two types of salsa for salsa fans, red and green. Great job Cien A"}
{"text":"The Queso Verde here was pretty good, and given what I've tried, their appetizers in general are up to par. However, the Tinga tacos were not completely cooked, and the corn tortillas were a bizarre consistency (not as soft as flour but not very crunchy either). All in all, definitely not a go-to for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much for this restaurant, but we were blown away! Happy hour was great - especially the margaritas! All dinners were large portions and everything tasted fresh. Very reasonably priced as well. Would recommend for anyone!!"}
{"text":"I had a lunch with some friends over $1 tacos.  The scenery, the tacos, the grease...all good.  $1 fried tacos were well worth every penny.  Crispy fried tacos.  Not an every day indulgence but tasty nonetheless.  The place has a bit of a funky atmosphere, the service was very good.  I would return for Tuesday $1 Tacos.  I am betting Cien Agaves is pretty busy on Friday & Saturday nights.  Did I mention the $1 tacos were fried?  Very filling.  That was the first time I've had fried tacos.  And I thought tacos were nearly a perfect food."}
{"text":"Dry tacos. Slow service. Great atmosphere.   This literally sums up our experience. Wish I would have looked on Yelp before eating here."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit to Cien Agaves. I met a group of people for happy hour. The decor is nice and the patio is awesome! they even have a fire pit. This however, is where the positives end.   I arrived at 550. I finally was able to pin down a server at 615. I ordered a house margarita, a shrimp taco, and a chicken taco. At 645 other people who arrived after I placed my order receive their food. I said something to the person who brought their food about how long it was taking for my tacos and he respond in a rude tone \"the kitchen is very busy\". I explained that I had ordered 15 minutes before the food that had just arrived and he just walked away. A while later (655) my tacos came out and the ingredients inside the tortilla were cold. The margarita was watered down and the cold congealing tacos were mushy and salty. Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"They have quite the tequila menu. The tacos are real good. Chips n salsa was good."}
{"text":"I can appreciate a good happy hour, and Cien Agaves certainly has a muy bueno one.  While I didn't come on Taco Tuesday (which I should have for their $1 tacos and $2 Tecates), I did come for Margarita Monday (ok, I made that up - margaritas here are a must every day of the week). We came in before their daily happy hour ended at 7pm and enjoyed some awesome house margies for half price - $3.50! And these suckers were pretty big too.   Food was delicioso. I had a carnitas burrito and went with our server's rec to get it enchilada style and got the spicy red sauce. I'm glad I did, because it was so good wet (hmm, TWHS). Their signature chicken fajitas were really tasty as well. Entrees were so big that I couldn't imagine getting any appetizers or dessert - although an after dinner shot of tequila? Si, senor! Obviously, they had a list of cien tequilas on their menu. As much as I love Clase Azul, we decided to get shots of Milagro Anejo and saved ourselves $400.  All in all, a fun spot in Old Town Scottsdale to get your Mex fix!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go for casual Mexican food. Their margaritas are amazing. It's nice to see them use fresh lime. The staff is fun and I always have a good time when I go here with my friends.  The chicken tacos are my favorite"}
{"text":"Chips and tacos are must haves - the margaritas looked great as well! Chipotle chicken quesadilla was okay. Stay away from the sangria- wasn't fresh or that good. Overall above average!"}
{"text":"Great food, happy and helpful staff and fantastic happy hour prices! A must see anytime you're in Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Food is great, drinks are great, happy hour was great.... However, I wasn't a huge fan of the \"service.\" When we got there we were offered a booth, but we had to be done before an hour as they had a reservation. So, because we didn't want to feel rushed we agreed to either wait or go to another table; they seated us in the bar area at a high top. It did take forever to get chips and salsa but that's the only complaint that I have regarding the actual service at the table..... However, as one of the bartenders checked on us to see if we needed anything else, we ordered another round of drinks and were then informed that they had a private party coming in and they wanted to clear the area within 15 minutes. So, basically, hurry up and get out...   I mentioned the fact that it happened when we first got there and the bartender laughed it off and continued on.... Honestly, I felt as if our patronage was not appreciated and we were a bother."}
{"text":"This is how you do it.  Walk to the bar.  Order 3 island shrimp tacos with flour tortillas and a Cadillac margarita.  Then sit back and mark this review as useful."}
{"text":"Love it, I visit every time I come to town. Excellent margaritas and decent food. Reasonably priced and great happy hour specials! Solid 4-star!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best tacos at the best price possible especially on tuesdays. Margaritas are my jam here as well. Their watermelon margarita is my fav because they use fresh watermelon juice compared to other places that uses watermelon flavored sugar syrup. The manager Jami came by and checked on me which was awesome because that shows the people who run this place care about their customers. Love it here."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals, great margaritas, great service. Definitely could become my favorite."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate a decent lunch here. Although, it wasn't the best or even second best taco place I've been too. Taco Tuesdays only refer to one taco on the menu, that being shredded beef. We ordered four shredded beef tacos, two fish tacos.   Tip: you may order soft corn tortilla tacos instead of the hardshell for the shredded beef. I preferred the fish taco over all the dishes I tried. In the end, I just picked out the meat and veggies and did not eat the rest of the soggy tortilla.   We also ordered the house margarita. It was very satisfying! As it was a hot day, it did quench the thirst. Other than that, I'd say I would only come back for happy hour or if everything off the menu was half priced"}
{"text":"Decent meal. Probably will not be back, the queso definitely has Velveeta in it, I don't care what they tell you. (We did not ask). It was tasty, but that was the Velveeta. Tacos and chimichangas we're good, margaritas were OK, with a visit if you're hungry, but not one to wait for. We were hungry and wanted to eat now and we got what we paid for and what we were looking for. Really lovely service."}
{"text":"Really delicious and fun place! I came with my family (group of 8) and it was so crowded so I'm glad I made a reservation. It had a fun party vibe, but still great for dinner!"}
{"text":"My first response to parking in front of Cien Agaves was \"what in the hell am I doing in tourist land?\" Old Town is such a piece of shit. Unless you like fake western hokey crap stores and indian flute music, you'll want to barf. Of course, when you walk into Cien Agaves, you're transported to a different type of atmosphere instantaneously.   They score with Moises' art on the walls, with the industrial looking staircase in the middle of the restaurant, and the generally good soundtrack. There are parts of the restaurant that feel like the divey little places you'd find in Guadalupe, and other parts feel like a Tempe college kid bar. None of it, however, feels like a nice restaurant. The diamond plating in the restrooms is oddly reminiscent of a shotty strip club.   The food here was about what I would expect. Not as good as The Mission, Barrio Cafe, Los Sombreros, etc. But much more interesting than a place like Los Olivos. They offer about a dozen different tacos with all sorts of seafood, meat, and bird. Service on my visit was a little slow. We waited about 15 minutes for our check and finally asked for it. Who knows how long we would have waited otherwise.   My main observation while here was the crowd. Even though the restaurant feels like the divey Tempe college kid restaurant, the crowd it draws is a little different. There were quite a few roided up douchebags with spider web tattoos, affliction shirts, and stupid gay shit eating grins with some fake tittied blonde with a nosejob hanging on them. It kind of seemed like a bar for Scottsdale douchebags when they want to \"slum it\" and have \"mexican\" food.  I'll probably go back eventually, but if you're looking for a place to have good Mexican food, skip Cien Agaves. If you want to sip a few Coronas and have some tacos and salsa, you'll be happy as a clam here."}
{"text":"Glad to say this place is still going strong a little over a year after my first visit/review. Wanna try it? Then visit on a Tuesday night for $1 tacos and $2 cervezas! They have amazingly good Tacos and Salsa, and an excellent Tequila bar. Do try the grilled corn on the cob.  Excellent place to hang all night with friends - great drinks, great food, great prices."}
{"text":"Extremely rude manager. I can't believe how she handled a particular situation. I enjoyed the food and the drinks but did not enjoy the atmosphere. If there is an issue approach it in an appropriate way. I can't say I'll be back."}
{"text":"Holy Tequila!  Luv the margaritas here!  House margaritas are the best.  I highly recommend the Cucumber margarita!  Its cool and refreshing with the perfect amount of tequila.  Great drink for the hot AZ summer!  Tinga tacos are my absolutely favorite.  Great crunchy chicken taco!  Great place in OT for some awesome food and drinks.  This is one of the best happy hour locations in town!"}
{"text":"Very nice place! Loved the outdoor fire pit seating, our server Audra was adorable! Very attentive didn't forget a thing, loved the salmon tacos. Will be back"}
{"text":"Came to Cien Agaves as part of a group lunch recently. Since they market themselves as the best tacos + margs in AZ, I was super intrigued to try them out. Thank goodness for my friends who get us together to try all these new-to-us places in the Valley!   They're in a cute + festive building in Old Town that is definitely reminiscent of the Wild West. I give them props for that. I left wishing I could give them props to their food + margs... there was a lot desired from them. Perhaps another visit is in order? ::shrug::   The servers were super kind since they had our group to deal with. By the time I arrived mostly everyone had ordered so they went thru the menu, their suggestions with me. I went with the highly-recommended AZ Prickly Pear Marg. It's so pretty! But not that good. I didn't want to bother the servers so I just kind of sipped on it slowly until we left instead of ask for another. I went with a chicken fajita salad too. Really nice presentation in a full fried tortilla bowl, but there's nothing really worth the $13 for it as it's just a standard bland salad with chicken. I wasn't terribly impressed either with their chips and salsa. That's hard to come by for me... but they did."}
{"text":"Tequila tasting can we taste some tequila next time.. was a fun experience but the tequila wasn't even a half a shot"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for about 3 years and there is one thing that keeps bringing me back. The Tinga Taco.   The tinga is the single best taco I have ever had. Shredded marinated chicken thrown into a crispy shell then the whole thing deep fried. Throw in there fantastic chips and salsas and you got my favorite place to go in the valley for tacos."}
{"text":"5 stars for the margaritas alone!  The cucumber one is awesome!   I've only been there for food a few times and have been impressed every time. The salmon taco is pretty good.  For me, these are the best margaritas in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food was reasonably good but not good enough to prompt us to return. This restaurant's location make it a tourist eatery; we felt rushed through our meal. We ordered guac and chips and drinks to start, 5 mins later ordered dinner. The drinks & guac/chips (which were good) arrive 15 mins after we placed the order & our dinner (which was fair) arrived 2 mins after that. There was barely room on the table for the food, but what was more disappointing is we sensed the restaurant/server was more interested in quick table turnovers. She didn't even ask if we wanted dessert, but just brought out the bill. There are plenty of other Mex-themed restaurants in this city; the food here is not that special. This is not the place to chill and chat."}
{"text":"This place has a good vibe to it.  Their food is okay, nothing too special.  They do have specials during different days of the week.  I went on Tuesday for their shredded beef taco special for $1 a piece.  Like I said, nothing too great, but decent for what it's worth.  So when you go on a day they have a special be prepared to wait a few minutes.  For it being my first time there, I would have enjoyed it more if the waiter was a little more kind to the customers.  I'll give her the benefit of a doubt and say she was having a bad day."}
{"text":"We were seated upstairs which was extremely noisy. Could hardly carry a conversation. Food was good but we will only stay if we can sit outside."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food was great, staff was amazing, beergarita's are wonderful."}
{"text":"I love the decor, music and food. Its a casual spot with an amazing menu. I love the taco stand menu. The margaritas seem like there isn't any sweet and sour which is awesome because that syrup stuff makes my stomach hurt. The service is always attentive and prompt. I'd say the only area of improvement would be supplying guests with eating utensils. Nothing is worse that getting your food without something to eat it with. Its happened to me almost every time i go."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in here. Half price starters during happy hour. The burrito was a touch dry but nothing drenching it in salsa didn't fix. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We came here with the local recommendation of our hotel concierge. Good place to get tequila with delicious tacos, he said. We came during lunch on Saturday so no happy hour and no drinks to vouch for.   We ordered the Pollo Asada Burrito and Tres Tacos combo. The burrito was good, not spectacular in the marinade. They kinda went light on the cheese and guac, but the black beans were delicious. For the tacos- we ordered Lobster, Mahi mahi, and shrimp. The shrimp tacos were my favorite. Extremely flavorful, and cooked perfectly. This place can add a little more lobster to the taco, and the mahi mahi was okay.  The service was quick and all the ladies were very nice. Food was mediocre though."}
{"text":"Such an easy place to enjoy for a relaxing drink and/or food.  The staff is always friendly, the drinks are good and food is tasty.  Cool, mellow little vibe in there."}
{"text":"If you're in old town and in need of good Mexican food and great service. This should be your stop. Whether it's just for their great happy hour with their bartenders (make sure you say hello to Michael Ann, she makes a mean Margarita) or joining them for their great taco Tuesday, you can't go wrong. My favorite is their burrito and a nice cold Dos Equis.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and the customer service was excellent. Every time we go the food is amazing! They have a great happy hour and great bartenders! Their selection of seafood is impressive too!"}
{"text":"Hands down favorite Mexican Restaurant in Scottsdale. The margaritas are the best that I have ever had and are extremely reasonable during their long happy hour. The tacos and appetizers are delicious."}
{"text":"Came in to check this place out and did not disappoint. Started our with the tequila flight which was awesome and ordered the chicken fajitas which came out extra hot. Can even see the steam in the picture. Delicious!! Becky was awesome and gave us great service. Will definitely come back to get the margaritas I keep hearing about"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, margaritas, and guacamole. Very good serving sizes too. Service was good and food came really quickly."}
{"text":"Came here with some girlfriends, after walking around the Old Scottsdale and taking in the character and desert sights. In the heat, all I wanted was a tall cool drink, maybe with alcohol. Ended up getting a Cien Agaves margarita for myself, which was quite good. If my girlfreinds drank alcohol , i would have ordered a pitcher they call  El Gigante.  Food was just very bland for me, and very pricey (but it is smack in the middle of a tourist area, so no surprise). ($4.95 for ONE taco - it better be Kobe asada, or Kurobota carnitas and premium Ahi tuna). Maybe that's the Arizona style for Mexican food, but it was not my thing.  Three stars for our very sweet-faced server, it would have gone higher if maybe we got our food and water sooner. Kitchen seemed really slow."}
{"text":"I came in to Scottsdale for the first time this weekend visiting family and came to this area to have dinner and decided on this place after walking around the area. We could have gone anywhere..Came in and got seated by the host immediately who was very friendly. Looked at the menu as we wanted to check out everything so after a time of watching our waitress Nikki standing and socializing and talking with some guys we were ready to order and waited. Ok fine. Food was delicious, so that's good. shrimp tacos and Ono fish tacos were great.  So I notice that Nikki didn't give us chips and salsa or ever bring it to our table! When I see every other table have them! And the other waitress was offering it the table behind us! Um really? Why didn't we get them? It's just showing how you could give a crap to bother. So lazy! I was pretty irked by that, then another person brings our food to the table while Nikki is still gabbing away with her co workers. Ok. We wait for a long time to get our check, until Nikki says she is going to get our checks out to the table. Then I see Nikki Run out the door to her friends on the street saying \"I'm off!!!\" Um, I'm still sitting and waiting for our check over 15 mins later.. I got up after Nikki was talking away with her friends outside and completely forgets about us. Hello??? I went to the front and asked the hostess to get her and give us our checks so we can leave! Does Nikki not take her job seriously?! To top it off her attitude was so obvious and rude I cannot believe it. Nikki in a huff ran to the back to get our checks. Gave them to our table so fast then ran off again without taking my money even! I am sorry I even needed to break change because she gave me about 5 effing nickels instead of a quarter. Why?! Give me nickels cuz you're mad I asked you to do your damn job?!! Idiot.  The hostess told me our waitress \"mother was in town.\" Um what? She should have said I'm sorry I will get her right away! No Nikki you were not off work! and you should be fired for how you treated me and walking outside like we didn't exist! I wish we had the waitress behind us because she seemed very nice. If it's the end of your shift don't blame that on guests! Some people are not meant to be in the service industry and Nikki is one. Regret getting her as a waitress. And I want yelp to know. Fire her!!"}
{"text":"Ode to Taco Tuesday   Cien Agave, how I love thee  Where else can I go to get tacos for free!?  Well, technically they are not free, but still  Only $1 a piece, it's an absolute steal!   Your Tecate Light is so refreshing and crisp  And at only $2, I can have multiple sips!  If darker beer is more your fare,  Have a Modelo, it's not that much more!   The tequila you serve makes your Margs quite delish  All food so divine, I have only one wish!  Only one day a week is not enough, I say  Let's celebrate Taco Tuesday EVERY DAY!   TT fans - this little poem sums it up! If you want cheap food and drinks, good service, cool ambiance, and just an overall place to go, Cien Agave's on Tuesday nights is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This was our 1st Stop for dinner when we arrived in Scottsdale.  Taco Tuesday and Happy Hour!   We were not disappointed.  Tacos were delishous.  Drinks Outstanding. There is something on the menu that should please all who live Mexican food."}
{"text":"I ate here two days ago. Loved the guacamole. The appetizer options for happy hour were great"}
{"text":"Place is amazing!!! Get the potato tacos. Service is always great. Happy hour margaritas are reaaaallllllyyyy bomb"}
{"text":"Great find in Scottsdale. There's a lot of upscale restaurants in the area and Cien Agaves is more reasonably priced and they serve good quality Mexican. I'm pretty picky about Mexican food and really enjoyed the whole experience here. We stopped in on Monday night when the house margarita was half off and tacos were 2.50. I got a margarita and two tacos for 9.00!  It's also located in old town Scottsdale which is a fun area to check out. If you are looking for a more casual, comfortable spot in Scottsdale, stop here."}
{"text":"Service mediocre.  Food arrived cold and wasn't tasty. Totally overpriced for Mexican."}
{"text":"Chimichangas with a few tiny shreds of Chicken, mostly 99.9% rice filled. Tacos had total of one teaspoon of beef in them. If your looking for meat filled food, don't go here...they use all fillers yet charge the prices of what you'd expect to get in good quality food. Don't waste your hard earned money at this place."}
{"text":"The out-of-town family wanted Mexican, so we took them here. Since I don't eat meat, I'm not a fan of most Mexican restaurants because there is a limited selection for me. Here, the waitress recommended the shrimp and veggie tacos--both were great. And, I could even eat the refried beans (because there was no lard in it)! We all got Cadillac Margaritas and everybody was very pleased with their food. I also appreciated that they were so diligent about the reservation, a party of 8. They gave us a table upstairs that was private and spacious. For someone who doesn't typically consider getting Mexican food, it says a lot that I'm looking forward to going back here in the near future."}
{"text":"HOLY HABENERO LIME MARGARITA.     So I decided to man up and try this thing out after thinking about it many of times.  It was just as I expected hot and amazing.  After I was almost done though I was finishing my last sips when it happened.  I got a seed right into the back of my throat that was the painful moment that kept me away from ordering this thing before.  I managed to pull through though and finished it.    I also got the 3 taco meal and the tacos were great I had tinga, lobster, and chorizo and papas.  The beans were horrible but the rice was ok so just order the tacos without sides and save yourself a bit of money."}
{"text":"So good! The carne asada taco was amazing, shrimp Diablo taco was very good and the shredded beef taco was good but a little dry (needed more sauce). The habanero margarita was really good and not very spicy but the star of the meal was the churro sundae! SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The patio is excellent seating. The three taco deal is a good deal for $13.50. I told the server (Caitlin) to bring  me her three favorite tacos and she chose excellently. I had the Carnitas -- smoky and spicy, Island shrimp -- sweet and sour, and  a breaded fish taco that was excellent.the house margarita is good but they have a huge selection of margaritas and tequila. Excellent grub and value. Do it!"}
{"text":"Thank you Cien Agave for celebrating teachers last night with your #redforedaz event. You are the first in our community to reach out for support. The service and food was excellent as always!  @Azedunited"}
{"text":"Are we getting a few more visitors this year, or are my poor old ears deceiving me?   I think we are getting more visitors, based on the accents I'm hearing and the number of people clogging the entrance to my little lunch spots...reading the menus...gawking around...discussing all of their personal peccadillo's and preferences...\"I dinna wanna fookin taco...I wanna go ta the fookin Breakfast Club\" :-)  I think they were Scottish tourists, if I'm any judge of kilt's:)...and maybe soccer hooligans, too...although no soccer is being played in Scottsdale right now...spring training hooligans? :-)  I heard all that and more on Taco Tusday at CV, yesterday...an \"elderly\" lady from Baahstaahn (probably this side of 100, but well north of 90) complaining in a loud voice that the beef tacos were \"tooo hawt...spaahcy hawt!\"...imagine that...spicy food at a mexican joint:)  After detoxing with a pleasant little 6 miler along the mighty Scottsdale River, my buddy and I decided that we needed a little retox at Cien Agaves to put a spring back in our steps...I had 3 of the darling little $1.00 shredded beef tacos...my buddy had 11...that's right...11...at a sitting...for lunch:-)  He's 30 years younger than I am and he's a professional athlete... I remember the days before my MC4R gene started misbehaving and I could eat like that...damn genetics! :-)  If I did that kind of thing these days, you would need to chain saw out the wall of my home and use a crane to get me out of the house and onto set of \"Biggest Loser\":)  Yesterday was a nice day for a taco tuesday retox...great weather for the tourists...I heard a number of un-Scottsdale accents, dialects and languages on the street (as befits a tourist mecca like Old Town Scottsdale) and it looked like the turquoise and tee shirts were flying off the shelves so things are starting to pick up again:)  It's put me in such a good mood that I'm even willing to up my rating of CV to a solid 3.5 stars...although I still don't round up...sadly:)"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner and had an awesome experience!  The staff is super friendly and helpful and the food was great.  I had the tacos and my friend had the fajitas.  Everything was priced right and we will be back many more times.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I had while in Oldtown Scottsdale. They where open late on a Monday night where most of the area closes at 9pm and a couple at 10pm. Enjoyed the enchiladas and was a happy camper at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Yeah, I made it for Taco Tuesday!!! Wow, $1 beef taco's, my girlfriend and I put down 7 tacos with an appetizer. This place was great, very busy and a little loud, but we didn't have to yell at each other to have a conversation. The only bad part is our waitress was a little slow in getting us refill's and we asked for more salsa and didn't get it, but will definately be back for $1 beef taco's."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, tequila was too. We stayed for hours because the fire pit was so nice. If you're lucky enough to have Mel as your server you're in great hands!"}
{"text":"I brought a group of clients for a happy hour to Cien Agave after a day of training. We had a reservation and they were great at checking in with us earlier in the day to make sure we were planning on coming and if we had any special request. We got there 15 mins early and BOOM, our table was ready! This gave them the 2 stars.  Unfortunately the food was the downfall. We all had tacos and they came out incredibly dry and flavorless, I am assuming they were left under a heat lamp a little too long. Probably the saving grace of our meal was the pork queso appetizer which was excellent. Maybe a couple extra margaritas before the food would of made it all taste better."}
{"text":"*Better than your typical Mexican Restaurant.  *The service was fantastic.  *Best happy hour *Try the house made margarita *Great for groups or eating alone *Located in a cute area that's great for walking"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, never disappointed. We did have a large group and it was a little slow getting more food but otherwise good."}
{"text":"This is a solid option for Mexican food and some drinks. Good atmosphere but it's kinda on par with Chevys...it is not the best Mexican or authentic but it was definitely good.   Chicken fajitas was tasty paired with a shot of patron and some tecate...bottom line: I'd come back next time im in town for spring training since it's right next to the giants Scottsdale stadium!"}
{"text":"Great place and accommodating for kids. The prickly pear margarita was a hit with my wife!"}
{"text":"Maybe we came on an off night.  I heard the Taco Tuesdays here were really fun and crowded.  But we came to a half emtpy restaurant and a cranky server.  The food was decent.  We had the shredded beef tacos ($1.50 each) and the complimentary chips and salsa.  Three tacos was enough for me, but I probably could have had a fourth.  Overall the facility is clean and nice, with big TVs all over.  However, it is a smaller buildilng which makes it feel somewhat cramped in here.  Maybe I will try again another time."}
{"text":"Went here with some out of town friends and liked it very much. We made it for happy hour, before 7pm, so the apps were half off. We got the guacamole and ceviche, which were probably the best part of the meal! Btw, Thanks to the yelper who told us we have to REQUEST the free salsa and chips that come with the meal, otherwise, we would never have gotten them! I ordered 2 chicken tinga $2 tacos and one grilled Ono taco. I really liked the Ono, but the tinga was just ok. My friends ordered the spicy shrimp taco and liked it. I would definitely come back another time, but make sure it was for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place five stars but due to the strange encounter with the host and hostess I can't. When four of us arrived at 4:30pm the hostess told us there was a 15-20 minute wait as we stood in an empty restaurant. They told us the kitchen was backed up and they couldn't seat any more people. We were fine with that and just wanted to sit down and enjoy a couple drinks. After some back and fourth one of them reluctantly took us to the island just past the bar threw down our menus and left. We could hear them griping about the situation from our table. It was just such a strange and awkward encounter I had a hard time enjoying my meal. After this however we had great service from our server and the food was delicious and incredibly fast considering the kitchen was backed up when we walked in. My favorite from the meal was the guacamole with pomegranate seeds on top. I would love to give this place another try in the future."}
{"text":"So this is becoming one my favorite spots for Happy Hour. The tacos are delicious as well as the Margaritas. My friend brought me here to try it out one tuesday when the tacos are $1 and now it is our place to meet up!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday, half off appetizers and Cien Agave Margarita. Food was really good. The hostesses were not very friendly or helpful but once we got to a table it was worth the hassle. Tingas tacos, beef tacos, tostada and guacamole. YUM!!"}
{"text":"-1 for the handful of gnats hovering above our table  -1 for the dingy smell inside the restaurant -1 for the dirty cloth napkins -2 for the awful tasting tacos (\"lobster\" and chorizo con pappas)*  -1 for the practically virgin banana colada  * lobster is in quotes because i highly doubt it was real lobster. it tasted more like what imitation krab is to real crab. oddly crunchy, chewy and trasparent.   i would've left if i were on my own, but i was with two friends that wanted to try it out and we had a groupon. personally, i never plan on setting foot in this place again. i want to gag just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We sat outside in the little alley way which was super cute! The food was good. Our waitress was sweet but she kept forgetting about us. We had to ask other servers to help us a few times:("}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour.  Fresh ingredients cheap drinks and the best service ever today. Thanks! Happy hour till 7 not 6 like most places. Even on weekends not just Mon thru Fri."}
{"text":"A fine enough Mexican restaurant. Pamplona soup was very good, somewhat spicy. We shared the chicken fajitas. Plenty of food for two at a good price. But charge me $1-2 more and have some sour cream and guacamole on the side! Chicken had no real flavor. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We recently had a casual wedding rehearsal dinner here for 50 people. From the Manager to the entire wait staff we were thrilled with the customer service. Our guests all complimented the food & we enjoyed having the upstairs area all to ourselves. Our new son in law goes here regularly for taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Love that this restaurant supports local schools! Thanks for hosting a fundraiser for RedforEd!"}
{"text":"Really good small plate Mexican place. The tequila and margaritas are on-point! The selections available very numerous and of the couple I have sampled are delicious. Taco selection is decent and the results are very flavorful and satisfying. I will be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Travelzoo voucher - what a find!!!!! The beer batter fish taco was great!!! Enoyed the Chicken Fajitas, the taco combo plates. Looking forward to going back, will get my own beer batter fish taco next time and not split it with my boyfriend :-)  The waitress told me they have good specials all week.  Only complaint was the rice was dry."}
{"text":"Outstanding taco's and tequila here!  They have over 100 brands of tequila and some of the best taco's I've had in a long long time.  I kind of expected it to be good, but not amazing, but I was wrong.  The food was way better than I expected.    I tried 3 different taco's from the 13 they offered, and all 3 were incredibly good.  The free chips and salsa were very good.  They had 2 different salsa's as well, the red was very good, but the green salsa was just incredible.  The bartender said the red just recently won a \"Best Salsa in Phoenix\" award from someone, but I was way more impressed with the green salsa (which I almost didnt try, as just by looking at it, you wouldnt think it would be good).  Pretty friendly environment inside and great staff.    I went for lunch, but it seems like it would get pretty busy for the bar crowd after dinner on the weekends, especially being right next to Patty's 1st Avenue Lounge.  Definitely a cool hangout, and a little nicer on the inside than I expected at least in terms of the tables, but then the booths and the bar seemed like more chill areas and more casual for sure.    I hope this place makes it and stays a long time.  They could use another TV or two in the bar area (at least downstairs), but thats hardly a complaint.  I was very impressed overall.  Definitely worth your time to go check out."}
{"text":"Lots to like at this spot.  Tacos can be good but unimpressive but this is a better result than most.   The fish tacos are flavored with a nice amount of kick.  I am a fan.  The atmosphere is chill and fun.  This is our second visit and we now look at it as a go to spot"}
{"text":"Bad Americanized Mexican Food: 0 stars  Reeks of dismal chain restaurant.  Paying for the check now...couldn't wait to tell the Yelpers to stay away.  Food: 0-stars. The burrito I ordered came out with everything on the side, i.e. guacamole, beans, cheese. Only thing inside was rice and meat. Yet burrito was closed.   What??? So then it's a fajita right? The rest of my group shared other complaints.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Two words. Taco Tuesdays. Big night for the carnivores. And even though I'm now a vegetarian, I can still appreciate the beauty (from afar) of a $1 shredded beef taco. And did I mention the $2 Tecates and Dos Equis and $4 house margaritas all night? If your regular happy hour spot is packed, I'd recommend visiting Cien Agaves.   And apparently, each night is devoted to a different taco, with specials all week long. With an entire page of delicious taco options (including some yummy veggie-friendly options), this is your one-stop taco shop.   The chips and salsa are also tasty and plentiful. They bring you both the chunky, mild red salsa, and a slightly spicier tomatillo version. And the chips are reminiscent of those served at Aunt Chiladas, fluffy and delicious!"}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday evening with family around 7:15 pm.  We had a fairly large group (about 25 people).    Cool atmosphere and the server was nice, however the service was very SLOW.  I had to ask 3-4 times for water before I received it.  It would have helped it there were more servers assigned to our group.  The food was decent. I liked the chips and salsa. For an entree I had a fish taco on a flour tortilla, it was fried fish (just ok).  I asked for extra sauce and that made it better.  I also had an ahi tuna taco on a flour tortilla, that was also good once I added the extra sauce.  My husband and I both ordered a house margarita, it was good.  I think the entire meal from start to finish ended up taking about 3 hours.  I really wanted to try the flan but since it took so long to get the meal, I was sleepy and ready to leave. Even getting our bill took longer than expected."}
{"text":"Swung by on a hot summer Saturday. I only got to see the downstairs, but it was nice and cool inside and the staff was really friendly. Great margarita. I got \"the local\" and it was delicious! Try it!!"}
{"text":"I had the Island Shrimp Taco and the Tecate Fish Taco which were both delicious but very spicy for my taste. These were served with beans (black or refried) and rice. A bit pricy for the quality  since beans and rice are also a standard. Had the tacos been less spicy, my opinion of the quality might have changed."}
{"text":"Outstanding happy hour and fantastic food.  This is a regular place for me and my husband, visiting 1-2 times a week.  The \"local\" margarita is by far my favorite, not too sweet!  The grilled Ono taco is also my favorite thing on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch one day as we were driving through town. Our server was a trainee and she was pretty good, just a little green so things were a bit slower.   We got typical enchiladas and burritos. Food was good, but nothing outstanding. Their salsas were tasty but they charged more for some of them which is kind of odd but whatever.   Overall nothing was bad but I would not come out of my way to go here again."}
{"text":"I dislike reviews that mention partial stars...until I have to write one that hits a gray area, so there I am with Cien Agaves. Guilty with indecision and admission that I have to clarify my selection with a more accurate rating of 2.5 stars. Really, I have had better. And it's also ok. For the price and location in Old Town, it's not too bad.  The food is just ok (that is...rounding up to \"just ok\"). The chips and salsa are pretty good with the cumin-strong tomatillo standing out over the red. The guac is also nice and a bit too addicting. The tacos are nothing to rave about, and actually I'm not likely to order them ever again, but I've enjoyed a salad or two with grilled fish. While most people rave about the happy hour, the food options are meat-centric so not much to choose from on those deals for a veg/fish eater. But at least the margaritas are cheap.  The atmosphere on a weekend night is pretty energetic and the margaritas have a nice, fresh (aka no mix) quality. Not much by way of beer selection though. For diners that aren't super picky about Mexican food and don't mind the grease, this is a solid option. If you're more akin to the taste of say Gallo Blanco, meet your unpicky friends here and stick with the booze with some chips and salsa to tide you over."}
{"text":"Great tacos, super selection of tequila and good service."}
{"text":"Best. Taco. Salad. In. Phoenix.  Seriously, that stuff is amazing. This is probably because they make all of their own salad dressings. I get 2 or 3 of them on the side with every salad and that works so well for me. I get to taste a range of amazing flavors, appreciate the talent of their chef, while moderating the amount of extra calories I'm eating.  Another plus? The steak on it is amazing. Lean, pink in the center and tender! I really have to give it to them for producing such an amazing salad. Puts everyone else in PHX to shame."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restaurant yet but I heard they support the RedforEd cause so I WILL be eating there soon. I've heard great things about this place so I'm looking forward to visiting and updating my review."}
{"text":"The food at Cien Agaves is really good.  I had the ceviche, which, despite containing shrimp as the only seafood, was really well seasoned; and I also had the ahi tuna tacos, which were delicious and filling.  However, I only gave 3 stars because the drinks were not that great.  I had a strawberry mojito and a mango margarita, and neither was memorable."}
{"text":"I know that lots of folks LOVE this place, and its tacos, but I just can't get there. My friends have raved about Taco Tuesdays, but the fact that the tacos are fried leaves me cold. I've tried multiple times to enjoy them, but I've had to give up. I guess your tastes just have to run in that direction..."}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently. It was good enough to go back a couple of days later. It's a pretty typical Mexican restaurant. It wasn't the best Mexican meal that I've had but it was a good value for the price paid. The service was very good and it was at a pretty busy time."}
{"text":"This was a really good place for Taco Tuesday!  The tacos were a good size and very tasty.  The atmosphere of this place is awesome.  Two stories with a bar and bathrooms on both levels.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm from the Southeast, so it's possible my standards for tacos and margs aren't as high as someone from the Southwest, but this place was awesome.  Husband and I stopped in for lunch, had the prickly pear and watermelon margaritas, queso, and tacos and an enchilada.  Everything was amazing...margaritas were perfectly mixed, fresh, not too strong or too sour.  Queso was excellent, as were the salsas, and my husband had a side of guac and said it was excellent as well.  Now the tacos...the shredded beef taco was maybe the best thing I've ever eaten.  I didn't even share a bite with my husband.  I think it ruined tacos for me forever.  Hubby had a couple of other tacos as well and loved both of them, I also had a cheese enchilada and it was very good...but overshadowed by the taco.  Very reasonably priced for the quality of the food.  Service was great as well, but we were there for an early lunch on a Friday and the restaurant was not busy at all.  Looking forward to coming back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"been here twice and probably won't go back, unless i only have margaritas. the food was great the first time and very sub-par the second, especially for the price of the tacos. the pork ones were especially gross; extremely greasy and fatty and tasteless (i know pork is fatty, but it shouldn't be hard to chew).   our service was good the first go round, as we sat at the bar and learned a lot from the bartender about their tequilas. the second time, service was no good. very slow and our waters went empty for entire meal, even after we asked for more.   they do have great guac and chips and their margaritas are fantastic, and they should be for what you pay. but if you are looking for great tacos, skip this place. you'll be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in this restaurant but I think the food is pretty bland.  I've been here twice, I tried the big ass burrito with chicken and the carne asada tacos, I've had better though.  I do like their margaritas though especially the happy hour $3.50 margarita, you get the bang for your buck with the drinks."}
{"text":"Very, very good Mexican food! The good first...! Their specialty is tacos & they have all sorts to choose from. Best shredded beef taco I've ever had. The papas & chorizo taco was tasty too. I didn't care for the Diablo shrimp taco (which is odd because I LOVE guajillo chiles) but my husband thought it was great...to each their own! Fabulous & flavorful black beans.  The bad next...! I have never waited so long for chips & salsa at a Mexican restaurant ever in my life. In fact, I thought maybe we needed to order them but our waitress assured me they'd be right out. Ten minutes later we had to ask another waitress, who brought them out right away. Then we waited even longer for our appetizer guacamole. It was a little too tangy and topped with pomegranate seeds...just okay. Neither of my kids liked the food here. Both thought the Tinga chicken rolled tacos were too spicy. (I didn't think so.) They don't have any gringo items on the menu for kids or other picky eaters (& no ketchup). Of course, if everyone in your party digs Mexican food, this isn't a problem. We ordered 2 flour tortillas for the kids since they didn't eat any of their food. Then we had to wait 20 minutes for the tortillas to be delivered, but the waitress took them off the check due to the long wait. I don't know why she couldn't just call out the order instead of waiting for them behind big meal tickets, though. (I used to wait tables at a Mexican restaurant years ago.)  My husband and I will definitely be back. We'll just leave the kids at home next time!"}
{"text":"Im no longer a big fan of getting Mexican food since my mom makes the best, and every restaurant is just second best to her. I found this place and made reservations online, since one sister wanted Mexican and the other sister that came along loves tequila I figured it was already a homerun.   Walking in its a very cool little joint. Very colorful and vibrant which I liked, and super clean. We got seated right away and I ordered a Guacamole and our drinks to get us going while we figured out what we wanted. They brought out salsa and the guacamole and chips. I love Salsas and as long as you don't try to get too nuts you can make some of the best just with a few ingredients. Unfortunately, these 2 salsa mild and hot were neither hot nor good... They were very sweet and yugh! The Guacamole was very bland. I feel like they just mashed Avocado with some pomegranate drizzled on top, it needed some lime, cilantro, some salt.. You know the basics!   We got our tacos and yes!!! They were actually pretty damn good. I got 2 shredded beef and 2 carne asad and they were delightful. We asked if they had some salsa in the back that was HOT (which most Mexican restaurants do). They did bring some out and with the chips it was pretty weird tasting, but inside the tacos it was delish! It was super spicy just like I love it.   Last thing that surprised me was the Bill... I have never been charged for salsa... Like ever....... This place charges $1.50 for a small cup of Hot Hot salsa, and we had 2 of them. Its not that I cannot afford 3 dollars its just seriously.... $1.50 Each Salsa!!! I was just surprised by this. I would have gotten it anyway if they would have told me up front its just more that I have never been asked to pay for the chip salsa.... At least it made out Tacos complete."}
{"text":"Ok tacos and margaritas.  Nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, unique and tasty margaritas, great casual and energetic vibe. Our server, Dominique was fantastic.  (Try the beets bowl - so good.) check this out for moderately priced delicious food!"}
{"text":"Look, coming from the east coast I was never huge into Mexican food.  But let's just get real here....this place is THE BOMB.COM!  It's a tiny little spot tucked away in Old Town in a strip mall so it's pretty random.    From the moment that Cucumber Marg touched my lips...it was over.  Right now they also have the Cantaloupe Marg that is new for the summer and it is also glorious.  I mean, the only one I haven't liked was jalapeno and that's only because I don't like a hot kick to my beverages, I like them to refresh me not kick me! ;)  They also have the tequila challenge which I have yet to begin, but one day I will start !  You can get on the plaque as well as a t-shirt.  Legend says, if you go one step further you get happy hour (or half price, I can't remember) drinks for life!    Their street tacos are also D'LISH!  My favorite is the Tinga, shredded yummy chicken with their sauce and cabbage! Amaze.  I have tried the majority of them and have not been dissapointed.   When it's nice out the patio is cute and quaint, not a bad spot to post up having some margs.  Otherwise, the vibe inside is also pretty great.  Bright and vibrant plus you can actually see the crowd rather than the alley outside where it's a bit more intimate.   Overall, this place is BOMB - TRY IT !"}
{"text":"This was only our second time visiting as we come from Vancouver Canada but yet again it was AMAZING!  This time hubby had the chimichanga and I chose the 3 tacos with rice and beans. I had a super hard time deciding on which 3 to choose as they all sounded better than the last. I finally decided on a carne asada, pollo asado, and the tecate fish taco. The fish was by far my fave with the carne asada a close second. The waitress was friendly, attentive and helpful in giving me the low down on the tacos. Next time I will order al la carte since there was waaaaay too much food for me to eat.  When we are staying in Scottsdale in a few days we will returning to have the churro sundae since there was no room to eat it this time!"}
{"text":"Decent but not great...The shrimp on my Diabla Shrimp taco were cold, but decent flavor. Tinga Taco just OK.  Guacamole was pretty good...but portion should have been larger given price. Rice side dish was pretty bland...and my kids mentioned this too (ok, being from San Diego maybe I'm a little spoiled with some great Mexican food). There is probably better for the money."}
{"text":"Huge selection of tacos.  Carne asada, pollo asada and carnitas tacos all great. Ahi tacos we're huge with fresh seared ahi.  Loved my cucumber mint margarita...super refreshing on a hot night.  My son was disappointed in his Big Ass Burrito with green sauce...said it was average.  Go here for the tacos!  By the way, if you like really spicy salsa with your chips, you need to ask for it."}
{"text":"When you go to a place that's named Cien Agaves Tacos & Tequila, you expect your food to take like Mexican food, right?  Not the case here.  I ordered the Lean Green Machine (made vegan by excluding the yogurt) and, aside from it not tasting like Mexican food, the dish was executed poorly. Everyone at the table oohed and aahed at how pretty my dish looked, and commented on how it looked like it must have tasted so good...but was boring. Even more boring was the small amount of alcohol they put in their margaritas.  Come on guys, I can only fit so much in my stomach, I don't want to drink 10 margaritas in order to get a tiny buzz.  Meh overall!"}
{"text":"First time visitor to the restaurant.  Made the reservation thru open table.  Seated quickly, place was VERY busy because of the Golf tournament.   Staff was great, service was good, food was fine.  Cien Beet Bowl, was AMAZING.  Enjoyed the experience.  However, do NOT allow them to seat you on the second level.  VERY VERY LOUD because of low ceiling and poor acoustics.  Take the first floor or patio but don't sit upstairs."}
{"text":"the service what horrible. Come on. That is part of the reason we go out to eat. Bad experience. The Food less than expected.  Im not saying this to hurt the business but to help them understand this is not how you treat customers. Food - salsa was watered down. The food was just ok."}
{"text":"If you're in a touristy old town, you can' be surprised by a tourist trap.  Margaritas were strong, but food was overpriced."}
{"text":"This aint' the Ritz, but it is a cool place to grab grub after a Spring Training Giants game.   My son and I had nachos (high quality, btw) and beer after a game.  Perfect.  We'll be  back next year.  Go Giants!"}
{"text":"Casey is an awesome bartender/server. Best burrito I ever had. A must stop place when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  We had the guacamole with the pomegranate on top. We sat outside to get some sun in before our flight back east."}
{"text":"Stopped by for late lunch on the way to a conference. Excellent tacos. Tinga chicken was my favorite. Waitstaff was awesome. I commented to my colleague that it's the only time I can remember the waitress taking my order and not writing anything down and getting it 100% correct."}
{"text":"Came here to try something new. Maybe we should have stuck to our favorites. The water they serve here tastes like it came out of a garden hose, no amount of lemon could save it. After ordering drinks, we waiting what seemed to be a lifetime for the waitress to come back to ask questions about the menu and order. My bf ordered the shrimps tacos but got fish tacos. He ate what he continued to eat them because the waitress never came back to check on the food. He thought they were the worst tacos he had ever had. He did not finish them. Something had got to be pretty bad for him to leave food on his plate. The only time I would ever come back here would be for happy hour but even then probably not."}
{"text":"Taken to Cien Agave for a belated birthday celebration. Wanted to go here as they have Happy Hour EVERYDAY from 3-7. Headed over on a Sunday that was mildly busy. The group enjoyed house margaritas, cheese crisps, tacos ... All on the happy hour menu... And a chicken chimi that wasn't on the HH menu. Service was a little slow at times but once we brought it to our server's (Mila) attention, things improved. Server spilled salsa on the table...and us, but she recovered nicely. I would come back and would recommend this place.  Written by Knife of Knife N Fork/Fork N Knife. Be sure to check out the reviews of my critic in crime, Fork."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican influenced bar with tacos. A little run down, but casual and down to earth. It has a rustic feel to it, and offered lots of seating. The ridiculous amount of tequila offered at the bar definitely draws in customers. Quite a sight to see! The food was mediocre, tacos and burrito were OK, nothing special. The rice tasted a little burnt and the black beans were the best part. Though the shrimp were cooked to perfection, they got it right!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a spring training game, and was happy to see I made it in time for happy hour!  $3.50 house margarita, and it was tasty :)  We were sat right away and after drinks were brought chips and salsa.  The salsa was amazing!!!  It was so good, my whole family liked it, we polished off the basket in no time.  I ordered the chicken fajita bowl, it was really good and inexpensive, only $9.  The rice especially was delish, authentic with a bit of kick.  The kids burritos were a good size for the price and milk for them was only $1.  All and all a great stop for dinner.  Kid friendly but still adult and fun atmosphere, good food and good service.  They also had TVs everywhere, so we were able to watch basketball.  Great location and in an easy to walk area. For our family, it was a good choice!  Enjoy!"}
