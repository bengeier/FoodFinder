{"text":"Nice place! Very friendly.  Warm atmosphere. The beet salad was so good. I had the eggplant- loved it! My husband has the fish and chips and he said it was delicious!  Not overly priced either! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8. We were the only people here for the most part. At some point 2 other people sat.
 The food was not good. Every dish was overcooked. The \"special \" steak was awful. The salmon was so cooked and dry that we asked for lemons to wet it down. 
 The service was not good either. We were lacking in silverware and drinks the whole time. 
The ladies room had nothing to dry your hands with while every employee sat at the bar and chatted.


I will not be back for sure."}
{"text":"Really disappointing and has \"rules\" to impose their elitist esk, image crisis onto their customers.  Don't let the throw pillows and chandeliers fool you....this restaurant is not worth your time or money.  I am sure I am not alone when I say ... I miss Villa Francesca."}
{"text":"I went her with a group of girls on a Saturday night. I just wasn't impressed.

1) The music was WAY too loud. I get that having a live DJ is pretty cool and good for the atmosphere, but it was so loud I couldn't even hear my girlfriends talk and I def left with a headache.

2) The food was just ~alright. It wasn't bad and it wasn't awesome. I feel like there is definitely potential, but a lot of the items looked way better than they tasted. 

3) The service wasn't great. Our server was nice, but I don't think she was paying attention when I was ordering or perhaps the music was again too loud to understand. I had purposely asked if I could sub out the rice on the grilled chicken dish for something else and she said yes. I asked this because I did not want to pay extra and if it was then I didn't want it. When I got my check, however, I ended up having to pay for an extra side which I was trying to avoid in the first place. I didn't protest as I was just wanting to get out of there.

4)It took almost 40 minutes for even the appetizers to come out and almost an hour for our food. Most restaurants will wait until the whole parties food is done to deliver, but there was long periods of waiting in between the first person who got their food and the last. My girlfriend was among the first and had eaten almost all of her food before the last girl got hers. And on top of that, the last girl waiting on her food was told that they were out of the mashed potatoes and it would take 30 minutes to fix more. 30 minutes? And on top of the hour she had already waited? That's kind of ridiculous.


BUT, if you're wanting to just go for the hookah and drinks then you should be good."}
{"text":"Brought my husband here on a date on a random Monday night at 7:30. the place was PACKED and there was a DJ blaring club music. I'm not sure if it was some special event, but it wasn't exactly what we had in mind, especially after reading all the great reviews about the style of this new restaurant. We got appetizers that weren't above average and drinks. the cocktails were expensive but actually really good. service was amazing - the bar part of the experience. 

Just not what I was expecting, but maybe I'll give it another shot and stay for dinner if they turn the music down one night."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  Overdressed interior for the location however.. and we were the only people there for dinner on a Saturday night.  Literally, there was no one else there.  The food however was to die for - and the martinis were amazing.  I really can't say anything at all negative about this place, except for the absence of people.  Service, food, dessert, drinks - all spot on.  

Once word gets out about this place and the wait times are long, I'm sure I will long for the days when we were the only lone souls in the building!"}
{"text":"This neighborhood needs something more casual. My overall impression was \"trying too hard.\"
The food was fair, service okay (we were the only ones in the restaurant on a Wednesday night when they had first opened and it was just kind of awkward). Walking distance from my place but I don't plan on going back.  Too expensive to be a takeout option for me. Really miss Villa Francesca's."}
{"text":"My wife disagrees with the two star rating thinking it should only get one.  My thinking is: 1 for good service and one for cleanliness.  Even though the vibe (decor and music) is mid-nineties, it's well done.  The positive remarks end there unfortunately.  We ordered the Mediterranean Board for an appetizer and split the burger.  The fries (although greasy) and the hummus wasn't bad, but the taziki, chicken and beef skewers lacked any sort of Mediterranean flavor whatsoever.  They must have been out of salt and lemon because I've never had anything so bland before.  The meat was overdone, charred and had too much gristle.  No where near restaurant quality in my humble opinion.  The burger was sloppy and barely edible.  Bad meat? I'm not sure, but we both had stomachaches after the meal.  I feel bad giving them such a bad review, but their chef needs to figure out how to actually cook, not just create a cool menu.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Went here with a small group for Charlotte's Restaurant Week ... definitely not impressed. The appetizers (croquettes & calamari) were the best part. The pasta was just your average run-of-the-mill food. I ordered the carbonara pasta that said was to come with prosciutto. I expected the traditional thinly sliced prosciutto that you always get ... this was just chunks of ham!  And the portion wasn't even that large to boot ... definitely not worth $16.

I will not be returning... I thought the restaurant that used to be here, Villa Francesca, was much better."}
{"text":"I planned my husband's birthday for a large group (20). The staff was very helpful during the event planning. They were a little behind schedule having our tables ready but we were able to socialize and have drinks at the bar. The food was very good, although the staff had some issues with serving. When it came time to pay, some people never received checks, others were overcharged and one credit card never made it back to the owner. We all seemed to like it until it was time to leave. We spent more than an hour just trying to pay 
and leave. So I would recommend having everyone on one check and pay in cash."}
{"text":"The short ribs are wonderful. I've had them twice. So tender you don't need a fork and the demi is a great compliment to the rich meat. I am picky about my short ribs and I will order them on my 3rd visit! My husband has had the cast iron skillet strip and loved it. Perfectly cooked and the wilted spinach was a good match. For $23, this is a great deal. You will be hard pressed to find a steak this good for that price!"}
{"text":"just had a slice of pizza . it was fine , with a water togo , the water cup had 3 fruit flies in it"}
{"text":"This place use to be a little italian joint with pretty damn good pizza.  Now it is your typical new american eatery.  

Damn if wasn't craving a burger and looked out the window to see this place.   Awesome.  

So I cant speak to anything but the FFs burger and coke.    But mmhmm good!   

It seems everybody is putting their own flair on a burger these days.   This one had the red onion jam.   RED ONION JAM WTF?   Ok sign me up.  Anything with jam as an ingredient is a must try. Right?    But hold the kale. Im not a kale person.   Arugula instead please.   

No complaints.  Good stuff.   Heres the kicker.  Im a mustard person.  Part Polish, so mustard and sausage is my thing.    

Here, they have legit course ground brown mustard.   So thats pretty huge in my book.    

Check em out if your in the area. If you are really smart you would eat here before going to an event at the arena and just leave your car here.   Atleast, I would. I mean, good food before event, drinks after with dessert and you parked the car for free.  Duh. That a no brainer in this guys opinion.

Update.   Grand opening is in two weeks sooo...  Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for restaurant week and we had a great experience. One of the owners greeted us upon arrival and took us straight to our table. Our server was pretty good, best part was she let us try the wine prior to purchasing a bottle. We each got different things to eat so we could each try them. We had the caprese salad, calamari and the cordon bleu croquettes for apps. Each of those were so delicious!!  For our main courses we got the chicken, salmon and the beef and risotto. The chicken and risotto were nothing short of amazing but the salmon was lacking flavor. It was cooked well but just lacked flavor. For dessert we had the chocolate mousse and the cookie platter and both were outstanding! The manager came over and apologized for the mishap with salmon and definitely over compensated for it. Unfortunately I don't remember her name but she was wonderful! I will definitely return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"After months of walking past this restaurant in our neighborhood, my husband and I tried to actually stop in last week. It was dark. Think it's closed."}
{"text":"Probably my mistake was ordering from these guys via Foodie Call without ever having been to the restaurant. Sadly I was not very happy with what I got. I started off with a beet salad that involved tzatziki sauce. The salad was fresh and good, and turned out to be huge enough to be dinner, which was fortunate. The other thing I ordered was the risotto with beef tips. How can you go wrong with risotto, right? Well, I was suspicious when my order went to \"enroute\" on Foodie Call lightning quick -- how do you get a good risotto in that short a time? Answer is you don't. It was awful. Soggy, bland, and, at the same time, totally overpowered by raw garlic, and (maybe I am a picky eater and this is a style thing? but whatever, it's a style I don't like) pieces of very undercooked onion and garlic and gobs of barely melted cheese scattered throughout my supposed-to-be creamy and comforting risotto. Ultimately I ended up picking the steak cubes (which were fine) off my risotto, putting them in the salad, and tossing the risotto. Not cool."}
{"text":"Thinking I'd have a nice Italian dinner from Villa Francesca, I was surprised to see the new @7th Restaurant. I decided to give it a try. I sat at the bar to have a glass of wine and take out. Since it was New Year's Eve, they offered a good-ol' traditional special of  pork belly, collard greens and black eyed peas. The pork belly was probably the best I've ever had. It had a sweet-salty crust and was rich and tender. Decadent! The collards had good flavor but I did detect a wee bit of grit. The black eyed peas were just slightly under cooked. I don't like mushy but would rather not have too crunchy.
The service at the bar was very good.
Basically, I will definitely go back to @7th. They have a really nice decor, great location and a good thing going. They should be able to do well."}
{"text":"I don't know if they are still figuring things out because they are new, but the food was some of the blandest I've ever tasted. No flavor, no unique items."}
{"text":"This is my second time reviewing this location. I wrote a review for the old restaurant that used to be here . I found this place by following a food blog on Instagram. I didn't realize the address so I made a reservation using open table . When I arrived there was just maybe two other parties. My friend and I tried the  Cordon Bleu Croquettes and they were alright . I expected a little bit more based off the description but were a nice small plate to start with. I had the Beef Tip Risotto as an entrée. This was really good and the portion was pretty nice for the price. I also tried a whiskey mixed drink which was STRONG.. so I would recommend the bar 
Overall the service was nice and I love the transformation from the previous restaurant that was there. The décor is very modern and inviting. I would come back to try more off of the menu. 
My only gripe which was an issue with the other place is parking. There is like nowhere to park at this place.  There are maybe 8 spaces in the back and a few in the front.  We came the same night of a Hornets and game and luckily I was able to find a spot... I would prefer not to park on the street or in the expensive price gouging parking lot nearby."}
{"text":"I miss Villa Francesca.  I went to this new incarnation of it today for lunch hoping for some pasta, but pasta is no longer on the lunch menu.  My chicken parm sandwich was pretty good, but it was not pasta.   Maybe I will get pizza the next time.  Or just go to Mama Ricotta's instead.   

If you get the balsamic dressing on your salad, be aware that it splatters all over and stains your shirt if you are not ultra-careful.  

The place is not bad but it isn't Francesca's anymore.  Unfortunately."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Parmesan sandwich with a side salad.  Both were fantastic.  My husband enjoyed the Steak and Cheese (with shaved NY Strip).  We split a chocolate cookie plate with with cannolis cream on the side.  It was heavenly!!! MMMMM!  If you haven't been back since the change of management and name please go by and check them out!  The staff was super nice.  I will be a regular."}
{"text":"We got delivery from Foodie Call, so I can't speak for the atmosphere or service, but this was one of the best NYC-style pizzas I have had in or out of NYC. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my restaurant week experience here. Despite some confusion with our table, I'd rather focus on the food for now. I had the salmon which came with brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes, I really enjoyed because it's just a healthy dish that makes you feel good. I would prefer my fish a little less cooked, as salmon can dry out easily. I also started my meal with the Tuna which was very good! Very tender and flavorful. My friend started with calamari which was crispy and delicious, she followed her started with the sirloin. The steak was juicy, and had a good amount of fat. - She ordered med rare.

They finished the night with a chocolate mousse, which was decadent and rich!

I will be back again :D"}
{"text":"Great place.  If your in the area you must check it out.  New owners new menu great changes.  Great menu choices and very cool vibe great food great service. Make sure you meet Howie when you come in, he's the best...."}
