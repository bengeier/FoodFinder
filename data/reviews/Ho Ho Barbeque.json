{"text":"Took my wife to grab some pork here cuz everyone on Yelp was raving about it being the best on this side of town. Ended up trying a bit of everything. It was all cool but I feel like a bit more expensive than I expected.  I think the people talking about the pork being the best must be regulars, it's good don't get me wrong I just wasn't calling family members and telling them they need to try it. I drove far to try it, I won't again. If I'm nearby and feel for it i might try again"}
{"text":"Best roast pork I've ever tried. Skin is crispy even after being microwaved."}
{"text":"A ton of food! High quality Chinese BBQ (pork and duck). All for $6!  Would recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Got half a duck, 2lbs of roast pork, and 2 pieces of tofu. It cost us $30. The food is fresh and delicious and the service is amazing. They're super friendly and informative about different cuts of meat and even gave us huge samples to try. They're very generous with the sauce as well. 100% recommended. I signed up for yelp just to make this review I was so impressed.  We actually started our journey at Sam May BBQ at Midland and Sheppard. But after witnessing really terrible and rude customer service, decided to take our business elsewhere. Very glad we did to find our new favourite BBQ place!"}
{"text":"I like this place bc it's great eats for affordable price.  Plus the owner is really nice and speaks English.  Which other place I went to before lack of."}
{"text":"Never dry, never under seasoned, ALWAYS worth the bang for your buck.  5/5 food 5/5 service 2.5/5 atmosphere  Specifically take-out. I can't remember whether they have 2 stools near the front but you're better off bringing your meal over to the food court to enjoy. I can only comment on their cha-siu (bbq pork) and roasted pig but MAN are they good! So succulent and satisfying. They never skimp on the meats so your every bite of rice is coupled with a bit of meaty goodness and sauce (i always extra sauce my rice).  It's fairly cramped but luckily you don't have to wait for long. We've visited HOHO 3 times now and always the mid-aged cashier lady has been very pleasent, thoughtful and cheery. She has relatively good English communication skills but I found it easier to turn my Canto on.  A meal comes with choice of soup or drink, huge portion of rice, selection of veggie or tofu sides and awesomely tender meat(s) of your choice. All for under $8.  My favourite chinese BBQ joint by far!"}
{"text":"We arrived early and they still needed a few minutes to set up but the woman who ran the place was super nice. This is honestly one of the best services I've ever received from a restaurant. She made conversation with us and was super nice and generous with the servings. The food was also extremely good. The bbq pork was nice and juicy and really flavourful. It's true that their meat isn't as salty as other places but I personally like it that way. The serving was also pretty big and definitely worth it for such a cheap price. I am extremely satisfied with both the service and the food and will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"WOW! You wanna know how I discovered this place? I was in New York and picked up a an American magazine and it was ranking the best Chinese BBQ in North America and I kid you not that this place was in there as one of the best and for obvious reasons. They do EVERYTHING perfect. My wifey drives me up here after a night of hard partying and we grab some of the greasy crispy skinned pork. I get a whole duck and eat it at home with lettuce and she does the bbq pork pieces. All of it is so amazing and fresh. And the price....oh lawd don't let this cheap brown boy go on about the price. Best deal Scarcity/Markham and a really nice staff who are only too helpful to give you extra sauce and a few tips on how to enjoy. A def must!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. It is located in a Chinese Plaza in Scarborough.   HohoBBQ itself, is a hole-in-the-wall takeout joint. They specialize in Chinese style BBQ: roasted pork, BBQ pork, roasted duck, chinese sausage, and other dishes: curry, tripe, stewed  meat.  You can purchase meat with rice (entree), by the pound, or by the hog. I opted for the $7.35 2-meat combo plate. I chose the BBQ char siu pork,and roasted pork. The roasted pork was tasty, had crispy skin, and came in giant chunks. They were less generous with the Char Siu. The food comes piping hot with your choice of soup: bone broth with marrow, and other goodies, or cold soy milk. The lady advised me that the soup is INCREDIBLY hot and to be careful. I ate in my car, so I was extra careful not to burn myself. * Make sure you ask them to spoon you the soy sauce over the meat, and ask for the green sauce on the side. It seems like a garlic,ginger sauce. Really good, clean tasting, cuts through the grease of all the meat.  * Do not take your food to the food court next door. The janitor lady knew my food was from HoHoBBQ and literally kicked me out of the food court. On my sad walk to my car, I witnessed a hit and run with two vehicles. Be careful parking here, there is plenty of parking to the side of the buildin, facing the field.   I will return to HoHoBBQ. The man and woman running the joint are funny, kind, and generous."}
{"text":"Looks like this place has a new owner...I believe it was sold back in December.  Still serves large portions....the Roasted Pig is still decent."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars..  Decent food and really friendly owners. We got two rice boxes that came with two items. We got a bbq pork + roasted pork rice box and a bbq pork + soy sauce chicken rice box. We also had the option of veggies or tofu and we both went with tofu.I thought the bbq was on the drier side which was a bit disappointing since the reviews looked really promising. Chicken and roasted pork were average too. Good portion sizes though! My rice box lasted me two meals.   We paid around 15 dollars for the two rice boxes that came with soup also.   Might be hard to find if you're not familiar with the area, but it's the store farthest away from the foodcourt. Parking is also tough in the plaza."}
{"text":"Ho Ho BBQ is the King of Chinese BBQ.  Hands down, thee best place to get Chinese bbq. We've all tried Chinese bbq from food stalls, food courts, restaurants etc. But after experiencing Ho Ho BBQ, I can't look back.   What made me try Ho Ho BBQ were the rave reviews here on Yelp when in search of a good Chinese BBQ place and there's not a second of it I regret.  On a personal level, I grew up never eating pork so what's really got me hooked on Ho Ho BBQ personally is I don't get much of that 'porky' flavour (which ive been told is the flavour of the fat).   The hugggeeee plus for me though about Ho Ho BBQ is the consistency. I can come here on a Monday, a Saturday or a Thursday. The food will consistently taste the same. No change of flavour, no change in texture, it's always the same.   I haven't much to say about Ho Ho BBQ except, it's perfection."}
{"text":"We call him bald guy in Cantonese. I like it here it feels like Hong Kong. Apparently he steals all the business from the food court so if you buy from him you're not allowed in the food court. I usually get the tsa siu fan (BBQ pork rice) and siu yok which is pretty basic stuff to take home."}
{"text":"Hygiene: 1/5 Try to find the best time where the cutter isn't handling raw meat in the back, where he would run his hands under water for 2 seconds then proceed to cut your meat at the counter. Which is disgusting. Food: 5/5 Best crispiest roast pork, server ensures to drizzle sauce on the rice and not the pork to avoid making them soggy"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hole in the wall. In fact, I missed it twice and it wasn't until I actually walked inside the mall that I found the back of this restaurant, which gave me the hunch to walk along the front and read the signs more carefully. What's interesting is that there have been a lot of good reviews about this place, in a mall that has four Chinese BBQ restaurants. That's quite the accomplishment, so, I thought that I would try this restaurant today. I actually found this restaurant while I was looking for another BBQ restaurant but decided that I would try it. So, the restaurant is a hole in the wall, what remained to be seen is whether this restaurant is also a hole. Okay, definitely uncalled for, but I had to.  Here's what I noticed:  The restaurant is outside the food court of this mini mall, I don't actually know the name of the mall, so you are on your own. It is near the exit by the restaurant supply store, and almost seems like it is hidden behind the pillar. The sign is faded red and yellow and the yellow is starting to resemble an orange, which could be why I missed it. They have a scant seating area near the window but that didn't seem to be a problem as there wasn't much foot traffic while I was in the restaurant.   The kitchen is half the size of the restaurant and you can look in and see the cook doing everything. The BBQ meats on the display are inside the restaurant, so you would have to know that it was a BBQ restaurant to see its wares. The service was prompt, and the couple that were tending to me seemed like they were tag teaming very efficiently. She would take my order, then go into the kitchen and tell the \"butcher\"/cook what I wanted, he would then come out and chop what was needed, asking for my preferences of Chinese veggies or tofu. When he was done, he would go back into the kitchen and she would come out with my piping hot soup. She would bag everything for me and take my money.    The prices were low and the portions were plentiful. I didn't bother ordering a drink but then again, I didn't see a drink fridge, maybe I will look for it the next time.   The food was very good. However, let me be more specific. The presentation of my rice bowl was very well done. Of course, rice on the bottom, meat on either sides and vegetables in the middle. What surprised me is the ample portion of duck that I got. The rice was flavorful, the sauce was dead on. Vegetables were very simple, just a boiled in the middle of my rice bowl. The take out container that I refer to the rice bowl was large. The BBQ duck wasn't a leg, but it had a lot of meat and was very flavorful, so, I was satisfied with that. The Roasted Pork meat was also very plentiful and the skin was perfect, no blemishes and easy to eat. There was no sauce offered or given, which is sad, because everything has a perfect condiment. The soup was what I expected. If you don't like soup, there was no soya milk option like at Sun BBQ next door.   This restaurant is very reasonable, quick and close to what I would expect for a Chinese BBQ restaurant. I give it my seal of approval."}
{"text":"Incredible service at Ho Ho Bbq... Never experienced it in any place that sells pork bbq. Usually you get the typical straight faced service to get that pound of pork, you pay, you leave. The lady at the front was quite friendly and chatty... I usually thought Chinese speaking people get some sort of special treatment but she still asked if I wanted the lean or fatty roast pork, even gave me a bbq duck leg cuz she wanted me to taste it. Told me if I got in earlier, there would be better choices of cuts available, but she was totally sympathetic when I told her I was coming from work downtown.  Shared: - Roast pork and bbq pork, veggie n rice You can't go wron with pork! - Roast pork, bbq pork plus bbq duck leg I'm glad she gave me a piece to try, it was pretty good!  Too bad the place is a bit out of my way but I would reco to fam n friends in the area. Service alone is refreshing and worth a visit. The place is small, strictly take-away."}
{"text":"It's all about the duck!! Red sausage and octopus too. Everything is amazing, and price is good. Owner and family are super nice, English language friendly  This is meant to be in and out. There are stools available if you need a quick rice box meal.  Owner makes their on lamb and beef briskets, perfect for cold days.  You can get soup or soya milk with your meal, I always go for the soup! Typical chinese homestyle fare, but packed with lots of flavour.  When you have the delicious essence and bones from your meat, its hard to not create wonderful soul-warming soup.  This is a staple fare for my family and workplace.  Its always a treat to go for a satisfying meal, and a friendly chat with the owner."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to us for chinese BBQ.  It is now our go to place when family is craving chinese bbq.  It  is kinda a hole in the wall.  However, the char siu pork and sausages are good, not too salty.  Haven't gotten around to trying the roasted pork with the crispy skin yet, that will be on our next visit.  I deducted 1 star due to CASH ONLY, no debit or credit accepted.  Good soy milk too, got that as part of 2 bbq item on rice combo."}
{"text":"Great tasting food at very reasonable prices. Got a 3 item combo (roast pork, bbq pork & duck leg) on rice, with a side of soup for $8. There was more than enough food for one person.   Everything was really tasty. In particular, the duck leg was really juicy. The bbq pork was different to other places I've tried, but I still enjoyed it. And as others have mentioned, the roast pork is highly recommended.   Great option for take out bbq"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years now.  I'm the Duchess!    I'm always warmly greeted with smiles.  They know how to serve excellent roast pork.  I always come right after 11am and the meats are so fresh!  The roast pork skin is always crispy and the meat is consistently moist.  This is definitely my go-to order.  I pick up at least four lunch boxes at a time.    I have nothing but good things to say about this place so another 5 stars for Ho Ho BBQ!"}
{"text":"Yup, 5 stars! My return visits to this place are always amazing. Truly warm friendly service, amazing food, and not even the seemingly ample, but always packed, really lousy parking can deter me from giving it the full five stars. Why? Because the crispy roast pork is the best I've found anywhere! Perfectly crispy crunchy skin, moist pork, loads of yummy greens, and nice fluffy rice, especially with the extra sauce I always ask for, it all just can't be beat.  GO!  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"FOOD: 2.5 stars PRICE: 4 stars SERVICE: 4 stars  I came here after reading many good reviews about how tasty their food was.  I looked for something to grab it home after picking up my adorable macarons at DaanGo Cake lab.   We ordered 3 boxes of meat on rice; one with roasted pork, another one was roasted duck and the last one was bbq pork.  It comes with either tofu or vegetable on the side.  We only chose vegetable because my husband isn't a fan of tofu. You can also choose to have either a drink or soup along with your meal too.  The price for bbq meat on rice is around $6.50-$8.50.  Isn't it a good deal?  The staff was very nice and friendly.  I wasn't sure if they were the owners or not. I really couldn't tell.  I don't live in the area and it was my first time here.   The portion was generous however the meat was quite dry.  The bbq pork was ok.  It was better than the roasted pork and roasted duck.  The roasted pork wasn't crispy as I expected and there was little meat on the roasted duck.    As all above, the food I ordered was mediocre or maybe it wasn't my day.  Anyway, the price was good.  Three meals were only $22.50!  It's pretty good right!?"}
{"text":"Look.. it's all about love, and this dude here loves to roast up some piggy.  When you're comparing Chinese BBQ places, it starts and ends with Chinese Style roasted pig.  Nevermind that this place is the exclusive supplier of whole roasted baby pigs to all of our family gatherings for the last 6+ years, but  they've always had the piggy ready for us to pick up on time and it's perfect each time.  If it wasn't so far for me, I'd be munching on these lunch boxes once a week.  How can you go wrong for the price of a McD's quarter combo?  You can't.  Ho Ho translates to \"very good\". but man, I'm a Hoe Hoe for Ho Ho."}
{"text":"This is the most delicious and friendliest place to get chinese BBQ. They literally PACK your box with meat. I will be coming here all the time now, and i've only been here once!!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for cheap Chinese eats. Especially when it comes to duck, soy sauce chicken, red sausage etc.   This place is by far the best that I have been to. It's a bang for your buck with the 2 items for 7.50 taxes in and it includes soy milk or soup. The soup by the way was delicious and so hot. We drove to Burlington and it was still steaming!   Awesome service the lady is very nice there. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My go to bbq pork in town. The environment is clean and staff are friendly. The crispness of the pork is done to perfection and you can always buy as little as half a pound!   It is in a mall filled with other competitors but I find this one is the least salty and tend to get more customers as well. Be ware coming on big holidays like chinese new year.... we waited almost 3 hours for bbq pork this chinese new year!!!!! Also cash only (like most independent chinese bbq stores)"}
{"text":"Dropped by today to pick up some roast pork after reading the wonderful reviews. I got the roast pork and rice combo for $5.99 and my sister ordered a BBQ chicken leg with rice for $5.50. The pork was super crispy with lots of flavour and the chicken was juicy and tender. In fact, my sister who was sitting next to me in the car could hear the crackling sound when I bit into it...it's that crispy. The lady behind the counter (probably the owner) was very kind and friendly. She offered me some BBQ pork to try, which was good, but the roast pork wins hands down. Will definitely be going back again!!!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area when I saw this place (back of the building going to McNicoll eastward). I ordered roast pork and sausage meal for $6.50 and boy the portion is huge! The size is that of what you normally get for a $10 to $12 meal. You got to choose soy milk or soup as well.  Taste wise its delicious as well. The roast pork is still crispy and juicy and the sausage is tasty. Side dish serves as good palate cleanser as well.   Overall I like the food here and value ranks high. Service is friendly as well."}
{"text":"I don't really like Chinese food but the roast pork and bbq pork was DELICIOUS! Definitely Going to recommend to friends & family"}
{"text":"Best roast pork and baby roast pork (weekends only) in Toronto! Highly recommend going here for the roast pork/baby roast pork. I've tried these items at many of Toronto's restaurants (Chinatown to high end) and Ho Ho is still the best. Don't be fooled by the lacklustre appearance of the place!"}
{"text":"The roast pork was so good! It was juicy and tender. Reasonably priced and excellent service. Make sure to bring cash since it's cash only."}
{"text":"What else do you think I would do the day after having Mock Roast Pork at Joe Yee? Maybe I'm getting too predictable, my apologies. I walked inside and notice the BBQ Cook standing there and after realizing I am there he went to the back and started asking questions as he should do.   Communication is KEY and he knows this fact as I asked for Roast Pork. He then ask me how many people will be eating as he inspected the Roast Pig or what's left of it at this late night hour. 1.01 pound of Roast Pork was cut out. 1-one hundredth OFF the mark, that's impressive!   In this Chinese BBQ environment, there is a Hierarchy that you should be aware of. It is mostly AGE based, then secondly Regulars. This knowledge is crucial when you are in friendly conversation with the Cook. If you are under the age of 50, your best strategy is to bring your Chinese Parents, Grandparents, or even Great Grandparents into the conversation.  The result is \"My Father\" gets an extra Fried Tofu, comped. Also we get leaner cuts of Meat, since I don't want \"My Father\" to eat too FATTY.  Roast Pork Rib($7.50/lb) did have a CRISPY Crackling Skin with a smooth Fat Layer underneath.  The Meat was A-OK maybe slightly dry but that's my fault for coming so late to see the last quarter of the Pig.  The BBQ rub wasn't as intense savoury as I would like but others might like it if they don't like too much Salt in their diet.  Roast Duck had the similar attributes where I'm used to more savouriness for that addictiveness.  I need to go again when they have it FRESH out of the fire but for now Ho Ho BBQ'd it's way to 3.5 *Star* on my List."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Roast pork & roast duck, both are soooo delicious! We patronize this place every few months or so, because the roast pork is so good, it's like an addiction we can't get rid of!   I have tried many many Chinese BBQ all over Asia, some were sold in incredibly cheap stalls, and others in very expensive hotels, and I can definitely say that the chef here is a real master at roasting whole pig. The skin is so delicious & crispy, while the meat is juicy and tender.   However don't just take my word for it, you can even read it directly from the experts because Mr. Wong was featured in a gourmet magazine article by Francis Lam back in 2009 entitled \"The Last Chinese BBQ\"   http://www.gourmet.com/magazine/2000s/2009/08/ho-ho-bbq.html  Additionally, the proprietress who is handling the cashier is always so friendly with us every time we come - she remembers everybody's faces! She is always so cheery when we drop by.   Lastly, this place has such a steady following that even we are starting to remember a few of their regular clients- something which has never happened to us before. So if you're a fan of roast pork, this is definitely the place to be!"}
{"text":"I'm incredibly disappointed. Apparently, I ordered the wrong things. Karen L's been telling me to come for ages. I should have asked her what to get before I went. My bad.  I ordered 1 lb of half fat half lean BBQ pork just so we could compare it to other places' BBQ pork. The first sign that something was off was that there was no line up here when we got there around 6pm on a Sunday night. Another BBQ place in this plaza had a line out the door at the same time. The second sign was that the BBQ pork was an odd bright red color.   When I got to Grandma's and actually tried the BBQ pork, I discovered that they didn't give me half fat half lean pork. They gave me all lean pork. That was quite upsetting. Then, I tasted it. It tastes like it's homemade. Actually, I prefer the stuff I make myself. If that's the case, I wouldn't bother buying here, especially as it's not particularly cheap either.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here based on the yelp rating and boy did it deliver!  The plaza isn't anything much other than a couple of other BBQ places, a depressing food court and a larger family restaurant but Ho Ho BBQ is worth the trip.  I ordered the BBQ pork and half a roast duck.  I picked it up in the late morning, kept it on my kitchen table during the day as the person who served me advised me not to refrigerate it and it was served at around 6:30. By the time the serving plate made the round and came back to me, most of it was gone. I'm lucky I snuck in a few pieces once I got home. It was from those few pieces I knew that I picked the right place. My only disappointment was not buying enough."}
{"text":"After some Yelp researching, it seems like Ho Ho BBQ is the best chinese BBQ place, or at least one of the better ones, so what's the verdict? While I'm no expert on chinese BBQ, the meat here was of good quality, and beats the stuff you can get from any grocery store. Though I'm not entirely convinced you should come out of your way here to have it.   We went with their half roast duck and some roast pork. Pricing was $12 for the duck and $10/lb, more pricey than your super market BBQ, but quality always comes at a price. But if you're coming here for their combos, the pricing is a lot more reasonable. I really do think it's much more worth it and I wish we did that.   Okay so now for the meat! The first thing was that the near wasn't overly salty yet still really flavorful, and that the meat is on the lean side, yet still being tender. There's not a lot of fat between the meat and skin. (Huge fan of lean meat btw!). The sauce for the duck was separately served in those small containers and I really appreciate that! The five spice really comes through here wonderfully unlike some other places were the salt just masks everything. The roast pork was just excellent. The skin was so crisp, that you just had to gobble it up, and it was so tender! I loved it, and prefer it to the roasted duck for sure."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best roast pork in the GTA. Large portions, pork had crispy skin and was well seasoned.  Order when its right out of the oven...I usually ask for medium-fat meat.  Ive also tried their goose and that was good as well.  Owners are very nice."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, just stroll on into this place and secure yourself some yummy BBQ or roast pork goodness on the cheap, I was a bit concerned that since I myself am not chineese that I may have an issue ordering, not the case. So don't be scurred' yo, you miss out if you don't hit up places like this. Do it."}
{"text":"This Chinese BBQ place is a top notch place.  Phenomenal bbq pork and roast pork and duck.    Savoury and delicious!  Incredible depth of flavour.    Excellent value.  Highly recommended  Check out the two rice noodle places in the food court - west street and the one to the right of it"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Despite the cramped size of their BBQ shop, the owners are the most friendliest folks to deal with!"}
{"text":"Teeny tiny place in a plaza with other Chinese BBQ joints. Great value for your meal where $6.50 gets you a generous portion of rice topped with Chinese BBQ pork and roast pork, veggie side and a bottle of water or soy milk. The BBQ was tender and heavy on the fresh ginger and Chinese 5 spice. The roast pork was also tender with a crispy skin and little fat, it tasted like they just seasoned the meat with salt. Great meal if you're a starving carnivore. Friendly staff who understand English but speak a mile-a-minute with a thick accent, so you may have to have them repeat what they said."}
{"text":"Owner Couple are very friendly. Super great deal and the portions are big and taste is excellent!! Gave us extra pieces in our Rice 2 Option Lunch Boxes! Definitely will go back! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ho Ho BBQ is my go-to for authentic take-out Chinese BBQ. I go normally go here after my church service to get lunch. I usually get the BBQ pork with veggies and rice, or the roast pork with the same stuff. It's gotten to the point where they know me now, so they assume what I want to order. It's cool and easy that way LOL. Ho Ho, you're great :)"}
{"text":"A quest to find BBQ buns brought me to this plaza. I've never been here before. I never even knew this was a shopping mall. I thought it was an office complex. I drive past here all the time!  I was quite surprised to find three BBQ shops in this tiny plaza, practically next to each other. Not knowing anything about these establishments, I chose the one with the longest lineup. Good choice!  I bought two pounds of crispy roast pork to take to work for my colleagues. Like other reviewers have said, the service was very friendly. I was even asked what cut of the pig I preferred. I've rarely ever been asked that. I chose the belly, of course. The skin was still crispy and the meat still juicy an hour and a half later when we ate it. Very good!  Unfortunately, that brings up a dilemma. Do I try one of the other shops next time I come to this plaza or do I stick with what I now know? Hmmm..."}
{"text":"This place is great! Definitely beats any of the other Chinese BBQ place in the same plaza as well as the food court! This is great value for what you get. Two types of meat along with rice and veggies for about $7 all in, comes in daily soup! The roast pork skin was deliciously crispy, as with the duck skin! The portion was large and came with ample of meat.  The owners are extremely friendly and they also speak English which is a nice change. It's typically hard to converse with the owners at places like these!"}
{"text":"7 bucks for 2 BBQ items, rice, veggies, soup.  the roast pork is some of the best I've had. Very nice and hospitable owners.  This will be on my list of regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"Ordered crispy roasted pork belly and bbq pork. We went there just in time before they were closing. Want to say that the owner gave discount but the food also already discounted ( gravy wasn't enough on bbq pork) and it was abit dry to my taste. Crispy skin pork belly was fine and the gravy was good. I was hoping better quality but maybe i will keep looking for other store."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Ho Ho BBQ.  Since my beloved Pink Hong moved up to Woodbine and Hwy 7, I was searching for a new Chinese BBQ joint for those special family dinners and occasional cravings.    Last time I was here, I remember the wait being long and food being just average.  This time, the wait was super long (almost an hour) in a crammed storefront with line up out the door and the food being average....again.    Of course the long wait can be attributed to the fact that it was a Chinese New Year's eve and everybody was out trying to get their BBQ items.  However, let's be honest here.  The folks at Ho Ho may be nice but they're not the most efficient bunch.  We were packed in their small store like sardines with 1 or 2 patrons leaving every 10- 15 minutes.  Really?  What could be taking so long since all the food is cooked and all the staffers had to do was to pack the food and cash out.  Since I did not want to go to another place, I waited....and waited.....and waited some more until I finally got my roast  pork ribs, a whole steamed chicken (free range) and char siu after an hour's wait.    The worst part of the ordeal was the food though.  Roast pork was just ho hum compared to Pink Hong's; the skin was crunchy, not crispy.  There is a difference.  The meat was a little dried out.  The \"country style\" steamed chicken was ok as well but I'm not sure if I would pay the extra $7 next time for this type over the regular steamed chicken.  The skin was a little too rubbery for  my liking and again, the meat, a little dry.  The Char siu was the best thing out of my order with nicely charred and glazed pieces without the meat being over seasoned as you find at many places.    Still, I miss my Pink Hong and will be on the look out for another Chinese BBQ to raise to the occasion for our next craving.    Will I come back to Ho Ho?  Not likely."}
{"text":"Its Chinese BBQ done right. The roast pork had a chrunchalicious skin and the meat itself was juicy and not overly salted like in many other Chinese BBQ joints. The place is very small and there is the typical meat display where you see roasted duck and pig hanging from a hook in all its glory.  Its a good place to pick up some meat for takeout or if you are looking for some pigalicious awesomeness then you can even get a whole roasted baby piglet for $158. Poor baby piglet (nom, nom, nom).  There service is very friendly if you speak the language. While putting through my order he the butcher asked if I wanted to sample what I just ordered. Of course I could not turn that down."}
{"text":"The owners are the sweetest people ever. We went almost at closing time and they were kind enough to stay back for a bit to serve us. The portion of our takeout was really huge, especially for such a low price. The meat was also very fresh. I would definitely recommend this place for Chinese BBQ. One box of takeout is enough to feed me for two meals."}
{"text":"This place is an untapped gem!  Generous portion for Roast Pork/BBQ Pork & Rice - it was only $6!!! They know the proper way to make real Roast Pork! The owners were so nice they even gave me a soy milk (which was made with real soy.)"}
{"text":"Pros: Awesome prices Honest service  Cons: Cash only  I think I may have found my new favourtie Chinese BBQ place.  Again, I have Yelp to thank for this find because you would never find this place otherwise.  Ho Ho Barbeque doesn't face the street so it can be tough to find if you're looking for it in particular.  This place is the definition of a hidden gem.  It's a small place nestled in a plaza at Midland and McNicoll.  The place is super tiny, just enough to fit everything in.  There's 2 chairs and a aisle to sit if you really want, but take out is the way to go.  What stands out immediately is the prices.  Most places now charge close to $10 or more for a pound of BBQ pork.  The price here, $7.50.  You're not comprising quality here for the price too.  The meats here are just as good as anywhere else.  You'll find the prices are about 2 to 3 dollars cheaper across the board for everything you usually find at a Chinese BBQ place.  2 things stand out for me the most here.  First, they have a curry beef brisket.  It's hard to find Chinese BBQ places that to curry beef brisket anymore.  It used to be more frequent but most places have stopped doing it.  You get a large order here for $8.50, that's a win.    Second, the service her is amazing.  I usually get my BBQ pork a little on the fatty side.  When I placed my order, the butcher took a look and couldn't find any.  Rather than try to sell me something I didn't want and pretend it was still fatty, he honestly told me he didn't have any and asked if I wanted to wait 10 minutes for some new ones that would be fatty.  Let me tell you, most places would not do that.  They would of just chose something remotely close to what I wanted and that would be that.  The fact that he was so honest about what he's selling impressed the heck out of me.  The only thing bad I can say about this place is the cash only policy but that's nothing new for these kind of places.  I love Ho Ho Barbeque.  Like I said, it's my new go to for Chinese BBQ and any fan should definitely try this place out as well."}
{"text":"Was around the area today and decided that I feel for some Chinese BBQ.. you know that feeling you get when you drive by somewhere and you get a whiff of BBQ pork or duck and then \"BAM\"  I need my BBQ now!!!   Normally I only go to my beloved Kum Hong BBQ in Richmond Hill as I always consider them the ultimate BBQ shop but since I was in the area, I decided to check Ho Ho BBQ based on reviews I saw on Yelp.  The first thing I noticed that this plaza across from the Yee Hong Centre has THREE (3) Chinese BBQ places almost next to each other which is kinda insane when you think about it so you need to make sure you are going to the right one.  When you first enter this tiny shop, you can tell that the couple that runs this place are really, really nice.  They seem very friendly and genuinely appreciative to the customers that come in which is huge plus.  You rarely see this in any take out place especially a Chinese one:)    So onto the BBQ... I always base the quality of the BBQ on the same order... Roast Pork and BBQ Pork on rice combo.  These are the 2 items that for me define a good BBQ joint.  I have to say the portions are huge here!  They give a lot of BBQ on heaping pile of rice, along with a fried tofu/vegetable side and a choice of soybean or soup for $6.50 plus tax!  I have to admit it's a great deal!  BTW take the soup option, its really good!  Both the Roast Pork and BBQ Pork were nice and tender with good flavour.  Not too much fat as I prefer my meat a little leaner and the accompanied sauce matches well with the rice.  It's not as good as my Kum Hong but to be honest it's definitely better then most places so I would definitely recommend to anyone one in the area.  There is only about 2 stools by the window and unlike what some people have mentioned, you cannot take the food into the foodcourt to eat!  I got kicked out so had to eat in the car as I was told only the food court items can be eaten at the tables:)  Felt like I committed a crime or something!  Haha!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners are very hospitable, prompt and so pleasantly cute. THEY KNOW THEIR BBQ and I have never been disappointed. My favourites have to be the Roast pork and their curry, my husband loves their bbq pork. Roast pork is moist but has a crispy pork skin to it. The meat has Never been dry when i have ordered it, it has always been succulent and flavourful. You need to try here!   A really small shop, but they have bar stools in the front to eat at, very popular with take out. Very clean and tidy as well which is a huge plus. Combos can come with soya milk or home made soup. The soup changes but they are worth trying! Did i mention how cheap it is too? Paid $7 for 2 item bbq with soya milk and side of Chinese vegetable inside! Nom nom!"}
{"text":"It's hard to write a review that will do Ho Ho justice.  Cooking meat this way is labor intensive, hot, and uncomfortable.  On top of that, at five bucks for an overladen tray of pork, it's a low profit margin venture.  All this just means that you should go to Ho Ho.  It's certainly not a health food binge, but neither is the pork nearly as greasy, gristly or flavorless as it often is at these places.  I agree with Wayne that the rub was light, but that's the way I like it.  The pig was good, the meat was fresh, and it was cooked so to the point of perfection that more flavor might have been superfluous.   It goes without saying that the staff is generous and friendly.  Extra pieces of roast pork and fatback (maybe they thought my wife and I were hiding three or four children in our trunk?) and a complimentary bottle of water, which I accepted.  Hey, we all make concessions against our environmental principles when the most delicious pig is involved."}
{"text":"The BBQ pork is crispy and moist, however meat is leaning towards the bland side. I think BBQ pork in general needs to be well seasoned for it to be really tasty (my preference). The flavours/spice is different from other chinese BBQ places and it's nice and fragrant. The  person assisting me with my order was very friendly and customer oriented. He added some pork trotters on top of my order, on the house."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, and the food comes with options of tea or soup. Quick service, food is packed well. I recommend the tea instead of soup because you will feel thirsty when you eat barbecue, and soup is too hot to drink for me, I have to wait a long time for it to cool down. It is pretty standard for Chinese because they prefer it hot that way, any kind of liquid from soup, tea, water, etc."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much the epitome of \"hole in the wall.\" Tucked into a little strip mall, the restaurant is unassuming from the outside and tiny on the inside. There are no dine-in options - it's take-out only.  When you walk inside, you'll be able to see all the roast meats hanging and spinning. If the doors to the back room are open, you can even see the chefs chopping up the raw meat just two meters away. At the counter, you can see some of the side dishes on display, to help you decide what to order.  The menu has a variety of options, including duck, pork, and chicken, as well as sides such as vegetables and rice. I ended up getting the roast duck with steamed bok choy on the side. The roast duck was delicious - though quite messy to eat, due to all of the juices and bones. The steamed bok choy was lackluster.  The food was tasty and the tiny half restaurant / half butcher shop was quite an experience. It's worth a stop if you're craving some meat and aren't afraid of the grittier environment."}
{"text":"Came a little too late to get the fresh meat, but still loved the friendly people working there, the generous portions, the suggestions of when the best time to come is.  She gave me and my two friends 3 plates, with rice, veggies, and three types of pork, plus 3 drinks for 18.00. Best deal I've ever gotten.  Will come back here and hope to bump this 4 up to a 5."}
{"text":"Best cut BBQ pork rice. $7 and they're not stingy. The pork is delicious and has less fat than other places. Quick service and the food is flavourful."}
{"text":"I like my roast pork and have sampled roast pork at many places. This place has the best tasting roast pork by far. They use higher quality pigs. The price here is very reasonable for the best roast pork."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious meals by a mom and pop shop! The ratings don't lie - this place is definitely worth dropping by.   Their BBQ meat is super tender, tasty, and juicy. They load the lunch boxes up to the brim and gave my mom and I some extra meat to go (and for $6.50 - what a steal).   All their prices are extremely reasonable, especially since the combo comes with a soup or soy milk drink.  We tried their roasted duck, BBQ pork, sausage, and crispy pork. All of it was delicious. It's so good that I'm stopping by again before I leave Toronto.  My sister also tried the lunch box and was pleasantly surprised. She wasn't expecting to eat, but saw a box of it and asked for a bite.  I will definitely be making this a regular spot to drop by!  TL;DR Tasty and cheap place to get some high quality Chinese BBQ meat! Come here for takeout only."}
{"text":"If you miss your chance to try their roast pork or duck, then you are missing out in life.  Sure, it looks like your average Chinese BBQ joint, but if you about it, if they can compete with 5~7 other eateries in the same 100 meter vicinity, and maintain such high ratings throughout all these years, they have to be doing something right!"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday late afternoon, and the staffs were eating. They quickly greeted me and got up to ask what I wanted to get. It was a surprisingly awesome experience at this small Chinese bbq shop!  I order 2 items combo rice of roasted pork and bbq pork, as well as half a duck and it came out to be a little over $20 including tax. What a steal for the quality and portion! While I was waiting, one of the staff offered me to sample their bbq pork..what great service!  I wish I lived close by and I'll definitely patron more often!"}
{"text":"Ordered:  Roasted pork Cha siu Whole duck  Expectations: Really high (all reviews are so good)  Reality:  Like many reviews on this place; it was amazing. I dont usually get roasted pork anywhere unless im cooking it in something because usually the meat is very dry. But this pork was different. Not only did it have the crispy skin, it also had so much flavor and was super tender.  Cha siu was pretty good, next time I come here I have to remember to ask for more of that sauce she poured on top. Noted she also let me choose how lean I wanted my meat.  Lastly was the roasted duck. I was making peking duck with it so I didnt ask for it to be chopped; when I got home to open it up, I was surprised to see there were so much spices inside making the duck super flavorful and aromatic.   All in all no disappointment here, and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have an acquaintance who loves chinese lacquered bbq pork. He makes a point to post everything that he tries on instagram. I never cared for these things until I was completely deprived of it for the last 5 years while looking at his photos and all of a sudden, it's the one item i NEEDED to eat in Toronto. Rather than playing detective on his instagram, I just came on Yelp to find the best rated bbq pork in the  neighbourhood and came upon this place.   When I arrived, what I found odd was that this plaza is a line of bbq restaurants all selling the exact same thing. A search on Yelp reveals that none of the other restaurants have been reviewed. In fact, while Ho Ho was void of people, its neighbour had a line of old asian folks, which makes me wonder whether we are making the right choice.   Nonetheless, as a borderline millennial, i needed to trust my phone app instead of old chinese people eating chinese food and went with Ho Ho instead. I got two of the combination bento boxes that had rice with bbq pork, roast pig, and roast duck (plus a salty duck egg i couldnt say no to and none of us ate them). The service was not too friendly until the lady saw my husband come in after me with my 4 month old baby who smartly smiled at her for my convenience. The lady decided then we were worthy of love and continuously told us how cute my baby is and how we needed to eat the food hot and not leave it in the car for too long since it was a hot day and the bbq will go bad quickly.  I got home, opened the box, and man, the portion was CRAZY BIG. I ate everything except for the duck egg. My husband too for his box. We were in a food coma for a very long time. The bbq didn't wow me, but it was solid good. I may venture next door next time though, just for comparison sake, especially since my baby wont be 4 months anymore and may not get me the love that I'd like to have from strangers."}
{"text":"Recently ordered a whole roasted Baby Pig and Master Wong did not disappoint.  The pickup was very smooth and the display was amazing.  The texture of the roasted meat was excellent and everyone enjoyed the display and quality of Master Wong's well honed craft.  I definitely will be back to get another whole roasted baby pig if not mid sized for any special occasion!"}
{"text":"hmm hmm hmm. obviously they only take cash which resulted in having to drive 9 blocks away to a scotiabank and return, but wow was it ever worth it. Roasted pork, skin so cripsy, oh my god. Barbecued pork, oh my good flesh so tender. Didnt try the duck but it was highly recommended and the chef gave us some deep fried crab to try which was equally delicious. Just so you guys know, this place was rated the best chinese bbq spot in North America by \"Gourmet\" magazine, which is now out of business but has been considered the premier restaurant review publication of our time. (read review here: http://www.gourmet.com/magazine/2000s/2009/08/ho-ho-bbq)  Go there, now."}
{"text":"Finally make it to Ho Ho BBQ and I got to try the Roasted Pork that Tony F has been talking about all these time.   Ho Ho BBQ is quite small, it is more of a take out place but does have a little bar stool area facing the street if one do decide to eat in.   Roasted Pork and Roasted Duck with Rice ($5.50)  - Roasted Pork is A-OK. The skin oh so oh so crispy!! crack crack crunch crunch in your mouth crispy! The meat is also nice and tender. Not too salty.  - Roasted Duck is A-OK too! I was given the breast portion but even they are not dark meat, they are nice and juicy and soft.  - love the large portion of veggie that comes with the order   The man that preparing my lunchbox was so nice!! He asked me if I need extra pork and if the serving he gave me was enough for me! (Hey maybe I have this hungry look in my eyes or I look like a pig :P) I told him the more the better!   Cash only!"}
{"text":"I have never had service this good. A mom and pop store to the fullest. The owners are so sweet and so caring. When you walk in, it does look a bit dingy but don't be fooled but the atmosphere- the food is delicious. Make sure you try the BBQ Pork and Duck. So tasty! Very affordable!"}
{"text":"Been going here for awhile. They have one of the best BBQ pork and duck and the price is good.  You also get a side of drink or soup  One word to describe: succulent   Owners are always friendly and service is fast"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last week and ordered:  2 BBQ meat, vegetable and rice - I chose roast pork and bbq chicken. Roast pork was one of the best I've had at these BBQ places. The BBQ chicken was very good as well. I was given a choice of bottled water or soup, so chose the soup. I was delightfully surprised when I got home to find the soup contained actual ingredients - winter melon and pieces of chicken inside - unlike other chinese BBQ places. I also got the sauce on the side in a separate  container which I ended up using as the rice was a bit on the dry side   Service was also excellent, I was welcomed by the husband and wife duo immediately upon entering the establishment.   Value is excellent since I got two meals worth of food for only $6.25  Only drawbacks of this place are:  1) location - compared to let's say New Sun BBQ which is located in the food court which gets more foot traffic  2) lack of seating - compared to New Sun BBQ which is located in the food court with ample seating   3) hours - being closed early and not open on Wednesday means potential customers flock to New Sun BBQ instead. The New Sun BBQ sign right next to the store certainly doesn't help   It is really unfortunate that on the Thursday night I came, there were a lot more customers at New Sun BBQ (low quality food, high prices, questionable business practices) than this gem.   Overall, A++++++ great value I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Honestly, i dont know what the hype is about..  its good ... i like it but it isnt spectacular in my opinion...  they are very friendly i will give them that.  they gave my friend extra pieces of roast pork even though he did not order it.    i would return if i was in the area and craving bbq... but the question is ..will they be open?  everytime i come by usually they are closed.."}
{"text":"Came here because of the fine Yelp reviews, and I was NOT disappointed.  The staff were so incredibly friendly that I was actually a little uncomfortable. I ordered two items on rice (plenty of BBQ pork and a good amount of duck on a standard takeout container of rice, but you can choose what meats you want) for the low price of 6$ plus tax. Then the hostess offered me a drink from the fridge, so I got a bottle of water. She actually told me the bottles on the side were colder because they'd been in there longer. Then she offered me free Bok Choi or Tofu. Then she offered me free crackling (pig skin). She offered me soy sauce but I was a bit hesitant (not knowing what kind of sauce she was offering) so she put some in a little takeout container and I ended up using it.   I left with a huge (if not exactly heart-healthy) dinner for under 7$. As I sat conspicuously in the security booth of the mall and ate my meal, I quickly became full. I considered that other, better people would probably pack up their meals and have the rest for a snack later. I contemplated how incredible it was that I got that much moist and tasty roast pork and delicious (if standard) duck for so cheap. I asked myself how such an incredible restaurant existed in today's atmosphere of 10$ sandwiches and widespread gouging. I literally said \"What is this place?\" to myself a few times. I wondered why I am not incredibly fat right now, and eventually finished my delicious meal.  5/5, highly recommended. It's always Christmas at Ho Ho BBQ, so get over there.  P.S. The glaze on the BBQ pork is indeed light, but it's still really tasty. The crackling is like eating delicious greasy cancer, but it was pretty nice when paired with some Bok Choi."}
{"text":"Best roasted pork we've ever tasted on this planet. Any animal they cook is awesome. If they cooked pig anus it'll probably taste like heaven. And sometimes they even give samples while waiting in line if you're a new customer. They know their stuff is the tits and it shows. Very friendly and a great service. We actually stopped looking for a better place coz we've found it. 3 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place had given us so much food and it comes with a drink too.  BBQ Pork, Roast Pork ( Crispy Pork), Soya Chicken and Roast duck. Pick any meat of a bed of white rice and blanched Chinese vegetables. Yum, right?  YES!  We had a little hard time communicating since my Chinese was so rusty but thanks to previous yelp pics, we were able to get what we wanted. The employees had great customer service as well.Even though, the store opens at 11am, they open at 10:30am and we saw some lines already.   We got the lunches or platters and it came with a drink for CAD 6.50 per box. My husband and I looked at each other and we were like, that couldn't be right! We saw how much food we were getting and also the drinks too!! No way, but yes we did..  Great customer service+ ample & tasty food+ Affordability= One Very Happy Customer    Tip: Cash Only and there's barely any place in there to sit down and eat. What we did, we got the food and went to a park to eat. :D"}
{"text":"This was also a place that was not open on our previous visits to the area.  We wanted some rice plates for our ride home. We got a chicken & roast duck combo & a roast pork & char siu combo. The guy threw in a couple of pieces of tofu after chit chatting that we were from Boston.  The lady wasn't as friendly but I don't expect it from these types of establishments.  The lunch boxes come with a choice of Chinese drinks i.e.: soy milk, chrysanthemum tea.   Looking at the prices we HAD to get a pound of their roast pork & char siu. $6.99 lb   Canadian works out to roughly a little over $5 lb. US that's unheard of here for that price. The lunch boxes were around 7.50 each and they stuff the box.  We ended up eating the food the next day. I wasn't a fan of the char siu. - got a too lean piece. But the flavor of roast pork was phenomenal. The piece was quite fatty but reheating it in the toaster oven rendered some of the fat and crisped up the skin nicely.  (Fatty is definitely better than getting a lean piece.) The chicken & duck were good as well.  Will be back. Just need to remember what day they are closed. I think it's Wednesday's."}
{"text":"I tried Ho Ho after reading Francis Lam's poignant review in the old Gourmet. I have been pleased with every visit, and the proprietors remembered me on the second visit.  The crispy, succulent roast pork is always good, but I try not to  choose it when there is not much left and they are not bringing out  the next half hog.  BBQ pork has been a bit dry, but maybe I should specify moist, as they chop it to order, and without attitude!   Roast duck, and BBQ cuttlefish are excellent.  I tried lemon roast chicken but it was slightly dry. I tend to stay with roast pork, duck, and some seafood here, and have never been disappointed.  Ho Ho would be a good choice for a large take out or picnic order, but I would pre-arrange it and pre-pay so they have it ready when I drop back.  For a hole-in-the-wall, this place is a gem."}
