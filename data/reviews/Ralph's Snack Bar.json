{"text":"We love Ralph's Snack Bar! They come to our office everyday for lunch, they are always on time with a friendly cashier and a cook. The food is always great and a fair price. So, if you want great value, good food and friendly service call these guys!"}
{"text":"This place started off great with great food, they come out to my work place everyday out here to tempe. The lady's also started off really nice. I had gotten a chicken salad one time and a little roach was in my salad. It was really disgusting, so I contacted my manager. Apparently, I was not the only one with the roach issue. NEVER again after that have I ate there. Now, they drive a new food truck, and the lady's dont talk to me. Which I can care less. But it was a horrible experience and hopefully no one ever has to go through something like this."}
{"text":"Good food. Ordered patty melt and fries. Loved the prices and being able to walk out to my yard."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Prices are pretty good. I generally order the Carne Asada Tacos (I love the red salsa, I could drink it) They are $1.50 each, and 2 is the perfect amount for me.  My only complaint is the guy that takes the money. Sometimes he just seems downright angry, and rude. He REALLY doesn't like you to take more than one salsa, I mean jeeeez man...Relax! I'll pay extra! 
The lady that makes the food is super sweet, and really fast!
***I do have to mention that one time my friend did find a piece of metal in her taco, looked like a staple. That was gross... but apparently not gross enough for me to stop eating there. HA!"}
{"text":"Love love love this truck!! They are prompt arriving to my employer. Courteous 100% of the time. 
Delicious cheese fries, carne asada tacos, burgers, breakfast, anything I've ordered from there is so good...I guess that's why I keep going back. Everything is affordable. I think for breakfast I had eggs potatoes meat toast for like 5.00."}
{"text":"I really like this snack truck.  I asked them to make me a custom veggie burro and it was wonderful.  They have 3 kinds of salsas and I really enjoyed the green one best."}
{"text":"This food truck has truly ruined my morning. They got my order wrong not once but twice!!!! I asked for a bacon egg sandwich on a bagel w/ butter. No CHEESE!!!!!! They made a bacon egg w/ cheese on a English muffin, when my boyfriend said they messed up and he wanted no cheese on the sandwich. They make it again w/cheese and changed the bacon to sausage!!! Like WTF!! Not everyone like cheese, and since it is a mobile business you'd think they would make sure to get the order right instead of just making whatever they feel like!! I'm extremely disappointed and probably won't be going back to this food truck ever again!!! And there is no way to track their drivers by routes, you would have to know the truck number or the drivers name!!! And who asks for the drivers name when your trying to on your food!!! Anyway I'm mad, hungry, and still waiting for them to track this driver!!! I wish they had no stars since that's what they deserve."}
{"text":"Ralph's truck runs by my office in north Scottsdale almost every afternoon. NOTHING can beat the the convenience factor, instead of spending 15 minutes fighting airpark traffic to buy a crappy burger, I just roll out to the back of my building and order some fresh tacos. 

The prices are pretty decent and the food quality is good (but look, it's still got a fast food element to it so we aren't talking gourmet but it's pretty decent!)

The cook and the driver are SUPER NICE and always have a great attitude when I see them. 

If you see them driving around, flag them down for some yummies! :)"}
{"text":"Ralph's snack bar/food truck comes to my place of employment in the evenings in hopes of feeding employees. There are a select few employees who rely on Ralph's for dinner most nights but for others, it's kinda 50/50. 

Anyways, I decided to try it one night when I didn't feel like driving anywhere. I ordered the carne asada burrito- it had rice, beans, carne asada of course, sour cream, and pico de gallo for a total of $6. Not bad for a pretty hefty burrito. I decided to order it again a few weeks later, but this time, it only had rice, beans, and a lot less carne asada. I'm not sure whether you have to ask for the pico de gallo and sour cream, but I know I didn't have to the first time around. And as for half the amount of meat: unacceptable. 

Needless to say, I was disappointed because of the lack of consistency. I thought I would be receiving exactly what I ordered the first time around. I feel that toppings like sour cream, pico de gallo, salsa, etc are essential for taste when it comes to certain Mexican food items. Of course, by the time I realized it was lacking the toppings I was expecting when I ordered the same carne asada burrito as last time, the truck had already taken off. The burrito was so bland without the toppings that I threw it out 1/4 of the way through. And since there was hardly any meat, I wasn't really down for a rice and bean burrito...

Like I said, Ralph's food truck comes to my work so yes, I will probably be ordering again at some point in the future, but I will be either ordering something different or being very specific about what I want in the burrito. You should too and you'll probably be fine."}
{"text":"Ralph's Snack Bar was at a school event this week.  I hadn't eaten all day, so tacos sounded really good to me.  I did have to wait in line for a while, but that was expected at an event with so many people.  I ordered the carne asada tacos.  There were actually pretty good.  Not wonderful or the best I have ever had, but good.  I ordered two tacos and a soda.  It came out to $7.  I felt like that was a little high for two tacos.  But maybe I'm wrong."}
{"text":"They come on base all the time. I usually eat from the blue one but the other day I ordered from this one. I got a supreme breakfast burrito and man was it delicious. There very clean and have good food and good service. I don't remember what I got from the first time. But I know it was something breakfast related. They have lunch and dinner but I think the blue one has more breakfast variety. If you haven't had this before, you should try it!! I'll have to take a pic of my food sometime!"}
{"text":"One of Ralph's trucks now stops by my office location in Tempe.  They have quality freshly made food for low prices!  Anything from breakfast sandwiches/burritos to lunch and drinks.  I'm impressed with how fast they can make the food.  

They also accept credit cards for at $.50 fee.

They are definitely a big hit at our office!"}
{"text":"Can't be beat for prices and convenience. Ra√∫l knows me by name because of the several stops a week I make."}
{"text":"This place is at my husband's work every day and the people who work there always give him his food last. No matter if he orders first, or what he orders, he always gets it last. The food might be ok, but the racism definitely isn't. If you guys could get past the color of some ones skin and treat people fairly, you might have some more customers and better reviews."}
{"text":"Price change for certain customers and Carne asada fries only had a little bit of meat"}
{"text":"Only use them once a year for about a month.  They cater to the Arizona state fair grounds & understand the needs of us carnie folk. This year there was an issue with getting them on the fair grounds however,  the supervisor director of Ralph 's was professional & was able to resolve the situation.  The people are polite & get to know you on first name basis.  The food is excellent over all for the past 5 years it has been a great experience."}
{"text":"Very expensive for chips and energy drinks that i paid 9 dollars for in which case is more than expensive than vending machines."}
{"text":"They come out to our construction site everyday. The food is reliable, tasty, and appropriately priced. What really brings this place over the top is the people who work for them. There are two women who come out to our site on 44th St everyday and they are so sweet and friendly. Couldn't ask for anything more from a food truck. Plus it appears to be solar powered. That is a plus."}
{"text":"Fix your menus. Started a bad experience by being told, after a few minutes, I was looking at the wrong menu. If it is the wrong menu why is it 3 feet tall and fixed to the side of your truck? After being given the option to order off of the very limited, randomly placed selection of food photos, I ordered the California burger. The one marked $5.50 in two separate places. I was then told it would be $7.50, because apparently the avocado on a California burger is extra. At this point I just walked away. If I can't clearly order from you and be charged the listed price you're not worth the time, or the cost."}
{"text":"Overall Good. I had the carne asada burrito. Large and filling. The carne could have been seasoned a little more and possibly some pico or other items in the burrito other than the carne, beans, and rice but overall a good burrito for the price."}
{"text":"Great service until today, they serve our dealership everyday and is usually great... Today the (new) lady driver saw that the 6 Washbay kids had food and, as I was walking up to order, started the truck and left. We have a whole sales force to feed.... Wasn't here for 5min. What's up with that?"}
{"text":"This place does breakfast and lunch stops at my work.... With everybody saying they have good breakfast burritos I decided to go give one a try. $4 for a veggie and egg burrito that weighs 200 pounds and is the size of a truck. (slight over exaggerating) But still... it's big. It is good to the taste too, tho not absolutely to die for amazing. I mean I've had better breakfast burritos but it is good. They are pretty nice people.... and there is a 50 cent charge for card. Maybe I'll try lunch sometime... they specialize in Mexican food but they also do have burgers and wraps on the menu."}
{"text":"You know you've seen them as you drive by construction sites...it's the snack shack, the roach coach,  it's Ralph's Snack Bar!! 

Ok, so I was a little skeptical when HR sent out an email that Ralph's would start doing daily runs to my building, but I they gave me 2 free Ralph Bucks to spend and I couldn't resist, being the cheapskate that I am. Honestly, we were all waiting to see who ran to the toilet first, but everyone was fine and had really good things to say about the food.

Can someone say yum! My food was awesome with the exception that it was a little salty for me. I got a rice pudding cup and the rolled taco special with rice and beans (it's only $3.50!) and it was really tasty! They also sell Mexican cokes (think the real sugar stuff - no corn syrup here) and all sorts of little snacky treats.

Hit up my parking lot at lunchtime (40th St. & Broadway) if you ever need a Ralph's fix."}
{"text":"My new office by Deer Valley Airport and the food truck drove by for 3 days before I went in for a try.

Pretty darn good.
Had 2 steak tacos (street style) that were very good.  One chicken taco that was tasty, just not really my style.  Will try the pork next.

They have several really great salsas.
Will be eating here a lot!"}
