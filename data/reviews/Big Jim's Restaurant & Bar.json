{"text":"Bring an appetite - or a couple of friends to help you finish. Seriously, if you leave here hungry, you've done something wrong. It's good food - and lots of it.  I can appreciate healthy living, and healthy eating - but next time you want to be good to yourself, come here and get the roast beef sandwich with fries and gravy.  It ain't Lawrenceville and they ain't trying to be. They're comfortable with who they are. And although I probably wouldn't abide by the 5 second rule here, I got no hangups about coming back."}
{"text":"I saw Big Jim's on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Went there when in Pittsburgh with my son visiting Pitt, had a great lunch.  My son went to Pitt and I have been back several times. The food is very good, large servings and reasonably priced. This place will surprise you. It is off the beaten path. You have to be looking for it because it is below the highway in a neighborhood that leads nowhere to my knowledge. It is unattractive at best but the service is good, food is very good, fresh, plentiful and very reasonable. If you like good food, funky places and you are not a snob stop in and give it a try."}
{"text":"Big Jim's was the first place I hit up on my cross-country trip from Philly to L.A., so I was expecting delicious, gut busting, bad-for-you food in large quantities, and that's what I got :)  I ordered the lasagna. Someone on Yelp said it was big as a head - yeah, they weren't kidding. This lasagna was huge and boy was it good. I give it a 4 out of 5, although I'm not sure if they could do much more to improve it - I think they should add another type of cheese to the top to make it a tad more flavorful, but that's my take.  My husband got the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were not as big as I expected, but their slightly spicy flavor was really awesome. The pasta and garlic bread were just right too.   All right so the food has me around 5 stars, but why the 4? Well, I could handle being in a shady part of town and the overall dark, dreary character of the place, cause as Guy said on Triple D it's a Dive - fine. But at these type of places I expect really good service from friendly people. Well, we had 2 servers - one was friendly but really difficult to get over to the table and the other was less likely to come around without being harassed and also seemed annoyed with everyone there.  For the out-of-towners deciding between Big Jim's and something like Primanti Bros, go with Big Jim's - seriously."}
{"text":"We saw this place on the tv show Diners Drive-ins and Dives and had to try it. The place is certainly a dive in terms of the decor, but when you taste the food it doesn't matter one bit. It's actually kind of refreshing that this place stands solely on it's food. We had the wedding soup which was phenomenal. It was filled with delicious meatballs, pieces of chicken and had a great flavor! We also had a pizza and split an order of meatballs. The meatballs and the marinara that they came in were quite tasty, and left us wanting more. While the pizza was very good, we wished we had ordered some pasta after admiring our neighbor's choices. We will definitely return for another tasting session sometime soon. The wait staff was efficient but not overly friendly. They were spread a bit thin and seemed to have a way of doing things that didn't always put the customer's needs first. But, again, the food stands on it's own, and if that's what you are going there for, then you will certainly not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Saw it on DDD.  It was awesome.  Reuben sandwich was great.  My friends had a fish sandwich and a 2 bill sandwich and they  loved theirs.  When I get back to Pittsburgh will definitely eat there again.  Worth the trip.  Once again, its AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre....saw the place on triple D and wanted to try it. Wedding soup was good, chicken parm was huge but not particularly outstanding. Tomato sauce had a strange taste to it. Place is a real dump but has character"}
{"text":"You don't come here for the service or to be treated like a princess. You come here for the food. Delicious, large servings at a reasonable price. Big Jim's is down to earth and a gritty Pittsburgh restaurant located in the lower Greenfield AKA \"The Run\". Come hungry, leave full. This place is as Pittsburgh as it gets."}
{"text":"Like many others reviewing Big Jim's, I was inspired to try it after seeing the Diner's Drive-Ins and Dives episode in which it was featured. Based on what I saw on the show, and what I had read on Yelp, I knew to expect huge portions and the \"homey\" (to put it nicely) decor. Indeed, it was decorated like a suburban grandparents basement, but it actually was kind of charming.  I went with my husband and a friend one Friday night a few weeks ago. We got there around 7pm and it was crowded but we did not have to wait for a table. Unlike many reviewers here, our service was definitely not slow; a waitress was almost immediately at the table to take drink orders (before we all got a chance to look through the menu) and made herself available throughout the meal, frequently checking in with us.   I really wanted to try the meatballs, which had been showcased on DDD. I ordered two as an appetizer (husband and friend ordered jalapeno poppers, of which I am not a fan and did not try. They claimed they were tasty). The meatballs were quite delicious and so was the accompanying sauce. I could tell both were homemade, and enjoyed the sauce so much that even when I had finished the meat, I scraped up the rest of the sauce with my fork to finish it all.   For dinner I ordered a hot sausage calzone. The waitress told me that it would take about 30 minutes to cook, and since we ordered apps I didn't care. Again, I knew from watching DDD that the portion would be ridiculous, and it was: it was as if someone took a large pizza and folded it in half. It really was that big. But, I can say this as a hard-core foodie and a self-labeled gourmand, it was the best damn calzone I have ever eaten. Hands down; no contest. The dough was thin and crisp and perfectly, uniformly browned. In general, my critique about calzones is that there is often way too much cheese (I am not a fan of tons and tons of cheese), but this calzone had the proporations down perfectly: fresh delicious fillings of sausage, peppers and onions, and a smattering of cheese to tie it all together. The sausage was indeed spicy, sliced thinly and bursting with flavor. The onion and peppers appeared to have been roasted first, then thinly sliced, which also added an unexpected dimension of flavor.  A winner. And we had enough calzone left over to eat throughout the rest of the weekend.   My husband ordered a reuben sandwich which he said was really good, and our friend ordered the immense veal parm sandwich which she described as delicious.   I will definitely go back to Big Jim's. I want to try other things on the menu but I am already craving that calzone again.   Seriously: this place is worth the trip and I can now see why people rave about it. I am only giving it four stars because of the decor. Yes: I get it, you're homey and dive-y and unpretentious, yadda yadda, but if someone spent 2 hours sprucing the interior of that place up, it would make a huge difference."}
{"text":"What you see is what you get. A dive serving mediocre food in large portions. The wedding soup was ok but a tad salty. The pasta dishes were decent but was a little bland. Good red sauce and respectable meatballs. The veal parm sandwich was epic huge but also a little bland. The staff were very friendly. Not a bad stop, but not a DDD winner."}
{"text":"Take a step back with me:   The year, circa 1985. When the family Chevy wagon heads out on a Saturday afternoon jaunt from the Pittsburgh suburbs with all 5 kids in tow, we all know that, while the zoo/museum/ballgame is going to be fun, the highlight is going to be the dinner stop at Big Jim's. After which the overloaded sky-blue Impala (with its overloaded occupants), will lumber back onto the parkway east, stuffed and homeward bound... Yeah, my old man was thrifty (5 kids will do that to you), this was about all of the dining out we ever did as a family. But he certainly had taste!   I can proudly say I have been enjoying Big Jim's for more than 20 of my 30 years... as good now as it was then (or better, as I can now share in the pitchers).   I'm glad to see that the other Yelp reviews here treat it as it should be treated, not as haute cuisine (some other online reviews questioned the cleanliness of the bathrooms, which appear to have been last sanitized shortly before I started going there. This was also the last time the condom dispenser was replenished, judging by the written descriptions), but as what it truly is: your yinzer cousin's woodgrained-laminate basement rec-room, only with fantastic, gigantic portions of Pittsburgh comfort food, served by friendly folks...    If you simply want your mind boggled at shear food quantity, go with one of the calzones every time. The \"Big Jim\" named for the now-deceased founder (I have seen this man, he was indeed not small), has a small deli-case worth of cured meats inside, and is served hanging over the edges of a large pizza tray. I myself am not a small man, and this dish constitutes three solid meals for me.   Believe it or not, this place used to be even cheaper, the above calzone now runs the better part of 10 dollars... What can I say, I'm nearly as cheap as Dad, though it's still worth every penny.   Also, reservations are accepted for very large parties (6 or more, I think). I had to suffer through the DD role for a bachelor's party on my most recent visit, Big Jim's without beer was kinda like delicious purgatory. Though the service was, as ever, fantastic, without being the least overbearing: After it became clear I was drinking pop, a tiny, halfsize pitcher appeared next to my glass. Needless to say, many humorous \"giant calzone siting\" photos were snapped next to my mini pitcher with available cellphones...   Can't recommend it enough, one visit will make you a believer. This is the kind of place that brought me back to Pittsburgh after early-20s wanderings. Though the men's toilet is, like all good bars, not for the faint of heart!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and like it --- it's comfortable in a yinzer way. The walls have dark paneling, the food is unpretentious, the portions are huge, the bill is low - and the service is pleasant but not overly chatty/fake.    My favorites on the menu are chicken parm and pizza. The chicken parm is huge (2-3 meals on a plate, basically). The chicken isn't pounded too thin, which is key because they do put a decent amount of \"crust\" on the chicken (which I happen to like because mmm FRIED BATTER) and the pasta isn't overcooked. Pizza isn't thin crust -- but it's not pan thick either. I love it for that reason. It holds up to the tons of cheese (that actually melts into goo without being a gummy mess). The pasta and pizza sauces are good -- on the sweeter side, but not overly so. Husband likes the turkey club - it has a ton of thick sliced turkey breast.   I'm mainly taking a star off because I don't like their fries, which are homemade shoe string. I am kind of picky when it comes to fries -- so, maybe I am being too critical. I just found them to be kind of mushy and weak. Maybe I just got a bad batch? I dunno, after having them once, I never ordered them again.   The neighborhood is just fine. Unless working class neighborhoods and urban infrastructure scares you. I think it reads as sketchy  to some people because it's tiny, nothing is fancy, and the businesses aren't all clustered together. The Run looks like a small working class town."}
{"text":"Went to visit U of Pittsburgh with the college bound son. Have to always go to a triple D spot when I can. Out of the way, hard to find , at night. Parked in front of the neighbors house and only had to walk across the street which was great.i took a minute for safety as there were a few people out front and I wasn't sure at first glance which door to use to go inside.  Inside to the left is a dinning room that we walked into. The room was soooo Very musty smelling that it was on the border of pull your shirt up to your nose to breath. Before we sat I checked the bar side and it was better. Not good but much better. The waitress was as nice as the tables were sticky. If you walked in this place with nobody around ,you would think it was abandoned for a few months. There is nothing wrong with being a Dive, but some Windex and a towel would go a long way.i could only imagine what there homes look like. Anyway we decided to stay. Good enough for Guy good enough for us. Hot open roast beef,fries, gravy was good. Lots lots of gravy on everything. I wish the beef wasn't sooo very well done but it all tasted like the gravy anyway. I would give it a 7.  My son got the Reuben sandwich. He was not happy. He pulled a big chunk of fat/cartilage / something ,out of his mouth and lost interest after that. He picked at half and was not a fan of the sauerkraut. I tried it and it tasted spoiled. We took the other half to go and left it in our fridge in the hotel when we checked out of the hotel  I said thank you to our waitress and left her a 25% tip because she was nice. If my son chooses this school I would never return .  Just to show its not all bad.we visited  Fuel and Fuddle near the college the next day for lunch. 10 out of 10. Really really good. ( and clean ,and lighted) unlike big jims."}
{"text":"Did not disappoint  the veal parm sandwich IS as big as your head and is enough for 3 meals. Is also delicious, the fresh cut fries with beef gravy were perfect! Our waitress was very pleasant and helpful well worth the visit"}
{"text":"This place is a tucked away little gem in the burgh. The atmosphere is... interesting, but the food is delicious. Their white pizza is the best (with tomatoes). Their Pittsburgh salads are humongous. If you haven't made the trek to this joint in the run, you definitely should. You may find yourself taking your friends their to show it off..."}
{"text":"A friend of mine saw this on Diners, Drive-In's & Dives, so we knew we had to try it.  It's a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, but it's a family favorite.  Don't come here if you're in a hurry, but the food is worth the wait.  Huge portions & fairly cheap."}
{"text":"I have loved eating here for the last 20 years since I moved back to Pittsburgh. Not a fancy place at all, nor is it particularly \"hip\", but the food is simple, well-prepared and delicious.  It is one of the great old-school neighborhood places that pretty much are true to our Pittsburgh roots.  Portion sizes are nuts, and the prices are reasonable.  Always worth the trek."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here because of it being on Triple D with Guy F. Truly a dive but the wedding soup was tasty. The fish and two-bill sandwiches we had were large and tasted fine, the fresh cut fries were good as well. The waitress was friendly. If in the area and are hungry stop, otherwise not really worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Every single time I come here I am never disappointed. Not only do you get what you pay for, plus more, it is really good food! The menu may seem like any other place with the items listed, but they bring something special to the table every time. The area is a little weird & parking isn't ideal, but with the service / food, I don't mind a bit!"}
{"text":"Came here because of their appearance on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Had the spaghetti and meatballs, I was quite disappointed. The Old Fashioned Spaghetti Factory chain is better."}
{"text":"My wife and I are Triple D junkies so we try to find places wherever we travel that Guy has been to.  Last night we tried Big Jim's. She had the Chicken Parm sandwich and I had the Gnocchi. Both were fabulous. Obviously, the sandwich was way to big for one sitting snowed took the rest for a late night snack."}
{"text":"I love Big Jim's. It's honestly my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh. The portions are huge, the food is delicious and the price is good! I've had the lasagna several times and it has never disappointed. Seriously  the portion is huge! The servers are always friendly and attentive, I've never had a bad experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just had to update this to say that Big Jim's is now smoke free!"}
{"text":"Saw Big Jims on Diners Drive ins and Dives and after reading the yelp reviews had to try it. I walked in was surprised by how crowded it was on a sunday especially in its location ( not off a busy highway and if you weren't looking for it most likely wouldn't just stumble upon it) I ordered a veal parm sandwich which i heard was the speciality. Bread was a nice italian loaf and was perfect for this sandwich. Sauce was really good, not that much cheese on the sandwich, which i like. The veal was breaded really well not to thick and chunky but rather nice and light. They give you tons of veal on the sandwich. Overall, I really liked the sandwich and it was huge and good BUT there was deff. something missing. There wasn't a hug WOW  to it... but it was really good. just didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"My review is based strictly on the rueben and/or two-bill sandwiches. Hands down the best in the city, and yes I've been to Szmidt's.   It's the go to spot for my g/f's family to celebrate birthday's, and I'm looking forward to another sandwich tomorrow night for that very reason.   Yes it's a dive, but it's comfortable, and I appreciate a place that doesn't take it self too seriously."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service.  Old school bar and grill with fantastic, huge portions.  I ordered a half sandwich and struggled to eat it all!  Chicken Parmegian sandwich was fantastic.  I look forward to coming back and trying out their huge selection of beer."}
{"text":"Love their calzones and eggplant parm. The staff is always nice an friendly. Great place to grab and beer and watch the game.  Not the fanciest place in the burgh but they don't pretend to be either. Just a good old fashioned Pgh bar with great food and nice people."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Small, friendly, super cheap and super big portions. The appetizer eggplant is large enough to serve as a meal, with some left over for tomorrow's lunch."}
{"text":"I was going to complain about the fact that no one answered the phone when I called to place a take-out order--nor did they call me back within 30 minutes; or when I got there and realized there were 11 tables (only 3 filled) and 4 waitresses--all huddled together giggling at something; or when I asked for a glass of wine while I waited for my take-out order and she said \"it really won't take them long\" ,,,but then I got back to my condo (in the Village--a five minute walk in a now thunderstorm) and tasted my delicious BBQ sandwich with baked beans and I forgot everything that was wrong. Maybe it was the wine."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 25 years now,  my late mother's favorite restaurant.  Service is amazing,  and the portions are huge! Love the roast beef sandwich and the chicken hoagie.  Gotta try the veal sandwich one of these days!"}
{"text":"Our typical pre baseball ballgame stop...good food, good service, good prices! Their sandwiches are excellent, portions good and drink prices fair. Off the beaten path a bit but, well worth the venture."}
{"text":"Was visiting Pitt a while back and everyone said Big Jims was the place to eat. They couldnt have been more right. Big Jims is a place you wouldnt even notice as a restaurant on the outside and I cant even recall any businesses surrounding it. The food is where this place really shines.  I settled on the Veal Parmesan and couldnt believe my eyes when it came to the table, the veal was bigger than my platter!  I couldnt even finish my meal and ended up taking half of it home, great value for the money.     They also make homemade wedding soup thats outta this world!    We woulda dined at Big Jim's our entire time in Pitt but Diners Drive Inn's and Dives happened to be filming while we were there and we couldnt get near the place again, bummer!"}
{"text":"Ah yes...Big Jim's. I have been eating here since the early 80s when my Mom worked there. My first memory of video games comes from Big Jim's. I was sitting on someone's lap playing a table top version of Q-Bert. Those were the days.  This place is just a hole in the wall. But its a great one. No matter what you get off the menu, its tasty. This time, we got the open-faced roast beef sandwich, the open-faced turkey sandwich, a small cheese pizza and a chicken parm sandwich.  The two open-faced sandwiches are awesome. Big piles of meat and gravy on top of hearty chunks of Italian bread and thin-cut homemade fries. The turkey was real sliced turkey from a turkey breast. The roast beef is fresh sliced, too.  The pizza is always good. The really pile on the cheese. Unfortunately today, they piled the sauce on, too. There was literally enough sauce to scoop off the pizza and eat with a fork. Which I did, because their sauce is almost as good as my own. Still though...all that sauce is not needed.  The chicken parm was okay. It was a large chicken cutlet but it wasn't very crispy. The bread was good and just like the pizza, the cheese was piled high on this hoagie.  Other than the overly saucy pizza the only real complaint was the waitress wasn't very friendly. This is atypical of the place and this is the first time I can recall having a crabapple for a server here.  I don't like to base my reviews on previous visits, and I won't. But I well touch base on some of the other menu items that are top notch. Their pasta is always good. They really do have a good sauce. I'm not the kind of person who likes ordering pasta in restaurants because its never as good as my own (or my father's). But Big Jim's is the sort of place I can break my rules over.  They have these fried eggplant appetizers. They're awesome. Skip the parmesan version and just get them with marinara on the side.  The salads are always huge. Just make sure you tell them you don't need any french fries on them...Big Jim's, just like many other restaurants in this city, likes to muck up a perfectly good salad by dumping fries all over them. They have a homemade Italian dressing that is truly delicious. We've commented time and time again how we wish we could buy it by the bottle and take it home with us.  All the meat on their sandwiches is the real deal. Actual sliced roast beef and turkey. I don't know where they get their cold cuts from, but they're not cheap....they're quite good. The bread's great, as well. Crispy and flaky on the outside, soft and hearty on the inside.  Like I said...pretty much everything on the menu is good. We've tried a little bit of everything on the menu and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. No questions about it. The food is always so delicious and the portions are massive. I'm a big fan of the fettuccine alfredo. The alfredo sauce is so creamy and buttery. It's better than most straight italian places in Pittsburgh. But don't be fooled this is not just an italian menu. The menu has so many different options to cater to whatever you might be craving on a particular evening. And it's all priced so incredibly reasonable. Great if you've got a couple of hungry kids you're trying to feed without breaking the bank.  And, the beer selection is pretty extensive. They've recently added a huge beer list to the bar that will satisfy everyone from the light beer lovers to the craft beer connoisseurs. Again, without breaking the bank. It really is the perfect place to spend a night out without spending your whole paycheck.   The staff is always so friendly, kind and attentive. Even if they're slammed and it takes a minute for them to serve you, they make a point to come over and let you know they're not ignoring you and will be over ASAP. It's always a treat to spend an evening at Big Jim's. Give it the highest recommendation."}
{"text":"This is the best valued restaurant I have been to in terms of portions and quality. While their veal parm dinner and sandwiches are fantastic, I tried their amped Reuben that had loads of corned beef, creamy cole slaw, a fried egg, and thousand island on marble rye. It was delicious. My only gripe is chips at minimum could be offered or even fries at a dollar or two up charge. The restaurant years back also practically shut the restaurant room down on a days notice for us to have my mother's funeral dinner there (it was her favorite restaurant throughout her years). They were efficient, friendly, and attentive while we ordered ahead for 30-35 people (pizza, Strombolis, pasta dinners, sides, etc). It was still all ready shortly after our arrival."}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars I would...absolutely delicious,  friendly, welcoming, fantastic dinner.  On advice of regulars, we had fried zucchini appetizer - fantastic.   We split chicken parm and still took half of it home.  The chicken was very tender and seasoned well, the homemade sauce was perfect.  I couldn't say enough about this place...it's a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken and veal parmigiana. The portions are big and I liked the sauce. My wife thought the sauce was OK but wasn't crazy about the ground sausage in the sauce. It did throw the flavor of my veal parm of a bit but I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Um... Am I the only one who is going to say that they had problems with this place???? I didn't get this place at all!!!! Bill and i saw this joint on Triple D with Guy Fieri , and we had to experience it for ourselves. Thats where the problem began. First off, we Had to wait in line at a dive bar in a shady part of town for 30 minutes!!!! Then,  when we finally were seated, we noticed that the dish washer from the back was taking our drink order, (which took forever to get back to us!!! Doesnt anyone know what pete's wicked ale is???? MORONS!!!!) Dont even get me started on the food, which took a over an hour to make and get to our table. The wedding soup was a joke!!! too salty, Ive had better... I dont know... If you like to wait around for your food, then this is the place for you, ( they do have take out, i dont know how long that would take to make though....)  So basically, We spent over 2 hours in this place in which this is time we will never get back. Btw, thanks for wasting our time.... we know better now"}
{"text":"If you follow me on the rest of my social media (HITTofMCM) then you've been waiting for this review.  I know that you come to Yelp to find out about the actual product, the Food, and I'll get to that, but Big Jims isn't just about the food no matter how good it is, it's about what this place stands for.  Living in Pittsburgh my whole life I can't believe I've never been.  The building has been in the GreenField Run since the early 1900's but the restaurant opened in 1977.  I've eaten at a lot of places, I've BEEN to a lot of places, but sitting in Big Jims waiting for my food I couldn't help but feel at home, even a bit emotional from the love oozing from this place.    I sat at the bar and had the pleasure of having a gentlemen by the name of Scott serve me my Bahama Mama.  He started there in 1997 and said he could never see himself working for anyone else even before they appeared on the famous food show DINERS, DRIVE INS AND DIVES.  He asked me about myself and what I do and I told him about IM SO BURGH and other things all while he tended to everyone who was there and everyone who came in as if they were all one big family.  He knew everyone by name, he knew what some people wanted before they ordered it and he and all the staff operated in a way that wasn't overly friendly and fake but, honest a bit exhausted from life and always with a smile just like it would be at home after a long day.  I told him all my Facebook family encouraged me to come here after I posted how I wanted the best Reuben Sandwich I could find in the city of Pittsburgh.  While I waited for the food he pointed out they are going through a bit of a revitalization getting new carpet put in, painting tiles and changing walls as if it was renovations in his own home.  He pointed out photos of before they were open and a big portrait of Big Jim himself looking all Tony Soprano.  He appeared to be a man who got respect and gave it just the same.  If I based this review alone on my experience and atmosphere it would get 5 stars but then my food came and as I write this, I wish Yelp had a 6 star system.  My Reuben entered my place at the bar like a prize winning champion.  The Rye bread was toasted just enough to give it that crisp texture but not too much.  The sauerkraut and Swiss was just right and the thousand island dressing was just enough to marinate and flavor but the star of any Reuben is the meat and this didn't disappoint.  Thinly shaved, grilled just right with not a moment of chewiness or toughness it melted in your mouth all the way to the last bite.  Everything on the sandwich played its role like a team of ingredients should, and just in case I liked a little more Thousand Island, without even asking Scott made sure I had it right by my plate.  Each bite made me a little bit more sad because I knew it was coming to an end.  Like a night out with good friends that you wish lasted forever, that's how I felt about my closing time with this Reuben, Scott and Big Jims as a whole.  I'll be back.  I promised them that. Once to take my woman to dinner and a third time to spread the word with friends.  The fourth time though, I'll need another solo visit to recapture that first visit feel all over again.  If you're from Pittsburgh or just visiting skip the chain places and head to Big Jims, they have something for everyone."}
{"text":"Like most here us Canadian boys found out about Big Jim's on Diners, Drive In's and Dives and have been here a few times over the years. It's all it is cracked up to be... an awesome little dive bar and restaurant tucked away in a neighborhood that you would never find if not for the power of the Food Network.  The sandwiches are massive and delicious (I had gone with the veal parm both times in the past, opted for the chicken parm hoagie this time and wasn't disappointed), the fries are cut and cooked fresh, the place reeks of history, the staff is awesome and the beer is cold. What else does a guy need?"}
{"text":"You feel at home when you enter this restaurant. Stained green carpet and large portions reminds you of dinner at grandmas.   My first time at Jim's was on a freezing Pittsburgh night. As I walked into this famed restaurant I was met with the specials scrawled on a chalkboard. After being quickly seated I ordered a bowl of Chicken and Dumplings and it was hot and delicious. After that, I ordered the fries with gravy and the veal parmigiana sandwich. The sandwich was huge (big enough that two grown men shared it as a meal) and the fries were crispy with a delicious brown gravy.  Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal, the atmosphere and the people at Big Jim's!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 11, including 3 kids.  I had seen this featured on food networks DDD with guy fieri, and combined with a strong yelp rating, figured this was worth a stop.  We had an afternoon game at consol energy center so this place was 8 minutes from the arena.  The portions are beyond enormous--is there a word for that?  Our tale had Stromboli, which could have fed 3.  Kids had the children's pasta which was way too much for any kid, but ok.  I had he meatball sub half size, which was fine.  Pizza was quite good too.  I think everyone was very satisfied, and filled, by their meal.  Prices are very reasonable.  The service was good.  I had read, and heard, that service was either a nightmare or good.  We lucked out as our server was very attentive and happy to split our group into 3 checks.  We got there at 430 on a Saturday, I had called the day before since we were a large group.  Not many tables full at 430, but by 530 there was a wait at the door.  Great stop!"}
{"text":"After having a HORRIBLE experience at DE Nunzio's on Saturday (July 8 2017) my wife reminded me of Big Jims for Sunday dinner with the family. I hadn't been here in 2 years but was hoping it was as good as the first time we came. Big Jim's didn't disappoint. I had a Reuben sandwich that was delicious, all the house salads for the dinners were fresh and delicious, and all my families meals ( 2 eggplant parm dinners, Italian hero, eggplant parm app for dinner and a chef salad ) were all fresh and DELICIOUS. Bring your appetite for this place because the portions are ENORMOUS. The waitress Natalie was a doll as well. The prices were very reasonable as well. Everybody LOVED IT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing... very friendly and also very helpful. I sat at the bar and Scott was who waited on me. Again, great service.  I had the veal parm sandwich and wanted to also try the meatballs. The veal parm sandwich was nothing short of fantastic, and the meatballs were a little piece of heaven! Soft meatballs, not the hard frozen kind, and a great recipe. Sauce is also worth noting because that was awesome as well. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to some Big Jim's! Thank me later fellow yelpers..."}
{"text":"sheer joy being an Italian woman and find a place with decent wedding soup & lovely entrees and sandwiches..."}
{"text":"Everything is pretty good but the Veal Parmesan sandwich on a loaf of Italian bread is something you gotta try!"}
{"text":"My favorite greasy spoon in the burgh. Portions are large, the meatball sandwich is the bomb. Burgers are great and the pizza is homemade tasty. They carry a fine selection of bottled beer, domestic and imported. If you're hungry this is the place to go.  Down to earth dining!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed by eggplant parmagian. Had no flavor and barely any sauce or cheese, looked really good until biting in.  Atmosphere was terrible too, would not have minded if the food was great though."}
{"text":"We came. We ate. It was good but not the best I've had. Not a complaint just an opinion."}
{"text":"Portions are exceptional. Service was great and personal and very accommodating. Really enjoyed our time. Food was as seen on TV. The Veal Parmesan was a very generous portion. I would recommend not getting the side of spaghetti with it but one of the alternative options as one can only eat so much."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My fiancé and I were on the way home from Ohio. We saw the sign for Pittsburgh and decided to just take a detour. I found this place on the mytvfoodmaps app and saw it was featured on diners, driveins and dives. It's definitely in the dive category but the food is amazing. Its also not in a very commercial place so finding it might be a little hard. We ordered the wing dings to start. They're breaded fried wings. Came out quick hot so you know its fresh. My fiance ordered the open roast beef sandwich. Its topped with gravy and fries. I tried a little bit and I was really good. I ordered half a meatball hoagie. Even for a half a hoagie it was huge. My sandwich was really good too. Our total bill was $25 and we left full and comatosed. If you're in the area and want a laid back place this is definitely a place to try. The food was awesome and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service from the staff.  Good prices and large portions.  Food was great....best Reuben I've ever had.  Buffalo wings were good as well as my fries.  Nothing was greasy or bland."}
{"text":"Would have liked to give this place a 3  1/2, but it isn't a 4. The portions are huge. I recommend splitting dishes. The Veal Parm was 2 BIG veal cutlets. The service was good and the food is mediocre. It's dark inside and I wouldn't go for ambience. The restaurant itself is in a rougher area of town."}
{"text":"Expectations met! Large portions of traditional Italian food that Pittsburghers love. You'll go home with 2 extra meals per plate. Chicken, eggplant, or veal parm are pleasers. Hoagies are large, gnocchi is delicious, and pizza cheese is excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place. You have to come with an appetite. This place doesn't look like much and even when you go you expect much but omg it's amazing. The portions are huge."}
{"text":"My sister told me about this place while we were driving around exploring Pittsburgh. Obviously it was because of DD&D.So finding the place was kind of hard since I didnt know the roads that well. Once getting here I have to agree that it looks like its in a weird place or at least an old town of the area. Park in the back and go in. Nice interior, very homely feel, and they were showing the world cup which is always nice. So because I've never been here we decide to order a bundle. We order the lasagna, the buffalo chicken wings (full), a reuben sandwich, and onion rings. The lady was nice and friendly brought out some waters for my sis, cousin, and me. The wait was a while for the food but im sure everythings fresh and not just sitting there waiting. The wings looked nice, the reuben was big portioned, and my lasagna was out of this world in size. Just looking at it almost gave me acid reflux lol.  The food was good nonetheless. The truth is I would probably give this place 4 stars but I wasnt too impressed with the taste. The portions were huge, the prices were great, but I just felt something was missing from the taste. Dont get me wrong, this place would be a massive frequent if i lived in the area because of the menu and prices, but from my visit, i would give it 3.5 stars. Once i go back and try some other dishes I would gladly revise my rating."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Jim's in about 5 years and I must say their food is still the bomb. I had a fish sandwich with fries and cole slaw and Everything was phenomenal. Do you hear me? And I'm not exaggerating. The next time I come thru I'm getting the Big Fish Sandwich. Even the customer service at the bar was great I came thru for lunch. It's kinda uncomfortable sitting at the bar to eat your food the way the bar is designed, so your food isn't in a great position for you to eat so you might wanna sit at a table instead."}
{"text":"I love the calzones and that seems to be the best thing on the menu. The spicy meat  Calzone might be the best folded pizza I've ever had. Portions are Huge.  WE did see a pasta being ordered once- HUGE HUGE HUGE.    The only other thing worth a visit for is the new breakfast. It is a grease heaven.  The potatoes are kicking but huge in number. Pancakes put the word cake back in the equation. It feels really good after a drinking night and I recommend it.   But go for the calzones. They are HUGE- imagine large pizza folded for maybe 8 bucks or something amazing.  Feeds 3-4 EASILY.  I barely barely can eat a fourth, and i love my food (know what I mean).  Owners really nice to.  Overall, solid Greenfield place."}
{"text":"Honestly, not sure what all the hype is about. Ordered chicken parm and the french dip. French dip was awful--dry meat and the broth it comes with was disgusting. The chicken parm was average, nothing to write home about. Huge portion though, so if that's what you're looking for, this is the place. Otherwise, there are a million better places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Being from New York, I have been to my fair share of dives, dumps and greasy spoons. Being that I was in the Pittsburgh area, I figured I'd give this hole-in-the-wall a try, especially since Guy Fieri recommended it (although I am starting to doubt his taste because, frankly, all his suggestions have blown thus far).   We get here and it's confusing from the start. The guy from the back (does he cook the food? wash the dishes?) seats us in the dark bar area. He asks us what we want to drink and tells someone to get us Diet Pepsi (we ordered regular Pepsi). We get the menus and I was tempted to get out a flashlight just to read it.   In the meantime, a waitress comes over and asks us what we want to drink. We tell her Pepsi. She walks off. Someone else comes over and puts down two Pepsi glasses. Then she walks over with two more. Looks like there is no communication here - or light fixtures.  Looking at the expansive menu, we decide to check Yelp on our phones for other reviewer's suggestions before ordering. We've done it before and it's worked. Unfortunately, this gets us a rude comment from a guy who is now our server (yep, we have now had three people \"serve\" us). He snaps at us, asking if we're texting or if we're ready. Well, excuse me, Mr. Sassy Pants. I was actually looking for what to order in this dump, if you don't mind. Not wanting to ruin what is supposed to be a fun experience, we politely order our meals. I get the chicken sandwich, he gets the roast beef au jus.  A whole HALF HOUR later, our magical sandwich creations come out from the kitchen. One look at these things, and you'd ask yourself, What the hell took so damn long? My sandwich was the most uninspired thing I've seen in a long time. It was a big slab of chicken breast thrown in between a hamburger bun, with an un-melted slice of American cheese, uncooked green peppers and a spoonful of grilled onions. Half of it tasted like chicken -- the other half tasted burnt and like an old oven. His sandwich was no better - but it came with burnt, hard and cold french fries that a dog would sneer its nose at.   Needless to say, the food was terrible. I don't care about the \"large portions\" and \"everything is made on the premises\" bullsh** - this food is barely edible. Like I said, I get that this place has \"character\" and it's dirty on purpose which adds to its charm but I'm sorry, you aren't winning me over on that load of horse apples. Take your character and shove it where the sun don't shine - which just so happens to be the dark dining room at Big Jim's."}
{"text":"Great staff, terrific food, huge portions! That's what keeps my family regulars! This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"As good as all the reviews...  we didn't feel like cooking last night and decided to try Big Jims to go for the first time.  Why did we wait so long...???  We ordered a whole chic parm, a whole cheese steak and an order of fried zucchini.  It took a little longer than the half hour I was told but the food was worth the wait.  The chic parm was 2 full fried chic breasts covered w sauce & cheese and the steak was restaurant grade shaved sirloin.  $11 each and well worth it.  The place isn't fancy, it's not 'dicey', it's not romantic... it's a bar with really good bar food.  Try it and you will love it..."}
{"text":"Great place for families and Italian food. Featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, this place really does have sandwiches as.big as your head. It's crazy. Great hometown service. Small place. Get there early or be willing to wait. But trust me, it's worth the wait. Great chicken parm, fried zucchini, HUGE sandwiches and the calzones are as big as a small child. Am not kidding. Worth the weight, I mean wait. Great place. Loved every minute."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I woke up with a Sunday hangover around 11 am and wanted hot cheap comfort food brunch. We came across Big Jim's on yelp and immediately decided to go. So Big Jim's isn't in the sort of place where'd you think you would find an amazing dive bar and restaurant with amazing food, but it is so good! The sketchy location and outside appearance add to the experience of going here. The inside of the restaurant is very clean while still giving the Pittsburgh dive bar feel. We got water and, of course, coffee right away. The coffee comes in basically a soup bowl mug which I thought was the perfect size and really charming. I ordered the hot open faced turkey sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the Rueben sandwich. They both came extremely fast and were SO HUGE. No joke, these entrees are so large and well worth the price around $10. We both had at least half of our meals for leftovers to take home. The food was delicious and exactly what we needed. We were so pleased that we went back the same week for dinner and drinks! This place is so classic Pittsburgh for cheap huge amounts of food and good brews. Highly recommend and we will be back on the reg!"}
{"text":"Saw it featured on DDD Food Network with Joe Fiery.  So while in town to a visit to MCU, I decided to check it out..  Went early Sunday afternoon with two friends. They didn't know where we were going. So, our Uber driver took us there to a non description brick building next to railroad tracks and under a rusting bridge.... We where a little nervous, but soon as we were stumbling out of our UberCar, a heavyset lady, runs out of the place and starts yelling at her husband to put on his big boy pants..  \"It's not a biker bar and... No bikers don't like to ride at 20 degrees when it's snowing.. I saw a DDD sticker on the door and knew we were in the right place. Not too many people in the joint, people checked us out more than us checking them out... Us because we actually dressed in dressy casual and the were dressed casual dressy. Sit wherever you wasn't fellows... CE waiter comes gets us some Big Jim Brew.... And it was pretty good beer.... Big Jim is starting to grow on me. My two friends still didn't know what this place is.. I ordered three Big Jim Ales, and we all start enjoying. I ordered the Reuben Sandwich... It came with toasted pumpernickel bread a hefty portion of meat and the same for the sauerkraut. Best I've ever tasted, even comparing with Manhattan Delis.....  Great food, very friendly, clean, ...  If you are in Pittsburgh, stop by this place. You will not regret it.  Ernie"}
{"text":"I do not even know where to start.  I worked here when Big Jim and Joyce were here.  I do not live in Pittsburgh any more and only get back once every 3-4 years. First look it's still the same. But this place is DIRTY.  From the front cash register to the pictures in the back dining area.  Had the wedding soup that hasn't changed  flavorful more veggies and meat than broth as Jim and Joyce always liked it. Fried zucchini was really greasy and the marinara was In a plastic cup.  I know it's not fine dining but that was never done. Spaghetti and meat sauce. That was very watery but nicely cooked pasta. Garlic bread was hard as rocks but the watery sauce softened it up.  They need to shut down for a week and paint and clean.  Staff was just OK, not outstanding as has been in the past.  No pride in the work.  This hurts my heart it write this review. But the truth is the truth and it's time to face it."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look the best but food is excellent and the service is fantastic!  My husband always gets pizza or open face roast beef n gravy. I get lasagna (which gives me 3meals) or a sandwich. My granddaughter's love to go there. They get there own personal pizza which is huge. Big Jim's was also on \"Diners, Drive in and Dives\". Guy showed the spaghetti being made, he gave the recipe. Also, I forgot to mention they have the best wedding soup in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I saw this on triple D so I had to try it. The food is okay and the place is kinda a dive. Not the kind of place you'd want to bring a date. I would probably come back but there are plenty of other places in Pittsburgh that I prefer."}
{"text":"My friend said this place was on triple D and he wanted to try it so we ended up going.    Big Jim's in the Run is essentially right in the middle of a residential zone.  It doesn't really feel like you are walking into a business at first because of the area you drove through to get there.  You will most likely end up parking on the street in front of somebody's home nearby.  This place has what I call quintessential \"American Italian\".  What that means is that it's not necessarily Italian but rather Americanized Italian food which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's just not the same.    The first thing you will notice is that the decor is very simple.  This place is the last \"D\" in the title of the show, \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\".  This place is a dive and it's part of the charm of the place.  They are not trying to be anything outside of what they are besides themselves which is what makes this place genuine.    The servings at this place are really large in that one dish can maybe feed 2 people.  If each of your party orders a dish you will most likely not finish your meal.  The salads are huge, the bread comes to the table at first the entrees will fill you up big time.  The food at the same time is good as well.    The lasagna has A LOT of ricotta in it... almost too much.  The veal sandwich I ordered was almost the size of the plate!    All that being said it's not a lot of money for a lot of food.  While it's not the greatest Italian food I've had it's one of the better American Italian food places I've eaten at and I can't say you leave hungry because the portions are beyond generous to the point of being family sized.  The service was very welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Triple D heaven. Epitomizes dive joint. Awesome service and massive amounts of food for your money. Would eat here every day if I lived in Pittsburgh.  Definitely going back. Check out my food pics of meatball hoagie and open faced hot turkey sammich. Insanely good. Seriously, stop reading and go to Big Jim's."}
{"text":"Always a good place to take anyone. There is something on the menu for everyone. We have a friend from Italy; loves the Italian hoagies. I love the pizza, wings, salads. It is all good. The employees are incredibly nice. Everyone who walks in, usually has a smile on their face. It's a hometown favorite..that's for sure.  Prices are good. Selection cannot be beat. I think the only thing they don't have is sushi!!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give Big Jim's no stars. Worst hard crusted-over fried piece of dried out fish served with mushy, over-cooked mush fries.  It all went in the garbage. The one star is for the pickle.  Never, never more This is not the original Big Jim's."}
{"text":"Hard to find, but worth the effort. Try the DDD faves! The meatball sandwich is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I went here expecting the worst, and was pleasantly surprised - the place is funky. Expect huge portions of cheap, fairly good although on the greasy side... food. Bring your apetite! The calzone is big enough to feed four for dinner, easily. Salad was okay, and the salmon sandwich was better than expected (but not great). Next time I crave some hearty food, I'll probably come back and get a pizza or calzone."}
{"text":"We have been going to Big Jim's for at least 15 years! The food is fantastic and the service is always excellent! I highly recommend the rueben, chicken parmasan dinner, or the pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I ate the WHOLE calzone and didn't even get a t-shirt?!?  Really?  Not even a discount?!?  Seriously, my stomach hurts so bad right now, but I conquered the beast. The whole, delicious beast in all of its entirety.   This place is not a diner, not a drive-in...definitely a dive, but, man is it good!  Came with a business party of about twelve and the place accommodated us just fine and without hesitation.   Everyone loved their food, so I'll definitely be back...though next time for a MUCH smaller portion...or at least when I have portion-control.   Super delicious and a super dive!  Gotta' love places like this!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I wonder if there is a crowd surge at Big Jim's every time their episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives airs. My husband and I had watched the episode earlier in the week and were feeling Italian so we decided to make the short hike from South Side. I ordered a bowl of Wedding Soup and half of a meatball hoagie. He ordered the lasagna. The meatballs are good and the hoagie hit the spot, largely due to the bread and melted cheese. The wedding soup is delicious! Neither of us were impressed by the lasagna. There wasn't much flavor / seasoning aside from the sauce which is a little on the safe \"no indigestion afterwards\" side.  The portions are generous and the atmosphere is definitely divey with late 70's decor and a dedicated clientele of local regulars. I would say it's a great place for a sandwich, soup and a beer. I was eyeing up the jumbo wings someone at the bar ordered. I would definitely give Big Jim's another shot."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Went there this weekend and although hard to find, was totally worth it.  Food was enormous and delicious.  Prices were low and the wait staff was super friendly and very helpful.  We go to Pittsburgh a lot so we will def. go back."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing here.  Super friendly staff, huge portions, relaxed atmosphere and good prices. I have never had a bad meal or bad experience here. I suggest the Chicken and Meatball Parm dinners. Amazing. Their sandwiches and hoagies are also fantastic. You cant get a bad meal here and if you leave hungry, it's definitely your fault!"}
{"text":"Tony Vanoy , Noelle Teel and I was tired, hot and hungry after walking around the Pittsburgh Zoo for over 4 hrs in 80+ degree weather. I jumped on my smartphone and checked out my app for TV restaurants in Pittsburgh area and found \"Big Jim's Restaurant and Bar\" on Salina Street, so we GPS our way across town to dine where Guy ate on Triple D....Noelle went with the New York Strip with fries and Cole slaw, Tony ordered a steak hoagie and I  went with Spicy Sausage Hoagie...it was all very good...the building was dark and scary and in a bad part of the neighborhood. ..in fact I had to check my phone app again to make sure we were at the right place....it was definitely divey...in fact I was almost too nervous to take my daughter inside..the staff was friendly...food good and prices too high for my liking..."}
{"text":"I love Big Jim's! It's very cheap, the portions are massive, and the food (wedding soup, open faced turkey sandwich, and fish sandwich) is fantastic. The service is not fast or overly warm, but so what. Order another beer and enjoy your company and the great food."}
{"text":"So good and so much food you can't eat it all. But worth taking home to eat the next day. The servers are excellent. Ask for Scott!!!! He's the best."}
{"text":"o,m,g best sandwich i had in my life. i wish they made sandwich like this in los angeles"}
{"text":"Let me tell you this place is great. This was our first time and will now be our all of the time. I had the veal parm dinner it came with a salad and fries. The veal was huge full of cheese and yes i finished it only because i didn't eat the salad and fries. My husband had the lasagna that was also huge. He brought half of his home. He also had jalapeno poppers and cole slaw which he says they were good. My only complaint is that my long island ice tea was not made right. All bartenders should know how to make a good long island. The kids meal is as big as an adult dinner at other restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. If you ever need to fulfill that greasy food craving, which is always for me, this is the place to be! It has that dive bar/diner feel with a large banquet-ish room on the side for those classier folks. The portions are out of control and the flavor of the food isn't compromised. The first time here, I ordered the famous veal Parmesan sandwich which apparently Guy Fieri had on Diner's and Dives. It took me three days to eat it all and it was only 13 bucks! My wife ordered a sausage calzone that was the size of a toddler. The next time we went we had pizza and it was awesome as well. The customer service is always great and the people are very friendly. Definitely check out Big Jim's"}
{"text":"*walks in, sets down soapbox, steps upon soapbox, clears throat*  For all those people that kindly wrote a review on this place solely because you watched an episode of DDD, maybe you should have ordered exactly what was shown on the show and then left it at that.  If you are going to come here because of the show, then do exactly what they did on the show and leave it at that.  Don't bring down the whole place because what you ordered didn't look/taste like what was served on the show.  *steps down and removes the soapbox*  Now, since that is out of the way, let me move forward.  Yes, this place is a little offsetting with the way it looks.  It's a bit divey on the inside, well maybe more than a bit divey on the inside.  That is exactly what gives this place character.  It gives you the feel that you are in someones home from the 70s.  TVs are around the place, tacky pictures and mirrors line the walls, and the chairs are mismatched.  The servers kind of blend in a bit making it feel 70s more so.    The menu, even though it looks small, takes a bit to look over.  Be sure to look it over as well, you may pass up something that you really want.  I opted for the open face turkey sandwich with fries.  I was expecting to get a moderate amount of food as you do at other places, and I was fine by that.  What I got on the other hand surely surprised me.  When I saw the size of the plate, I was shocked.  It was the size of a small platter, and the whole thing was covered in food.  Two thick slices of bread, toasted and then topped with a heaping pile of turkey and then covered with gravy.  And the fries, oh my god, the fries.  They are fresh cut, on the smaller size, but still amazing.  The gravy also topped these.  It took me some time and determination, but I downed it all.  For two meals, it cost us under $20.  A meal of this caliber at any other place would definitely cost us more.  Big Jim's is definitely worth getting lost in Greenfield to find a good meal.  *Take out available with a fee."}
{"text":"Big portions.  If you don't eat a lot get the soup or half sandwich.  Best wedding soup in Pittsburgh, hands down!  Monday night is spaghetti night, a great value.   Friendly staff.  You can expect a wait on busy nights, but most are not.  Great takeout too.  If you get a full portion take some home for leftovers tomorrow.  Their Reuben is excellent and lasagna superb.  Great breakfast on the weekend.  Check it out on a Steeler Sunday.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of the best kept secret's in the Burgh. The food portions are ridiculous large, and the taste of the food is excellent. Try the egg plant Parmesan for an appetizer, can pretty much feel 2 to 4 people with leftovers. Scott the bartender is the absolute best with attention to every detail. youYou feel like you are the only customer there.  Highly recommend this place for families and out of town guests if you want to impress them with Pittsburgh tradition."}
{"text":"Well. Most of what I have to say has been said. It's in an odd area. While some people thought it was \"shady\", I really thought nothing of it. It's tucked under a bridge (overpass?) in a fairly residential area. Doesn't look like much from the outside. I went for lunch during a weekday. I was the only one in the place. The decor was pretty plain. Big long bar, some seating in there, and then another room of seating as well.   My waitress was very very nice. I didn't get her name. The food is so cheap! I ordered an order of the provolone sticks and a half of the chicken parm sandwich (see photo). Now,  I don't know whether it was because I was extremely hungry, but that chicken parm was probably up there with the top 3 chicken parm sandwiches that I've had in my life. They toasted the hoagie, which I think made a real difference. God, I'm getting hungry thinking about it."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  Home cooking in a down-to-earth dive.  Exactly what I was expecting...excellent food, generous portions and more than reasonable prices. How often can you say you've been to a place where you're satisfied in your belly and happy with the price you paid?   The Italian wedding soup was homemade and incredibly tasty.  Don't expect a fancy presentation, but know you're getting homemade soup.  The salads leave much to be desired, but the house made Italian dressing made me gobble up the lettuce adorned with two olives and one cherry tomato.   On to the main dish--definitely order the veal parmigiana dinner AND the meatballs with spaghetti. The veal was hot and fresh!  Meatballs were moist and jumbo sized.   We truly enjoyed our meal.  Actually, we were curious to try dessert--but the server informed us that they don't offer any sweets because no one can ever finish their plate!!!   Love it and will definitely be back!!!  Thanks Guy Fieri!!!"}
{"text":"I heard many good things about Big Jim's from my husband and friends as well as Yelp, so I knew I had to try it. We went at about 7pm on a Friday night and were seated right away. As the night went on the whole place filled up. I didn't have much expectation as to what the place looked like and I'm glad... It was definitely a dive, but a hidden gem.   We got nachos and cheese for an appetizer and the portion was huge. It took a little while for our food to come out even after we were completely done with our appetizer. However, we had a small child with us and they were good about bringing her food out first.  I got the chicken Parmesan hoagie. It was huge! A half of it would be comparable to a whole hoagie other places. It was pretty good. My husband had the open faced roast beef sandwich and fries and his friend had the roast beef au jus. They both liked their dishes, but thought the roast beef was a bit overdone. The gravy on the sandwich was amazing! Our other friend had the Reuben and it was the best Reuben I've ever had!!  Our server was extremely attentive. We thought the portions were extremely generous for the price and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff. With a party of 10 we all got our food at the same time and it was hot A+ alone for that!!!! I had a lasagna and I swear they brought me a whole pan of it. Everyone was satisfied with what they ordered and how it came out."}
{"text":"My Family was raised in Greenfield. Great working class neighborhood, where everyone looks out and knows one another. I was never raised in Greenfield but still have family close by. Big Jim's has and always will be our family neighborhood restaurant. Big Jim's \"In The Run\" it's not a huge restaurant, not a fancy or sport bar, but it's a really friendly, welcoming restaurant without the decor and ambiance that some have. If you want to say it's a hole in the wall, ok, but it is the nicest, friendliest tastiest hole in the wall,  I have ever been too. don't judge the book by its cover. ok what I am getting at is it's not fancy. It is one of the oldest family neighborhood restaurants left in Pittsburgh.  The portions are huge. The staff is friendly, accommodating and always pleasant. They know your first name and know what you want to order when you sit down.  We have gone as a small family of 2-4 and as a large group of 15-20. I have had almost everything on the menu. I love the Chicken Parm dinner. I recommend the 1/2 LB sandwiches, either in house Roast Beef, or the Corned Beef. Family members have loved the Italian hoagie warm. We love the Chicken Parm hoagie as well. The spaghetti sauce has changed over the years, but it isn't bad. I love the in house Italian dressing, I have tried the recipe they gave me, but have not made it as good as theirs. We have never had the pizza that I can remember. You can't go wrong with anything you try. The homemade Wedding Soup bowl, is a meal in itself. Highly Recommend. See you soon!!  oh .. don't go on a high school football night. it will be hard to get a table. Central Catholic takes up the whole restaurant on friday night football nights. Waiting for a table any other night is worth it !"}
{"text":"No complaints, whatsoever.  The super sketchy location lends to the charm of this place.  The service was nothing short of top-notch.    About the food, the accolades continue.  The wings were (unexpectedly) large and tasty.  These were FULL wings.  The bleu cheese was quality as well.  I had a chicken cordon bleu open-faced sandwich.  The chicken breast was huge and seasoned well, with good ham and cheese, as well as honey mustard."}
{"text":"We went here with my daughter for lunch on Good Friday.  Since we are Catholic that limited our food options.  My wife and I opted for linguine and clam sauce.  She had the white sauce for a change and I had the red.  My daughter had the gnocchi with marinara sauce.  The dishes came with a nice salad with a great Italian dressing which turned out to be the highlight of the meal.  My linguine was over cooked, the clams and accompanying sauce was bland.  My wife's was not much better.  My daughter's gnocchi was the best of the dishes with a good marinara sauce accompanying a large serving.  The meal came with a nice garlic bread basket.    Food - 2-3 Stars - I know that I didn't have there specialties, but I was disappointed with my meal.  I would not return for any of the ones served, knowing there is much better.  Maybe another choice? Atmosphere - 2 Stars If the food was good it would not have mattered, but it is worn. Service - 3 Stars - Average  Price - 3.5 Stars - Large servings but food, heh... OA - 3 Stars - Just average with some pluses and some minuses for this meal."}
{"text":"Found this place on the Food Network app from the Diners, Drive-In & Dives show. I was concerned about going in as it truly is a hole in the wall place but this was the best meal of our entire vacation from NC to Canada. We had the eggplant parmigiana sub, chicken parmigiana sub & fettuccine alfredo- all were fabulous!"}
{"text":"ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES IN PITTSBURGH. Their calzones are seriously twice as big as my head. They're huge! Great, quality Italian and comfort food at incredible prices. Usually packed with locals, a little divey...  Love it!"}
{"text":"Big Jim's is one of my dad's favorite places in Pittsburgh, and we ended up going here a few weeks ago.  I'm not much of a dive girl, but I actually liked this place a lot.  Located under a bridge in Greenfield, this unassuming bar puts out some massive portions at low prices.  I ordered an Italian sub, and my dad got the Veal Parmesan sandwich.  I had some buyer's remorse, as my Italian sub was good but not special, and the veal parm was amazing.  The veal piece was huge and the sandwich was delicious.  They do love their condiments here so ask them to go light if you roll that way  The service here is really pleasant and homey.  Not forced but nice.  It's a very old-school-Pittsburgh-y kind of restaurant.  Once arriving, my brother pointed out that they had been on Triple D.  Who knew?  (Apparently, a lot of people on Yelp, that's who.)"}
{"text":"I had first heard about Big Jim's from my brother because he had seen it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives (this is pathetic as I live so incredibly close to it).  We then saw it on triple D and were intrigued so after finally make plans to go, we just did so tonight.  Despite the dive-y appearance, I have to say there is nothing about Big Jim's that I did not love.    We were promptly greeted by a server, sat in the bar area (where less minors seem to dine so that makes it more enjoyable for adults without children), and were greeted with waters and asked if we had any questions.  So far so good.  On the menu for us tonight was Provolone sticks, wedding soup, Chicken Parm dinner, and Chicken Parm hoagie.  Holy cow was it a ton of food!!!!  The wedding soup was good (no noodles though), the italian dressing on the house salad that came with the Chix parm dinner was AMAZING.  Seriously some of the best dressing I have ever had.  My husband enjoyed the sticks and the hoagie as well.  A++++++!  For $31 and some change (that included an alcoholic beverage as well), you cannot go wrong here.  The chix parm dinner will easily be another meal for one of us as well.  Not the classiest looking of places but if you are the type of person who appreciates good food in a laid back environment, you will love Big Jim's :)"}
{"text":"I have no doubt that this place is a good restaurant with loyal regulars, however my experience was odd to say the least. I took my girlfriend and friend there for their birthdays and we decided to sit at the bar because we wanted to sit on the bar side and there were no tables to sit 3 people. We were told we could not sit at the bar because my girlfriend is only 20, although my friend and I are both 21, understandable. They put 2 tables together and had us sit there. The odd part begins when the server comes over saying that my girlfriend has to sit and the segment of the table farthest away from both mine and my friends drinks. (Basically she couldn't sit across from either of us because of the temptation the alcohol would have imposed on her?) Think that's weird? It gets better. 60 seconds later the server comes back over saying that his boss wants the tables separated a little, so he proceeds to pull them apart 6 inches. Furthermore I am not deaf, if you are going to talk about a table do it behind closed doors. The manager thought I was an informant for a liquor control agency. We laughed because I apparently look like a nark. With that being said I place no blame on the servers because they were just doing what they were told but to the manger I ask, what other restaurant do you know of that does not let an underage person sit with an of age person. That's just silly. We all thought the food was okay but, Big Jim's, was a big experience-- and deserving of my first ever Yelp review."}
{"text":"Mixed emotions here... Saw the episode on DDD's.  Got there about 6:00 on a Saturday night.  Went inside to give our name and it was chaotic.  I asked a server if we could put our name in & she said we had to give it to some guy- wht?  I am not a local and didn't know what she was talking about.  Finally put our name in.  We had about 30 minute wait and there really wasn't anywhere to wait- it was cold outside.  People were coming & going and we were in everyone's way.    My daughter & I ordered a reuben to share.  My other daughter opted for the veggie calzone. Service was crazy slow & the waitress warned us that the calzone would take 30 minutes.  We agreed... 65 minutes later she told us it was almost ready.  I was annoyed and she got defensive.  She said, \"I told you it would take 30 minutes\". I replied with, \"yes, but not over an hour!\".  She didn't care.    The calzone was enough for 4 people.  The reuben would have been ok for one person so there portions didn't seem consistent.  If in the area, I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Big Jim's is an unassuming restaurant in an unassuming neighborhood of  Pittsburgh. Most people don't know where \"the run\" is or where lower greenfield is.  Big Jim's makes it worth investigating.  This is place is the quintessential Pittsburgh dive, but the red Italian is amazeballs.    We split a bowl of the wedding soup with was easily the best version that I have ever had. The escarole really makes it.  I had the chicken parmesan dinner. The included salad was forgettable but the entree was  great. Large crisp chicken breast smothered in a borderline inappropriate amount of cheese.  I got the pasta and it was a little overcooked but serviceable.  My meal was large enough to split with someone but what came next was just downright dirty.  The calzone is at Big Jim's is ridiculous.  It needs to come with a warning other than that it takes 45 minutes.  I am not kidding these calzones could double as tomatoey warming blankets for italian newborns.  My wife and I couldn't come close to finish this.  As for the service, I would like to call it, Pittsburgh friendly. Meaning that in any other city you would assume your server was rude and incompetent but in Pittsburgh it is normal.  Just now what you want before your server gets there.  Bottom line, this place is a dive in the BEST way.  Take the time to get to the run."}
{"text":"Anyone that doesn't know about Big Jim's, you sir, are in for a treat.  I have been to this restaurant  dozens of times, and every time I have been here, It's been exactly the same.  When you walk into Big Jim's, you look like you're walking into an abandoned dive bar,   It's not so clean, you can see the dust blowing around in the air, and there is 30 years of wear and tear, and the decor is a mix of old italian restaurant and catholic church.  the tables and chairs are ugly, and usually kinda sticky.  Now that's out of the way, lets talk about service.  Abysmal.  There is one, two servers tops in the place, and you can wait up to 20 minutes to get drinks.  The food takes a bit of time as well due to the short staff, but this is standard in a dive bar/restaurant.  So you're probably saying to yourself, why did you give this place 4 stars Justin?  Weeeeelllll, the food is fantastic.  If you get a sandwich, expect it to be so big, you have to take a second, collect yourself, and formulate a plan as to how to even get this thing in your mouth.  The veal parmesan sandwich, is the size of a large dinner plate, and just stacked with fried veal (and only 11.95,  seriously?!)  The pizzas have so much cheese, it makes me want to weep.  I have never had anything on the menu that hasn't been cheap, oversized, and crazy good.  For your basic bar foods, this place is killing it.  If you don't mind waiting for it.  They have a short staff on at all times, but they're passing the savings on to you!"}
{"text":"Yes, the portions are gigantic..the calzone one of my party ordered was about the size of a Ford Pinto. This is a wonderful, gritty place, that is oozing with character. The food is more than decent, and our waitress was a sweetheart.  The prices are very reasonable. Be sure to check out the condom dispenser in the men's room for a very funny inscription a patron has written on it."}
{"text":"Actually, more like a 2.5. We left a bit disappointed. We make it a point to hit some Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives when we're on vacation with the kids, and agree with the previous reviewer the Guy missed the mark on this one.  While the portions are \"generous\" to say the least, the food was only \"good.\" My husband and I split the Chicken Parm Hoagie...good, not great. The standout of this sandwich was the hoagie roll...it was amazing. To accompany the sandwich I ordered a dinner salad, my husband the wedding soup. Again, good not great. My son ordered the roast beef and au jus sandwich. Like our sandwich it was enormous and served on an awesome roll, but the awesome stopped there. It was really bland, and the au jus, even more so. However our little one ordered buttered noodles and was pleased as punch. For what's worth, the old school, off the beaten path character of the building was kind of charming. But you can't eat that.  If your goal is a lot of food at a cheap price, this is your stop. If you're looking for an \"off the hook\" dining experience, drive on."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of great sandwiches in the Burgh. Szmidt's, Peppi's and primanti's, they all put out a great product. But the Best Sandwich that I have had in Pittsburgh?? The Reuben at Big Jims in the Run, Greenfield. Sooo spectacular!!! Perfect in every way. I haven't eaten at Gaucha Parilla Argentina yet, so I won't call it the best in the Burgh. But it is the best so far."}
{"text":"After cycling past Big Jim's hundreds of times over the past couple of years, I finally paid a visit this past Sat. evening at 6:30.  When a friend who enjoys large portions on the cheap wanted to go somewhere for dinner, Amanda J.'s review from last week reminded me of Big Jim's, so I suggested that we try it.  Although I've always noticed several cars nearby, I was surprised at how busy it was when we stopped by.  We had to wait for a table, but we were seated in only about 5 min.  In looking at the drink menu, I noticed a cocktail called the Big Jim's cidre which appeared to be a spiced apple cider-like drink, so I decided to try it ($7.50).  I'm glad that I did, since it tasted just like a spiced apple cider with a buzz, complete with a cinnamon stick and cinnamon sugar on the rim.  It was delicious, and I could drink them all day (and night), but as it were, I showed some restraint and stuck to one.  For food, I decided to go with the open faced turkey sandwich ($10.99), since the weather was cool and wet and I was in the mood for some comfort food.  It consisted of sliced roast turkey on bread and fries covered with gravy.  It reminded me vaguely of a similar roast turkey special that my college cafeteria used to serve, minus the mashed potatoes.  Nevertheless, it was pretty tasty, and definitely hit the spot for comfort food.  The one major drawback was the fries, which were clearly fried in old oil, given that they had a bitter taste.  Fortunately, the gravy helped to mask the bitterness, though.  My friend ordered the large fish sandwich ($9.99), which consisted of two huge pieces of fish on a large bun, as well as a large side of cole slaw.  The cole slaw was of the creamy variety, and contained so much mayo that it formed a pool as he ate the slaw.  He ate 75% of the fish and the bun, which impressed me, given the portion size.  Like most customers, we both took home leftovers.  Overall, I was generally pleased with my experience at Big Jim's.  The clientele was definitely on the older side, and struck me as mostly consisting of Greenfield locals.  As others have said, this isn't an ideal date location due to the (lack of) decor, but it's perfectly fine for a casual dinner of comforting food on the cheap.  I'm awarding 3.5 stars because of the gross fries, but if Big Jim's could solve this problem, I'd go with a 4 instead.  While I probably won't rush back soon, I enjoyed my meal and would return the next time I'm in the mood for comfort food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things I've ever heard Guy Fieri say is \"If you're from Pittsburgh, you've heard of 'The Run'\". Guy, I had not heard of the run, and I have yet to meet anyone that, prior to going to Big Jim's, has heard of The Run either(Except for my one friend's grandma). However, I'll not forget The Run - a small stretch in Greenfield near the South Side Works involving a baseball field that has housed this place since 1977 - after having come to Big Jim's.  Big Jim's is full of cheap,largely-portioned food that I think is characteristic of this area. Little flair, decent flavor, no funny business. Enter and take your pick of the dining room or the bar area. There may be a wait(I've been here once or twice with a line out the door, mostly during games. Go another time and you're good to sit just about anywhere). The crowd is a good mix - neighbors, locals, Pitt students. The menu is a selection of mostly fried appetizers, sandwiches, hoagies, some Italian specialties, and pizza.   My favorite item to get here is definitely the veggie hoagie. So simple: Good bread, provalone cheese, brocolli, cauliflower, onions, peppers, carrots, thrown in the oven until the veggies are roasted(Add mayo for me, of course... And sometimes a little ketchup :). This thing tastes amazing, and while I could probably down a full one, I prefer to share it with a side of some kind of appetizer. The spaghetti here is also pretty good, and I've had the eggplant parmesian and it was decent. The entrees will net you garlic bread and spaghetti and a salad, large portions of everything, so don't attempt them alone.  Now all that being said, I do have a few gripes about this place - Number one being that the service is slow. My order usually takes about 20-30 minutes to come back to me, which for a hoagie is kind of crazy in my opinion. The staff is friendly and it's hard to get upset, just don't come here for a 'quick' bite. My other gripe is that while some of the menu is definitely home cookin', other parts of the menu are definitely not, so buyer beware. My girlfriend ordered the applesauce once($1.50) and about 15 minutes later(but well before the rest of our food came) the waitress handed her a generic plastic cup of applesauce, not even opened. I mean come on, at least put the stuff in a dish.  But what are you gonna do. The veggie hoagie is too good to pass up. Just accept the stuff for what it is, and don't try and go on the edge of this place's comfort zone. Stick to what they do best and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am still in amazement about the concept and location of this place.  Never hearing or knowing anything about Big Jim's certainly made my first visit here extra special.  I felt as if I was going on a mini adventure as I traveled down the slope to get there.  My first impression and thoughts upon seeing it was that this place is Pittsburgh through and through! I mean there is a gigantic bridge hovering over it!  It looks like a scene right out of The Deer Hunter. Entering the place was another experience.  It was a warm April evening so there were a couple of locals hanging out on the corner to complete the scene.  Once inside I couldn't believe the number of people who were dining, and the levels of activity taking place here on a Friday.  I was almost getting dizzy from all of the various motions swarming around me.  This place is not for amateurs or for anyone who is claustrophobic.  You must enjoy outdated décor, wood paneling and eclectic collections. On one side of the room is a statue of the Virgin Mary and on the other wall has a hanging beer promo sign. Did I mention that Guy Fieri featured Big Jim's on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives?  His picture is on the wall as well.  The menu is something to study carefully since according to those who were dining with me everything is served in huge portions and tastes excellent.  I tend to be a little more skeptical with such advice so I usually try to order something I cannot order anywhere else. However, the more I looked the more I realized that the easiest thing to do was to order a draft beer and a steak hoagie and just simply plan multiple trips here in order to try a little bit of everything!  The food, service, and atmosphere is certainly a treasure to be repeated."}
{"text":"Food was just awesome; and Scott our host/waiter was the best ever, never an empty drink and great personality. We had the meatballs, pizza and chicken Parm hoagies. We just LOVED being there!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Pittsburgh when I'm hungry.  The portions are big and so is the flavor.  You cannot beat this place.  Their house Italian is great and while their Veal Parm is simple, it is done very well.  If you want to have a cheap, relaxed meal and do not mind dated, dusty paintings that you may find in your grandmother's attic on the walls around you, then go to Big Jim's."}
{"text":"If your Pittsburgh experience has thus far been constrained to the hot trendy spots, do yourself a favor and jump out of your comfort zone and give Big Jim's a shot. This place had been on our list for years and we finally made down there. Now, I had no idea who the hell this guy from the Food Network is, but he knows a good meal when he finds one. We worked our way down to lower Greenfield to this old-school neighborhood bar and restaurant and dove in. There's always this little nervousness of being made to feel like an outsider in this kind of place, but not only was our welcome from our waiter warm and helpful, the folks seated around us were engaging and enthusiastic, making menu suggestions, cracking jokes. It was like we'd been invited into someone's house for a holiday dinner.  I got the Chicken Parm, which is literally a couple of pounds of moist, delicately breaded and fried chicken breast covered in delicious sauce and served on a bed of spaghetti. I'm a big guy who likes to eat, and it took a dedicated effort to finish half of my plate. A young man of 18 in our party, a broad-shouldered defensive tackle with a deeply ambitious attitude, was likewise stalled by his Veal parm sandwich which, it is true, is literally served on a full loaf of italian bread. The thing was bigger than his head. Literally. Mrs. Junk ordered the Reuben, which was delightful, while our final diner sat down to the insanely large and delicious calzone.   This isn't a birdseed joint--this is big food with big bold taste, served up hot and fresh in a place where everyone was happy and friendly. There should be more places like this in a world too full of strip-mall generic places like Chilis and Fridays. This is the real deal.  I note a negative review from someone who is whining about waiting for a table and dissing Greenfield, a solid working class neighborhood, as \"shady\" and I just want to say that those words are an insult. Greenfield might not be Lawrenceville or (thank god) the trendy mess that hipsters have made of East Liberty, but it is a safe and welcoming place where folks raise their families. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"This is not a place I would take a serious foodie or critic, BUT there is something to love about Big Jim's. It really defines Pittsburgh to me before a lot of people from out of town started to pour in. It is a family restaurant.   Their portions are enormous. They are not located in a ritzy part of town on the rise. The decor is absolutely just okay. But it is a very fun place to be. If you want to eat a lot of pasta or nice eggplant parmesan dinner, relax and unwind; you came to the right place.   I ordered the baked ziti and it came with soup or salad and garlic bread. Everything was pretty plain but you could add as much dressing or salt as you would like. My ziti dish was bigger than my head and covered with cheese. Needless to say, we took home serious leftovers."}
{"text":"I first noticed this place on my run, then I came across it in a Pittsburgh traveling guide and finally, some 5 months later, I had an opportunity to visit yesterday. It's in a part of Greenfield called The Run, tucked away from main roads and traffic. Parking is super easy, the neighborhood looks a little sketch but I've ran here at night in the dark and it seems fine.  The restaurant was packed! For this location, I thought it would be pretty empty. Lots of families, relaxing and enjoying their huge dinners. We were seated right away, with people constantly checking up on us, right away we got beer and menus. I'd say we had 3 waiters as all of them made sure everything was great.   The food is home-style, comfort food - lots of hoagies, sandwiches and pasta, they have their menu online. I ordered a 2-bill sandwich: corned beef, swiss cheese, slaw and a fried egg. It was HUGE and came with more coleslaw. It sounds like they only have 4 beers on tap.  Highlight of my meal - noticing Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives poster on a wall, autographed. I'm not a huge fan of the show but still thought it pretty cool to eat at a place featured on Food Network's show!"}
{"text":"Remember the little neighborhood Italian restaurant in the old neighborhood you knew you could always stop by for a square meal? The place with the pizza the eggplant parm and the wine beer and full bar? Dinner salads garlic bread and most classic Italian American entrees? Add on bar standards plus huge deli sandwiches and fresh cut fries, yeah, kinda like that... Servers amazingly friendly;  kitchen on point, you can even use your card to pay in this joint! Wheezy? No problem in here, you'll find nobody smoking while you're drinking your beer. Yup smoke free and takes plastic!! A Greenfield Run Gem! We like it so much we've gone over and over again! The bartenders are the coolest. Just be sure to arrive hungry, you'll have leftovers if you don't share with a buddy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. Certainly a hidden gem. I of course have to comment on the absolute delicious wedding soup. It's hard to find good wedding soup in a restaurant; it's usually either bland or too salty. But Big Jim's gets it just right. They're other dishes are equally yummy and the portions are always huge. Love the pasta with white clam sauce - so many clams!  Have also eaten the gnocchi but ordered it with a marinara rather than the meat sauce. They took a bit long to cook but were well worth the wait. Also, all pasta dishes come with a yummy warm and buttery garlic toast! Have also tried steak sandwich and the premium grilled chicken sandwich which are both also good. The bread is fabulous.   Have never been hungry enough for dessert but I'm sure it would rock."}
{"text":"The only reason I want to try this little dive tucked away on a barely lit street was because my dear dad saw it listed in one of his cooking magazines since it had been featured on DDD (you know the show I mean). I wish I knew what Guy recommended so I could decided what to try from the massive selection! I am not a burger person, but the hot pot roast and fries with gravy sounded pretty good to me! When I saw the gigantic plate coming from the kitchen I knew right away I couldn't finish it. For the price, the portion size alone is a value!  I did also order Wedding soup. Something I never even heard of before moving to Pittsburgh, The soup itself was very delicious. Not bland and with few meatballs (which is FINE with me!). At least I didn't have to ask for the Parmesan cheese, the server brought it out with the soup.  My meal itself was just okay. The bread was kind of tough and hard to cut. The beef didn't have much flavor, but the gravy helped this. The fries, sadly, tasted like the oil they were cooked in needed changed badly. At first I though maybe it was just that there was still skin left on the potatoes, but Darren pointed out the oil problem.  Another comment, WHAT IS WITH THIS AREA AND CURT SERVERS??? If you aren't from Pittsburgh I think you'll be shocked at the rudeness. Darren seems used to it (swearing that \"they aren't being rude\")...and if this is what you get used to here, I am heartbroken. Is friendly service too much to ask for?  If I decide to come back, I will try a different sandwich."}
{"text":"So disappointing!!!  Overrated fish sandwich was dry and tasteless.  The frenchfies were grease laden and soggy.  Never make this mistake again.i went too far out of my way because of rave reviews to come up short and nauseated.  Roland's please!"}
{"text":"Massive servings, friendly folks.   First timer. Decent meal all around. I had the Reuben, one of my favorite sandwiches, so I had to try it here. Great big tasty bread (toasted, not grilled), yummy kraut and cheese. But the corned beef .. well, they didn't cook it there. Must have come in with the rest of the cold cuts.  Not the reubens I'm used to.   I will come by for the veal parm, though. There's enough quality to bring me back."}
{"text":"This is somewhere between 3 and 4 (give it a 3.5).  The chicken parm hoagie is a 5.  It is awesome - big, tasty, awesome.  Wife got stuffed shells - they were good, the cheese was fresh and soft.  I liked the marinara, but the wife said it was just ok, a little bland.  Meatballs did lack flavor - pretty bland and a little disappointing.  Excellent service - seemed like a real neighborhood place.  The pizza looked damn good - we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went to this place a few times as a kid and didn't think much of it.  Just a few months back my wife and I were watching \"Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives\" on Food Network and Big Jim's was featured.  The wife and I decided we would pay a visit on our next trip to Pittsburgh.  We stopped in for lunch and got our eat on.  It's probably not good for you to eat here too often, but it was fun for lunch.  It definitely falls in the \"Dives\" category of Guy Fieri's show.  My mom and wife split a chicken parm sandwich (photo attached).  My bro-in-law had a meatball hoagie (also photo attached).  I had the Italian hoagie and we also split some fries with sides of cheese and gravy.  Everything was sinfully tasty.  We rolled out the door to the car and went home and napped."}
{"text":"Don't get the Rueben.  1st off it's baked not grilled.  You grill a Reuben!  The bread is cut too thick and ends up hard on the edges and wet in the middle from the sour kraut."}
{"text":"Big Jim's is my comfort place to go. The people are wonderful (especially Scott) ;) Never had a bad meal there. Ever.  It's good to unwind there when the traffic is backed up on the Parkway which is always the case. Or just when I need a really good home cooked meal. The portions are huge but its the quality that keeps me going back. A great neighborhood restaurant tucked away \"in the run\". The chicken wings are whole and meaty and cooked perfectly. Everything is fresh and delicious.   The lasagne is cheesy and that sauce ! Perfectly seasoned. There's no skimping on quality. Love love love the fish. As long as they are open, I will remain a loyal customer."}
{"text":"What a hole in the wall! But who cares? The food is delicious. :) We started off with house salads. The dressing was awesome but I handed my olives over to T who gladly accepted. For my meal I had the chicken parm. The plate was the size of my body. Not my head, my body. Delicious. Covered in gooey cheese and piping hot, rich red sauce. Yum. The pasta was less impressive and the reason for the missing star above. Bland bland bland. Just needed to add a little salt to the cooking water and all would have been well. But no matter. I concentrated on the chicken and left stuffed. I would definitely go back to try other offerings. The sandwiches were obscenely large but looked awesome."}
{"text":"Went there with a coworker ten minutes before they closed and they still took care of us with delicious take out food.  I have been there several times before, and have never been disappointed.  Fabulous spaghetti and the biggest meatballs of any restaurant I have ever been too....almost as big as baseballs!  Maybe not the fanciest place you will ever go to, and sometimes it is a bit crowded, but by all means.....go.....and go hungry."}
{"text":"Big Jim's smaller than other restaurants and the decor is not much to write home about, but they do have flat screen televisions in the both dining room and bar if you're into that.  The parking can be tricky, because they don't have a parking lot and the restaurant is situated on the edge of crowded neighborhood, whose resident all use street parking for their own vehicles.   Their Italian wedding soup is solid, even though it doesn't have noodles in it, which I'm used to. I love that they use escarole instead of spinach, because it holds up in the broth better.   The veal Parmesan sandwich is what gets people in the door, 1) because Guy Fieri ate it, and  2) because it's monstrous and delicious. I myself don't like veal but at least one person at the table, normally my dad, always orders it and takes at least 1/2 home. And taking half home is worth mentioning because my dad knows how to EAT and he still has enough for another meal!  I have had the meatball sandwich which is huge and the meatballs are delicious, with plenty of sauce to keep them from drying out. They also pack on the cheese and melt it, which is so good!  Last week, I tried their Antipasto Salad. One might think, it's just a salad who cares! Let me tell you, I can't stop thinking about how good the salad was. First of all, there was a ton of fresh sliced lunchmeat that tasted more like deli meats then your run-of-the-mill cold cuts from the supermarket. They were so good! The salad itself had to be the portion equivalent of 2 whole bags of salad mix from the grocery store- it was massive.  It also had a nice selection of black olives, whole peppercinis, cheese, and tomatoes. The ranch dressing tasted homemade and they gave a nice portion size. The salad also came with sliced garlic bread but I didn't partake in that because I cut back on my carbs. It looked and smelled delicious though. It's on par with the prices of salads at other restaurants, with three times the portion size. You may even want to share this with a friend.   Listen. I know this place is a total dive but it's one of those places you just can't deny. The food is homemade and excellent - and not just because Fieri went there. It truly is stick to your ribs & you better believe you are taking home a doggy bag at the end of the meal, while still unbuttoning your pants because you ate too much."}
{"text":"Went for dinner here with my friends. The chicken parmigiana that I had was delicious and the portion was huge. Totally worth the money."}
{"text":"Excellent find. We came here because of Yelp reviews. And we're really happy we did. Our table of nine started at the bar for an hour and had great appetizers (the bartender steered us to zucchini and it was fantastic). We loved seeing the various foods come to the tables.   Our table had massive amounts of food. Perhaps the best was the corned beef on rye. It was incredible. So was the meatball sub. That was pretty amazing too.  If and when I get back to Pittsburgh, off all the places I dined, this is THE ONE I would make a point to return to."}
{"text":"Very sub par. Won't be back. Ate there after not being there for years and was sooo disappointed. Sauce, noodles tasted old, watery. Large portions but not appealing. Waitress was pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend for dinner.  We decided to come here after randomly seeing it featured on a repeat of Guy Fieri's Diners Drive-Ins And Dives earlier in the week.  The outside is not too much to look at but the inside is comfortable.  Appropriately we were seated right underneath a Guy Fieri poster that proclaimed that the Veal Parmigiana \"as big as yer head\".  As you would expect with food that large it seemed that everyone that was leaving the restaurant had a to-go box.  We knew from the episode that they make their wedding soup from scratch daily and so started off with a cup of that.  It had a good taste to it and had much more chicken flavor than most wedding soups that I have had in the past.  The escarole as a green was also pretty nice.  For my entree I decided on having the Veal Parmigiana sandwich as I wanted to see how big it actually was while my girlfriend decided upon the lasagna.  Both portions were quite large with the sandwich being as large as advertised and I have a picture to prove it!  It actually ended up being so big that I could not possibly fit my mouth around it.  So I ended up taking off the top which essentially made it into two open faced sandwiches.  The bread was crispy while the veal was fried nicely and the sauce and cheese complimented the rest nicely.  My only complaint with it is that it was a bit dry and I think that some more sauce could have been helpful with that.  Even so, the half of the sandwich that I ate tasted good.  My girlfriends lasagna also seemed to be a super sized portion as it filled up her whole plate.  It had a lot of ricotta cheese in it which helped to give it an overall flavor that I enjoyed.  Like almost everyone else that I saw, we ended up leaving with some to-go boxes as I still had half of my sandwich left and my girlfriend half of her lasagna.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  It was a cool little place in which you definitely get a huge portion size for your money and the food is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"So everyone remembers Cheers, right? (Google it if you're too young.) This place is Cheers for me. Every single human that works here is friendly, knows the menu back and forth, and can make an intelligent conversation.   Best friend Emma and I came here on a Saturday night near the end of happy hour in December. Josh's suggestion, and I'm so glad he knew this place.   The menu is huge. Sandwiches, salads, pasta, and your traditional greasy bar grub. Emma had a hankering for cheese sticks, and I asked Tim, the barkeep, what he suggested for my starter. He said Fried Zucchini. Man, he was speaking my language. After a short wait; everything was steaming in front of us. Emma's cheese sticks were just that, but still melty and delicious. Those zucchini planks though. WOW. Tim said they hand bread them to order, and slice them fresh everyday. You could tell. And their ranch was amazing too.   Then came the sandwiches. I got the Roast Beef Au Jus. HOLY CATS this sandwich is large. Emma decided on a steak hoagie with lettuce, ranch, and tomato. She loved it. The bread was toasted just right on both sandwiches. Mine was apparently the last roast beef to be served that day, and I'm so glad I got it before they ran out. That sandwich was good. Even hours later as leftovers, Josh said it was great.   Find this place. Go. Now. Sit at the bar. Get food. Get happy. Tip your bartender.   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this out of the way restaurant for some time now since I've heard good things about the food and the prices. Driving through the area it would be easy to miss Big Jim's.  The outside of it makes it look like that it's more of a community bar. We weren't really greeted when we came in and stood at the front for a few minutes before I asked someone if we sat ourselves or needed to be seated.   The food was really great and the prices were indeed very fair. The employees need to do a better job at cleaning up tables and debris left at other tables from patrons who have already left. Sitting next to tables full of dirty plates wasn't ideal."}
{"text":"I visit Pittsburgh very often,  but have never been to big Jim's before. They were featured on diners drive ins and dives. We had a bit of a wait because there were 8 of us and they had to put a few tables together, but didn't have any close enough when we arrived. The wait was totally worth it. Our waitress was Heather and she was great! She had the best memory, as she didn't write one order down. That always makes me nervous and puts a lot of pressure on the waitress. But she totally knocked the service out of the park! She didn't get one thing wrong- which is awesome. The food was great! The dinners were huge and tasty. The lasagna was probably the size of my head and the meatballs probably the size of my fist. They give you a lot of food for a decent price! I like we have definitely discovered a gem and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying: I was wrong.   This was my husband's choice. I did NOT want to go. DD&D is not really my thing; I actually find guy fieri obnoxious and ignorant as a \"chef\". I'm glad he chose this place, though, because I'm glad I got to try it (probably due to my husband and him) and I'm glad if it got them business!   I relented and decided to join them anyway. We pulled up and I was still skeptical; definitely not a beautiful facade. We went in, and let's say the inside is about the same. There's a bar side to the right and a dining room to the left. Both look like they haven't been remodeled since he 70s? Not looking good for me.  We ordered drinks - we got the big Jim special brew that's made just for them - REALLY GOOD! Kind of a mixture of yuengling and Killians Irish red if I had to describe it.   I decided to get the chicken parm, my husband got the two bills sandwich, and my son got the kids cheeseburger and fries. Pictures are worth a thousand words. Please look at them haha! We both said that we wouldn't b able to go to the grocery store and buy ingredients to make what we had for the price, and we wouldn't have made it as good. Usually if you get quantity, quality lacks, but you get both here! Oh, almost forgot. Side salad was really good - highly recommend the Parmesan peppercorn!!! Garlic bread is really good too.   Will we be back? Absolutely! Service was adequate and I have now come to realize the location and atmosphere are actually part of the whole experience! So good!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite comfort food restaurants in Pittsburgh!! I have been here over a handful of times already and I just heard about this place within the last year. The portions are HUGE and so AMAZING! Their italian food is to die for and I love their chicken parm! For along the divey atmosphere but that is what my boyfriend and I love. Very relaxed, and it is like your aunt or cousin is your server. Family friendly as well!"}
{"text":"When I visit restaurants, I usually order TO GO. I also order 3 to 5 different meals, in order to objectively judge the establishments. Ordering one meal at Big Jim's is enough to feed 3 people AND THEY WILL ALL LOVE IT. One of the best reuben sandwiches outside of New York and GREAT DINNERS. If you are in Pittsburgh, skip Primanti's and go to Big Jim's."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I agree that we both love food but we often have a difference of opinions when it comes to what kind of food we like.  He likes eating at restaurants that make him feel like he is at home in Florida, eating what his mother would make for him. I prefer trying something different and saving the home style dishes to my mom. Big Jim's is a place where we both agree. It is delicious!  The first thing that I would like to point out are the prices. Almost everything is under $10. Even when i am at home ordering food for myself I am usually spending $20. But the prices at Big Jim's are undeniably fair.   The food is definitely more home style than what I usually am after but the wedding soup is perfect and the chicken parm sandwich is perfectly crispy and saucy and cheesy and delicious. It is also the size of my head (which is quite the big, roundish dome).   The place is always packed but the service does not suffer. The beer list is also surprisingly awesome! All around, a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"With so many new semi-pretentious restaurants opening in Pittsburgh, it's nice that we finally discovered Big Jim's, making it \"new\" to us! It took me nearly six years of living in PIttsburgh, but I may have finally found that go-to, no-frills Italian restaurant that suits our laid back attitudes and selective palates.  I've ran, biked, and driven past Big Jims over and over throughout the years, but never even realized it was there. It's so unassuming and dive-y, that it's easy to miss, but stopping in is definitely worth your time.  We've ordered takeout a few times and eaten in a few times already, and it's never really disappointed. The staff has always been really attentive and nice when dining in, and takeout has always satisfied...even when they gave me the wrong hoagie once, it was delicious enough to forgive them.  Their chicken parm hoagies and dinner are both excellent, and the dinner is big enough to eat family-style. Good luck finding food in those portions, with that flavor, for under $11 somewhere else. The housemade Italian dressing is phenomenal, and should seriously be bottled and sold. We've only tried the white pizza so far, but it was delicious. I've had the Italian hoagie and cheese steak hoagie, as well. Both were good...although I used their Italian dressing on the Italian hoagie, which almost isn't fair, since that stuff could make anything amazing.  If you're looking for a place to get a good hoagie, pizza, or simple Italian meal that's so reasonably-priced you feel like you're ripping Big Jim off, this is the place."}
{"text":"This is a local favorite not a tourist trap or Pitt attraction.   If you are anywhere near Pittsburgh I highly recommend you stop by and try one of their OVERSIZED sandwiches.   Their veal parmigiana is double stacked, moist inside yet crispy outside. Perfectly fried; not soggy. Then it's covered with their homemade sauce & fresh mozzarella and served on a big delicious soft Italian roll.  The meat sub is equally as good. They put four HUGE delicious meatballs smothered in sauce & mozzarella on a Italian hoagie. Ba Da Bing!   Good luck trying to finish off one of their large sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood, great little divey place, and good food at great prices. I play basketball at the hoops courts down in the Run and often will stop by Big Jim's afterward to get some much needed sustenance.   The portions are huge and almost everything is good. The last time I was there I got the Reuben and it did not disappoint. Stacked high with meat and good tasting and I think it was only around 8 dollars.   The service at the bar isn't all that attentive, but by no means is poor. It is exactly what you would expect at a place like this. If you are looking for a fancy night out this surely isn't the place, but it is absolutely perfect for what it is. Cheap food and drinks in huge portions."}
{"text":"Had the reuben, which was good and big enough for two. Will try the veal parmagian sandwich next time."}
{"text":"Saw this joint featured on an episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives while on a road trip, so stopped in. The show raved about the veal parm sandwich, so we tried that. Absolutely freakin amazing. Huge! Glad we decided to split it along with a bowl of escarole soup- equally good.  The place itself reminded me of an old Philadelphia corner bar- kinda dark and simply appointed. Mixed review on service as our waiter was real short on conversation whereas the barmaid was super friendly.  Would definitely go back if I found myself in Pitt again."}
{"text":"I first went to Big Jim's because of media coverage on the Food Network, and Big Jim's did not disappoint! I ordered gnocchi, meatballs in marinara, and something else that I cannot remember (which is unfortunate because it was so good!) Their meatballs were enormous, delicious, and filling! I believe what made them so tasty was the marinara sauce, which they knocked out of the ball park! Gnocchi was cooked well, soft and chewy, not mushy. Garlic bread was an absolute favorite of mine, especially with the marinara sauce!   The one thing I didn't like was having the food coma after the meal and literally going into hibernation for the rest of the day, but I'm really just trying to shift the blame for my gluttony. As with any Italian food goes, it can all get a little heavy with all the carbs and meat sauces. Overall, a place I would go back to!"}
{"text":"A staple in Pittsburgh.  You get big portions in this place, so come hungry or you ll have leftovers for the next couple days.  This time of year, it s all about fish! They have a Friday Lenten menu:  Fish, fried or broiled, Mac n Cheese and or Huluski or Crabby cakes.  Stop in at least one time during Lent."}
{"text":"Since I have family that lives down the street, I have been coming to Big Jim's for over 20 years. I used to really enjoy coming here but stopped visiting several years ago. Although the food was always good, the place was getting dirtier every time I was there.  Yesterday my wife and I decided to stop for lunch. I figured that the place was probably cleaned up since the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives episode. After being seated, I wanted to leave. To be honest, I don't know why I stayed. Nothing had changed. In fact I think it got worse.  The floor was filthy. There was food under tables that looked like it was there for days. Remember, I was here for lunch and they just opened. The tables and chairs in the dining room looked as though they were purchased at a yard sale. Very old and falling apart.  The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the service and food was good. I had an Italian hoagie and my wife had a salad. Both tasted good but I really couldn't enjoy it.  I kept thinking that if the dining room was this dirty, what is the kitchen like?"}
{"text":"Huge portions, great prices, and friendly faces. I recommend the veal parm sandwich"}
{"text":"Huge portions. I ate my leftovers the next day and still couldn't finish it. Had the veal parmesan. It was OK. I\"ve had better, but it wasn't bad. The side salad was unbelievable. Huge again, with lots of extras and great creamy italian. It was really good. Good service too, never had to wait. They had huge sandwiches too.  If I lived here, I'd eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Another DDD spot! We found our way to this Pittsburgh neighborhood and after spending some time searching for a parking spot entered the packed (and noisy) restaurant. We were seated quickly and looked over the menu. Plenty of choices! We ended up with veal parmigiana and baked ziti with meatballs. If you can finish all you get, you have an incredible appetite. Both meals were served with several options. We picked coleslaw (pretty good) and salad. My wife loved the homemade Italian dressing. Although they don't sell it, our waitress made sure to send us home with extra. Our meals arrived within a decent time of our order and were appropriately hot. My veal parmigiana was excellent. The breading was not too heavy and had very good flavor. I could have used a little more sauce; however, it was good even without it. My wife enjoyed her meal. All three staff members we were in contact with with friendly and helpful. We couldn't have asked for a better waitress. I'd go back (probably to try the pizza ora sandwich, since they looked great)!"}
{"text":"A first class neighborhood restaurant and bar. Extensive menu of hoagies, sandwiches, burgers, and some Italian pasta dishes.   For most folks, I would recommend bringing a friend or love one and sharing an entree and a side. The sandwiches are very big. I had the veal parmigiana sandwich plus fried mushrooms and ended up with half in a carryout container. Other than being huge, my sandwich came in first class crusty, toasty italian bread. Very, very tasty!  Parking behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Amid the modern scene of strip mall restaurant chains and tired cliches masquerading as innovative establishments, Big Jim's is a refreshing surprise. For those of us who were children in the 70s or 80s, a visit to Big Jim's becomes a bit of a time warp back to childhood. It's divey, dark, and the decor probably hasn't changed since the place opened in 1977. In other words, it's pretty freaking awesome.  If time warping to the late 70s isn't enough for you, how about giant portions of delicious comfort food? Bring your appetite and a friend. The meals here are immense. My husband, 3-year-old daughter, and I all shared a chicken parm sandwich and I still had a little piece of my portion to bring home. The chicken was tender and generously topped with flavorful marinara and melted cheese. Oh, and the bread. Can't forget the bread. The sandwich is served on a crusty half loaf of delicious Italian bread.   Overall, I think this place is great. Bear in mind that the criticisms of other reviewers - digs about the decor or the uniforms - were positive in my book. I love that this place has likely never been renovated. If it were to be renovated, I probably would never go back. I like time travel.  Oh, and as a side note, Big Jim's was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. Take that as you will. If you pride yourself on visiting places that are featured on television shows, then put this on your list. If not, still put this restaurant your list because it's a funky place straight out of the 70s with excellent food.   Happy time traveling!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went out to dinner very spur of the moment. We were headed to another restaurant and when we got there it was closed. So we were driving around trying to find a place to eat. Finally we ended up at this place. We had been on quite a journey and we were starving so we were excited to eat. The outside is all brick with two Mary statues in the small section of grass. We had no idea what to expect.  We went in and were greeted by several employees. You could sit in the bar or dining area. We sat in the bar. We decided we were going to share food. The food on the menu was American traditional. We went for a white pizza and a Reuben. Their prices were really cheap so we were curious how our food would be.  The pizza came out first. It looked wonderful. It tasted wonderful!  Sometimes white pizza can be bland but this was not the case here. It was some of the best white pizza I've ever had.  Then the Reuben came. It m, too, looked good. We didn't hesitate to dig in. They put the Thousand Island spread on the side. We slathered it on and took a bite. WOWZA!  Best Reuben, hands down.  The food was so good we wanted to order more just to try it but we were beyond full. I went home and told my family I had a new place to go as a family."}
{"text":"Always stop here when in Pittsburgh... Love the Italian wedding soup.. Great pizza!! Always get a lasagna to go for the next day.. Calzones are huge !! More than enough to share with the table. Best chicken parm sandwich you will ever have . Most stop in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Love Big Jims. Have been going here for over 15 years our go to place for bar food with big portions. This is a typical Pittsburgh bar: Virgin Mary statue out front & cold beers inside. I love it! Decor needs updated but I come for the food & prices! 6 adults with alcohol cost $112....can't beat it. I ordered with hot sausage hoagie...really delicious sausage, crisp bun & right amount of spiciness. The Big Jims calzone: worth the 45 minute wait! HUGE & extra to take home. Wedding soup also on point. Definitely make a reservation on a Friday or Saturday as their dining room is teeny."}
{"text":"A real neighborhood treasure.  I came after reading reviews, and I was not disappointed.  Very friendly service and great food.  I had the Rigatoni with meat sauce and meatballs.  I am a meatball snob and I wish they let their meatballs cook in the sauce, but they were still really good.   Very welcoming place and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood restaurant/bar. I went with friends on the recommendation of a Food Network host, and was not disappointed. The food is greasy, delicious, and comes in large portions.  Not to mention, it's cheap. Be prepared to wait, though - it's a popular place!"}
{"text":"Price: can't beat it - we had a huge feast for 3 for less than $50. Service: friendly but slow.  Italian wedding soup: good but I hardly had any meatballs in my cup.  Pizza: only thing good about it was the sauce. Fries with gravy: one of my favorite apps that we tried. Jumbo wings: the hot ones are made with red hot and butter which is always good. Lots of meat on them too. Chicken parmesan sandwich: one of the best I've had anywhere. Very moist chicken. Fish sandwich: okay but not my favorite.  Overall, I'd give this place 3 stars but would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a cheap night out with decent food (or great food if you order the chicken parm sandwich)."}
{"text":"My dad lived in Greenfield  for a time during his reckless, Dead End Kids youth and for years has spoken well of Big Jim's and of the godlike sandwiches they serve. Watching it become nationally famous through Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" was exciting, surreal, and made me all the more anxious to stop by.   Shockingly, Kay had this place bookmarked for months! The other night, we decided to put off a visit no longer.   Unassuming during the day, ominous after dark, Big Jim's occupies a building that sits below a poorly-lit underpass in a portion of the neighborhood known as \"The Run.\"   When you walk in, however, you are greeted graciously like a longtime friend and fed lovingly with hefty helpings of food that runs the gamut from bar and diner fare to good old Sunday evening homestyle cooking.   It was the latter path that Kay chose with her Italian Wedding Soup and Hot Roast Beef Sandwich entree. The sandwich was a mountain of beef, bread, gravy, and fries that poor Kay only halfway finished.   Dad recommended either the Italian Hoagie or the Bacon Burger. Thankfully, I listened to reason and didn't attempt to devour both, so I just went with the burger and was rewarded with an archetypal patty that was burly, copiously juicy, criminally fresh, and sublimely cooked to my specifications. In fact, EVERYTHING about this burger was open-faced perfection, from the veggies and sharp, solid, chilly, dill pickle to a bun so blessedly baked and brand-new, my imagination led me to believe that it had sprung from the ovens of Shangri-La. All hail Big Jim's Bacon Burger. Its place in the pantheon has been quickly secured.   However, their fries, served in an insurmountable heap along with all else on their menu, need work. Brown, greasy, and limp, I've honestly had better fries at Eat N Park. I coulda, shoulda ordered onion rings. Oy.  Remember kids, cut them fresh, change the oil regularly, fry them twice.   The atmosphere was very casual, talkative, and family-oriented, and the service was friendly, speedy, and graceful; our waiter didn't miss a beat in spite of how busy the restaurant was.   I'll certainly be back for that Italian Hoagie. Until then...  P.S. Who didn't know that a framed picture of Guy Fieri would be on the wall?"}
{"text":"I went to Big Jims while on vacation. The calzone was the size of a small child and fed all 6 people at our table. Everything we had was friggin delicious... My friends and I still talk about this place often. Go, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Solid three stars and as others have said it's 100% a dive. Had chicken parm dinner and some meatballs on the side. The parm was right around average and the meatballs were definitely below par. However, for the price and the amount of food you get there is definitely good value for the money, but not somewhere that I have to rush back to next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I went here after seeing that it had been on one of the TV shows. Service was nice and friendly but...   I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs, with great expectations.  I didn't find much flavor in the sauce OR the meatballs and, when it came time to get the bill, \"something\" crawled up on my table - maybe it wanted to pay for my dinner but I still proceeded to 'make it go away' with a napkin.  I spared the nice waitress any details, just paid and left with no plans of going back...  (There is a cool little walking path from the restaurant all the way to Carnegie Mellon.)"}
{"text":"The Baked Ziti was really good , very good meat sauce!  You get a lot , I only finished half, but that's good I can eat the rest tomorrow!  I also got salad with the meal!  The waitress was friendly and served us right away!  It's a family owned bar and restaurant, it's not fancy , but the food and service are good!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good, old-fashioned Italian 'food' served in heaping mounds for a reasonable price - Big Jim's should be THE place to go.  I first learned of Big Jim's many, many years ago, when a friend introduced me to this hidden gem.  Some changes have been made since that era, but nothing for the worse.  They used to be a very closed-in smoking establishment, but the new laws have stopped that, and the result is that you can eat without watching the nicotine drip from the walls.  I'm a smoker, but the atmosphere used to be even too thick for me to fully enjoy.  But even then, the food made it worth the trip.  Big Jim's is a divey bar/restaurant tucked into a hidden corner of Greenfield that they call 'the run'. It is by far, nothing fancy. Wood paneled walls, framed tacky prints bearing scenes of Italy occasionally, or scenes of the burgh. Truly, nothing to look at.  TVs dot the rooms, usually playing local news, or of course, da game - whichever one happens to be playing.   The service can be hit or miss - we're not talking high end customer service here. You may get an attitude from someone who looks like a mobile home park escapee, or you might get just efficient cordial service from someone who looks like a college student that Starbuck's wouldn't hire.  But really, that's not even important in this setting.  The gold mine that Big Jim's offers is very good food in jumbo portions, and at a truly reasonable price.  I've taken several out of towners to Big Jim's and rarely have they not gone home with leftovers in a take out box.  The pasta dishes are tasty and large, and most meals come with a side salad, or other side of your choice. Order something like lasagna or chicken or eggplant parmigiana, and you're either a Hoover in disguise, or you're taking some home.  The last time I visited, I saw a VERY large man in a Pitt sports outfit at the next table order a calzone.  It took a while to arrive, but when it did, the man's eyes nearly bugged out.  And he was a BIG football player type. The calzone truly looked like a large pizza folded in half. This ginormous sports machine - took half home.   The appetizers are good. I recommend the fried zucchini planks, but everything I've had has been plentiful and tasty. I've eaten the lasagna (took half home) chicken parmigiana (took half home), eggplant parmigiana (took half home), the linguini with white clam sauce (ok, ate all of that), hot sandwiches, and more, and I've never been unfulfilled or disappointed.  They have gnocchi in a red sauce (I swear they used to have it in a creamy cheese sauce, but that seems to have disappeared from the menu - shame too, it was yum), and even have things for the non-Italian people, like cheesesteak sandwiches, open faced roast beef and  fries smothered with gravy.  Once again I say - I am NOT a 'foodie'.  I like FOOD.  And Big Jim's is a place that can fill you up and not rip you off.  Two enormous entrees usually coming with a side, a soda, an appetizer or two, and a meal for the next day's lunch - the bill usually comes to just under $30.  It's a hidden gem - so get out your mapquest or GPS - and find it!"}
{"text":"Actually I would give Big Jim's 4 1/2 stars.  The first time we've been here, even though we grew up in the area.  It is so far off the path that you never remember it's there (I am old and forget things if I don't see them). Well it was crowded on a Sunday evening at 7pm - that was a good first sign. The outside is nothing fancy...looks like a dive. Our server Heather was the first part of this experience that got my attention. She took our drink order and wrote nothing down. She answered all our questions at the very beginning and was so kind and pleasant. When we placed our dinner order she still wasn't writing down and got everything perfect!!  They offer a big bowl of coleslaw with your meal if you don't want a salad. The cole slaw was very creamy. Then the main event.  I remember hearing their meatballs were a big attraction, I ordered the meatball parmigiana.... flabbergasted is the word that describes my reaction to that plate being placed in front of me. It was massive!  Those could have been the best meatballs I ever had. They were not tough or tight but rather loose and soft. Good balance of garlic salt and other flavors.  Yummy!!    The lasagne was epic and everyone tasted it and loved the flavors.  The garlic toast is yummy and the service good!  I think Big Jim's will be added to our repertoire!!  A truly Pittsburgh kinda place!"}
{"text":"Very cool little corner of town.  It might look a bit sketchy, but was very safe.  Extremely good Reuben and a frosty pint of beer.  Will come here again"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding!!! I usually get their chicken sandwiches and fries... So amazing! It was $22 for a small pizza, cheese fries, and a whole chicken sandwich. My BF and I split it, and had a ton left over. Which isn't bad at all considering the portions.   It's a dive type of place with a bar. You can eat in or take out. It's a very random place in Greenfield, but the food was so delicious! They have a menu on their website too!"}
{"text":"We came to Big Jim's after going to The Carnegie Museum.  The place isn't much to look at from the inside or the outside but the food was just as good as everybody says it is.  We split a pizza, which was pretty good, but nothing special.  I ate a chicken parm hoagie, which was really good.  The bread, chicken, cheese, and sauce were all great.  Onion rings were also decent.  Come hungry to this place, no chance you will leave hungry."}
{"text":"Really Guy? You endorsed this place on Triple D? You put your reputation on the line and did a segment on Big Jim's? I wasn't impressed with the food at all. The service was worse.                                 I ordered a half veggie hoagy and a bowl of vegetable soup. My friend Ross ordered a small pizza and a bowl of wedding soup. I was sipping on a pretty good Rooney pale ale which was the best part of the meal. A little while later our soup came in cups. We told the bartender we ordered bowls. Oops. I was fighting a cold and a nice hot bowl of vegetable soup would hit the spot. Still waiting for the soup, out came the pizza, looked good, tons of cheese and pepperoni, and my veggie hoagy.  My order was wrong again, I ordered a half and they gave me a whole Hoagy. No biggie, I'll take the other half home for a midnight snack. Still no sign of the soup! It was a pretty unremarkable hoagy. Lots of flavorless lettuce, green peppers, onion, and huge unchewable chunks of carrots, and worse, it was cold. I Was kind of hoping for some eggplant, roasted red peppers, grilled zucchini, you know a real veggie hoagy with some flavor and texture. Oh we'll, live and learn. Still no soup! Finally the bartender was finished watching TV and saw we were both out of beer, and I asked about the soup, he apologized and said he forgot. I said to Ross, I guess he must make a good hourly wage because he's not working for a good tip. Finally our soup was delivered and I pushed away that lousy hoagy and dived into soup. I blew on the spoonful of soup and Ross said \"you don't have to do that, it's cold.\" Damn! With a half eaten hoagy and a full bowl of soup sitting there, I asked for the check and paid and left. Never again Big Jim, never again! Guy, you lost points on this call."}
{"text":"Came here on my wife's whim, will be coming back for sure.   We started with the eggplant parm appetizer and when it came out I thought it was mistakenly an entree. Nope it is just huge! And delicious.   I got the large fish sandwich which is not a misnomer. Two giant fillets on a bun, I didn't even make it to the bun before I was full!!!   The staff was great, nice little atmosphere and for the price I do not think you can beat the portions anywhere in the city."}
{"text":"Absolutely homestyle cooking at its best. I'm not talking about the homestyle that chain places like to throw at us. I'm talking about old school, grandma's house, portions that would feed a small family, homestyle. I've tried several things off the menu over the years but always go back to that chicken parm sandwich. Damn is it good! And guess what? It's filling too. I can squeeze three meals out of it if I pace myself. Let's talk about the decor...it's so tacky that it's awesome. Kitschy, gaudy, lovely. It's an experience to behold. Have out of town guests visiting? This is an adventure they'll never forget and they'll thank you for it."}
{"text":"In a weird corner of the world is Big Jim's. Kind of conveniently located off the far end of the Jail Trail bike path, it's a delicious place to take a sandwich and beer break on your healthy lifestyle quest. :)   On my list for destination places for a good fish sandwich in Pittsburgh, I think all of their sandwiches are just as good and don't think you can go wrong with most items on their menu. I love their gravy too on sandwiches, mashed potatoes and fries.   I like their Italian wedding soup, their giant meatballs served with spaghetti or bun, their warm and cozy open faced roast beef sandwich, and their big cold cheap pitchers of beer. I have never ever regretted a trip to Big Jim's.   It's a nothing fancy place with good food and big portions. I think you get extra points for finding your way there. Just found out Guy Fieri from that food show filmed at Big Jim's on a Pittsburgh trip and put them on the foodie radar. Must be good, right? Ha ha."}
{"text":"A great Pittsburgh classic with the best Italian wedding soup around.  This is the real food scene in hometown Pittsburgh.  Really decent portions of the best red sauce pasta found between New York and San Francisco. Worth the trip back to the 'Burgh from our new desert home in Baja Arizona.  Tucson has got NOTHING like this place for quality and value."}
{"text":"Im a fan, my brother and I had sandwiches, big Jim's reuben. This monster sandwich is every bit what you want. Authentic, divey, tasty, grilled to perfection. Take it home and save it for later.  Get on board at Jims"}
{"text":"We went around lunchtime, but it wasn't very busy. Service was relatively quick and attentive. The waitress didn't mind that I was using my iPhone at the table, either. She also complemented me on the jersey I was wearing - of course, we were both wearing Crosby jerseys!   I had a full meatball hoagie. It was delicious. The cheese was oozing onto the plate, the meatballs were tasty and the meat sauce on it was great. Someone mentioned an odd taste to it - I think it's the pork that's in the meat sauce. My girlfriend got a full chicken parm as well. I gave that a taste and the chicken was almost better than the meatballs! It was excellent. I highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Delicious food. The portions are huge!! My husband had the meatball sub and raved the entire time he was eating it. We also had the Reuben, Roast Beef au jus, and chicken cordon Bleu sandwich."}
{"text":"First off, regardless of the stars you see here, make sure you know what type of place this is.  It is very much a DIVE/BAR, set in a residential area, and very easy to miss.  The food is decent, but nothing to write home about.  If you are of the mindset that large amounts of so-so tasting food at cheap prices = great place, then you will love it here.  Probably not a place to take a first date - unless she is dressed in a Steeler's jersey."}
{"text":"We went here, encouraged by the reviews on yelp. Definitely not disappointed. Got take out, but had to wait around 40 min for our order.. So make sure you call in if you're planning on take out.  Tried the reuben sandwich and it was pretty good... one of the best I've tasted in Pittsburgh. My wife got the lasagne and she liked it. The serving size is HUGE.. Will easily last for more than 1 meal.  Definitely coming back here to try other stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"It's not a Diner, It's not a Drive-In..... Big Jim's would need sprucing up to be a Dive! If you saw this place on TV (and let's face it, that's the only way anybody from outside this secret hideaway neighborhood would find this place) keep your TV romantic notions about it and stay home.  We did have the things they featured on the DDD show and they were (looking for a kind word here) ....awful.  The Italian Wedding Soup (normally a favorite of mine) had mystery meat and an over-abundance of salt. The Veal Parmigana Sandwich looked so obscenely large that we opted for the Veal Parmigana Plate with spaghetti.  They certainly give you quantity over quality here.  The Veal was pounded so thin, and then fried long enough to come out resembling two soles of a lost pair of shoes, and harder to chew.  The pasta was overcooked (but plenty of it!) with a bland tomato sauce that seemed canned (I know, the TV shows them making it from scratch).  They packed the place for the TV show, but you'll have no trouble getting a table.  We sat by the bar, so there was an abundance of TV and butt-crack visible from our table.  The pizza my partner had is about the only passable thing there was to eat here.  This place is so far out of the way, and so hard to find that our GPS threw a tantrum.  It was a huge disappointment, and I blame Fieri for that."}
{"text":"Big Jim's on the Run. What to say about this place. Well it was on Dinners Drive-ins and Dives and I thought it was just OK. Sure you can order a huge double decker veal parmesan but it was just OK.   The sandwich was served on a half loaf and it was toasted so it was hard as a rock and had to be smashed down causing a plate full of crumbs and crusty bits.   The restaurant is nothing more than a dirty outdated dive bar with sloppy looking employees that don't wear any type of uniform or matching clothing. It's hard to tell who works there and who is just someone trying to get a meal.   I don't mean to be hating but I went there once and haven't really wanted or felt the need to go back. So 3 stars for delivering something good but over all the large portions and TV fame wasn't enough to get me back in the door a second time."}
{"text":"There are a million places that serve food like this in Pittsburgh. The thing that sets Big Jim's apart is that it tastes reeeeeeel good and they give you ALOT of food.  One thing food places similar to Big Jim's does to offset the mediocre food is the portion, in the run the food tastes better and the portions set the bar again.   The calzone is a large supreme pizza folded in half. It typically takes me 3 meals to complete it. The Reuben is solid, big thick and flavorful as the toppings overflow the sides of the marble rye bread. The burgers, I feel are a little lacking, but they offer a black bean burger. The eggplant parm appetizer is easily a filling meal for one person."}
