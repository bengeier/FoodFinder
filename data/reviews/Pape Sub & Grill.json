{"text":"Hidden gem!  The food is fantastic and you can tell the Greek guy behind the counter loves his job! 10/10"}
{"text":"Love the burgers and subs here. Oh and the poutine! The owner (who is the only person I've ever seen working) always puts lots of gravy to ensure the cheese melts. And the gravy is actually hot enough to melt the cheese unlike the majority of places I've been.  The only issue I have is that he sometimes does not wash his hands before putting toppings on the food...I've watched him give a rinse but it's not thorough and he doesn't wear gloves. I would suggest asking him nicely to wash up if you see this, it would be a shame to miss out on the great food."}
{"text":"Ok what's with all the 5 star reviews for this place? It's just a little take out place. Anyways, I had the 5 dollar sub and it was good. It wasn't a 5 star sub because it was just a regular sub at a regular place. The other food is fine as well. If you want to fill up with normal food at decent prices then come here. Relax with the 5 stars people."}
{"text":"Great subs.  Independent shop with some Greek alternatives for the sub.  Very nice bread, great cold cuts.  Parking out front."}
{"text":"How has no one reviewed this place yet?! This place is easy to miss because its in a dumpy plaza across the street from mcdonalds on pape.   If you love sandwiches check the place out.  The rib sub and assorted sub are both damn tasty, fresh veggies and tasty meat.  But the best sandwich is the AAA  striploin steak sub, the quality of the steak is honestly better than some dine in restaurants where you pay $20 for a lackluster cut.  It's well seasoned and is to die for with the hot peppers, hot sauce, steak sauce combo.    The thing I like about this place the most is how attentively the owner/operator makes the subs.  He doesn't just throw toppings on like someone working at mr.sub or subway does. He prepares it as if it were his own.  Support the local sub guy!"}
{"text":"The other reviews say it all, owner run and maintained. He must have some type of hookup with his butcher because any meat you get is a+"}
