{"text":"Tried this place a couple of times, since they're a few minutes away from home and close to the dog park.  Unfortunately, the food was borderline inedible each time.  I would recommend avoiding this place, or walking up a block east for Chew Chew's Diner."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall that's good for some fairly quick good eats. Word on the street is the teriyaki dishes are your best bet. Its less then five bucks and pretty tasty so I would agree. The place is covered in orange linoleum and the menu is written in magic marker just to give you an idea of what kind of place it is. They also have a pretty decent and cheap breakfast selection but this has yet to be tested so can't comment on the quality."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place to sit down and have a coffee and sandwich. I think this is for breakfast and lunch. They close early. I ordered teriyaki. It was $5.25 with some lettuce salad and rice. I recommend this place because it's casual and fast and yet you can hang out especially if you are alone. The portion was big but I get hungry after I ate. I don't know why. You will like it as a breakfast & lunch. Sandwiches are like 2 dollar something."}
{"text":"I live in the attached building and have eaten here a number of times.  It's a prefect place to grab a quick bite if I don't feel like cooking or don't have time.  It's a small mom and pop operation, and I love supporting the little guy.  They have a combination of traditional American dishes as well as some Asian ones, as the owners are Asian.  I'm half Asian, so I love the home cooking.  

The food is incredibly cheap and tastes pretty good.  I love their chicken burgers and onion rings.  If you're going to get a cheeseburger, however, I would advise to just put your own on if you're getting takeout because they used processed cheese slices.  I keep meaning to try the teryaki because it's super cheap and comes with a lot of food.  Next time.  

The hours are a little odd.  They don't have a sign, so you don't really know when they open or close.  I would love to grab breakfast there one morning before work, but I've never seen them open before I go to work (often around 8:30/9am).  They close pretty early for dinner as well, but it always varies.  I have gone down for a bite not long after 6pm and they were already closed."}
