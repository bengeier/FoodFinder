{"text":"This place needs some work. The service was pretty slow (two tables in the restaurant yet it took ten minutes for our drink order). I had the quarter chicken and there were 1-2 hot pieces and the rest was lukewarm. My boyfriend had the Texas brisket sandwich and there were a lot of fatty pieces he had to cut off. I do like to support local businesses so hopefully they will get their act together."}
{"text":"I found the people here nice and super friendly but the menu needs some work.  Found the brisket was a little too fatty and the mashed potatoes were a little bland and lacked any real flavour. Pulled pork was solid though. Had a few of my wife's fries and they were also pretty good. They are starting out and I am happy there is something like this in my hood so I will give it another try."}
{"text":"Update - It has been 10 days and still no word from Sandoozles on their website or social media about re-opening. People have commented asking questions, but the Sandoozles team has suddenly gone MIA on social media.   At this point, not sure if they will re-open. I have been in contact with groupon and I suggest others do the same if they are worried about losing money on this \"deal\"."}
{"text":"This is a sorry excuse for BBQ - they better get a chef before they are out of business  - hamburger buns for sandwiches with shredded lettuce - had the charcoal coated brisket sandwich ($7) with fries ($5) - best thing was the beer - coleslaw not bad.  Update Regarding the \"Chef's\" comments:  First, I can't think of anyone in the world who was called their middle name for their entire life but also have an email address (used to sign up for Yelp) with their legal name.    Second, I came to your eatery with an appetite and expecting good BBQ - no chip on my shoulder.   Third, I was never concerned about the prices except that the brisket sandwich (the meat was grey in colour, lacking smoke, covered in flakey charcoal) with 4 small slices of meat (two of which were 80% fat)  served on a sesame topped Hamburger bun ( a little stale) with shredded lettuce (really McDonald's style lettuce in BBQ???)  was $7 and adding fries was $5. My point was put more meat and charge $10 for the sandwich might be better. And how about a real bun?  Fourth, 99% satisfaction - Really??? You have one good, one average, and one bad review on Yelp."}
{"text":"Not really a traditional BBQ place or a Deli for that matter even though the menu may have you thinking that it's a bit of both but still a great place to have in the neighborhood."}
