{"text":"Delicious!!! This place always smells good! The pressed sandwiches are really good and the muffins are great!!! The earl grey muffin, coffee cake muffin and blueberry muffins are my favorites. Good coffee with a large selection of sugars and sweeteners. Everyone should stop in here for a bite, it's bright, clean and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Tres Bon latte et flexibilité au niveau des choix de menus et portion. A découvrir car emplacement caché."}
{"text":"So far I really love going to this place. Their coffee is delicious. Lattes made with your choice of a very wide variety of milks (Almond, Soy, dairy-skim, dairy whole). When I asked if they had 2% they offered to give me half skim and half whole!  The staff there are very friendly and upon return visits, they even remembered how I liked my latte. I was also impressed with the variety of sweeteners they offered, including honey, agave, and stevia...  The muffins are awesome. I've had the banana and the raspberry. I think it may be safe to say the raspberry muffin is the best muffin I've ever had.  I have not tried any of the other food. They offer a limited selection of salads and sandwiches (about 4 of each) that I believe changes daily. It looks fresh and appealing. They had 1 salad and 1 sandwich offering that was vegetarian. They seemed a little on the un inspired side, but not bad.  On the down side it the latte feels a wee bit pricey, but considering large chain coffee shops don't charge much less for something that's not as good... You get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"This review is based totally on a latte and pistachio croissant, which I feel is pretty irresponsible of me, since their main business is lunch food and catering and I did not eat any of those things.  Anyway, based on the aforementioned petit dej, I would give four stars. The croissant was out of this world, and the latte was super rich. The service was really friendly, which I always appreciate, (I'm never moving back to the Plateau. Ever. People are so nice down here, I feel like I'm back in Atlanta.) In fact, the gal at the cash actually double checked with me about whether I wanted my latte decaf (hi, that would be me, the enormous pregnant lady) which was really considerate.  It's not the greatest place to sit and stay awhile, but there is some seating in the form of a bar looking out through some big windows.  Would not have walked here unless Cafe Bloom had been closed, but I'm certainly glad I did, and I'll be back for lunch."}
{"text":"VRAIMENT délicieux. Ce service de traiteur a un petit café super mignon surtout populaire pour ses lunchs à emporter. Ils font de délicieuses salades autour de 11-12$ et des sandwichs à tomber par terre (mon préféré : poulet, aïoli, et brie, ou encore rôti de boeuf) autour de 8$. Je prends souvent le combo sandwich/soupe/breuvage, ce qui me revient à 11$ et qui me satisfait oh combien beaucoup!   L'été il font des soupes froides, telles que la délicieuse pommes/jalapeno/menthe.  La salade de kale, canneberge, saumon laqué et fromage de chèvre fait un tabac à mon bureau! Si vous travaillez dans le coin, je vous recommande chaudement cet endroit pour le lunch!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place! Perfect for a quick bite to eat on my lunch break during work :) The staff is amazing and friendly! They are always on point! I usually always get a salad when I go to eat there ( I love the variety). But I have to say my favourite (which I highly recommend) is the salmon & kale salad...so delicious! I am always happy when a get a chance to eat there! Makes my day a bit brighter! So if you are in the griffintown area definently give this place a try! I promise you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Although famous for their wonderful food and catering, M.A.D. is an underrated gem in the St-Henri/Griffintown coffee scene. The staff is delightful and genuine, offering amazing beverages (try the macchiato and chai latte!) and unmatched customer service. I had asked if lemonade was on the menu one morning, instead of saying no (it wasn't on the menu) they made the drink from scratch, squeezing lemons and adding fresh mint leaves! You have to experience it to believe it!"}
{"text":"I like their lunch special: a sandwich, a soup, and a beverage. Both the sandwich and the soup are delicious - and I believe you can substitute soup with salad. The place is small so there isn't much seating. However, most people take their meals to go so I've never had a problem finding a place to sit, relax, read, and eat here!"}
{"text":"While I was in Montreal, this spot became my regular coffee shop.  They pull a nice latte, and the staff is very friendly."}
