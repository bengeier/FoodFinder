{"text":"This is my favourite brunch spot in Montreal! Everything Sabine (the owner and chef) makes is AMAZING! I take the Renaud every time I go - crepe with brie, apples, and maple syrup. The soups are all great as well. I suggest this place any time my friends ask to go to brunch, and they have all been extremely pleased with the service and food. They also have frozen meals available for take out. I recommend the soups and the pies (only because I haven't tried the other things yet!)."}
{"text":"Let me preface the review by declaring my love for the Fleury West neighborhood in Ahuntsic.  The streets are peaceful,  lots of trees and beautiful homes. Pretty close to central streets too.  There is a Parc nearby to enjoy a latte or just to take in area.  The prices are pretty reasonable but I have to try some of their other offerings.  Most surprised to find the apple muffin was still good 3 days later after I forgot it in the car."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem. Brought here by a French colleague for lunch so you know this is truely authentic. Food is awesome. Definitely recommend!  The only issue, not sure if it was just that day with some problem to their fan, the place was filled with smoke and we all stink the rest of the afternoon..."}
{"text":"Great homemade crepes both salty and sweet. Very cosy with a terrasse in the summer its a ideal for breakfast or lunch. Don't miss it if you're in the area!"}
