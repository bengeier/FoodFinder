{"text":"The service certainly isn't much (non-existent actually)--we did not receive any sort of acknowledgement walking in. I can't rate the food because we couldn't even order since there was no chef in. I might still pay the place another visit."}
{"text":"It's a nice hidden gem around streetsville. The food is mediocre and the interior of the place is really pretty. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because they couldn't give more drinks due to their machine which was broken down. I mean it was a Saturday; good way to make sales but I guess it happens. Anyways good job with the services provided, and oh forgot to mention, their sheesha is amazing! One of the best in mississauga!"}
{"text":"Had a great time, it's good for hangouts and groups, they have the best hookah in town, and delicious food with amazing service"}
{"text":"Honestly, I have never had better Middle Eastern food than this place. Their food and shisha are definitely exceptional. I always get the blue mist and it never disappoints. What was most amazing about it was that during the month of Ramadan, they had a full buffet and other special deals going on including a meal and shisha for a really good price. Their dessert is to die for, they have this thing called a chocolate bomb, and its AMAZING. What I like most about the place is the decor and that the owners come and check on you as well, it really shows that they care about their business. If you want good shisha and a wonderful meal, definitely visit!!"}
{"text":"Nice layout,  fast service, good food and reasonable prices. I realized they just had their grand opening yesterday after doing a major face lift."}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing, from the food to the atmosphere. I would highly recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place with my girlfriend, I am absolutely disappointed in this place. Ill start off with the positives: Good open seating, good sheesha, good people. Now Ill talk about the rest of my experience there. 3 Employees began fighting in the backroom, yelling, swearing, some talking bad about customers (\"the bitch ordered...\"). They turned the music off, so we can clearly hear what they were fighting about. When there is a service to be delivered, you deliver it, this place did not. I had to personally go back there to shut them up, pay my bill, and walk out. Secondly, they have a full menu, but when I asked for their Zad Burger, the server said they don't have any burgers, I then asked for CHICKEN SHAWARMA, which once again, they didn't have it (Chicken Shawarma at a sheesha lounge is like mandatory). This was a terrible experience. This place has a lot of potential, sadly."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Customer service is non existent, seriously. The staff are rude and incredibly inhospitable. I regret ever coming here. It's my 3rd time unfortunately and I refuse to ever step foot in this establishment nor let anyone else feel the misery of being served here. Food takes like 45 minutes to arrive, if you're assisted to begin with. Half the time, they don't have things on the menu. Seriously don't understand how this place still gets business. Beware."}
{"text":"Honestly, the WORST place I have ever been to. Pretty bad sheesha (never ever try the vanilla). We ordered food and 45 minutes we walked up to a server to check for our order...and guess what? They forgot to put it in. I've never been so disappointed. Mazaj and Haze are definitely x5383829292 better. Never coming here again. Stay clear of this place. Servers are absolutely inattentive... Do yourself a favour and save yourself the misery of coming here."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time and tried giving it a chance but everytime I have gone, they never have any sheesha flavours available. Their service is terrible and while the owner just stands around, there is only ever one person serving all tables. The only good thing about here is the mint tea."}
{"text":"Really Aweful place!   We went there for Iftar during month of Ramadan (muslim way of breaking the fasting)  They had a buffet dinner - which is why we selected this place as it is noce for these occasions to have a big variety of food.  The food was not tasty, and it finished soo fast and they didnt refill it. Our first round we put soo little food in our plates so we can come up and fill from the stuff we liked - besides the fact that we didnt like what we tasted - we went to fill in more food as we were still hungry - there was nothing left!!! My brother only ate a plate of fattoush salad and thats it for example...! I had some salad and a skewer of meet to try it and thats it....  At the end, we ate a lot of the dessert - honey balls - to feed our hunger!!  Ohh... and to be complete, i got a hair in the food....   Will never go back for sure."}
{"text":"General information:  have been this to place couple of times and every time i go there i find it closed. Even though it says that they close at 2AM online.  Oh but wait, here is the trick. It turns out that the front door of the store on the main street is for Zad banquet hall kind of thing which is always closed unless there is an event and the Zad shisha cafe is accessible  from the back. So you literally have to drive around the block to find the back door with no signs whatsoever indicating that they are open or that there is a backdoor. Its really tricky and i find it extremely ridiculous that the owners of that place didnt use a beautiful main street they are on to drive people in to their store rather than just depending on word of mouth of their regulars.  Now lets talk about the experience we had since we walked in.  Interior and environment: ****  When you go in you have to go downstairs to the basement and that is where the shisha cafe is.  Its a very clean place but the environment and the interior looks more like a furniture store rather than a shisha cafe. They have really put their money and effort to design such a place but at the end of the day its still a basement.  Service: **  There was only one server when we arrived and he was trying to catch up with all of the tables there.  Staff there are nice but yet unprofessional in the way they serve food and take orders.  Shisha: ****  I would say the shisha was pretty good and clean. I have ordered grapemint and got exactly what i asked for. The clouds were thick and the flavour was there.  Food: **  Biggest issue was that they ran out of alot of the items on the menu on that day. They didnt have chicken shawarma, beef shawarma, hummus with chicken, hummus with beef , and cheese sambosak.   So me and my friend had to order the following dishes:  1) kebbeh stuffed with beef **  2) hummus *  3) chicken escalope ****  Kebbeh was too oily , the hummus was canned , and the escalope was delicious.  Pricing: ****  Moderate. Items are worth the price if they just focus more on improving service and stocking up on the items they have on their menu.  Washrooms: *****  Super clean and well taken care of. The interior looks modern and nice too.  Conclusion:  I  would give this place 3 stars if they had their sign to be more clear and not as tricky. There is alot of nice shisha places in Mississauga  and Oakville.   Date of the visit: Sep 15 Friday Time of the visit: 10:45 PM"}
{"text":"Me and a couple of friends went to Zad cafe yesterday night. This was my third night going there since the majority of my friends don't like going there already for the shisha. However, after going the first time I persuaded them to come along. I told them the shisha is not too bad and the food is alright.   When we reached Zad, I was surprised to see that it was not at all packed for a Saturday night. At the time we went, all other shisha cafes are usually jam packed at full capacity with line ups. We sat down and were able to get the couch area because there was no one there. We all ordered our shishas, drinks and food.   One of our friends ordered Gum/Mint and when it arrived it was actually just Mint. I forgot to tell him that I ordered Watermelon/Mint last time and it was only Mint even though they \"fixed\" it. They brought him a Grape/Mint instead. I had ordered the cheese melt fries and they completely forgot to bring them.  I found it really annoying that I had to walk over to the other side of the cafe to inform them if I wanted anything. No one actually came around even when we wanted to order. Their service was extremely slow. There was basically one person serving for the entire cafe and never actually wrote the orders down so she kept forgetting the orders. When one of my friends advised the waitress that there was no soap in the men's washroom she replied by saying \"I am not in charge of the male washroom and sarcastically responded yes, like it is my number one priority to place soap in the washroom right?\".  We were all shocked by her response!  After some time I had decided to go to the washroom myself and on my way started talking to another group on a different table regarding the cheese melt fries. I joked about how great the fries look and asked if I could try one. The people laughed and offered me to try them. I tried one fry and told them how delicious it is and continued walking towards the washroom. As soon as I came out of the washroom the owner named Hassan was standing there. He approached me and advised me that \"he did not like what he saw back there and never wants that to occur in his restaurant again.\" I was quite shocked and asked him what did I do? According to the owner it was quite rude of me to talk to complete strangers on another table and ask for their fries. I assured him that the people on that table did not have any problem or issues with me trying one of their fries. I took him to the table and asked if the people had any issues or thought I was rude in any way. The customers re-assured the owner Hassan that they had not the slightest issue and everything was fine. In fact by the look on their face they were quite shocked and surprised as to why Hassan had decided to make an issue out of it in the first place.   Even still, Hassan continued to advise me that \"this is how it is in my restaurant, if you don't like it you can leave.\" Again, while maintaining self-control , I asked him why he was offended if people are trying to socialize in his cafe. His response was that they may think that you are rude but they may not be telling you and thus they will never come to my restaurant again.  I advised Hassan that I will not be coming to his restaurant again and will be writing a review on any platform I can find. I have a network of about 50 avid shisha goers (we go everyday) and will be advising all of them to never attend Zad lounge."}
{"text":"Went there for a family lunch ! And what a big mistake and waste of time it was . So let me break this down to u : -parking : if you are planning to go there on a weekend or when there is a soccer match \"like premier league , Spanish liga etc... \" forget about finding a parking spot near the restaurant -no menu outside describing the prices or the dishes srviced  -service: servers don't wear uniforms so we can know who is serving us  The server girl had a broken wrist with bandages and plater and everything  She threw the menu down to us and didn't even bother to greet us with a smile or a simple greeting  There is another guy who rolled his eyes at us when he saw us  -I didn't see any one or any commotion at the cooking area honestly. Needless to say we got out and went to sq1/to have a meal @ Amyana  This was worst service anywhere and I went to downtown."}
{"text":"HORRRIBLE SERVICE !!!!! and they lie about their  hours of operations .The owner is very rude he told us downstairs was closed ,then a family walked in of Arab decent and he literally walked them downstairs while I can clearly see it from the parking lot .Is because we are black sir ?????"}
