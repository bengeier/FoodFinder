{"text":"Not su good (pun intended!). Portions are large but what good does that do when the rice is undercooked, chicken tastes anything but, and their beef looks and smells stale?! I tried this place a couple of times to make sure I give it a fair rating. I will not return and definitely do not recommend unless you are in the neighborhood, a hurricane destroyed all other restaurants in your vicinity, and you are starving and have to get some food, any food, in your body. Unfortunately, Total fail for me and the hubby despite their excellent customer service :("}
{"text":"Purchased a general tso chicken and the chicken was amazing and even crispy! 
Walked into the place, the vibe is similar to many other Chinese restaurants but this one by far had the best chicken !"}
{"text":"The food was okay, I didn't take a photo as it was delivery and I was starving so I ate it quick I can't rate the actual resto since I didn't go but the food itself was a 3. I've had better and I've had worse. Nothing all that special, I ordered corn crab soup as well and not sure if it's just because it was delivery but it didn't taste like typical corn soup. The meat was also very very fatty"}
{"text":"First time here.  Ordered a couple of spring rolls, General Tso chicken and Singapore noodles to go.
It was much better than I expected.  Staff were friendly and I waited for my food where I could watch the kitchen. 
They were very busy in the kitchen. They also very clean. 
Recommend with no reservation"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have only had takeout from Su-good including Yeung chow fried rice and Szechuan beef. The foods are served in plastic microwavable containers, which can be kept and re-use afterwards compared to the usual white take away boxes from other restaurants. The portion is quite filling and the boxes are filled right to top. 

Their Yeung chow fried rice is a bit different from what I've had other places; it was more of a regular fried rice, but it was good! My boyfriend had the Szechuan beef and he liked it as well. These two are our favourite foods there. We've also had chicken fried rice, tofu, and fried noodle which were okay.. Plus, they give you soy sauce packets. 

Service is okay, like other chinese places. Waiting time is medium, neither quick nor slow."}
{"text":"My fave. Their General Tao is amazing. I have never had anything bad from here  and they always heat up nicely the next day and don't taste stale, quality veggies, nice and crisp. Their combos are great.

Never been to the location, but we have been ordering for some 3 years now and it's consistent. A bit on the higher price end, but worth it."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall but man this  place Suuu Good. I told my buddies to meet me here and they weren't sure if was the right spot coz it's so sketchy.  Very authentic coz they make the Cantonese chow mein suuu good. My buddies were so pleased and full coz the price and portions are amazing. Ordered Cantonese chow mein, deep fried pork chop, general tao chicken, shrimps and fried rice and finished everything. Always friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food is decent here. Have dined in and done take out a few times. Staff are super nice and friendly, which makes this place inviting. Have ordered Cantonese chow mein, special chicken fried rice, mixed vegetable with cashew nut and shrimp with mixed vegetables. Portions are huge, enough to share or keep leftovers for following day. Space is clean, including washrooms."}
