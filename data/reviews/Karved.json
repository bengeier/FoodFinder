{"text":"Was looking for something off the strip to avoid the crowds and found Karved on Yelp.  The food was excellent and reasonably priced.  Owner and staff were nice and made our visit very enjoyable... so much so, we ate there another time before we left town.  We'll eat there again when we're back."}
{"text":"REAL. GREAT. FOOD. Everything was absolutely amazing, and the staff was so friendly.  We will definitely be back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"GO THERE!!!, my wife and I stopped by after Targets and it was empty and I don't know why? The food was awesome and the owners were fantastic. We both got combination plates, tri-tip and chicken and every bite was delicious. Very flavorful and filling. The combination plates were about $15 and very good value for money. I hope they catch on because it's just too good an experience to not have customers all the time."}
{"text":"This is my second time here getting takeout at Karved and I'm never disappointed. The porchetta sandwich may be one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, and certainly on of the best in Vegas. I dream about the lemony flavor with the perfect balance of tenderness and crunch from the pork loin wrapped in crispy pork belly. Yummmm!!  Their fries are great, tri tip is awesome, tasty sauces, delicious soup. Come here and support local businesses! You won't be sorry, and the staff is so lovely."}
{"text":"Was in the area and wanted some quick to eat. Saw the yelp photos and thought to give it a try... so glad I did. The sandwiches are super tasty. We had the tri-tip and porchetta which was really really good. The bread was soft and fresh. We also sampled the soup which would be great on a cold day. Not close to where I live but definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I was in the area and hungry, so I went to Karved based on the great Yelp reviews. Wow! What a cool place!  I have Celiac and can't eat gluten (wheat). I could tell they aren't used to dealing with that, but they did fine.  I got a bowl with rice, beans, peppers, corn, and steak. I got two side sauces: garlic (only average) and something with cilantro (excellent!). I was really surprised by how flavorful each ingredient was!  The lady who helped me was extraordinarily friendly.  Unrelated to the food: the bar stools are super cool! I took a pic, because I want them for my kitchen counter bar.  Great experience! I will definitely return when I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Had a quick dinner with my nieces and daughter sisters. Fantastic food and service. Between us we tried the tri-tip, roasted chicken, salad, sandwiches and dinner plates. All of the sides were fresh and perfectly cooked. The meat was tender and flavorful. Super friendly and helpful staff who checked on us throughout the meal. Reasonably priced and great for all ages."}
{"text":"Since the Grand Opening in October 2017, Karved has gained a significant rise in popularity for their gourmet rotisserie. They serve roasted beef tri-tip, porchetta, rotisserie chicken, and all beef hot dog. The most requested items are their tri-tip and porchetta karved sandwich. In addition, they have salad, soup, vegetarian pita wrap, elote corn, homemade karved sauces, and a delighful frozen greek yogurt that is sprinkled with baklava crumble. The menu is designed over a brown parchment with simplicity. Given how the interior space is so clean and polished, you will feel like a welcomed guest at their table served with the greatest hospitality and the best kind of freshly homemade, family meal.  I ordered the Karved Plate with 1/2 Roasted Chicken ($14) which includes Basmati Rice, Pita Bread, a choice of 2 sides: Brussel Sprouts and Roasted Potatoes, and a choice of one sauce: the Garlic Sauce. The half rotisserie chicken is delivered hot, it has a well-seasoned crispy skin and juicy meat, and is served over a good amount of basmati rice. The fork-tendered roasted red potatoes and brussel sprouts are nicely cooked. What won me over is the soft pita bread and that creamy garlic sauce that is made with olive oil and garlic. The garlic sauce is perfectly whipped to perfection which makes it taste so good and deliciously buttery.  Now at the time I was waiting for my meal, they offer if I would like to try a sample of their soup. I chose the Cilantro Chicken and this particular soup makes me want to order a big bowl of it. The ingredients are made simple. It has diced carrot, green peas, kernel corn, shreds of rotisserie chicken, basmati rice, and chopped scallions. The soup is not bland or salty. And what makes this soup so flavorful is in the broth. It really does taste like it is homecooked. What exceeds my expectation is seeing how service is made personable. They come by to each table, kindly greeting and giving one-on-one attention to the customer. Every person is treated as a special guest in their home. They make you feel like you are already part of their family."}
{"text":"This is definitely going to be my go to place if I'm craving meat. Their chicken is seasoned very well and the atmosphere is nice and cozy. Bring your friends here for a nice brunch or lunch date."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  Came here a bunch of times, ordered a bunch of food, and everything was really good.  Porchetta sandwich was really good. It came with a good amount of pork, and the pork was cooked really well. They also use a really good bread.  My favorite was the Karved French Dip. The beef was juicy and I liked the caramelized onions that came with it. Almost had like a barbeque flavor to it. Was very nice.  Definitely gotta try the pita chips. They are warm and soft. The hummus that came with it was really well made.  Service was really good. The interior is really clean, it's nice that there is an open kitchen. I liked it a lot. Definitely a good place to get some food."}
{"text":"Honestly, one of my favorite meat spots in Vegas. The staff is uber friendly, the menu is on the wall and accessible, and the vibe in the store is dope.  Next, the food. The tri tip is super tender. Great seasoning. They gave us three sauces. Honestly, the best out of the sauces was the garlic butter. How do you not like garlic butter? The chicken is super juicy and well seasoned. The Brussel sprouts are nicely made: great texture, lightly salted. The peppers were very nice. Great addition to the steak and butter. I wish they had a short grain rice option because I like a stickier feel but the long grain rice was very well made. My favorite part was the frozen yogurt and baklava. Nice amounts of creamy, sweet, sour, and crunchy.  Super nice service, super nice food. Will eat again.  Edit: I forgot... get the porchetta. It was described as an Italian Lechon. It was amazeballs. Crunchy, savory, and we'll sauced. Get that"}
{"text":"My wife and stopped in for lunch after a long drive from so Cal. What a find ! The food was fantastic. The staff was very friendly but the food wow! If you are looking for a great place to eat this is it"}
{"text":"Visited this place while in Vegas ended up eating here twice. Food is delicious. Had the rotisserie chicken and tri tip both were great as well as all the sides. Second visit had the porkcheta sandwich which has outstanding. My friend had the vegetarian wrap which she said was great. Make sure you try the soup both were so good! The staff is over the top friendly as well. Karved is a must visit while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The tri tip sandwich was out of this world! The meat was perfectly cooked and the caramelized onions were so delicious! Great atmosphere in a little out of the way location. Decided to try it because the line for Sakana was way too long. Definitely glad I did! Will make Karved the point of my next trip for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had with some of the best service I've experienced. I don't review on here often, but this place definitely deserved 5 stars. If you're looking to support an honest business with delicious food, look no further. Thank you, Paul!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat when i go to vegas. We tried just about everything on the menu and we love every single thing. The customer service is extremely warm and attend to your every need. My top favorite is the chicken cilantro soup and the corn on the cob. My boyfriends favorite was the soup and tri-tip he said it was to die for. You will not be disappointed.  P.s  lm excited to be going back tomorrow im already picturing everything i will eat."}
{"text":"Yes, five stars. I went in on Wednesday for lunch, came back on Thursday for dinner, and I'm still trying to figure out how I can go back again ASAP. The location is cute and clean, the service is engaging and informative, and the food is tasty and fresh!  They're marketed as a rotisserie, and their chicken plates are a highlight, but I have so far stuck to their sandwiches.  The porchetta is amazing, hearty and juicy with a nice crispy skin for contrast, piled on a hearty artisan roll with arugula, parsley gremolata, and a lemon sauce. It was a fantastic lunch, and I didn't eat for the rest of the day because I was so full.  The tri-tip sandwich was also tasty, with a heap of caramelized onions and a really great garlic sauce for kick. This paired well with their fries, and again, it was a humongous portion. They have seasonal soups; I preferred the beef over the chicken. Their warm and chewy pita chips are my favorite version I've come across; the $4 portion with creamy hummus is huge enough to be a meal in itself.  Both visits have treated me to lots of staff interaction, from answering my annoying questions about the food to trying samples of other dishes and getting detailed info about their menu and concept. Everyone here is very friendly and everything is made fresh in house, from the sauces to the breads and everything in between. Looking forward to coming back for their chicken pita next time!  EDIT: Returned for the chicken pita! It was bomb, and so healthy too. The green goddess dressing is delicious, they really do have amazing sauces here. Sided my order with the the Brussels sprouts, which are nearly the size of golf balls, and lightly roasted and seasoned. Perfection again!"}
{"text":"TRY THIS PLACE NOW!!!!!!!  A absolutely fabulous. The best food I've had in a long time.  You won't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"Found the greatest restaurant today! The minute I walked through the door I was greeted and had menu  options explained to me. I tried a tri tip sandwich with onion marmalade and the chicken cilantro soup. The owner also had me sample porchetta with a dressing they make themselves. It was all fantastic! All the flavors were original and perfectly paired! I found my new favorite eatery-great service and awesome food! Welcome to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Tri tip is off the charts. Getting the beef/ chicken combo can feed 2 easily. Peruvian Spiced chicken. BBQ sauce is great. Awesome staff. Worth finding this place when you could eat for 2 under $20 bucks.  Sandwiches are rocking as well. Hidden secret by UNLV.  Hope they open in henderson."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and veggie bowl in clean, simple surroundings. Staff is friendly and helpful with questions about the menu. Just simple food done very, very well, and their horseradish sauce is spectacular!"}
{"text":"Wow! I love the Lebanese mixed with home country and Mexican style. The bowls are awesome, I was surprised how good they were. Veggie bowl is the go to with the elote Mexican corn and garlic sauce. It's a banger I always get and extra sauce. My girlfriend put me on to this place and I'm hooked. I've been without her a couple of times. The ambience is very welcoming like a house kitchen and the food fresh and hot. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The roasted chicken is amazing! The first time I was offered a sample of soup when I was waiting, but not the second time (not sure why). The staff was super - friendly and helpful both times. Really liked the Brussels sprouts and coke slaw as sides. The bbq sauce is also amazing. It's a really adorable space inside which you would not guess from its strip mall location. Everything comes on a tray with an Andes mint (nice touch!)"}
{"text":"Amazing new place,  you have to check it out.  There's an amazing little eatery with rotisserie meats and fabulous sides.  I stopped in for a little to go lunch and ordered the 1/4 chicken and a side of hummus and pita.  I opted out of getting the whole plate which includes two sides and rice, because I just wasn't that hungry. Had I been a little hungrier I would have gotten the whole thing.   The chicken was moist and delicious full of flavor, and roasted perfectly. My favorite were the pita chips homemade crunchy on the outside soft on the inside, paired with the hummus was unbelievable! I would stop in here just to get the pita and hummus haha.  The ambiance is cool and hip,  very relaxing,  and the service is excellent.  Great little spot."}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the free stuff!  I'll pay what I got for free any old time I'll pay what I got for free any old time  I say Love it!  Eat it! Love it!  Eat it! I'll pay what I got for free any old time I'll pay what I got for free any old time  I entered Karved on a scorching Wednesday It looked to us like a hipster café Two helpful servers were smiling away They took my order and then they did say How 'bout some samples of our soups of the day We took two cups 'cuz we were really hun-gray We slurped it down, our hunger pangs it did allay One of the best soups to this foodie sansei Chicken cilantro soup I could eat all day And it was nice it was free It was nice it was free  Then came the pita chips and hummus free too The chips were so hot, freshly made they did do I picked one up, to make it cool I blew Dipped it in hummus just a bit not through and through After my first bite, I did yell \"WOO-HOO!\" Best chips and hummus I've ever had, that's so true! The crunchy outside/soft inside was the chips' biggest virtue I gobbled them up quickly, my wife she did too And it was nice it was free And it was nice it was free  The stuff we paid for was not so exciting The tri-tip sandwich did look really inviting But the meat was salty tough, too thick they were slicing The bread was not a good choice, each time that I was biting Everything was falling out, so frustration it was inciting The Brussels sprouts were not roasted, so the look was not enticing  The ketchupped hot dog, however, my son he was delighting The black beans were flavorful, meat addition did some brightening  I say Love it!  Eat it! Love it!  Eat it! I'll pay what I got for free any old time I'll pay what I got for free any old time   I'll pay what I got for free any old time I'll pay what I got for free any old time   Don't be afraid of the free stuff!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! We were looking for a good spot before heading to the airport and Karved exceed my expectations! I had the pulled pork sandwich - sooo good! The pita chips and garlic sauce are also not to miss. Friendly staff and all the food is homemade. Don't miss this spot!"}
{"text":"Bonafide 5 stars--innovative dishes, quality across all the selections we ordered, great service, fresh decor and that hard-to-describe wow factor.  Everyone was so personable and customer-experience oriented.  On to the food.  Their twist on porchetta, rotisserie style, makes for a fabulous and savory filling in a large ciabatta roll. The amber cracklings added some snap to the generous sandwich, topped with peppery arugula tossed in seasoned olive oil. Listen up pork afficionados, Hawaiians and Filipino compatriots--if you love porchetta, lechon and roast pig, you will love this sandwich!  If your dream sandwich includes beef instead, prepare to be happy with their tender tri-tip. My hubby was made very happy with his choice. Let it be noted that he had to take home the remaining half of his sandwich because #1, we were given samples of their delicious spicy beef broth soup and chicken cilantro rice soup; and #2, we gorged ourselves on their hummazing hummus and hot fried pita triangles, in addition to herb seasoned french fries plus fry sauce (yay, a noteworthy resemblance to yummy Utah Greek diner fry sauces).  The owner, I believe (Minnesota man who also loves hockey) let us try their frozen, fresh yogurt made today by his wife.  Creamy, tangy and lemony flavored goodness, topped with crushed honey-soaked baklava.  WOW, I would stop in here just for that!  Who am I kidding? I would stop in here for nearly anything on their menu.  The only thing I would change is to move them closer to where we live!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! All I have to say. Try it now, you won't be disappointed. Tri tip sandwich and chicken pita were SO good! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I have ever had! The pork tastes just like what I had in Munich. You can't miss this if you're into crispy meet!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Staff is very friendly! Place is nice and clean! I mean what else could you ask for?? I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"Wanted sandwiches on the way through LV and this place didn't disappoint. Both the Porchetta and the salads were tasty. Staff was super attentive and the service was great. If you like a meaty sandwich this is your place."}
{"text":"The place was clean, the staff was so nice and friendly. We ordered the southwest chicken sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich.... they were both really good but the pulled pork was probably better *in my opinion* also they offered infused water to drink."}
{"text":"Great food. The chicken was very moist and the sides were all very good. The beef was very good as well.  The staff and the owners were really friendly.  Wish there was a Karved in Los Angeles. Great spot in Vegas, we will be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Wow.....this place is amazing! The food is delicious and juicy. They combine flavors that go so well together. The prices are reasonable for what you get. And the staff is so accommodating and help you out when you don't know what to order. This place is a gem and everyone should try it out. If you don't, you're missing out on foodie heaven."}
{"text":"So happy we found this place! The food is absolutely AMAZING, and the staff is so friendly! They took great care of us and made sure everything tasted great, and it definitely did. Highly recommend anything off of the menu, my favorites being the chicken pita wrap and both of the soups. I'll definitely be coming back here next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and I can say the beef never disappoints. Also the chicken has good flavor but may seem dry at times. The ahí verde sauce is great. I also like the chicken cilantro soup."}
{"text":"The place is New but had many good Reviews so my Friends and I decided to give it a try.. And Wow!!!! Everything gets an A+.. From their food, which is naturally Cooked there, (nothing frozen, and no added preservatives) to their Service.. PRISCILLA treated us with such a contagious positive Energy, that it made our dining experience much more pleasant!! Thank You Guys!! Will definitely come Back"}
{"text":"I discovered this place while doing delivery for Postmates and I was instantly intrigued. The staff that day were two younger women who seemed to very busy that Saturday morning so I decided I would come back later. I love community as much as food and didn't want it to taint my view.  Instead of going back I ordered on Postmates and had the Tri-Tip Sandwich. It was so different from any I had ever had before. Soft and savory in texture it was topped with a creamy garlic spread and caramelized onions.  I was so won over by the food that I started to frequent the restaurant. It is a small cafe style place with a minimalist design. I love the pristine white subway tiles and the butcher paper menus. The salt and pepper shakers are the cutest of all. I also appreciate the fact that the tables are fully and heavily lacquered. To many times I have gone into a place and the tables are sticky from years of cleaning solutions eating away at the wood.  I even got a complimentary desert from Paul, the owner when my wife began to suggest deserts on one earlier dinner date. He is very cool and fun and outgoing. Needless to say it satisfies my need for food and community."}
{"text":"My wife and I swung by here after a friend's retirement party. We missed out on the food there and were hungry. The Yelp reviews were off the chain, so I was excited. The staff IS amazing, as others note. The food was not. God bless them, I wanted to LOVE this place because I'm a sucker for a great sandwich. Didn't find any here. My wife ordered the chicken sandwich, which was just ok. It was pretty bland. She was so disappointed she made me try it so I would believe her. It wasn't great. I ordered the tri-tip, which was also meh. Just not a lot of flavor going on, the meat was overcooked and old tasting. The sides were nothing to write home about. I feel like apologizing for this review, but I'm just being honest. It was fine, we weren't hungry when we left, we loved the people, but the food doesn't hold up. Even Capriotti's is way better."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Great food, great service, simple menu, clean environment!!! Couldn't ask for anything more. You gotta check it out..."}
{"text":"Amazing costumer service and the food is phenomenal!! I'd definitely recommend visiting here to eat lunch"}
{"text":"This place! Food was so good that after having lunch here, I took a group back for dinner. Everyone was as pleased as I was. Food is flavorful, good choices, sides were great. The amount of food you get for the money spent was totally worth it.....it's actually extremely reasonable. They give you a free sample of their soup while you wait, which was Uber tasty!!! Family friendly, clean, and the staff including the owner are all good people....we WILL be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Eaten here several times. Always good, the food is always great and the staff have been super friendly. The tri-tip sandwich is excellent...it's tender and you don't pull all the meat out trying to bite through it. Quality food, good staff, fair price. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Y'all! Let me take a moment of silence for these french fries. Fried up golden crisp and well seasoned. I took one bite and the hallelujah chorus fired up in the back ground as the light and love from my grandma poured down from heaven.   This is a fantastic spot, with fantastic food, and even more fantastic people! The service is attentive, upbeat, and professional. I walked in and was immediately greeted and welcomed. As I expressed that it was my first time I received a sample of their soup of the day (DELICIOUS), and from there I began my ordering experience. Jacqueline, Jacqui, Jaq, and all the other nicknames we talked about people giving us, was fantastic at the register. She helped me decide on the chicken pita. She was upbeat, positive, knew the product, and really represented the brand well.   When my food arrived, THE PICKLED ONIONS WERE LIFE. I couldn't get enough. The taste was fantastic and it was well put together and a great portion size.   I highly recommend this spot as a lunch smash and grab. You will not  be disappointed, if you are, you need to reevaluate your own life choices as they have mostly been wrong."}
{"text":"Goodness i got the PORCHETTA. It was 12 dollars and it was EXCELLENT. THE BEST SANDWHICH IVE EVER HAD. The pork is juicy and the crackling outside was the texture that I enjoy. I enjoyed the greens that topped it and the spread inside the bread. WARNING. Its a messy sandwhich. Your hands will be drenched in grease. Some of the pork will fall out but ITS WORTH IT. Grab a fork and extra napkins!  I also asked if the 4 dollar FRIES were seasoned. They are!! They season them their way, definitely could taste hints of oregano. It had a great crispy texture! THEN THE mSAUCE!! I cant explain thr flavor but its pink, sweet and tastey!  GREEK YOGURT WITH BAKLAVA GET GET GET for 4.50! It had a slight lemony flavor, like a yakult but absolutley refreshing!! The texture is on point as well as the taste. Baklava is one of my favorite desserts. They crush it up on top! The layers were both crispy and certain bites moist, like its supposed to be.  The SERVICE quick, attentive, inviting and nice. They seem like they always want to improve. Great people!  I will be coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Quality and quantity are the words to describe this place. We enjoyed it very much. We had the porchetta and chicken pita side of fries and drinks. The sandwiches are big so you might not want to order a side. The French fries are oh so good. It's a bit on the pricey side for a regular worker lunch crowd. But I'd go there again once a month maybe."}
{"text":"Great spot for quality food at a fast pace. I am so glad I tried this place. The price is great for the amount of food you get. I had the porchetta plate (secret menu item) and it was heavenly. I highly recommend it! The meat was of good quality. Make sure to pair it with the white sauce. The customer service was absolutely amazing. Everyone was super attentive and made sure my experience was amazing."}
{"text":"Strong 4 star review. I've been to Karved twice now and I know I'll be back again in the future.  The employees here have been incredibly helpful and friendly in both of my experiences. In fact, most recently, while I was waiting I was offered samples of their soups which I thought was a really nice touch.   So both times I got their rotisserie chicken. The first time was the rotisserie meal the second time was the rotisserie wrap. My big hang up on not giving them 5 stars is the price. It's not great value for the price. Now the quality is outstanding - but so is a rotisserie chicken from Costco (best $4.99 value in the world, maybe universe). So $14 for a 1/2 chicken and two sides isn't a bargain. Add a drink and lunch is closer to $20 for one. Much better value with the wrap at $9 where you get not quite as much chicken, but the dirty work is already done for you - that price does not include a side though.  The chicken itself is outstanding. The ranch that they give you to accompany said chicken is quite possibly life changing. Seriously, do not leave Karved without it. The pita's are fresh. The side dishes I had, roasted potatoes & roasted peppers were good, but didn't really stand out. The rotisserie chicken was definitely the highlight and the reason I'd come back here. I can't say I'd frequent this place since I feel the price is high for the food you get."}
{"text":"I am super impressed with Karved. The food is really fresh, full of flavor, and the people who work there are so nice.  The pulled pork sandwich and tri tip sandwich are amazing.  The bread tastes homemade and fresh as if just coming out of the oven. I go here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch thanks to the great reviews on yelp and we were not disappointed. We had a large group with many different tastes and everyone was happy.  Staff was super friendly and greeted us all with free soup samples.  We had the pulled pork sandwich, tri-tip sandwich, tri-tip bowl, salad and sides of corn and fries. Sizes were really generous, everything was super fresh and delicious! This place is the bomb check it out!"}
{"text":"Karved is all around amazing! They have a nice menu at good prices. Manager let us try another sauce on the house (I highly recommend the garlic sauce!) We got to sample some soups as well. They put some Hershey's kisses on our tray for our meal, a small detail I really enjoyed and appreciated. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Great quick eatery.  Love the chicken pita!  Friendly staff.  Recommend to anyone looking for great rotisserie style food."}
{"text":"Amazing find and gemstone in town. I was thrilled to see tri tip on the menu! The rotisserie meats are undeniably the most succulent and tastiest, and all the sauces are unbelievable. Highly recommended checking this place out! You will go back over and over again."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the tri tip plate. The meat was flavorful and tender. The pita bread and hummus was also fantastic."}
{"text":"WOW!! Finally a a restaurant that tasted like home cooked healthy BBQ chicken and beef!!  We were so sick of eating disgusting buffet, fried foods and/or pizza. I'm sooo happy we found this place randomly. Came other husband and 2 super cranky little boys age 6 and 4 and they were so accommodating and understanding. The ambiance was super modern and clean lined. Super refreshing than the restaurants along the strip. Ordered the chicken and beef platter which came with a huge half order of chicken and lots of sliced beef with basmati rice and large pita bread and 2 sides which we got vegetarian black bean and Brussels sprout. Kids were in love with the chicken/beef/rice/pita. But I also loved the veg black beans and sprouts! Honestly that was more than enough to feed a family of 4. Husband ordered chicken rice bowl which came with large chicken breast , black beans marinated onions and Mexican style corn!! Yummie! Also he had hot sauce which was soooo good. We are super picky when it comes to food and I can't say enough about how awesome this place it. They also let us try complimentary chicken and beef soup. My little son loves the chicken soup. We were also offered complimentary dessert if frozen yogurt with crumbled baklava and I was in HEAVEN!!    I would move to Vegas just for this place!!!  Thank you for the great meal!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Fantastic service! Food was cooked perfectly and the employees were very friendly. Location is also perfect (right by the University). Definitely going to make this my new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"THE BEST PITA CHIPS AND HUMMUS I'VE EVER HAD. Dear lord I usually don't care too much about how my food tastes but this is something I will go out of my way to enjoy again. I will check in on Yelp every day if it means I get a daily supply of free pita chips and hummus.  I'm from LA, where parking usually sucks, so an open free parking lot is a blessing.  Service was outstanding. One of the workers came by our table to let me try a couple more sauces with my chicken. (Probably because he discovered I was a prestigious and highly coveted Yelp Elite.) The aji and the hot sauce were both phenomenal.  The chicken and rice were both pretty good, not amazing. But the sides were not that great. I got the brussels sprouts and the roasted peppers and they both were just meh. When I return, I'll experiment with different sides. But the pita chips made up for the actual food. The pita chips could probably even make up for my past regrets and failures.  Oh and the cucumber water is extremely refreshing on a hot Vegas day."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, there was a need for a gourmet sandwich shop in that area.   Customer service: When I walked in I was greeted right away. I asked what some of the popular sandwiches were and she named a couple as well as what she personally liked. She also offered me a small sample of the chicken cilantro soup while I waited and it was quite tasty. After a few minutes of eating an employee came up to me asking how everything was which I believe to be the owner who also gave me a sample of their cilantro jalapeño creamy sauce, soooo good. Very good customer service.   Food: I ordered the Tri Tip sandwich which was the special for the day with fries. It was perfectly made, the proportion of meat to the soft artisan bread was just perfect. The sweet carmelized onions in the sandwich really set it off and some fresh greens. The fries were nicely done, seasoned with rosemary and the fry sauce it came with...just what I love. When I say perfect I mean it. I was also given a little treat of their frozen yogurt with baklava on it and all I have to say is woooooow you could open up a shop just selling that... It had just the right amount of tartness balanced out with the sweetness and texture of the baklava.   Ambiance: The interior is very clean and tasteful with contemporary wooden tables and industrial style chairs and stools. I sat by the window. The walls have white tiles about three feet high with silver ceiling tiles. The look of a New York style pizza shop or deli but way cleaner haha. The music was also very tasteful."}
{"text":"This is easily the best independent eatery I have been to in Las Vegas.  It is close to the UNLV campus which makes it perfect for college students.   The food is superb, everything is made fresh daily and the meat is cooked rotisserie.  I tried the south-west chicken sandwich and for the price got much more than I was expecting.  The sandwich was filling, and seemed to have pulled chicken, a chipotle mayo sauce and deep fried zucchini strips. It was amazing.   The owner, Paul, was constantly attentive asking how we liked the food how we liked the food. He gave us samples of soups they had and other sauces.  I watched him interact with other patrons, he was a fun and nice guy.    I would highly recommend giving this place a try, if you do, you'll be sure to come back.  Update: they just gave us free samples of the frozen Greek Yogurt with fresh Turkish baklava on top.  One word.  AMAZING."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Great rotisserie, and didn't think that I would find this good of food in Vegas. Had the beef/chicken combo. The hot sauce was a delightfully sneaky surprise! Even had a great dessert."}
{"text":"Karved, now open for about a month, is a very welcomed addition to the strip mall that Vegas-favorite sushi spot Sakana also calls home to.   In an already tight parking lot, there will soon be less parking once the majority of Vegas learns about this delicious joint.  Quite possibly the star of the menu is their Porchetta sandwich.  One of the staff (possibly the owner?) walked me through the steps it took to create this flavorful masterpiece.  Totaling a three to four hour process, pork tenderloin is first rolled inside pork belly, then cooked rotisserie-style, and sliced up into juicy, tender pieces.  These are tossed into a fresh, chewy baguette slathered with a lemon caper gremolata spread and some greens.   If that isn't enough, pork cracklins are tossed over the sandwich to add a nice crunch to the mix.  It's just a burst full of flavor and truly makes this one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life.  My wife and I also enjoyed the combo Peruvian Chicken and Beef tri-tip combo platter with potatoes, rice, and brussel sprouts on the side.  Three sauces were all sampled and three sauces were well-liked.   Hot, aji verde, and garlic all accentuated the flavors of the meat.   The portions were generous enough to eat for lunch and have saved some left over for dinner.  The staff members were attentive, friendly, and thankful.  Likewise, I am thankful for this small establishment for bringing another fantastic food option here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp it popped up as hot and new so decided to give it a try .....   It's in the target parking lot in Maryland and flamingo beside tiabi which I have been there as well   Kind of a small place not many choices places to sit but it was empty and I was taking it to go as well   The workers were super friendly and nice  I got the Karved chicken pita with a side of Brussels sprouts ....   Mmmm yummy the chicken pita was so good has a nice flavor and the chicken was juicy not dry every bite was amaZing and full of flavor... the Brussels sprouts were just as yummy not hard not to soft just perfect with effect  seasoning   My good came fast and I paid about 12$ for my Meal   I will come back to check out the rest of the menu  Check this place out I'm sure it won't disappoint"}
{"text":"I'm an expert on Karved. A few weeks ago I ate here every day for a week. I've tried just about everything on the menu. The quality is almost unprecedented. The care and service are unequaled. The recipes are superb. The vegetarian sandwich is a small cornucopia of beautiful grape tomatoes, tender greens, pickled onions, garlic sauce and hummus. The street corn is as good as any I've ever had. The Brussels sprouts with the drippings from the rotisserie are a healthy treat. The porchetta sandwich, however, deserves a Nobel Prize for sandwiches. I eat all over Las Vegas and all over the world and this is my favorite sandwich of the year. Maybe any year. Get in that Uber. Take that cab. This is where you want to get terrific food for a decent price in a clean and casual setting. Bravo!"}
{"text":"The welcoming we got when we walked in set the tone for the whole experience. They really made us feel welcome. I thought that food was good but I wasn't thrilled with my sandwich but it's because it was something that I don't normally eat but my friends recommended it. The sides were fantastic though and the desert was amazing too!  Bottom line this is a new place that people need to go to and try out. If I lived closer I'd definitely be back more often. Come on folks this is a personally owned restaurant that will give you personal service and a personal meal. Support local!!!  Best of luck Karved!"}
{"text":"Great food. Well seasoned. I had the chicken and beef plate with a side of Brussel sprouts and black beans. Wow. I would come back for sure. Need to try the beef dip!    I was so satisfied with the service and the food. Give it try. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Damn, this place serves some pretty bomb beef tri tip and especially porchetta!  I ordered the beef tri tip plate, which came with 2 sides, rice, and pita bread. I opted for the mashed potatoes and cole slaw. There are three sauces: garlic, aji verde (Peruvian vibe) and HOT sauce (Mexican vibe). All three tastes really good with the tri tip.   I also got to try the porchetta, which was basically kind of like chopped up lechon. They have their meat on rotisserie though, so it slowly cooks all day. Most sauces and ingredients are all made in house, which is great because that is the best way to control your quality.   Super friendly service, very clean interior, and free WiFi.... not to mention some high quality bomb meat. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Fresh fresh meats and soups. Try the cilantro chicken soup! You will not be disappointed. We had the porchetta sandwich with fries and 1/4 chicken white combo. You can tell they care about the quality of the food. I was looking for a little bit more flavor but it's good nonetheless. Frozen Greek yogurt with baklava is tasty."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and usually inhale my food prior to taking a picture. Today I was able to stop mid-sammich, wipe my pork-belly fat greased hands, and finally snag a pic. I am not going to say much more than anything that has already been said, but here goes. This place is 5 stars all the way.   The porchetta sandwich is heavenly. Pork-belly, crispy skin, arugula and 2 amazing sauces all stuffed into a not-to-be outdone pillowy baguette, make up this monster. The lemon spread that they use on the sandwich is amazing.   The fries, dare I say, are the best fries that I have EVER had, anywhere - I know this is a bold statement, but this is by no means an exaggeration. They are so crispy and have some type of salt and vinegar hint to them - couple that with the fry sauce and it's a home run.   The staff is simply top notch. I have never had less than a stellar experience and will have no problem returning! They also give a different little treat with each meal. Today's was an Andy's mint .   Seriously, don't go here. You won't want to leave."}
{"text":"A wonderful find a few blocks off the strip in a strip mall.  Very clean interior and a simple menu of fresh carved meat offerings.  Always nice to find small family owned restaurants with quality food.  The Tri-tip sandwich is amazing and the sides are generous.  We were a party of adults and kids and all were happy and left satisfied."}
{"text":"Solid food, excellent customer service. Every, single time. Do yourself a favor, get the tri-tip sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing place! The staff is very kind and they make sure your visit is a pleasant one. Im out of town and would definitely come back when in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Porchetta sandwich was amazing!! Joe, the owner, was very personable and friendly but really the food here was the star, can't wait to come back!! Open one in San Antonio please"}
{"text":"was in the area and decided to try the porchetta plate. Priscilla and Angel very hospitable. Great customer service skills. Great employees! The porchetta plate was probably one of the best pirk dishes I have ever tasted. I recommend the roasted peppers and black beans with the pork dish. Will definetly come back on my next trip to vegas!"}
{"text":"In my pursuit of finding something keto-friendly on my lunch break; I looked to Karved.  I made a few alterations to my beef and chicken combo - however it did prove to be delicious and keto approved! I ordered the beef and chicken combo with no rice, no pita, and brussel sprouts for my sides (x2).   As soon as I put a piece of beef tri-tip in my mouth...I knew this was the best lunch decision I could have made for myself today. It was deliciously tender and seasoned to perfection. The chicken was tasty as well. I opted-in for the dark meat option. While not as juicy as the tri-tip, the chicken was still very satisfying. Both meats paired extremely well with the house-made garlic sauce (garlic, lemon, and oil). The brussel sprouts were not my favorite. I have definitely had better. However, the overall food experience I had at Karved was excellent.   On a side note: I always like to give credit where credit is due. I believe that customer service is the key to a great business. Angel did a great job of this. From my take-out phone call to leaving the restaurant - she provided a great customer service experience. Thank you, Angel!"}
{"text":"Finding good food off the strip can be tough if you aren't a local and have time commitments- enter Karved near the corner of Flamingo and Maryland--   Enter Karved, which specialized in a few things, primarily  This place is known for sandwiches, and I ordered:  Tri Tip sandwich - one of the best tri tip sandwiches I have tasted from a non bbq spot! Very tender and with the caramelized onions it was delicious! Good portion size, fresh fixings, and it was devoured quickly! 4 stars  Porschetta sandwich- Another solid sandwich to try out.  The pork is cubed, and they added in spinach that complimented the pork perfectly. The pork has crispy skin, and it's juicy! Definitely worth a try when you visit. Check out my pic.   Do yourself a favor and skip the fast food eateries at the corner, look behind those spots and get your 'Karved' on!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, really tasty pork belly wrapped Porchetta sandwich with lemon sauce, arugula, and Gremolata all on a soft as a pillow baguette.  You can tell they take pride in what they do and it shows. No question I'd stop in here again to explore more of their offerings."}
{"text":"My friend and I go to Sakanna and saw Karved next door. Finally gave it a try and WOW!  Tried the half beef and half chicken (a leg and a thigh) with our choice of 2 sides, rice, bread, and 2 sauces for only $13.50! You get way more bang for your buck!  So pleasantly surprised. And the staff was extremely helpful. Customer service top notch, they gave us samples of their sauces (I'd recommend the aji or garlic).  Definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been on a fitness journey and have made some awesome transformations over the past two months. I often struggle on where I can eat if not at home. Tonight I happen to be near Karved and was absolutely starving. I checked Yelp and saw the great reviews so decided to give it a try.  I got the rotisserie chicken with roasted potatoes and peppers. The chicken was really juicy and the sides were made perfectly as well. Everything was so fresh and healthy!  I just wish there was one closer to home for me.   Also, this restaurant is owner run and managed. The customer service and attention to detail was impeccable. The owners' and staff engagement and friendliness is definitely a major plus!! It's so refreshing to see.   I also had the frozen Greek yogurt with baklava and OMG!!! Delicious! Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you just flew in and got your rental car, this is exactly where you should go. The corn is good. The porchetta is great. The chicken is great. The staff is great. Paul is very cool and I hope his business succeeds.   Let's see how else  I can help them with additional search terms.  \"food near LAS\"  \"Sandwich masters\" \"Hell yeah\""}
{"text":"Thank you to all the people who gave their reviews on Karved. My family and I were headed to Colorado and we stopped by Vegas to have lunch. We did not want to take long for lunch and we also did not want to eat the a chain restaurants. So we decided to stopped at Karved. We recommend this place to everyone. It's off the strip so you will not get stuck in traffic. The food is so delicious and staff are awesome and very friendly. My family order pulled porks and Porchetta. The pork was very tasty lots of flavor. It just melts in your mouth. Karved did not disappoint. My family was very happy!!! Yelp has it as American Food but we think it a fusion of different cultures. Checkout Karved when your in Vegas!"}
{"text":"When you want something healthy and a little bit different this is the place to go. Food is always done the way you order it. Staff is friendly and helpful if you have any questions. Oh and the taste is very good. Presentation is pretty and very appetizing."}
{"text":"Great food and the staff was very friendly. We ate here a couple of weeks ago and enjoyed it thoroughly. Very fresh food and well prepared."}
{"text":"Tasty food! Large portions of food justify the pricing. I definitely left smelling like garlic haha- Greek vibe with all the hummus! The bread for the tri tip and pita were soft and delicious- they also gave us samples of the soup (heavy sodium, but the chicken was delicious!) and the Greek frozen yogurt (tart but I LOVED it!). No soda on tap, only bottles- but I loved the infused water they had for everyone. The staff was easily 10/10 on customer service with their friendly nature! Bathroom was kind of in an odd location but the place was very clean. I got the veggie pita with no red onion- only complaint was the hummus made the pita soggy and drippy toward the last few bites. Fries were delicious! Though, I may still smell like garlic tomorrow."}
{"text":"Although tucked in the back of a strip mall. The food was awesome, Maybe a tad expensive, but still definitely place to go."}
{"text":"From the vibrant atmosphere, to the highly engaged and friendly staff, to the innovative menu, this restaurant is outstanding in every way. The creative menu includes rotisserie chicken, tri-tip and porchetta, and an ecliptic variety of delicious sauces. The basmati rice was perfectly prepared and the side dishes were fresh and tasty. Their signature desert was tart yogurt, with homemade crumbled baklava. Overall, the meats and sides were prepared, flavored and served perfectly. The staff excelled in the art of hospitality and customer service. Highly recommended and bring a hearty appetite."}
{"text":"Ok, then! We had a group lunch for our local Navy Moms of Nevada group and stopped in at Karved for lunch at 1pm today. The place is very clean and the menu is a mixture of sides, sandwiches, salads, and wraps. There were six of us and some had the veggie pita which includes a very nicely flavored hummus, perfectly roasted peppers, cherry tomatoes, and the purple middle eastern slaw-like cabbage. Pita bread was good. We also got the side order of brussels sprouts, which is mildly seasoned with pepper and butter, and just right. One had the chicken salad, one the tri-tip salad, one the soup of the day.  The staff was very welcoming and most helpful with the ordering process. We bought our meals at the counter and the staff delivered them to the table, pretty rapidly. Staff checked on everyone and kept our water refilled too. At the end of the meal, we were given a free sample of the dessert, which is frozen yogurt with bahklava sprinkles on top. It was a very positive experience and I would definitely return to try some more of the menu.  Parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"Happened upon this little gem tonight and was pleasantly surprised! The staff and owners were very accommodating and friendly!! They helped me out together a yummy snack of tri tip with well done fries and roasted peppers. Simple but delicious and satiating enough to get you through rush hour!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Had a Southwest Chicken sandwich that was delightful."}
{"text":"I was a lil hesitant at the beginning but so glad I went to this place. Great food, excellent service. Happy!"}
{"text":"Karved!! If you're in Vegas, it's a place you must go to. Their Porchetta!! OMG!! It is absolutely delicious! The juicy pieces of pork mixed with the crispy pieces of pork...even just thinking about it makes my mouth water. My family had their beef and chicken combo. Everything was so yum yum!! Their sauces! All made in house. So much flavor. So much goodness. My kids loved their chicken soup! Basically, I really only have good things to say abt this place. From the food, to dessert (try the Greek yogurt. It is heavenly.), to the staff and service, everything was excellent! I can't wait to go back to Vegas so that I can eat their juicy mouthwatering Porchetta...mmmmm......"}
{"text":"I go into Karved about once every two weeks! Let me tell you, some of the best pita and hummus I have ever had!!! The fries, to die for, the elote, to die for, the donut bites, to die for, all of it is so good. I am a fairly picky eater but love everything I have ever had here! Wish I could give them more stars and go in every day!  Not to mention everyone who works there is super helpful AND nice. The staff keeps the place super clean and loves giving their full attention to the guests."}
{"text":"In town for YAGP that my daughter was dancing in. Came to this place yesterday and it was 5 stars - food, service. Decided to come back today bc husband and I wanted to try the salad and order the chicken cilantro soup again. And bc we liked it so much yesterday. Today was awful. Paid $3 extra for the tri tip which was overcooked. My husband paid $2 extra for chicken and he almost choked on a bone. The soup was bland. We added the lemon that we asked for for our water. They never refilled our water like yesterday. My husband had to get up and ask for it. The girl started to take my food away when I wasn't finished yet. Whatever happened to asking first before reaching over me and putting your hands on my plate? Service was awful. Everyone around us was getting free samples of food or being offered free dessert samples. Not us. And the girl never came back to take my empty plate so we bussed our own table as was the custom I guess. I can't believe I asked the girl yesterday to tell the owner to consider opening one in LA or OC. They can forget it. What an awful experience today. I wish we didn't tip them right off the bat like yesterday and instead waited to tip them after we were done eating! The girl yesterday deserved it. These ones today - not so much! Terrible!"}
{"text":"My company has a booth at the convention center this week and I was put in charge of food for our staff. We've had the typical Chipotle, Panera, Halal Guys, etc. so I wanted to change it up. I turned to trusty Yelp and found Karved, which is close by, does takeout, AND has 5 star reviews!  Karved actually opens at 11am, but I called at 10:52am and they immediately answered my call. I placed a large group order and they had everything ready to go in less than an hour. The food was still warm when we got back to the convention center.  The service here is really great. They got all of our orders right and everyone had utensils. They also threw in some extra sauces for us to try. Because I had a large group order, the guy also helped me carry it out to my car! So nice of them.  The only con is that because they use eco friendly takeout boxes, the boxes get kind of mushy. They actually get bonus points from me for using an eco friendly takeout option, but if you need your box to last through a long day, I suggest asking for an extra box and layering it.   Most people got the tri-tip platter and some got the salad. Everyone in my group really enjoyed their food. I got the porchetta platter and it was SO GOOD. I added the garlic sauce to it and it was on point. My coworker tried mine and actually said he wish he ordered mine instead. The porchetta also has the most perfectly crispy pieces of pork skin too. The servings of food are huge and will probably take me at least two meals to finish.  Oh, I also saw on the board that they had frozen Greek yogurt with baklava. Amazing. I wish I wasn't doing take out because I DEFINITELY would've gotten this. It's what my dreams are made of.  Whether you need something easy and fast or you want to have a sit down meal, I'd recommend Karved for both!"}
{"text":"Never Again! Rice dry Chicken dry Mashed , too much butter Brussel sprouts mushy Green peppers, gross Karved RIP"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken salad and it was really good! The chicken breast was moist and there were a lot of flavors happening in the salad"}
{"text":"Reading some of the reviews people wrote makes me laugh. This place earns every bit of 5 stars and maybe more for the quality of food that is produced out of such a small location. Sometimes it's not about how much you pay for the product but it is all about the preparation. If people want to be petty we can break down the process and you will see the value in the product. First is the price of the product, ingredients to prepare product, time it takes to prepare product, cost of the employee preparing the product, the cost of the space you are sitting in to eat the product and to top it all off what is the price of not doing dishes. Paul, joe and their family put their heart and passion into this place.   Food was amazing. Must try their porchetta sandwich as I had that and plus the beef/chicken combo."}
{"text":"This place is all around great. Super fresh food. Everything is made in house. I got the southwestern chicken sandwich and the pita and chips. Both amazing. I've never had pita cooked so perfectly. The design of the restaurant super modern and sleek. Lastly, the staff and owners were super friendly. They brought the food to us and asked us how it was. We really enjoyed our lunch there. Great spot. Will definitely go there again when back in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Visited on Dec. 22st after an appointment in the area. My father had the porchetta sandwich and I had the tri- tip beef. Both meals were wonderful. My father said it was probably the best sandwich he had ever eaten. My meal was great. The brussel sprouts were prepared perfectly and the potatoes were seasoned \"just right\". If I had to have one complaint, it would be that the rice was a little dry. That wouldn't keep me from ordering that meal again or recommending Karved as a destination to satisfy one's tastebuds. Thanks much Karved for a great meal."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there we are not from Vegas and found this place by chance . Service was fantastic everyone was so nice, gave us samples of soup which is home made samples were huge. Food was very good overall , we ordered the chicken beef plate, southwest chicken sandwich and two pancetta sandwich. Big portions we didn't leave hungry! Loved the baklava dessert. Such a good place to try."}
{"text":"Love this place! Got the tri tip with caramelized  onions and seasoned fries and sauce so good my boyfriend loved the porchetta homemade pork belly *drool* ! Plus the people running it are pretty laid back and  super nice. They offered us complementary soup that was made with chicken, cilantro , rice and corn and it was fire! If you're by unlv and want a sandwich made with love this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Best Cilantro Chicken soup! I defiantly recommend this place! Awesome atmosphere and very clean!"}
{"text":"I was amazed of how delicious the food was at karved!! And the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Best porchetta sandwich I have ever eaten!! GREAT flavor and so moist and tender. Everything we ordered was great. I highly recommend! Staff was very friendly. Price point was spot on. Definitely worth every penny.. My new favorite place. Thank you!"}
{"text":"love love love this place. the sandwiches are rich meaty and have that perfect bite.  The time i did order form karved I got three sandwiches, the trip tip, the porchetta, and the southwest chicken sandwich.  All of them were amazing. the southwest was moist and their sauce was fantastic.  I loved the porchetta sandwich which had a nice crunch and was so flavorful and fatty. lastly i had to try the tri tip one. Which was also great, but my least favorite one. the meat was tender, and very satisfying. the worst part of this place is the location. that parking lot is awful.  I love this place and I need to go back. the greek yogurt is also a great way to end your meal. The owner was super cool and the employees were amazing and chill."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! Try the beef and chicken combo and the southwest chicken sandwich. Their soups are very good too and so is their Greek yogurt w/baklava dessert."}
{"text":"This spot is great if you want quality food relatively fast. The prices are great, and the customer service was some of the best I've ever experienced. The entire staff was very welcoming.   We had the tri-tip sandwich and chicken pita both were really good. I would check them out if you're in town. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We had the porchetta w/dirty mashed taters and black beans accompanied by aji verde sauce & garlic sauce. I absolutely love the atmosphere, the vibe/ambiance. The owner is personable, interactive & attentive unlike most owners who usually sit tucked away in their offices. I shall return for repeat visits as this has now become one of my favorite local eateries."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you're greeted with a bright smile behind the counter. The menu is on brown paper to the left on the wall (kinda neat). I let the cashier know it was our first time and she right away recommended the panchetta sandwich so we ordered one of those and I figured we should also try the chicken since you can't find a good rottisery chicken place around here. You have your choices of sides for the chicken plate. I decided on the brussel sprouts and roasted peppers. What place has brussel sprouts? Yum!  We were also given some samples of the chicken soup. Not only was it delicious!... But my 6 month old baby was able to have some (it wasn't overpowering with spices). Her first taste of chicken soup!  Over all the panchetta was good.. Loved the bread, so soft. Next time I'll probably smother a sauce on it. The chicken was good... But what made it amazing was the GARLIC SAUCE. If you like garlic and lemon and maybe even avocado...you will LOVE this sauce.  Oh! And we sampled the dessert.  Bakalava shavings over greek frozen yogurt. It was different but delicious and tart...but sweet!  Service was great. I appriciate them noticing us and our little one and making our experience memorable!"}
{"text":"I ordered a dark meat meal with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. The chicken was so flavorful and tender. The sides were also. I'm coming back soon. Plus the staff is super chill."}
{"text":"Hey Tourists, there is more to just the strip in Vegas! The strip is overrated so we decided to look the other direction! Like this gem we came across...Wow, talk about great service and great food! We ordered the Beef tri-tip sandwich and the chicken pita. Both were superb and we certainly left content! Oh and don't forget dessert!! Frozen Greek yogurt and baklava sealed the deal! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend and I was  surprised how delicious everything was. Was able to talk with the owners and learned a little about how everything came about. Atmosphere was awesome. Food was fresh and all made in house, which is hard to find nowadays. Highly recommend the pork/pork belly sandwich... has a nice crisp to it and was absolutely amazing. Serving sizes are great, I was able to save a little for later bc I couldn't finish it.  Make sure to try the soup if they offer it during the wait. So good.  Try a few of the sauces too... bomb.com but be careful with the hot sauce... it has a good kick.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I can't tell enough people how amazing the Hummus and Pita is. Great customer service and always samples to taste. Simple clean decor.  Assortment of food from around the world but definitely the best of it all!"}
{"text":"One word- PHENOMENAL  and I'm not just talking about the food. The staff, the atmosphere, the business model- everything is done the way a restaurant should be done.  The food is great, but it's the staff that's really gonna have you coming back for more. Come here if you want some of the best barbecue in Las Vegas, or the friendliest people in town."}
{"text":"Wow. I have never been to a small joint that has had this level of customer service and quality of food before!   We needed to try something new and I'm so glad we pondered on to Karved. We were immediately greeted by the whole staff with genuine smiles. We were taking a look at the menu, not sure of what to order when the cashier (didn't get her name but she was the best!) offered us her help.  We ordered a porchetta and tri-tip with a side of pita chips and hummus. My husband bought a soda and I basically took posession of the complimentary cucumber water which was so refreshing!  Let me tell you guys - theeeeee bread on these sandwiches (or whatever they're called) was SO soft and warm, I really wanted to order a side of it alone with the garlic sauce  I tried both sandwiches and they both had a nice punch of distinct flavor. But my favorite was the pita and hummus.  Before this gets too long i just want to say that I really appreciate the service we were provided. The cashier was so sweet and offered us two samples of the soups they had while we were waiting for our food - which didn't take long at all to begin with. We had small checkups with the staff asking how the food was which was a nice touch. Finally when we were about leave, one of the gentleman asked us if we wanted to sample the Greek yogurt with baklava! Everyone was just having a good day today or what!?  I wasn't looking for anything free but just seeing how much they cared about us trying their menu was really inviting. I normally don't tip as high in a casual joint due to the lack of service but with Karved it was well deserved.   I really appreciated what the staff did for us today. We loved the food, loved the atmosphere, overall will be coming back! And we'll bring our friends and family back next time. Thanks for the great lunch!"}
{"text":"Tri tip sandwich is top shelf.  Very Tasty food across the board.  Terrific service as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch the other day. Super cute and modern space located in a plaza up the street from UNLV. We were greeted the second we walked in.   Angel explained the menu to us and after a few minutes of looking over it we ordered the half chicken plate with Brussels sprouts and roasted potatoes and the Aji verde sauce that Angel said compliments the chicken well, a French dip sandwich, and Karved fries with fry sauce.   We sat at a table. Angel brought us samples of the cilantro chicken soup and the spicy beef soup. Both of them were tasty and served piping hot. After a few minutes our main dishes came out.   The rotisserie chicken was super tasty and juicy and the sauce for dipping was so good. The chicken was served over basmati rice and the potatoes and Brussels sprouts went well with the chicken. The French dip was served on pillowy soft bread and was piled high with juicy tri tip. It was served with horseradish and Au jus on the side. The fries were seasoned well and crispy and the fry sauce was tasty. One of the owners Paul also brought us a side of the garlic sauce which was tasty and complimented everything really well.   Throughout our meal Paul, Joe, and Angel checked on us to make sure everything was good. They also brought us samples of frozen Greek yogurt which was tangy and refreshing and it was topped with crumbled baklava. It was the perfect bite sized ending to an amazing lunch.   I can't wait to come back and try more items off of the menu. Karved is fresh, hot, quality food with top notch service to boot. My mouth is currently watering just thinking about the meal I had. Welcome to Las Vegas and please open a Henderson location soon.   #KarvedLV I'm a fan"}
{"text":"Amazing. The rotisserie meat here is as good as advertised. Quite possibly my new favorite sandwich place in Las Vegas. They have something for everyone, including rotisserie plates for the carb-conscious as well as an \"un-karved\" vegetarian pita wrap.   As I was in the mood for a sandwich, I settled on the beef tri-tip. For $11, the baguette was stuffed with a generous helping of \"karved\" beef. I loved the garlic sauce and onion marmalade. I was also surprised by how soft the baguette was as many places have hard bread that ends up cutting the roof of my mouth. The beef was tender, juicy, and very flavorful. I also ended up getting a side of fries with fry sauce, which came pipping hot. Each meal is accompanied with a small candy bar to end on a sweet note.   I will definitely be back to try their many other offerings including the porchetta sandwich, eloté corn, and dessert. I'm curious to see how their frozen greek yogurt with baklava crumble stacks up to the baklava ice cream from Meraki."}
{"text":"The best chicken soup I have ever had!!! Family run business and  it's awesome. Everything homemade. The chicken was so moist and the garlic sauce was amazing. They also make their croutons homemade. You have to try this place, you'll be glad you did. The only thing wrong is i live in California and i wont get to eat this as often as i would like. I will however come here when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Karved Rotisserie Meats - Las Vegas (Maryland Parkway & Flamingo)  There is no denying it, Karved deserves their 5-Star Yelp Review average.  I could have easily given Karved 5-Stars after just one visit, but decided to hold off until I visited them for a 2nd time.  Karved's menu includes chicken, beef, and Porchetta plates & combos straight from their rotisserie, sandwiches, an awesome hot dog, 5 different sides, and small bites including Elote corn on a cob. Karved is perfect if you're craving good tasting food that can be healthy at the same time.  Their meats are locally sourced and carved to order.  I loved everything that I have tasted.    Listed are my thoughts of each...  *The Beef & Chicken Combo: This meal comes with 2 sides, a bed of rice, pita, and Karved sauce.  The portions are generous, and the Peruvian chicken is so tasty.  This meal is lean and perfect if you're looking to keep it \"clean\". This will be one of my go-to meals when I start cutting the calories.   *1/4 Pound All Beef Hot Dog: Give me two of these, please. I'm not typically a hot dog type of dude, but will make the exception at Karved.  The hot dog is served in a French roll.  The Karved garlic sauce and hummus give this dog an interesting taste to it.  Karved's Hot Dog is one of the best 1/4 beef hot dogs that I have ever had.  This is one of my favorites.  *Porchetta:  You can get this in a pita or sandwich.  If there's only one item to get here, this is it.  The pork tenderloin is cooked under the rotisserie for 3+ hours, which explains why it's so juicy and packed with flavor.  The crispy pork belly gives it that crunchy texture. Ask for a sample before you decide on it.  Or, just trust me.  The Porchetta alone is worth the visit.   *Greek Yogurt w/Baklava Crumbs:  Tangy and crunchy at the same time.  The Baklava crumbs is addicting.  It's just too bad that they don't sell Baklava on its own.   As for service, it really doesn't get any better than Karved.  When I arrived for the 2nd time, the entire staff welcomed me by name.  They either have great memories or they recognize me for my beautiful fork picture. It's all about service at Karved and they go out of their way to ensure that every guest is treated well.  I was on my way to the airport on one of my visits and got my order to-go. When I got to my destination, I noticed a Christmas greeting card inside my bag.  It was addressed to me with a special note from the team at Karved wishing me a great holiday and thanking me for my repeated visit.  Awesome Sauce!!  I look forward to coming back really soon."}
{"text":"Karved is very clean and modern. Great music playing over the speaker. This is a good stop for a lunch on the go or sit and stay. It was our first time. Server recognized that and helped familiarize me with the menu. She even offered a free sample of the soups. Delicious. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich as it was the special for the day and came with fries. Both were excellent, fresh, and just the right amount. This is definitely going to be a go to for a good sandwich."}
{"text":"This was amaze balls!!! From the service to the food . Very clean !!!! Soooo gooooodd"}
{"text":"This absolutely the BEST steaks ever. Ask for the garlic coating on top. It is not over-board with garlic, but what a tasty treat. I will return as they are one of the \"Best in the West\"' to me."}
{"text":"The Goodwich might finally have a challenger for the local sandwich crown.  Karved is a new fast-casual restaurant focused on rotisserie meats and, thus far, a simple menu with sandwiches, plates, sides, and some other items. They're sandwiched (appropriately) between TIABI and Sakana in a fairly small strip mall on Maryland Parkway.   My eyes lit up when I first saw porchetta on the menu photo. It's not a common if at all available pork preparation in this town (or at least as far as Yelp reviews have cataloged it). After I checked with a friend and received confirmation that it's awesome, I beelined there for lunch, finding the place fortunately (for me) not very busy.  After seeing the rotisserie at work right behind the counter, with Brussels sprouts and roasted potatoes both filling drip trays below the porchetta, I decided that I should go pick one of those as a side. Fearing a potential food coma, I kept it light by picking the Brussels sprouts ($4), which appropriately came out at the same time as the sandwich. I wouldn't outright call them mushy, but they're on the soft side and had no crunch. Also, the portion on this was a bit modest for the price. At least the Brussels sprouts are subtly tasty, likely owing to the porchetta drippings.  The owner was offering sample cups of Cilantro Chicken Soup ($5) while people waited for their orders. After tasting it, I almost had to order one to-go. It's balanced in seasoning and thickness, and the chicken was so tender that you don't even have to hear the owner say that the soup is made fresh daily. Plus, the bowl is quite generously sized.  I did bury the lede a bit, and that's the brilliant Porchetta Sandwich ($12). I was worried that the \"French baguette\" bread would be tough if not outright sharp, but it was simply a delicious and chewy container for the goodness within. That treasure starts with awesome porchetta, including juicy pork loin and the crispy skin of the belly, the latter an unparalleled textural experience. The lemon sauce (with herbs) complements everything perfectly, and the fresh arugula completes the Italian-inspired experience. It doesn't get too messy compared to some sandwiches.  The porchetta alone earns Karved a top rating in my book, and the chicken soup was memorable enough for me to overlook the Brussels sprouts. Hopefully, I'll be free to come back soon to try some of their other options, including that yet-to-be-explored tri-tip."}
{"text":"Man so let me just say this place is soooo bomb. I went to the nail shop next door and after all my pampering decided to grab a bite to eat. I walked a couple doors down and stumbled across this delicious place KARVED!!! I got a menu first and stepped outside to decide if this was the move!!!! After reviewing the menu and seeing all the delicious sounding choices. I went back in and decided to go with the Karved Roasted Chicken Pita, can't go wrong with that!! When I received my food which by the way came out fast and fresh I was surprised by the great portion and presentation  so let's get to the great part. This pita was soooo packed with flavor I was so amazed. Chicken was so delicious and the goddess dressing and hummus were a plus!!! I'm from Long Beach CA so I'm a little bummed that they're currently only located in Vegas!!! Everyone was friendly there and I'll definitely be coming back!!! Oh yeah order the chicken cilantro soup as well it's freaking fire!!! As in bomb for my non slang speakers hahaha. Ok I can go on and on about how good it was but I'll let you try it for yourself!!!!"}
{"text":"Got lucky and found this gem on yelp. I had the chicken pita. It was SO good! Tender meat, the pita is so soft, and their customer service is awesome. The pita and meat melted on my mouth. Do yourself a favor and come here. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Super nice employees and owner! The food was delish!! Super clean and friendly. Let us even try the delicious soup (which i highly recommend) and the dessert was yummy! Check them out!"}
{"text":"This is a nice stop for lunch. Clean bright white tiles and metal decor. It smells amazing in here. The herb scents start you mouth watering. I had a veggie sandwich with roasted peppers, purple onions, arugula, on a pita. Very palatable and full of flavor. My friend had a pork sandwich. It was moist and filling. The bread tastes fresh. The staff is polite, friendly and welcoming. Prices are reasonable. I would definitely recommend supporting this mom and pop sandwich shop so I can keep swinging by whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"Karved is a new and trendy rotisserie place. The menu is small and direct. The service is warm and friendly. The food is good, the chicken falls off the bone and the tri-tip is juicy and tender. They have brussel sprouts! Over all decent, the sides need a little more flavor but I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I read in a magazine that Karved's garlic sauce rivaled Zankou's. I'm from LA and felt that was too bold a statement to go untested. Granted, I was a tad hungover from the night before and my appetite was a bit wonky but knew my tummy would thank me for some needed sustenance.   We shared the combo plate and the server gave us all three sauces to try. The chicken was moist and flavorful. And to my surprise, the garlic sauce was PHENOMENAL. Just a small amount packs a punch and, depending on your preference, might even edge out the old LA standby (sorry, Zankou!) because it doesn't linger on your tongue or make you feel like a garlic bomb went off in your mouth or have you fiending after a breath mint after the meal (note: Karved gives you a chocolate mint as part of your meal). The hot sauce also has a kick that I enjoyed. The pitas are high quality and I recommend getting an order of hummus. The pitas come perfectly warm and crispy-soft (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside) without being greasy.   Food aside, I loved the look and feel of the place. From Karved's mission statement, the hand-written menu on butcher paper, the polished metal ceiling, and even the oh-so-cute bathroom, you can tell that each decorative decision was chosen with care.   I'm hoping to try everything on the menu one day. The service was also top notch and friendly. It's worth the trip off the strip! Trust."}
{"text":"Ooommmggosh!!!  I am a legit salad lover....and this place did not disappoint!!! I got the Karved salad with tri tip and vinaigrette dressing. The meat was not overly seasoned (like a lot of places) and it was tender. Everything in the salad had a purpose. All of the vegetable flavors blended nicely and the salad was made up with all mixed greens....no iceberg lettuce!  On top of that the customer service was genuinely pleasant. I was greeted soon as I came in the door and thanked when I left. I ordered my salad to go and was provided a neat brown paper bag with handles and did not have to ask for silverware.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Such personable service and such wholesome ingredients in their dishes. Clean indoor sitting area.  The cilantro soup was light and fragrant with lots of ingredients. The spicy beef soup was rich with bits of beef and veggies in it. Soothing during a chilly night.  The beef and chicken plate is served with rice, pita and 2 sides. Got a mammoth order of brussell sprouts and paid a little more for a whole ear of corn sprinkled with ooey gooey goodness. The tri tip meat was soft and went really well with their spicy hot jalapeno sauce. The chicken was juicy and soft. No knife needed. The creamy cilantro sauce went well with the chicken. So glad that the meats and soups were not salty.  Easy parking. Friendly workers."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They are very creative  the way they prepare the food. Very different than the chain restaurant. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My family drove out to Las Vegas from Los Angeles and we had a picky eater with us ;) We found this place based on yelp reviews and let me tell you, this place is amazing! The owners are SO FRIENDLY, HELPFUL, and you can tell they love what they do. One of the owners said his wife uses her own homemade recipes and you can really tell she does. He gave us a free sample of both the soups (WHICH WERE AMAZING) and free samples of the froyo with baklava (oh my god it is to die for) I ended up getting chicken pita (it was the perfect size) and everyone else got half chickens with their 2 sides which they loved! I wish this place was closer so we could go again, but I really recommend this place!! The picky eater was satisfied and so was I :)"}
{"text":"Ode to the Porchetta, where have you been all my life? How I miss you from my days in San Francisco. When I first met you, you were spinning gleefully near an open flame in a food truck. Our life  were simpler then together. I would go to school and visit you on the weekend near the Ferry Building. You liked to tuck yourself between two soft slices of bread drowned with arugula. Your skin was supple and crispy. Your meat juicy and succulent. Now, you're all grown up, living next to the strip, dating roasted birds and dabbling with rice and sauces. I'm not sure how I feel about the change, but I confess I still love you anyways. Hope we meet up again."}
{"text":"Loved it. Brand new and great quality food.  Fantastic environment. I miss all the great rotisserie restaurants in Los Angeles and I am glad I found this as any new go to spot."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday and it wasn't busy at all. The cashier was very friendly and helped guide us through the menu. Boyfriend and I ordered a beef tri-tip sandwich and the porchetta sandwich to share. We also ordered fries with fry sauce. The staff was all very friendly and accommodating. The sandwiches were pretty big and I really enjoyed the porchetta sandwich, the pork was tender and the skin was very crispy and crunchy. Whatever sauce they served with it complimented it very well. The tri-tip was also good in that the marmalade and caramelized onions made the sandwich pretty sweet and tasty. Boyfriend didn't like it so much and said it was too sweet for his liking. However, the meat itself was not tender and was slightly tough and chewy. The fries were crispy (alittle too crispy for me) and slightly too salty so we couldn't eat it all. The fry sauce is basically ketchup-mayo and was pretty good. Overall, this was a nice new restaurant to try but I wouldn't make the effort to come back."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this new gem - completely worth it. Clean. Staff is extremely friendly. The spicy southwest beef soup is perfect! The Tri-tip sandwich is delicious! So is the Porchetta! Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing frozen Greek yogurt with baklava, topped with phenomenally kind service! I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Karved is a welcomed addition to the food corner at this Target strip mall by UNLV.  Stopped by the other night and got to try the meat platter with brussel sprouts/roasted potatoes and the hotdog. Meats (couple different to choose from) are from a rotisserie tasted really good, lot of flavor and cooked just right.  Karved does it's own take on the hotdog which was good as well. Chicken soup was also amazing, can't wait to get more of that for the winter. Costumer service was top notch, made us feel very welcomed."}
{"text":"The chicken pita wraps are the best thing ever  love this place!!!! Fresh ingredients and friendly wait staff!"}
{"text":"Karved is a perfect and impressive newish option in the Las Vegas casual dining scene. The Porchetta sandwich ranks as one of the top sandwiches I've ever had in my life: Perfectly cooked pork, crispy skin, pork belly, and a delicious lemony arugula salad on a perfect mini baguette. It's fantastic and I recommend it to anyone who loves pork and bread. The french fries were crispy and perfectly done. Not too salty or herby either.  Now let's talk about the masterful sauces.  -The fry sauce is tasty. I'm usually a catsup fan but with this sauce, I didn't miss the catsup.  -Hot- It is f*cking hot, but delicious. Not quite a salsa but I'd love it on a taco made with Karved's Tri-tip. The flavor is bomb.  -Garlic- Creamy, garlicky, soothing. Its like horseradish cream with garlic instead. Perfect for beef or chicken.   The service is kind, quick, and attentive. Everyone wants to make you feel at home and they want you to return. They are all genuine and seem to love being at Karved. This is such a rare ambience in the restaurant industry that I recommend checking it out as soon as possible. I can't wait to try the hot dog, rotisserie chicken, and the sides."}
{"text":"Best tri tip in the city!!! Had a great experience, vibed out with the owner and enjoyed some donut bites (to die for)!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't even left and I'm already leaving this amazing review. Had the Porchetta sandwich and it was to die for! It's over flowing with delicious pork and the first bite was juicy and flavorful. The employees are all kind and caring and gave samples to try! This place is an absolute must for anyone who enjoys food :)"}
{"text":"The last time I had porketta like this I was 8 years old, at my home, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,  and my mother was cooking.  My mother would at least,  once or twice a month order a porketta roast from the local butcher on a Saturday morning on our weekly trip and he would bring out a pork butt, de-bone it, layer on the spices, roll it up, tie it up, and wrap it in butcher paper, write her name on it to be picked up the next Saturday for the Sunday dinner.  I would stare thru the butcher case watching him do his magic, waiting in anticipation for Sunday dinner next week.  Two weeks ago after having a \"meh\" waffle something next door, and upon leaving the waffle place,  my wife pointed out Karved to me.  We walked in and we were met with smiles and truly friendly greetings.  I spoke with this grey haired guy named Shawn with a ball cap,  explained my frustrations about \"porketta\" in the Las Vegas area.  I told him of the porketta I grew up with, he excused himself for about 2 min and then presented me with a \"sample\" of their porketta.  No complaining, but this sample could have fed two hearty souls.  Upon my first taste of the crispy, salty, perfectly spiced pork nuggets, I actually started to cry.  This is the pork that dreams are made of.  I was made whole again with my 8 year old \"me\".  He then gave my wife and I a more than ample sample of their, chicken noodle soup...it was as if my great grandma had just poured me a bowl.   If you want to find a piece of happiness from your youth in some Truly Excellent GREAT COMFORT FOOD, please try the hospitality and love that I received from Karved.  By the way, I purchased their porketta sandwich prior to leaving to take home for dinner.  Even though I let the porketta sandwich get to room temperature, the crusty roll, the arugula and the still crispy pork with their peppery dressing was freaking awesome."}
{"text":"Karved has a great selection of food and the quality of the meals was impeccable. Will check out the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to place for hearty gourmet sandwiches. From the moment you walk in, you are greeted by a smiling face. There are three huge butcher paper rollers on the left that is utilized as the menu board. Considering the place is tucked away in a strip mall behind the Target in Maryland and Flamingo, it is modern with its white tiles and streamlined design.   Their finest sandwich would be the porchetta sandwich with all of its porky goodness. If you get it to go, they will put the garlic vinaigrette the side so the bread won't get soggy. The chicken pita is super moist and juicy. I didn't think I would like it, but I really enjoyed it. The pickled red onions adds a brightness to pita wrap. The southwest chicken sandwich was also a nice surprise because I thought all the chicken would taste the same, but each was uniquely its own. The hummus hot dog is also a twist on the classic. All beef hot dog, spread of garlicky hummus and pickled red onions.  There isn't anything I have tried here and did not like. I am so glad there is a gourmet lunch spot for sandwiches with quality meats. I enjoy the clean atmosphere, friendly service and tasty selections. Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great food! Generous portions without sacrificing flavor, freshness, or originality. Great way to cure hunger after a weekend softball tournament. We'll be back on next visit to L.V. - thanks Karved!"}
{"text":"We strolled into Karved because of the yelp reviews. Wow!! These people are running a good business. It's creative and artistic. It's not run of the mill food. The food is fresh and has huge flavor. The sauces need to be in bottles and shipped to Texas!!! While eating, a local source brought in meat. It's original and high quality. The vibe was cool. Great stop."}
{"text":"Ever check out a menu and wonder... \"should I try it maybe I'll give it a shot one day\" today was the day and man was it worth it. I got the chicken Karved bowl and it was so good. They have this wonderful garlic sauce spread that goes great with bowl. We tried a few things. Was very pleased with everything we got and we will be returning. Great place to check out when your on this side of town. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Soooo yummy! They need to open one up in Summerlin. I've tried everything on the menu and you can't go wrong. The service was also amazing. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The service here is PHENOMENAL! I loved how friendly the service was and how fast the food came. I ordered their porchetta sandwich and the pita chips with hummus. I was surprised that these are not your typical pita chips. They are soft but have a nice crunch to it. They are fried in house and served with hummus. I loved the combo and this is something I would def order again. The only thing is that I did find them a tad bit oily.  The porchetta sandwich was good too. It is super filling and their meat portions are really hearty. This sandwich can be shared with at least one more person. Even though the sandwich is really good it is not the best pork sandwich I have ever had (its up there though). My whole order was $20 which is a bit up scale for a typical sandwich.  My friends ordered the chicken salad, pita wrap and French fries. They said they rated their meals 5 stars. Their plates looked really good!  If I am in the area I would def come back! Thanks for the awesome service and food!"}
{"text":"My first time here, and this place is REMARKABLE!  AMAZING fresh food, so creative, a rarity in Las Vegas. Great staff and great service! Move this place to the top of your list."}
{"text":"Posit, all great sandwiches (that we want to eat) are unhealthy.  Pastrami, corned beef, brisket, pulled pork,  a burger, italian salumi and porchetta.  Veg?  Sigh, if you must but make sure it's grilled and hammered to death or wilting from the meat fat.  Karved makes one heck of a great sandwich.  Porchetta.  Take a lean pork tenderloin.  Roll it inside a pork belly, it's skin on the outside.  Season heavily.  Rotisserie roast until golden brown, cracklin on the outside,  juicy, and fatty in all the right ways on the inside.  Slice that bad boy up.  Shove it in a fresh baked, chewy, crispy baguette, wilt up some greens, add a generous slathering of herbaceous, lemony, garlicky gremolata.  Heaven.  The crispy pork cracklin adds great texture while the sweetness of the pork is brought out by the bright gremolata.  An outstanding sandwich.  A solid value at $12.  Also available, a rotisserie chicken and tri-tip.  Ordered as a plate, the chicken is as good as any.  The tri-tip, well seasoned, cooked medium, tender, juicy, it's flavor brought to life by the spice heat of an aji verde (Peruvian green chili sauce).  OK roasted Brussels sprouts that could use more char for complexity.  All good, this place is all about the porchetta.  Friendly local service.  While I wouldn't say it's so epic and iconic, ie drive from Centennial great, if you're in the area, a very worthy treat."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews but am making an exception for this place. Only here for the day on business and looking for a good \"real\" sandwich off the strip. For reference, it's a $6 Uber from the stratosphere area. It's in a strip mall, but you aren't here for the location. Inside is basic and clean and looks nice. I got the porchetta sandwich, pita and hummus as well as brussel sprouts. Every ingredient of the sandwich was fresh made and you could see pork on the rotisserie in the background. It was a perfect balance of crispy and tender and salty at the same time. Bread was fresh and soft with the slightest crunch to its outside. It was probably one of the better sandwiches I have had in any recent memory I have. Portion was great and more than enough for a filling lunch. Brussel sprouts were great to have for a healthy option and were fresh and cooked perfectly in a generous portion. The pita chips were also fresh and better than I could have imagined. Usually chewy, these were almost airy and warm with a texture sort of like one of those mall giant pretzels. Combined with the smooth hummus it was an awesome side. The two girls who helped me were courteous, helpful, attentive and professional. Not much more you can say or ask for from \"counter help.\" Oh yea, had a 20oz Diet Coke and that was good too. Full of likely cancer causing chemicals but I blame myself, not Karved for that one."}
{"text":"Super nice people and cute store. Modern and neat, plus awesome food! The chicken was amazingggg and the owner gave us samples of soup and dessert!!! So nice and such good food"}
{"text":"Porchetta sandwich had good flavor but was very oily. It was leaking pretty hard.   Quarter chicken combo plate- chicken super dry af. Plain rice. Garlic sauce was good as were the Brussel sprouts but the whole plate was pretty bland. Maybe they just had over cooked the chicken but the whole plate was not a winner.   Was expecting a lot more considering the early 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"Okay if you would like a porchetta to die for go here. Call ask the chef and owner Joel when it will be ready and go!  It's prefect with its crisp skin and juicy meat. Cook right and cut right.   Friendly staff and very clean."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place gets anything less than a 5 star.  They are a simple restaurant offering literally, Karved deliciousness.  We have ordered out from here numerous times and have never had the chance to dine in because we have a newly paralyzed family member.  HOWEVER, even with that said, by the time we travel 10-15 minutes with the meal, get home and get it out to eat, it is amazing.  I can't imagine anything but next level delicious if you dine in to eat the Porchetta right when it's done.  The staff is SO nice, the friends we have recommended this spot to were treated kindly and were even given samples of the soup, unsolicited.  We have tried the veggie wrap (so refreshing), the Southwestern Chicken (delish) and the French Dip as well which was perfect too.  Our unified #1 winner winner, pork dinner, is THE PORCHETTA.  So, yum.  This place deserves 5 stars for food and for service, when we pick up, they've been nothing but kind, quick and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh and friendly food! I had their tri-tip sandwich along with Brussel sprouts and some of the cilantro soup and it was amazing. Every employee was super friendly and they sincerely smiled when greeting their customers. Awesome food, I can't wait to dine there again."}
{"text":"First, the staff was amazingly friendly, and the food was tasty.  The parking lot was a little tight, lots of cars for a Wednesday afternoon. The restaurant was very clean and inviting. We were offered a sample of their soup, both the chicken and spicy beef... and they were both outstanding! Served hot, not just warm, but hot which made it feel fresh and homemade.. I regret not getting a to-go container. We had the tri-tip plate, the sandwich, and an order of fries (with drinks) and it was almost 50 bucks.. which was a little pricey for lunch. The tri-tip was excellent, but was served with the garlic sauce that had good flavor but a weird consistency.. kinda like crisco cooking stuff... so it was weird to dip tri tip in the sauce. The fries were seasoned well, and they came with fry sauce that was tasty too! After we finished our meal the staff even offered us samples of the baklava and Greek frozen yogurt, which you could tell was homemade, fresh, and tasty! Overall, I'd visit again to try the rest of the menu, the price and the garlic sauce were really the only thing to even slightly complain about.."}
{"text":"The meat was extremely tender.  The sandwiches and soup was delicious.  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and staff as well as great location! The sandwiches were huge and super filling and the soup was to die for. The staff gave us free samples of the soup and also a free sample of the dessert. 10/10 must go !"}
{"text":"Went in on a late Monday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. The restaurant is clean, modern, and pretty spacious. Staff was really helpful and friendly.   I ordered the beef and dark meat chicken combo plate with Brussels sprouts and bell peppers as my sides. The staff member recommended I try garlic as my sauce since it's their most popular. Oh man, that garlic sauce was addicting. I slathered it on everything - the meat, the rice, the pita. I would've slathered that sauce on a piece of cake, it was that good. The chicken was so juicy and the seasoning on it was spot on. The tri-tip was tender but just a bit dry for my liking. Nothing that garlic sauce couldn't fix, though. The veggies were cooked on the soft side, which is how I like them. They added the perfect balance with the meat and rice.   Also, when I ordered, I was given a free sample of their chicken cilantro soup. The broth on that soup had some really well-developed flavors. There were hearty chunks of chicken and veggies in every spoonful. I would've ordered a bowl of it had it been a colder day. It would've definitely warmed me up.   I totally forgot to order the baklava ice cream so I'll be making another trip in the near future!"}
{"text":"Love porchetta, not a easy dish to find. Karved had porchetta and rotisseried tri tip. I didn't want a sandwich so I ordered a porchetta and tri tip plate which included basmati rice and two sides I went with roasted potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts which were both good.   The meats we're tender and the porchetta had a nice crispy skin which I wish I got more of. The amount of food in the plate was a lot.  The service also was very good even the chef owner coming out and asking how the food was. The place is right next to sakana sushi which I also frequent. If you love meat then this place is for you.   What I ordered wasn't on the menu it was $21 and some change that included a drink."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS! We ordered ahead & brought it home to eat (3 kids in tow) I ordered the Tri Tip sandwich & it was-seriously- the best. The beef was cooked perfectly, the onions were so deliciously carmelized & the sauce - don't even get me started on it. It was so freaking good I can't even!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everyone was so nice. They gave us little samples of their soups, frozen Greek yogurt, and baklava. Their homemade pita chips and hummus are absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the salad with chicken and the creamy house dressing, Brax had the Porchetta. Both were absolutely amazing. The chicken on the salad was tender and juicy, definitely fresh! And the sauce on the sandwich made the perfect touch. Both the staff and the owner were kind and very helpful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great aesthetics, food was wonderful,  fresh and fast. Presentation was too notch and they remembered my kids name to ask her how everything was. Fantastic place and my new go-to when folks ask where to try!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely exceptional! I ordered the roasted chicken pita with a side of basmati rice. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the vegetables were nice and fresh, as someone who has VERY high standards for pita bread, they totally nailed the bread, and their humus tasted homemade and fresh. I also ordered a side of their homemade garlic sauce and it was to die for.  On top of that, their service was top notch. I informed them that I am severely lactose intolerant and have several dietary restrictions due to health issues and the staff worked with me with no issues and were very informative and helpful. They even gave me a free sample of their homemade chicken and cilantro soup (which was delicious!) The owner was very kind and understanding of my issues and helped make sure everything went well for me.   If you are in Vegas and want to have a phenomenal meal without breaking the bank, especially if you have a lot of dietary restrictions like I do, I highly recommend you come here. Food was a perfect 10, the staff was a 20/10."}
{"text":"We placed a large pick up order yesterday, we did so based on the reviews and we were not disappointed. When my husband and I walked in the staff greeted us.. super friendly. They were surprise we place such a huge order without ever trying the food there. They thought it was for an office party but were surprised when I told them it was for my family. My siblings come out here quite often and are always looking for good places to eat.. as my husband put it they are \"food connoisseurs\" . Everyone loved the food!! We will definitely be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. I felt like royalty with my friend Chanelle. The food was as amazing as the photos I drooled over on yelp. (Photos not added because yelp has done justice to the food). This was like a home cooked meal by mama. The garlic sauce was amazing and the mash potatoes were delicious. I also enjoyed the chicken, tri-tip and porchetta with rice and brussels sprouts!!! I also had the cilantro soup. I say yes to all of it!! Totally will reorder!!! I had left overs and my Joey loved it too. This place is near my work and I am so excited to go again. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been delicious! I've had the chicken and beef plate and a couple different sandwiches. The hummus & pita and fries & fry sauce are a must. Thanks Karved for the superb food and service!"}
{"text":"My fiancé has been raving about this place for weeks and I finally got to try it on the last day of 2017 after we did a strenuous hike that morning.  Suffice it to say, we were both hangry and I'm glad that Karved was open because everything I ate confirmed what Mel had been proclaiming:  the food here is fabulous not to mention the customer service.  We started out with a sample of their Chicken Cilantro soup and it was quite hearty and comforting.  After perusing the menu, I decided on the combo with the rotisserie chicken and tri-tip, choosing as my two sides the brussel sprouts and black beans.  This meal already comes with basmati rice and 2 pieces of pita bread, too--so much!  It was all delicious and so filling!  On top of that, Paul, one of the owners, also gave us a sample of their Porchetta--great crispy pieces in there!  I was already getting full with everything I'd already sampled/eaten.  Mel had to help me finish the food I had when we then got to sample the frozen Greek yogurt with baklava topping--OMG!  I need more of this in my life!   I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.  The hype is real, people--get to Karved and you'll be kraving it, too."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while looking for a place for a healthy and tasty lunch- and it did not disappoint! I got the veggie pita and my boyfriend got the chicken sandwich, both were great, and the house made pita and hummus were the best I've ever had. The owner Paul has crafted a diverse menu with high quality ingredients and flavors, and clearly has a lot of passion to deliver an excellent experience. He had us sample a few other things on menu and everything was delicious. I'd definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Very few restaurants go above and beyond and this is one of them. Fast service yet you feel like you're having the most delicious home cooked food. The service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"We had porchetta sandwich and beef tri-tip plate. They were both pretty good. Porchetta sandwich was very juicy but bit oily. Beef tri-tip plate with garlic sauce was excellent. The servers were friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Nice to see healthy fast food is here to stay.  Gr8 progressive menu here.  The pork is amazing.  Salads are delicious.  Service is fast and friendly.  East side location is convenient.  Not a lot of seating but I love the food here.  Slow cooking at it's best but if you come late the food will be gone."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and so delish! If you're looking for something healthy and very tasty, I highly recommend this place. I love coming here for my lunch breaks :) Priscilla is always super nice and hardworking! The overall vibe here is great. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place out got the pork plate over rice. It was pretty good the sauce was on point. The food portion was perfect as well.. expect to see this place to come up if they lower the price a lil bit"}
{"text":"Why was this place empty when we came in for lunch?!?!  Every seat should be filled.  Every single one!  If you like porchetta sandwiches, then this is the place for you.  No joke, the best I've ever had.  The pork and pork belly had great contrasting textures, the arugula was plentiful, the lemon sauce and gremolata were perfect compliments to the fatty meats, the soft but crusty bread all of this sat upon was the perfect choice.  Excellent.  Outstanding.  Foodgasmic.  We also got quite a few other items and all of it was pretty good.  The roasted chicken was flavorful and tender.  The elote was really good.  The soups (we bought one and got a hefty sample of the other) were tasty.    The staff was super friendly and I really appreciate that."}
{"text":"Was an amazing mom and pop barbecue joint with a coffee shop style atmosphere. The pulled pork was delicious! Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Soooooooo good! Limited menu but what they do have is awesome! I had the roasted chicken pita and it was delicious. Plenty of food for any person. The French fries weren't traditional and they were delicious! We had the frozen yogurt for dessert and it was amazing!!!! I am definitely going back to try more of the menu. My friend has tried  almost everything on the menu and says you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I'm really looking forward going back."}
{"text":"Well hot diggty, ro-rotisserie. Karved has carved a special place in my heart and belly.   I've been eyeballing this place for awhile and am stoked to see it's doors are finally open. I'm especially thrilled because this spot is only a few minutes up the road from my pad. I'll be here often.   It's in the Target shopping center off Maryland Parkway, facing the street. The parking lot is small, but even on a Sunday afternoon, there were plenty of spots. The venue has a fresh decor with butcher paper menus that are easy to change and a counter that greets you instantly. It's a similar layout to a Subway, without the build it as you go implications.  The menu is mouthwatering. I shared the  ¼ lb All Beef Hot Dog with my roomate, sans the hummus. Super Mediterranean feel and loving that fresh french roll. The garlic sauce is too cool for school. Delicious. I enjoyed the Karved Roasted Chicken Pita all to myself. I may see if I can add or swap the creamy herb dressing with the garlic next time. It's that good.  The soup that day was the Cilantro Chicken. I partook in the sample she offered me and had I not already made plans to make soup in the crockpot that night, I totally would have ordered a tub of it to-go.  Welcome to the neighborhood Karved. You are a wonderful addition."}
{"text":"First off, the service was excellent! They went above and beyond and let me taste a side dish and a sauce I was not sure I'd like.  While we were eating, the chef came out and made his rounds. I could tell every member of staff really cared and wanted to make sure you had a great experience.  I felt like the food was decent. I had the 1/4 rotisserie chicken plate with black beans and roasted peppers. The chicken was good, except he wing was too toasted? Roasted? Rotisseried? (i.e. very dark skin) but still the breast wasn't dry. The beans were amazing. I'm guessing they are cooked from scratch and not out of a can because their texture was perfect. The bell peppers were pretty simple, but a little too oily without the char I was expecting from their \"roasted pepper\" name.   My fiance got the tri-tip medium rare with brussel sprouts and potatoes. Both of his sides were excellent and that's saying a lot because it's very rare for me to find brussel sprouts that I think aren't over cooked and over seasoned! The tri-tip was tasty but definitely not medium rare, more like medium well (It had the tiniest amount of pink. At first glance, it looked like it was cooked well done.)  Oh and you also get a sauce. The garlic sauce was tasty. It reminded me of a good garlic aioli. The verde sauce was just ok in my book. It was creamy, not the traditional salsa verde I really like; however, my fiance really enjoyed it. (It kinda reminded me of a sauce you'd get at a Chipotle which isn't what I want from a salsa.) I thought the food shined on it's open and didn't use much of either sauce.  I don't think I'll be back because it was a pricy for us. Two plates and two drinks with tip was about $40 for lunch. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not the amazing I'd want for that price.  If you're not on a budget and looking for some high-quality ingredients cooked pretty well, I'd say this is the place for you!  Edited to add: Servings were generous, I believe had enough that I had to take leftovers home. They do have less expensive options such as bowls and sandwiches."}
{"text":"CAN I GIVE THIS PLACE 100 STARS!!! Everything was cooked fresh and tasted AMAZING! Not only that but the staff was equally awesome!! Really nice, friendly and awesome to just chat with!! Ok, so on to the food. The Hummus BEST YOU WILL EVER HAVE IN YOUR LIFE! My 10 yr old son had the Porchetta (I didn't think he would eat the whole thing so I figured I could have it for lunch tomorrow) he ate ALL of it! I got to taste a few pieces of the meat and it was so tender and flavorful!! I had the chicken, Brussel spouts and potatoes. My husband had the tri-tip, chicken, Brussel sprouts, and beans. Needless to say so much food I still get a lunch for tomorrow. All the meat was cooked perfect and very tender and tasted great!!! The beans, potatoes and brussel sprouts all cooked and tasted AWESOME!! EVERYTHING was fresh and flavorful!! Ended the meal with the Frozen Greek Yogurt with Baklava Crumble, perfect ending for a perfect meal!! Thanks everyone at Karved we will surely go back!!"}
