{"text":"Shout out to the guy who brought over some printed menus the other day, otherwise I would have never known about this place.  Love having Anthony's as an option for a quick lunch delivery when we are slaving away at our downtown office during the week.  Next time I order I'm throwing in a cannoli or two!"}
{"text":"A good place to go grab some grub. The menu is plentiful, they have just about anything you want to eat. You get breakfast ( breakfast burrito) the way to go. Pizza for lunch ( pepperoni) is good, and for dinner the half pound Angus burger. Food, customer service, and employee's are great!!!! Thank you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you for making jury duty a little less painful! Staff is friendly and the food is fantastic! Really a breath of fresh air after having to deal with jury duty and stuffy government employees!"}
{"text":"Best ny pizza white pizza is to die for. When you walk in the smell takes you back to new york real pizza . Draw back not open on weekends for us downtowners."}
{"text":"Wow great  pizza and the fresh baked cookie is to die for. A two hands salute to the friendly staff. Now I know where to go whenever I'm at this area. Congrats guys job well done"}
{"text":"We are originally from the NY area snd this is real NY food. We had chicken Parmesan and spaghetti and meatballs. Great sauce, great meat. Super reasonable pricing and super friendly owner and staff."}
{"text":"Their entire menu is amazing. I haven't tried anything that wasn't amazing. The only down side is that it is pricely for lunch but everything is made fresh. The owner works there everyday and takes pride in the business."}
{"text":"great food, great prices!
Great idea, pizza slice with chicken fingers"}
{"text":"Ok I love trying new places and I stopped here to grab a bit. It was over priced and not so yummy I'm open to all cultures and all foods I've been to Newyork many times nothing's Newyork about this rude guys"}
{"text":"I went in last week for lunch because I heard good reviews. When I finally got to the middle of the line, an older Hispanic man took my order with nothing but attitude and an attitude to which he didn't want to help me. When I finally got my lunch special which was two slices and a drink, it was wrong. When I went back and talked to  the same man who took my order, and told him that it was wrong and not to my liking; he then told me that it was exactly what I ordered.  He then turned around and walked away.  I found this to be incredibly rude and just our right wrong.  A younger gentleman heard what I was saying and asked me what problem was.  When I told him my problem, he offered to fix it and apologized profusely for the situation that had happened.  He was very nice for doing what he had done.  However, I will not be returning to Anthony's because of the rude gesture and actions of the older Hispanic gentleman."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in my order from them today.   Ordered the pizza special with Canadian bacon and pineapple for delivery.  Both were thrown on top of a previously baked pizza with no cheese added.  In fact it wasn't Canadian bacon but rough cut large unevenly diced chunks of ham.  I asked multiple people in the office and they had never seen anything like it.  Wish I could upload a picture. I usually eat there at least once a week so I tried to call and talk to a manager.  The phone was answered with please hold in an annoyed voice, followed by another person picking up the phone with a yeah.  I asked to speak to a manager and was told the person who put me on hold was the manager.  I repeated that I needed the manager and was informed that both the manager ( who was yelling in the background I don't have time for this) and the employee didn't have time to talk to me.   HORRIBLE customer service won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Meatball sub special is my go to but everything I've had is great! Nice staff and clean."}
{"text":"Best NY Style pizza in Las Vegas!!!! I'm from Brooklyn NY and this pizza and Cannoli are tastes of home!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.. best pizza!!!  Plus they have the most amazing Cannoli's ever!! cant wait to go back. super friendly service too. Thanks!"}
{"text":"New pizza place downtown, and it's great.  New York style pizza with a good menu of pasta and sandwiches.  I get two slices with sausage and a Coke for under $7.  I've worked downtown for a long time and have been waiting for a place like this.  Say hi to Anthony working the oven, he's a great guy and works hard to get you a great meal."}
{"text":"Had very high hopes for this place based on a number of great reviews and the fact the I love NY style pizza. Ordered a large pie with pepperoni, sausage and mushroom at lunchtime. Although it wasn't bad, it's definitely not in the same league as pizza from John's, Lombardi's, Grimaldi's, etc. in NY. Personally, I think the sauce was under-seasoned, the crust too thick and also too dry. It was also slightly under-cooked with no char on the crust. 

I would like to go back and give them another chance. Maybe I just got there on a bad day."}
{"text":"Was downtown working and went walking to find a place for lunch. Ran into this place and glad I did. Ordered a cheeseburger special (fries and a drink included) - 8.99 not a bad price. Was really surprised at how good everything was. Burger was juicy and tasty - fries were hit and fresh. Would recommend and come back for sure"}
{"text":"New York style pizza! Located right across the courthouse, great location, lots of foot traffic for this place.  Met the owner, he was working the ovens, nice guy, driven and ambitious.  The pizza was exactly what you expect from a NY style pizza; large and meaty!"}
{"text":"I don't really like pizza but I LOVE THIS PIZZA!!!!

Anthony's started off on the right foot by giving out free slices of pizza, or a whole pie if you were taking it back to the co-workers.  It only got better from there...

Delicious pizza, great fresh toppings, and a quick lunch option downtown!  The french fries are excellent.  There's too much chicken to eat when you order chicken strips.  The lasagna is yummy and the salads look great!

The staff is wonderful, they remember you and your order and the service is always quick even when they're busy.  If you work downtwon the trick is to call in your order and pick it up about 10 minutes later.  They'll let you skip to the front of the line to pay and your pizza will be waiting when you walk in the door.  

My personal favorite = sliced meatballs + onions.  The pizza itself if the perfect balance of excellent cheese and sauce  that isn't too sweet.  The meatballs are better than regular sausage because they're perfectly seasoned and don't fall off your pizza :)"}
{"text":"Went during lunch. It was ok. Nothing fabulous. Had the slice and salad."}
{"text":"A nice surprise at lunch break from jury duty. Just like stepping into a pizza/sub shop in New York or Philly. My Rueben (with pastrami instead of corned beef) could have served two. Almost worth having jury duty. Almost."}
{"text":"My friends and I walked over here from work the other day because we were craving some wings for breakfast that day. We were immediately impressed by their hospitality. We were wondering what the wing sauces tasted like and the employee gave us a few different sample tasters. They were all delicious so we proceeded to order 30 wings for $29.99! On our way out we asked for some bleu cheese dressing and they hooked us up with a couple at no extra charge. For us, it's the small things that count and we were won over. We will definitely be back to try their wide variety of a menu and fair prices!"}
{"text":"Really good quality food for a low price! The portions for the lunch specials are big, too. The owners were extremely friendly, kind and attentive. A nice lil place to get food with friends"}
{"text":"Would have gave this place five stars. But to me presentation and getting the order right should be a priority when it comes to food or to restaurants in general. 

So I made a delivery order for a bbq chicken pizza.  When I opened the box all the bbq and chicken were on the sides of the box rather than on the pizza. Just seems like it was probably placed somewhere slanted. So I pretty much had to scrape all the toppings of the box and place them on the pizza just to eat it. 

Also I ordered two bottles of water and never got them but I paid for them. The delivery guy offered to get them for me but why would I want that? So I can wait another 45 mins to get water? No thanks. 

This is disappointing because the pizza is actually good which is why I gave it a 2 star and not an 1 star. However, forgetting things that I paid for and presenting me with a sloppy ass pizza just says a lot about how much you care about your customers. 

Probably be the last time I order from this place."}
{"text":"Exceptional NY pizza.  Best I've had since leaving NY.  The service was exceptional and the pizza, the pizza was as good as any that I've had in NYC.  The crust was thin and done perfectly.  The sauce was tasty and not acidic.  The cheese was quality and baked to perfection.  The slice was foldable, just how it's to be eaten in NY.  I'll be back next time to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great little pizza shop downtown across from the courthouse. 

They have breakfast items like bagels a spreads for the morning crowd and lunch specials for all the hungry court employees."}
{"text":"This place gets the new York style pizza. Great service, nice people, they know what is up with customer service."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. I usually order the omelet. Their omelets are fluffy and filling. The man (no hair) and women (only one I usually see) whos helped us are super duper nice. They sincerely like what they do, or at least they know how to turn on awesome customer service. They make you feel like family.....for sure you must try to come here and try their food!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great customer service. Try the chicken fingers with the kickin' bourbon sauce!"}
{"text":"Delicious lunch option by LVJC for a good price. I got a slice of pizza, three pieces of chicken and a drink for less than ten bucks. The pizza is on the thinner side but had a good crust. I think it could have used more cheese on mine but it was still yummy. The chicken was good, ordered them hot and spicy. I was too full to try dessert but this place seems authentic. Great service too."}
{"text":"Anthony's was really close to my hotel. Only 5 mins away. Walked in and felt really welcome. Atmosphere is really chill. I met rob and j, who are really nice guys. I bohht some mild chicken wings and a XL Bbq chicken pizza, and man... Rob know how to cook a mean pizza.  Thoroughly enjoyed it and will be back!!"}
{"text":"The ANYP&D
If your on a diet smh you will murder your diet here! OMG good pizza! Great Pizza the best Pizza oh yeah! Sometimes I get a lil angry when my husband points out places such as this because he knows I'm on a diet. Ok so I'm weak. I ate it and yes as I put  my left hand on the bible and put up my right hand. I swear this pizza is so OMG good. Sad to say should u go here you may catch me eating pizza here :("}
{"text":"I went to Anthony's pizza and deli got lunch on 1/9/18 good food and the staff take excellent care of their customers 110 percent Bodacious"}
{"text":"Anthony's is a tiny hole-in-the-wall, downtown pizza place that serves up tasty pies. They have a great lunch special that includes two slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $5 and some change. There are so many pizza places in the Downtown area, but Anthony's is my go-to lunch pick. Stop by if you want a quick, cheap, and tasty lunch near the courthouse."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the rating for this is as good as it is.  The pizza was just fine, but the service was shitty.  On hold for 15 mins and then I called back.  Guy seemed to have forgotten we were on hold.  He didn't listen properly when we told him which entrance of the building to come to.  Driver was confused.  Pizza was cold and sucked.  Owner was supposed to call but never did.  Never ordering from here.  Fuggetaboutit.  Broadway we should have never tried something different.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I never write bad reviews but this was honestly one of the worst pizzas I've had in a long time.  There was literally no flavor, none.  There were four of us eating and we all said the same thing.  We had a pizza, fries, and a sandwich.  All three were bland and the pizza was soggy.  Not to mention that they are way higher priced than any of the other pizza places around here.  Sad :("}
{"text":"food is amazing!!! they have great lunch specials & the owner is such a hard worker, def knows how to take care of his customers. 
I recommend this place , best pizza ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place hits the spot for pizza and wings and they do other foods like a philly cheese steak. They are extremely humble and are there for you. They greet you and are more than happy to assist you if you just ask :) I got 30 wings and they gave me plenty of ranch and blue cheese where as bdubs or wingstop charges per sauce. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Anthony's. When I eat lunch here, I usually get the spaghetti lunch combo. It's pretty simple, but always really good. I've also had the chicken strips and the chicken Parmesan sandwich, both of which were great as well. Lately, I've been coming mostly for breakfast. I had an omelet with spinach once that was a little on the watery side for my taste, like they hadn't drained/squeezed the spinach well enough maybe. But most of the time, I get the two eggs and potatoes, sometimes with bacon. The potatoes are cooked on the flattop with onions and green peppers. Quite good."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I work right around the corner, so I love ordering from them! I usually always get the caprese salad with extra bread, which is YUMMY, but make sure you've got some minty gum...it's drenched in garlic, which I love! Today, I ordered the greek salad and a cannoli. I loved the salad. This was the first time I've had a cannoli, so I don't have anything to compare that to, but I really enjoyed it. :) Definitely a place to order from!"}
{"text":"Oh boy oh boy oh boy, another awesome NY style pizza joint!!!  
I ordered the lunch special of a slice, side salad with drink, the lasagna with drink and 3 warm chocolate chip cookies. 

I ordered delivery through DoorDash and it arrived in a timely fashion.  So I didn't have to warm up the pizza and they got the NY crust just right!  The sauce was not too salty (I just had an Enzo's slice yesterday and it was way too salty), it was just right.  Good amount of cheese and the slice was huge!  
The cookies were delish!  Perfect ending to lunch.  

Saved the lasagna for dinner and there was tons of sauce and cheese.  Yum yum!  This is my new favorite NY pizza joint!"}
{"text":"My office eats here quite a bit since it's down the street.  The service is excellent and the food is good.  Prices are very reasonable.  Their chicken fingers are my favorite.  Pizza is alright (but I'm not really a fan of NY style pizza...it's kinda bland to me).  All around a solid joint!"}
{"text":"This pizza establishment is the real deal! Ordered the Jalapeño poppers with a large veggie pizza. It's to die for! The flavors are spot on, the ingredients are fresh, the pizza is hand made to order. I also recommend the spicy chicken fingers and the calzone! Great, fast service at the right price! Great job!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  So I ordered my usual two slices of pizza with pepperoni and a drink. On the way back to the office the wind was blowing like crazy and it grabbed my pizza box, opened it and I dropped my pizza on the ground. They say this and made me two new slices at no charge.

Not only is the food out of this world, but the staff are as well. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Anthonys new York pizza and deli the food was excellent and the staff was way cool a very good bodacious place to eat downtown las vegas n.v."}
{"text":"Anthony's Pizza is New York style and delicious.  I am also a big fan of their chicken parm sub, modified with some wing sauce:)

I wrote this review because I wanted to share a story about their customer service.  They delivered the wrong order to me today, and before I could call them to complain, they delivered my correct order.  Well played Anthony's!"}
{"text":"Great food. Exceptional service. Very friendly. Great food. We ordered a burger, tenders, and a sandwich. Delicious. Pastrami was outstanding."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here to our office the other day. It was VERY good. We ordered 2 XL cheese pizzas (true NY style), an antipasto salad, mozzarella sticks, and some soft drinks. The pizzas were the real deal. The slices were huge. They fold over your hand as you're eating it. Thin NY slices with cheese and covered in seasoning. The salad was good. It wasn't anything worth writing home about but it was good. The meat and ingredients were definitely fresh. Originally we had ordered the jalapeno poppers but they were out so we substituted for the mozzarella sticks. They were just your plain jane (probably frozen) mozz sticks. They were truly the only disappointment. Our total was $75 but it fed a small office of 6. Some even lasted into the next day for lunch."}
{"text":"Big supporter of this place. 

The slices are very good -- great, slightly doughy crust, good sauce.

More so, though, the location downtown and layout of the shop can make you forget (for a moment) that you are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"5 very small fingers and fries tasted like the oil used was old. Ranch was very runny. I ate enough to satisfy my hunger, but threw the rest away.  The two stars are for the driver because although it was hard to understand what she was saying because of the language barrier, she did try."}
{"text":"This place has great food, but it's a bit pricey for lunch, in my opinion and there is usually a long wait to get your food. The Pizza is always fresh and delicious and the salads are a good sized portion and the sandwiches always look great. The wait isn't really their fault because they're always so busy, but I $14 for a salad and a drink is a bit on the expensive side. I think it's because they charge $5 to add chicken. I'll eat there again, but probably just stick with a slice rather than try to be healthy, haha."}
{"text":"Have been here twice. 
Very wide selection. They even have breakfast which I have yet to try. Canolis are amazing. If Im ever down town this place has plenty of options. Sometimes it's quite crowded and the wait is a bit longer but that's ok with me!"}
{"text":"I work at a law firm downtown, so my coworker Lucy and I are regular customers. We stop by Anthonys at least once or twice a week and order chicken fingers and fries or the cheese slices. The employees are always happy and eager to help. Anthony is also always super friendly. The food is DELICIOUS and prepared in a timely manner. I love Anthonys and will continue to be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Finally another downtown option!  I tried this place when they had a soft opening and we're giving away free slices a couple months back.  They have officially opened!  I got one of the lunch specials, two slices and a drink for $5.50.  They have a pretty extensive menu with subs, pasta, salads, wings, fries, etc.  Prices seem reasonable and they deliver if you happen to work downtown as I do.  They were extremely busy since they just opened but my order was ready fairly quickly.  They have some inside seating and a couple tables outside."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint at all. I got there at the peak of lunchtime and got my two slices in less than five minutes.
The staff is very friendly and the pizza exceeded my expectations.
I'm definitely coming back in the future."}
{"text":"This is a cool place Downtown for some pizza and wings. It's right across from the court house and I'd recommend stopping by for a bite if your interested in some New York style pizza.

The slice of pizza I had was good, but the main reason I came was I heard the different favors of wings were worth the trip. I did try the bourbon wings and I'd come back for them again. It was awesome that the cashier let me taste a couple of the other flavors before ordering too. 

I also got a cannoli which was delicious, to which I'd like to say whoever made it knew what they were doing."}
{"text":"First of all the deli was closed for 3days during thanksgiving week. then on the last day(cyber monday) finally the pizzeria was open, so I ordered the large veggie pizza and hoping it was worth waiting for 3days. I was wrong, it had no taste, it had less cheese and more of watery  portion of the sauce and NO taste at all."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place and was disappointed. First my delivery took 1.5 hours, okay they get busy. I can understand that.

Then my pizza was cold and my salad was warm. To make it worse I found a hair in my salad.  

The pizza was good even though it was cold. I won't be eating here again though."}
{"text":"The best pie I've had in Las Vegas!

The crust was perfectly crisp on the bottom, and had a great chew.  The sauce was not too sweet, nor too tangy, and the cheese was off the hook!

I should have asked Anthony where he got his pepperoni from as I would definitely change brands for my home made pies.

$29.00 for a 16\" pie and 4 drinks...4 people fed for that price in Vegas?  Super deal!

Anthony is a great guy.  Super friendly, and works the crowd between pies. Free advice:  Hit 'em up before or after lunch.  Yes it gets that busy."}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Las Vegas near the court house and the detention center, that's right all the hot spots. The pizza is fantastic, and the chicken fingers are truly a thing to behold. They have great lunch specials, check them out when you get there, they change.  It can get a little crowed around lunch time, but it is worth it. So if you find yourself on jury duty, stop in for a quick lunch. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"The customer service is genuinly very friendly. 
The hot wings were very good, I would recommend. The pizza however is below average for me.  I guess I prefer Chicago style pizza. 
Next time we'll order the wing's again & perhaps lasagne or a sandwich. 
They do have a big menu. Located right near the court house."}
{"text":"I've been eating Tony's pizza since I was a kid! Love this place, the pizza and the canoli's!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for an early lunch had a meatball sub which was good. The fries were ok nothing special. My wife had a couple slices of pizza and the peppers and onions were grilled before being placed on top, very good."}
{"text":"If you like New York style pizza this place is a hidden gem in Downtown...Located across from the court house on Lewis & Casino Center, they are one of the best I have found in town.

They are open Monday through Friday only from 7am to 6pm, but if you can make it downtown during the week, this is a place to check out.  Parking is a bit of a challenge as there is no free public parking lot, but I tell you it is worth the trip.

They have lunch special's which run daily until 4pm which means 2 large cheese slices with a drink is only $5.50 until 4pm.

Everyone I have talked to during my visit today has told me everything they have is excellent.  You won't find a bad item on the menu and Anthony is a very cool person to hang and chat with.  

I highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday at the suggestion of some work friends. I was very impressed with the service and the food that I received. I ordered a calzone with chicken and ham. This thing was enormous! Everything was made fresh and to order. It took some time, but I am happy to wait for freshly cooked food. One of my friends had an issue with his order, but was taken care of quickly and with no problems. You have to appreciate customer service like that. I would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza and deli in town!"}
{"text":"Went here on a break from jury duty and got a lunch special. It was reasonably priced and great food. Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I had jury duty so came here for lunch! Had the meatball sandwich and it was alright nothing special. Next time I'll try the pizza. It looked really good"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Boy did this place have me fooled!! I did not expect the food to taste as good as it did!! What an unexpected surprise!! I am now a fan of Anthony's NY Pizza Deli!! I recognized the logo from the numerous pizza boxes I see on a daily basis inside the community fridge,at the office I work at in downtown. I had to try for myself. Tasty New York style pizza...hot, fresh, made-to-order thin & crispy!! Just how I like it!!! I now understand why this place is a popular lunch spot!! Fantastic lunch specials and friendly service too!!! Minus 1 star as this place could use a little more effort on clean-up after the lunch rush is over."}
{"text":"Pizza was what you expect from New York style pizza joint. People were friendly and food came out quick! Prices were good!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! True NY style. Very friendly service. Right across the street from the courthouse. If I hadn't served as a juror I wouldn't have ever known about this joint. Wish they had their own parking lot though. There are a couple 15 minute loading/unloading spots right in front, but during the busy lunchtime they're usually taken. Best time to stop by is probably after 2 pm, when everyone is back in court. The downside is they're only open Monday thru Friday. They also serve pizza by the slice and they have fantastic cannolis!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great! Had it delivered after a long week in town for a conference. 

The peppers and onions were grilled, and totally delicious. 

In my opinion, it's not NY pizza, but it was more than well worth it! Will totally order here again when in town later this year."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great spot for a quick lunch - this is it. Their lunch specials are PHENOMENAL. 

You can easily get full for less than $10. My personal favorite is the #10 - 3 chicken tenders, a slice of pizza, and a drink. It's my go to when I'm in the office and can't decide what I want to eat. 

I have yet to be disappointed by their food when dining there but the space can get a little tight with the lunch traffic's coming through but the service and kitchen is super quick. 

It's not like the best pizza I've ever had - it's thin crust and the slices are sized very decently but I really would say that for the area and the pricing on the menu - it's awesome for a quick lunch or food on the go. 

I would also stick with the pizza. Wasn't impressed by the sandwiches or their fries (just not my style) but the tenders and pizza rolls are also bomb."}
{"text":"This place is just straight up outstanding. I came here with a couple of girlfriends and 4 kiddos at 8:00pm after visiting Container park. The lady working was super busy, but still accommodated us right away. I did not get her name, but she was very sweet. We had pizza and wings, and they were both bomb! I would easily return here anytime I'm in the area. I don't usually give many reviews, but for this place it is well deserved."}
{"text":"Pizza is okay and the staff who makes the food is decent, but the wife of the owner, who works there, has a very poor attitude, and is mean to people.   And the owner who works there is afraid to stand up to her.   She does not appreciate good customers whatsoever, who help keep the place running.   It's shameful.   The quality of the sandwiches and salads can also be improved."}
{"text":"Great pie... owner very friendly...sliced meatball and green bell peppers on pie was great... sandwich  looked great also. Closed Saturday and Sunday....One of the top NY. Style pies in Vegas. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Actually great NY-style pizza and not just a novelty act- which it certainly is."}
{"text":"We ordered food for pick up. It was a short walk from the Golden Nugget hotel, less then 7 minutes. We ordered the fried ravioli, two slices of cheese pizza, and a Philly cheesesteak. Being that I'm from NY, I know a NY pizza slice when I see one and this wasn't it lol. Normally NY slices are huge with lots of cheese. These pizza slices were decent, but not as big as a NY slice. When we arrived the staff was generous enough to provide me the free drink offered on Yelp. The prices were reasonable and the food satisfied our hungry appetite. They did have several tables for seating and a tv to view the sports game. I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a quick bite to eat.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The best Sicilian pizza I ever ate! The mozzarella, sauce and dough are so much like NYC. Awesome for the picky pizza eater. Can't wait to try the regular pie."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! Very professional, helpful and polite!!! Rob was such a delight to order from and it is very evident he has great rapport with the locals! Kudos!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place as a dine in restaurant  but I am extremely  disappointed in the delivery. I work in an office downtown less than 2 blocks from this place. I knew I was going to have a busy day and decided to order lunch for a staff meeting (one large pizza and some soda...our office is small). I called the order in at 11:10 and was told it would be a 35 delivery. It is now 12:35 and my order still has not been delivered.  I called at 12:10 to find out the status of the order and was told it was coming very soon. I have a hungry staff who will not get to enjoy their lunch during the lunch hour. Lesson learned  just say no to Anthonys  delivery."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetarian pizza and added pepperoni and ham. The pizza arrived with out any vegtables at all... and only a few piceses of meat. Really!!"}
{"text":"I've been called for my civic duty; I was selected. In doing so, I've been stuck in a court room unable to bring lunch or food. 

Pulling out my faithful Yelp app, I looked for dining options close to the courthouse that wouldn't break the bank and was quick so I could return back to the court house at the assigned time.

Anthony's came up and it's literally across the street from the main entrance. Truly has a New Year feel. Several men working their asses off, tossing dough, saucing wings, and making magic happen.

Portions are rather large for wings and fingers, pizza slices are big, but not huge, definitely a 2 slice spot. They offer soups, sandwiches, wings, fingers, and a few other Italian specialties. There is also a daily special as well as several lunch specials.

Not fancy, but serving up good pies, makin' their own ranch, and everything else from scratch. If you're downtown and stuck doing you're civic duty or you've had an unfortunate run in with the law, make this you to-go to spot for a bite.

BONUS TIP: Don't jaywalk here from the courthouse. The police is all over the place here and they will issue JAY WALKING tickets."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I definitely come down here whenever I visit downtown! The atmosphere and food here is great!! There is such a great selection to choose from it blows my mind! The fact that it is all freshly made and you can see them making your food really makes this place and the food even better! The staff has excellent customer service skills and goes the extra mile for their customers!  Whether I order delivery or come in, I always have a great experience! Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Downtown Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"As many of you know I've said it time and time again I am extremely picky when it comes to meat!!!
I can't take the credit for finding this hidden gem... my father was here visiting and wanted a good Philly sandwich. He found Anthony's online and said he wanted to try it out!
It's a little difficult for parking but once you find parking it's definitely worth it.... we walked in and were greeted by I really nice gentleman... I didn't catch his name! But we all ordered the Philly sandwich with fries and drinks! I knew it was going to be good because they have Boar's Head meat and to me that is the only meat to have in any kind of Deli!!! The sandwiches came out... cooked perfectly... the meat was seasoned slightly the cheese was nice and melty!!! The best part though was the bell peppers and onions were cooked to perfection!! They were nice and soft and Blended perfectly in with the meat... and surrounding the perfect mixture of meat onions and bell peppers and cheese was a light flaky hoagie roll. The only thing that I can say I would have liked was a little bit more moisture. Maybe a tiny bit of ajus sauce... other than that...it was a perfect sandwhich!!! Was a big hit with my parents and my man...he had his with mushrooms too...he said it was perfect balance of everything!
We will definitely be back!
Side note...they make a heart shaped pizza if you ever needed one...great idea!!! ;)"}

{"text":"Just what I was looking for. We were in Las Vegas for a hockey tournament, staying at the Golden Nugget. We were on East Coast time with late games and  the hotel food was expensive. This place had breakfast all day, pizza, pasta, subs, salads and wraps at normal prices. The food was also very good. We ate there Fri and Sat morning unfortunately it's closed on Sun. Locals from the municipal buildings nearby eat there."}

{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Anthony's! The owner is busting his butt every day and really cares about his restaurant, customers, and food. The food is hot, fresh, and delicious every time. I have eaten more of their chicken and pizza lunch specials than I care to admit to, but I have NEVER been disappointed. The staff is friendly, funny, and hardworking. 

My co-worker is from Philly, PA, and walked in with me one day to order a cheeseburger sandwich, which he hadn't been able to find on a menu since moving to Las Vegas. I had never heard of it (being from California) and didn't see it on the menu. But the cook and cashier new EXACTLY what he was asking for and made it special just for him, thrilled that he had ordered it. 

That's the kind of spirit you can expect at Anthony's."}
{"text":"Delicious super thin pizza slices. I got the 2 cheese slices with fountain drink lunch special for $5.99. My slices were ready before I was done filling my fountain drink. Really reminded me of my hometown NY pizza. Great place for lunch if your stuck at court all day."}
