{"text":"Worst chinese food ever . Dont go this place. Im chinese and i think only the white rice there is good."}
{"text":"Xi teng wo zi ji. I have waited for 1 hour. Wo yao zai lai wo tm jiu shi sb. Never come to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Definitely understaffed. 30 minutes wait with no water served. Won't ever come again because of the service. The food and environment is just okay. I doubt if the pictures on the menu are taken by themselves."}
{"text":"Our chickens was not fully cooked and when we requested to reheat it, the waitress was very rude and asked me why don't I say anything earlier (we ate 1/3 of them). I'm not really sure how much semi raw chicken I ate:( I hope we don't get sick later."}
{"text":"Traditional Chinese food. The raw materials are really fresh. The restaurant is beside to the Chinese market. Recommendation: Zenzen Taste Fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Pretty authentic Chinese food that also tastes delicious. Not too heavy or oily, and the prices are fair, as well. We come here when we want a nice, yummy, sit down Chinese meal. We also bring visitors and guests here."}
{"text":"Zen zen taste, taste good!!! If you want traditional Chinese food, go there as soon as possible."}
{"text":"This is a  very good Chinese restaurant as it is not Americanized. I stopped in last week for lunch and had veg fried rice with beef...very flavorful, layers of flavor . I also had the enoki mushroom cold salad which was spicy and flavorful. My group shared the sweet and sour soup (serves 5 people) which was good.  I tasted the eggplant and cauliflower dishes and they were really good too.  Prices are very reasonable and their servings are large.
The atmosphere is a a bit dingy and the foyer is dirty, so those could  be improved. Over all I think this is one of  the best Chinese restaurants in Madison ."}
{"text":"It was Friday night and only one server there. The service was very slow. But the worst thing is the only server has really bad temper. 
Beijing fish flavored pork slices ?????? was horrible. It said it is a Beijing resteraunt. I am from Beijing and I will definitely say it is not traditional Beijing foods at all!!!!! 
At the end, my friend was so angry because the server asked for 15% tips while there was no service at all!!!!! I can not understand why the review here is so high on yelp."}
{"text":"Very good. I love their cauliflower and spicy fish. Some dishes have too many pepper corn I guess, very \"ma\"."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food. Recommend Dumplings, so good. Source dish is salty. Pumpkin with fried egg york is good too. Boils spicy beef is ok. Fish head is oily."}
{"text":"I love this place, and that's the best Chinese restaurant in Madison!! I love their signature fried rice. I also asked the chef, he says he can cook something off menu, like Peking duck, and chicken soup."}
{"text":"Truly authentic Chinese food.  Highly recommend cauliflower dish, eggplant dish, Peking pork, dumplings, braised pork with egg, green beans... Perhaps not authentic but the blueberry yam dish was interesting and quite tasty. All of the above were per owner's recommendation, and they were all excellent! Also had the spicy chicken dish which was numbingly spicy (if you're into that stuff). Definitely a place I would recommend to others!"}
{"text":"We went there around 7pm and there was no customer. They have a small selection but the menu is fancy with all pictures that gonna make there real dish a disappointment. We ordered a spicy pot and guess what? For $32 we got a dish loaded with cheap meat balls and it tasted like spoiled. Definitely would not come back."}
{"text":"This initial rating is based on my first experience here. I will update it if I re-visit. 

I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. It was nicely decorated and when you enter, there is a front desk like you are entering a hotel. There are upstairs seatings and a private room on the main floor. 

Unlike other typical chinese restaurants, where the tables have sauces, pepper, salt etc., this place has none. Just clean tables. Bench seats along the wall and nice chairs. There was also no TV but be prepared to see other Chinese patrons talking loudly and playing their video shows while they eat - just like a typical chinese restaurant. 

Upon approaching the main door, an electronic version of fur Elise will play in the restaurant. This is to let the wait staff know someone is coming in and they can hustle to greet them. No one is at the front desk to greet. First time I heard it I thought it was cool. Then with each guest coming in, the loud music played overheard until It got very annoying. Their staff can't tell if someone just left or someone is coming. 

I got excited when I saw that there were photos of the dishes in the menu. The charcoal lamb chops looked so good that 3 separate tables ordered it. Warning - photos in menu is not representative of the actual dish. 

The charcoal lamb chops took a while to come out. When it did, It was pathetic. Super dry, 4 bones with very little meat because it was cooked way over done. Drizzled over the bones were crushed peppercorn, smoky and not spicy. 2 of the bones even had the skin on it and don't try to chew the skin unless you have steel jaws and iron teeth. I thought it was just my dish but the next table got the same thing and commented on the skin too. $20 for 4 pcs of over cooked lamb chops is over priced. My battery ran out before I could take a photo of that dish. I also overheard the other table saying one dish is too salty and the other is too sour. 

Anyway, I would not recommend the charcoal lamb chops. I might return to try other didhes."}
{"text":"Very nice place! Locate next to the J&P market, which allows you to shopping there and finish your lunch/dinner before or afterwards. Food are delicious and are REAL Chinese dishes since I have just hired a chef from China. The most impressive part is that you can expect your dishes present within 10 minutes after you place your order. In addition, if you have a big stomach, you can have 2 bowls of rice without any extra charge. Overall 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Heaven!

I'm a  long-time SF resident  and have been looking for an authentic Chinese restaurant (you name the regional cuisine) ANYWHERE in the midwest for ever.

This is NOT where you get your Egg Foo Yun or whatever.   In fact, the young man serving us didn't quite believe we knew how to use chopsticks.  

BUT THE FOOD!   We had the sauteed Bok Choy, Spicy Eggplant, and a pork dish whose name I can't remember - AMAZING.  Spicy, flavorful, each dish it's own unique delight.   

It's small and understaffed, but I forgive them.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the place where Tsinghua alumni association gather together each time--celebration for Chinese lunar new year, college anniversary and welcome new arrivals. We like the delicious dishes (BTW, although sometimes some dishes are less and without characteristics) and the good environment. The second floor is neat, clean and comfortable so that we can make dumplings by ourselves every year."}
{"text":"\"Bridging multicultural fusion: Begin with food and go beyond...\" touts (one of) their website(s), but really, you can end with food too.  Why?  It's just that good.  Any place which can make my lips literally buzz from the spices in mapo doufu is a winner in my book, even if they don't \"go beyond\" like some Buzz Lightyear wannabe."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a grocery store, this is a hidden gem. BF and I had garlic pork and a pot mushroom dish. The garlic pork was fabulous. The pot mushroom dish was good-a bit chewy but I think it was supposed to be that way.

BF was finicky about the rice-he thought it was sticky.  I'm not as finicky about the rice so I thought it was decent. We also got a bowl of egg drop soup, which came in a really huge bowl. We each got 3 to 4 small bowls of soup out of it. It also had little pieces of corn in it, which I liked. BF thought it needed salt.

Signs of how authentic this place is? I went into the restroom and there was a sign written in Chinese with several exclamation points by the toilet. I have no idea what it said because I don't speak Chinese. But apparently they really wanted to convey some point.

BF was distressed that there were no fortune cookies. They gave us some kind of mints instead, which I have to say did taste like cough drops. Not my cuppa tea so to speak. But overall I thought this place was excellent."}
{"text":"This is a hard one for me. 

Growing up around many Asian cultures, I am familiar with and appreciate certain traditional Asian food, particularly Chinese. Being an Asian-American baby boomer, I also appreciate the palette of the millions of other American baby boomers seeking a more Americanized Chinese menu experience.  Zen Zen's menu leans towards the traditional Chinese and does not also capture the more traditional Americanized Chinese foods, thereby risking the dining dollars perhaps needed to support the restaurant and to give it the so important staying power.   Such is the Ying and Yang of this review.

I appreciated and enjoyed the traditional Chinese dishes I ordered - - steamed eggplant with stirfried spicy garlic and the Beijing special noddles. Yummy for my palate but I am not sure how consistently popular it may become for most diners seeking more Americanized Chinese fare. 

Indeed, there are many American diners who are more adventurous eaters of Asian foods.  Still, I believe they may be in the minority in our community. 

Also, I believe the layout, text and photos used in the menu may disorient and confuse diners and change their overall experience.  Much of it is in Chinese with limited English descriptions. Further, prices are on the high side which may put off some of the more old school American palettes looking for lunch specials and the more common items such as General Tso's chicken, Mongolian beef, cashew chicken, pepper steak, etc. at lower prices. Heck, I love those items, too!

If the restaurant's goal is to focus on traditional Chinese menu items, mission accomplished!  For those looking for a wider variety, heads up.

Signage for the restaurant on Watts Road is middling. The restaurant is attached to an Asian market whose sign and space captures most of the attention of the passing traffic. But for a recommendation or information, say on Yelp, it would be very easy to miss the restaurant altogether. Inside, the space is small and not that well lit.  Still, it is clean. Service is prompt and pleasant and perhaps that is only because there were two diners in the restaurant during the lunch hour.  Me and a Caucasian gentleman who seemed to be traveling on business.  If the restaurant is hoping that the local Asian community will support it, that was not apparent at lunch, unless you're considering by percentages. If so, it was 50-50! (This recent election year and the media coverage has taught me how to better spin numbers to influence perceptions). 

That is not to say the food was not good. It was. I'm just concerned that   with its menu items, the menu layout, and the restaurant's location and signage (small), they may be in for a long row to hoe. 

So in the assigning of Yelp stars, the results are as follows:
Quality of food and service: 4 stars. 
Extensiveness of menu to suit many tastes: 2.5 stars. 
Ease of finding location and signage: 2.5 stars.
Liquor license status: 1 star.
In summary: average of 2.5 stars rounding up to 3 because I think they are really trying.

I wish them the best and look forward to going again.  See you there."}
{"text":"Excellent food, some details missing... Well, the suburbs of Madison Wisconsin are not what I would expect to be a mecca for fine Asian cuisine. However, we were delighted by the diverse and flavorful food at this spot.  We tried the garlic shredded pork and the pot mushrooms. It's not \"pot of\" mushrooms, she corrected me, it's pot mushrooms.  Anyway, both dishes were nicely seasoned and quite spicy, even though we didn't ask for it. There were lots of little chunks of garlic and ginger and basil floating around; the sauce was sweet and pungent.  My only concern was the rice. It was gummy and not flavorful.  Asian food restaurants usually have reliably great rice (?). The other detail that was unfortunately missing, was the fortune cookie! Now I know that Fortune cookies are not an authentic Chinese thing, so it is worth over looking, but it is one of those fun little things at Chinese restaurants.. In summary, this is a top prospect for takeout, make your rice at home :-).  There is also an extensive grocery store on the back of the same property."}
{"text":"Checked out the dumplings at ZenZen Taste. Tasted all four flavors.  Good!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and authentic Chinese food!! Absolutely no taste of MSG. The environment is very clean and comfy. Service is top - the chef is really friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We spent a great deal of time touring the Asian grocery store and finding some great items including fresh quail eggs that I've looked for in Madison for years!!! It wasn't easy to find the restaurant we sought until we saw a hand written sign in English directing us.
BEST Chinese we've had in years!!! Fried rice, spicy pork and beef noodle bowl were ALL delicious. We would highly recommend."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place for authentic Chinese. It was amazing! We ordered way too much and the waitress was incredibly friendly and helped us pick dishes that we would like."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Zenzen Taste is a hole-in-the wall, unassuming restaurant attached to an Asian grocery store. Came here with a small group of 4 on a Tuesday night and we were the only customers. After a lot of deliberation, we ended up ordering the creamy tofu, a clear rice cake appetizer, mixed mushroom stirfry, shuizhouyu (spicy fish in chili oil) and a spicy Szechuan style seafood stir fry. Service was extremely quick and I was very impressed. 

Everything was excellently made and very authentic, fresh and tasty. My favorites were the clear rice cake and mushrooms (though for the price, I felt the portions of both of these dishes were small). The fish was tasty and hot, but I felt the type of fish they used personally was a little soft (still worth trying though!). The seafood dish was tasty and the portion was huge (though it was pricier), but overall it did not wow me (I probably wouldn't order it again). Overall, I was extremely satisfied with my meal and will definitely come  back. 

The only thing I mention is that if you're looking for cheap greasy and filling fast-food style Chinese food, this is not it. Everything runs on the spicy side and 4 of us comfortably finished 4 dishes and one appetizer. This is a good restaurant to bring a big group to and order family style."}
{"text":"I think I like this place for all the reasons that others have listed as ones to not like it. They don't have General Tso's? THAT'S AWESOME!! Why would we honestly need another chinese restaurant that serves that in this city. I'm so excited to have new things to try. And these dishes are actual authentic dishes they would serve in China. 

They have a eccentric menu with photos and weird fonts? THAT'S AWESOME TOO! People are going to need help since they don't serve the typical Chinese fast food fare. And they provide awesome photos! I liked being able to pick my food based on picture. It felt fun and like I was a kid again.

I drove up to this place on a Friday night, you're more likely to see the sign for the supermarket than the restaurant sign but the entrance is in the front. But that's cool too, eat something, feel inspired, go buy the ingredients for it next door!

We got the lotus root appetizer. This was spicy and crunchy. Nice way to put away some vegetables. The three cup chicken dish, this was mild in spice, the chicken was coated and a bit crunchy. It was very good and I think a good safe dish for someone trying out new Chinese dishes for the first time.

Then tried he beef pot soup/stew. The beef was very tender, there was a good bit of collagen which is normal in this type of cuisine but can throw others off. The flavor of the soup was quite herbal so may be strong for others. I think it was tasty but a bit more adventurous for the palate. 

Thank you ZenZen for being bold and putting out new dishes for Madison to try!"}
{"text":"Spectacular. Got the cold bamboo dish, house style tofu, and eggplant in garlic sauce. I've never been crazy about bamboo, but this cold dish made it my new favorite food. The other 2 are standard dishes on good menus, and these versions were damn fine. Plenty of authentic and less adventurous dishes on the menu, and every plate around my table looked yummy. Spice level on the dishes we got were mild: present but not overwhelming for my more sensitive dining companion. 
I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about in regards to portion size and cleanliness. Both were good on this Sunday afternoon. 

Probably my favorite place to eat in Madison right now. Next time...chili fish!!!"}
{"text":"The best \"shuizhuyu\" ever since it is oil based rather than water based. The other dishes are very authentic too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After a few more trips here since my initial review, I've got to bump this up to five stars.  Best Chinese food in Madison by a long shot.  No \"lunch menu\" at lunchtime.  No forks without asking. No Americanized Chinese food in sight. No holding back on the spices. Hair metal on the radio."}
{"text":"I don't understand the high ratings. I've been here multiple times and each time is more disappointing than the last. Peking pork was the initial attraction for me since it's near impossible to find a restaurant with the same dish that does it properly. What i got was overtly salted pork from the the wrong cut and improperly sliced. Also instead of having the pork on top a bed of thinly sliced scallions, a few pieces of thick scallions were thrown in the side. As for the sauce, just use the commercial jar of ??? if you don't know how to make it from scratch. I admire the ambition, but if you don't possess the proper preparation techniques, don't serve it on your menu. It was utterly disappointing. 

Otherwise, the assorted mushrooms were good. I continue to return for that. But nothing else. Most of their dishes take on a dark color. At first look i thought they use the dark soy sauce for deeper flavor, but upon tasting the dishes I realized it's probably reused oil. 

Lastly the portions are small. Oh and do not order their house fried rice. That's a scam. 

Piece of advice to the owners: Although the summer months may be slow and you're looking at your budgets, please don't skimp on your customers. It's a highly competitive business and your clients can easily take their businesses else where if they find better value in another restaurant. Or in the case of your Chinese clients, they could just cook at home."}
{"text":"at last, a Sichuan restaurant that is liberal with their use of sichuan peppercorn. Really overjoyed with their malaxiangguo as well as the pot sirloin with potato. They are both very savory. The numbing heat in the malaxiangguo was also perfect. This place really made my day! Will definitely come back to try more."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is labeled \"Asian Fusion\" because it is NOT. This place is fairly authentic for a chinese restaurant, so don't let the incorrect yelp label deter you from trying out this place. 

I've had my fair share of Asian food from the biggest cities in the US, and I'd say that this place is certainly comparable. I tried the garlic eggplant, the zenzen fried rice (which comes with bacon...I guess that's kinda fusion if you're into that), the pork dumplings, and one other dish that I'm not sure how to say in English but it's some sort of pork + leeks + tofu wrap. All of it was fairly delicious, with the garlic eggplant dish being a standout.

I'd definitely give this place a shot if you're looking for an authentic chinese restaurant in the area. It has a decently sized parking lot and the establishment is clean and looks pretty new."}
{"text":"It is without a doubt the best Chinese restaurant in Madison. Most of the dishes are very authentic, especially the Northern Chinese dishes. It is attached to the Asian market (J&P), so take a look inside while waiting for your dishes. The only downside is that they closes at 9pm."}
{"text":"Downgrading because they are randomly not open when they are supposed to be. One time we couldn't get through so we drove down and they were closed. We also try to order togo and no one answers or they answer and hang up? Food has also been way too oily. Probably will not be ordering from them again too inconstant."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a more authentic Chinese restaurant to go to in Madison. I think ZenZen satisfied that criteria for me. 

I have been here twice now - once for take out, once for dine in. They definitely give more food if you dine in. Also, I think this was an error on the server's end of things, but when we got take-out, we were charged an 18% gratuity?? The server seemed confused. We didn't realize until we looked at the receipt later that we were charged 18% more. Also, the receipt is in Chinese, so I don't actually know if it was gratuity.

I've gotten the Eggplant in Garlic Sauce both times. What makes it taste so great is that they stir-fry the eggplant first, which are cut in smaller thinner pieces, then stir-fry with peppers and onions, or at least that's what I think they do.

We got the braised pork belly stew yesterday. \"Hong shao rou\" is what it is in Chinese. The pork belly was more fat than meat, but still tasted good and flavorful. It was advertised to have century egg in it, though I may be misremembering. It came with regular hard boiled eggs, but it was pretty good in the stew.

The mapo tofu was VERY spicy and numbing the way it should be, unlike most Chinese restaurants. I dislike the numbing spice in general, but I thought the dish was very good in comparison to some of authentic mapo tofu dishes I've had in the past.

If you like hot and sour soup, get it here! I thought the $1.95 price tag was for a single serving, but no, it is a gigantic bowl. I'm pretty satisfied with that portion. We had to take it home because we didn't realize it was going to be a full meal.

The downside as many other reviews have mentioned is the only server on Friday nights. I felt sorry for her that she was the only server, but I think this is on management to make sure there are enough servers. I could tell she was very frustrated... She mentioned many times to other Chinese-speaking customers that she was the only server and it's hard for her to get everything done in a timely manner. (I understand Chinese but cannot speak it.) I could hear her yell back at the chefs who were ringing the bell for dishes, \"Wait a minute, I'll be right there!\" Kudos to her though. I felt like I was watching a real live version of Diner Dash."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and each time the food is excellent. The food is traditionally Mandarin. Service is good. Try the hot and sour soup!"}
{"text":"Delicious traditional Chinese style Chinese restaurant at Madison. Not that spicy and too much oil like other Chinese restaurant. Thought it is a little salty sometimes.
Besides the Friday night, the server offer the dishes very quickly. Friday night, you need wait a little longer time but it is ok for us. Go could order the food than do grocery at J&P fresh market, which is quite convenient. When you go back, the yummy food are severed at the table. 
You could try the Perking roasted duck by reservation. It is a little expensive but sharing it with friends is a good memory. Also sometimes if the roasted duck is cool, the servers are happy to re-heat it for us. 
The noodles and lamb dumplings are other two good choices. You should try them if you love noodles and dumplings!"}
{"text":"Very good beef tenderloin, steer clear of the spicy chicken. Overall good experience, and impressed with the atmosphere."}
