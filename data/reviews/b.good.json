{"text":"Ordered through ritual. Screwed up the order, burgers were dry and fries were burnt. Had to throw away a full order of fries. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Solid burger and smoothie, prices are a bit high but I guess you pay for being healthy?"}
{"text":"We are always looking for delicious and healthy lunch options that work for us as adults and our 2 small children. I don't know why we didn't try b.good sooner. Our kids were happy with their hot dogs, broccoli, and applesauce and my husband and I were happy with our bowls. The food was fresh and flavorful and resonantly priced for the quality. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is every hungry person's nightmare. First, the girl making my burger was so busy talking to her pal she forgot my order of fries. I had already waited 15 minutes at this point. When she finally handed me my bag something was telling me to check that everything was in there. When I pointed out that the fries (not cheap!) were missing, she nonchalantly brought them. \"Here you go\"!  When I got home I opened the kale bowl and the stinky dairy smell of the dressing slapped me right in the face. I threw the $12 bowl straight in the trash. Never again."}
{"text":"We had the chicken sandwich (west side) with fries and a kale crush smoothie and the local apple & bacon salad bowl.   While the chicken sandwich was a bit on the small side I have to admit it was very tasty and juicy.    The fries were good and I liked that the fat content is half of that of major fast food fries.   The salad bowl was also good although the bacon seemed a bit overcooked/chewy.   The smoothie was very good too.  Interesting selection of original drinks too.  Overall, We were pretty impressed with the food despite it being a bit on the pricey side ~$30 all-in."}
{"text":"I love the food and drinks but the reason I only gave 4 stars is that I have been 3 times, and every time there is a customer service issue.   1- ordered the curry grilled avocado bowl.  It was missing the avocado, but I only noticed after sitting down. So I got up and went back (hello... avocado is the reason I ordered this!). The cashier told me the avocado is in the salad. In fact, it's supposed to be on top. I went back to the order pick up area and he promptly gave me the avo (and told me they often forget this?)  2- If you order a smoothie, be prepared to wait until your entire order is ready. Also this runs the risk of someone else walking by and taking yours and thinking it is theirs. This has happened twice.  I don't know why they don't just call you when it's ready as last time I think my smoothie sat there for nearly ten minutes.  The next time I just walked up and told them I was taking my smoothie and they were ok with it!  3- I ordered a green smoothing with pineapple (like kale and pineapple). As soon as we tried it, something just didnt taste right, it was way to bitter for a smoothie.  When we asked they told us that they had run out of pineapple. I guess they hoped we wouldn't notice.  They did credit me for another smoothing next time, but I don't understand why they just didn't ask if they could substitute something?   I love the carrot cake smoothie (when they had it seasonally) and the spicy lime and avocado bowl! Their soups are pretty great too along with their regular potato fries!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying b.good but was rather disappointed.  Nice and friendly staff and the menu looked interesting.  Unfortunately our burgers were pretty dry and bland and the buns were not good at all."}
{"text":"Had the curry and grilled avocado bowl with a side of butternut squash soup, was not disappointed. The food is good, and I really appreciate the concept. They focus on sustainable, locally sourced ingredients. The restaurant is decorated with actual farmers who provide the quality ingredients. Looking forward to a second visit."}
{"text":"Got the Spicy Avocado and Lime with grilled chicken and quinoa. It was AMAZING. The kale was baked so it was really crunchy. Everything tasted amazing, really healthy and fresh. Took almost 20 minutes to get my order but it's because they make it fresh and cook the chicken properly."}
{"text":"This place has really good and healthy options! I think once you go inside and give it a chance, you are happily surprised on the freshness and localness of the food. Unfortunately, the marketing is off and they need a makeover really badly to get more walk-ins. Also, when I went, they ran out of avocado and posted a sign saying that they ran out of it (which made people feel like they needed it even more). Just not very good marketing for a great place."}
{"text":"I find that the service in this place has gone downhill since they opened. It is no longer enough to call ahead and expect the food to be ready in 15 minutes. When it is slow!! I think I'll be limiting my visits."}
{"text":"I went there not wanting anything special, just a simple bacon cheese burger, with fries and a drink. Total price, $16.70. Apparently bacon is $1.50 and cheese is $1.50 extra on top of the 7.99 cost of the burger. Ridiculous.  As for the food: The fries are good with delicious seasoning. The burger was average. Not near the best I've ever had but not near the worst. I wanted to get a smoothie but after already giving them an arm and a leg, I didn't want to give up any more limbs.   The place is clean with ample patio seating. The staff are nice. I just wish the menu had more options and wasn't over priced for essential things such as cheese and bacon. With burgers being the main dish on the menu, there really isn't much appeal for me to go there when there's a bunch of burger places near by which don't cost an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"We came across this restaurant after an evening walking tour. We didn't expect much from an unknown burger place but we were very pleasantly surprised by how good the food was.  I had the turkey burger with Guapo toppings and my husband had the burger with Guapo toppings with fries. A little pricey, but in line with Hero Burger or South Street Burger. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken and fries takes the ordinary to new levels. And try the milkshakes."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place when I read about it online. Unfortunately I had a pretty awful experience (which is very unlikely for me).   I went to this place with some colleagues during work and ordered the spicy avocado and lime bowl with the carrot cake smoothie. The food took way too long to prepare and by the time they finished they had actually still forgotten one order. Also, as I was watching them prepare my food, I noticed the cook pick up and examine 3 different sauces before dressing the bowl which clearly gave away he had no clue which one belonged with my order. Then when we finally got our food and brought it back to our office, my colleague found the biggest moth I had ever seen amongst his salad. Needless to say we all threw out our meals and went somewhere else.   Sorry - it is a great concept but there is some work to be done with the execution."}
{"text":"We just checked out a great new resto in the St Lawrence neighbourhood. Fast food that's imaginative, locally or Fair Trade-sourced and VERY delicious! We had the roasted butternut-cheese-almond-cranberry spinach salad, blue-cheese & buffalo sauce burger and a custom burger with cheese & bacon. We haven't yet tried the kale/quinoa bowls or any of the really interesting smoothies. So good! Nice and friendly! Glad it has arrived!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4-5 times so far. It is conveniently located next to my work-out place so is handy to pick up a salad after a hard work-out. Pros- variety and uniqueness of their salads. Love the southwest salad and sweet potatoe fries. Cons- bit pricey for counter service/take-out and sometimes takes a while even when ordered ahead of time on the app. Overall, love the salads so will keep coming back. I like that they source their food supply locally."}
{"text":"South Street Burger is WAY better, I had the Veggie Burger and sweet potato fries - IT TOOK WAY TOO LONG, very slow.    Veggie Burger under under cooked and they actually pressed the bun on top and it all squished out the sides - all MUSH.....nasty"}
{"text":"Real food, local ingredients! The burgers are delicious and lots of toppings to choose from. There are different salads and quinoa bowls as well. The beverages made my day here, 3 types of lemonade and I also tried the vanilla shake made from Greg's ice cream. Cozy environment with awesome staff, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome went in for a burger and fries and a drink all of the beverage selections were tasty and i'd never seen them before. Fries were amazing burger was alright, since it's a healthier place maybe another option would be tastier."}
{"text":"We had two turkey burgers: the Cousin Oliver and the West Side. The meat was tasty, the burgers were a good size and the ingredients tasted fresh and healthy. As a side we ordered the Crisp Veggies and the Grilled Local Corn. The Crisp Veggies were $5.99 and consisted of steamed broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and kale. They weren't crisp or seasoned at all - what a waste of money. The only thing that made up for the veggies was the Grilled Corn. It was absolutely delicious - sweet, cheesy, and flavourful. If I go back to B.Good the only thing I'll be ordering is the Grilled Corn."}
{"text":"A great healthy option in the St. Lawrence Market 'hood. This is now my go-to stop when I don't want to/don't have time to cook as I get a good meal without the guilt. My faves are the Spicy Avocado & Lime bowl (with or without chicken) or the burger Joanie style. Definitely worth signing up to their \"family\" as you get free stuff and being able to scan the app to track your visits or redeem gifts, keeps it simple!"}
{"text":"Fabulous healthy food and outstanding service! Will wait a little longer and pay more than fast food but worth the wait and price, as everything is fresh! My favorite is the southwest salad! Beef burgers are delicious. French fries are very flavorful as is the ketchup. The kids meals are big for my four year old. His fav is the grilled cheese. The homemade apple sauce that comes with the kids meals is so good I wish it was a side dish for adults!"}
{"text":"Diverse menu (soups, beef, turkey and vegie burgers,  kale &  grain bowls,  salads,  smoothies and shakes) good portions,  great taste... Reasonable prices... Dressings,  catchup and drinks are really good too beet ginger lemonade"}
{"text":"I definitely love this place: healthy, tasty, not expensive and they are pretty fast serving your meals.  I usually come here after work at night time and the atmosphere at that time is pretty relaxing, I know that around lunch time they are pretty packed, everybody that went there always recommended it.  My favourite is the beef burger on whole wheat, called West Side with no-salsa (sorry guys but I personally try to not eat onions), I get the fries (they give you lots of them, so if you are in two you can share 1 portion) and my favourite drink is the beet one.  The people working there are pretty friendly, young and dynamic. They always one and check if you are doing alright.  What I like is that every ingredients are actually all from Ontario and they don't use gmo ingridients.  You should definitely check this place out, it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"About time for clean fast food. Everything is healthy, delicious, and refreshing. The kicker for me was that everything is locally sourced and the sweet potatoes are baked in the oven without anything you wouldn't add in your own kitchen if you were a clean eater. I think that applies to everything on their menu, actually. A+"}
{"text":"Healthy food yummy salads,okay burgers,yummy fries and the best drinks!  this is a perfect place to a perfect lunch"}
{"text":"Amazing concept, good flavour and clean space impresses, while the portion of our soup was rather small for 5$.  We were disappointed that our eat-in soup and veg came in disposable \"take-away\" packaging. Doesn't really support the concept."}
{"text":"The veggie burger tasted like mush and the watermelon and feta salad was not very fresh"}
{"text":"Went after reading all these reviews. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. Prices are outrageous. I ordered their avocado lime bowl and added the chicken for a total price of $16 . The bowl was not even full and had tonnes of kale but hardly any traces of quinoa. There were literally 5 strips of chicken in there. The dressings did not taste good at all infact pretty awful. For the price I paid ( yes I know they use locally grown produce ) but i would expect shall decent tasty meal at least."}
{"text":"Ordered the Turkey burger to-go and had to pay extra for cheese and a Gluten Free bun so it put me back $13 (no sides included). The burger was super bland and tasted like a leftover reheated patty. I had to put my own toppings on once I got home to actually give it flavour.   Would not go back to this place ever again."}
{"text":"We live in this area so it was just a matter of time before we tried this place out.  We were told ahead of time that the food takes time, so we were mentally prepared for that but the kiddos were hungry... This resulted in some pretty anxious looks from me to the kitchen.  Finally just as my lo started bawling the food was called out to us.    We ordered a watermelon feta salad, a burger and fries, and 2 kids meals,  1 drink and 1 milkshake came to $50.09. So this isnt necessarily cheap, but on par I'd say to Chipotle.    The food was good, my salad was really impressive.  Lots of fruit and cheese, a variety of ingredients and very fresh.  The burgers were good too, but a bit on the small side.  Fries were very tasty.  Rosemary lemonade was so good I was hoping it was free refills.  But sadly no.    So next time I'll order ahead and then pick up to avoid the wait time.  Looking forward to trying their bowls next time."}
{"text":"I've been there couple times because it's close to my work. It's funny how there's around 6-8 people working there and they mess up orders when there's only a few customers. The portion also varies time to time. I also think that they are over-priced especially the burgers.   I got an e-mail saying that I have a free shake/smoothie. I went there and was told that it no longer apply to you because you installed the new app. However, I got the e-mail after I updated the app. I was pissed so they gave it to me at the end. However, that's not professional."}
{"text":"Great shakes.  Will have to try the bowls next time or the burgers.  They both look amazing."}
{"text":"My second visit here was a little disappointing.  I was happy with the customer service provided by the friendly and welcoming cashier, but on this visit my order took a little longer than expected (nearly 20 minutes).  A group of people who ordered after me managed to get their orders before me made me think was my order complicated and hence took longer.  Then, I wondered if they had screwed up my order and had to remake it or worse did they forget about my order all together.  Thankfully, I had their delicious and healthy beet-ginger lemonade to keep me happy as I was people watching while I waited for my order.  The beet and ginger was a nice mixture, plus both are good for the body and full of healthy benefits.  FYI, beets are good for lowering blood pressure, boosting stamina, fighting inflammations, has anti-cancer properties, rich in valuable nutrients and fiber, plus supports detoxification.  Whereas, ginger helps with digestive issues, nausea, pain reduction and inflammation.  I was happy when I finally heard my name called and off to the patio I went with my food.  My disappointment came with the burger, the beef patty, although tasty and flavourful, it was unproportionate to the bun as the bun just seemed oversized.  I ordered the West Side burger which came with avocado, cilantro, fresh salsa, chipotle puree and lime.  The flavours all blended nicely and had a good kick to it, but it was definitely too watery as it was dripping from my burger and made the bun a little soggy.  Who's a fan of a soggy bun? Definitely not me!  Plus the oven baked fries still could use a bit more baking as it wasn't crisp at all. I know it won't be as crispy as fries in the fryer, but it was a bit of a soggy mess. And I know this can happen at times, but I managed to get a few sweet potato fries with my regular fries. Are they not cooked separately? What if someone had an allergy?  I'm apprehensive if I'll come back to this location, but may try the new Queen location when it opens since it's closer to home."}
{"text":"Kale kale kale! I felt like everything on the menu had kale which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Kale crush smoothie is a definite must try. The pineapple juice in it is just sublime. A bit of coconut might have been good too. The spicy avocado bowl was absolutely delicious and the sauce is to die for. Very filling too despite its size. Root beer is amazing and not too sweet. Chili took some getting used to as there was no meat but tasty nonetheless. Minestrone was hearty as well. A friend commented it was nice to be able to identify all the ingredients.  Service was quick and friendly. I want to try their burgers next time I'm back. Prices were a bit steep but understandable given the clientele in that part of Oakville."}
{"text":"Love the convenience of the app for ordering. And the free sides they seem to always be happy to give away! The bowls and salads are yummy and filling. Staff are friendly. Meals can sometimes take a little bit of time to prepare, but I don't mind because I know they're making it fresh.   I also love that they source locally as much as possible. Its nice knowing that they put so much care and thought into feeding us."}
{"text":"ok I know it is a healthier restaurant but I LOVE their fries so far have had a burger fries and soup on different stops and it is ALL good and the staff are very nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Veggies with chicken, acai smoothie w sweet potato fries. Everything, but the fries I would order again. Fries were good, but not worth the calories."}
{"text":"B. Good is a safe choice for healthy greens + protein. The burgers are good, but the grain bowls are the real winners."}
{"text":"Nice people but we both ordered meals with avocado and they had so many black spots on them. We sent the food back and got more overripe black avocado. Quality doesn't seem great anymore... A place like this should have really fresh food"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for lunch! It is real food -- fast! Their CURRY & GRILLED AVOCADO bowl was delicious, healthy and filling. I highly recommend it and I can't wait until my next visit!"}
{"text":"My workplace ordered from here on a regular basis. Takeout at lunchtime, typically for 6-12 people.   Food is great (5 stars), but the customer experience needs serious improvement (2 stars at best).  We send someone over from our office to pick up lunch and it must be over 5 times now that they have sent us out the door without all of our order. Our employee will often stand there for 10 mins after the scheduled pickup time and then finally when the food arrives they will say that's everything, get him to pay and send him on his way.   Whenever items are missing and we call to inquire they always say it's our fault and that the food was ready when we were there picking it up. It's really quite a bad customer experience because we will have people in a lunch meeting and half the people will be eating or people will be politely waiting, only to eventually eat a cold lunch.   We order lunch from local restaurants every day and never have this problem with any other restaurant.   Hope this criticism is constructive as we really do enjoy the food and like having healthy/fast food options for work groups, but having hiccups like that happen on a regular basis and having our office assistants and office managers yelled at regularly but the B Good staff is very inappropriate.   They overall seem very unorganized and have poor communication with their fellow coworkers.   Unless there is significant improvement I cannot see us ordering from there again anytime soon. And for a company that orders lunch everyday for between 6-12 people I would think they would want to keep our business."}
{"text":"This place is my second home. The Southwest Chicken salad is da bomb. Includes a well-marinated/seasoned grilled chicken, avocado, and the toasted and grilled corn add a nice crunchiness. Highly recommended.  I've also had the roasted Brussels sprouts and it was pretty good. DID YOU KNOW Brussels sprouts is spelled with \"S\" at the end of Brussels? NOT \"Brussel sprouts\". Just like \"Swiss Chalet\" - it is NOT \"SWISHALET\". They are two separate words. Give them the respect they need.   Anyway, back to b.good. They take their time to make their food but so worth the wait. Probably around 5-10 minutes (15-20 min at peak hours) from the time you order, so don't come here if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Update: I've been back several times since the last post and have been really disappointed. Served a burger with raw meat stuck to the outside, given an incorrect order, and overall having dry chicken breast every time.   Old post: I live in the area and I've been watching this place under renovation for what seemed like forever. The food is good (I had the quinoa kale bowl with almond, ginger and other veg). It was a bit pricey though, I added grilled chicken to my bowl and got a combo (drink and baked sweet potato fries), came out to $20. But, I'm willing to pay more for local fresh REAL food.  The staff are really friendly and they have free WiFi (which is the reason I came in! The local coffee shop was full). It was bright and sunny and a great place to enjoy a fresh and delicious meal.   I'm so happy that we this choice in the area. I hope it does well =)"}
{"text":"This is my favourite spot to eat! I love their food options and service! I have never tried the combinations of food they are offering before and I have to tell you, they are quite delicious! Everything is healthy, fresh and Canadian, ahah I love you, guys! Keet it up!"}
{"text":"For a carnivore like myself, b.good is thankfully more than just a salad bar.  Though if salads and vegan-friendly fare is your fancy, they've got those available too, along with fruit and veggie smoothies.   Serving entirely local, organic items b.good has this ideal down pat.  There's a chalkboard displayed prominently on the wall as soon as you enter, pinpointing where the day's ingredients have been sourced.  Even the ketchup dispensers pump out organic, preservative-free ketchup advertising that it contains 50% less sugar than the usual, grocery store stuff (though this one tastes and has the consistency closer to tomato paste than ketchup).  Next to the ketchup is also a self-serve soda stand with craft-brewed, organic sodas and a couple of fruity drinks like raspberry lemonade and rosemary lemonade.   On the day I went, they had a promotion offering a free smoothie plus a side of baked fries for anyone who's downloaded/registered their app.  I think the smoothie promo is over now, but the fries one probably still stands. The cash staff was really friendly and patiently waited for my app to finish loading.  I had the Sal-Bacado, a burger (beef, my choice) with salsa, avocado with an egg (at additional cost) on top.  The thick pattied burger tasted better than I had expected!  The oven-finished fries weren't my favourite, but were okay - soft on the inside, but I miss the crispy-thin shell of traditionally fried fries.  They also tasted less salty, which was nice, but I think could've used a smattering of herbs (rosemary, maybe?) to fill the absence of extra salt.   My strawberry banana smoothie was rather sour, as if the bananas weren't fully ripe yet, so I would probably skip it next time.  For the rest of it though, pretty yums!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California, we spotted B.good and I'm glad we did.  We ordered a Turkey Cousin Oluvef combo with a Three Greens and Real Fries.  The Turkey Patty was well seasoned, and juicy. It had the right amount of bite to it and was filling at 4oz. We split it, so even at 2oz I felt it was satisfying. Those pickles, oh man. Subtle and tasty, but not overpowering. It paired well, though I would say for being homemade it didn't have any type of added complicity to push the burger in any way - it was just: there.  The Real Fries were very good, crispy golden brown, well seasoned and it had plenty of fluffiness. We paired it with the homemade chili sauce and homemade ketchup. Both were delicious.  We really enjoyed the ambiance and the crowd here seemed well placed.  Pricing was what was expected though I'd say it's a little bit pricier.  Three Green wasn't any special, but it did taste good. Definitely, encourage this place to folks wanting something filling, yet healthy at a decent price.  Major thing that's needed: Yelp check-in coupons. Everywhere is doing it, might as well hop on :p  Definitely will come back here during our visit."}
{"text":"Since my last visit, I received a free kale salad and I loved it.  Great marketing promotions; You turned my 3 star review to 5.  And no hair in my food! Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite healthy places in Toronto. I always go for Southwestern chicken salad. Fresh ingredients and very yummy.  As I am reading other reviews I noticed I have to try their burgers. I will soon.  Friendly and enthusiastic staff."}
{"text":"I've had their burger- it's pretty good as far as burgers go, but it's not really something to write home about.  BUT - I am absolutely in love with their harvest kale salad. It might be one of the most delicious salads I have ever eaten and I have gone back for it about five times now in the past three months since I've first had it. Try it. I dare you. I am not wrong."}
{"text":"Sorry, always feels bad giving a poor review.  I really wanted to like this place because of it's concept of fresh/healthy & local food sources. The other thing I will say is that the two times I've visited, the staff were friendly and helpful.   Now, the food. First time I had the Turkey Burger dressed as \"Cousin Oliver\" which the cashier explained was like their take on a Big Mac. It wasn't bad but underwhelming, especially for the price.   Even based on that experience, I decided to give b.good another chance. Today, I ordered the Veggie Burger dressed West Side with a whole wheat bun. It was just terrible. The bun itself was dense, dry, and rather flavourless. The worst part was the veggie patty. Just an incredibly mushy and unseasoned mixture of grain and bean. The texture was just so off-putting - mush, mush, mush.  Maybe the other menu items are better, but based on that last veggie burger experience I simply can't bring myself to come back."}
{"text":"Somehow our order keeps getting screwed up. The first time we ordered off ritual we got a burger with no toppings. Just today I walked in for pick up and got a burger with the wrong toppings. For the price I'm paying for this tiny burger I really expect my order to be correct more times than not. The only reason why it's not a one star rating was because the food was still yummy.  Get your act together!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and staff were friendly. I went in the intention of trying the vegan burger but unfortunately they ran out. Lucky they offered to make a any of the salads and sandwiches vegan where possible. I had the spicy avocado & lime  salad substituting the feta for more avocado, with a grain medley (brown rice, lentils) instead of the bean and corn salsa. My sister had the same salad with chicken.   The food tasted fresh and was filling but light at the same time."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best salads I've ever had. Power bowl is definitely a favourite. What I love is the standard of quality; never disappointed with quality, taste, or service."}
{"text":"The salads are doused in dressing and the chicken is over cooked, dry and horrible tasting."}
{"text":"I can't stop going back to b.good.   Since I live and work in the Financial District, this restaurant (just east of Yonge and King) is the perfect place to dine in comfortably or do take-out.   The turkey burger here is a must try, and the Southwestern Chicken salad is a big plate that has high quality and fresh ingredients (the chicken is actually REAL chicken, unlike Subway or similar fast food restaurants).   Some may say it's overpriced, but I personally think that this is a restaurant with fair pricing. Given that the area is full of mediocre options or overpriced restaurant pricing, b.good is a blessing in the Yonge and King area for health conscious foodies."}
{"text":"Great food. You can really taste the difference in the local quality of the food this establishment provides. Good sizes portion. Nice sit down. Took a little too long to get our  food. Place was not busy . 15 min for burger 20 min for fries ."}
{"text":"Tried this place on their opening day and never went back.  I'm happy that there is a healthy food joint in the neighbourhood, but for the price and all the hype I wasn't wowed. I tried their grilled chicken burger, and it was just okay."}
{"text":"Great food and all fresh from farm to restaurant with a list of where it's all from that day. Menu is diverse and has something for everyone, food is made fresh at time of order. This is not a fast food place so it takes a few minutes to prepare your order. Give it a shot it never disappoints and fits all diets."}
{"text":"I work in the area and I've been trying to find healthy lunch options. I really like this place because the customer service is great, the store clerks are very friendly, and the food is quite good. The downside is that it's quite pricey for everyday lunch (ends up being around 15 after tax) and the portions are not very big for the price, so I'm still trying to find other options."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and was amazed by some really good healthy options. The staff are friendly and the portion size is just right. The place definitely got busy during lunch and i had to wait for some time for my food. All in all.. definitely a good place for lunch."}
{"text":"With all the lunch competition out there - you can do much, much better. I've had a few things from here now and I've found it to be wayyyyy overpriced. My experience in point form:  -burnt, yet soggy sweet potato fries -lots of raw carrot in the bowls, tiniest portion bland quinoa.  -'meh' sauces on the bowls - this is the only source of flavour too. -watched a smoothie take 10mins to prepare  Kupfert & Kim does it much better AND a little cheaper. The difference is in cooking and preppin' the ingredients with creativity and having well balanced flavours. Ya can't just rely on the dressing.   I like the concept, but I ain't coming back."}
{"text":"3rd visit. Really good fast food with healthy options. Feels good to eat local and consider that maybe we are supporting our Ont farmers . The service is rather pitiful - and for that reason, I don't think they are going to make it. Service is important in this part of town, so get there quick, enjoy a quick meal supporting local farmers, before it's gone!"}
{"text":"What can you say about a business that tries their best to be local and good for you. How about the food is delicious. The chicken bowls are filled with love. The Acai Berry smoothie was delicious.  I haven't tried the burgers but that is next on my list."}
{"text":"I've been walking past this place for a little while and finally found the time to pop in. I was really drawn in by their \"buy local\" and fresh made, ground in store burgers and really interesting and tasty sounding salads. B.Good seemed to be offering fast food that was fresh and locally sourced. I was expecting an owner run shop, but this place is run like a franchise without any ownership present. Which wasn't a problem by any means, it was merely an impression I received from looking at it from the outside, as they have the owners name on the front door. The staff did a decent job, but like any franchise run store, the employees don't seem to care all that much.   All of that aside, the food was ok, I had the COUSIN OLIVER burger which was to have fresh veggies including home made pickles!  I also had their fresh fries and a chocolate milkshake which they boasted had the best handmade ice cream ever in it. Well The burger was just ok, the patty was actually smaller than the bun lol, I also found it very crumbly, super dry to the taste and hard to keep together, partly because they used 2 super thick slices of tomato which were very mushy and not fresh at all. Sadly they also forgot the homemade pickles! which was VERY disappointing... as it was a big reason i ordered it. There was nothing I could do as I was home already and definitely was not going back just for pickles lol.   Over all the burger had potential but was assembled quite poorly and again quite dry and overcooked, it was also smaller than the average home made burger by far. The milkshake was also just average, the ice cream was honestly nothing special, or not nearly as special as they advertised, in my opinion for $5.99 it should have blown me away... I've definitely had MUCH better.   What was as advertised though was the fries, they were delicious. in conclusion, my experience at B.Good could have been much better, but it was far from lousy, I will definitely give this place another try and next time I will be more diligent and inspect my order thoroughly before leaving, I will also give one of their pretty tasty looking, but very highly priced salads a try as well.   Finally, Be prepared to shell out more Shekel's or Drachma's for this food, as this place not cheap by any means. I'll update this after my next visit,  here's hoping it's a better experience!"}
{"text":"My first time trying food at this place and it was pretty good! I had the veggie burger made as west side that includes avacado, cilantro, and chipotle. It tasted really good. I had it as a combo with regular fries. I really loved their fries because it was low in salt and tasted fresh. My order came up a little pricey ($15) but I think it was worth it.   Also the service was great! The people were really nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was awesome. I got some studying done."}
{"text":"Very fresh with high quality and interesting menu. We found it accidentally and we will be back intentionally. Well done guys. Keep being great and special."}
{"text":"Love this place! I seem to forget to come here - no idea why, maybe it's the weird name? - but the four times I've been I've had great food that makes me feel super amazing (unless I get decadent fries, then I only feel mostly amazing...) I really appreciate all the healthy and vegetarian options, and that they use local farm ingredients as much as possible, which are always listed on the board. And today's cashier was hilarious! Walking in today made my day."}
{"text":"Ordered take out here a couple times and it's always good. Filling but doesn't make you feel bloated. I always get the Turkey burger and it's very juicy. I decided to dine in today and got the Caesar salad. The chicken was very moist. The service is great and the facility is very clean. A little bit of a wait for the food but that's cus they make everything fresh."}
{"text":"Maybe b.good should have been striving for \"b.great\". Had the burger \"West Side\" style which allegedly was to include avocado, cilantro, fresh salsa, chipotle puree, lime. I'm not even sure which toppings actually showed up to the party. It was less of a party, more of a small social gathering in which everyone stood awkwardly off to the sides of the room, sipping their drink and looking dolefully at the clock every few minutes.   Also the bun to meat ratio was disturbingly off. Don't get me wrong - this thing was edible, just not really enjoyable. I will not b.going back."}
{"text":"They can't all be Shake Shack. Locally sourced ingredients are great. Lean beef is healthier, but if you are going to use it in a patty, you gotta use seasoning, otherwise it's flavourless like this is. I give it 1 year"}
{"text":"Totally sub-par butternut squash salad served in a filthy environment. b.good on queen really needs to step its game up. The salad leaves were unwashed;  you could literally taste the earth. The dressing was not mixed in. The three almonds were measly. Avoid."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to b good. I really wish Oakville had more healthy eateries like this!   I went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was quiet, only one other couple in the restaurant.   I ordered the Buffalo burger with fries. The wait was a little longer than anticipated since I was the only ones to place an order. The staff were very friendly though, so it didn't have an impact on my overall review. I'm willing to wait for good food! The burger was smaller than I expected, but really tasty! I loved the Buffalo sauce and the celery slaw. The fries are great too. They are cooked perfectly. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. The ketchup threw me for a loop though. It literally tastes like tomato paste from a fan. Low sugar apparently. No thanks! Quickly located the real deal and all was well in the world again.   I felt it was a little pricey for the portion size which has deterred me from going back. Overall I would go back if it was based on taste alone."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy avocado lime bowl with super grains. I really enjoyed it, however I did not see any avocado in it at all. This was disappointing because I didn't notice there wasn't any until I got home and it's my favourite food. I would probably get the spicy dressing on the side next time so I could save the leftovers for later.   The place itself is really clean. I can't wait to try more items they offer."}
{"text":"I love this place. Heard about b.good from a co-worker. So glad we decided to eat lunch here.  I ordered the Goomba beef burger with fries and a drink. The burger toppings included marinated arugula, wild mushrooms, and smoked gouda. They all complemented each other nicely. The beef patty was delicious, and the meat was juicy. The bun was nice and soft. They even have a gluten free bun option.  I love their fries, they have this spice mixture on them that just makes them divine. The fries have less fat and are healthier than fries you would get from other fast food places. What also makes them different is that they are finished off in the oven. The place even has their own all natural ketchup!  I love their home made lemonade. The beet and the rosemary lemonades are really good. I'd recommend giving them a try. It's not overtly tart and I liked that the beet lemonade, had that beet taste but it wasn't over powering.   Great friendly staff and bonus if you sign up for their rewards you get free fries on your next visit. The staff screwed up my order, but were quick to fix the mistake and we got free fries on our next visit!   What really great about this place is that things are locally sourced, and you can feel good about the food that you are eating.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I know the general manager personally so I had him make me something on the secret menu. Unfortunately he said not to say what was on it. Great environment to just hangout and awesome customer service. Variety of healthy and not so healthy option."}
{"text":"Very rude cashier! His name is \"D\". He treated us really bad. On top of that, he overcharged us. We realized it after eating. So we talked to another cashier and she refunded us the money that we were overcharged but she didn't apologized or say anything at all.  All the staff look like they hate their jobs. It's a shame because the food was good. It was not to die for, but it was good.  I had the Mediterranean bowl with the acai smoothie.  I would consider going back if I knew that the staff changed their attitude."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here on one of the nights that we were in Toronto because there was a flyer in our hotel lobby (Holiday Inn Express Toronto Downtown) and it was close to our hotel.  It was pretty good.  I had the Adopted Luke turkey burger with fries and the Three Greens smoothie, while my husband had the El Guapo turkey burger with sweet potato fries and a fountain soda.  The prices in the store were slightly higher than the prices on the flyer, so I think the flyer is dated (or they just raised their prices).  It's pricey for burgers and fries.  The burgers are around $8.  If you want a combo with fries/sweet potato fries and a fountain drink it's about $5 more.  If you want a combo with fries/sweet potato fries and a smoothie it's about $8 more.    The Adopted Luke burger came with mushrooms, caramelized onions, smoked gouda and BBQ sauce.  The toppings themselves and the burger were tasty, but the bun overpowered the burger somewhat.  I felt like it was too much bun, not enough other stuff.      I had a taste of my husband's burger.  It was bacon, jalapeno-ranch sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion and sauteed jalapenos.  It was too spicy for my liking and it suffered from the same bun to burger ratio issue.    The fries were excellent though.  Quite possibly the best fries I've ever had.  They weren't too oily/greasy.  They are hand cut and \"oven finished\" (as per the menu).  I don't know if they are entirely oven baked though, I question whether or not they are fried at some point.  Anyway, they were piping hot, super crispy and so delicious.  Both the regular fries and sweet potato fries were real winners.    I liked my Three Greens smoothie which contained spinach, mint, lime, pineapple, almond milk, honey and hemp seeds.  It wasn't too sweet and was blended smoothly.  I didn't taste any hemp seeds though (so either their blender is so powerful that it pulverized the hemp seeds, or maybe they forgot to put any in).  The fountain sodas are from Maine Root, which uses fair trade certified organic sugar in their sodas.  I really like how most of their ingredients are local and it's cute how they have little signs on the tables with information about the farmers that supplied their ingredients that day.       I would definitely come back for their fries.  Maybe I'll try their salads or quinoa bowls next time."}
{"text":"Yummy, friendly, fresh.  Great açai smoothie, delicious veggie burger, but I made the mistake of getting the sweet potato fries to go and they just didn't travel well.  soggy mess. next time i'll eat them fresh and on the spot. great service team working."}
{"text":"First time at B.Good, stumbled upon the Oakville location and ordered a seasonal salad, the Southwestern chicken salad: mesclun, avocado, grilled corn, tomatoes, black beans, toasted corn, Chipotle puree and balsamic vinaigrette. Loved this salad, was filling but didn't feel completely bloated after eating this. Really great texture, chicken was done well, felt moist, refreshing and not dry or bland. The balsamic vinaigrette was a surprising thick, creamy consistency and loved the crunch of the toasted corn mixed together in this.   I also ordered the Lucy Blue smoothie: blueberries, almond butter, dates, almond milk, lemon, cinnamon with my meal. Thought this smoothie was really rich, thick and had more of a filling dessert feel. It's not such a refreshing and light taste mainly because of the almond butter I'm guessing. Tasted like a blueberry muffin, if you're a sweet tooth you might go for this! Though personally, felt if I were to come back again and had a craving for the smoothie, I would just grab this without the meal because it felt so filling.   Overall, had a good experience at this particular B.Good location, have only tried a couple other similar places within the GTA such as The Cold Pressery, Cultures and Freshii - but would consider coming back (when I'm not on a college student budget)   There aren't any cheap options on the menu, though if you're going here it should be more so for the fact that they buy their produce and ingredients locally and everything is freshly made which maybe explains the cost.   As for wait times for food, a bit longer than average but overall presentation and delivery of our meal was great."}
{"text":"Every ingrediants here you have, are grown locally and this is what I found it uniquely healthy choice of restaurants in downtown Toronto. I came in on a Friday early evening.  It is not busy. The first impression is spacious and clean. Full staffed.  The staff who took my order and also offered if I need to add side or cheese.   Ok.. here is what I got. It is called Power Bowl . Power bowl comes with quinoa or multi mix grain I choose quinoa~  The wait time is shot and fast.  My order is ready shortly after I cleaned my hand. Food has good representation and tasted fresh~ more importantly. The egg is just medium cooked. Nice and warm to mix with quinoa.   Kale chopped small enough and well mixed with quinoa.   Some drinks are self served, free water is available for customers. It is a healthy fast food chained store. I like the fast food idea with lots of healthy dishes served. It runs fast and healthy food....great idea huh.  That's why I guess It is called b good.  Tip is not required. Pay first and wait to be called Yes they asked your name and be good to be called lol..I find it a little personal touch when get my name called to pick up my tray.    I basically really like the fast food idea which promote healthy eating. When you hear fast food, you think automatically of McDonald's or KFC. This is an outstanding fast food chained store which serve vegan or gluten free or vegetarian dishes or meat such as grills chicken and use mainly local ingredients.  It supports our local farms and promotes healthy eating.  Win win idea   One star lost because the drink fountain can be cleaned more often and I hope they can wipe the table and drink refill area more often so it maintain a better clean image of the store.  Two star also lost because the menu are too far and small for customers like me who don't have see far really well @@  It costs ~15 for one meal and could be shared.  My bowl was quite filling and I didn't buy drink.  Water was great and free.  Next time I would try their veggie burger :) bon appetite Toronto ;)"}
{"text":"I like what this place is about (the 'real food, feel good' concept for fast food, and being conscious of where your ingredients come from).  I tried the veggie burger el guapo style (bacon, jalapeno slaw, jalapeno ranch). I know. Sometimes I make strange choices like putting bacon on a veggie burger. Anyways! I found the burger lacked flavour. It was better after I put a layer of sriracha. I did feel good after eating it though, and not bloated or heavy.   For the price (close to $10), I found the portion to be quite small. And taste-wise, my veggie burger was decent but I don't know if I would order it again. Maybe worth a shot if you're in the area looking for a healthy fast food option."}
{"text":"What a great spot for a healthy or not so healthy bite to eat depending on your mood.  Great for couples where one wants healthy and the other wants a burger and fries.  Ordered the burger, fries, and the curry grilled avocado bowl.  The food is freshly made and they source local where possible and its written on the boards where that's the case.  The food was all good (nice fries!).  My only complaint is that the curry bowl came with your choice of quinoa or mixed grains.  The mixed grains had a specific grain that was far too hard to eat and could break a tooth if you're not careful as I spent time removing those kernels as my teeth chomped down on them.  Nice bright open space with metal chairs and wood tables.  You order at cash, they call you to get your order and then you bus your own table.  For some reason another couple had their meals brought out to them so some people get special treatment apparently."}
{"text":"Interesting to say the least...very SoCal! Need to try it more than once for a genuine assessment of the food. Kale seems to be thing here which is OK in moderation. Not inexpensive and the service on the slow side. I found the 'on the wall' menu somewhat complex and difficult to read. Pleasant young staff and some quite healthy looking customers! Nice to see Ontario based farm products the theme. Saw it featured on local Cable TV otherwise from the exterior have always assumed it was a fast food hamburger/pizza cafe which it isn't."}
{"text":"The Beet-Ginger Lemonade was only a bit sweet and the ginger taste was very strong.   It was made with water, lemon juice, beets, ginger, pure cane sugar, and orange peel.  I liked it.  The Roasted Butternut Seasonal Salad consisted of baby spinach, butternut squash, sharp cheddar, apples, almonds, dried cranberries, and a maple-mustard vinaigrette.  This was a very clean and raw salad.  The maple-mustard vinaigrette tied everything together although it would have tasted a little too raw and dry.  Even though this salad had cheese in it, since the cheese was locally sourced, it didn't taste heavy at all.  The Mediterranean Chicken Kale & Grain Bowl included romaine, grilled chicken, tomato, cucumber, green beans, radishes, feta, red pepper hummus, mint, sunflower seeds, and a za'atar vinaigrette.  The pieces of grilled chicken were pretty good; not too dry or rough in texture.  (If the chicken was even more moist or juicy though, it would have been even better.)  My favourite part of this bowl were the red pepper hummus (which was presented in a string squeezed all around the circumference of the salad) -- which I wish I had more of -- and also the quiona.  The quinoa was so soft and delicious!  I wish there were more of this in the bowl too.  The green beans were very fiberous and tasted like they had just been plucked out of the field.  The Roasted Brussel Sprouts included cheddar, almonds, balsamic glaze, and maple syrup. It was served in a paper take-out box.  The brussel sprouts were fibrous and very raw tasting so you have to make sure you chew everything thoroughly before chewing.  I say this in a good way because it meant that the brussel sprouts were fresh and they didn't cook it too much -- the nutrients would have more staying power.  I liked the slight sweetness of the maple syrup too.  The El Guapo Burger had bacon, homemade jalapeno slaw, and jalapeno ranch.  This was my favourite item out of the five.  The burger overall was on the small side though but it packed so much flavour!  The burger patty itself definitely tasted natural and fresh.  It was soft and tender.  The homemade jalapeno slaw and bacon and jalapeno ranch's heat and slight spiciness made it all taste so good.  There were slices of jalapeno so fresh that it was really crunchy."}
{"text":"I ordered burger and sweet potato fries only just to be clear. It seems salad is their specialty.   So I ordered El Guapo beef burger for $7.49 and sweet potato fries for $3.99 for a good total of $11.48 BEFORE TAX.   My expectation is that it will be tasty and healthy. The restaurant really looks ambient and clean as well. I had to wait a good 15 minutes so my expectation even went up higher.   I know the food is clean and free from antibiotics and hormones, but that's where the good part stops. The portion is a tad smaller although that's what you get for 'healthy' food. But the taste is really really average. Borderline bland for burger. Bacon is surprisingly tasteless and cheese is.. did I feel the cheese? The sweet potato helped a bit but the portion is small for $3.99.  In conclusion the burger is just OK (or maybe not ok) but the money is better spent somewhere else. Healthy part doesn't help either. I don't know a good burger place yet in Toronto but definitely this is not one of them."}
{"text":"I went here when it first opened and got a salad and a chocolate milkshake. The salad was a bit overpriced and also a little underwhelming but I loved the milkshake. It was thick and tasted like it was made with nice quality ice cream. I just went back specifically for the chocolate milkshake and was horribly disappointed at what they gave me. I'm not exaggerating, it was the consistency of watered down chocolate milk. I'm never the type of person to complain at a restaurant but I was sure they had made a mistake. They said \"that's just how we make them-liquidy\" I couldn't believe it! I even told them that I had had one before that was much MUCH better and they maintained that they followed the recipe correctly. I am so disappointed with this place. It would be so convenient for me to pick up dinner on the way home but they have insulted the integrity of milkshakes everywhere!! Never going back."}
{"text":"A random find walking through the st Lawrence market area but I'm glad I found it. Apparently they just open up two weeks ago. So that's good   It's nice to have a nice burger place in area outside of Mcds or BK that are right on same block.  My burger was small but the patty was thick and juicy, still the price wasn't worth it but I have come back to find the right burger  The sweet potatoes fries was killer good and there drink were nice, this blueberry drink was awesome, true star"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place and I was pretty disappointed. It was healthy for sure but talk about overpriced salads for what you are getting. I got the apple salad with bacon (can't remember the exact name) but it had kale, cranberries, quinoa and barely and barely any pieces of avocado. They really cheaped out here and on the meat. The portion only looked big but it was mostly filled with kale. It was a $14 salad with tax and I totally expected more protein. It was a sherry vinaigrette dressing, a bit sweet but tasted alright. They also serve burgers here which most people said it's good here but we'll see if I want to come back again."}
{"text":"Man, I wish there were more healthy eateries like this in the Oakville/Mississauga area.  The only similar type place I know of is Cold Pressery in Mississauga, and they have a smaller selection of food (though everything is cold pressed and vegan).  This place has a bunch of vegetarian and vegan options and I dropped by to get 3 greens smoothie which had spinach, mint, lime, hemp seeds, almond milk and honey. It was delicious.    The other thing I really appreciate about this place is that they only buy from local farms, which is absolutely awesome.    Verdict: It's like a gourmet version of Freshii for about the same price, bigger portions and more ethical. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Well, now that I'm almost 8-9 months into a primarily plant based diet, I've learned a lot more on what is proper nutrition and improper nutrition.  This place has the same food as the other b.good location and the service was friendly.    However, after examining the smoothie menu, while healthy, none of the smoothies had any protein in them (i.e. hemp seeds would have been nice).    Verdict: It's healthy and it's great that most things are locally sourced, so an okay place to grab a quick healthy bite, but kind of pricey."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday at around 6pm for a quick dinner before heading to the Distillery District. It is a really short walk from there (approx. 15 mins), which is super convenient. It's a cozy place along Front Street, and the staff are friendly, but the food does leave a little something to be desired.   I had their veggie burger prepared in the seasonal \"Joanie\" style (avocado, homemade spicy slaw, and sriracha), one of my friends had the kale salad with chicken, and another friend had the veggie burger prepared \"Adopted Luke\" style (mushrooms, bbq sauce, carmelized onions, and gouda). The salad was well-received, but the veggie burgers were only so-so. My burger was so overpowered with heat/sriracha that I could barely even taste the patty. My friend's burger had so much barbeque sauce that she felt that she couldn't take the patty either. The patties themselves were okay, but pretty mushy and fell out of the bun after the first two bites. In my opinion, I would prefer to go to Hero Burger for a veggie burger than come back to b.good, they have better topping options there too. Maybe I'll try their bowls another time, but otherwise I would probably look for an alternate option in the area."}
{"text":"Obsessed with the power bowl and rosemary lemonade! I usually add chicken which brings total up above $18 (yikes!) But it's  healthy,  quick and damn tasty. Good service too."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers ice ever had from a $$ restaurant,the sweet potato fries were delicious,  and the blueberry soda was very good.  To top it off its all locally sourced ingredients so that adds to the reason why local folks should get behind restaurants like this.  Definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"WTG! We've been going to this b.good for a long time, in the past, the burgers, while creative and generally pretty/very tasty, were weighed down by long wait times and smaller portions.  Things have changed for the much better!  Wait times have gone way down, and the burger is now larger (perfect size) and arguably better (I won't get into specifics, but good work), easily one of the best in Oakville."}
{"text":"Overall pretty happy with the food here. Ordered the spicy avocado and lime bowl, healthy and delicious! If you are looking for a clean sit down \"healthy fast food\" then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"\"One of the best finishes after this meal was the fact that we didn't feel heavy nor get any heartburn. Overall, we had a wholesome experience at B. Good and could recommend it for all the burger lovers. Too bad the restaurant was not licensed for alcohol - a glass of cold, local brew could go well with the experience. \" \"It has a consistent message all around and, despite being a chain, maintains a personable attitude.\"  Just a few bites of our full review."}
{"text":"I had been to B Good once before (different location) which was very good.  This experience, however, was very very bad all around. We ordered 2 dinner salads for about $25, but they took 19 (NINETEEN) minutes to prepare them. The staff were cleaning the entire kitchen before they thought to serve us - we had to bug them just to get our food. And unlike my first time at this chain, these salads were tiny and not filling at all. I had to eat dinner after my appetizer of a salad bowl from this restaurant.  Then I found hard chunks of corn in mine, which could've chipped a tooth if I wasn't chewing carefully. The chicken in mine was sparse, and it was mostly just lettuce.  The cherry on top was the raging diarrhea I experienced the next morning.  NEVER GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"Decided to get my girlfriend a salad for dinner, she's never been to b.good. Got the Sweet Potato and Bacon salad, came home to find a bowl full of spinach with a couple chunks of sweet potato  with no bacon in sight. Really disappointed to get this for $12. Looked at the other photos from this location and have no idea why I ended up with a salad like this. I've been to other locations before and have never been so disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered off Hurrier (now Foodora) for a late dinner at work on a weekday and opted for b.good since my colleagues and I have heard good things. Unfortunately, I experienced the opposite. My order came from this location because of its proximity to our office.  I ordered the Toasted Almond & Ginger grain bowl with quinoa. Overall, very carelessly prepared, tasteless, minimal to zero sauce, and therefore, super bland. According to the menu, the veggies are allegedly sautéed - they might as well have been sautéed in air, because there was absolutely no flavour. The salad is also alleged to include almonds - there were exactly 3 almonds in my entire bowl, and yes, I was counting.  It felt like they completely scrimped on my order, with minimal effort, product and resources, which was extremely disappointing.   And as a reflection of food preparation and staff at this location, my order had no cutlery included, no napkins, with the salad bowl haphazardly and messily thrown into the delivery bag. Thankfully, I still had access to the cutlery in our office's kitchen - otherwise, I would have resorted to eating this lovely bowl with my hands (glamorous, I know).   For my order, with taxes and delivery fees, this one order, an average-sized bowl, cost around $19.00. A complete waste and a very disappointing meal. Will not be ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant seems interesting.  On a commercial marketing level, it has great appeal,when you walk in, the layout, the food presentation on billboards, it all seems, legit.  So I decided to try it.  After ordering and waiting about 15-20 mins, and the line starts to build, the person who takes the order at the cash comes to tell me that they are out of the burger i had ordered.  REALLY?  You made me wait 15 minutes to tell me that, and then apologize.  LOL.  So she came to apologize, and said we can give you free fries.  At least she admitted 'they made a mistake, and tried to correct the situation.  To be honest the food itself was below average, the burger was ...mediocre and the sweet potato fries were....like.....the worst....ive had better at hole in the wall bars.  All in all.. not impressed."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing grain bowl - local apple and bacon!!! It was amazeballs! I love be good, it is my post boxing class go to, and they never let me down. I also appreciate how the staff are all really friendly as I always ask for their recommendations on what is their favourite items.  Last but not least I tried the lucy blue smoothie with protein powder and it was super tasty, like dessert vibes. Thanks for always being there for this busy downtowner! I will definitely be working my way through the menu. :)"}
{"text":"If you come here, you may b.hungry, b.ripped-off, or b.mad, but you sure as hell won't b.good. Wow, this place really sucks. Paid $17.50 for a tiny under-cooked burger and side salad, and still hungry.  The burger was tiny, messy, and undercooked! I had to wait more than 15 min for it, and the cheese wasn't even melted! I wouldn't be so mad had it been an awesome burger, but it wasn't even good. Would much prefer going to the Works on Front St for a way better burger or even Hero burger around the corner. Heck, I would rather go to McD or BK, than eat here.   As for the Kale side salad, the vinegarette was horrible and the rest of the salad had no taste... I might as well be eating rabbit food. Again, right around the corner is Fast Fresh Foods, where I can get an infinitely better and cheaper salad.   Will I ever come back? You gotta b.kidding me! Hell no!"}
{"text":"I went and got the butternut squash salad with grilled chicken. It was around 15 dollars and I was sadly disappointed. The bowl wasn't even full - barely any spinach. Much better places close by - Buna's, Flock etc. I won't me going back."}
{"text":"B Good recently opened at King & Yonge and thought I would pop by for lunch as I work in the area. I was intrigued by their focus on local and seasonal ingredients.  The restaurant was pretty busy around 1230pm on a weekday. The lunch rush was in full effect. After ordering, I waited about 10mins for my food.  I ordered:  Adopted Luke Burger: 3.5/5. This burger had caramelized onions, gouda, sauteed mushrooms, and BBQ sauce. While tasty, it was quite messy. Okay, I know a burger consisting of these toppings wasn't going to be very neat to eat, but when I opened the packaging up, it was a gloopy mess. Poorly put together, but it was definitely tasty.  Sweet potato fries: 1/5. My sweet potato fries were burnt and soggy and barely warm. I don't know if this was a bad batch, or if the fry boy was still learning, but these fries were gross. I only had a few of them before I couldn't take it anymore. A couple of regular fries got mixed in with my order and they were also limp and had little flavour.  My total came to just under $14 - a bit pricey for lunch and didn't include a drink. I was tempted by their smoothies but that would have put my lunch total to over $20 so I passed.  Seeing as they opened so recently, I would come back again in a month or two to see if they've improved, especially in the fry department."}
{"text":"Came here with excitement as I had heard their salads were amazing. In fact we were the first ones in the door at 11am (nerd alert) to be met with a un-smiling employee who appeared completely disinterested in serving us. But wait, we are the first ones here, and we are excited to eat, why not be friendly? Ah well.  We ordered a salad to share, cannot recall the exact name, but it included roasted butternut squash and apples. And then ordered our own individual burgers. Total cost around $30-35 for 2 burgers, salad to share and free tap water.  I eagerly awaited my delicious food. The resto is very pleasant with nice clean bathrooms. Lots of seating. Our burgers arrived. Oh, a little small, maybe a 4 ounce patty? Flavour was meh. They tasted...healthy. Which means I'm sure they were lean and good for me. But also lean on the flavour.  Overall I found the serving sizes small and the food a little bland. My dream of a amazing creative salad shop in Oakville quietly ended. this place is ok, but I would not consider it amazing. My salad at Berkeley North in Hamilton recently, however, was tremendously delicious...  If I lived in the area, maybe I would come back. But otherwise would not make a special trip to Oakville for B good. Will check out Fresh in Hamilton instead (yup yup they opened a location in the Hammer!)  About an hour after eating I was hungry again."}
{"text":"The curry and grilled avocado bowl was delicious!! I also ordered the acai berry shake and I found it really refreshing. Overall, my lunch was fresh-tasting and tasted wholesome. The prices are a bit high. Staff were super nice! I will definitely be coming back to try out the burgers or other food bowls!"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from where I work. I love it! Especially their seasonal citrus & avocado salad and roasted butternut salad. Apple and bacon grain bowl is great too. The people are always friendly and service really is fast! Tried their beef burger for the first time today (cousin oliver style with smoked gouda and bacon) I felt much better about eating it than just a regular burger at some fast food place but it was a little dry, oh well. Still a great place to grab lunch!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for healthy grain bowls in Toronto. I came here with a friend and the food was delicious. I tried their quinoa bowl and It was really good and was served very fast. Prices were good too, not expensive at all."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting food. Low quality, bland and disappointing to say the least. Avoid this shit hole especially on Uber eats. I'm frustrated because I was hungry and dropped my standard pretty low to get something relatively quick.. big mistake. I can't even finish my food and I'm still starving!   Business like this should be shut down."}
{"text":"I don't usually search out these types of freshly sourced/healthy restaurants, but this one was recommended by one of my friends. It's a fast-casual style restaurant, although on this night the service was not particularly fast. I decided to get one of their burgers, and was honestly quite pleased. The patty meat tastes fresh and juicy which I guess is because of the unique ways they source their food. My only complaint with the burger itself is the patty is a bit small if you are feeling hungry. They also have their own selection of condiments and drinks that are unique to the restaurant. The prices were a little high for some items, especially to upgrade your burger to a combo, but overall was a solid experience."}
{"text":"Love that place! The food is as local as possible, healthy and really tasty. I also like the whole idea behind it and that they give information about where the food comes from. They have chicken I hear good things about and lots of vegetarian options, the spicy avocado and lime bowl is my favorite.   The restaurant itself is modern, clean and it's nice even with kids - they have highchairs and it's spacious enough to not be in the way with a stroller. Staff is very friendly. :)  I'm getting takeout most of the time and the app is amazing to order ahead of time plus you get rewards for going there frequently and are able to customize your order. A+++ just for that, it makes ordering so much easier."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant of all time. My go to is the local apple & bacon grains bowl with the kale crush smoothie. It so gives me energy. My kids love the Caesar salad and the amazing lemonade. When in season the corn or the chilli is so amazing. So many delicious items a must try for sure!!! Oh and everything is local and staff is so friendly and knowledgeable which makes a great experience."}
{"text":"First impression: clean environment, staff seemed friendly but many were on their phones in the back.   Pricing: wasn't expecting it to be cheap, but boy was that an expensive meal! It cost $17 for a burger with fries and a drink.   The food: my standards at this point were pretty high (considering the price). I've also been to many \"feel good home grown\" restaurants and I've had some pretty good experiences there. Once I got my food the first thing I noticed was that my sweet potato fries were burnt, they were also cold.   The taste: the sweet potato fries were surprisingly dry and burnt. The chicken was good, but the bread itself was not fresh at all. My friend had their burger. When I tasted that, the meat was horrible. It tasted like someone over packed it with their hands, it didn't sit right at all. ALL of our fries were cold, dry, and burnt, one of my friends complained about the fries and she received a new batch that tasted much better, was hot and not burnt at all.   Overall experience: it's really too bad what happened, I don't know if the food is always like this or we happened to come on the wrong day. After asking friends who've tried this location they all agree that it was not their best experience either. I would not recommend this place if you're really looking for a bang for your buck. I just hope they take this review as constructive criticism to change what they can!"}
{"text":"The customer service was atrocious.  They couldn't answer simple questions like, which food was organic, or whether they accepted a specific discount card.  The staff are completely lost.  They messed up my order.  It also took them 10 minutes to ring it in.  Only gave me half of it, and forgot the burger, no joke.  They didn't even put my whole order in a bag for me.  Then when I walked outside with my order, the whole takeout order fell apart.  The price is expensive, $17 for side salad and burger, and I couldn't even get decent customer service.  Definitely don't come here. It's not worth it. I will go back to my other veggie burger places like the Epicure or Fresh which are in the area.    The food was great tasting, clean, but the burger portions were small.  It's too bad since I thrive off of clean, organic, local vegetarian food."}
{"text":"Got the spicy avacado & lime bowl and it was so delicious. Trying to eat healthy can be boring but this dish really surprised me."}
{"text":"Bgood is not good. When I first came to this location, it was good especially like their salads. But I had no luck with my favorite sweet potato fries. Every time I had it it was burnt. This is not the first time. I seem to get left over burnt pieces or are they all like that?"}
{"text":"Small portions. No flavour. Unnecessarily pricey. SO disappointed. My smoothie tasted like water with a hint of strawberry seeds. I had never had bad fries in my life until this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday winter evening, Walked in to find that there are a few tables out front, but this place is pretty small.  Luckily it was a cold night with not many people out.    Ordered the West-Side Burger with a lettuce wrap and fries.  There are plenty of healthier options on the menu, of which I should have selected, but felt like something less healthier. You give your name when you order, and a few minutes later they call you at the pick-up counter that is nearly at the back of the place.    Grabbed my food and sat down.  Must say the size of the burger is pretty underwhelming.  The first bite in and the fresh toppings make the burger !  The fries were really good too.  The meal that ordered was actually a combo, so I got a drink.  They had lemonade on tap there.  So decided to go with that.  Again, I was pleasantly surprised.    Overall, nice place, good choices for eating healthy, and the fresh toppings on the burger were a bonus.  Yup, I'll go back, but likely try something a bit better for me... ie: roasted brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this healthy gem the other day while taking a stroll in my new neighbourhood! The outdoor signage definitely roped me in -- a fast food place with a veggie-based menu!  I really like that their fresh bowls do away with noodles or rice, and use kale and quinoa instead. I find it to be way more satisfying, tasty, and \"no filler.\" The curry and grilled avocado is amazing -- satisfying and full of flavour. You can add some sliced chicken in there for a couple more bucks. Though very vegan-friendly they also have beef & turkey burgers, along with veggie options as well. Their shakes are also quite good.  Not totally keen on the environment, which makes me think of a late-night burrito place. A more chill vibe would make me want to dine there, but for now it feels like a take-out option. Though it appears they have a large patio space in the works, so the summer could be a total game-changer on a busy corner like Front & Jarvis. I do like (keeping with the fast food vibe) that their pop machine pumps healthier alternatives to Coke and Pepsi.  Food is a little pricey but expected for quality ingredients. Well worth the price.  I've been here quite a few times now, and really happy every time. I'm very excited that a healthy spot is around the corner from my house. Looking forward to exploring the menu even further -- which includes a nutrition chart for all their food. Pretty handy!  NOTE: I highly recommend joining their \"family\" because membership has its privileges: I've already received free soup, fries, and chili for my loyalty!"}
{"text":"Burgers are usually in my book: ah whatever or wow amazing. But this was so bad! Tasteless, bun to meat ratio was off and the bun was hard. Fries were beyond dissappointing. Kale smoothie was well, a kale smoothie. Nothing special or differentiating about it. It was probably the best part of my meal so thats dissappointing given this is supposed to be a burger joint. Was there with 3 buddies and all of us were pretty pissed about our meal as non of us enjoyed the burgers and we tried three different burgers.   Service was great and place was clean."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for a light lunch on a Saturday before our weekly grocery run.  We had high hopes for this place, since we generally appreciate \"real food\".  Unfortunately, we were both disappointed.  We both had beef burgers, and while the ingredients were obviously good quality, the burgers were bland.  The fries were good, however, and I liked the unique fountain drink options.  I will probably try the place again for one of their kale/grain \"bowls\", because I do like the concept.  But I'll stick to Big Smoke Burger otherwise."}
{"text":"It's my first time at this place in Toronto. I ordered the veggie burger west side. It was ok but was lacking in flavour. I would have loved to get more flavour out of it."}
{"text":"Somewhat vegan friendly, mostly locally sourced ingredients, counter service.  They use the word \"vegan\" a couple times on the menu, but they don't use any special symbols -- so you'll need to quiz the staff to find out what is/isn't vegan, which is always a gamble.  But this time it worked.  My vegan burger was pretty good.  The only person at the table who wasn't happy with their meal was the carnivore, who ordered a normal meat-based burger.  Fries are just so-so."}
{"text":"Love the veggie burger and the fries and sweet potato fries are amazing. Had a bowl for the first time today and it was pretty good.  The only qualm I have with b. Good is that they appear to grill the tofu on the same grill as they do their bacon.  I don't know if there's a system as far as placement is concerned so if there is disregard this suggestion but if not I'd suggest for the sake of the vegetarians and vegans that visit you that that is remedied.  Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"Just attended an event today catered from b.good and the guy said they have Restaurant locations in Toronto and Oakville. The food was so fresh and healthy and enjoyed by all the gym rats and iron men in my company. There were chicken, turkey and vegetarian sliders but the buns were not gluten free. Best to just put toppings on the burger without the bun and eat with a knife and fork. The veg burger topped with the avocado, chipotle sauce and salsa was excellent.  There were several fresh salads with kale, quinoa and various other ingredients....one had cheese in it and another had meat in it. There was also a table with toast, guacamole, fresh almond butter (too salty for me), fruit, boiled eggs, nuts, seeds, dry figs and cranberries and packaged vegan/gf brownies and other healthy treats. They brought a delicious lemonade and a beet juice as well as lots of water. My tummy was in heaven and I can't wait to try one of their restaurants!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the other reviews here are so harsh. To me B Good is on par with other 'real' or 'healthy' food options in the Financial District. It is no more of a rip off than IQ, Kupfert and Kim or Chipotle might be. Perhaps the location is one block too far for the lawyers and investment bankers and too expensive for folks venturing south of the Eaton Centre.  The inside reminds me of Chipotle, only much cleaner and much brighter. It's all wood with green chairs for accent. They have an efficient queuing system, ample seating for lunch and free WiFi. The food comes out quickly even when busy.  The key food offerings are kale and grain bowls, burgers, salads and healthy smoothies. The bowls are substantial in size and a bit different to other nearby offerings. My favorite thing to order is a burger. They have a variety of patties (including vegan) and you can select your add ons from a custom list of suggestions. I like Westside the best. Of the juices I recommend the Big C and acai berry. Lucy Blue tasted a little too much like cinnamon.  One other big differentiator for B Good is their above and beyond loyalty program. I've been offered gifts (complimentary food items) numerous times for downloading the app, participating in competitions and as an apology if I've ever had to wait. They've also let me try new items in advance of them being added to the menu. The app itself is also fairly sophisticated - you pay or redeem gifts by via QR code scan. They track your purchases for loyalty rewards etc. It makes me feel like they value their customers."}
{"text":"Thumbs down for the veggie burger! I ordered one made as 'Adopted Luke' which was mushrooms, caramelized onions, smoked gouda, and BBQ sauce. The veggie patty itself wasn't flavourful and didn't have a great texture. The mushrooms were overcooked, I didn't taste or see any smoked gouda, and the BBQ sauce didn't taste too great with it. I left feeling a bit sickly. Burger King has an awesome veggie burger though and it doesn't cost ~$14 as a combo!"}
{"text":"I've never been here so this review is just for their delivery (through hurrier)  YUM! It's so good, everything is all-natural and their menu is simple with many options to choose from.   I usually get one of the burgers with veggies instead of the bun with some extras (avocado and bacon) and it's so filling yet very light. Also, its prices are fair. I don't usually pay more than $15 for my meal (with the add-ons)  It's probably my favourite place to order from on hurrier right now. and it comes really quick!"}
{"text":"While this place can certainly be considered a \"healthy\" meal option, it isn't my first choice in the Financial District (Kupfert & Kim is still my number one). However, with that said, b.Good has grown on me, once I figured out what to order based on my preferences. I had a pretty terrible experience with another one of their locations, but this particular one has brought the experience a step up.   First, location. Note that this is located on the northeast corner of Yonge St. and King St. It's located right beside Beer Bistro. There's a good amount of seating inside, and it's bright and clean (always a plus).  Second, prices. Yes, it's pricier than you would expect. If you're ordering a salad (which I normally do at lunch), you'll do it here at a double digit price point. While that isn't any different from the higher end \"healthy\" options in the area, what bothered many colleagues (and myself) was how less substantial it felt. For example, I paid around $12.00 for the Harvest Kale bowl, which was really just a whole whack of kale with very, very little else - it felt like a whole lot of nothing and I felt terribly ripped off. We could have paid that much at iQ Foods, but with more protein and toppings.   Third, recommendations re: their salads. I realized that, to feel like you got some semblance of value to your meal, you might want to order the bowls that already have protein built in. For example, their Southwestern Chicken Salad Bowl, or their Local Apple & Bacon, or even their Farmstand Tomato-Basil Kale & Grain Bowl (with thick slabs of cheese). These have ended up being my go-to salads, with the Farmstand being one of the better ones.  Overall, b.good is not my first choice, but it isn't terrible, and I'll be back for certain items that I felt were more substantial (and gave more sustenance). If you're prepared to pay double digits for a salad, take the time to check this place out, but note that there are other competitive options out there.   Lastly, to give you an idea on pricing. On my most recent visit, I paid around $13.00 for my Local Apple & Bacon Kale & Grain Bowl."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to check this place out for lunch on a chilly Sunday afternoon. Upon arrival, I perused the menu and decided to order the El Guapo burger, which contains \"bacon, homemade jalapeno ranch, lettuce, tomato, onion\" (but I should mention that it also included surprisingly spicy jalapeno slices as I well).  The food finally arrived about 10 minutes later and I immediately dug into my promising-looking burger. The first bite was mostly meat and I quickly realized that something was amiss. The burger patty contained this undefinable, palpably weird taste, to the extent that my dining companion, who also ordered a burger, wondered aloud if he had accidentally ordered an elk burger.  Far more problematic, however, was the dryness of the patty. This might have been the driest hamburger I've eaten in ages. It was so dry that I had difficulties swallowing it. I'm not sure how lean the meat here is, but it's clearly much, much leaner than a burger should be.  My dining companion, who agreed that the burger was punishingly dry, also ordered the fries, which also failed to impress. The fries are baked rather than fried and they consequently suffer from a tastelessness and a lack of crunch one expects from a French fry. The saving grace was the ketchup, as the restaurant offers Sir Kensington's Ketchup as a condiment and it's probably one of the best ketchups I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"I only started going to B. Good about a year ago. As I am a vegetarian and pretty much vegan, there aren't a lot of affordable, quality burger and salad places in the Bay Street business district downtown. What I find especially great is that B. Good is in frequent touch with customers to get their opinions and also acknowledge being a customer. For my last visit, I purchased a blueberry smoothie that was such a great size that it was practically a meal. I've had the veggie burgers in the past, and have always found them delicious - cooked just enough and with plenty of toppings without paying extra. I actually got the chili side recently as well, and even though it's a side dish, it was almost enough for a meal. Definitely a handy place to pick up food or eat if you can't cook yourself."}
{"text":"Still love the b.good restaurant!  I frequent this place whenever I'm in the area.  My food are always made to perfection with my stomach feeling satisfied.  I ordered the southwestern chicken salad and all the ingredients/condiments complemented each other.    You can order through their b.good app or ritual.  Food is prepared in a timely manner.    Be sure to download their b.good app for their specials and promotions!!"}
{"text":"Had the veggie burger with caramelized onions, smoked gouda and bbq sauce (forget the name of the combination). The veggie burger is a grain and bean base - overall great menu and quality ingredients . The burger was pretty good and sweet potato fries were ok , slightly less crispy than I prefer.   What was great was the service, very friendly and accommodating! Meals take a bit of time to prepare which likely indicates fresh prep time - but putting it out there in case your looking for a fast bite.   Also their beverage selection is great! The beet lemonade tasted very beet-y but really fresh and flavourful and the rosemary lemonade was very light on the rosemary making it an innovative twist on the norm. They also offer a range of flavourful  carbonated options including mexican cola   A good choice for a light fresh meal with a bit of flare"}
{"text":"B Good is somewhere I can count on that has super tasty and delicious salad - I love their Southwestern Chicken Salad and sweet potato fries!! The portions are pretty good too, I don't leave feeling hungry. Took a tad long at the cash register but overall got great service. Shout out to the crew working at the evening of Friday (May 5) - the dude especially working the cash/salad bar and the woman cooking were super friendly! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The place has the potential of being better than I've rated it. However, the staff is too young and very inexperienced.  At these prices there should be proper supervision and service at a table.  The food was \"ok\" but i guess my expectations were higher than what i received.  I was charged for  a la carte when i ordered a combo, the fries were soggy and my brussel sprouts were hard as a rock after waiting 20 mins or more.  I wanted to like it so much which is probably why my expectations were so high. I don't recommend it and probably won't go back - i hope it improves because we need more if this concept out there - good luck!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.   I have been to both this location and the one on King street and they are the same (food, decor, cleanliness, service) therefore my review will be for both locations.   I have had the avocado lime salad with quinoa the first and second time I visited B.Good and added tofu to it. If you like a little extra spiciness, request the jalapeño sauce.   I have also tried the veggie burger on a paleo/keto friendly bun which was amazing. The veggie burger isn't dry (which is sometimes a big problem) and the bun is out of this world. So cool to be able to enjoy a burger without all the carbs!   The service is always friendly and fast enough given the type of food they serve. Do not expect McDonald's type of speed when eating actual food."}
{"text":"Delicious salads and bowls. I ordered take out from B.Good and ate it home but from what I have witnessed, I would say the service is extremely friendly and fast. I truly appreciated the freshness of the ingredients and the wonderful, unique flavours. I would give a 5 stars but I believe the prices/portion ratio isn't quite right. It is a tad expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"I tried a grain bowl the other night because I got a free coupon through the app. Coupon was for salad, bowl, or burger and I chose the power bowl. I ordered through the app and the bowl was ready when I arrived to pick it up 10-15 minutes later. I gave the cashier my name and he grabbed by bag from the kitchen counter area.   I generally find these sorts of \"healthy fast-food\" places to be overhyped or poor value but I really loved this bowl! It was huge, so although I didn't pay for this one I wouldn't hesitate for pay for it another time. It was very filling, with mixed grains, kale, roasted brussels sprouts and chickpeas, topped with tomato vinaigrette. A great combination of flavours! Highly recommended for an easy lunch or dinner in the Yonge and Eglinton area."}
{"text":"Honestly I usually give places two visits even if I was unimpressed the first time but because my BF and I split both the power salad and the burger with a side of chili -we won't be coming back or  Ordering on Uber Eats again.  It's hard to mess up a salad but they managed. The kale needed to be massaged or marinated because it was dry and there was not enough goodies in the salad to compensate. Even after being delivered.  The burger to bun ratio was off, the patty was decent and we enjoyed the toppings we chose but the bun over powered and it came across as dry.  Chili was good but reminded us of something generic. Tim Hortons would be comparable.  Nothing stood out. We won't be having cravings for here, disappointing to say the least"}
{"text":"Either staff are not trained or owners don't care. We just ordered burgers for the first time. Toppings where thrown on and minimal. Obviously no care or pride in the food. 1 burger had 1 single flat piece of lettuce The other had 3 small pieces of cabbage that was suppose to be \"coleslaw\" For $8.50 each it was a joke. For that price toppings should be pulled high. The buns (1 white and 1 whole wheat) where both stale. This place needs help big time. Embarrassing."}
{"text":"It was just ok.  Burger tasted pretty bad * bland and tasteless meat and came on a cold bun.  Zucchini and eggplant meatballs salad was so-so.  I didn't like that the zucchini noodles was soaked in some kinda sauce, so it became really soggy.   Eggplant meatballs was the saving grace for the dish.  Still, I probably wouldn't order this dish again.  Spent around $30 for the meal.   Not sure the taste of the food is worth this price.   If I'm paying $30 for two meals, it better taste pretty darn good.   Truly felt the food didn't live up to its name."}
{"text":"I've honestly tried to like this place, I want to like it. I've been 4 times now and there is absolutely nothing redeeming about their burgers. The buns are terrible, the patties have no taste, and the \"sweet\" pickles are awful. This is not technically their fault as they are going for organic, all natural everything but no ketchup besides Heinz is acceptable. I've asked many people and all feel the same way it's not just me with this 'ketchup rule'. Their ketchup is almost like jelly. I want to give this place a 1 star but it is very clean inside and it is nice how it shows all the sources of their food. Apparently the salads are what you come here for so maybe I'll try it once more and get a salad."}
{"text":"Ordered my meal off UberEats! Can't really comment on the atmosphere and service of the restaurant. Rating is based mainly on the food I ordered. Had the Southwest Chicken sandwich and it was good and flavourful. Chicken wasn't dry. I was able to get it with a whole wheat bun but I wish it was toasted. Got good reviews from friends who had turkey burger and one of their kale bowls. Will order from here again!"}
{"text":"First time going to B.Good, clean place. Great staff and fast service.   Tried the - SPICY AVOCADO & LIME - Marinated kale, sautéed veggies, avocado, black beans, corn, grape tomato, feta, lime, cilantro, chipotle sauce  Probably one of the most unique salads I had in a long time. The ingredients were fresh, avocado wasn't brown, great chipotle sauce, all the ingredients complemented each other and went well with the bed of warm quinoa at the bottom. - ** Would recommend adding chicken **.   Not a pro at salads but I would put the quantity as average-ish/kinda and the pricing to be nominally higher than other places. But I still enjoyed it, and would try it again. Wouldn't go everyday but once in a while its a good option. I like the salad combinations, and ingredient list, just wanted a bit more in my bowl, got hungry after work     -_-."}
{"text":"Food was good and tasted fresh. Price is not fast-food cheap but also not gourmet unreasonable. Me and a co-worker had the Turkey Burger (West-Side & Adopted Luke). Another had another Adopted Luke with the regular beef patty. Waiting for the food was a little slow to our liking. And it's not even 12noon yet, so that's a little disconcerting.  Overall, it's not a bad place to have lunch. I'll probably come back soon to try some of the salad. I was eyeballing some of the other table's plates and they all look scrumptious! Will update this review once I do."}
{"text":"2.5* I was blown away by the food during a recent YEE, so I decided to pop in at the end of a long week for dinner.  I'm disappointed to report that the food wasn't as good this visit.  Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes?  I was dying to try one of their burgers - after all, it's sourced from local beef - so I ordered the seasonal burger, the Goomba with arugula, wild mushrooms, & smoked gouda.  Sounds good, right?  Not really.  Wild mushrooms were similar in texture to king oysters, but in caps, chopped in chunks.  I couldn't taste the arugula or cheese and I didn't care for the orangey-red sauce.  Patty wasn't seasoned, on the dry side, and I did taste a burnt piece.  Overall, the components didn't taste good together.  Burger itself was ~$8 (small, but adequate size) and I added a drink/sweet potato fries combo for an additional $4.79.  Sweet potato fries could've been crispier.  And who can resist the unique fountain drinks?  I found drinks were still very sweet though, so FYI to all parents!  I had to water them down.  Bf ordered the Power Bowl ($12).  I didn't taste it, but he insisted that I have a piece of the fried egg on top because he said it was cold.  And in fact, the egg was unexpectedly COLD.  (I preferred the Spicy Avo & Lime Bowl, but he can't handle spice, so he didn't order that.  Otherwise, I think he would've enjoyed that bowl much better.)   I'm not sure if the other reviews mentioned this, but DO NOT EXPECT McD's timed delivery for  your food.  I believe I waited approx. 20mins for a bowl & burger.  I would go back again and really think this place has tons of potential, but it isn't quite there yet."}
{"text":"The environment here is clean, and the place had quite a few people on a Tuesday afternoon, so it's safe to say that b.good is probably a popular lunch spot around this area considering the price and food selections.   I got the west side chicken burger and it was pretty good. The Avocado cilantro fresh salsa chipotle purée and lime topping was delicious with the grilled chicken. Portion was decent for a sandwich, with a thick chicken piece combining nicely with the avocado (I don't think it was chicken breast tho).   Total came to under $10. Didn't get fries although they are thickcut and looked super good.   Cashier was very nice as I was very indecisive :)   I do recommend this place if you are in the area looking for something quick but not 'too fast food'."}
{"text":"I always thought about ordering from this place when I saw it on uber eats but never did. Then my friend did and when I saw her order I had to!!! I got the spicy avocado bowl with chicken and it was so good. I'm obsessed- defs going to be one of my new local go to restos.   Love it- happy I finally got it"}
{"text":"The food was very fresh.  I got the westside beef burger and fries.  The root beer pop was local and made with fresh ingredients.  The beef was juicy and full of flavour.  The beef is house ground.  It does taste fresher than the ground beef that you purchase at your neighbourhood supermarket.  The toppings were tasty and plentiful.  Ketchup is homemade as well.  Fries were seasoned.  I would definitely go back but would get one of their chicken salads.   You pay more than the traditional fast food joint but you get quality food.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Had nice gluten free buns and the fries are gluten free as well. Was quick to get our food and you just walk in and order straight away"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. The employees are mad friendly and honestly willing to bend over backwards to help as much as possible.  Right on the corner of Portland and queen, this place is sometimes hard to miss if you're not paying attention. Healthy and vegan options. Anything from salads to burgers. & guess what?  Milkshakes and smoothes too. Treat yourself.  I usually order for take it since I work near by. Most def a place you should check out if you're on a health binge but it's cheat day without cheating."}
{"text":"Great burger, fries and soda selection. The burgers have juicy, thick patties, and made with quality ingredients. Fries are thick cut and they have a soda fountain with Maine Root pop.  I can't speak for their bowls, or vegetarian options. My go to burger is the Adopted Luke."}
{"text":"came across this place one Sunday after a baking class me and my coworker had gone to.  I was intrigued by the healthy fast food slogan, but none the less I would say they have lived up to that slogan. I mean check my pictures out, its like a healthy heart attack burger (no sarcasm involved). The place was small and cozy, however there was a stench, not sure what it was or where it was coming from but it wasn't a good smell. There drinks were quite unique too as I had Beet pop (yes, BEET POP.. made out of real beets).  I had a grilled chicken sandwich, which I had to force finish because it was massive and I couldn't finish it, but crazy enough I wasn't tired or did not feel super heavy after eating the sandwich. The fries were fairly good, its no McDonald's fries but none the less still great fries. you were also able to substitute for sweet potato fries, which now that I think about, don't even know why I didn't substitute. oh well if any of you try the sweet potato fries you guys can just tell me how they were.   The beet pop made out of real beets, I have to say, I was impressed, I am not one to choose a beet drink over anything, but I thought, what the heck, lets give it a try, and guess what! I liked it! It was good, and if you don't like eating beets, maybe you should try drinking Beets pop!   As for the place, the table settings were cute and the decorations were interesting, I would not say its over the top, I think its a fitting place for the type of food they were serving.  The one thing I did not like was they had homemade ketchup that I wanted to try. I was willing to try and I went for a pump and this white-reddish liquid came out that had a sour vinegar smell to it, and it sprayed all over my clothes and all over the counter. I told the cashier and she didn't seem surprise, so I stuck to the good old heinz packets that they had on the side and left the homemade ketchup as is."}
{"text":"I came home opened the orders of sweet potatoe fries and a cockroach jumped off the plate into the sink. I brought a cockroach home to my condo building compliments of the Front Street location. Thank you. Been calling all night no answer. Enough said. Been going a long time but my last time. Huge risk."}
{"text":"I quite like B.Good. Their focus on local/fresh/small farm ingredients really shows, and their recipes are excellent. My wife and I eat here often. Lots of good veg/vegan options and gluten free choices/modifications too. Food comes out fast, is well priced and tastes good.  The bowls are excellent, well spiced and flavoured. My wife and I have tried them all at this point and it's hard to go wrong. Adding egg/tofu/chicken to all of them is a nice touch for more protein.  I haven't tried the salads though my wife eats them frequently and really enjoys them. The burgers are good, I've tried a few and liked them all. I'd avoid the whole wheat buns, they seem a little less fresh than the white the three times I went that route. The gluten free buns are quite good I'm told by a family member who is celiac.   The only thing that holds me back from giving 5-stars is there are fairly frequent consistency problems. The ingredient ratios don't seem to be very consistent, sometimes a bowl will have a ton of X or very little Y, and a week later it's the opposite. It's never resulted in BAD food, but it is better sometimes than others. Similarly for the burgers, they're sometimes a bit overcooked/dry, sometimes quite juicy. If the crews could get this under control it would be pretty flawless execution.   Drinks are also great, good election of healthier 'soft drinks' and smoothies. I really do like this place, and it's an awesome edition to the area. Lots of healthy and fast choices, plenty of choices for veg/vegan or gluten free."}
{"text":"When they passed me a free green smoothie out of their promotional truck on Front St East one block pass St. Lawrence Market, I knew good things in the fast food department were on their way to the East side!  Nestled near Burger King and McDonalds I was flabbergasted to find a new organic \"aroma\" of sweet potato fries, bean and lentil burgers, and freshest smoothies anyone can gulp down.   I cannot Stop gushing about B GOOD and I'm a Regular here.  On my first visit I tried their 3 green smoothie, which is Green, fresh, cold, and sweetened with honey. It is the mother of tastiness of all smoothies but does have only 6 grams of protein (info for muscle buffs out there). I also ordered their Veggie burger which is as clear from any Soy ingredient as is White after labour day!! It is made of beans and lentils and other alkaline goodness!! I paired the burger with their \"West Side\" flare. It consist of salsa, avocado, and other goodness on a Gluten Free bun. This burger ended up being extremely tasty; it is high in protein but also high in carbs, but the bursting flavours in your mouth are worth every 69 grams of it.  One thing I absolutely love about this place is that, they make delicious food with real ingredients and they list all the nutrition and ingredients on their website. It doesn't get simpler then this and their name reflects their humble simplistic approach to delicious fast food.   I promise I will always B Good when it comes to my food choices ;-)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here - the prices are kind of harsh, but the food is good!  So far I've hard the harvest kale salad and the southwest chicken salad. Both are good but the southwest chicken is phenomenal! I really enjoy their sweet potato fries - they're a bit crispy and a bit mushy inside (which I really like). They're on the expensive side though. $4-$5 for a serving. No size options for anything. Burgers, fries and salads are all one standard size. They cater to vegetarians and gluten free but they also have \"regular\" food too. The thing I really like is the big menu on the wall indicates if things are gluten free and that's just the way they're made - they don't require adjustments (except for the burger, because of the bun). I've yet to try the burgers yet. The salads and sweet potato fries have kept me coming back far more often than I should. The food is healthy, local and clean. So you'll pay more, but it's really not much higher than every where else these days.  One annoying thing - sometimes the food takes really long. I spent 30 mins of my lunch waiting for my food one day, and the next time it was 10 minutes. Really hit and miss with that."}
{"text":"Always a go to for healthy lunches. I tend to order the turkey burger as it's flavourful but still light. Also, the patio is always nice to sit and eat on!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I love that they are supporting local with many of their ingredients and make it fairly seasonable. I haven't tried any of their bowls. I've been three times now, with the best intentions to try a delicious looking and healthy bowl but break down and always get the burger.   Why? Because it is the best burger this gluten-free glutton has had since being forced into axing gluten-y goodness. The GF bun is actually soft and delicious and doesn't crumble apart. I can pile on as much mayo, ketchup and mustard as my heart desires. I can choose from a number of different kinds of burger (but I do love old school cheese and bacon!). And they grind the beef daily so it's not super greasy nor is it a flat, processed patty.   They are losing a star for their fries. One of the few places I can actually eat the fries because they aren't cross-contaminated with gluten, but, alas, they are baked and on the soggy side.   We had to share a chocolate milkshake for dessert. So rich. So creamy. And very chocolate-y. They also have killer lemonades too that come in unique flavours (beet!?) that are fun to try."}
{"text":"I like the concept but feel ripped off after eating here. I ordered an almond lime grain bowl, it was $13.50. It was basically cheap kale, with a few chunks of undercooked carrots, one small piece of Bok Choy, only about 4 almonds. No lime!! One measly strand of emoji mushrooms, and a thimble of dressing pored on the side, not even mixed or dispersed. The whole thing was flavourless and worth $5 tops. Not coming back again"}
{"text":"We checked out this new b.good on opening weekend, no less!   While the place was pretty empty, it was an unseasonably freezing raining Sunday, so I don't think that speaks to the places future. It's beautifully designed, with photos of the farmers on every table and lots of information available about their principles and what the chain is all about.   The menu itself looks fantastic - it isn't too large, with options including burgers, salads, shakes and bowls, all with local ingredients of course!   I tried the bowl with avocado, red pepper and curry cauliflower and was very impressed! I also got to sample the bowl with lime and hot sauce - also delicious! Both dishes were full of flavour and a good amount for dinner!   I won't hesitate to go back - I can't wait to try the beet ginger lemonade, the burgers and the delicious seasonal sides! Also once the weather is seasonal - the giant patio!"}
{"text":"I had order the Chicken as the Turkey is discontinued.  Had the burger the other night which was  good but not worth the $14.   Paid $20 for the chicken on a bun with a side kale salad.  Salad was ok chicken was made around lunch time (my dining experience was at 8pm).    I can't speak for the other locations but eglinton will be closed within a few months if not sooner  if things don't change.   Recommend Take out from any other locally sourced quick Serve restaurant for better value and freshness."}
{"text":"Take a break from your mediocre St. Lawrence Market lunch of mayonnaise and get something healthy. Expensive, but worth it, and the bowls could easily feed two. One star off because I ordered a bowl 'no dressing' and the components were remarkably salty on their own. I've never seen so many people on a kitchen line in my life."}
{"text":"Had the Adopted Luke burger on a whole wheat bun with side sweet potato fries. The fries were baked as opposed to deep fried which did take a bit longer, but they were delicious. I waited about 10 minutes for my order. The price was $13, which is a bit steep, but the quality was worth it. I enjoyed every bite!"}
{"text":"Simple quick eats sort of thang. I got a grilled chicken westside burger (guac, chipotle sauce, salsa), and my boyfriend got the el guapo (beef, bacon - and he forgets what else was in there - clearly not a memorable burger). It was very mediocre. We probably wont go back again, as there are tons of other places to eat. Filled the tummy though, but it was very blah.  Chicken was over cooked - a bit dry. Their buns were really dry too. Sauce was bleh.  Everything was very blah."}
{"text":"The food is good - but it's expensive ($20 for a burger, fries and bottled drink) and takes FOREVER."}
{"text":"The burgers here are so delicious! They taste fresh and \"real\" indeed. I tried the original beef burger with El Guapo toppings and it was amazing! The only downside is the size - the burgers are quite small. On the other hand, they taste awesome. I've tried lots of burgers all over the city and this spot might be the best one! Also, I loved their homemade lemonade - healthy and delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered from this place. Bgood is a chain that always have good food. We ordered lime avacodo bowls to deliver. The food was yummy, just for delivery, they forgot to bring one of the bowls but that's okay. They always use fresh ingredients and their salad dressings are one of a kind. I also like Freshii and Calii Love but Bgood is by far my favorite. They also have locations in the US, if you go."}
{"text":"First and last time   I work in the downtown core and often eat out or pick something up for lunch.  Today, for the first time, I visited the B. Good location on King St just east on Yonge.  There are many lunch options in the area and I am always willing to try a new place. As I said, this was my first there, but it will also be my last time there.  When I went, it was not busy.  As I perused the menu board above the cash register, I noticed the cashier typing away on the screen.  There was no one ahead of me and she did not greet me or make eye contact, or smile.  You know, things that are generally common place in the service industry.  Perhaps she was busy on the monitor in front of her.  But I digress.  As I was ready to order, I wasn't sure if she was actually ready to take my order due to her monitior-typing activities.  I thought I heard her mumble \"yes\", but I wasn't certain as she did not look up at me.  Apparently, however, that was my signal to order as she eventually took her eyes away from the screen and looked up, so I ordered a chicken Caesar salad to go. Oh yeah, she failed to thank me when I concluded the transaction.   It was ready fairly quickly and when I was called, I approached the pick-up counter and saw that it was not in a bag.  So I indicated to the employee (not the same as the cashier) that this order was to go.  She then happily invited me to put the salad in a bag myself.     As for the food, the salad itself came to around $11.00 with tax and tasted fine but was not very large.   Perhaps I'm old school, but if you appreciate good customer service, I don't recommend going to B. Good.  There are countless healthy lunch options in the area and those with better customer service will be the ones to get my business."}
{"text":"Great healthy place, eat here if you want something fresh, tasty and healthy"}
{"text":"I wish we didn't live in a world where $14 salads were a thing. But we do, so I guess its nice that some of them at least approach feeling like this is not an insane amount to spend on what is largely greens and grains. The power bowl at b.good is one such salad. Its got enough substance to fill you up for a few hours. What does this mean? Well I'll tell you: kale, carrots, brussels sprouts, roasted chickpeas, pepitas, a fried egg and a tomato vinaigrette. It also comes on your choice of organic quinoa or super grains. I prefer the super grains because its a more interesting flavour profile, but its not gluten free if thats a thing you care about. Eat it when you have to go back to work and not fall asleep at your desk. Or when you have to go try on clothes at one of the stores on Queen west and not feel bloated in those damn fluorescent-lit mirrors."}
{"text":"I've been here a ridiculous number of times. Because a close friend and I work near here, it's a good spot to meet up for lunch. Their menu is great, and I love the vibe. It accommodates both people who want something quick, as well as sit-down lunches for chilling. They have an outdoor patio which is especially nice for sunny, warm days.   Their menu is great - very well rounded, healthy options. They are priced slightly above other fast food options, but it's very understandable. The only problem I have with this place is that their service tends to be slow. It's likely that it's because I go there during lunch hour, but there is sometimes a 15 - 20 minute wait. For something that supposed to be quick and easy, it contradicts itself.   Other than the time problem, I think that B. Good is definitely a great, healthy option!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this place is good.  Or, rather, the burger is good. The place is a typical fast-food environment, the menu is limited, but the burger is an actually good sandwich and they have a novel selection of soft drinks . . . the price is right . . . good stuff."}
{"text":"3.5 - I was told by a friend that they make tastey salads here and it's healthy as well.  The person I ordered from was pretty helpful, when I asked what the favorites were.  I ordered the Toasted Almond Ginger salad bowl with mixed grains. I guess I can understand the price since there is a lot of stuff in it.  When I picked it up at the counter I felt kind of disappointed because it looked small and dry. Just to be sure, I asked them if it already had dressing in it. They looked at it again and asked if I wanted more on the side. So they were pretty helpful in giving me extra dressing on the side - which came in handy! Overall friendly helpful staff.  For me, the size of the salad was a bit small, but I'm not sure if that was the way it always comes or they skimped a bit this time. BUT I must say it was tastey!! I'm glad they sauted the kale a bit because I dont like eating that too raw. It was nice and warm but I did end up drowing it in the tastey dressing.  I would come back again to try the rest of the other salad bowls as well."}
{"text":"The disrespect I received from one of the kitchen staff when I asked \"what kind of oil is used to make the fries?\" was completely unacceptable. An eye roll and face palm? Guess you don't have any allergies. You deserve this 1-star rating for that kind of bs."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here. So convienent since I work just in the same plaza. Food is fresh and delicious. Service is great even when super busy. A lil pricey but so worth it. I continue to go back!!"}
{"text":"For $15 I had a healthy buffalo chicken sandwich on a whole wheat bun and a kale side salad. I was really feeling both of them, and I ordered them on Ritual which made the whole thing terribly easy. I'm a big fan of a healthier, fast food-style option, though $15 for a speedy lunch is pretty steep. If the price tag doesn't bug you, b.good is likely good for you, b."}
{"text":"I downloaded the app for the first time and received a coupon for a free kale and grain bowl. Definitely wanted to try it but I avoided it because it is on the pricier side. I'm happy I got to try the spicy avocado and lime bowl (I added the turkey burger patty to mine); it was delicious! Would definitely recommend it. I bought a beer and ginger lemonade. It was very \"beety\" but quite refreshing.   Reason for only 4 stars was that they did not add the corn (I know it was free, maybe that's why). Also, when I was given my meal, it was handed to me in the bowl; no bag no nothing. Not very pleasant to walk around Queen St with a big disposable bowl in my hand. Also, there was a manager there that was really rude to his coworkers and was yelling at one of the equipment delivery people. Not very professional and it was quite awkward waiting around with that happening.   Other than that, awesome place...however because of pricing, I wouldn't be going there too often."}
