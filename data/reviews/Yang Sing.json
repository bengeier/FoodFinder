{"text":"its a hard one to review, but i think my 1st gripe with the place is the name, cathay, nothing wrong with that, but the yang sing bit at the bottom, kinda lead me to believe it was of the same standard as the big yang sing in manchesters china town. or part of the yang sing restaurants.    though we enjoyed all the food, i would not class the food as restaurant standard. its more of your good take away style food, we only had the 1 dim sum dish, the char sui b0's and they where nothing special? in fact the char sui chow mein, on crispy noodles, the noodles had been put into fat that was not hot enough, to crisp them instantly, so they had absorbed some of the oil, before just going hard. the singapore vermicelli was a very good dish! with a choice of heat/hotness.    the char sui reminded me of the 70's, when some take aways had it on the menu, but just dyed the meat in red food colouring, so looked rather naff?    on the whole it was an enjoyable meal, the settings where a little, corny. the service was very good. portions, though not small, they were not exactly generous"}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food i've ever had with poor ignorant service to match.Tasteless rubbish with the cheapest chewiest Beef in the curry.You know how restaurant food is miles better than takeaway,this one is streets behind any of the local takeaways.Please dont waste your money on this place .Believe it or not,its expensive too."}
{"text":"The Orient section of  The Trafford Centre is packed full of restaurants and takeaways and The Yang Sing Orient Expression occupies the less sophisticated ground floor area. Yang Sing, wherever he is, would be horrified to lend his name to this offshoot because although I actually think the food here is okay, it is in no way related to the excellent cuisine served in the larger restaurants of the same chain.  This is just a takeaway and the staff are miserable and unresponsive. The queues here are always long and when you order you are given a numbered ticket- like the ones you take in hospitals waiting for a blood test- then your meal is nearly thrown at you, whilst the staff wear expressions which clearly say\" you have your food, now get lost\". Meal deals are just over a fiver and the sweet and sour chicken is very good although the fried noodles are very greasy. Orient Expression is the Chinese equivalent of a fast food joint, tasty, greasy, production line food. It breaks the monotony of McDonalds and KFC but every time I go there, the jacket potato place next door looks more and more tempting."}
{"text":"excellent value the food and staff were brilliant. the staff are so efficient and food comes very quickly well worth ending a day shopping in Trafford centre eating here."}
{"text":"Its good guys. It will not take the hungry world by storm but lets not forget its the nearest thing to a fast food chinese. And the dishes are fresh ( but not surprisingly we are ordering from a fast high turnover shopping mall site so it's got to be fresh.) Service I agree is so miserable, hey thats chinese for you (and before you point the racist finger at me. ........I am Chinese too, part of our culture is being miserable). Conclusion; it good fast food but why dont they sell more authentic plates like the traditional 3 roasts and wanton and brisket noodle soup."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a meal here on Monday night, it was pretty quiet, the staff were very attentive and delivered everything relatively fast. We started with a portion of prawn envelopes to share, these were pretty tasty but super heated, as you would expect from something deep fried. For my main I tried the mock chicken with green pepper and bean bean sauce, which was very enjoyable, and my boyfriend had beef with ginger and spring onions, which disappeared in seconds so I'm assuming it was also good. We have eaten here before, on a slightly busier night, but the food was just as good, only problem was it took them a while to bring us the bill. All in all, a very nice Chinese meal and would happily eat here again."}
{"text":"Yang Sing Cathay is an offshoot of Yang Sing and Little Yang Sing in the city centre, which if I have to be honest have been a little hit and miss themselves in recent years.   Unfortunately, this is a watered down, fast-food version of the China Town restaurants, with the food neither being as well presented or as tasty. The noodles were too greasy and the char sui very tough. Perhaps the chef was having a bad day, but I fear all too much that they just don't feel they have to put the effort in here. Shame."}
{"text":"There's a reason this is the only restaurant that has stayed around since the opening of the mall. Place has got good service and AMAZING food. Only Chinese restaurant I go to when I am in Manchester."}
{"text":"Enjoy the Dim Sum here, very friendly staff (both to us and fellow customers). Will come again!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Yang Sing or Little Yang Sing in the city centre, but having heard (and read) amazing reviews (from Yelpers and others), my husband and I thought we'd try out their location in the Trafford Centre last Sunday. I was especially excited about the prospect of Brunch-time dim sum (my most favorite and fervently missed pastime from my NYC days).  Alas, \"Meh\" perfectly describes the experience. I guess I should ask myself why I would think that Mall food would be anything better than Mall food (although I say that, and have had quite good Mall food in my hometown of SoCal-- the food court in Topanga Plaza particularly stands out). But it was just passable. We ordered a selection of dim sum  (prawn and scallop dumplings, pork buns and pork dumplings) which was okay (MRN is not a dim sum fan, but he humors me), followed by a couple of main courses (salt and pepper cuttlefish and sweet and sour sliced fillet steak), which were again, okay. They were just lacking flavor and the salt and pepper cuttlefish, lacking heat-- despite the chilies in the dish. The portion size was ample, but for the price (it's not cheap), they should be.  As for the atmosphere? Mixed-- literally. Half looked like a nice(r) Chinese restaurant, with proper tablecloths and decorative features to boot; the other half looked like-- well, a Mall food court, plastic chairs and tables and cheap linoleum. I was confused by not only the contrast but also how the host decided which section  you got to sit it. Since the place was virtually empty, I guess we weren't dressed well enough (at the MALL) to sit in the \"nice\" side.  Lesson learned: when a restaurant is recommended, go to said restaurant, not the Mall-based stepchild."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. The service was prompt even thigh it was fairly busy on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the vegan chicken in curry sauce with boiled rice. It was tasty and a decent portion. However I did find a stand of white hair in the chicken which was a disappointment."}
{"text":"We came in a big group and chose this place in the Trafford centre because it was packed. Always a good sign , so I thought. Abit pricey to be honest they had a set menu but nothing on it that was amazing in my opinion. The menu is huge! Had the war tips (pork fried dumplings) which where good but the sauce that came with them was awful it was like vinegar.. I thought it was soy and dipped the whole thing in it and immediately spit it back out. I got fried squid tenticles that where like rubber I could have bounced them off the wall and I told the waiter and he asked did I want some more? I couldn't help but laugh he just walked off and it was still on the bill at the end even when I left the full plate.. They where unedible! The Peking duck was good but nothing we haven't had before! Staff just smile and ignore you and rush you out the door by placing the bill as they lift your plates."}
{"text":"Oh Rana for once in your life.. WILL YOU PLEASE for the love of God refrain from giving full marks..for once!!!!!   Nay I say, for what shall be shall be.   On a mothering Sunday I taketh the mother bear for an evening of dining and .... well, more dining. The much visited haunts such as Rice and Tampopo were brimming full of folk passionately munching away on their spoils, which led us to a conundrum. Where to go, where to go? My last visit to Yang Sing involved not full on consumption but a mere passive eating experience when I turned up late for a meeting (resulting in finger dipping and friendly fire on plates of accommodating dinner acquaintances)  So... sensing a weakness in the queue length we parked ourselves outside the aesthetically pleasing exterior. The aromas that magic carpeted their way from the kitchen unto our nostrils did excite the rumble in the stomach jungle much, after we'd convincingly devoured the menu with our eyes.  After a 15 minute wait we were seated by the most polite gentleman ever to walk the face of Yang sing Cathay. Only a few seconds elapsed before I began waving impatiently at the nearest waiter... (My stomach now staging a full on rap battle in sound effects)   The food here was arguably the best Eastern restaurant food I have consumed.... wait for it.....*Gathers American accent momentum* Period!!!! I'm not sure whether it was the empty stomach talking or what not, but the four mains we ordered between us were healthy in proportion and delicious in content(tion?). The Beef fried rice I had were rich in texture yet not too oily....  El Madre went Chicken Kung Po on us whilst the other two mains were: shredded fillet steak with spicy yellow bean sauce and the Taiwenese sizzling chicken....  The Kung Po chicken was tender and very loving towards my tastebuds... The sizzling Taiwanese chicken thighs clothed nicely in egg fried rice went down a treat also.... However the show stealer was most definately the Shredded fillet steak... I cannot remember all the ingredients (there were red peppers) that ignited the tonguelar sensory glands ..in fact I cannot remember much aside from the intense culinary pleasure of this dish... I cannot recommend highly enough... With Mains ranging from £9-£13 you're looking at a dinner for two with drinks @ anything between £30-50 depending on the hunger scale you're operating at.. which isn't bad considering the high quality of food on offer.   Trafford Centre despite the quantity of eatery options is in fact not so varied in terms of what is on offer. Yang Sing Cathay however has at least provided another option for me aside from Tampopo, Rice and the ever present and reliable Nandos. So indulge your yin and YANG & SING and purrr like a CAT wHAYyyyyyyyy (now put the capital letters together and you've solved the puzzle for where you should dine next time you're in Trafford. Simples)"}
{"text":"I was told the place has \"improved\". It has. The rice no longer tastes of icing sugar, and there are some new menu items. I opted for the Thai Green Chicken Curry, and the vegetables and sauce were actually quite tasty...  ...alas the chicken still looks & tastes completely alien to me, the staff are rubbish and considering the quality of the food, it's very overpriced.  I still say the burrito place or the spud-u-like are better options."}
