{"text":"This place is really great if you've never eaten at an authentic taqueria.  I should have walked out when the unenthused, high-school aged employee didn't know what pastor was and stated they didn't have any. Unfortunately for me, I referred him to the list of meats on the menu. The meat was pretty bland and not even texturally like you'd find in an authentic taqueria.   The second sign that I should have just walked out was the price, $6.50 for two tacos. Taqueria tacos are supposed to be simple and cheap, $1.00-$2.50 /taco.   The third sign was when the employee asked what kind of rice I wanted on my tacos.Taqueria tacos are traditionally served with only meat, onions, cilantro, and salsa.   Despite these warnings, I went through with my purchase, and now I'm writing this review. So to make a long story short, if you want authentic taqueria style tacos, you'll have to look elsewhere. However, if you like subpar customer service with food to match, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Chicken chimichanga is do delicious and perfect! This is my fav Mexican spot in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"we were looking for a good restaurant and we're going next door when we saw this one and tried it out I was great will go back again and have recommended it a couple of Times.i didn't know they delivered."}
{"text":"Excellente taqueria! J'y retourne régulièrement. C'est vraiment bon et il y a une bonne ambiance. Vrais tacos et vraie cuisine mexicaine (ça change des autres)! Tous les amis que j'y ai emmenés ont adoré. Je recommande."}
{"text":"Reminds of places in San Diego. Thank goodness for good Mexican food. It is a can't miss place."}
{"text":"The food is great! Tons of options and all is delicious. Highly recommend the house salsa. The margaritas are great too~not too sweet. It's worth the trip. Skip the line at Chipotle and come here!"}
{"text":"My family and I have long patronized the restaurant next door -- La Fiesta -- from which this is a spin off. Both restaurants use the same ingredients, but La Taqueria is targeting a lunch crowd with its Chipotle-style line of ingredients. The decor is rather trendier than I expected given the traditional interior of the restaurant next door.  As I mentioned, La Taqueria shares ingredients with La Fiesta, which is a great boon for the new place. We have always loved the salsa and tortilla chips next door (and now here). The owner, Brian, pointed out that they have more ingredients than Chipotle, and he's right. Overall, I was impressed with the decor and the quality of the ingredients. My greatest concern for the restaurant is its location (which is difficult to spot from the road). As the restaurant is still waiting on its sign out front, things are probably moving somewhat slowly at this point, and it's too early to tell whether enough people will become aware of this place. I, however, will continue to eat at La Taqueria, and hope others will as well."}
{"text":"When I want Mexican, I go here. Hands down the best spot in Cleveland.  As a regular, I tend to get the lettuce cup tacos or a bowl as a healthy option but when I to indulge, I get the chimichanga. It's basically a fried burrito and it's phenomenal. I love the chicken tinga. If you get tacos, you can get different types of meat. And I could spend the rest of my life eating their house salsa.  For the vegetarians out there, you will not go hungry - there are lots of delicious options."}
{"text":"Best burritos in Cleveland. Everything is fresh and amazing. And the diversity of choices is mind blowing! 3 choices of rice, 3 beans, 9 types of meat, 7 kinds of peppers/onions/mushrooms, and I can't even count the amount of salsas right now. Plus a huge choice of drinks.  Also you can order from La Fiesta next door if you want. The staff is superb.  Best of all your supporting a local business that's been around since the 50's"}
{"text":"Had a chimichanga.  They offer the cross between authentic Mexican and the fast food that is so popular today.  Great ambiance and quality in each serving.   Jar riots as well as all the Mexican hot sauce choices you need!  Keep it up.  We will be back again soon"}
{"text":"My vegetarian burrito did not have any of the items listed on the menu.  No corn, no zucchini, no bell peppers!  Whattt????? Only rice, black beans,  cheese and a tortillas.   Wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, I was pleasantly surprised to find such a tasty and authentic Mexican joint with options and flavors to rival that of any madre y padre taqueria I've been to out west. Also, makes chipotle look like taco bell."}
{"text":"My favorite burrito and taco salad place!!  Just check it out. I highly recommend the chorizo and grilled zucchini and squash. Just writing this makes me want to go there for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. Even made a small chicken and rice platter for my picky pallet 11-year old   Mushrooms and red peppers a great add to the burrito."}
{"text":"An off shoot from the excellent La Fiesta next door, this faster stand and select your food is an excellent choice for top notch food.  Quality all the way and the family who owns both these restaurants are first class people."}
{"text":"People are friendly and nice, food is fast good and filling, and authentic. I've lived my whole life in Tucson Arizona and moved here to Cleveland about 4 years ago and this is the very first place where the burros and chimichangas were even close to home at all. (They are a bit different but still very good). Que Rico!!!   Thanks guys, great food, reminds me of home! Ashton was the young guy who helped me out and he was super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful Tacqueria on par with California tacquerias.   The  burritos and tostadas can be filled with an array of different preparations of beef, chicken. and pork as well as beans, sautéed veggies, mushrooms etc. The chicken mole was scrumptious...  The meats are all deliciously well seasoned as mexican fare should be.  Not a drop of grease nor is the food heavy on salt. This is my second visit here...and the quality of the food has remained consistent. Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Soo good. Lots of options for meat esters and vegetarians alike! Employees were sweet. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"A gem in the middle of strip mall suburbia. I've only gone one time b/c it's so far east, but the tacos here are top notch. the Pastor Pork is simply amazing, great spices and flavoring. They also offer chorizo, which is very good as well. A wide variety in toppings, and the big chimichanga was unique and quite good.  Not a lot of taquerias in Cleveland, so this place needs to stick around."}
{"text":"It was good. My brothers and I went after my suggestion b/c of yelp reviews. I would not go so far as to say it better than Chipotle (something about that rice) but I was happy I tried it and would go again after ohio city burrito."}
{"text":"Secret treasure.  Blink and you'll miss it, but so worth the stop. Tasty, fresh and complex. Chicken mole and pastor pork especially good. Jarritos soda too!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  This is yet another Chipotle knockoff, but it far surpasses Chipotle in taste and selection. They have an assortment of vegetables (mushrooms, zuchini, grilled onions, poblanos, etc.) To choose from as well as unique proteins such as chorizo.   They PILE ON the food, and I easily get 2 meals out of one burrito bowl."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food on the east side, and I've tried them all. Tons of option ingredients - all fresh and local. Very reasonable prices. Even the margaritas were great! I recommend the pulled port. Oh and the house salsa is the best."}
{"text":"Yesterday, March 29, 2017, my daughter and I decided we were hungry and wanted to order delivery, but we both had appetites for different foods. I chose pizza, she chose Mexican cuisine. She wanted Carne Asada fries and was able to find La Taqueria through Uber eats. I placed an order for two carne asada fries. The total came to $23, roughly, but that was including the $5 booking fee charged by the uber eats service. Delivery was prompt. Super fast, to be honest.  The carne asada fries come with the marinated grilled steak, cheese, onions, tomatoes, and guacamole. I thought sour cream was to be included, as well, but didn't detect any. These ingredients were served atop crinkle cut fries. My daughter also requested sides of jalapeños, cilantro, and extra onions, which were free of charge.   The food arrived hot, presentation was OK, but it looked appealing enough. For the price, (about $16 and some change) the portion size is perfect. Lot's of fries, a decent serving of the steak, cheese, and other items.   Now, for the taste. Both my daughter and I thought the food was really good. We tossed the jalapeños, cilantro, and onion onto the fries and loved the combination of flavors! The only complaint I have is that there were too many hard, grisly parts in the steak. I did not enjoy having to chew, only to bite down on grizzle, and have to spit it out (sorry, don't mean to be disgusting). I also wish the meat was more tender. But other than that, it was money well spent. We also received more than enough plastic forks, knives, and napkins, without having requested they be included. And the best thing about these fries were that they were awesome the next day, today! I removed the tomato and onion, placed the fries, steak, etc into an oven dish, heated on 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, took them out, placed them back into the container they arrived in, and topped with the condiments. Honestly, I think they were better today than they were when we first received them. Yum!!! So, so good!   This place gets no less than 4 stars from my daughter and I. I know, without a doubt, we'll return in the future, maybe to try some of their other menu items. The final verdict? I definitely recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Man this place is shiznit! I've been coming to this place since it first opened. The food has always been on point, fresh and very authentic overall. There are menu items you won't really find at other typical Mexican restaurants like tacos ahogados or avotacos. The staff and owners are friendly which makes me feel comfortable coming back as a customer. Although I dislike its location, it gives me a reason to even go to the mall, but it would be great if this restaurant opened other locations. As far as the food goes you can't go wrong. From the typical street tacos to the homemade rice and beans, this place is great to satisfy your Mexican food cravings. And if you're hungover, you can't go wrong with chilaquiles."}
{"text":"WOW! That was some good authentic Mexican food. The staff was friendly and the food delicious. The serving sizes are filling and I LOVE to eat! Although I was full I wanted more... You guys got me hooked. So glad a friend recommended eating there.   This place is located inside the boulevard mall food court. DONT PASS THIS PLACE UP! I am salivating like crazy just writing this :-/"}
{"text":"It's a less refined Chipotle. Food is really bland. Wish it was better. I was looking for authentic Mexican food did not find."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since my initial visit.  Killer tequila drink options, divine food.  I refer to it as the authentic, hipster Chipotle.  Having worked in a totally 100% Mexican immigrant community for 12 years, and studied and travelled extensively throughout Mexico;  this is as good as it gets... I do love all-things Chorizo (!) and their Mole is perfection.  I feel sorry for the young reviewers who stated they preferred Chipotle.  What a strong claim for the unfortunate lack of experience of the American palate...  Keep up the great work, Brian, and y'all!  And if you're lucky, you might get to meet/talk to Abuela-Fiesta!  Ask her about Michoacan!  Overall, authentically Fab!  xoxo"}
{"text":"Got the grilled chicken burrito for $7.50 and then paid two bucks extra to \"make it a chimichanga.\"  Definitely worth it. Plus so many choices to fill it with. I went with white rice, black beans, onions, sweet peppers, pico, corn salsa and chihuahua cheese. So good. Also split chips and guacamole which was also good. I would definitely recommend, but eat in if you go for the chimi style as I'm not sure if you would get the full effect if you travel. Oh and the guy who served us was super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I call this place \"top shelf chipotle\". The offerings are similar to chipotle but better, way more meat and topping offerings. Their food is amazing and the portions are huge. Every thing we have tried here is amazing. Even their chips. This place is a definite must for anyone in the area. We just wish they had later hours on weekends!!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning! Ate here Saturday afternoon and by evening, I was sick as a dog. Mind you, I'm also 5 months pregnant and ended up in the ER at midnight with horrible cramps. Ordered the taco combo and husband got the nachos. He felt nauseous as well, but luckily never got sick. I have never once got food poisoning, so I don't have a weak stomach. I eat anything and everything, but never again will I eat from here. Huge mistake, and cost me a scary ER visit with my baby, and $150 copay... which was worth it to make sure Baby was ok. Still feeling a little aches but luckily no more of the real fun symptoms."}
{"text":"I was in the mall and decided to give this place a try rather than my favorite place at the food court. Unfortunately, the burrito was just average. The texture was good and it was huge. However, it was huge because it was stuffed with a ton of rice and beans. Where was the meat? There was just a little bit of the meat, so it tasted like a vegetarian burrito. The service was good, but I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Chipotle-style fast food Mexican, where they build your order in front of you. Much MUCH better than Chipotle though: extremely wide variety of possible ingredients from a mom and pop place. I love a combo of chorizo sausage and grilled chicken. Three kinds of rice, numerous kinds of peppers, great salsa and cheeses.  I strongly recommend the chimichanga - a larger burrito that is flash fried in the kitchen, warm and crispy and delicious. I also liked the tacos platter, because you can try several different combinations of ingredients  in one meal."}
{"text":"YES!!!!!!!!! Even though I was very disappointed by La Fiesta, I love love love love La Taqueria. The choices are awesome, the food is fresh and the service is always super friendly and helpful! I've been here several times and have yet to be disappointed. There is one worker here in particular (I wish I knew his name) that is always so incredibly nice and always in such a great mood, puts you in a good mood too! I suggest trying a quesaritto, sooooo good! SO MANY MORE OPTIONS THAN CHIPOTLE!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic flavor, but in a hurry this is THE place! My personal favorites are the Carne Asada Fries and some Empanadas!  The fries are so big that it is definitely a two person job!  Everything is fresh and made to order!  Also has lots of healthy options for those of us watching our figures, so that makes it even better for me.  I feel like I get my cheat in without doing any actual damage.  Good stuff all the way around!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and bad.  The place is very, very dirty.    The food was okay.  Kind of like a cafeteria taco.   The guy making the UberEats orders wasn't wearing gloves and you could visibly see the dirt under his gross finger nails.   The light is the bathroom didn't work.   Swarms of flies around the nasty trash can.   The drink cooler is almost empty and most of the lights are off on a Saturday at noon.    I genuinely don't understand how this place got anything above a 2 star rating.  I will never come back here and wouldn't be surprised if they got a visit from the health department."}
{"text":"J'adore les tacos de la Taqueria. À petit prix, c'est un gros plus sur la rue Ontario. Ils viennent même les livrer à l'Espace Public pendant qu'on y déguste une bière."}
{"text":"Awesome place for lunch or dinner, when you don't feel like cooking! More authentic than Chipotle (and not as crazy busy either!) Very friendly & helpful staff to explain the different options.  Best part...it's delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at lafiesta for years,  I have a very short time for lunch & this is perfect. I'm in & out quickly & back at my office eating.  Prices are great.  Good quality food.  Highly recommend.  If you like it spicy try some chicken tinga"}
{"text":"Hands down the quickest and most authentic Mexican food I have ever had in the Boulevard Mall at the food court of all places!! The portions are huge and the prices are great! A wonderful gem of a place!!"}
{"text":"I eat here regularly on lunch. I don't go to chipotle anymore because this place is so much better!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, food was prepared quickly, clean environment, lots of seating inside & outside - definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Better than Chipotle. Like, a lot better.  There are so many options here and I've been pleasantly overwhelmed every time I walk in. Despite all of the options, I usually get the same thing - the grilled chicken naked bowl. I ordered the mole once, and the gentleman behind the counter warned me that it has a chocolate base and might not be what I'm looking for. I'm glad he said something! He let me try it, and it was delicious, but it definitely was not what I wanted.  They have multiple proteins, many types of cheeses and veggies, plus different herbs (like cilantro) to add. I love how customize-able everything is. Also, everyone who works there seems to love their job! They are always smiling, chatty, and helpful.  This place is becoming a regular stop for me!"}
{"text":"So I couldn't figure out why the heck two Mex places were in the same strip mall until I read the small print on the LA Taqueria door that says the place is a brainchild of its neighbor, La Fiesta.  Ah ha.  Chipotle - style ordering...read the board and tell the dude what you would like.  What you will find here is a wider range of protein options like shredded chicken mole and shredded chicken tinga as well as unique add-ons like grilled pineapple and grilled poblanos and more types of salsas.  A \"bowl\" here is literally a 9\" pie plate of food so bring your appetite.  At a little more than 7 bucks this is a great value.  No chips with your meal so boo hiss on that.  They were out of chicken mole so I was bummed but went with the chicken tinga.  Yummy.  No fish options here.   LA Taqueria is clearly the fast casual arm of LA Fiesta next door.  Don't miss their homemade house dressing for salad...it is killer good.  This place needs to stay open later.  Who closes a restaurant at 7pm on Friday and Saturday?  Oh wait, I bet they don't want to compete with the super busy, higher-ticket dinner service at LA Fiesta.  In that regard it makes good business sense but what if I have a massive craving for a grab-n-go burrito at 7:01pm on the weekend?  What's a girl to do?!  Dios mio!"}
{"text":"Montreals first authentic taqueria, no offence to Grumman '78 and their cohorts - who have great and interesting tacos, but the price is way out of line with that of street food tacos in Mexico or even sky-high priced San Francisco taquerias. This little joint, housed in a classic old Montreal hot dog diner, delivers the authentic goods, with great prices to match ($1.50-3.50 per taco, with even better combo deals). A Mexican chef, no frills decor and no pretence. Good joint to eat."}
{"text":"We had a really great meal here. Everything was fresh, the chimichanga was enough for two. So happy to find this place nearby. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE these burritos! It's exactly like chipotle, but with more authentic Mexican ingredients."}
{"text":"There is no one close to this place in terms of quality and value. The choices are extensive, the food is delicious. I strongly recommend you try this great place out. It takes minutes to get what you want."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a pleasant surprise.   The fixings for my burrito were plentiful and included in the price.  Items included queso blanco, grilled squash, three types of rice, warmed and cold salsa, crushed nacho chips and two types of onions.  Very tasty.  Very clean, no frills environment.  Very friendly staff.  I went out of my way to drive here.  Very glad I did."}
{"text":"Food was great. Lots to toppings. Prices were fair and staff friendly. Just clean the tables better. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Food was great. Folks were great. A little drafty, and restrooms could be cleaner.  Our group of four had two burritos (Pastor Pork + Steak), two sets of three tacos (Mole&pulled pork&beef + grilled steak & grilled chicken & shredded chicken), and a bowl of bean soup, plus a margarita. All delicious.   We plan to return when the weather is warmer."}
{"text":"I really want to say positive things.  I came here last year and it was amazing, but on a recent trip the other day with my mom - I was grossly unsatisfied.    Here's a positive, the staff is friendly (and has always been friendly)  But the dirty interior and swarm of bugs makes this place go way down.  The food just doesn't taste as good when you see filth around you.   Maybe thats why the only two other people that came at lunchtime ... carried out.    I used to rave about this place!!! But I'm not going to anymore.  It doesn't cost anything to clean & I just can't support a hospitality/food service business that doesn't think cleanliness is important.  If anyone has an update on this place improving hmu ... otherwise, Chili Peppers in Collinwood is a better option."}
{"text":"I have never reviewed a restaurant before, but don't want others to make the mistake we made. Overpriced, bad quality, dirty dishes to the point that we could actually scrape the filth off the rim of our glasses. Dirty restrooms. Just horrible."}
{"text":"Glad to see this place has fought through some growing pains.  Its basically a Chipotle with more options/ingredients and also lacking the stigma of it being a Chipotle. Several different salsas, peppers and toppings such as pinapple, mushrooms, etc make this a unique choice.  I also love the chicken mole option.  My only concern is that the location isn't the best, every time I've stopped in the place has been deserted. Hopefully the word of mouth continues to get out through La Fiesta."}
{"text":"A great (more delicious), local alternative to Chipotle with lot more options. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This places sucks. Wanted to try some new Mexican but this was a bad idea. Stick to Chipotle. The price doesn't beat the food. Not good at all. I would not suggest it."}
{"text":"I had their food via delivery service. The food was pretty good! I've had better in town for this type of Mexican restaurant. I ordered their wet burrito with beans and rice. The burrito and the wet sauce was a little bland for my taste but still good. (That's with having ordered mild and medium salsa)  *TO THE BUSINESS: Please improve your packaging for your food! It arrived in a complete disaster and was spilling and dripping all over the place.  A styrofoam plate with loosely covered foil wrap and a styrofoam box for a WET burrito is unacceptable for food delivery or carry out! My burrito had no sauce by the time it arrived bc it was all leaked out."}
{"text":"Super yummy food and lots of options for meat and sides. I had the naked burrito with the chicken tinga and it was awesome. Friendly staff. Was a bit difficult to get into the correct parking lot though."}
{"text":"It's not that it's bad, but for the build up...I was disappointed. Yes, there are a few more options to put on a burrito, but I didn't think the steak had the richness of flavor (and where's the beef?). I had quite a few of the toppings, but that didn't really meld into a perfect blend of flavor. You definitely get more for your money at Chipotle/Qdoba. Also, the small Golden Margarita was a big waste of change...basically ice which I polished off with several sips from a very small straw. Maybe if I had tried the jumbo...but for $15, I was scared off. Maybe this is the best in Cleveland, but I would say people here are really missing out if that's the case."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas(El Paso) right on the border, so I had a craving for some good tacos. Little did I know this place was going to become one of my favorites in Cleveland! The food was amazing! They have authentic street style tacos like back home, with tons of options for toppings. The service was great! Not to mention the hip decor of the place.   I can only imagine what the rest of the food tastes like. I highly recommend  trying this place if you are looking for some authentic, Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant here n Cleveland. I am from San Diego and this is the closest you'll ever get to the border.  Don't forget to ask for the uncles special margarita you'll only need one. I promise. Just Fabulous you'll totally enjoy the meal and at a great price."}
{"text":"The quality of this place has severely declined since the last time I was here. While the quality of the food was on par with last time - I got a naked burrito with al pastor pork - the interior of the restaurant was absolutely disgusting. The clear glass separating the guest from the build-your-own ingredients was filthy. There were fruit flies swarming the bus station and trash can area.  Finally, the staff member was completely overwhelmed, handling the entire La Taqueria side by himself. He looked miserable and the restaurant was suffering for it - I felt bad for him!  All in all, I'd maybe suggest ordering takeout. Just be wary of where the metaphorical sausage gets made."}
{"text":"got a naked burrito with the pastor pork and a bajillion toppings with the spicy guac. super delicious, and definitely could not finish it in 1 sitting, which makes it a really cheap meal. will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The steak chimichanga has entered my \"top 3\" ranking of favorite local restaurant dishes. Wish they kept later hours ... Get there before 7pm or you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Better choice than Chipotle with ALL the options!!!! Great flavor. Smaller portions now for prices than when they originally opened but still good. Our go to for a family that often wants different things!"}
{"text":"Super good real Mexican good! Great staff, very clean!  It's refreshing to get a real fast of the food from Mexico!  Came a couple of times and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Super bon et vrai mexicain, vraiment abordable! Beaucoup de choix, copieux, service très agréable et souriant Le plat de mon amie (chorizo combiné) était un peu trop salé à son goût par contre Ceci dit, à tester à tout prix!!"}
{"text":"I live not far from this restaurant and have been wanting to give it a try.  I stopped in for lunch on a Monday afternoon.   The counter staff was very welcoming as I entered the restaurant.  As everyone else has mentioned, the restaurant is set up \"Chipotle\" style, except there are lots more choices starting with entree type.   Choices range from burrito, to bowl, nachos, quesadilla, etc.   I opted for the bowl, starting with a brown rice/white rice mix.  I then added black beans.   There are loads of protein choices, larger selection than Chipotle.  I opted for the simply marinated/grilled chicken.  There were also lots of veggie options such as cabbage/cilantro, lettuce, warm zucchini, mushrooms, diced jalapenos etc.   There were also a number of  salsa and cheese choices.   The portion was more than generous and the ingredients were very fresh and well prepared.   I opted to dine-in, which offers a number of different sauces on each table.   The meal was very good and the experience less commercial, than Chipotle.   I would definitely return to LaTaqueria, and try some of the other entree options, as well."}
{"text":"Always good! Seriously, tastes like chipotle but you can fry your burrito and take it to a whole new level. It's delicious!!"}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other reviewers; this place did have its growing pains but they have really settled in.  My last 4 or 5 trips here have been excellent.  Great fast service. Fresh delicious home made ingredients.  Lots of choices. I love this joint.  Grab a quick good lunch to go or sit down with a cerveza or a margarita.  Chipotle?  Get real. No comparison."}
{"text":"Recently my wife and I tried La Taqueria out for dinner. We picked up some carry out on the way home. First off As I walked in workers were out front smoking and came walking back in when they seen a customer. My first impression is the facility was on the dirtier side and the floor really could be redone as it was in BAD shape. I got a Bowl and my wife got a burrito. I was going to get alpastor pork but after seeing it was just bits of meat sitting in what looked like water I decided to just get chicken. They have most normal items you would assume a burrito place would have. I really did enjoy the grilled pineapple option. We got a bag of chips and some salsa's and some guac to try them out. The pico was just horrible chopped up tomatoes pretty much with no flavor. The other salsa pretty much had no flavor and just a little heat and the guac was literally mashed avocado  What I did like A LOT was the mole sauce. That pretty much saved my bowl as it lacked flavor. The mole sauce is like my chipotle vinaigrette in a sense. The chips were indeed tasty. Would we go back? Possibly but I would rather have chipotle unfortunately. did not take and photos for this review"}
{"text":"Solid Taqueria in the HoMa neighborhood, I had the sope, which was made of beef broth with some chickpeas and rice. Tasty, with a tad of spicy salsa and some lime, it's a great start for a meal.  I ordered a bunch of tacos, from the chorizo taco to the pork and pineapple one. They were pretty tasty, but some of them were a bit on the ''not as warm as it could have been'' side of things. The meat was pre-cooked, however, it was also very tasty. It was extremely inexpensive, 1.50$ per tacos. The atmosphere is one of a casual taqueria, and it's an extremely efficient spot. Would recommend if you are looking for a quick bite in the area."}
{"text":"Better then Chipotle and Qdoba. The workers are nice and like doing there job. This place is hidden so you can by pass it very easy. I been living near this place for 6 years never knew it existed. You can sit down and eat or just order to go. The food is really good and I don't have any complaints. Come check these guys out you won't go wrong with LA Taqueria."}
{"text":"Tried out this place using uber eats. Ordered carne asada fries, 2 tacos and a taco salad. Everything was pretty good until I found a hair in my fries. Tossing entire order. Do not eat here. Also notified uber eats"}
{"text":"You guys!  I found a delicious burrito east of the Mississippi and I'm so excited.  I tried this place based on the Yelp reviews, and was not disappointed.   To me it seemed like an authentic version of Chipotle, but with way more options-- things like pastor pork, chicken mole, and chorizo.  They have burritos, tacos, tostadas, and more.  I ordered a pork burrito with cilantro lime rice, onions & poblanos, queso, corn salsa, and pastor salsa.  The rice was a bit overcooked/soft for my taste, but the rest of it was fabulous-- the pork was especially good.  The menu is super customizable so you could try a lot of different combinations and never be bored.  Everything is under $10 (except for guacamole being extra) so it's very reasonable too.  They mentioned to me that they're starting up a food truck, so keep an eye out for that.  I'm sure I'll be back because I'd love to try more of the meats, the mole salsa, the guacamole, and oh-- the California burrito (fries instead of rice?!).  Apparently, it's been around for forever, and for good reason."}
{"text":"Similar to Chipotle, but leans slightly more on the authentic side. La Taqueria has a bit more variety on their menu. It is owned by the same family who runs La Fiesta, which claims to be the first Mexican restaurant in CLE. Both are located practically next to each other. Many choices, good ingredients, good food! I've tried their chorizo and pastor pork burritos. Excellent! Oh, and make sure to upgrade your burrito to a chimichanga! They'll flash deep fry your burrito - giving it that awesome crispy texture to the tortilla. The great thing is that your burrito does NOT get oil-logged. If you're in the area, make it a point to try this joint."}
{"text":"This place is exquisite. Normally I wouldn't expect much from a restaurant in the mall, but La Taqueria is full of flavor. The food is fresh and tastes like a lovingly prepared homemade cooked meal.  Items on the menu include the very traditional sopas, empanadas, enchiladas; there are also original items like the avotacos. The food is seasoned with signature sauces that you won't find anywhere else. La Taqueria introduces large traditional Jalisco meals at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The owner was very courteous and took the time to explain the different taco options. It was the first authentic Mexican taqueria I have been to in Montreal and would definitely recommend to visitors and locals!"}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a friend I got the La Taqueria taco truck for my birthday party...so glad I did! Everything was so delicious and everyone loved it! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and burritos. Very fresh ingredients all across the board. Staff is great and friendly! Feel much better about spending my money there than at a Chipotle that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Yep.  Delicious with better flavor than Chipotle or Qdoba.  Customer service is wonderful, too."}
{"text":"I had the chicken wet burrito!!!! Talk about flavor!!! The best tasting chicken and wet burrito ive had in vegas!!! Must try it"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch! LOTS of fresh choices to build your own burrito or tacos. Sooo good. Wish they had one in KC."}
{"text":"Food wasn't warm and was a bit disappointing. The burrito wasn't very good. The spicy guacamole was good, but overall I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"What a change from my first visit. Filthy. Sticky, unwashed tables and seats. The chalk ledge at the board hadn't been cleaned in ages. The chorizo was barely warm. Didn't have lime/cilantro rice prepared. I could go on."}
{"text":"Great idea....poor execution.  I had a coupon, for free chips and salsa with a taco and soda. Never tried this, but we are long time customers of La Fiesta (the mother store, next door) which is IMHO the best Mexican food in Cleveland. So I figured this had to be good. We LOVE the tacos at La Fiesta.  It's an attempt as others mention here to have a Chipolte-like quick lunch spot (or late night spot maybe). I am sure the owners figured that they had vastly superior and more authentic ingredients than Chipolte, so why not outdo them?  Well...it was a great idea. I arrived at 11:30, the time they were to open. Nothing was ready. The sole clerk said \"come back in half an hour\". Fine, but then don't post an opening time of 11:30AM! I did come back, and the place was empty. I ordered 2 tacos, a soda and my free chips.  BIG PROBLEM. The toppings look fine (seeming identical to La Fiesta; they share a kitchen) but the taco SHELLS were supermarket corn tortillas -- cold. Ice cold, uncooked (not even microwaved) and stored in a plastic tub. They were awful, and just RUINED the tacos. Who eats ice cold, damp, uncooked corn tortillas? Nobody, that's who.   I wish I could say \"it was an untrained clerk, who had no idea how to make a taco\" but the young man introduced himself as a family member, and even recognized me from my many visits to the original restaurant. I am baffled why he thought using cold uncooked tortillas made any sense. It was unappetizing, chilled the fillings, AND they broke apart. He also put two under each filling, saying \"you can use the extras to scoop up anything that falls out\".  On top of this, he charged me for the free chips, apparently forgetting the coupon or unable to figure out how to take it off the bill.  Folks: nobody is going to spend $6 on a cold corn tortilla, no matter what the fillings are. Also, the room is dark and depressing and uncomfortable. This has a long, long way to go before the format (which is a good basic idea) works."}
{"text":"Though quality of the tacos is average at best, the atmosphere, value and service are great.  I went in for lunch and got their 4 taco and soupe combo for 8.60 + tax. Each taco individually is 1.75, and three tacos here is enough food for lunch, so you can get a pretty cheap meal for around 6 dollars. The man helping me was very kind and gave off a very welcoming vibe.  Soup: Was okay, fairly bland (rice + chickpeas) Ground beef: Seasoned well but oversalted The other tacos I tried all suffered from the same issue of being underseasoned and dry. (carnitas, sausage, steak)   Overall a decent place if you're in the neighborhood and want something cheap to eat but not mind blowing."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. I went here after I missed the yelp happy hour event. I think this place is like an authentic version of chipotle.  I ordered a burrito and it starts like chipotle with the simple option of rice -brown, white, or spanish- then there's 3 kinds of beans as well. That's where the similarities with chipotle ends.   There are so many options that ordering a burrito should just be skipped. I would just go withe the taco salad so you can just load up on all the options (I'm greedy that way).  I would have liked a tofu option but I'll live.  Side note: they recycle"}
{"text":"This place is attached to a larger restaurant. I agree with the other comments that it's a nice change up to Chipotle, but I wish their ingredients were fresher. If you are going to do a sit down meal, I would advise going next door."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place considering the reviews and my love for Chipotle and Qdoba. First of all, the staff is amazing. Really friendly and helpful.   But the food. Plenty of options, but not plenty of flavor. I tried two kinds of chicken and both were bland. The salsas were watery and didn't provide the bite or heat I expected.  I love the idea of the menu, but was not a fan of the execution. I really expected some bold flavors and combinations, but left disappointed. Maybe it was just a bad day for the kitchen... But it wasn't enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious! We stopped in on a whim and we're happily surprised! It is a small place, which is a build-your-own burrito/taco/etc partner with La Fiesta next door. Everything is homemade and the ingredients are local. Great flavors! I got chorizo and my girlfriend got chicken. Both amazing. The grilled onions and squash are delicious, as is the Queso. Service was friendly, prices were on point."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has either gone south since these great reviews or we caught it on the worst possible day. The kids that were working there were closing up at 6:30, I think it said they closed at 7. Our burrito was topped with liquid sour cream which soaked the whole thing and made it impossible to eat. Tacos a la carte were super small and not a good value. Nothing was really \"good\" about the whole meal. They have tons of different sodas which was fun. All in all, one of the few places I would never go again."}
{"text":"Amazing. Some of the best food I've had in the area. Get a chimichanga; they are unbelievable. Very friendly and knowledgable staff. They make wonderful recommendations."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here tonight to try for the first time. Very dirty inside the one booth had  someone's shoes and coat and and garbage in it. The food didn't look good either. It looked like it had been sitting out. The beans and mole a sauce was very crusty in the container it was sitting in. The guy helping us in the middle of Greening us decided to take off the shirt that he had on to wear the T-shirt he had on underneath very unprofessional. We definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Great carne asada quesadillas. Food is always made fresh. Staff is very friendly and they have yet to get my order wrong. Not crazy about the location but food is well worth it."}
{"text":"So, so good. Great authentic Mexican cuisine. Clean facility. Very good experience! Great job Brian Atkins & family!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So many choices to customize your order. Much better than Chipotle and the rest of the fast casual Mexican restaurants. Excellent customer service as well. Definitely check it out! Yum..."}
{"text":"Seen this place was new on Grubhub saw they had Carne asada fries and Nachos so we figured we'd give it a shot. The nachos were ok. I mean the topping were good, the meat was tender and flavorful, but the chips were kind of chewy. The same with the fries all was good but the fries could have cooked longer. Will definitely order again. Next time we'll try the tacos and burritos"}
{"text":"My second visit to this little hidden mexican food outlet within a mall.  This time I ordered the  Carne asada burrito.  Beef, rice beans, pico, guaq, mild salsa, garnished with some fresh squeezed lime for each bite.  All I have to say is WTF, why is this place in a mall.  The food is awesome.  From what I have ordered there has always been a balance of fresh flavors.  You guys rock, I will return to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"A must try for anyone who likes authentic Mexican. Order and prepared similar to chipotle but very authentic with a small diner feel. Fantastic"}
{"text":"I was so glad to see this place open next to La Fiesta.  They make your taco in front of you to order like Chipotle or Qdoba, but at Taqueria they have far superior ingredients and a huge selection of fillings and toppings.  Their quesadilla takes it to a whole new level.  Service is great and they actually smile"}
{"text":"Went for lunch at work. Seating for large groups isn't great but the food was awesome and it was a really chill/cool atmosphere. Better than Chipotle. So happy I found it and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Définitivement ce qu'une taqueria devrait être. Excellente nourriture pour un excellent prix. Sans aucun doute meilleure que toute les taquerias que j'ai connu en Europe, et aussi bonne que celles que j'ai eu la chance de goûter aux États-Unis.  Le décor rend le restaurant charmant. L'édifice est un ancien stand à patates frites sur la colorée Ontario. La décoration est très minimaliste, avec chaises en plastique, nappes de plastique, et banderoles mexicaines. Les employés sont vraiment chouettes et la cuisine, qui prend la moitié de la bâtisse, est propre et à aire ouverte.  J'espère que ça deviendra une institution de la rue Ontario. Si vous hésitez pour une soirée au restaurant, je conseille vivement La Taqueria, quitte à aller prendre un verre aux alentours pour un décor plus \"cozy\". Définitivement un incontournable!!  Seul bémol: la télévision qui sert d'ambiance, sur laquelle on passe les nouvelles de Danny Turcotte. S'il-vous-plaît..."}
{"text":"Chipotle style restaurant with 100 more local fresh farm ingredients.  Great service. They are not your typical Mexican restaurant when it comes to service. Everyone was courteous and very friendly.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Yummy authentic quick mexican food!  This place is much better than Chipotle and the workers were fun and friendly.  There is a lot more options than Chipotle.  I had a rice bowl with mexican rice and it was super good!  If you're by the area and looking for a quick meal definitely try out La Taqueria!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the naked burrito, which is basically a \"build it yourself\"burrito in a dish, a large dish. Mine started out with cilantro rice chorizo and grilled chicken. This was the first time ever that a restaurant offered cabbage instead of lettuce. Loved it. I also selected three or four sides but they have a large selection from which to choose. I went for mild. The Jarritos lime soda to wash it down was tasty too. My meal was huge for me and only cost $6.00 greenbacks and some change."}
{"text":"Great build your own tacos! The chorizo is amazing! The staff was super friendly too. There are a ton of options to choose from. We drove across town to check this place out and were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Similar choose your own setup to Chipotle, with fresh ingredients, many more options to select from, and a more authentic feel.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super place dans Hochelaga pour manger de la bouffe VRMT mexicaine! Le menu est petit, mais parfait puisque tout est bon!! Les prix sont ridiculement petits, tu en as pour ton argent! Nous avons goûté les 4 sortes de tacos, excellents! Coup de coeur pour celui au porc effiloché! MIAM !! Nous avons aussi adoré les nachos à la viande!! Délicieux!  Vraiment je vous le suggère! En plus, si jamais tu veux d'la bonne bière et une bonne ambiance, rends-toi à l'Espace Public et commande à partir de là! Ils ont une collabo !!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything I get from here is so flavorful and good. Their salsa is great would highly recommend if you live in the east side."}
{"text":"There are two things I look for when walking into a new restaurant: is it clean and are the people friendly?   La Taqueria surpassed all the requirements with flying colors. Coolly decorated, clean and super friendly staff already gives them 2 stars out the gate!  The other two stars are for the great food. I'm a taco lover (giggity) and I'm talking about REAL tacos, not that yellow shell BS (even though, those are tasty too, lol). I bought 3 tacos, 2 pulled pork, 1 shredded beef. I added a few toppings (cheese, sour cream, corn, lettuce) and bought chips and spicy guac.  The food was pretty yummy! Out of the two meats I chose, I enjoyed the beef more. Really flavorful, not fatty and just all around delish. Next time, I will be buying a burrito.  As for the spicy quac - I took a chip, dipped it and popped it into my mouth. For a split second I thought, \"Spicy my ass\", until my taste buds rang the alarm. HOLY $#!T is it HAWT!! This ain't yo granddaddy's guacamole.  It's a super creamy texture, like a paste so it was a tad bit weird as I am used to eating and making chunky. Nonetheless, it was good. If you're not a fan of your tongue literally being on fire - avoid.  Overall, I enjoyed my visit and will return."}
{"text":"Wow.  Amazing.  We needed a quick place to grab carry-out after a movie tonight and this was near the theater. We ordered chimichangas, a quesarito and tacos. They had it ready in 15 minutes and they were so kind that they actually apologized that they were still bagging it up when I arrived. They were actually faster than we expected they would be and this was while they were busy with other customers. The staff was wonderful.  Everything was excellent. The food is delicious. The service was perfect. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough meat in our meals, but everything tasted so good that I almost stopped caring.  I'm going to be craving La Taqueria until we can go back for more."}
{"text":"Terrible they forgot part of my order and what they did bring tasted like it had been made a week ago and put  in the microwave it was still cold in the middle I would never order from here again"}
{"text":"Great casual Mexican fare. In a custom order line, you order tacos or burritos with really fresh ingredients. The chimichanga which is a deep fried burrito is perfectly fried -not greasy at all, the tortilla takes on a flaky crispiness that speaks to very hot oil in the common kitchen shared with the sit down restaurant La Fiesta. Service was excellent. Am glad to have found this place."}
{"text":"La Taqueria is located in the food court of the Boulevard Mall.  It may never rate a Michelin star, but it far surpassed what I would have expected from food court fair.  Most fast food Mexican restaurant give you a choice of hard or soft taco shells.  If it's a slightly better place they might even give you the option of flour or corn tortillas.  La Taqueria takes things just one step farther, offering you the option to eat your tacos on lettuce shells.  This is fantastic news for those who've chosen to go gluten free.  For me, it was just a very healthy and very tasty option that elevated my simple order of tacos with carnitas into something a little more special.   I ordered a plate of 3 lettuce tacos, each of which came on a very large leaf of what appeared to be romaine lettuce.  The lettuce was crisp and fresh, and was showing no signs of having been out of the cooler before my tacos were made.  I headed over to the salsa bar which had three different kinds of salsa and a variety of other veggies.  There was a mild red, medium red, and a green salsa.  There were chopped onions, chopped cilantro, sliced limes, whole radished, pickled jalapeno slices, and some kind of pickled onion or radish to choose from.  I loaded up my tacos with fresh condiments and headed for the tables to try them out.  Mmmmm.... Cool Crispy crunchy lettuce, warm tender moist carnitas, spicy salsa, juicy pico de gallo... These were damn good tacos for a food court.  I must admit the atmosphere is standard food court with a sterile feel and completely lacking in any character, but the food makes up for it in spades.  It was a fresh and tasty lunch that felt pretty healthy compared to some of the other stuff we ate in Vegas and I left feeling pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"Ok food.  Everytime I get a bowl I always feel it's missing something.  It's a great change up from Chipotle. They have a much better selection and they have some really unique items. I'm not one for fried food, but they can fry their burritos which my friends said was awesome!"}
{"text":"Food is good fresh service is ok drinks are sammy but good. Mole is really good for ohio. I would come back for sure"}
{"text":"Food was good... we ate on the side set up like Chipotle. More menu options then i expected but compared to the taco-burrito-salad options at other places. Decor was dated and to me just had a im clean but not type of feel...if ever needing a reason to goto the richmond mall again we may stop in for lunch."}
{"text":"Best Mecican food since Texas! I miss Texas and all the food I can eat. But here it is really authentic."}
{"text":"Where do I start?.... I'm from Arizona, and was craving some real Mexican food. This place was rated the best, so here I am. Unclean. Food looks old, my burrito wasn't rolled correctly and was a sloppy mess. the kid behind the counter was clueless and new. The lady in the kitchen was wrangling up her crying toddler in the lobby and then taking him back in to the kitchen.... which I can only assume is set up like a makeshift daycare full of dirty diapers and whatever else. Then the guy eating his lunch cane behind the counter to ring me up. Needless to say, the cleanliness and service were a complete joke. I drove all the way across town to come here, and I am completely disappointed. I took two bites of my burrito and threw it in the garbage for fear of getting sick.  If I could give it 0 stars I would. I am never never never coming back here."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch or casual dinner.  Fantastic value... a better local version of Chipotle that offers great quality and better choice for Mexican build-your-own concept.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Mexican food. Blows chipotle out of the water and I love chipotle. I had the chimichangas and they were so damn good. My girlfriend got hers with fries inside. Great atmosphere. great soda selection. Even greater selection on the fixing to put in your boritos & bowls. I would highly recommend anyone in the area check this place out."}
{"text":"We loves this place - beats Barrio any day. When you walk in you might not be impressed but wait until you try the food"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely horrible. I got a bean and cheese burrito that was completely oily and a taco that looks disgusting. I was missing items including the sauce that goes on my Burrito as well as sour cream and guacamole that I paid extra for. My food is also very cold."}
{"text":"Excellent local take on fast casual Mexican cuisine. Their food is simply fantastic! Many more options than chipotle or similar places. Queso fresco, mole salsa, chorizo, chipotle sauces and more. Priced the same as national chains but locally owned. If you are in the neighborhood stop by and try them out. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We found this place for a quick lunch using Yelp on a visit to the area.  The 4 of us all tried different things ranging from a very plain cheese quesadilla for my daughter to a naked burrito with chicken mole, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, Spanish rice, black beans, lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole and sour cream for me.  Everyone loved the food and we really enjoyed the wide range of choices.  The Mexican sodas were a nice touch.  We were served by two very helpful young men who guided us through the order process and made some great recommendations.  I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the floor was pretty dirty on the day we went.  My sneakers were sticking to the floor in one spot."}
{"text":"This is way better than chipotle food is amazing here I saw all the good reviews on here so I decided to check it out and that was a good decision. The staff is amazing you get your money's worth in food and it has a better selection and more to choose than chipotle it's has he same theme as the line you go down and get what you want but way more options. It is a must try I guarantee you'll be back I've ate here 3 :days  in a row getting the bowl first then the burrito and yesterday I had the nachos not one complaint about one I had the chicken mole' and steak in my last 2 entrees but the first one I had the grilled chicken I like the chicken mole better but both elders a great taste the mole' is drenched in a chocolate peanut sauce (yeah nasty at first thought) but was unexpectedly a great taste and choice I will be back some time this week to try the tacos maybe the staff of very friendly and will let you taste everything before you buy it so be sure to. If you like Mexican food this is the best I find around in the Cleveland area ."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff!!, nice authentic decor.  Young hipsters in their twenties keep me feeling young myself.  The grilled pineapple was a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"The good: I thought it was going to be just a Mexican carryout, but they have several booths and a nice atmosphere, and funky Mexican music. My husband got the chorizo burrito and raved about it.   The bad: I made the mistake of getting a vegetarian chimichanga. They completely forgot about it, so we sat and waited over 20 minutes. They apologized and took it off the bill, but c'mon....we're the only people in the place! I understand we were there at closing, but sheesh. They couldn't figure out how to refund it off our card so we got cash back.  Now I will say that after finally getting home with my chimichanga, I found it delicious and big. They fold it and cut it so it can be eaten without utensils, which is handy (pun intended!) So I will give this place another shot and hopefully the food will be as good and the service will be much quicker."}
{"text":"Got the quesadilla with mole chicken, grilled peppers, onions, and pineapple. Delicious. I would definitely return. Much better than chipotle."}
{"text":"Awesome good authentic food. Better than the rest of the fake Mexican food here in vegas. The enchiladas fish tacos chicken salad a d tacos... just everything...yum! Staff is always super friendly too. My go to!"}
{"text":"Delicious little joint that offers cheap mexican eats! La Taqueria doesn't look like much from the outside, or inside,  but the food is good, the ingredients are simple and everything is fresh.  Staff was also very friendly and patient when we were trying to figure out what to order. The chefs are mexican and I suppose it's a good sign when you hear about other Mexicans who enjoy this place too.  For a 1.75$ a taco, you can try every variety and the portions are actually decent, I was surprised at how much meat went into each one.  I would definiately recommend this place for a quick lunch, or for take out. They partner with Foodora and Just Eat as well as a bar down the street called Espace Public.  Check it out, it's probably one of my favorite spots in this neighborhood now!"}
{"text":"I will never go to chipotle again!!! Love this place the prices are reasonable and you have so many options. If you're worried about calories than this may not be the place for you but this could be an epic cheat meal!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing doesn't do La Taqueria justice. The food is simply amazing. Fresh ingredients, great variety at an affordable price. Say no to corporate Mexican burrito joints and yes to La Taqueria. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Excellent Tacos, Salads and everything in between! Fast and made to order! (not like some others who come in already half cooked) Love it! If you can... if you see them parked somewhere STOP and try'em!"}
{"text":"I remember going here with my mom sometime last year. I don't remember exactly what I got, but I DO remember that it was fresh and very delicious. I will update this review after the next time I go."}
{"text":"The place was filthy.Wasn't busy but all the tables where dirty.Won't even discribe the bathroom, but you can smell it before you get there. There was a lady behind the counter sticking her bare hands in the food eating it.Our food was cold.The only toppings I was offered for my tacos was onions and cilantro, apparently cheese, sour cream that normally comes with tacos every where else was extra cost here.My boyfriend got some veggie thing that was like soup, and cold.Even IF the food is good here and we just came on an off day, the mess and filth of this place is a big NO."}
{"text":"This is a \"street food\" style mexican restaurant ala qdoba or chipotle but the food is much better. Very good quality and though the menu is simplified they will actually make you things that are not on the menu since they are attached to La Fiesta which they share a kitchen with.  The service is good, the restrooms are clean and it's one of our favorite quick-to-go restaurants."}
{"text":"I have 2 things to address 1) The \"build your own burrito\" was super tasty and had options you wouldn't find at Chipotle 2) however, when I went to dump my plate in the garbage there was a tub of dirty dishes on top that had maybe 100 flies all over them (not even an exaggeration) and now I'm super disgusted."}
{"text":"We went here because it was 'nearby' after grocery shopping at the Whole Foods. We were more expecting an actual taqueria then a spin off of the Chipotle line-up-and-make-a-burrito thing. There is nothing wrong with that in practice, we were just a bit surprised.  Both my sister and I really enjoyed the burritos we did make, and the guy behind the counter was really friendly and helpful. I ended up with the chicken mole and my sister had a spicy version of chicken that I can't quite remember.  I took stars off because I got the salad burrito and I was under the impression that it was essentially the stuff you put in a burrito, but on a salad. It was not. It was simply more lettuce inside a burrito. I'm on a pretty strict diet and that annoyed me. Additionally, the lettuce must have come out of a very cold fridge or freezer because it dropped the temperature of the burrito to near-chilly. I dislike having meat that's supposed to be hot end up cold, and that is what tipped me into the category of \"I don't think I'll go here again\".   But it was nice to finally have some 'Mexican' food!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say something good about this place but sadly I'll never get to know if the food is any good because of the cashiers horrible attitude. God forbid if you have any questions about how the food is served or special request to have the taco toppings placed on the side. All your questions get you is attitude and a sense that they want nothing to do with answering your questions let alone serve you. I've never seen such a small mom and pop shop with poor customer service considering they depend on your business to remain open. All I wanted was 2 avotacos with the lettuce, cream and cheese on the side. They made me feel like I was asking for a million dollars. I'll probably try again earlier in the day when you can expect people to have a decent, welcoming attitude."}
{"text":"this place is ok - but i probably won't revisit. the tacos were ok but i prefer other places like restaurant mais (even if they are less \"authentic\") and tacos victor (authentic as well). the biggest positives: (i) i liked their tortilla chips with cheese, salsa, and sour cream (unfortunately, the had run out of guacamole) and (ii) their items are quite inexpensive. the biggest negative: the place wasn't very clean. i had to use my son's baby wipes to clean the table we ate at."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch and let me tell you...this place is BOMB.COM. I got a burrito bowl with lime cilantro rice, steak, mole, queso fresco, sautéed peppers, onions, and crimini and shitake mushrooms, chopped cilantro, corn salsa and fresh Pico de Gallo. And it was awesome. This places takes the best aspects of Chipotle and Qdoba and combines them and adds a dose of authentic and fresh ingredients and more choices. Best fast casual burrito I've had in cleveland, I'll be going here regularly."}
{"text":"Just the best fast casual Mexican option. Its delicious! Everyone should try this. You will never go to chipotle or qdoba again."}
{"text":"I order for delivery from this place all the time I just moved out here from SoCal and was having trouble finding decent street tacos but this place is my absolute favorite so far! Completely addicted to the food here you won't be dissapointed!"}
