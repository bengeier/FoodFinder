{"text":"I find this place to be delightful and reasonably priced for the generous portions that you get when you're done here.  Everything on the menu is delicious especially the lamb chop dinner and a tiger shrimp dinner is also very good.  The seating is inside a little bit small but very cozy and if you recommend take the time to sit down and have a dinner here or get a take out if you choose.  This is one of the best Greek restaurants I've ever had better than the ones on the Danforth and the price you cannot beat!"}
{"text":"I was feeling homesick for Greek food.  The reviews on Yelp made this place sound much better than it was.  It was a rundown, greasy spoon type of diner, that had a Greek theme.  The portions were fine, but made up of 90% rice.  The food was mediocre.  The prices were far too much, considering the quality and ambience of the place.  The bathrooms smelled terrible too."}
{"text":"Authentic family-owned Greek restaurant in The Beach. Large portions, well priced and always fresh. The chicken souvlaki was tender, and fresh off the grill. The Greek 'side' salad was actually big enough for two. I hear the mousaka is a must-have - I'll save that for next time. Good for take-out or eat-in."}
{"text":"Jim and his wife are super nice. They catered for our son's baptism one Sunday and the food was awesome. It was during the ice storm and they gave us a good price and opened up early for us. Did I mention the food was awesome? Half the party of 18 didn't show up, due to the weather, but the food was still all gone by the end of the night."}
{"text":"My partner and I have enjoyed dinner here many times, and have always been very happy with the food, service, and overall experience. The affordable menu entices us to dine here on impulse when we just don't feel like cooking--the value is unbeatable. Tinos's consistency and attention to detail are high; I often leave the rice on my plate at a Greek restaurant, because I consider it a \"filler,\" but the rice at Tinos is too delicious not to eat. I agree with other reviewers who favour Tinos over places on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Walked into this place on Thursday, it's a small diner looks like any greasy spoon joint.  Sat down with my friend and ordered the Octopus, which was good and I ordered the Spanokopitas while my friend ordered the Gyro dinner as the main entrees.  The Spanokopitas was microwaved and tasteless, but the Gyros meat was prepackaged and definitely microwaved as the thin pieces of meat was like eating a chewy potato chip and the rice was hard and crunchy in places on the plate.  I went to this place on on other reviewers recommendations, and was quite shocked with the food quality.  I think they should stick to souvlakis as from what the reviewers are ordering it must be the best they have on menu,"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the beaches! The owners are really nice too.   It would be nice if they were open for lunch more often."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here several times. The food and service have always been terrific. Great prices, warm atmosphere, friendly service."}
{"text":"This is the quality of Greek food that I want on the Danforth but can almost never find.   I've now been twice and, both times, ordered the pork souvlaki dinner ($12). The pita is warm, crispy, and chewy. Tzatziki is just tart enough. Fresh Greek salad takes up half the plate, and there are generous helpings of (boiled?) potato and rice to go with it. The actual chunks of souvlaki aren't huge, but still good, bite-sized, and definitely juicy (dry meat need not apply).  A fantastic meal and friendly service twice in a row now. I'll be heading back."}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant with heavenly baklava.   Down-to-earth Greek fare and a relatively hidden gem amongst the Beaches many restaurants.   Also, amazing service."}
{"text":"Closed!!!!! Turning into burger joint , read so many great reviews in this place thought I check it out for my first date before , put address in GPS and drove down but it took  Me to a burger joint not open yet, I called the number and message said they are now a burger joint, or will be soon"}
{"text":"Delightful family owned/operated Greek restaurant. Excellent food, enormous portions, reasonable prices, great service, congenial and attentive service."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I always order the chicken souvlaki dinner, and it's always amazing! The owners are a treat to deal with, and always smiling. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and great customer service."}
{"text":"What a find! Thanks Yelp for alerting us to this little gem at the east end of The Beach.  Food is the star here, lovingly prepared by chef/owner Jim. It's a family affair with his wife and mother helping out.  Everything is fresh and beautifully prepared and presented. Was so amazed at the rich red tomatoes in the salad in the middle of winter! Was pleasantly surprised at the wine selection as well.  I'll be back, again and again!"}
{"text":"As far as Greek food goes, this is up with the best i've had! Family owned and they are always consistent! Have eaten here a lot of times and never had a bad meal. I usually order the chicken souvlaki dinners.  Costs $13 plus tax, and very generous portion sizes. Comes with lemon potatoes (wish I could make them the same) a nice amount of chicken, always cooked perfectly. Rice, Pita bread and greek salad. This place never disappoints and everything is super fresh. Love it."}
{"text":"The best Greek food I have ever eaten even compared to Greece. This place is a real gem. Everything is cooked from scratch to absolute perfection. Off the beaten path from the danforth but definitely worth the visit.  Nothing was greasy, everything was fresh and flavorful. I want to return again and again and again! Prices very reasonable for generous portions of food."}
{"text":"The food is FANTASTIC! I´m always shocked that each I go there, there isn´t a queue leading a mile out the door."}
