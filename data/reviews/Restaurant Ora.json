{"text":"I used to be sold to Ora. Great food, great vibe, excellent service. However I just have experienced the worst service ever in a restaurant in my life, and I do not recommend this place to anyone.

We waited for 50 minutes to get a table, with a reservation!
We then waited at least 40 minutes to get water. 
No service, no waitress, nothing. And no one seemed to care.

The place is overcrowded, the music is too loud and its full of douchebags and bimbo with fake boobs.

The service is terrible, no one knows what they are doing, or where to go.

I will not go again. It is a terrible place"}
{"text":"walked in here for a minute after leaving tribe

some seriously crazy party inside, girls dancing on tables, champagne down their throats, men hugging eachother (or maybe just holding eachother up? who knows), french disco house pumping 

wish i stayed :( :( :("}
{"text":"My fiancee and I stumbled onto this place late night in Montreal, while we were actually looking for a different restaurant. However we liked the menu and decided to give it a try. SO glad we did! The food was excellent, reasonably priced (depending on how many dishes you order, naturally), and our waiter was great. He was very attentive, fast, and gave solid suggestions (and some free appetizers yay). I would definitely recommend this place in a heartbeat. It looks trendy on the outside, but is very laid back and friendly inside. We're from New York so we're used to posh-looking places that have a lot of unnecessary attitude, and I was glad this wasn't the case here. It's also quite amusing to watch the club goers line up next door at Tribe.."}
