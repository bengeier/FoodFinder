{"text":"Had the tilapia. Tasted like perch. I liked this place much better when it was Paul's. Its still better than Pete's down the street"}
{"text":"Wonderful family restaurant. Homemade food was very good. Looked more like a Denny or kings restaurant, but the food was much better. Big tables, large portions."}
{"text":"Wife and I had a good meal here.  Pleasantly surprised at good food, large portions and low prices.  Not gourmet dining, but good lunch fare.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal. Good, fresh food. I had the salmon dinner with my choice of potatoes and vegetable along with a soup. Fresh coffee, good desserts and great, consistent service! Let me not forget to mention the good sized portions!  Try the chicken paprikash, cobb salad, skillet breakfast, any omelette and/or the monster burger!"}
{"text":"This diner is in walking distance from where my boyfriend lives and well to prove my laziness we drove. The parking lot made us assume it was packed but once we got inside there were still a decent amount of places to sit. You grab your own menus and sit wherever you like. 

This is a true diner as the only computer system is to swipe credit cards. The servers write down everything and the kitchen uses an order wheel for all orders. I ordered the  Country Skillet that included sausage, bacon, onions, hash browns, 2 eggs cooked to order and a lot of cheese (which I like) and 2 pieces of toast. It pretty much was a delicious mess plate! I don't know what kind of sausage they used but it was much better than the brown sausage links I am used to seeing in diners. My boyfriend ordered the Gyro Omelette. The weird thing about this omelette is that it only includes the gyro meat and feta. He had to ask for tomato, onion and cucumber sauce. It must have been good though because he ate the whole thing. 

The only thing diners should be cautious about when eating here is that the coffee was one of the worst that we have tasted and at $2 it's $2 a cup to boot. Opt for a different beverage because other than that the menu is large and the food is good!"}
{"text":"So the town is a little space when it comes to breakfast dinners.  The place itself is old, but cool inside.  The service is great.  The coffee cups are a little small.

So why a 3.  Hay, 3 is A OK, which is what this place is.  The pancakes were great, the corned beef hash is from a can, okay, but not homemade which is what I would expect.  Eggs and bacon were cooked per order.

Upside is you can order much and diner items in the AM as well.  We did joy but table next to us did.

So bottoms line, food was okay, service and price were great.  Facility was funky but present.  Worth a shot."}
{"text":"Food was fair but lightly poached eggs were almost hard boiled.  And the waitress was less than friendly.  Perhaps it is because we aren't from the area.Don't try to change the order from either pancakes or french toast to just plain toast or the waitress will almost bite your head off with a stern NO."}
{"text":"First time to Chris' restaurant. My perch dinner was very good. Vegetable soup was really good. Coleslaw was good. Chris' has been there over 40 yrs.  Some brand new cushioned benches  would really make a wonderful PLUS to Chris'. Then, customers could really enjoy their food, in COMFORT.  #pleasemakerenovation"}
{"text":"Nothing was homemade, although I heard there are some homemade items. Pierogies were mrs ts! get those koc 'rogies shipped in! Service was friendly! Christine is a nice independent woman! #nohillbilly. Napkins were on point, water glasses a little small #tinycups. Lunch menu was ehhhh, breakfast is probably more worth it. We didn't overall like what they served us. Take care"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot that I've been coming to since I was a little kid. They have the best food and such a friendly staff. We came for breakfast and our food came out within 5 minutes of ordering it! I love love coming here and have the best memories eating here as a kid. We would always come to Chris' restaurant after church. They are always so busy and you know that's when it's really good. They've been open forever and I'm so happy I can come here when I visit my parents in Lorain.

The inside is very clean and cozy. It hasn't changed in so many years and that's what I love about it. I had the veggie omelette with home fries and it was so good. You also can't beat the price. For my mom and I to have breakfast it was only $10! Everything is home made and fresh. It's like grandma's cooking. :) They also have specials certain days of the week that include chicken paprikash and cabbage rolls. I would highly recommend coming here for breakfast - you definitely won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"We stopped on Super Bowl Sunday evening and enjoyed the delicious Chicken Paprikas and a burger with home fries and  gravy. The service-super friendly, the music-perfect, the valentines decorations up and ready for a big food and love fest!

Thanks to Chris and all the staff."}
{"text":"They refuse to make an over medium egg.  You get either over easy or well done.  Sorry I don't want to consume raw egg whites or have a rubber Frisbee.  I won't go there for breakfast because of it (my favorite meal).  Chef is an ass.  Their dinners and soups are amazing.  The owner is a great guy always says hi and really knows how to make his customers feel welcome.  His son-in-law cooks and doesn't listen (not a real chef).  I love the owner but if he can't manage the son-in-law that's hurting his restaurant, I don't have to go there.  I go for dinner.  So glad they added the credit card machine.  Service is usually great but at times he gets some really bad ones."}
{"text":"eggs ,sausages ,hashbrowns the greasier the better. Chris' has been there a long time. It has a wierd old diner smell. A mix of grease,mold and worn out everything. Havn't been since my friend had to fumigate bedbugs and  roaches 50 feet away at the motel and rowhouse."}
{"text":"we went there over a year ago. We walked in the door and there were all these older people giving my husband the stink eye. He is a little darker complected than they were. We ignored it. We ordered food. It was adequate. HOWEVER......he ordered fish and chips and it was literally the same triangle shaped fish you get from the frozen boxes in the store. In short, there food was nothing to write home about and the service was mildly adequate. The atmosphere was uncomfortable. It's not cool to be stared at by bigoted ignorant people. All in all, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This type of place is a favorite of mine.  An old time diner with good service, inexpensive and delicious food.  Don't expect any thing fancy but do expect to pay little in comparison to chain places for food just as good if not better.

The waitresses are friendly and will banter with you if you can play along.  On trips back to my hometown of Amherst, Ohio we always make a plan to stop by for breakfast.  I get the two eggs (over easy), hash browns, sausage patties with rye toast at the ridiculous price of $5.95.  The eggs are always perfect with the yokes good for dipping but not snotty.  You get a large potion of hash browns and the sausage patties are the biggest anyplace I've ever eaten.  There is more meat that you get on a Big Mac.  One review I read said that coffee is expensive for the size of the cup, but they will refill it for free for as long as you sit there and it is pretty tasty diner coffee.

The regulars keep it packed early in the morning but by 8:30 am getting a table is not an issue.  They always have fresh Lake Erie perch dinners and you owe it to yourself if you are visiting the area to try some of those beauties somewhere for lunch or dinner. Located right on Lake Erie in Lorain, Ohio!"}
{"text":"Came to Chris restaurant from a out of town job. I was sceptical at first small parking lot but completely packed so I decided it give it a try the bathrooms where clean and smelled fresh day down and the waitresses was prompt at serving me I ordered the ribeye med rare, eggs over easy, toast and homefrys the good came out quickly the steak was perfect at med rare eggs turned out good I don't normally like home frys but these where seasoned well and I actually enjoyed them hope I make it back out that way will deffinatly be going back. Maybe i will have to check out more of there huge menu for a small diner there's alot of options come and check them out you won't be disappointed."}
