{"text":"had lunch here about a month ago, when we walked in i thought the place was closed and they forgot to lock the door.  Well they were open but out of almost everything we tried to order.  finally just ordered a bbq sandwich, i was ok,"}
{"text":"Real solid BBQ pork plate and good BBQ sauces. The sides leave something to be desired but that's ok.  Great for the price.  Extremely friendly staff."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER a double burger !! You can't hold it with two hands. A regular burger is a half pound!  This is the first time eating here. The first impression when walking in is how clean everthing is. The exposed brick walls and picnic tables along with the rustic finished floor gives this restaurant atmosphere.  I ordered a cheeseburger with mustard,onions,chili, and slaw. Baked beans on the side. The burgers are actually charcoal cooked, and cooked to order. The burger was delivered to me in a few minutes and the first thing I noticed was the size. The charcoal taste is great. Overall it was one of the best restaurant burgers I've had in years. Now, for a little criticism; The cole slaw was fresh chopped and coated with a little vinegar and very little mayonaise. It was near dry. Needs more Dukes mayonaise.  The owner boasts of his BBQ and ribs. There will be  another day. The baked beans had a generic taste, but good. The iced tea tasted like good tea should. The menu offers burgers,dogs,ribs,BBQ,brusnwick stew,chicken n dumplings, peanut butter and jelly, and more.  Clean, fast friendly service, good food, and reasonable price  =  I'll be back !!!  Strongly recommend"}
