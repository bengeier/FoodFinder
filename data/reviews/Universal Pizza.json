{"text":"I used to go there but pizza tastes funky now. Service sucks. Once ordered a large and when grabbing box heard pizza sliding around so I opened it and it was the smallest large I ever seen. I questioned it and rudly she said well its the size of the pan, ya medium pan. Never going there anymore."}
{"text":"There gluten free dough is by far the best I have found and they make cinnamon dough with the left over dough from the pizza. Double win!"}
{"text":"Pizza is decent not overly garlic like Dominoes, the price is  decent too. Homemade sauce was a good thing 4 decades ago when sauce in a can was poor but now canned pizza sauce is very good and this sauce is not the best but the pizza sold here is thick, hearty and authentic. They  should used canned sauce instead. The dough is great here.. very thick and chewy, the sauce poor and the cheese good. They do not want to take credit cards unless the order is over $10 and are much more friendlier now that a new boss is in charge here."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but the place inside is DIRTY!!! It needs cleaned. The fan had dust on it, floor looked dirty. I was afraid to eat the pizza!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service and food I have ever had. Our food was all incorrect- garlic bread with cheese- had no cheese. Stromboli sauce on the side - sauce was inside and it was raw- yes raw!  When I called to tell them it was incorrect and raw the owner was rude and swore at me telling me I didn't order it right. When we picked it up the order was read back to us from the order slip and it was how I ordered it.  As a restaurant owner I know the dangers of serving and eating raw food."}
{"text":"I wanted to try another local pizza shop as I did not like the one near my home after several attempts. ordered a medium extra cheese pizza with extra sauce. The people are nice, but the pizza was just so so. The cheese was baked in away that did not allow for stringy cheese but more like compacted cheese and there wasn't a lot sauce as requested. On the bright side, the sauce present did taste good and I liked the crust. I will try this shop again a few more times before I call it a dud.. and so should other people! Have a good weekend and a Happy Easter! :)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place lower than one star, I would. They are conveniently located right down my street. I've been ordering from them at least twice a month since September for one and only one reason. They had gluten free pizza and strombolis. On several occasions, I have gotten my food and the order was wrong. The manager who answers the phone is always so rude and when you tell them your order is wrong he makes it out to be your fault. Well last night was the last and final time that I am ordering from them. We ordered a gluten free Italian Stromboli and a regular pepperoni roll for my fianc√©. The pepperoni roll literally had a later of raw dough in the middle. He was able to put it in our oven to cook it the rest of the way! My Stromboli also has raw dough, however I was unable to get it to finish cooking in the oven. I called then today and told the guy. He was the same guy who took the order and made it. He yelled at me and said I could bring it down if I wanted and then hung up on me. I have never experienced such rude service and disgusting uncooked food. I will no longer ever give them my business. And I can't expect them to be in business much longer either. I can not believe their service."}
{"text":"I have no clue how this place is still operating.  Only in Pittsburgh could a place with staff this poor and with such terrible customer service be still in operation.  I ordered a few Italian Calzones and the guy who took my order said it would be 30-45 minutes.  I showed up in 35 and the guy scolded me for showing up too soon.  Actually bitched at me for showing up too soon.  I wasn't really worried about the wait, but if you can't handle the pressure, he has no business being in the kitchen.  As I was sitting in that little filth hole they call an eatery, the old man was screaming and swearing at his staff.  Profanity laced tirades about having no meatballs and no marinara sauce.  Somebody ordered a meatball and the cook said, \" just cut the meatballs in half and make it work.\"  Who knows what sauce was on it, maybe ketchup.  I waited another 20 minutes then the old man really lost his temper.  One of the cooks turned a fan on and blew out the oven.  30 minutes with no heat in the oven!  So my calzone sat in the oven for an hour and 20 minutes before I got them.  I ordered and was charged for a side of sauce, which I never got because they were out.  Nothing ticks me off more than forgetting my side sauces.  The calzone was absolutely awful by the time I got to eat it.  This place is a disgrace."}
{"text":"Very solid pizza and great prices. They may not have the most friendly staff per the other reviews but I've never had an issue. The pizza is very good and the garlic knots are crazy good. Hoagies are ahh. All in all good food at affordable prices, It's a family favorite!"}
