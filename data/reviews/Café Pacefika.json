{"text":"GREAT PLACE

-Very lovely and cute (you can take many insta-worthy photos !!)

-I ordered a latte (cutest latte art btw!) and the barista/owner gave me a small pastry for free, apparently it is a special promotion at the moment if you are student.

-The seats are comfortable, many cushions, good wifi, and many outlets. 

-Noise level is very low, perfect for studying.

I highly highly recommend this place !!m"}
{"text":"This is such a cute little cafe! The barista is a bit cheeky but quite nice. I have ordered the soups many times (they have become a staple whenever I'm sick) because they are so reasonably priced, hearty and come with a delicious fresh roll! Would recommend, it feels quite homey, hot cocoa is yummy and they have great discounts if you are a student! :)"}
{"text":"I love this little cafe atmosphere, I like to study there in the morning.. but when it's crowded I try to avoid going there.
they give 10% discount for the student which is great
there menu for the breakfast is limited I hope they add more even if it's basic stuff e.g. fried eggs !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for breakfast/brunch with delicious open-faced sandwiches, lovely baked goods, and awesome tea. The staff are great and friendly and the atmosphere relaxing with good music. The mini pain au chocolat are delicious and a total steal at 50 cents! Prices all round very reasonable with the most expensive item on the menu topping out at about $7. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to study! It was quiet and the tables were big. The seats were comfortable and there were pillows as well! I got their filter coffee iced and it was good. Not super strong, so I got their Ristretto (which is a more intense espresso that is extra pressed according to the barista). The caffeine really kicked in and it really woke me up. The best perk about this cafe is that they offer a 10% discount to students and they have a stamp card for a free coffee. They accept credit and debit. I will definitely come back to study here!"}
{"text":"Belle découverte sur Lambert Closse, ce café est un peu en retrait, assez calme. Ils servent une large variété de café. J'y ai pris un bon cappuccino avec un café de type Hawaïen ainsi qu'une tartine au champignons. C'est délicieux et pas  trop cher non plus donc cela fait mon affaire. Il y a aussi du wifi donc c'est top!"}
{"text":"Come to this amazing coffee and tea shop!! They also have kombucha, good WiFi, a bookshelf, and a warm and welcoming aura. There are cute quotes on the wall and lots of comfortable seating. It's warm, so you'll take off all your layers. 

The coffee was very good! I got the Hawaiian latte one. The service was also insanely and incredibly welcoming, helpful, and kind. If you're ever in Montreal, come here!"}
{"text":"I just got good vibes from this little cafe. From the uke and mellow tones drifting you to it's Hawaii theme, to the friendly staff and the cute coffee art. There's good food available rather than just pastries. It also lends itself to being an awesome study space as the seats are comfortable, there's wi-fi and tons of spots to plug in. It's cosy and comfortable and I managed to go through a ton of work, was fed, hydrated and caffeinated."}
{"text":"One of my favourite unpretentious coffee shop in Montreal! It's usually a peaceful spot and they have some really nice and unique coffee blends. I especially love the Hawaiian  Kai beans for a nice blonde latte! They also have strong art game and might draw a bear in your latte."}
{"text":"They have AC and outdoor seating on a quiet street under shade across from the iconic Forum. The people who work there are nice. Couches inside. Tons of outlets. Amazing lentil soup. The rest of the food is probably good too - they make it onsite. Great spot."}
{"text":"Ordered a nordamericano thinking it was Nordic, but left wondering if it was french for North Americano."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered a latte on a weekday afternoon - it was busy but not packed and luckily I found a spot in the front to enjoy my drink (it is a small space).  The latte came with the cutest art on it (a bear).  I almost didn't want to drink it, but of course after I IG'd the crap out of that latte I did drink up.  If you are a student (and can show ID) I believe there is a discount or some promotion.  I was asked if I was a student (!!!!!!).  I was not sadly.

This place is unpretentious - sit back and enjoy your drink/pastries and read/work/chill.  No one will bother you here."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to come to this cute cafe after seeing it online. The baristas are nice and the atmosphere is very chill. 

Still a hidden gem. Very glad I found this place early.

The pastries and coffee are very good and they have a large menu of specialty coffee.

You can get 10% discount with a student ID which is nice as well. Free wifi is included, making it an ideal place to do work."}
{"text":"Cafe Pacefika is not difficult to describe; quite the contrary, it is easy through and through! The atmosphere is free and easy. The baristas are easy on the eyes. The coffee is easy on the pocket. You can enjoy your stay with an easy mind, and have an easy time of it! 

Horrendous puns aside, I wholeheartedly recommend this cosy coffee shop. For one thing, the menu is vast and includes coffee beans from Hawaii. For another, the baristas have a good command of latte art and are easy to be with. 

Even if you're not the easiest to please, I assure you that your visit here will be a hard act to follow."}
{"text":"Petit café cute, un peu en retrait dans le centre-ville de Montréal et nous avons été assez chanceuses de pouvoir s'asseoir sur la terrasse puisqu'elle ne contient que deux petites tables pour deux, avec un peu de faux gazon. Très cute. 

Je me suis pris un café au lait, avec le café de mélange Hawaiien. Sérieux, c'est sûrement un des meilleurs cafés que j'ai bu en longtemps. Il m'a coûté autour de 5$ avec le pourboire, mais le gentil garçon derrière le comptoir m'a dessiné un petit ourson dans ma mousse. Belle attention, service sympathique, délicieux café. Y'a pas grand chose à dire de plus!

Je dois définitivement y retourner pour manger une bouchée!"}
{"text":"Great new café! This is going to be one of my go-to study/work spots. Students get 10% off and a free pastry right now. I chose the freshly baked brownie and it's delicious! Service is great too :)"}
{"text":"I love that they carry CoAqua. They get a star just for that alone. It's a little expensive for coconut water, but well worth it. It's a New Zealand company that sources coconut water from Vietnam. 

Unfortunately, I was not particularly blown away by their coffee. I ordered a latte and I found it to be quite bitter.  Another negative was that I just couldn't get myself to stay very long. I know this is gonna sound weird but it kinda smelled odd, like a machinery workshop. I don't think it's their fault. Maybe it's the building or area?  Originally, I stepped into a neighboring cafe and they had the same smell there except it was a little overwhelming so I came here instead. Hope it's not a common occurrence.  Staff was really nice."}
{"text":"Quaint place.  Delicious food and coffee and helpful staff. Definitely recommend if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Wonderful café with an even better purpose.

I came to the café for an event and will definitely be back for a visit on my own. The café is located next to a clinic that serves underprivileged communities and specializes in pediatric development issues and gender variance. All the profits from this café goes to fund the clinic. It is a wonderful initiative and a very successful one. 

The café is warm, hip, and not pretentious. The coffees are yummy and thoughtfully made. 

I'm not sure how busy it gets, but I can see it being a good place to study during off-peak hours."}
{"text":"Bear latte art at Pacefika is super CUTE! Good vibes in this little cafe located next to Atwater station, it is a Hawaiian themed cafe that offers a variety of Tropical flavours, a lot of their coffee beans are from Hawaii, which are more sweat and fruity. Yet I decided to try the stronger beans from Italy, which was pretty good! The inside of the café is super cute and cozy, different corners with harmoniously arranged decor give people comfortable spots to read, study, talk, and so on. Cushions and sofas are super nice and comfy, which make people feel a bit sleepy (?), haha, but it's okay! I like it!"}
{"text":"Pacefika is perfect for studying and focusing on some work. The noise level is very low. Free wifi, lots of outlets, comfy seats with cushions everywhere, delicious pastries and drinks, and discounts for students. Maybe it is named after the Pacific Islands, but the place reminds me of a Moroccan living room.

Must try: the raspberry coconut macaroon (gluten free)!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely cafe with a very nice barista/owner. 
I found this cafe by coincidence in a huge snow. I ordered a latte with Hawaii flavor beans. The barista/owner gave me a small pastry because of the special promotion for student during February. 
I was surprised by the latte art, which is a smelling little bear. It was so cute!! I was even more surprised by the taste of the latte, fruity flavor, well balanced with milk, sooooo gooooood! The pastry that I chose was gluten-free, made with strawberry and coconut. It was very delicious too!
I love decorations inside too! There are also books and hardware that relate to coffee.
The second time I went there, I got latte and brownie. The latte tasted constantly good and the chocolate brownie was also delicious!! 
The third time I went there, I tried a latte with soy milk. The flavor was not as rich as regular latte but I like it. When I accidentally split out the soy latte because of unstable table, the barista/owner came clean immediately. After that he remade a cup of soy latte and switch the unstable table with the stable table that he was using. Such a kind person and A+ service! :) 
To conclude, I would like to strongly recommend this cafe because the coffee and service is great and the environment is good for studying or working or chatting with friends. I'll definitely go back there again."}
