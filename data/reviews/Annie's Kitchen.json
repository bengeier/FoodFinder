{"text":"Best food reminds me of cali soul food i eat here every chance i can i love the link dinner that sauce everything good prices also"}
{"text":"I had some finger licking good ribs today at Annie's Kitchen and the baked beans were second to none. #Thanks!"}
{"text":"Awesome $6 dollar meals!!! Ribs are awesome, and very cheap. SIdes could use some passion, but the ribs do make up for it lol."}
{"text":"This is the spot to go for the bestest and cheapest BBQ! Here's a tip! Don't order the combo with two meats because they will charge you double the price, but less food."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and the ribs quality have gone down a lot...they boil the ribs to get them tender then they put them on the grill to get the smoke flavor...that's cheating and boiling the ribs take the flavor out of them...and the baked beans always been nasty but I dealt with it cause the ribs were good...I have to find myself a new BBQ spot..."}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ I've found in Vegas!  In a not so great part of town which is probably why the close at 6 pm but the food is great, better than all of the other places that charge twice as much.  My only problem is that they are closed on Sunday and Monday!  Not really a sit down restaurant, the place is tiny and it's usually very hot, so be prepared to stand if there is a crowd, there are only about 4 tables inside, don't think I've ever seen anyone eating there.  I always get the ribs, they are flavorful and smoked perfectly.  Sauce is excellent but you don't need any so be sure to tell them you don't want sauce on your ribs.   When you are ordering the back door may be open and you can see the pits smoking their meats!  I'm craving some right now but it's Sunday afternoon and I gotta wait until Tuesday!  Sides were all excellent too. This is the closest you will get to your Uncle Willie's backyard BBQ on the 4th of July!!"}
{"text":"Annie's is not closed as I was there today for lunch.  I have been going to Annie's for years and it is still some of the best bar b que in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Google says they're open 10 to 6 but we drove all the way out here at 3 p.m. and they are not open."}
{"text":"Food be ok every now and then, seem like if the lady that takes the orders don't really wanna be there, not really to helpful, kind of disrespectful, not to mention they never got the brisket anymore, forsure goin down hill and it hurt me to write this cuz I support black business, but not when they don't appreciate the customer or the dollar!!"}
{"text":"The BBQ ribs are so delicious! Totally Juciy and falling off the bone. The sauce is off the hook and the portions are HUGE! I got a full plate which consists of the ribs, two sides and wheat bread all for only $12. I could not finish it at all. I will probably only get the half order the next time we go."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ hands down!! If anybody come on here and say anything different they are HATERS and probably workin for another restaurant to purposely give a bad review. I live in Northern California and make sure that this is a MUST EVERYTIME I come in to town. The staff is AMAZING!!! If ur in town make this a DEFINITE stop!! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"I know you're in love with Ella Em and even have an affair with M&M Soul Food.  Pretty please, give this place a try.  My wife and I just had lunch there.  It was THE BEST soul food we've ever had.  Real - none of this wannabe healthy, watered down, palatable to the masses, reinterpreted, deconstructed, nouveau stuff.  Imagine pulling up to a little food stand in the South where a small family cook up great food on a daily basis and sell it for weary travelers. This is exactly that type of place. Greens were smoked, beans had a beautiful complex dark brown sugar molasses flavor, brisket was fatty (just the way I like it) and tender, macaroni salad was just like my wife remembers it growing up in Lynwood, California (next to Compton) made with the short small pasta tubes that look like short plumbing pipes.  Really, really good food.  Cash only.  The peach cobbler is also insanely good.  It's only $2 or you can get a large peach cobbler for $4.  Corn bread muffin was flaky and moist but not overtly so.  Please support our small, local, mom & pop businesses.  This place is perfect for takeout if you live or work in the area.  Notes:  No Credit Cards, No Debit Cards, No Diet Soda - it's just not that kind of place.  Step into a small takeout window counter and be rewarded once you sit down to feast.  Lots of food for the price.  We paid $25 total including tip for two meals which is easily more like four meals.  In terms of decor, it's very basic and I wish some kind artist would step up and offer to refresh/repaint their mural on the side of their building."}
{"text":"While driving by, I saw this in the most interesting part of town.  Most people won't even stop here, yet I decided to try it. Omfg, it is the one of hole in wall place people read about in the books or hear from amazing people.  I strongly recommend try it. Food is hella cheap.   I asked for diet drink and she laughed.  They only have orange, grape, lime drinks.   The person who took the order was really nice and helped me pick my food."}
{"text":"I'm a regular Yelp checker..but don't normally actually submit reviews...but this time I feel it necessary to give my ENDORSEMENT...   I've been a Vegas local for the last few years and have been trying to find a good  old \"around the way\" kinda RIB JOINT.. not just a chain bbq restaurant ( Famous Dave's, Memphis, etc...) ...   THIS IS MY PLACE TO GO when I don't feel like doing it myself...  The price is right and the food is good...    While not in the most desirable part of town, it's definitely worth checking out.."}
{"text":"My husband  and I had our weekly lunch date. Today, we decided to eat at our neighborhood eatery Annie's . We ordered a little of this and that. Tamales, chicken and fries, beef hot link, macaroni salad, and baked beans all for the low cost of $34.00. The service was exceptional as always. If you need flashing lights, and fancy decor to enjoy your meal, you will definitely miss out on some GOOD food!!!We highly recommend Annie's."}
{"text":"Great! I heard an ad for this place on the radio. While looking through photos people posted on Yelp, I saw that they smoke turkeys for the holidays. With that being said, I got a turkey smoked by them for Thanksgiving. I knew I was taking a chance because I had never tried their food, but the reviews I read were good.   We were VERY satisfied with the end result. You buy your own turkey, and they'll smoke it for $25. Not a bad deal. It was delicious! The only downside is that you won't know when it's going to be done. I'd recommend making sure someone is available to pick it up the day before, because they can't give you a timeframe.   Otherwise we were happy with how it came out , and I could see us going back.  ***They do not accept credit or debit cards***"}
{"text":"I love Annie's kitchen. They have cheap plates and it's sooooooo freakin good not to mention the Tamales... yum yum yum. I'm waiting for them to open now so I can go"}
{"text":"My coworker Dan just bought for us lunch from this place, ribs, tamales and  sausage with baked beans....omg I have no words super Delicious I cant wait to visit this place personally."}
{"text":"Ribs are good, sides are lacking taste."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent prices!! Plenty of food for the price.  Everything on my plate was good and enough to feed three people. The ribs are the bomb!"}
{"text":"i went there on a recomend from some friends. absolutely worth it. the food was so good.my only criticism was the sauce was a little too salty for me. i don't like sauce all over everything because i want to taste the flavors in the proteins. next time i will just tell them to put the sauce on the side. we tried the links and ribs as well as the cole slaw, greens mac and cheese and beans. the beans were terrific! had a flavor and a sweetness that were not over bearing but distinctive.  the mac and cheese was cheesy and firm, which is how i prefer it. the place is a little hole i the wall. i had t wait 20 mins fr m orders and i would wait 40 mins next time if i had to! get down there and try the food out. its great!!"}
