{"text":"Very good solid offering - nothing exceptional or spectacular - needed the \"spicy oil \" to make the pizza pop  You can't do badly  But in the other hand , won't be wowed we had the jardiniere pizza - slightly undercooked on the center, nice crispy crust and lots of fresh veggies... Rocket salad was excellent, hearts of palm - OK,  dessert - 9tiramisu) just OK like i said, nothing bad, but nothing great....."}
{"text":"Not very fresh food eggplant Parmesan tasted bitter and portions were not even close to other branches of this restaurant. The salad was completely wilted. They need some quality control here!"}
{"text":"We had pizzas and an entree and they were quite good. Sadly, the service was terrible. We got served by a bald server with a chest tattoo (on the bill it said Hugo). From the get-go he made us feel like we were an annoyance just to be in his presence. I don't know if it was the fact we were speaking in English to each other.  He never smiled and when he asked us how the food was he was already halfway across the room. He also made us give him our plates when we were done and didn't even say thank you. When we told him at the cash at the end of our service about how we felt, he did not even offer an apology. We will not be returning here!"}
{"text":"Potentiel à pizzas cuites dans un four à bois, on se laisse tenter, mais en réalité si les prix sont abordables c'est que la qualité des aliments en pâtit. Le service est correcte mais sans plus, le pizzaiolo est très jeune, peut-être un peu pressé. Au premier abord tout semble bien, mais une fois l'assiette sur la table on se rend compte que la pâte n'est pas cuite et que tous les ingrédients sont sans goût :( grosse déception. Juste un bon vin blanc de table pour rattraper la nourriture. Place à éviter. Pour ma part sur ma liste noire car nous a valu un bon mal d'estomac."}
{"text":"Horrible food. The salad was old, the soup \"strachatella\" which is supposed to be beaten egg soup tasted like water with a whole broken egg in it.  Never again."}
{"text":"I guess it was OK for a tourist area. Pizza was a little soggy. They could not make it spicy for me but they did provide 2 types of spice. service was good but not to much smiles."}
