{"text":"This place is intensely overpriced for what it is, which would essentially be: mediocre food that one settles for as it is the ONLY restaurant in the entire shopping complex.   I have unfortunately had to endure this place on more than one occasion as I work in the building. I've had:  Chicken Teriyaki Lunch $8.95- Sahara desert dry, overcooked, reheated chicken on a bed of cabbage with basic mediocre rice, bland miso soup and whilted salad drenched in watery sauce.  Spicy Chicken Bokum $14.95- Barely any chicken. Barely. Maybe half a breast. The meat is stir fried with exclusively cabbage, chosen no doubt because it is a nice cheap filler. The sauce for this dish was just ok, nothing that one cannot get at any run of the mil korean place on Christie and Bloor (though the cost wouldn't be $15).  Spicy Salmon Salad $6.95- This was honestly the best thing that I had here... which is sad seeing as the salad was whilted and covered in korean Gochujang. That's all it really is.   My friend who was unfortunately lunching with me one time also ordered the Take Sushi Boat Tray. The fish was nothing special, nothing that isn't available everywhere else for a much better price. The rice was water logged and not properly seasoned.  After three experiences here I have decided to give up. On the days that I forget to pack lunch I just choose to skip the meal rather than hand over money to eat another depressive meal here."}
{"text":"Take out is a scam with this place! Expensive, sad food, they do not care about the customers, since this is the only restaurant in the whole mall. I always avoid this place."}
{"text":"Service is awesome, food is always fresh and authentic, and they have the best teriyake beef I've ever had.  Not super cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for.   Unless you know the strip plaza/area, you probably wouldn't even know this place existed. It's tucked away inside a plaza next to a shoppers drug mart.   Don't get to come to this spot too often just because it's a little awkward to get to if you don't drive, but I definitely go any chance I get."}
{"text":"I tried it 2, at most 3 times. I live close and hoped it would get better. If it did they could easily pack their restaurant, but even though small it is always empty when I now just walk by.  The fish is not good, but it is decently kept. The reason for the 2 star, is they use almost no fish, and then tripple roll the sushi, so the rice layer is doubleing over itself. In all my sushi endeavors I have never seen this before."}
{"text":"Ahh the constant search for good sushi continues . Daisaky is clean, new and empty. The sushi is fresh yet average.  momiji is no better"}
