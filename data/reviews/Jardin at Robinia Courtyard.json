{"text":"What pure pleasure -- exquisite food, professional service, aesthetically pleasing space with acoustics that allow for good conversation.  Loved every part of the experience!"}
{"text":"Wake up Madison!  I loved Julep and you let that slip away, do not let Jardin slip away.  We went on a Saturday night, there were probably 3 tables filled, thankfully more people came in as we were leaving.  Atmosphere, food and service was all great.    Our table enjoyed the hanger steak, leg of lamb and roasted chicken.  To drink we all had a Hot Toddy.  I will be going back again and I suggest  you do the same."}
{"text":"Really classy place. I went towards the end of winter and was somewhat concerned when there was only one other party at the restaurant.

We ate mostly small plates and everything was good, but some of the flavors could have been more bold.

At the end of the meal I left my wallet by mistake, but I was able to retrieve it with all money and cards untouched the next day.

I look forward to coming back when the weather is right to enjoy the courtyard."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant with a selection of dishes to please the midwestern palate. The focused menu offered dishes reminiscent of the food scene over the last decade. The flavors were pleasing and execution was solid, but nothing too innovative here. 

I had the potato-leek soup to start, and the flank steak on truffled grits with collard greens and mushrooms for my main. I also sampled the dishes of my companions. All dishes were flavorful and cooked perfectly. The preparations were a little on the heavy side. 

The service was attentive and timely, but the waitress knew very little about the menu. She had to go back to the kitchen several times for answers to our questions. One guest at our table asked what spices were in the lamb pappardelle, and the waitress came back from the kitchen with an answer of chives. After she left, everyone at the table laughed, and we debated whether the chef did not want to share his secret or the waitress was that clueless. 

I would go again if others wanted to go, but it will not make my A-list."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with Jardin at Robinia Courtyard. We ordered a number of small plates and a couple of entrees, and everything was beautifully plated and incredibly delicious. The service was fast and friendly, and the cocktails (though not a huge selection) were good. The desert menu was limited, but the brownie was a generous portion and delicious. We will definitely return here for the impressive food and trendy ambiance."}
{"text":"This place not only hits your aesthetic needs but also covers the cravings you didn't even know you were having! The food quality is hands down top notch, considering how much of a spot light there is on it. Having dinner here once was not enough, a second visit was required. Everything from the philipino ceviche to the pork belly special was on point. The cocktail menu was also very intriguing. It represented the forever growing kombucha craze to the classic freshness of cucumber and jalapeno. They also have a satisfying spectrum of wines. Offering enough variety and potential pairings. The only suggestion I would offer on the food I had, would be to cut the fresh figs in 1/4 as opposed to 1/2. Keep it up. A must return! Check it out Madison!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, we got the soup and duck. Portions are smaller but adequate. Delicious food and great service! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is in the old Savaduski's fur place if you are a local and remember it. There was another great restaurant here before Jardin that didn't make it for some unknown reason. This is a quality place that others have reviewed quite well so I will just say the food is great and so is the service. There is a second bar in there as well not associated with Jardin, so when you walk in Jardins is in the back. Street parking only is a  pain but lots of places are like that so buck up and give it a try."}
{"text":"Good food and cocktails, but not quite up to the stiff competition, in my opinion. The food was well prepared, had multi-dimensional flavors, but had a certain Wisconsin predictably to it, as if there's a list of dishes every typical Wisconsin restaurant must have, and this one complied. 

One turnoff was when I asked the server about the preparation of my lamb dish, which had a number of spices and was garnished with chives. I had to ask the waitress twice what was in it, because I really liked it, and the only answer she could give me was \"chives.\"  I know that!  I can see them!  She said that was all the kitchen would share with her about the preparation of the dish. That totally does not fly in a foodie town like Madison!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for not-too-crowded fine dining on a Friday night, Jardin is the place to go. The spacious restaurant's entrance is easily overlooked on East Wash, but it is definitely worth a stop. 

My mom and I came by for dinner and it was refreshing to go to such an uncrowded nice downtown restaurant (but hopefully traffic picks up, because this place is a winner).

I ordered the Cosmonaut to drink, and for dinner we split the Leek, Potato and Celeriac Soup, the Roasted Cauliflower, and the Seared Duck Breast. While the soup was a bit salty, we both still really enjoyed it. All of the dishes were beautifully plated. The small plates were actually fairly big, so they are good for sharing. 

One of the other reviews mentioned a problem with timing/staging, but for us each of the dishes were presented one after the other and each after we'd finished the previous, so it seems like that issue has been resolved. 

Prices are a bit high, but no higher than competitor Madison restaurants.

I would definitely be interested in going back and trying more of their dishes. This is a restaurant I would recommend for uncramped weekend date nights."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews we thought this could be a good choice for a relaxing, upscale dining experience last night. Suffice to say we were extremely dissapointed in the table service. Although the restaurant was less than half full our dishes were rushed to our table, and not coursed as the server said they would be. We were to share our appetizers. But both large plates were simultaneously brought and left at our table. There was no way to quickly eat both plates without them getting quite cold first. Very dissapointing since we were there for a very nice relaxing dinner. Also, serving utensils for the dishes were not provided. I had to get up and go find the server to request large spoons. When she brought the spoons to the table I reminded her that she was to course the plates. She said, \"well.... most people just DIG IN.\"  Good Lord!!  One was a heavy cream based dish and the other an Asian sauce based dish. We ate the cream base first. Being we were each only given one plate each for the appetizers I had to ask her for clean plates for the second appetizer.  We were \"still eating the second, COLD appetizer\" when she showed up with both entrees. This was extremely irritating. I again reminded her about the coursing, pointed out that we were not done with our appetizers, and she cursely said \"well, I guess I could have waited one more minute\".  We were appalled With her response and general cluelessness. Needless to say our desire for a relaxing, upscale dinner resulted in a very unfortunate dining experience.  The server obviously was not trained in the finer aspects of what makes for a special dining experience for the customer. And it's too bad. The food? Well,  my partners duck was quite overly chewy and rather bland, and my lamb pappardelle was more of a one-note pasty stroganoff.   I wish I could give a better report, I really do.  Needless to say, my partner and I will not be returning for a second dinner."}
{"text":"Came in at 945 on a Friday for a drink, sat down and was handed a menu by a bartender, then rudely told by the same bartender to leave because they were closing.  RIP Julep JR.  Robinia courtyard need to get their sh!t together, what a waste of a great space.

Update following Jardin's response:  it seems the rudeness we experienced when we were told to leave extends to the yelp responses.  I'll go back...when it's a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Only three tables seated tonight in this wonderful space. Of course, it's a few days before Christmas and finals week at UW. 
We enjoyed being in a space where we could have a conversation without shouting and repeating. 
Our table of 4 enjoyed ceviche, a Spanish salad full of tasty greens and olives, whitefish, roasted duck and locally sourced flank steak. 
Each serving left one wanting to lick the plate. Presentation was lovely and the service was attentive. 
The beer menu was very extensive. Wine was reasonably priced with a nice pour. 
We will certainly be return customers.   There's lots more to try on this well curated menu."}
{"text":"Very tasty place. The Spanish salad and cauliflower were excellent starters. We had the flank steak and whitefish for our mains and were not disappointed. Cool space and great food! I hope more people check it out!"}
{"text":"This is on the same level of creativity, execution, and mouth melting flavor as L'Etoile and Heritage. This is food at its highest level.

I've been to 3 star Michelin restaurants in NYC, Paris, Hong Kong, and Tokyo and this is bite for bite as creative and tasty as any. The only thing missing is the white table cloth and the insane prices. The value, quality, and hip atmosphere are unmatched in Madison."}
{"text":"We visited Jardin during Restaurant Week, so please keep that in mind when reading my review.  It wasn't their normal operation or menu.  I love the decor, especially the plants.  The waitstaff and bartenders were very nice, professional and accommodating.  I have to be honest, I wasn't that impressed by the food.  I thought the portions were very small and the food was on the salty side.  I was intrigued by the descriptions of the food, so the concept was there.  I just wish I was more wowed by the food for that price."}
{"text":"Amazing food, wonderful service, and great ambiance. Some of the best food we've had in Madison! Good value for upscale dining. Small plates are larger than average. We got Spanish salad and shrimp for small plates. We got Braised Lamb, Wild Mushrooms, and Steak for large plates. The cheesecake dessert was great too, but a small portion. Full bar with many local options. The signature cocktail list was small, so if you don't find something you like, the bartender will make you what you want. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Decent drinks, but I found a stone in my food which found its way into my mouth - on a vegetarian item.  Happy New Year, I suppose.  No thank you."}
