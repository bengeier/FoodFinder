{"text":"Food is pretty good, decent size burrito for the price for in an airport. The staff when I was there was not pleasant, seemed like you were bothering them by placing an order."}
{"text":"Low hygiene, staff is really slow. The meet looks like it came from last century.   They also gave my order to someone else and I had to wait again for them to remake it.   Won't be coming here again, the only reason I walked in was line up at burrito boys was too long"}
{"text":"It really saddens me to write this. I had such high hopes for this place - anyone who's stood in front of the building over the past couple years saw it: poutine upstairs, burritos below... can you imagine if they were combined!? But Smokes should probably just stick to what they know.  I just tried the (only) vegetarian option on the menu, that features black beans and yams, neither of which tasted remotely resh. The burrito was overwhelmed with huge pieces of crunchy coleslaw which felt entirely out of place, and the worst part of all? No cheese.  What it ultimately comes down to is there's no reason to eat here when Burrito Boyz is two doors down, making some of the best in the city. Smokes has moved into the old BB kitchen, but hasn't adapted any of the elements that made the previous tenants great. All that said, if Smokes were to introduce a burrito with their veg poutine, cheese curds and french fries in it, I'd be on that shit in a minute."}
{"text":"Poor burrito experience. Cheese is optional and consists of habanero cheddar only?! Le Madre was missing salt, lime juice, tomato, sour cream and salsa, by design or oversight. The burrito was soggy, consisting mostly of rice and beans. Meat was fine but there was not very much of it. Worst burrito ever. Better off visiting Burrito Boyz a few doors down. Will not be back."}
{"text":"As far as first impressions go, this was far from good. The service is very slow, understanding that they are trying to figure things out but perhaps they should have waited to open another week to tweak things out. Btw, this was on the regular service day not grand opening.  I was hoping that it was a \"worth the wait\" experience but not exactly. I got the Desnudo Celoso (pulled pork bowl). The best part were the tomatoes. The pork was so salty it overwhelmed everything else.  There are far better burritos establishments in the area, the probability of a return visit is low."}
{"text":"For a grand opening, it was horrible service. Waited 45 minutes for 3 burritos, and there were only 3 other customers in the place. I arrived well after the $1 deal was over so it was hardly busy. They didn't inform me that it was cash only until after I had placed my order, and they had no information for where the nearest atm was. I had to walk 10 minutes to the nearest bank. Not worth the wait, and the burrito tasted like watered down beans."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto today visiting family and heard that Smoke's expanded into the Burrito market. As a frequent visitor to the Smoke's Poutinerie and Weinerie in Oshawa, we decided to give this new concept a try.   You walk down a flight of stairs to a small, yet colourful store. It looks pretty nice, with a sauce bar and a funky donkey decor. There is a sauce that is kept behind the counter to build excitement, where you apparently have to sign a contract to try it.   We decided to try \"wacky\" burritos, to switch up from the normal burrito. I had the Pad Thai and it was horrible. Not sure if it was because we went for lunch, and they used the same rice from the previous nice, but it was hard, over cooked and lacked flavour.   There wasn't anyone else in the restaurant, so service was fast and friendly, but I think that was the only positive to this burrito experience.  It was a huge let down. I hate comparing but the competition is better. I think you should stick to what you know...poutine and hot dogs."}
{"text":"Bland burritos and overpriced. If you want good burritos, go to burrito boyz next door - better tasting and cheaper.   The service here was good though."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised as I had low expectations. The spicy burrito is great and had my nose running worse than a 1980s stock trading coke fiend in a club on Friday night."}
{"text":"Great fix after a long night at work. I went out on a limb and tried one of their 'wacky' burritos: chicken pad thai. Picked it up at around 11:30 after a shift at work. Wasn't too busy at this point, had polite and efficient service and got my burrito within ten minutes. Took it home and was amazed by the taste. It literally tastes like a pad thai you can hold and eat in your hands. Once you get over the initial weirdness of this, it's a lot of fun to eat. It was also filling enough that I ate the other half at lunch the next day. If you want to try other varieties: they've got poutine, spaghetti and meatballs and chicken and waffles to name a few. But don't worry, if you just want your burrito to be a burrito, they have traditional varieties to choose from too. But, I mean, with a BurritoBoyz literally next door, you might as well go for it. I've only had pad thai so far, but I'm definitely looking at poutine for next time."}
{"text":"It's pretty average. While waiting for my flight in the morning I for some reason didn't feel like Tim Hortons (as a fellow Canadian I was also shocked at myself). Looking around and saw someone else eating a breakfast burrito so I thought why not? Burrito was pretty standard, you get to choose your type of meat and toppings and they grill it. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't the amazing either, just enough to get me by. Plus side after my flight I had no upset stomach or diarrhea and it kept me full for the 2 hours it took to get me to Winnipeg. Yes it is a bit pricey but then again I expect that from everything in Pearson airport. So yeah for an average burrito it hit the spot."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential to get 5 stars from me but the staff wasn't very friendly. The woman working either hated her job or was very sad, maybe both? Either way, she made me feel almost guilty for ordering food. Not the service I wanted for an 11 dollar burrito. The food was delicious though. Next time I'm at this airport I'll definitely give this place another chance at 5 stars."}
{"text":"When I saw the renovations to set up a Smoke's Burrito shop below the Poutinerie and steps away from Burrito Boyz, I was excited that we would see some serious competition to raise the bar on burrito dining on Adelaide.  Unfortunately Smoke's does not bring the burrito game, and is only an also ran.  The prices are ok, with a $7.49 grande size burrito, and a $8.99 mucho grande, and the burrito sizes are indeed more generous than Burrito Boyz.  However, you only pick from their handful of burrito styles, unless you pay another $0.50 to customize your burrito.  The ingredients taste less fresh than the ones next door, and look less appealing, including the neon orange rice.  The décor isn't welcoming either, with the bright green and brown walls.  A bright spot is that when they take your order, they write it on a sticker with your name and toppings so you can remember what you're getting.  If we can get a third burrito place on Adelaide we might see some more heated burrito competition yet."}
{"text":"Smoke's Burritorie is A-OK! It has revamped it's image since taking over the old space from Burrito Boyz. The shop is clean and the staff is mostly friendly and informed... mostly. I've visited a few times and some of the staff looks like they could care less. Smoke's seems to be doing okay being in the midst of Burrito Boyz and Fat Bastards but it's pretty quiet e very time I pass by. Main reason I come here is their wacky burritos. Oddly enough, my top pick would be the Pad Thai burrito. It's pretty damn good pad thai! The Chicken n Waffles is a good breakfast burrito... but they're not open for breakfast :p The Poutine burrito is decent and you get to choose your protein. The Spaghetti and Meatballs is meh for me but my BF likes it. Tried their tacos recently and it wast just okay, there's too much pickled veggies it hides the meat flavour. Haven't has a chance to try their regular burritos but I'd rather go to Burrito Boys for that. I'll be back for the pad thai burrito tho!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Valiant attempt at changing up the Toronto burrito scene but the results are mixed  Why: Brand new and from a great brand - how can you not want to try it!  What: Beef Burrito  Who: Went solo  When: Friday at 7:30pm  The Story:  Super excited to try the burrito. First thing that you notice (other than the oddly placed donkey/\"ass\" photos on the wall) is the limited me of cutely named burritos with set toppings. Guess you can't build your own?  Was recommended the Beef so went with it. The wait was average and receiving the burrito was great as it had a sticker with my name and order written on it!  The burrito was okay. They're attempting to add in interesting toppings like crunchy onion, but it just adds confusion to your palate and experience more than anything else. Was also disappointed that I wasn't asked about toppings, sauces, or spice. I would have made it my own if possible.  I'm also not convinced there was that much beef inside.   Next Time: I'd be happier going to the staple burrito joints within walking distance... Or just get the fries upstairs!  Was suggestes the"}
{"text":"Poorly staffed. Mediocre ingredients (not fresh). Has the feel of fast food generic with crappy seating and a depressing vibe. There are lots of good burrito places nearby. This one will fail."}
{"text":"Even if you're starving, stay away from this place! Nasty is an understatement. Ordered a chicken rice bowl and ended up losing my appetite once I removed the lid of the bowl. Chicken seemed synthetic, cilantro rice almost chipped my tooth from how hard it was, just plain gross. And don't get me started with the customer service.... I'll just leave it at that."}
{"text":"For the price of a burrito bowl, you could go out and get a decent meal with more umph in flavour. Granted, this is in the airport and the prices are jacked up. The chicken meat was the tiniest portion, and the flavour was quite bland.   While I wouldn't give any stars for the food, the service was quite lovely and orders were made quickly so that passengers could go on their way and make their flights."}
{"text":"They have maybe 6 options and no fish or shrimp (seriously??).  I had the La Madre - you'd figure the standard chicken chicken burrito, at the top of their menu would be the best. I made a bad decision in hindsight as the amount of lime ingredients in there had me eating a sour burrito, as opposed to give it a kick.  The burrito was unimpressive and bland otherwise.  You also have to pretty much stick with the ingredients that each burrito has unless you want to pay more to make your own.  Disappointing considering there are enough successful burrito joints around to learn from.  Smoke's has a lot of fixing to do, and given that burrito boyz has a new, larger establishment 2 doors down, their future may not fair well."}
{"text":"Walked by on the way to a concert in the area, and needed a quick dinner. Figured this was something new, so we might as well give it a try!  Essentially, this is another place similar to Chipotle, with just a couple slight variations. Still offered the same meats, but was nice to see some other options for the rice, slaw and other toppings.   I decided to go for a pulled pork bowl, and thought it was okay... Nothing specifically mind blowing. Portions were smaller than other burrito joints though.   The staff were quite nice, but most of them were just standing around. They may have been training some new guys, but still looked like a lot of them weren't doing anything. The staff were also moving really slow. Whether that was taking your order, or putting food in the bowl. I was getting annoyed just watching them!  Not the worst burrito place, as there are some unique combinations, but probably won't be back here considering Burrito Boyz is literally 2 stores down!"}
{"text":"I happened upon Smoke's Burritorie on a late night with a friend. Considering how much I like Smoke's Poutinerie, I thought that I'd found gold.  Walking inside, you'll have access to a small amount of seating, that was frankly not very clean as some tables were still messy with previous customers' meal leftovers. Keeping true to the Smoke's theme, you'll see an unnerving number of pictures of the Smoke's mascot, and special to the Burritorie, you'll find a bunch of donkeys, which I assume is a somewhat racially offensive nod to Latino culture.  So after ordering from the somewhat abrasive server, I sat down with their taco bowl. For about $7.50 (no tax) you get three tacos with the option of: three different flavours, all the same flavour, etc. They have different meats like chicken and beef, and interesting toppings like mango and pineapple. Honestly, I can talk about the positives of the dish, but all in all, this was a case of flair and pizzazz rather than quality ingredients and care. The soft taco bread was stale. Some of the wacky flavour combinations were misguided. Nothing suggested much freshness. What the Burritorie does have going for it is that the pricing is pretty attractive for the amount of food that you get.  All in all, for once, I'm probably not coming back."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to the VIP Launch Party to sample five of their new products that'll be released tomorrow to the public (March 1st, 2016). Four of which are the: pad thai, poutine, chicken and waffles, and spaghetti and meatballs burritos. The fifth is a new line of mini burritos called \"Cigar Burritos\" that feature taquito-sized burritos and 20 free dipping sauces to choose from!   First, let me say that the party was such a blast! I loved the vibes, the staff were super amazing and friendly, and the notably \"unlimited free food\" part really hit the spot.   Although my brain wanted to try all of their new products, my stomach only let me try 3. 1) Chicken and waffles - this was my first order, as well as the one I felt was most appealing, AND IT WAS DELICIOUS. Y'know the type that makes you feel like you'll have a heart attack at any moment but it'll be worth it? Yea, I felt it. It was a burrito filled to the brim with soft fluffly waffles, tender shredded fried chicken, moist scrambled egg, a lot more bacon than my feeble heart could handle, and was generously drizzled with a maple syrup sauce.  2) While waiting for the above beauty to be made, staff were walking around handing out free samples of the cigar burritos. I tried the steak and cheese one, which was more like beef cold cut (not very appealing to me) but I absolutely LOVED that they had so many dipping sauces to choose from (20, as you will see from my pictures). Though I did not try all of the sauces, I particularly enjoyed the butter chicken and honey mustard!  3) Pad thai - they were so unbelievably generous with the shrimp! But the rest of it was pretty standard, definitely outshined by the novelty and flavour profile of the chicken and waffles that I had just eaten. The pad thai noodles were good with a slight kick of spice, and I personally loved the added aroma and texture of the crushed peanuts.  I came here last September for the grand opening and this has been my first time back since. I'm quite happy with the new direction that Smoke's has taken with this launch and I look forward to the revival of their Burritorie franchise :)"}
{"text":"I had the Chorizo Bravo with all the toppings available.  It was a large portion but other burrito places are bigger.  The price isn't bad at $7.49 + tax.  I enjoyed the cilantro and spicy chorizo flavours but it wasn't as spicy as I was hoping for.  There aren't too many options on the menu but hopefully they will expand it soon or they will lose business from their competitor Burrito Boyz a few doors down.    The service was a bit slow but I think they were training new employees.  Unlike Smoke's Poutinerie, the Burritorie doesn't have the loyalty cards."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant, fast food or otherwise. The staff were both surly and indifferent. It was dinner time and they had run out of both guacamole and salsa. No apologies, but lots of anger at management - but taking it out on the customers. Not cool."}
{"text":"When you decide to open up a burrito place a few doors next to Burrito Boyz, you know you need to bring it.  This place didn't.  Chicken burrito was okay.  The burrito size is significantly smaller than Burrito Boyz but the cost was more.  I went here only because I forgot to go to lunch early to best the rush at Burrito Boyz.  Service was slow as well and you can tell the staff isn't as experienced as at Burrito Boyz but I guess you need to start somewhere.  I probably won't come again even though."}
{"text":"I only write to types of reviews really amazing places or really shitty places. Sadly this is the latter.  First of all I already lowered my expectations of this place on their grand opening when I left work early lined up, only to be told they ran out of burritos. That's like an airline telling thanks for booking with us but we have no plane to take you. In my mind that is unacceptable. Especially  since they were hyped up on blogTo.   Now the actual review.   Pros about this place + smoke's brand (known for spin on gourmet poutine  + Staff seem nice and have high energy but I did have to wait like 30 seconds while the cashier was wrapping up her conversation with her co worker before I got to order  Cons - I ordered the chorizo burrito and the texture was awful. Couldn't taste the sausage at all. Toppings were lacking.  - size was pathetic  - the burrito didn't have a fresh citrus and crunch that Mexican food is known for.  - Smokes a brand known for gourmet poutine disappointed there isn't a poutine burrito  Summary In conclusion, on Adelaide street west seems to he's very highly competitive burrito place, you've got much better options out there from competitors who have made a name for themselves in the burrito business namely Burrito Bandidos and Burrito Boyz (and some degree Z-Teca) your money is better off spent else where."}
{"text":"I would have loved to be the first one to rate this place, but I didn't know how to create the establishment. I came here on opening day on September 14, 2015.  I have backlogs of reviews yet I decided to review this place immediately - to tell you to stay the hell away (at least based on my experience). So bit of disclaimer: I overlooked many many many mishaps - because it was opening day and due to the establishment selling their signature burritos at $1, they were noticeably busy. Thus, I did not expect perfect 10/10 service at this time. So service was not accounted for the purpose of review score.   Went at 11AM and lined up for 1.5 hours - opening day, $1, it was expected. No docked point. However, I would not have bothered to go here if I only knew I could get 1 burrito (wait time is not worth $6~7 I am saving). On their twitter, someone asked \"how many can one get\" and Smoke's response was \"as many as you want\". No mentioning during line up nor in any of signs. I am a greedy pig - but don't put something on press (twitter) then not follow up. Not a good first impression, but did not dock point off since it could have been miscommunication and its also understandable. Just don't put something on facebook or twitter next time. Evident from this link:  https://twitter.com/poutinerie/status/642336904734633984 (not sure when this will get \"removed\")  I ordered Cerdo Celoso (Jealous Pig) - normally $7.50 or $9.00.  When I got to the end, a person took the order down saying \"it makes them focus on making burrito\" - okay, sounds good (the person did say this is not normal procedure). Had some miscommunication with the cashier (which I can overlook). Then waited 10 minutes after my friend got the burrito - asked about where is my food when others after me have gotten the food and the guy who was making burritos said \"sorry, forgot about your order\" - what? The whole point of getting another person taking order during opening day was so you can focus on making the burrito! Again, fine, its $1 and its opening day - I can over look this fact since you can be busy.  Then I had the burrito - it sucked! For one, rice was waaaaaaaaaaaay too sour - there was not enough fat to cut the sourness. It was called kick-ass rice but they should really look into the name again because I thought I was drinking lime extract. My friend even commented on how sour this was. Rice also felt overcooked - trust me, I am an asian. I eat rice every frigging day. Then the way they made my burrito was almost infuriating - he probably realized that he forgot about my burrito and made it in a rush because I tell you - first half was all rice and beans. one quarter after that, all meat. Then last quarter was all carbs again. I get that its $1 but I was not impressed. My guess was that even though they were charging $1 now, it was to represent what $7.50 or $9.00 would have gotten you. However, If this is how they are going to wrap their burrito at full price, I can't go back. Not only was meat to carb ratio way off, but way they wrapped it was both insult to myself and Mexico. The taste was off too, as balance of flavor was simply not there and due to sourness of the rice, I couldn't taste anything else. My friend's steak burrito seemed to fare better - lime cilantro tasted less sour but I would still go back to Burrito Boyz after my experience this time. This was by far the least tasty (if there is \"taste\" in this piece of mexican insult) burrito I have ever had.   WORST. BURRITO. EVER.   My biggest disappointment, however, is that I cannot give 0 star on Yelp. So that was the con, what about pros? Well, I was glad I didn't get to grab more than 1 burrito - because I would have cried about spending additional money for rest of my life."}
{"text":"4 stars exclusively for the Fried Chicken & Waffle Breakfast Burrito. It also has scrambled eggs, bacon, and maple bacon dripped inside of it in addition to the chicken and waffles, so it was surprisingly filling and tasty for just over $10 after tax.  Given the giant lineup at the neighbouring Tim Hortons versus how quickly I was ordering and eating, for the early morning factor I'm a fan of this."}
{"text":"I will forgive the slow pace in service as this joint is quite new. I tried two burritos here (chicken and steak) and was really disappointed. Both burritos were quite dry and lacked failed to match the quality of the burrito joints that we have in Toronto. Furthermore the burrito was not filling at all."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy waiting 20min for the worst burrito of your life? Well boy do I have news for you! So, it's a burrito place in an airport, wasn't expecting 5 stars. Two people working, one person takes your order and then another puts the cold toppings on and panini presses it. Girl taking the order takes 5 people's orders then makes the hot portion of the burritos. Problem here is she works at a snails pace, goes into the back for minutes at a time and forgets what she went back for. I grabbed a soda when I was 4 people away from the register and by the time I got my burrito the soda was warm. Nothing here is remotely Mexican in flavor. I asked for hot sauce and got frank's hot sauce smothered all over it. They have guac on the menu but they didn't have it, same for jalapeños. This place was straight up nasty, slow and not worth the time wasted."}
{"text":"Smokes Burritorie is having their grand opening today. They are offering $1 burritos.\"The toppings sound pretty typical for a burrito joint and include rice, refried beans, chorizo and pulled pork. All proceeds from the $1 wraps will go towards The Donkey Sanctuary, a 100-acre safe haven for neglected donkeys located in Guelph, Ontario.\" (BlogTO) Visit the website for the Donkey Sanctuary: http://www.thedonkeysanctuary.ca/  This place used to be the Burrito Boyz, but they moved a few doors west. Now Smoke's Burritorie is right below/beside Smoke's Poutinerie. I think Burrito Boyz has some competition. Although the $1 burrito offer was pretty sweet, the line up took forever, but the upside is that they did come out to give us some nacho chips and salsa which was a nice gesture.   I am sure the quality of the burrito was not up to their standards since they were just pumping out burritos like it was an Asian sweatshop factory (BTW no Asian workers). I will revisit to see if they quality is as great as their poutines are when they are working a normal lunch or dinner rush. Each burrito goes from $7.50 - $9.00 or you can go for a naked bowl for $9.00. Pretty standard prices for the entertainment district. They have different burrito options such as Chicken, Pork, Steak, and Veggie. I had the Steak burrito (El Gran Toro aka The Big Bull) and was impressed with how filling and flavorful the burrito was. It had Marinated Flat Iron Steak, Lime Cilantro Rice, Smoke's Refried Beans, Sweet Corn, Salsa, Crispy Onions, Crisp Lettuce, Citrus Slaw, Sour Cream, Fresh Jalapenos, and House Guac. Look at those ingredients baby!! Only issue was, I felt they could have grilled it a bit better on both sides as only one side had grill marks, and you gotta have that crisp bite when you eat a burrito. Am I right, or am I right? Hope to give an update soon to see if it is worthy of a 5 star. Jimstar Out!!"}
{"text":"Despite my disastrous experience last time, I knew I'd be returning to Smoke's Burritorie when they added \"wacky burritos\" to their menu - including chicken and waffles and pad thai. I opted for the latter and waited a few minutes while the sole employee prepared my burrito. (Like last time, the joint was absolutely empty.)  Another primary reason I decided to come back was the much ballyhooed sauce bar, which is supposed to contain 20 different sauces ranging from coconut curry to mango pineapple. When I arrived, though, I noticed that there were only five sauces up for offer. Fine, I thought. Five is better than nothing. I went to try a couple of them and they were empty. They were *all* empty. Really, Smoke's? Really??  Anyway, the burrito. It was handed to me fairly quickly and I excitedly took it back to my table. My excitement evaporated after the first bite. Imagine the absolute worst pad thai you've ever eaten and then imagine it crammed into a soggy burrito. The predominant taste was pure sweetness, with the occasional bite of cilantro. And there wasn't even a hint of heat present. I wanted to add hot sauce, but the sauce bar was (obviously) not an option and the dude who made my food disappeared into the back the second he finished making my food.  What a complete trainwreck this place is. The mere fact that it's still open despite other, better options in the neighborhood is absolutely mind-boggling."}
{"text":"Not the best, but beggars can't be choosers when you're on an airport food hunt. Happy this was at least an option for travellers, but for the price, I expect a bit more protein in my bowl."}
{"text":"When I saw this place, I was super excited to try their burrito bowls. For $7.49 you can't go wrong. I ordered a veggie bowl, with cilantro rice, black beans, refried beans, lettuce, salsa, corn, coleslaw and avocado from a squirt bottle. Yes a squirt bottle. I questioned the quality of the ingredients after I saw that.  I took it to go. By the time I was able to sit down to eat it, all the ingredients were sloppy. Not so fresh after all.   I still enjoy smoke's poutinerie, but not their burritorie."}
{"text":"It's a fast food place with good prices in Pearson Airport but I found that the food wasn't very fresh at all. Everything at the preparation counter had the appearance that it had been sitting  there for a while.   We had a burrito bowl. While the bowl itself is large, generally they don't fill it up much so to get value you'll need to ask for extra rice and beans as filler or be disappointed about your 7.49 purchase. Sour cream bottle top had a fancy tri-squirt top to make the bowl look Instagram perfect. Guacamole is free, but cheese and extra meat are extra.   Ultimately I think this place is ok, if only because there isn't a Chipotle in the airport."}
{"text":"Veggie signature burrito was bland and dry. Lots of rice filler. Paid extra for guacamole and habanero cheese and can't really detect either. Pricier than Burrito Boyz next door.  Asked for hot sauce as well and could not taste any heat.  Willing to give it another shot in a couple months though. Was hopeful about a Boyz/Bandidos alternative in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty decent burritos but the two times I've been at the airport location the girls are the worst. They seem so unhappy and are not all interested in making burritos. They seriously need a tune up."}
{"text":"Honestly my favourite burritos in Toronto. So many different topping and sauce options, and as someone who isn't a fan of cilantro, I appreciate the spicy rice option.   Staff are efficient and always friendly despite the long lines of loud obnoxious drunk people on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Hot Sauce Challenge, Chicken Waffle Burrito, Pad Thai Burrito, Spaghetti & Meatballs Burrito, and of course,  Poutine Burrito - Smoke's has finally delivered on their burrito legacy.   Smoke's Burritorie has stepped up to the plate and delivered on their brand by relaunching with a new menu. Once you enter, the decor has noticeably changed to reflect this; nice new lamps and most notably a wall for their new sauce bar (20 to choose from like coconut curry, mango pineapple, Frank's, etc.).    The hot sauce challenge is apparently 2.000.000!!!! Scoville and they have a fun alarm for those that go for it. Other new menu additions are the ones mentioned at the top, in addition to the Burrito cigars (cute mini burritos).   Onto the burritos...  First up: Pad Thai! It's pretty simple - it's essentially pad Thai (chicken or shrimp) in a Burrito. Definitely different at first, but it's actually pretty good and is quite filling.  Second up: Chicken waffle! Chicken, waffle, bacon, eggs, syrup--mmmmmmmmmmm. What a treat. Actually very delicious and seems to be the fan favorite. The sweet syrup can come on heavy towards the end though.  Third up (I'm a pig): Spaghetti & Meatballs. I know you're thinking wtf spaghetti??? But it's legitimately good spaghetti with the only caveat that it comes in a burrito. Interesting to say the least.   I hear they're going to unleash some new burritos here and there and I'm very excited. Happy to see something new and tasty although I'm still more of a fan of the glazed yams."}
{"text":"Smoke's Poutinere attempted to break into the burrito market and failed miserably. Since today is their grand opening (the burritorie is just underneath the poutinere), all burritos were $1.00. There are 2 sizes, grande for $7.49 and mucho grande is $8.99. They have the usual offerings: chicken, pulled pork, steak and veggie. Where they differ from Burrito Boyz is that their burritos come with their own set of predetermined fillings (if you want to create your own burrito, it's $0.50 extra). The girl who worked there said that the topping combinations were tested in their lab kitchen and promised that it is better than Buritto Boyz - Ha! I had the steak burrito and as seen in the picture below, the majority of the filling was white rice. The menu said that it's supposed to be cilantro lime rice, but it tasted like plain steamed rice to me. The steak was more like beef jerky, flavourless, dry and crumbly. It was a complete disappointment! If you want to spend money on a quality burrito, go to Burrito Boyz a few doors down. One last thing - they don't have a flat stove top to heat up burritos in bulk, but rather 2 panini presses that can make 6 burritos at a time. This place is a waste of time and money!!"}
{"text":"Normally I'm not even slightly a fan of Smoke's Poutinerie (cold fries) but the Chicken & Waffles Burrito was AWESOME. I hope it stays on the permanent menu. And unlike the poutines that make up for quality with volume, this was on the slightly smallish side so I didn't feel like I just had a massive, unhealthy lunch."}
{"text":"Good deal on the children's burritos.  3 tiny ones for a reasonable price, but they are very very plain.  Only meat and cheese.  Impressive that they can roll those burros so small."}
{"text":"Baffled by why this place is judged so harshly- stopped in late one night with my nephew, ordered the chorizo burrito- fantastic! Flavourful,  moist with lots of meat, reheated leftover for breakfast the next morning, absolutely delicious and not at all soggy..Burrito Boyz nowhere as good, unless you prefer soggy sour cream drenched wraps"}
