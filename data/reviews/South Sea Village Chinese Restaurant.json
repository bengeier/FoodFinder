{"text":"My family and I had dinner here last week.  The fried rice was really tasty.  I usually find fried rice at most places a little too sticky or greasy, but it was really good here.  We also had the green veggies, Sweet and Sour pork and white chicken and those were quite tasty as well. 

I heard that this place was under new management.  The staff is really nice."}
{"text":"This place had huge shoes to fill when it's predecessor, the infamous Chicken & Noodles, left the building.

We ordered a selection of items including a Tofu Casserole, Salt and Chili Pork Chops, Bok Choy with Garlic, Chicken Chow Mein, and a fried Chicken number, things we used to order at Chicken & Noodles.

The food was lackluster. Not a lot of flavour, and there was no bottle of chili oil on the table :( The Bok Choy was my favourite dish, but probably the easiest to execute correctly.

Sadly, this place won't be replacing Chicken & Noodles for me. Still on the hunt for quality cheap and cheerful Chinese fair on the east end."}
{"text":"Since the owners have changed a few months ago, I would say the food is pretty good.  I had their sweet and sour pork, steamed fish, and bak choi, all were impressive for the price you are paying.  There are lunch specials that ranges between 3.50 - 7 dollars.  A lot of different set dinner specials.  Worth trying!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner at the recommendation of my MIL. We arrived at 6:30pm on a Sunday night and the place was 80% full. We managed to get a seat but didn't get our menus or the rest of our place settings for a good 5 min.

Like the previous congee restaurant that used to be here, this place is very drafty. They have a tank of live fish and one of crab. unfortunately for us, they only had one high chair which was already being used by another table. Thankfully we got it halfway through our meal.

My MIL ordered from the set menu (which is written in Chinese). You order two dishes from the list, plus a steamed fish for a low price. We ordered: steamed chicken, beef with mushrooms and added a plate of Chinese veg. We later added a roast pigeon (only $7 if you order a minimum of $25). 

Free soup to start (carrot and lotus root) which I appreciate. Beef with mushroom had excellent \"wok hei\". Fish was fresh and delicious. Chicken was just ok and same with the pigeon (it didn't have the beautiful dark brown colour to the crispy skin and it was slightly under-seasoned). The vegetables were a decent portion. Complimentary red bean soup. Our bill was $50, great price!

The tables around us seemed to be enjoying their dishes. Saw many orders of steamed shrimp with head-on which I'll have to try next time. 

Service is just so-so because they are SO incredibly busy but at least they are trying! My two girls got fortune cookies which kept them happy."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with friends.  We got the beef fried noodles, lobster, roasted chicken and the eggplant dish.  The beef fried noodles were really tasty.  The roasted chicken wasn't greasy and tasted really good.  Although it was okay, the eggplant is one I'm always torn about because i can't seem to find one that's as good as the ones in China.

There is parking available for free.  Dinner dishes are around $7 and up.  I heard lunch was pretty cheap though.

There's isn't much in ambiance, but there's plenty of seating and the food is good."}
{"text":"This place has been here for years, however I think it's changed ownership since the last time I came here.

There's a selection of foods they have available, like most chinese restaurants.  
Their overall rating based on taste, presentation, cleanliness, and price was about a 4/5.  Though this is not your fancy chinese restaurant, its does the chore.

Notables:

Sweet beef tenderloin with sautee mushrooms was pure delish!!  

Beef brisket in a hot pot, juicy pieces of brisket, with mellon, preserved tofu, simmered in broth was delicious!

General Tao Chicken, not overly sweet, but perfect balance of flavors, the chicken was tender, and marinted well, NOT JUST FRIED, MIXED WITH THE SAUCE AND SERVED!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since they changed ownership. Every time I come here I feel like I'm going to a relative's place to eat. The male server treats me like a daughter and asks me how the food is, if I need more tea, more dessert? It's always nice to feel welcomed at a restaurant. So that's were the extra star comes into play.

Food wise I would say its a 3. Nothing extraordinarily good but it doesn't taste bad. They aren't heavy with msg so that's a huge bonus. 

Free soup and dessert with every meal!"}
{"text":"So how is South Sea Village After 10 months since their grand opening?

The lunch menu does have a good selection of Cantonese dishes includes stir fried noodles, rice dishes and soup noodle dish.

My Beef with Rice Noodle ($5.99) comes with a choice of drink was nicely done with fresh from the wok taste. The only problem is the HK style milk tea, it tasted like milk water! I had a sip and I just could not drink it....

Definitely don't sit at those booth no matter how tempting they look on a cold winter day... Trust me.... unless you want to have your winter jacket on while you eat your food!"}
{"text":"As some may be aware, Chicken & Noodle Chinese Restaurant is no more. 

So what happened? Fairly straightforward scenario: Owner retired, sold off the business to former employees, restaurant got reworked from there, and reopened sometime near the end of March. 

So what's changed? Quite a bit, or at least whatever the domains of what your average Chinese seafood restaurant would look like, except maybe being smaller. That, and pretty much every dish with shredded chicken gone, which while I was not surprised, felt a bit sad to know that shredded chicken fried noodles is amongst the chopping block. Luckily, they did have shredded meat (pork) fried noodles, along with the fact that the noodles haven't changed, since most of the staff have stayed, so that will do. You also get soup and desserts now, so that's also quite nice.

Overall, even though the place has gone a massive facelift to say the least, some of the things that made the old restaurant what it was is still there, and I'm okay with this, considering a lot of my favourite restaurants have been disappearing over the last few years."}
