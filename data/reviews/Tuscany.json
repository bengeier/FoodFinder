{"text":"The new menu has something for everyone. Good ingredients at prices equal to or better the the other local chains.  Great happy hour dinner deals at the bar for those looking to save money."}
{"text":"You'll have to take this review with a grain of salt, because I'm grading the lunch menu while eating at the bar.  I'm sure the dinner menu & service would be great, but the lunch staff wasn't.  My wife & I had to sit and the bar and tell the waitress we were ready to eat.   Once the food came, my chicken pesto sandwich was good, but my wife's salad was a big chunk of feta cheese.  I'm pretty sure the \"diet coke\" was actually real coke, & the total bill was $30 for 2 people.  A little steep for an average lunch with average service.  Recommendation:  check out the dinner scene."}
{"text":"The service here was pretty good.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive, and when we asked her if one of the dishes was spicy, she took the liberty to go into the kitchen and verify for us.

The food here - not so good.  At first glance, the menu seems like very typical, not too creative Italian fare.  We had the calamari, italian wedding soup and the fettucini con carciofi.  I really hate to say this, but the calamari we had was probably the worst calamari I've ever had in my life.  The whole thing was breaded incorrectly and it tasted very doughy.  The italian wedding soup was okay, but it lacked meat and the acini de pepe (the little pasta balls that are typical to the soup) were in big clumps, as if they just dumped the package into the soup and did not bother to stir it up.  And lastly, the fettucini was cooked all the way through but it was extremely bland - there was no salt at the table so I ended up dumping copious amounts of parmesan cheese over the dish in an attempt to rescue the flavor."}
