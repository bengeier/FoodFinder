{"text":"I took my 89 year old grandmother (who we call Bubbie) here for brunch yesterday.  She loved it and that's all that matters.  Daniel B. is correct about the Jewish part, though you can also be from other areas of the city, aside from Thornhill!  The decor is nothing fancy and the idea is that you don't spend a tremendous amount of time there.  They do have an outdoor patio.  The menu is quite large and in addition to all the egg options you have, you can also build your own omelette.  I didn't feel like building yesterday morning, so I ordered the asparagus and brie omelette.  It was delicious with my toasted whole wheat twister bagel and endless refills of coffee.  I do think that there were a lot of eggs in it though...  You also have all the other standards: scoops of tuna and egg, cream cheese, salads, lox, and BAGELS!  One of the best parts, aside from my grandmother being very happy and loving her cheddar omelette, was the server.  She was absolutely hilarious and I would go back just to have her as my server again.    Then when you are done and are paying up at the front counter, you can wander into the bakery side and load up on danishes, cookies, breads, bagels, etc.    I am rarely up at Bathurst and Steeles, but it was worth it.  Especially to eat there with my Bubbie :)"}
{"text":"Yum! Favorite place to go as a kid for breakfast!!  Everything on the menu is delish!"}
{"text":"If you want meat for breakfast-it's not your place. If you want a quite place and immediate sitting- it's not your place.  If you want an exceptional Israeli breakfast and great people around you, go! I love everything about them. Do you remember the old lady, the waitress? The best! I do feel for girls serving us at Kiva, we are nor very easy customers.Tip them better. Not ONCE I had any stomach trouble or my picky kid would complaint about the food. Coffee is fresh, eggs are perfect ( yes, you can screw eggs, try Newmarket and Aurora for breakfast) and the bagels are song! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Kiva's serves good food at reasonable prices AND it's kosher. At least I think it's kosher ... I'm not Jewish, so what do I know from kosher? The service is generally pretty good, but they can get a little overwhelmed some days. Nonetheless, there's definitely a reason for the line-ups here."}
{"text":"i've been going to Kiva's every weekend since i moved into the neighbourhood 15 years ago. i've now moved far away, and the only thing i miss is Kiva's. their cream cheese and lox on a twister, can fill you up for the day. they have freshly squeezed orange juice, a little expensive, but oh so worth it. and my absolute favorite, their apple strudel. writing this review is making me homesick, but just for Kiva's menu.  P.S. also i suggest the spinach salad, or the cheese blintzes."}
{"text":"This is a local staple for the older Jewish crowd. In short, the Omelettes are amazing!! You can also create your own, I had an egg-white omelette with Spinach, avocado and onion and it was fantastic. The bagels are pretty fresh so that's nice.  The service is really awful. They don't listen properly and so every time I've been there they get something wrong on our order. The place is always packed, if you want brunch go really early morning. It is also a much older place so everything is a little run down.  Go for a quick omelette with a friend early morning and it'll be great. Any other expectations you have watch out."}
{"text":"Food was edible but relatively blend. The service was ok to slightly mediocre, but we were seated at the counter so we may not have had the best place for the best service. The way they place order is archaic and can lead to order mistakes and order deliver not all at once. I did like that it was a family business."}
{"text":"Kiva's is something of an institution in Thornhill and has been serving bagels for decades.  I used to go here all the time while I was in high school and my family still gets their weekend bagels from here.  The bagel style is not Montreal style - but it's not typical Toronto-style either.  The bagels are quite dense and doughy, but delicious.   I recommend trying the bigger bagel twisters if you're hungry.  You can get a bagel to go - or you can sit in their dining room which is basic and reminds me of a 60s diner that's been updated.    Kivas had a change in management many years back - and they have done a great job stepping up the menu and food a few notches.  This is a Jewish bagel deli.  I'm not sure many of these exist anymore."}
{"text":"There are simply no other bagels on the planet that compare to Kiva's. Just go."}
{"text":"Cream cheese and lox on a poppy seed twister... Hands down the best I've ever tasted!!!"}
{"text":"Nice lunch with the family.  Very casual atmosphere.  They were quite busy and we walked in needing a table for 11 people.  Had to wait about 20-30 minutes to be seated but with such a large group on a busy day, it was expected.   I ordered Shakshuka (a traditional Israeli breakfast dish) and was pleasantly surprised with how spicy it was.   No complaints about their coffee, I had a few cups!  Their bagels are great too (they even have really tasty gluten-free options).   Make sure to pop into the bakery on your way out and grab some delicious treats for the afternoon!"}
{"text":"The best bagels in Canada... if you like Montreal bagels then go to Montreal, but if you like good bagels then Kiva's is the place for you. Everything on the menu is great, but grab some food for later on your way out too (I recommend a twister). Service is a bit slow some times, but mostly because the old Jewish customers monopolize the staff's time by telling them about their grandson in law school."}
{"text":"Recently I heard that Kiva's had opened a new location somewhere on St. Clair and thank goodness because I grew up eating Kiva's bagels, but the trek up to edge of Toronto is well, quite frankly, a little too far for a bagel.   These are NOT Montreal styled bagels, they ARE (when fresh) very very very good (typically less chewy, with a hard crust and soft doughy middle).  But be warned, this location sits at the ageing intersection of Bathurst and Steeles, so the crowd is more bubbie/zadie than hip/metropolitan. This can be an advantage though if you're looking some good home-style Jewish classics like blitzes (eggy crepes rolled around ricotta cheese and topped with berries) or the ever popular bagel, cream cheese, lox platter.  Anyways, cheers to the new location, now do you think we could get some bagels south of Bloor? Seriously??"}
{"text":"This place has been around my block for over 20 years and I had to see how is it still in business?  I have tried the bagels once upon a time and they were way too hard.   I went in to eat with a friend and the server was nice and friendly.   The bagels were still hard, even though I can make a delicious tuna and egg salad (unlike the rest of the people who go here) I did try it and it was horrible, dry and tasteless .  Scramble eggs were ah nothing special and the salad was just a salad with no special flavours.  Very disappointed,  and now in know why it took me over 20 years to go in here.  And for the people who crave cheese and lox, go buy some, you don't have to go get it here on a hard bagel twist."}
{"text":"My family and I used to come here almost every weekend for breaky.  Simple breakfast and illy coffee.. Reasonable price,  some times the service is shoty.  I so wished bacon/pork was kosher cause breakfast without bacon is not the same."}
{"text":"Between meetings one afternoon I decided to go to Kiva's for lunch. I arrived right at noon. I was seated quickly. The clientele is an interesting mix of mommy groups, seniors and people popping in for a quick bite. By far he time I left the place was packed with a lineup to be seated.   I ordered a coffee and the Avocado salad which comes with a bagel. A tasty salad."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with the food but no one knows how to listen here. I have not eaten here for over a year because you're ago at the exact same experience never got what I asked for. There must be a ration on butter. Ask for  bagel well buttered and you're lucky to get enough butter to cover a cracker. Good bagels to take home but don't waste your time or energy eating here unless your a senior on medication and you don't know what day it is time it is or how you got there."}
{"text":"Oy vey, jewish style breakfast. Family style. Very nice place. I am definitely a regular there."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the reviews on customer relations. Hit and miss.   I am craving for cream cheese and lox on sesame.   Just got it. Wanted something plain and hearty.   No nonsense ordering. Go in and out, at least for this shop.   Hmm, like I said, I was craving for lox, and the taste is all right, hence the three-star. I think I will be back, if I'm in the area, if I have a big craving for it."}
{"text":"A good place for breakfast...it's really too bad it's far (ish) from the city's core. Coming from Montreal I have a strong biase concerning the bagels, but I definitely enjoyed kiva's bagels. It's good to see they're not trying to copy Montreal but do their own thing instead.  If you're up in North York, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"The reason for the one star is simple: management attitude. I ordered a flat toasted bagel with cream cheese (with chives). What I  got was a bagel and cream cheese with green onions. I called over the waitress and mentioned it, and she quickly returned with the same offering saying that this was how \"the kitchen\" served this item. She suggested I speak to the manager/owner on my way out.  After paying I did speak to the manager. He said he knew the menu said chives but that was just \"lingo\", as \"green onions would not sell as well\". I told him that it was  not correct but he dismissively said \"we can get away with it\". That is stunning disregard for your patrons, and knocks down their rating to 1 star.  This is a dairy restaurant catering to a lot of people following dietary laws. One cannot but wonder what other liberties they take with the lingo in the menu....or in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Very simple taste and no meat selection for breakfast menu.  Understandable considering the ethnic/cultural background but lack of attention from the servers where managers had to step in to address our issues couple of times for not being attended to for far too long. Great managers, poor staff, mediocre good."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is amazing!   Was taking a friend to the doctors in the area and found this little gem.   Authentic Jewish bagels hand rolled and then KETTLE boiled! The right way, no additives or preservatives, nothing else, all natural!   To go along with that they have gluten free bagels! And a tonne of sugar free sweets for the diabetic in your family or if you just want to cut back on the sugar.   They make everything in house and haven't changed their recipes according to the owner since they first opened in 1979!   There was a line up out the door for the restaurant come lunch time and everyone seated seemed to have huge portions.   I'd say if you're in the area give this place a try."}
{"text":"Came for the Sunday breakfast. Service is efficient and friendly. Can't say I was a fan of the eggs and lox. Ms. Brooks Brothers had the goat cheese and red pepper omelet and it was fantastic. You won't find any bacon or sausage on the menu here, being it's Kosher. I think I'll stick with treif breakfast dining."}
{"text":"Kiva's is a family run breakfast joint that is an institution in Thornhill. For those who know \"What a Bagel\", it's more or less a smaller competitor.   They bake freak bagels and desserts and have a nice restaurant portion with ample seating - but be careful, there are line ups on the weekends.   Their menu is robust offering lots of variety to choose from. Their cream cheese is amazing, eggs perfectly cooked on each occasion, bagels that are perfectly cooked.   Service is spot on and the owner Steve - he's a great guy.   All in all a wonderful experience and meal.   I personally enjoy their platter which is served with a bagel (but I'd upgrade to the twister), egg salad, and some cucumbers, tomato and onions. You can add the lox as well which is fresh and delicious.   Definitely a great spot to enjoy a decent breakfast!"}
{"text":"Work across the street from Kiva's- they have the best macaroons and treats! :) service is always very friendly"}
{"text":"Ahhhh what can I say about Kivas?? I've been coming here since I was a little kid. With visions of twister bagels, Lox and cream cheese in my head. Um (clears throat) okay I'm back.., always fresh, wonderful service. They have so much variety to choose from. My kids love all their treats especially their cookies. I will always be a regular here till my dying day."}
{"text":"Located in the far north of the city, Kivas is the kind of place where everybody knows your name.   Unless you're not Jewish and from Thornhill, in which case nobody at all will have any clue who you are.   An all dairy menu.   Bottomless coffee.  It's changed owners over the years, but the exact same people are in the restaurant every single day."}
{"text":"Oy do I crave a poppy seed twister bagel with cream cheese and lox!! They're coffee's not so hot, but big deal; there are plenty of coffee shops around. Eat here! Try their baked goods: ruggulach, challah to take home, cookies and so on. Yummy!  The other reviewer, Sheldon G is right: \"just go\"!"}
{"text":"Kiva's is an awesome place for breakfast and lunch. Service could be better and the place could be less packed, but you can't control that sometimes.  Three Eggs Sunny Side up, toast and potatoes. Solid meal.  Awesome price.  The bakery is phenomenal, check them out. Bring Cash, it will make your life easier."}
{"text":"A good shtikkel bagel, no doubt about it.  Having said that, my personal taste leans more to the Montreal-style bagels, but this place is OK with me, except that the whole-wheat bagels with sesame were a bit hard when I got them yesterday ... (just sayin') ...   They have a huge array of sweet baked goods.  Nutella-filled shortbread ... mmmm ... tons of other gorgeous-looking sweet things.  I even bought alfajores here once and they were divine.  They have cheese-filled blintzes.  Busy place, fairly loud decibel level.  Not a place to be calorie-conscious ...  Next time I'll go for the regular bagels (not whole-wheat), i.e. the real thing (bagels, like pasta, should not be whole-wheat) ..."}
{"text":"Was going to get bagels, but saw a cockroach crawling down the front of the bagel window. I left. I was disappointed, because I really used to like Kiva's."}
{"text":"Hmm. Where do I start. I felt there was a lack of service when I came here. The bagels were hard and at a premium price felt they were not upto par. I recommend if you want great fresh bagels try the bagel nash!"}
{"text":"Kiva's Bagel Bakery and Restaurant really have 2 set of doors... one leading to the bakery itself... the other to the restaurant itself.  I am surprise when this location suppose to be new... since the deco is plain and feels dated.  I would just suggest to just get the bagel and run and go home and do whatever with it... I was in shock when my Pumpernickel Bagel toasted with cream cheese cost $4.99!! While a twisted bagel cost $1....   To be fair, the bagel tasted mighty good!! just crispy outside and chewy inside... and loaded with really light cream cheese. Carb Heaven!!  The sweet selections are really interesting too... Alfajores looks tempting and delicious and mighty sugar which I will try it next time when I visit!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Been there only once but excellent place to eat. Everyone was friendly (staff and patrons alike)."}
