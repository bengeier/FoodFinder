{"text":"Mandarin restaurant is great especially if you like seafoods. Thumb ups. But there's alot of different food so we enjoyed dining here"}
{"text":"They did a wonderful job on the renovations! It's beautiful inside. Great, friendly staff. My boyfriend and I go strictly for the crab legs! Amazing price for all you can eat crab!"}
{"text":"Went here today with a bunch of other colleagues.  My first time ever experiencing a buffet of this variety, and was happy to be there.  Available are a huge variety of Asian foods, and worse they had western foods like french fries, chicken wings, and penne.  The sushi was one of the biggest let downs.  Displayed are gorgeous rows of sliced fish behind a glass case, none of the which are actually used in the sushi.  Available was a seaweed roll, California rolls, and two other chicken sushi rolls; One fried and one flavoured with maple.  The word here was DISGUSTING.  Everything else seemed pretty standard until the dessert.  Again they had a huge variety which I won't get into, but none of them tasted fresh, I am sorry to say.  The cream puffs tasted freezer burnt, and the chocolate squares were nothing to scream about.

The WORST thing about this place is....THE SERVICE.  Our drinks took 45 minutes to come to the table, and was another 45 minutes before we had to track someone down to fill our water glasses.  Guess they don't like keeping track of orders here because my colleagues were made to pay for their warm drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) up front before paying for their meals.

I am sorry, but I find this ruins the whole experience having to pay for a part of your meal throughout the service, and were also told it was cash only for the beverages.  Sounds a little sketchy to me.....

On top of that, the waiter expected us all to pay on one bill.  I argued with him considering we are all adults, have work and families to go to, and were respectively leaving at different times, and some of us were not even finished our meals.
He then demanded that we all pay either at that moment or at the end of the meal.
This did not make us happy.  AT ALL.

Who pays halfway through their meal?

Several of us paid in cash, which he took several twenty dollar bills away in a basket (after tax came to 16.94/ person), and never returned with their change.  When I managed to find him to pay for my plate, I demanded my change and receipt immediately as I noticed he had not giving anyone their change or a receipt.  He briskly walked away from me, and did not return for 10 minutes.  I handed him my cash, and he took another five minutes to come back with my change.

Food was okay, but the service totally ruined the experience for me.  I will not recommend this particular location to anyone.  The older staff are EXTREMELY rude, and dismissive.  

Will NEVER be going back here again."}
{"text":"Great place to overspend and over eat. 
If you are already obese this place will keep you that way. If you only have $65.00 for groceries this week the two of you can blow it here in 20 minutes. Even the seemingly healthy choices are doused in sugary sauces or jarred industrial goo from China. As you rinse your palate of the sticky greasy stuff your belly gets full with water. They have agents standing by watching the levels in your glass and they top it up constantly which comes in handy if you're conversation needs to be inadvertently broken up. Not only do you eat less the digestive acids in your stomach become diluted with water which is why you feel bloated hours after.  It's a once in a lifetime experience!"}
{"text":"Mandarin Restaurant is great if you're in the mood for a variety and can't decide on one theme... Canadian-Chinese dishes, prime rib, grilled meats, sushi bar, great salad bar and lots of deserts to drool over.

This location is much more guest-friendly... I visited the North York location and had to wait to be seated in an empty restaurant... this location seats you quickly, the servers are ready to clear your table when done, bring your drinks quickly and always with a sincere smile."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and not bad still lots of choices but not like the other location in Brampton that I went to. Maybe just because of the lunch menu versus the dinner menu? But food was good and service was good!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch for Mandarin with a few colleagues today.  When we walked in, I did not realize that they had holiday buffet prices, which was $5.00 more.  It was packed for a Monday, despite the busyness we were seated right away.

They had a descent salad bar and abundant amount of hot food.  They have the Canadian Chinese food fare as well as pizza, a grill station and sushi!  If you have a sweet tooth, save room for dessert - there are two sections!

Mandarin is great for groups with various palettes."}
{"text":"A mildly popular place.. The food is average and it's not a nice enough place to bother staying to eat there. The buffet is about what you'd expect from a chain restaurant so there is nothing special or particularly ethnic."}
{"text":"I will be very hard pressed to come back. The food is not enough to overcome the unsavoury clientele that always appears to be present at this location. I suppose the old adage location, location, location truly applies here. If it's not college students wanting to fight middle aged people, or very visible thugs trying to get out of their bills by complaining about absolutely everything (how can you possibly complain about the water not being filled quick enough at a Mandarin?!? As soon as you put the glass to your mouth, you can see a server running to get the water pitcher!) I will not come back. Not even a \"free\" visit would entice me. If eating in uncomfortable environments is your thing, then this is the restaurant for you! Not for my family or I."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner buffet. Had to say that their service is much better compared to other Chinese / Japanese buffets. Upon check-in, the waitress friendly greeted us, showed us their daily specials and where they were, and the way to the washrooms.

Before and after the meal, they also served us hot hand towels, very thoughtful. One star for the great service.

The food was ok, good enough for a buffet restaurant. Like their fried thin noodles and grilled salmon. Desserts were yum too."}
{"text":"Did take out which consisted of a combination. Had chicken balls, chicken fried or should I say BURNT rice, beef with almonds swimming in sauce. Called to complain because the chicken balls were fried burnt as well. The owner has the audacity to tell me that no one else has complaint all evening! Not my problem. Cook your food properly. See the pic. Don't eat here, your better off eating at McDonald's"}
{"text":"I thought to give this place a try since im in town.
I ended up regreting it. The foods are so so, either too sweet or too overcooked. I wouldnt return here"}
{"text":"Everyone knows The Mandarin. 

Most of us have been at least once. I go about once a year because it's my mom's favourite so although I probably would not go here on my own free will, I have a lot of great family memories here. That alone makes it an A-Ok place in my books. 

But I have to say, the food has really improved over the years. Most people's aversion to the all you can eat Canadian style Asian food chain is the guilt and remorse you feel after eating way too much fried and sweet food. Well, I'm saying if you have the will power to pass on the chicken balls and spring rolls and all those gooey desserts, you CAN have a nice somewhat healthy meal here. You just need to make the right choices. 

To help you, they now have calorie counts on each dish. If anything, these can act as a deterrent from temptation. All you really need is to stick to veggies and roasted or baked meat and fish. Vegetarian proteins are also available if that's your thing. Plenty of good quality fresh fruit offerings and refreshing sherbets for after. So there you go. It is possible to keep to your diet if you are ever invited to a Mandarin Party. Go for it! 

If you do happen to enjoy a big old plate of General Tao Chicken there's that, too (and much, much more!!)"}
{"text":"Went to Mandarin with family before driving up the ski resort. We arrived about 45 minutes before lunch time closing and it was rushed but we were also in a rush so it worked well.
The choices are plentiful and had some really tasty dishes, including some surprising like holiday favorites. Sushi was good but they didn't have any spicy sushi which the family really likes. The kids in particular were fans of the deserts they went back multiple times.
Solid place and would go back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday after a family event. It was a pretty big group of us, they had no problem finding us seating  right away. The service was not bad. The food was...mandarin quality food:) although I found that at this location they had more variety like meatballs, and penne? First time Iv seen that at a mandarine. 

They have one huge salad bar, 2 tables for hot food, and 2 very long dessert tables. Go figure. When it was time to pay there was no confusion with bills, it came up to $17 per person. Although we had to wait a little bit for our hot hand towels. I'm not sure if I'm the only one who notices that every time anybody eats mandarine they get the \"itis\"? They must put something in the food, I am convinced."}
{"text":"It sucks since they ended the crab legs. Will never go back . They lost a lot of our friends as well. They might as well close down and go back China
."}
{"text":"Was happy to finally get some decently delicious Asian food from this area. Although westernized, it's basic enough and was easy to order takeout. Get the chicken balls! The chow mein toppings and veggies were delicious as was the sauce but the noodles were bland and overcooked so I mainly munched on the veggies. I recommend this if you're in the area and looking for something quick and simple with a little Asian flare. The interior of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. The buffet looked beautiful as well but I didn't eat at the c restaurant so I can't vouch for the freshness and flavor there. I also appreciate that they make your takeout food to order."}
{"text":"We have been to this location many times before. They are a decent Mandarin Buffet location.  Today we were here for my youngest daughter's birthday. I won't rate the food. It was as good as this chain's buffet locations usually are. Instead, I'll rate the service. On service, they were 5 star today. They carefully checked out our 3 groups and who was paying for what, how many children, how many seniors. They saw we had a birthday cake, confirmed it was a birthday and whose, and offered to refrigerate the cake. No mistakes, no confusion. They brought the first  two groups' to arrive drinks, had to be reminded to take the 3rd group's drink orders. I give them a pass for that because the waiter wasn't there when the 3rd group arrived.  All our emptied plates were quickly cleared away. I am fussy about my carved roast. They had the lunchtime flank steak at the carvery & there was hardly any left & the remainder looked dried out. So I asked the carver when the new flank steak would arrive. He promised to let me know and he actually came to my table to tell me!  When we asked them to bring out the cake, they did with a lighted candle, brought out a *lucky* Chinese hat for the birthday girl to wear, then took a free group photo. The first photo, part of the birthday girl's face was blocked, so they re-took the photo, no extra charge.  I cannot fault any of this Mandarin's service, it was PERFECT."}
{"text":"This Buffet can barely call itself a Chinese buffet the answer is more North American food than anything else. You know it is a crappy Buffet when the best part is the desert.  The food was all great tasting but very little of it was Chinese food.  We went at lunch and I'm told that is not the best time to visit however a the Chinese buffet should not have crappy torchiere pie and crappy poutine. Or cabbage rolls seriously who likes them."}
{"text":"Judging by the \"Now Open\" sign I saw out front, it looks like this place was recently renovated, and it looks great. Chairs, wall decor, and ceilings were nice and modern (not that Mandarin looked bad before but it looks better now in my opinion).

Walking in, we were greeted by three hostesses who welcomed us in unison. It was almost like a mini choir. What can I say, I'm easily amused.

We were seated in the \"Fish room.\" Aptly named with tasteful (no pun intended) fish decor on the wall plus an aquarium.

Food is pretty much what'd you find at any Mandarin location. No complaints.

Servers were very attentive. Almost a little too attentive at times with their peaking out from behind the server area to check on you. They mean well though.

I don't think I've ever had a bad time at any Mandarin and this one was no exception."}
