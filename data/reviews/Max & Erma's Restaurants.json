{"text":"Pros: Private parking lot, burger, service Cons:   Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes Is it a good choice for big groups? Maybe  This is a past experience review. On Thanksgiving Day around 8:30PM, we did not have so much effort to find a place to leave our car there. The hostess was very friendly and nice and directed us to our table without any need for waiting. Obviously the restaurant was almost empty due to the holiday. The dining room was huge and there is a sundae bar that we got very tempted to eat there after the dinner. The waitress was very nice and friendly and was always checking our table to see if we needed something more. Because we were craving for a burger, my wife and I decided to build our own burger. Overall, the experience was fantastic! The burger was big and juice and not greasy and the fries were delicious too. This is the type of restaurant that I will have as a first option when I go back to the Pittsburgh, PA again."}
{"text":"I was at Max and Erma's this morning on my way to Oakland. My servers name was Michelle.  This was the worst experience I've had at the airport.  Michelle took her time placing our order Ck#8452 and then it took over 20 minutes to get to our table.  Then the order was wrong.  Michelle has the social skills of a ant and that may be giving her to much credit.  Ants know how to work.  I spoke to someone else who travels through cleveland and also told me about poor service.  He discribed the person and it sounded like Michelle.  I paid for a meal that I didn't even have the time to eat and got up from the table hitting my head on the lights over the table.  Michelle had a great time with that.  Customer Service Sucks, and it doesn't stop with Michelle. I would look at the cook as well. It looked like she was sleep walking through the order."}
{"text":"In early July, my family and I arrived in Pittsburgh after a fun-filled long weekend at Geneva-on-the-Lake.  We checked into our hotel in Shadyside, then took a walk.  After 30 or 40 minutes, we were tired and hungry, and though it was a \"funny\" time to eat---about 3 p.m.---we went up the stairs to Max & Erma's.      Our server was perky without overdoing it, and she served us well.  Our meals were all very good. My daughter and I each got a sandwich. She got a turkey one of some sort (I forget its fancy name), and I got the vegetarian sandwich (also had its own title).  We each had a half of one another's. I don't know which sandwich tasted better!         So I'll go back to this place when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Your basic fried stuff and burgers.  Not bad, not good.  Kinda pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"This is a chain, so don't expect somthing fresh, flavorful or in any way unique or exotic.  That said, I like their Buffalo chicken burgers."}
{"text":"Max and Erma's is not the sort of place that you go for fine dining. However, I do have many fond memories of coming here with many good friends and even a few crushes in my early years. If you find yourself hanging out with friends in Shadyside, it's an adequate place to grab a bite to eat. There are definitely some other places in Shadyside that offer better fare, but Max and Erma's is to Shadyside what Eat N' Park is to Squirrel Hill - a basic place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"The 3 course combo is a great deal!!! Cheap filling and downtown. You even get chocolate chip cookies. Sundae bar is still in a BATHTUB-  bring a party- there's room for it and no one here.. people forget about it."}
{"text":"Basic American fare chain restaurant. All about the convenience and standardization at this place. Seems lke I good place to take kids. Think TGI Fridays or Chili's, but somewhat rundown. They have a clown on one of the nights and a magician on another night, and they always have a sundae bar. For some reason I never see any kids there tho. Perhaps there was an incident... or its just my late night eating habits."}
{"text":"I treated my younger sister and kid brother out to dinner , to recognize their high PSSA scores and over all academic success so far this school year.  What can I say the kids just love this place.  For me the food was terrible.  I wouldn't even have cooked this way for an enemy. I got the cabo shrimp salad. This was four tiny dried up shrimp served in a bowl with ice berg lettuce an rotten tomatoes.    The kiddies had Beatlejuices which is grape juice and Sprit with a gummy worms. They also had Oreo milk shakes which they demolished and said were super yummy.  Each of them for dinner also had a cheese burger. The burger was juicy and delicious.   I have to comment on th bathrooms. They are in terrible shape. The toilet paper rolls are broken so instead of fixing the toilet paper rolls Max and Erma's just sit the roll of toilet paper on top of the broken toilet roll. I couldn't believe it!"}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't give a place like Max & Erma's three reviews.  But my husband Rick and I had taken our niece Allison and nephew Brian to the nearby Fort Pitt Museum and this is the closest restaurant that's family friendly.  Allison is now 12 and Brian is now 10, so they're no longer ordering off the kids menu.    So Max & Erma's has enough to keep everyone happy.  It's a place that won't break your budget either."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch, got the black bean veggie burger and side salad.  It was delicious.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow, worst club I've ever had...hilite was the tortilla soup. That was actually edible. Waiting 40 minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable. Especially when we were the 2nd table seated of the day."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a friend and it was good.  The hostess and bartender were great.  They great you with a smile and pleasantly wait on you.  The food is just OK.  The hostess greated us with a smile and mentioned it would be about 15 minutes.  We asked if we could eat at the bar and he said of course.  We found a small booth at the bar.  On our way back we noticed that there were several empty tables available.  We found this strange and that is one reason I gave them 3 stars.  We were greated by the bartender, who was quite nice looking, with a smile.  He had alot of tables and still seemed to manage pouring drinks and delivering food.  He was great at his job.  I ordered tortilla soup and salad with raspberry vinaigrette and it was good, delivered with a smile, and timely.  The bartender kept our drinks full as well.  I would give the service 5 stars, food 3 stars, size of the restaurant is large but they never seem to be staffed for it so that i would give 1 star.  Great place to go for a quick lunch!!"}
{"text":"This review was originally posted in the wrong section - Alaska instead of Cleveland, OH...when I last visited Cleveland a few weeks ago, although my flight departed from Concourse C, I walked over to Concourse A where there was a Great Lakes Brewery...go there for the bier, not the food... If I could rate the place any lower, I would.  Anyhow, here is my submission for the place - bottom line? Stay away...go elsewhere.   Worst restaurant/bar experience in an airport! Cleveland Airport, Concourse C.   What bar runs out of draft bier during a hectic day of delays in an airport caused by high wind gusts? Bud, Bud Light, Sam Adam's Lager...nothing - dry. The only good part to this was that they carried bottles of an Ale from the local brewery, Great Lakes Brewery, a great local brewery in Cleveland.   Not only did they run out of bier, due to staff shortage, my waitress was under tremendous stress - meaning that I waited for what seemed like eternity to finally get my bier, my food - since I did not want to run out of bier, I ordered my second one before my food arrived, without silverware...you figure that the management would discount the biers or food or something, no suck luck.   I had to track my waitress down to get my tab because my plane was boarding...   I would have gone to another bar/restaurant, but the location was convenient, right across my gate.   Needless to say, folks were not too happy, but were happy to be finally flying back home or start their trips - or was it to leave Max & Erma's?   SO, if ever stuck in the Cleveland Hopkins Airport, shuffle on over to Concourse A where Great Lakes Brewery has a bar/restaurant. Best part about that location? Great Lakes bier on tap..."}
{"text":"I have only one thing to say... Garbage Burger. Max and Erma fans know exactly what I'm talking about. When in the burgh go to Max and Erma's for a garbage burger!"}
{"text":"Stopped In before a show at Heinz Hall.  It was not crowded, but the waiter was almost useless.  He did not know the beer list, drinks went unfilled, etc.  Plus I was served teriyaki fajitas.  That's right, these were the oddest fajitas I have ever been served.  The taste was OK, but it is not what I expect fajitas to be.  That said, my wife's Reuben and son's fish and chips were OK.  Overall it was just OK food served by an incompetent waiter."}
{"text":"Decent burgers, ribs and salads.  I like the pretzel and potato skins.  Wings are very small and not worth the price.  Glad to see they extended their closing to 9PM on weekdays.  This chain came from Columbus/Dayton Ohio.  It's been around 30 years.  Menus are standard across the chain.  Their Perks card is a joke.  You have to eat there 10 times or so to get 10% off.  I have always had good service, but then when I have gone the place is empty."}
{"text":"Of all the crazy places in this crazy world, Max and Ermas had superb potstickers, perhaps the best I've ever had.  I was pleased.  I went there a few times, though, and never found an entree I didn't hate.  So I have to give it an uneven rating -- but if you like potstickers, and feel like making a meal of them, you really should try this at least once."}
{"text":"2.5  No veggie burgers?!? The menu was really thin if you don't eat meat. they were able to do the salad with no bacon or chicken, but I was really hoping for a big veggie burger.   If you eat meat, or are not hungry, this is a great place in CLE to get a beer and a snack and watch whatever game is on. Our waitress let us just sit forever and didn't rush us out."}
{"text":"A good bar with OK food.    Fairly diverse menu, so you dont have to have a burger, etc."}
{"text":"Food is okay. I've only came during lunch to this location. If you want fast service sit in the bar area otherwise your time at lunch can easily double."}
{"text":"Yes, Max & Erma's is a chain, but not all are created equal.  The Max & Erma's at 630 Stanwix Street in downtown Pittsburgh is a great place for a casual meal.  They have very good food and service.  If you hit there during rush hour skip the waiting list and go to the bar for faster service. They have great burgers, but I like the choice of a half sandwich and soup or salad.  I also like the frequent diner program, which gives you a 5% discount after eating there about 5 times and a larger discount the more often you eat there.  They also send you specials via e-mail from time to time.  On Wednesdays they give you two free chocolate chip cookies with your meal. On your birthday month they give you six free chocolate chip cookies.  The cookies are usually served hot, right from the kitchen and are delicious. Max & Erma's also has a great bar.  This location is just across the river from PNC Park and Heinz Field.  You can grab the T about 1/2 block from Max & Erma's and get off at the North Shore stop, which is between the two stadiums.  There is also parking on the North Shore that is less expensive than parking in downtown Pittsburgh."}
