{"text":"Awesome food. Good prices. Mom and pop shop

I took the fried porch which was amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent resto de quartier ! Nourriture fraiche et gouteuse, bon gout pas trop salé comme d'autre resto haïtien."}
{"text":"Le griot et le tasso sont délicieux. Encore une fois, les portions sont énormes, j'en ai pour 2 jours et encore....
Service rapide quoique le livreur n'avait pas de change. Sinon, prix abordable: Pour un pat de griot et un plat de tasso, 28.11$ avec taxe."}
{"text":"I will admit that this review has nothing to do with how good or bad the food is. It's about the actual place. This was my third time calling them to see if i can order some food. And once again...NOTHING!!!

Mind you that all the times that i called was during their opening hours. So, i would expect being able to get something right? Wrong! The first time, a man answered and tells me that they'll be opening at 1 pm and told me to call back. I did and no one was there to pick up. The second time i called was around 5 pm to put an order in for diner. I was ready to drive there to get the food. They were out of food and that, on a Thursday afternoon! This time i called at noon and told the person that i wanted to try and order a plate for diner (i figured i would give them 6-7 hours of prep time) and that i was going to come pick it up. This time's response was that they didn't know if the cook was going to show up. They suggested me to call on Monday. Now that's it! I am DONE. It's not like if we were lacking good restaurants and good Haitian/creole restaurants here in town. They lost my vote :/

Too bad for them"}
