{"text":"I enjoyed my first visit. I ordered a serving of French toast and sausage and both were more than satisfying. I was waited on within minutes of taking my seat and the order was delivered within minutes of having it taken. The other customers made my experience worth my while. They were funny, welcoming, and clearly had a love for the restaurant, staff, and other passersby. I would highly recommend this eatery."}
{"text":"One of the top family restaurants in all of Cleveland. Friendly personable staff always ready to serve you and never treat you as if you're just money. I usually go there and get their BLT which is to die for. You can sit in or order out which is absolutely amazing when you're in a rush in the morning."}
