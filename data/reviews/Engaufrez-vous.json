{"text":"Ce petit resto est une découverte que je ne visite pas assez souvent à mon goût. Ambiance relaxe, employés très accueillant, gaufres à tomber par terre ! Juste miam !"}
{"text":"What a pleasant experience! Service was friendly and attentive. There were 6 of us and everyone tried a different waffle. They were all delicious. The juices and coffee are fresh and tasty. We even brought home a few treats for later... Also delicious. The prices are quite reasonable too. If you're in the mood for a great waffle, with a tasty difference this is the place!"}
{"text":"Les gaufres liégeoises sont fantastiques.  Toute la famille a aimé."}
{"text":"Délicieux tout est fait maison ! Les gaufres sont tres bonnes mais les prix assez élevés par contre. Je recommande fortement la gaufre mangue framboise chocolat blanc. Ce sont des Petites portions si vous ne prenez pas un menu"}
{"text":"By far this is one of the best places I have visited not only in Montreal but also in the World! Brunch is delicious!"}
{"text":"Really diversified menu with all sorts of waffles. Really friendly service. Charming restaurant that I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My dreams came true in this restaurant. The flamande - \"big wheel\" was like what I imagine professional athletes eat every morning. Solid staff as well."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. It doesn't matter it you go for savory or sweet, you won't be disappointed. They even have a little nook for people with small children, which very welcome when we had brunch with a friend who had their daughter with them. I had the apple and cheese waffle, which was fantastic. Their portion size is decent and their staff was very forgiving of my poor attempts at speaking French. Luckily they had menus in both English and French."}
{"text":"Un petit bijou niché dans un coin tranquille du Plateau. Les amateurs de délicieuses gauffres belges et ceux qui aiment manger santé seront comblés. Entre gauffres farcies au Nutella et à la poutine (oui! poutine!), on a l'embarras du choix. Essayez le brunch La Grande Roue, vous en redemanderez!"}
{"text":"To be quite honest, we were a bit underwhelmed when we arrived. The place looks like a little neighborhood café, no more, no less. There were only a couple of locals inside, which is not exactly a good sign on the usually crowded plateau. We selected a couple of waffles on their paper menu and had plain coffees, which were pretty boring (we're big 'ccinos fans). Again, underwhelmed to say the least, but don't be fooled: the main course is a show in itself.  The last time I felt so greedy about a meal was at Apollo, the well known restaurant of renowned chef Giovanni Apollo. Their plates are composed of waffles and delicately assembled sweet and salty treats that literally had me go crazy over what I should eat first. There was a little something to please all of my fancies in my plate, and it really gave me a sense off satisfaction that I honestly never experienced when having breakfast.  One of the plateau's best kept secret. Best bang for you buck in the neighborhood for sure."}
{"text":"Great lunch, brunch or \"goûter\" option. Many combos including amazing fresh juices. Worth a visit! We need those type of business to stay in business!"}
{"text":"Ambiance super sympa, Partons sympa ! Concepte original et menu encore plus ! Absolument à faire en venant à Montréal !"}
{"text":"Des brunchs originaux autour de la gaufre, et surtout excellents! Des assiesttes originales, et bien travaillées, avec des produits de qualité. Au menu, il y a des choix de salé, de sucré ou même les deux si vous êtes vraiment gourmands..."}
{"text":"Fresh...pleasant service.  Amazing food.  We tried the stuffed waffles, 1 savory (mushroom, prosciutto, cheese), 1 sweet (chocolate, pear). Fresh and amazing berry/rhubarb smoothie.  Very friendly."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend around 11 on a Thursday morning because we were craving waffles and wanted something different from the classic eggs, pancakes, or omelette option. The menu was French and I speak broken French at best, but the employee was super friendly and helpful! There were options of either sweet or savoury waffles, and so many choices of toppings that I had difficulty choosing. I finally settled on a stuffed waffle with raspberries, mangoes, and dark chocolate ( I don't remember what else) and it was super yummy ! Different from the typical waffles I eat because they're thinner and not as fluffy (probably because they're stuffed) but I enjoyed it and would go back to try their types of waffles! My friend and I ended up staying over 3 hours just chatting, and it was super nice because the employee didn't rush us and just checked up on us to see if we needed any more coffee. Prices are decent too! I only paid 11.50 (including tax) and I was very satisfied  In short, unique brunch place with great service and I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is super interesting and well worth a visit. They specialize in waffles which makes it different from your standard brunch place. We got the taster plate which gives you a bit of everything.  I'd never have thought there would exist so many different types of waffles, there were all sorts of shapes and colours on the plate. There are both sweet and savoury waffles - some of them are even stuffed! My favourite was the gaufres liegioses - the bright yellow ones - which I'd probably order if I were to come back here.  The only downside was that, as it was a hot summer's day, they didn't have any whipped cream, as it is homemade and it spoils in the heat. Although understandable, it was quite a disappointment, as waffles without whipped cream makes me sad and should make any self-respecting human sad. That being said, they did have a variety of other dips and sauces for the waffles, and the plate was really good nonetheless.   Overall, a really great, unique brunch experience, and I'd highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"A quaint quiet bristo/cafe vibe of a place.  I enjoy Sunday brunch here starting off with a savory selection with salad/veg then ending with a sweet (always get whipped cream on the side) & a coffee. When the little lady is serving - it's great to be recognized and she knows we always know what we want, so don't have to wait to give our order.  Her husband is in the kitchen and on weekends, as they've gained more clientele the little lady spends more time in the kitchen too. Truly a pity as she is far sharper and quicker than anyone she's hired."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Montreal! Perfect combo of savory and sweet.. you get your money's worth and a little more. For $12 you get coffee/tea, freshly squeezed orange juice, chocolate waffers, eggs, Belgian waffle, fruit salad and more! Delicious food and friendly staff. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Best stuffed waffles hands down. The decadent and the salmon waffles are our go to every time. The plates are decent sized and come with eggs and amazing coffee and the best juice/smoothie ever. Great value for money. Staff is super nice too. I hope this place doesn't start having lines outside..."}
{"text":"Man Montreal has to bring its waffle game up! Toronto is winning over right now with starving artist, Engaufrez-vous is a cute spot but service is a whole different ball game.  We were here as a group of 10 with reservation. There were 2 waitress, one who spoke way too fast for me to understand the menu that my friend had to translate to me (that bad).  We finally ordered the chef's special -4 random waffle choices by the chef for 24$ ans 30$ with tea, juice or coffee for 2 ppl. The waffles weren't anything special, lego my ego for 15+$? Although the presentation was beautiful!The mimosas were great for 7.50$ with freshly squeezed orange juice.  The stars drop when one of the ladies didn't get her order even after a good chunk of time. We notice the 2 waitresses sit down to eat while our friend didn't even get her meal. Eventually we had to remind the servers politely -the meal ended up being on the house. I'm glad there was such courtesy.  Major service turnoff!"}
{"text":"Far surpassed my expectations. A little pricier than your average breakfast spot but the quality, originality and choices were all top notch. The assorted fruit was fresh and the waffles were excellent with lots of different options. Definitely will be back soon"}
{"text":"Totally get the European vibe at this cafe, although it's small and quaint, it has a lot to offer, I had my usual craving for a plain waffle and it did not disappoint portion size is normal and filling, I had the 2nd brunch choice on their menu, btw which was well explained by our kind and friendly waiter. Will add some pics too!!! Yum, if I'm ever in town, will make a visit!!!!"}
{"text":"Blaaaah....  Too expensive, small portions and lousy service.  Yes, we were a group. But we did made a reservation. If a large group is an issue, they should have let us know.  The \"4 waffles for 2pp\" deal left me hungry. Not a deal at all.  Some were good, but the waffles were done in 4 bites.  The juice was a glorified shooter. Someone had to hail the server for coffee refill.  The server were eating next to us as someone was still waiting for her plate. That's how bad the service was.  I won't be seen there again."}
{"text":"Si, comme moi, vous adorez les gaufres, c'est une place à essayer sans hésiter!! Vous aurez un grand choix de gaufres sucrés et salées, avec la possibilité de les prendre dans une assiette avec des fruits, de la salade, etc... Idéal pour le brunch Les gaufres sont vraiment excellentes, et les à-cotés aussi, même les jus Il n'y a pas beaucoup de tables à l'intérieur, alors je vous conseille d'appeler avant pour savoir s'il y a de la place, ou de patienter si vous êtes patients :) Le gérant était très sympa aussi, on a un peu discuté A essayer vraiment!"}
{"text":"Woah Woah. C'est juste trop bon. Les saveurs sont la. L'acceuil est agréable. Les portions sont adéquates. The price is very affordable for the quality. The sample sizes are the right  portions. The fresh compote and homemade juice!!!! Heaven!!!  They explain the plate and you eat with your eyes and savor all. Great place. I TOTALLY recommend. Good service."}
{"text":"If you love gauffres, you will be in paradise. But pay attention to not order too much food as their plates are big!!!"}
{"text":"If you're a waffle fan, this place is for you! It's quaint, in the plateau section-service was excellent. The staff was very attentive and nice! It took us a few minutes to figure out our ordering options:there are a few-who knew you could do so much with waffles? The three of us opted for the sweet Waffle with maple syrup, an egg & a side of fruit. That side of fruit has the best assortment of fresh fruit I've ever had alongside my breakfast order! Coffee/tea and juice are included with the order.  The presentation was beautiful and the price was reasonable!"}
{"text":"Everything is perfect: starting from the service, where they explain everything about their plates, to the quality of food, which is artisan and delicious. Amazing choice of waffles and fillings, coffee, tea, juice, fresh fruit, pastries... Also great value for money. Atmospheric, gastronomic and absolutely great."}
{"text":"Very nice place with really good and fresh food. Loved the waffles and they also have the best fruits I've ever had with a brunch."}
{"text":"Really good place, there are a lot of choices of waffle, we ordered two brunch combos, the first one and the second one in the menu, which are$10 and $12. I choose one salty waffle which has salmon inside, I never eat that kind of waffle before, which is very tasty. The omelette is also very great. I will definitely go there next time for brunch."}
{"text":"Yep, it's good. And don't expect a conventional waffle, either - prepare to step a bit outside of your waffle comfort zone, and be pleasantly surprised! In fact, if you are the type that likes to hand over your decision-making, choose the plate for two (assuming you're with a brunch date), which is the chef's choice of an assortment of waffle types/ styles. I recommend the Caroussel if you want a full but not gluttonous brunch, and the choice to make. There are many choices of sweet and/or savoury waffles, plus fantastic fruit salads on the side in a waffle cup, or savoury salad, your choice of egg, nice juice, coffee or tea, all included.  I was surprised that the waffles don't come with maple syrup, and when I asked my server for some, she advised me to just try them without, first. So, I took her advice and, they really didn't need it to be really awesomely tasty. However, I am a die-hard maple syrup lover, so next time, I will ask for it - they will bring it to you if you decide you want it.  The ambiance and décor could use a little TLC, but otherwise, everything was great! Nice servers, not a bad wait, and an incredibly satisfying meal that left me full but not grotesquely stuffed. Yums all around."}
{"text":"Si vous aimez les gaufres dans tous ces états, je vous recommande ce lieu !   Gaufres salés, fourrés, sucrés il y en a pour tous les goûts !   Nous avons choisi le plat avec un mix de 4 gaufres (choix du chef) pour pouvoir en goûter plusieurs et nous n'avons pas regretter notre choix.   Un petit bémol au saumon que j'ai trouvé un peu trop salé mais sinon le reste était nickel !"}
{"text":"This bright small restaurant run by two ladies is quite charming. Wanting something a bit different than the usual eggs brunch etc Engaufrez-vous looked like a perfect choice in the Plateau. The relaxed service since both of them were taking orders and delivering food it can be slightly slow but we weren't in a hurry.  While there was an initial mishap of lost rsvp even though we received an email confirming it. C'est la vie. They did not. Needless, to say we join the line of waiting customer for a table. Eventually, seated in two comfortable red sofa chaise towards the front of the restaurant. Both ordered the Carousels with waffle and one with Gaufres Bruxelloises and the other liegeoises. The waffle was light and mildly sweet from the dusting of powdered sugar. The liegeoise was smaller denser slightly sweeter. Both ordered the fruit and I had the omelet with tomatoes.   The brunch meal was perfect. It was light, the fruit refreshing with the right amount of food. Everyone was content with their choices. It is going to be a good day."}
{"text":"Excellente surprise ! Très grande qualité de service et les plats sont excellents. La présentation est soignée et l'ambiance tranquille. A essayer absolument !"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Used to live nearby but I also take the time to come by now that I live a bit further away. La forestière is my go-to! Great service, kind staff and delicious food."}
{"text":"Nous avons réservé pour un groupe d'une quinzaine de personnes après un super événement Yelp chez Arabesque Burlesque. Comme la capacité est plus petite en cuisine, il y a eu un petit délai pour le service des plats, mais le service était bon et très courtois.   Le menu est assez diversifié, soit avec des gaufres sucrées ou salées et sous 3 différentes formes. Aussi, il y a l'option brunch qui permet de faire un choix de gaufres avec fruits et/ou légumes avec un café et un jus frais. Une copine et moi avons partagé le \" Engaufrez-vous pour 2 \" et avons eu 4 gaufres au choix du chef. 3 sucrées et une salée. Le choix était très bon, surtout le salé qui était en plein celle que je voulais, soit la gaufre farcie au saumon et poireaux!  Très bon choix, définitivement un bon endroit pour bien satisfaire votre envie de gaufres à prix raisonnable!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!. Proper, detailed review coming later. .. Briefly though, when in Montreal, you must brunch here."}
{"text":"Really underwhelming. Plates come with leftover stale cookie scraps and asparagus (???), with a measly cup of fruit. The waffles themselves don't have that waffle fluffiness, but are more like thin crepes with a waffle pattern. And their juice has a thick nectar consistency which I dislike. I had the Raspberry chocolate crepe. It was alright. Really too sweet.  Overrall, would not go again. Was not worth 16$."}
{"text":"Everything feels very 'homemade' and authentic! Charming little place. Come on weekdays, there is no lineup!  Delicious! I do wish the portion is slightly bigger. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I'm visiting Montreal and found this place on yelp!!! If you're a fan of Nutella and waffles please check this out! All the food is well thought out, fresh fruit and nice feel!!!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place for a brunch or lunch. We had 2 savory and 2 sugary waffles, and all were excellent. The brightly colored shop is also wonderful - puts you in a good mood as soon as you come in.   One tip: their brunch menus are quite expensive (around $CAN15-25 because you are paying for coffee and orange juice and fruit salad and so on, which are not the restaurant's specialty), but it is not that expensive if you just take waffles (~CAN$6 for a savory one, ~CAN$4 for a sugary one - enjoy!)"}
{"text":"Wow! These waffles are stuffed (as in baked into the waffle) with goodies, or not: from sweet to savory.  $3.50 to $6.00 you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great food, superb service, great vibe. I was alone on a Saturday morning and felt very comfortable being a party of one in that place. I came around noon so no line up. I ordered the big breakfast which in my case was a savoury stuffed waffle with an omelette and coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice and lovely combination of fruit."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite place in Montreal. Considering I'm French, vegetarian and picky about food it means something. The concept is great and their side goodies (salt and sweet) are amazing."}
{"text":"Cette petite place fais des gaufres a tomber par terre. Nous sommes allés bruncher et nous n'avons pas été déçu . Nous avions pris  les montagnes russes, tout était délicieux, surtout la gaufre a la frangipane.  Si vous aimez les gaufres allez faire un tour , vous ne serez pas déçu!"}
{"text":"The waffles here are pretty great. The savory options are especially noteworthy, with the Italian waffle blending basil, cheese and tomatoes quite aptly. That said, the chocolate and fruit combos tend to taste better during the Summer as the sourness of the berries does not seem sufficiently countenanced by the sweetness of the chocolate in winter."}
{"text":"I often passed in front of the restaurant, the smell was always so appealing and I really wanted to try it each time but did not have the chance. So when I came on Sunday with my friends I maybe had high expectations about this place. We were standing in front of the door because there was no seats, no problem let's have a coffee and orange juice. The waitress offered it nicely and served us until we heard her boss (we presumed he was with the tone of voice) telling her serve the guests that are seated. Euh dude what's your problem it's only coffee she is not cooking for us !!! Really bad especially if it's coming from the owner. The menu is original, you select the option that you prefer and then you can check on the board the type of waffle they have (salted and sweet) and you make your choice. Food was average, my waffle was super salty it was unpleasant. And the rest of the plate was not exceptional. We all liked the juice they proposed. So I don't really recommend it, you have way better on the Plateau and better service ..."}
{"text":"Définitivement les meilleurs gaufres de Montreal! Parfait pour un brunch entre amis, en famille ou en couple! L'endroit est agréable et chaleureux. Les menus sont variés entre sucré et salé et les quantités sont très satisfaisantes. À essayer à tout prix!"}
{"text":"Amateur de gaufres, vous serez servie. Petite place en plein mont-royale( personnellement, je n'aime pas la déco mais la bouffe en vaut le coup), vous avez le choix dans une panoplie de gauffres sucrées ou salés, classiques ou originales. Les assiettes sont a un prix tres raisonnable et abordable. Ca vaut le coup d'y aller."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch when my friend was in town for a visit. Delicious food, with a full range of any kind of waffle and toppings you could possibly want! Love how the menu is organized by price and size, so you can get something small or a massive meal! Service was excellent, definitely planning on coming back!"}
{"text":"Endroit chaleureux.  Entre amis ou en famille, vous dégusterez des bonnes gaufres salées & sucrées.  La présentation des assiettes est soignée.  Vous s'y serez bien servi et si vous êtes un habitué, vous pouvez faire tourner la roue des cadeaux au bout de 6 canards :-)"}
{"text":"what a fantastic little breakfast place! The waffles are all delicious and the sides that come with the russian mountain are fantastic. The prices are reasonable and I love that they include both a tea or coffee plus a freshly squeezed juice. I could've happily shared my russian mountain with another person, but then again, I don't have the biggest appetite. This was a nice find :)"}
{"text":"Quickly, yes both thumbs up....I went to this place thanks to the reviews in yelp. It's located in one of my favorite part of the city, once you've finished with breakfast, walking up and down boul. St.Laurent is always a treat. Back to breakfast. We were 3 and the place is small but we got in. The place is small so if you're going to be 6 or more call ahead. Ordering was fun, you would think we all know how to order from a menu...no there was a lesson. Once we understood how to order the variations were...well there was a lot to consider, and I mean that in a good way. We had a savory and sweet dish, everything was fresh delicious with a many nice touches. Fruit cup on one side greek salade on the other, stuffes waffle in the middle, egg, gluten free bread ball stuffed with cheese, home made jam, freshly squeezed tropical fruit juice. I can go on but it was a real gem of a find. The only down side was the chair, don't expect high end fancy tables chairs and decor, you go to this place for the fresh food and very different from any other breakfast resto. Bonne appetite."}
{"text":"This place was solid. Service was very good and helpful. Interior decor was also superb- very cozy. My party all got the combo ($13), which came with a soup, greens, main waffle, mini waffle (?) as well as a sweet waffle at the end. The soup was okay, personally didn't go too well with the rest of the plate. The greens/salad was as expected. Stuffed savory waffle was nice, a little small but definitely unique. Salmon tasted good  The waffle on top of the salad was kinda hard.. and a little bland. Not too sure what it was doing on the plate tbh. The \"icing\" was powdered sugar.. so the sweet was okay. Maybe waffles isn't my thing.. but for the savoury waffle and ambience and service in the restaurant..worth!"}
{"text":"We visited Montreal from the US and decided to eat at this place with some friends and ask for a table for 4 then for a table for 2 as 2of my friends decided to go eat somewhere else. The guy who \"took care of us\" said it wasn't possible to have a table since we didn't have a reservation and the wait should be about 45 min. So we decided to take waffle to go. 20 minutes after, we were still waiting for our waffle to be done, a couple came in and ask for a table. What a surprise when this guy told them that they would have a table but they would have only one to eat as the table is reserved for 12PM. I don't want to assume anything but maybe we weren't of the right color."}
