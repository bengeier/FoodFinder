{"text":"The lady working there had nails so long that they ripped through the tip of the gloves and yet she still decided it was a good idea to reach into the salad bar with her hands opposed to using the tongs to pick up the food.  Very gross, furthermore my salad came with \"extra protein\" (yes there was a bug) included.  It is not like it was a small one either.  avoid avoid avoid.  Cleanliness and health codes is not something this location believes in.  Called corp office no call back also called the health department to report."}
{"text":"Waited for 5 minutes before someone told me they weren't making smoothies anymore.  That's the purpose of the Banana side of the business, it was 7P and the web says they should be open till 8:30 on Sunday.  Boo!"}
{"text":"Thought I found a decent place to eat at Cleveland airport - I ordered the Far East salad- it's okay - would like more vegetables though. The frosties - which was advertised as ice and fruits only- is sickenly sweet- they must have added sugar somehow- I had half of the regular size and could already feel sugar rush - literally. Sorry had to reduce to 1 star due to false advertising!"}
{"text":"Showed up at 8pm but there were no employees present. I walked around for 15 minutes and came back. I was told immediately that only cold wraps are available. I asked what time they closed and the employee said 8:30 but they spend the last 30 minutes cleaning. What's the point of having business hours until 8:30? Most places of business clean up after they close, not while they are open and limiting selections. Is this a management issue, trying to save on payroll or a franchise owner decision? Or are the employees making it up as they go along? Terrible, just terrible."}
{"text":"Wrap was pre-made and soggy. A place that boasts freshness should by be serving pre-made soggy wraps."}
{"text":"Green Leaf's is located in Concourse C - near the United Club in Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.

They offer a variety of fresh, tasty wraps, salads, and sandwiches.

I decided to try the Thai Chicken wrap - I would have preferred it to be more \"Thai\" spicy - but it will probably appeal to more folks by not being spicy. It had lots of fresh, crisp veggies in it.

Good spot for a healthy, quick lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"So apparently, Green Leaf's in Cleveland Hopkins International Airport stops serving food but doesn't close completely after a certain time. I happened to get there at a time when all they had left was frozen yogurt. Well, I was hungry and food is food. Besides, I had a flight to catch.

Four dollars for a cup of frozen yogurt is expensive yet standard at the same time. It was a fairly large cup, and there was no tax so $3.99 actually was the price I paid. The yogurt itself wasn't bad; it's just your ordinary frozen yogurt. I wish I could have stuck around to try their wraps or something, but I had to jet. Pun intended."}
{"text":"Do you want a salad? Can't have it.
Want one of the menu options? Nope.
Would you like to order something besides the premade wrap? Sorry, out of luck.

This restaurant looked like the best option in the Cleveland airport. The menu showed pictures of fresh, green food, and there was a case with lots of tasty-looking salad materials. The first sign that something was wrong was that there were only 2 workers manning both the Green Leaf's and the adjoining fro-yo place. When we finally got to the counter, we asked for the \"Green Leaf's\" salad. The worker looked at us with something like anguish and sighed, \"I'll have to make it.\" We agreed, and she disappeared into the kitchen to find her coworker. After several minutes, she returned. Since it seemed like making the salad would be too much of an ordeal fo r her, we asked for a prepackaged wrap and panini instead. 

As we were waiting for the panini to heat, another customer ordered a salad. The worker took his order and payment. Then she handed over a sandwich! When the customer said, \"I ordered a salad,\" and pointed to the menu which clearly showed SALAD, she just said \"It doesn't come that way.\"

Not sure what was going on (maybe the regular workers were out?), but apparently the salad case is just there to tempt you, and you can only have disappointing, not-too-fresh food. It would have been awful, if it wasn't so funny!"}
