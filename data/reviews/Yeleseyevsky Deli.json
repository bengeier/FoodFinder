{"text":"This Russian grocery store is the largest I've visited in the US - except in NYC, of course. They have an extensive selection of desserts, candy, canned goods, pickled things, caviars and fishes, cheeses and meats, and freshly-prepared foods - from beef tongue and olevye (Russian potato salad) to pierogies (think calzones) and coleslaw. They also have some Russian books, greeting cards, medicines, drinks, etc. As others mention, the wait for a cashier can be a bit long, but the wait at the deli was non-existent, so trade-offs, I guess."}
{"text":"Oh man. Where do I begin.
First of all, when you walk in here, it's like you're walking in to willy wonkas chocolate factory. Only, this is the Russian chocolate factory. 
My friend introduced me to this place a while back because I was looking for something different. I was tired of American cake. 
Way to much frosting and not enough cake. Or vise versa.
Well, I was introduced to Spatka! Holy hell. This is thin layer after layer of cake and frosting. Equal amounts of both, perfectly sweetened. I will admit this, we bring home a cake and eat the entire thing right out of the box while binge watching Netflix.
The other baked goods they have are just as spectacular. Really, nothing that is prepared here is bad.
We love to just bring home the locks and snack on those for a few days. 
They do have a deli that is packed full of homemade delicious Russian foods. Hot and fresh. 
I would highly recommend this place. If you don't speak or understand the Russian language, I would ask for help."}
{"text":"Good luck finding a cashier in this store, two days in a row had to wait for a cashier for 15 minutes. There were two employees at the deli section, which is right across from the register, and they didn't even ask me if I needed help at the register. After making me wait for 15 minutes, a lady walked from the back and rang me out."}
{"text":"If you're Russian or a fan of Russian food and in Mayfield you must try this place. The only reason for the 4 stars is because they aren't friendly to non Russians. The employees won't be very friendly or helpful or really even smile at you if you don't speak to them in Russian.

This is a pretty big store with a wide selection. I mean they have basically everything you could want. A pretty good selection of smoked fish and good selection of meats. Their prepared foods section is fantastic. Their eggplant salad (or really anything with eggplant) is amazing as are their cabbage salads. They will let you try anything and everything so ask if you're curious.

They have grains, juices, canned items and anything you could want. I really like their chocolate selection and desserts. There is no way you can do this store wrong. Enjoy!!"}

Thumb up from Borat

Velcome to this deli! Pleeze to enjoy eastern world delicacies. Smoked fishes, many types sausage, pickled vegetable, pickled herrings, kvas, beers,
and beautiful vimen singing the Russian songs while they stock the shelf. Frozen cakes from the Brooklyn \"ittle kremlin\" area.  Nazdrovya!

Karry on, Comrade..."}
{"text":"Love an independent grocery store.  They have every Eastern European thing you crave, as well as some things which will make you wonder how you ever lived without them. Impressive selection of house-warming gifts and fish: fresh, frozen, smoked, or shelved.  I tried some kind of little chicken loaf from the deli and was instantly whisked back to grandma's kitchen."}
{"text":"This an impressive Russian market and deli. We were surprised with the amount of authentic offerings, the variety of produce and price. The deli is sizable and has a wonderful selection of meats, cheeses, breads, seafood and pre-made items."}
{"text":"I've been going here for quite a while, maybe eight years or so. I'm not Russian whatsoever, mind you, though I speak enough Russian to get through an average (short) interaction. 

First off, yes, there are times when it can take a long time for a cashier to ring you out. If you are on a time crunch, it might not be best to stop in. Also, the cashiers don't seem to respond well to being greeted, and generally only speak when spoken to (most of them speak flawless English and Russian.) They might also avoid eye contact. A friend from Minsk (Belarus) told me this was a culture thing, a friend born in Moscow said it was really weird, so i'm not sure who to believe.

Their selection is almost overwhelming to someone who's never seen...Russian stuff before. I'll break down the sections of the store; it's easier that way.

- As you walk in, you see the candy bins, where you can get a bag of mini candies of all different sorts and pay by the pound (or kilogram?)

- Beyond that is produce. Standard bins of various fruits and veggies, nothing super spectacular. Around the rim of this area by the windows are selections of various nuts and seeds, as well as some canned meat and fish. (My ex, who was of Ukranian descent, adored the Riga sprats...somehow.) There are also some coolers with various dairy things, lots of kefir and \"drinkable yoghurt,\" as well as standard milk, and imported butter and condiments. I recommend the Polish butter.)

- This area also has the seafood counter, with every standard Russian seafood staple ready to rock. Tons of vobla, various other dried fish, and a selection of \"real\" caviar with prices in the hundreds. That is probably the one thing from Yeleseyevsky i'll never get to try.

- Walking back the way you came in, there's a section of freezers with lots of pierogies and other frozen things. 

- The deli counter. This is sort of the centerpiece of the store. One side has ready-made potato salad and other Russian-themed lunch items, the side facing the front has gorgeous pastries (I love me some Napoleon from here,) and the far side has lots of lunch meat type stuff. (This store also does catering, I guess.)

The rest of the store is divided into standard aisles. There is a huge wine section (with some beer, too, but no Russian vodka, sorry,) and a smaller cooler with some soda (mostly Turkish) and kvass (a fruit/malt soda/brew that is extremely refreshing.) There's a little island of shelves with various Russian t-shirts and metal signs, plus a locked case of keepsakes such as flasks bearing Soviet insignia and real Russian nesting dolls.

The main food section is fairly vast for an import/ethnic store. There's a square island of spices, and another one of diabetic specialty foods (I recommend Meteorit chocolates as long as your diabetic friend has some chompers, they're pretty chewy.) The aisles range from baking supplies, tea, fruit juice, condiments, two aisles of Russian-language books, Nutella and it's Russian counterparts, chocolates, wafer sheets, and other assorted goods.

At times, they'll have a specialty shelf full of things from a particular country. (I think the most recent was Lithuania.)

The front counter area has all sorts of chocolates, as well as a bunch of medicine with zero English on it. (Side note, most of the products have a sticker explaining them in English.) There are also some soaps, hair products and things like toothpaste.

My one complaint about Yeleseyevsky is that, if you see something interesting on a shelf, buy it, because with a few exceptions, once their stock of something is gone, they never carry it again.

Overall, it's a full-on experience to go here, and i'd highly recommend it."}
