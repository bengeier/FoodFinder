{"text":"Great drinks and service! . Only place I know you can get Dos Cielos beer and micheladas are amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to chill and relax... Don't bring any trouble or you will be kicked out, but if you just want to relax and have a few drink this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I thought we had freedom of speech in america. When I wrote the last review, I didn't say anything that wasn't true. At that time. So why would I be threatened with physical violence from the bartender? Reviews are meant just that a review thats all I did and now you want to threaten me for freedom of speech it just makes your bar look bad sorry you have to go through that Javier"}
{"text":"Great place really friendly people the owner is a nice man sits down and chats with his customers just moved to arizona been here a few times and love it so far bar tenders are really friendly as well never feel pressured"}
{"text":"Exceptional bartenders! Even when it's super busy, my drink is never empty! Best service in the valley!"}
{"text":"I've only been there twice during the afternoon but both times was quite pleasant. It's definitely a dive. But I enjoyed myself. Only reason it got 4 instead of 5 is there was a pup there that liked me a little too much and wouldn't leave me alone but once the owner of the dog saw they took care of the situation promptly."}
{"text":"I've been twice and both times the food was really good. It's definitely a dive bar so don't be expecting it to be anything fancy but that's exactly what I like about about it! Bartenders and wait staff were friendly and accommodating, drinks were great, and there is a really good mix of people. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Okay I'm visiting from Cali and I'm so familiar with little dive bars so I thought I'd give this a try ! Martin was our bartender and it was pretty busy for a Sunday night I didn't expect a lot of people to be there but he handled everyone's order accordingly with politeness! He was playing some good music while making some bomb micheladas with a room full of people. I will definitely make this my go to spot when I'm down visiting because of the good service I received tonight !!"}
{"text":"Friday was like the third time I had been to this place I dont think I will return. There is so much drama there I felt like I was back in high school. Each time this guy who I believe he has a relationship to one of the bartenders. The first time he got into a fight that the other bartender told him to leave she was tired of of. Then this Friday he was fight again. I guess the owner is fine with it he cause the other man was made to leave. So I thought things were calm boy was i mistaken. This girl whom was stand next to the door as you walk in. (Which appears to be the cheerleaders table.) Comes over to the pool table where we place some quarters to play and tells me I have to play as partners with her cause she did not like the couple and want the table and make them leave. Then so skinny guy who had nothing to do with the table started talking crap. So if you want a drama evening great place cause the owner seems to encourage his bartenders and what ever the guy is to the one that is what he wants to see. Not for me. SORRY KEEP YOUR DRAMA!"}
{"text":"No, no, no, don't go.  Bartender smoking while mixing your drink, letting the cigarette hang out of her mouth. Dirty, dark and smells like mold and cigarette smoke. Downstairs is an accident waiting to happen, not safe at all. We left without drinking our drink."}
{"text":"Great dive bar. Amazing prices and  super friendly staff. And great music on the bike box too"}
{"text":"I don't go to bars often but when I do they are typically dive bars. This one seemed very underwhelming. The drinks were cheap but it was musty, dirty, and the table was sticky. I imagine this is a place close to home for regulars and while I imagine many may frequent Aguila's it is not for me."}
