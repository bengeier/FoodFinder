{"text":"Don't come for sports. Came to watch Indians, all we heard was a Lynyrd Skynyrd marathon. Bar said they couldn't turn music off. Food was subpar. Decent beer specials for happy hour."}
{"text":"This is another sports bar in Lakewood. It has a lot of flat screen tv's.  The wait staff is very attentive.  We were there on a night the Indians played and the crowd was really into to game, made it even more enjoyable that they won.  Food is typical bar food, but the appetizers were half off during the game and these were above average.  The pretzals, the chicken dip, and the spinach dip were very good, but the pita chips they served with them were delicious!! Would go here again."}
{"text":"This place is really developing. The menu has expanded and management has finally seemed to build up a solid staff. The patio is one of the best I've seen in Lakewood! Friendly bartenders and servers. Each time I go in there, it seems like a different event is taking place- trivia, speed dating, UFC paper view fights, live bands, DJS, and I think there is a even an arm-wrestling competition coming up. Cozy atmosphere- more than your typical dive bar. I'll be going back for sure :)"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential, but I always walk away disappointed. The venue itself is huge and it's in a decent location without many other bars around. I've been there a few times and am always disappointed in the service. Last time I went, they had booked a pub trivia championship there - which was pretty cool. Bad part was they were completely understaffed, and the staff that were working were pretty inattentive and useless. I had to help myself to get my own water and silverware for my table. Food is mediocre but they have a pretty good beer selection.

The best perk this place has to offer is a pop-a-shot basketball hoop and some pinball machines."}
{"text":"Came in to watch MNF at this sports bar and trivia guy took precedence over the sound system. Disappointed. Waited patiently for trivia guy to finish and asked nicely for the game audio to be turned on... Turns out the TVs that the audio is hooked up on is broken and won't be fixed until the next day. I really wanted to give this place a shot, but it's not looking so good. Currently about to pay my tab and head to another establishment."}
{"text":"This review is a bit on the generous side because I love bar bowing and pinball, but I do think there's a solid foundation here. That said, there were some fundamental flaws on my initial visit. Our server tried but was harried due to what appeared to be understaffing. The food showed signs of lack of care as well, but perfect fries made me think the kitchen has potential. Those were offset by a mediocre quesadilla served with a side of pico de gallo laden with mealy tomatoes. A veggie burger with a nice, spicy patty was let down by coming out completely ungarnished on a mushy Wonder bun. Washing it down with a Dortmunder showed the lack of attention to detail trickles into the bar area as well. It tasted \"off\" but not sour. A few more sips led me to conclude that it tasted a bit like Christmas Ale. I know my Dort, and I'm pretty sure they just didn't change the line when they changed kegs. The other food coming out of the kitchen looked pretty decent, and I'll be back to answer the siren song of the pinball and bowling, so I really hope they can iron out these issues. It wouldn't be that hard."}
{"text":"This new bar does not match the other buildings surrounding it, but in a good way. You can tell not only is it new, but it's nice inside, and it stands out from the other places around it. This end of Lakewood doesn't have the nicest places, so if I frequented this part of town, this is probably where I would go most of the time.....

....maybe. I was here for the first time yesterday, on St. Patrick's Day. When I got my bill, which consisted of 3 Coors Lights, 2 Budweiser bottles, and a chicken tender and fries, I was so shocked to see that it was $25. What made it so shocking was the fact that the Coors Light drafts we got were in the 6 oz. plastic cups, and were $3 each. Are you kidding me?!?! That was a TOTAL RIP OFF, and the biggest reason why this place gets 2 stars. The chicken tenders were $7, which is the normal price if you go to a restaurant, so that was ok. They were pretty good. When I initially asked to see the menu, I was told there was only a select menu and I was verbally told what they had, so I'm not sure what they normally have to eat/what the prices are.

The bartender I dealt with was very nice-she made sure to actually keep checking up on us to make sure we didn't need anything. I might consider going here again, but I'll have to ask them how much drinks are before I order...I will never be okay with pay $3 for 6 oz of coors light!"}
{"text":"Brew 133 is a newer bar on the eastern end of Lakewood. We've been here now several times and have had good experiences. 

Nice atmosphere with plenty of huge, gorgeous flat screens. They're pretty good about making sure your game gets on even if it isn't the most popular one in the bar. A friend wanted the Buffalo Bills game on which was unfortunately on at the same time as as the Browns. No problem, the raised seating area was empty with a TV all our own. 

There is a basketball shooting game and a couple of old school pinball machines in the side room. The patio is big and really nice too! The staff is generally nice and the service has been mostly good.

The food that we've had here is pretty decent although we've only had appetizers. I would not recommend the 'nachos' as they are made with what I'd refer to as greasy pita chips rather than tortilla chips. They weren't very crispy and they had cheese sauce rather than melted cheese - not my thing.  The fried pretzel sticks are actually pretty good - the beer cheese they come with is quite yummy. Do yourself a favor and ask for 2 of the cheese instead of one each cheese and mustard. Or don't.....I'm just a cheese lovin' Sconnie what can I say.

Overall a nice addition to this part of Madison which suffers from an overabundance of dive-y bars and not much else. Check it out next time you're in the mood for catching a game and having some brews."}
{"text":"Here's the thing when it comes to bars: The food is generally a toss up. Could be good, could be average or bad, all depends on the person running the kitchen.

Brew 133 has a very nice setup. Modern design, TVs adorning the upper walls, nice patio area, an area for live music, some games for additional entertainment. The beer selection is pretty good (they actually have some selections that are hard to find - I'm a ShockTop fan, for example). They are a tad bit understaffed at times, but the staff tries to be as attentive as they can, they are very friendly, so I can forgive the occasional waiting a couple extra minutes for a refill.

The food I've eaten so far has been very good.  Wings are flavored well, appetizers in general are generally good (as good as fried anything can be expected to be, of course). But their sandwiches are very tasty, the biggest thing being that the cooks know how to cook meat correctly (a medium burger is actually medium). It helps that the kitchen manager/head cook went to culinary school. The Cuban sandwich is as close to authentic as I've encountered in NE Ohio (I am from Miami, FL).  The cook even applied a recommendation from my wife and I to make the sandwich even closer to authentic, and it came out superb. It seems like the kitchen manager is making a concerted effort to improve food whenever possible, even already good dishes. I like that attitude.

Outside of that, they keep the atmosphere comfortable, they'll find whatever game you are looking to watch (Dolphins games are hard to come by up here, but they always find it for me), the food is reasonably priced, and they look to improve whenever they can. Not much more you can ask for than that.

Young businesses typically have a tough time getting going in the first year or two, but I wish Brew 133 the best of luck.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"It's where the old Sullivan's used to be.  It's got lots of seating on the inside. And a great sized bar. 
Bar area is very comfortable. Excellent choice of taps - the good stuff too! Not all 
\"lites\", Prices were reasonable, while we were there - during an Indians game.
The crowd  and atmosphere was up!

I ordered the Brew Burger.  Nice job on the burger size. And fixings were fresh - lettuce, tomato, onion ring, beer cheese sauce. But the burger itself did not
taste char-broiled or cooked fresh.  It tasted like it was cooked ahead of time
and re-heated.  Fries were good, and served with a pickle.  Price was just
right. 

Server was very polite and attentive despite being over crowed. Although
we had to wait awhile.   I think they
could've use some more wait staff. Next time I will try the wings. I was told
they were good.

Loved the 3 large TV screens in a row. Good place to watch sports."}
{"text":"Was very excited to be there for this busy night of the Tribe playing for the wildcard.  However, the service was terribly slow.  From ordering a beer to ordering food, everything too way too long.  I'm afraid to go back on any night when there is a big game on.  They seemed woefully understaffed for a game like this.

I had high hopes that they would be a great local alternative to the big sports bars."}
