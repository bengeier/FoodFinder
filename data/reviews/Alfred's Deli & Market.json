{"text":"This weekend I was really missing my grandmother & her cooking. I was in the mood for comfort food, like pierogies. I checked Yelp and found Alfred's, which looked to be about 30 minutes from my home. I found it easily enough. 
Unfortunately, I only had enough $ with me so I could only one dozen of frozen potato as they were $9. (That price seems to be the norm compared to other sites I checked)
 At home I fried them in a pan with butter & onions until they were golden and slightly crunchy. The potato filling was good and the dough itself was delicious. They just went too fast so no left-overs.
I will definitely be back again...and the the next time I will try the sauerkraut ones."}
{"text":"Seriously a gem in the city of pittsburgh! Located in the original polish neighborhood of the city, polish hill, this is  THE ORIGINAL polish deli  .. Miss Anna is seriously the nicest lady I have ever met! She has owned the business for 25 years now and is still \"going strong no matter what competition comes her way\" she said to me the other day.. She cares about the neighborhood and what people need and want .. You can go in and get your day to day needs such as eggs, toilet paper, milk, even cigarettes .. But what really makes this the best is her seriously amazing kielbasa! I promise you you will not find anything like it!!! She offers the polish community an assortment of truly authentic  foods like they would be able to buy back home.. It's kind of like a 50/50 shop but it works! Her pierogi are very good too! She'll even teach you how to make them ! If you are truly looking for AUTHENTIC polish food, then THIS is the place you need to be.!!!  Oh and her prices?... SO affordable! Go visit miss Anna she'll give you a lesson on what REAL polish food should taste like .."}
{"text":"This place is a gem of Polish Hill! First (and least important) of all, if you are needing some basics such as eggs or milk on the Hill, you don't have to walk all the way to the Strip or a Geagle, you can get them at Alfreds. Now for the good stuff:

If you are Polish or have lived there, you may crave some zupa ogorkowa, kostka knora or wedel chocolate once in a while. If you are making bigos, you will need real polska kielbasa. All these things can be found there! Also, the lady who owns/runs the store is SO SWEET and will speak Polish with you!!!! I go here for a million reasons, but she's the biggest reason! Great fresh food too, made right there for you! Go Alfred's!!"}
{"text":"Quality sandwiches! Mack's family has been coming here forever and I finally got to try it. I order an Italian sandwich pretty much everywhere I go since that's what I'm most interested in and this sandwich was great! It's definitely an outdated hole in the wall kind of place, but those are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great little spot for a quick sandwich pick up. They do not skimp on meat. The bread is fresh. You bet your dupa we will be back!!"}
{"text":"The Friendly staff here are great, I come here for sandwiches, pre order on the phone , and 15 minutes later, boom, walk in for a giant sandwich, easy. Homemade pierogi, specialty polish sausages and quality cold cuts, sliced to order, good stuff. Also , this is a well stocked neighborhood grocery mart, fresh produce, dairy and bakery products, as well as soap, cigarettes, soda and pop , as well as many other useful products for use around the house. Bonus, they have a package to Poland post service here, which is useful for the older Polish residents of the neighborhood. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Just moved to lawerenceville and decided to give Alfred's a try. I was not disappointed. I was weary at first if a 6\" sando would be enough but the sandwiches here are no joke. I love Italian sandwiches so I went with the downing. Tons of delicious thick sliced meat. So much I could barely fit the thing in my big mouth. I will be back here again and definitely would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Surprising gem in the heart of Polish Hill right across from the Immaculate Heart of Mary church. The sandwiches are quite wonderful and are piled high with tasty things. There are homemade Pierogies and cheeses and lunch meats.

The staff is quite friendly. 

It's a small place, and there's nothing corporate about this charming cafe, but it's genuine and the great sandwiches will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome pierogis, picked up about four dozen along with other goodies. Stuffed them in a cooler and brought back to Chicago. Very helpful woman at the counter that helped us out. Wish I would have grabbed more!"}
{"text":"Don't be a dummy. Just go eat here. The sandwiches are so well made. Get a Braggs drink if you want a pleasant surprise.

All of the ingredients here are top notch and the care put into the sandwiches really shows. The pickle spear may be the best I have had as well."}
{"text":"The \"new\" Alfred's is such a welcomed place for the Polish Hill neighborhood! In the two+ years we've lived in Polish Hill, we had never ventured into Alfred's because we were never able to stop in during business hours. That's all changed with the store's facelift and updated hours. We haven't had an opportunity to get any of the fresh-made sandwiches they offer, but as a tiny grocery store, it will suit most of your needs if you're looking to avoid the insanity of the large grocers. With the later hours, it's perfect for grabbing some produce or basic ingredients that you're missing for dinner after work. As a smaller store, the only issue is inventory of perishables (bread, particularly) by the end of the day, but I'm still a fan of what they offer. The staff is really nice, and passionate about helping the store succeed, as well, so if there's something that you wish Alfred's carried, let them know and they'll look into fixing the hole in your shopping experience.

It's also a vegan-friendly store, and they offer a lot of organic alternatives for those conscious of such things. Sure, it would be nice to see some cheaper alternatives for some products, but I don't mind supporting the local business and paying a few extra dollars here and there. Heck, it's still cheaper than the Quick Stop down the hill."}
{"text":"Outstanding sandwiches! 
I wish I could eat there everyday. Sometimes I buy the frozen pierogies and keep them on hand for a quick meal at home... they're always very good. And they have a good selection of the things you need, but don't want to (or can't) drive to the big grocery zones. Alfred's is absolutely essential."}
{"text":"In 2010 while moving here from Virginia I fell in love with Polish Hill and decided to rent an apartment nearly directly across the street from the former Alfred's Deli, a store I admittedly never patronized due to my hectic work schedule. Late last summer Leia, the general manager of the store, reopened this place after a period of renovation and has now quickly molded it into a neighborhood institution! 

My partner Andrew and I love this market! Their sandwiches are delicious! Yes, some of their items are on the expensive side, but we honestly don't mind paying those prices for the sake of convenience and also to help keep our revitalizing neighborhood vibrant. I'm a processed food junkie since I don't like to cook (cue the 50 Shades of Grey-like whippings from the Whole Foods crowd), but Alfred's offers a lot of items that are actually GOOD for you, too! Their homemade pierogies are delicious, and I love the little recorded \"Thank you for shopping\" message that plays whenever I open the cooler to get more! About two weeks ago I needed batteries for my wireless keyboard (to write more Yelp reviews, of course), and, sure enough, Alfred's had them! They also have treats for our dog; vegan-friendly items; a limited assortment of fresh produce; and staples like milk and orange juice. They also carry some great Polish delicacies and, my favorite, Polish candies! My partner is happy they carry cigarettes. I'm happy they carry these yummy off-brand (but much better for you) Pop-Tarts!

Around the holidays my partner brought some peppermint fudge over for the girls to enjoy, and they shared some delicious kielbasa and spicy mustard with us! What a treat! Supposedly there are definite plans for a juice bar and MILKSHAKES in the warmer months! I can already envision hanging out with a sandwich, a Polish candy bar, and some delicious juice on a sultry Summer day! 

Wish-list: It seemed like we kept running out of rock salt (these brick sidewalks in our neighborhood are cute but quite slippy!), and I hated having to keep driving back-and-forth to Bloomfield or Shadyside to buy more, especially before or after a trying shift at work. We went through four big bags pretty much just over the past two months. It would have been nice if the store would have carried some ice melt, especially for older residents who I'm sure would have appreciated a closer option to buy it. 

P.S. Leia loves my wiener, too (my Dachshund, that is...you gutter minds! LOL!)

Coupled with Lili Coffee Shop around the corner I can now say that if Polish Hill could just land a laundromat I'd be as happy as a pig in its own excrement!"}
