{"text":"I actually like Heidi deli. It's in the corner so sometime it may be hard to spot. But their breakfast sandwiches are pretty good. I always stop by there for breakfast whenever I can. It's just sometimes the line gets long and it's a bit discouraging. It's not part of one of those franchise chain so it doesn't have all those fancy pictures and lighting displays. But I think I like it better , the hipster in me gets satisfied from may visits to Heidi deli :)  Overall I recommend this place, after a while you realize these small businesses serves up food that are a lot better than those huge franchise stores."}
{"text":"I believe Heidi's is the only restaurant within the Commerce Court food bunker that is not part of a chain.  Perhaps that is why it offers better food at better prices than most of the neighbouring bunker tenants.    While most places within the banker's bunker food courts concentrate on delivering meat-on-a-carbohydrate solutions, Heidi's offers a great range of real meals.  Great breakfasts of western sandwiches or just egg sandwiches.  For lunch, they offer specials that come with soup or a choice of salads.  Service is fast and friendly.  Line ups are a bit longer than some places within the bunker, owing the spot's popularity."}
{"text":"One of my regular breakfast spots in the PATH (Commerce Court).  Super cheap and delicious!    There is usually a line up in the morning, as most folks who go here are regulars...the food is your typical breakfast fare, toasted westerns, fried egg, ham, bacon sandwiches or just your regular bacon and eggs with home fries.  They also have a ton of toppings available to customize your breakfast sandwiches...kinda llike a Harvey's for your toasted bacon and egg sammie.  To be honest I've never hit this place up for lunch, but their lunch menu looks just a down home as their breakfast - soups, salads, sandwiches...pretty basic.  However, if their lunch is as tasty and cheap as breakfast then I highly recommend.  It's not a fancy chain, at times the place can look a bit like it's falling apart (last time i was there the lights on the food prep counter weren't working and the drawer of their cash register kept getting stuck), but again, the food is good and the prices are reasonable when compared to the other options in Commerce Court."}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwiches and platters. Friendly staff and a great   Missing a star because the older Asian lady who works there and cashes people out always acts like someone pissed in her breakfast sandwich."}
