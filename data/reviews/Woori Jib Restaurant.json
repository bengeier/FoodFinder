{"text":"I used to visit U of I a lot in my previous life. For a college town, this place has the best Korean food, probably within the proximity of 200 miles. The rice and soup can be refilled. The price is reasonable. What more can you ask for when you're a cheap college bastard? SRSLY!"}
{"text":"Great food - especially the grilled meats.  Try the Chicken BBQ, Pork BBQ or Galbi.  Remember to grab some of the free soup, it's always yummy.  The owners are very nice people and the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Good food with affordable prices! If you want to save time from cooking, I would recommend this restaurant. I ordered Samgyetang (Ginseng Chicken Soup) from here and to be honest I didn't expect there would be even one piece of ginseng in the soup with $13. However, there was a piece of ginseng in it! I know ginseng is expensive but yeah that's enough for me to wakes my brain up for a day. The soup was great! I will come back!"}
{"text":"i was craving for some cold noodle today (its a hot summer day!) so here i am. The noodle was okay, not enough sauce so its a little bit on the bland side. On the menu the description says it include beef and sashimi, but as you can see on the picture i took, there is no such ingredient! (okay i dont care about sashimi cuz im not too much a seafood person, but where the hell is my beef?!) for almost 10 bucks before tax i got a bunch of steam noodle, a sad little pouched egg and some pickled radish?..... maybe not again..."}
{"text":"S/O to any vegetarians/vegans reading this: WARNING, this is where the very concept of vegetarianism/veganism goes to die.   At Goodfellas, the Korean ah-joo-mah simply gives you that standard, condescending \"uggggh\" glare and reluctantly brings out a meatless dish that they probably spat in. That's what I'm more accustomed to when eating at Korean restaurants. Is THAT too much to ask?   Here, the muscly bro that works the kitchen just flat out says \"No. Bibim bap needs beef.\" Whatever BRO. Have fun busing trays from your dive cafeteria beef factory, beefy McGee.   I can't say what the rest of the non-veggie items are like.  A friend who went there with me was \"unimpressed.\"   TWO STARS FOR YOU."}
{"text":"\"ethnic\" Korean food / just like what I used to have in Korea"}
{"text":"I have tried a couple of dishes here, and I find Chicken Stir-fry the best!  Vegetables are crispy, the sauce tasty, and chicken tender!  Just perfect!"}
{"text":"i always crave for korean food. i have tried all korean restaurants (except the most recent one) on campus, and i love food at woori jib the most. my favorite dish is chicken stir fry, which also comes with white rice. it looks spicy but it's not that spicy to me .. just perfect. i never have to ask for more rice, but I always do for kimchi :)  it's a little pricey but it's no difference from other korean restaurants. i think it's worth the price for the food they serve."}
{"text":"I've given this another chance... I have to update my review from two stars to one star... an (almost $10) SEAFOOD AND TOFU soup cannot have barely three pieces of tofu, some red pepper paste, lots of salt, lots of water and (I kid you not!) ONLY ONE MUSSEL inside. Yeah, that's their \"seafood soup\" now - no shrimp, no anything else... just ONE SINGLE LOUSY MUSSEL.   Greedy owner, incompetent  Mexican cook (the Korean owner used to be a decent chef, but now he slacks off and lets the Mexican guy do all the cooking), racist attitude. Yes, both Woori-Jib and B-Won seem to have this \"what are you doing here? You can't possible know what Holy Korean Food is about\" attitude if you're not Korean yourself. I haven't seen similar racism and superior attitudes in Chinese restaurants for example, not even in Japanese restaurants, which offer, on the average, food which is a lot more refined.   Shame on you, Woori Jib!"}
{"text":"Came here based on recommendations given by friend. I would give a 4 stars for the food. However I received awful service just because I did not hear them calling out my number. I was super disappointed with the way they acted. Super rude."}
{"text":"It took me awhile to try all the Korean restaurants on campus, and I'm sorry to say that this is my least favorite out of the many to choose from, I mean it's okay but I've had better. At first glance the place is a little small and has a very casual setting. There aren't many servers on hand, and it was not too busy when my party went in.  Now if you've been reading my reviews, I never judge a restaurant solely on experience, cause it's all about the food. I didn't mind the small size because it reminded me a family-style, close knit style of eating with friends and family.    The food was decent but not the best I've had. I ordered the spicy pork and got some tofu soup on the side.  When the food came out, the portion size was not as big as other restaurants like Ari-rang or Bwon and did not have much flavor to it. It was kinda bland and not as spicy as I would've like it. Now I remembered one of my friends telling me you could get umlimited soup, so I went to the little station they had set up and it was seaweed soup. The problem with it was that it tasted like water and no flavor at all, so besides it being unlimited, one bowl was enough for me. Everything else was pretty good, the ban chan was good and I enjoyed the free refills on everything, and tofu soup portions were actually of good size.   Overall, a pretty decent place, but I've had better Korean food on campus (and off-campus at Bwon) and would recommend trying those places first."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 4 years and I am never disappointed.  They have the best bi bim bop.  It is fantastic.  It is always a large portion and every ingredient is always so fresh.  I also love the chicken stir fry.  It is so well seasoned and has the perfect ratio of meat to veggies.  They are not stingy.    I have yet to try a dish on their menu that I do not enjoy.  I will continue to keep going here time and time again."}
{"text":"So you saw all the pictures people posted right? Looks good right? Mmm U can taste it already in your mouth...the hot spicey tofu soup, the bulgogi lunch combo...mmmm  I saw small little teeth marks on my kimchee that most likely was from a rat getting into the tub of kimchee in the back kitchen somewhere. These marks were not a half eaten kimchee cube from a human. I know what a half eaten kimchee cube looks like from a human. This was a pest.  I spit my food out. Got up and left. Didn't even bother reracking the food tray.  Never came back during my two year prison sentence in grad school."}
{"text":"Real authentic Korean food! It also gives the vibe of an actual Korean restaurant. Turns out, the owner has been in the Korean restaurant business for nearly 20 years and he really knows his stuff. Owner is a very friendly guy who treats his employees very well and the food is right on spot. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Compared to Korean food in other cities, the offerings in Champaign-Urbana are quite dismal.  Unfortunately, Woori Jib falls within this category.  Sampling of the \"standard fare\" (Bulgolgi, spicy tofu soup, mackerel, etc.) revealed that is food is not seasoned well, much of the BBQ is rather fatty, and overall quite \"rough\" and unappealing in appearance."}
{"text":"This is the bad experience ever! I ordered the raw fished over rice. It came out that raw fishes are frozen. And they told me that it's supposed to be like that!!! Omg that's ridiculous!!! I've had this dish at other restaurants. They just bullshit!!!! I'll never come to worijib again"}
{"text":"When I feel like sitting down to eat some Korean, Woori Jib is where I end up.  If you get the barbeque chicken, beef, pork (I always get chicken), you get free refills on everything except for the bbq'd meat, and they have soup you can help yourself to as well.  It all comes out to around $8.  Overall, I would say I like this place slightly more than Dorca's as I would come here to sit down and eat with friends as well as carry out.  Delicious, quick, filling, good location, awesome."}
{"text":"In general, most Champaign area Korean restaurants start out with bad service. This place is no different. After ordering your food, it typically takes 10-15 minutes to get your food, and it doesn't always come out in the same order as you ordered. On top of that, you'll often have other people that cut into line and get the same food that you ordered before they did.  On this occasion, I ordered duk mandu guk and it came with soggy seaweed in it. For the price of $10, it was a bit more expensive than other Korean restaurants in the area. In addition, it didn't taste spectacular to any degree. The only consolation was that it came in such a big bowl that I could take a little bit home for a leftover meal.  Another dish that is pretty popular is their BBQ bulgogi. It usually comes with a special sauce but it really depends on the day to figure out whether it's good or not. Sometimes, it's under cooked. Other times, it's over cooked and burnt. They also use about a 50% onion to 50% meat ratio so it seems like you are paying for a lot of onions and not a whole lot of meat.  The seating is usually crammed so during rush hours, it's hard to find a seat. There is very little room to back your seat out as seats are pretty much back to back."}
{"text":"There is no atmosphere, none, zip so don't come here if you're looking for a nice sit down Korean restaurant. It's a straight up cafeteria. You order your food at the front and then find a seat. They call your number and if you ordered two things, they will confusingly call the same number at different times depending on which dish is ready first. Also, it's very loud so they are basically yelling your number from the back. It seemed like a lot of Korean students were in here and I don't know why because the food was not very good. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing. I'm Korean and I've had decent Korean food before...but not from this place. Plus, I came with my baby in a car seat and this is not a place to bring a baby because there are no accommodations for one. And it's not that cheap. The food is normally priced if you ask me, roughly $10/plate. But hey, if you're looking for a cafeteria that serves okay-ish blahhh Korean food, then by all means, enjoy."}
{"text":"The place is very dirty, the food is not delicious and too salty (I know Korean food very well) and it is overpriced. There are several other Korean restaurants that have better food and ambience nearby. And the storeowner (an old man) is extremely rude to customers. I would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"When I go back to UofI, you can guarantee my first dinner will be Woori Jib.  This place got me through college.  Get the BBQ Beef (bulgogi)!  It's the best on campus by a large margin.  The bbq chicken and spicy pork are good too."}
{"text":"This was some excellent Bolgogi! The restaurant is small and pretty quiet. I take the silence to mean that everyone is eating and enjoying their food thoroughly. The BBQ was a little bit pricey at 10.99, but it is very filling and worth that amount."}
{"text":"Oh, how the U of I campus has changed since I've graduated and last visited five years ago.....but one restaurant hasn't disappeared......good 'ol Woori Jib!  Yes, it kinda looks like a dump in there.  Yes, there is no longer free soup.  Yes, the banchan tastes awful.  Yes, the service isn't exactly top notch.  But my goodness....that spicy chicken bulgogi dish tastes just as delicious as I last remembered it! *sparkly eyes*  Don't even try to order the non-spicy version. Spicy is the way to go because spiciness makes the crappiest dishes taste decent."}
{"text":"Decided to give this restaurant another try today, but I was disappointed again, even more than the last time I went. My friend ordered \"???????\" ?that is the CHINESE name written underneath the KOREAN name), and this means pork rib tofu soup translated into English. So my friend ordered this, but it turned out to be beef rib and she does not eat beef. She went to ask the workers for an exchange but they refused because she has already eaten the food. I don't know how else u can tell the difference between the two meat without tasting the food! In addition, the trays smelled like dishwash. I find it hard swallowing my food with this strong dishwash smell. Worst dining experience ever! If I could give this place no star I would."}
{"text":"Above average Korean food on the salty/spicy side. I guess everybody has a different experience, but I always thought that the service was pretty decent. The owner asks me how I'm doing in school and etc... Even though I've only seem him a few times."}
{"text":"Hole-in-the-wall restaurant of the lesser variety. Service is friendly, but that's about it. They don't take credit cards here, and my bibimbap was devoid of flavor. The other Korean restaurants on campus do it better."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place twice and have yet to find anything worth the money.  The first time I went, I had the BBQ chicken.  The chicken was good, but pricey for the little amount you get and the mediocre quality of it.  The second time, I had the bibimbap in the stone bowl.  The bibimbap was not as flavorful as I like (in fact, the bibimbap from ISR lunch has more flavor, just saying.) and my girlfriend's bibimbap was not hot at all."}
{"text":"Love their juicy beef rice but not the cold noodle. It's nice that  they have free spicy bean sprout soup all the time. Price is fair and service isn't bad."}
{"text":"Fairly standard Korean fair. Pretty tasty overall. Dishes are in the $9-$15 range.  I ordered the dolsot bibimbap and it was not bad. I was a bit surprised to see that the red pepper paste was already mixed in as I prefer to be able to mix it to my personal taste. Would come back."}
{"text":"For a college campus Korean restaurant, I think Woori Jib is the most genuine and the best in the area. It doesn't say much, but it counts.  I've enjoyed the galbi, cold buckwheat noodles, bibimbap, and many more dishes. They aren't bad. For a college student, it might be slightly pricey, but they've got to satisfy their cravings too, right?  Just don't compare Woori Jib to the Korean restaurants you grew up going to or to the Korean restaurants outside of Champaign, and you'll be content."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go on a cold winter day. The food is both spicy and warm. First I usually get a bowl of what seems to be miso soup, which is complimentary with your meal. They use really good meat for their spicy barbeque and it's delivered smoking hot to your table with bowls of kimchi and other Korean specialties. Some dishes might seem a little pricey, but most can easily feed two people"}
{"text":"Me and some friends got both the Chicken and the Beef. They were quick filling (2 meals for 3 of us was plenty). There is free soup and white rice with your meal as well. We ordered 'spicy' for both. The spicy was a nice medium level, but if you are at all intimidated by that, then go ahead and skip it."}
{"text":"pretty good food for the value and it's a very 'homie' atmosphere. my gf (who's caucasian) enjoys spicy food and asks for the spicy tofu soup. the cashier guy says, 'you probably won't like that.' she said, 'no it's ok i want that.' when she got her food, the soup wasn't spicy...  i thought it was pretty funny."}
{"text":"Looking for Korean BBQ (Bulgogi / Kalbi?) In my opinion this is the best place to go in urbana champaign. Portions are extremely generous, with free soup to start your meal, you cant go wrong. unlimited kimchi and rice and sauce also comes with every meal so if you are very hungry you can always refill on that stuff. Definitely a place I've been to multitude of times"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of local businesses, particularly \"ethnic\" mom and pops. But I'm afraid I don't quite understand the hype for Woori Jib--particularly given the higher prices. Word has it that the ribs are amazing. Call me a snob, but I'm afraid they were average at best. Same goes for most of the food in general, which could be on the fresher side in my opinion. A good sign of a Korean restaurant is the kimchi. Theirs, I'm afraid, barely gets a pass. I'm sorry."}
{"text":"The quality and size of food do not match the price. I ordered a bowl of soup with ribs and rice. The taste is fine, just fine. The ribs were so few and skinny. And the small dishes that you usually get in korean restaurant are so poor in woori jib. I only got like 3 pieces of kimgi. There are many other good restaurants around that place. I would not recommand this one."}
{"text":"Best Korean food near campus! Although on the relatively pricier end, the soon tofu soup (with adjustable spice level & meat choices), the bulgogi bbq (available in pork, chicken & beef), and the dolsot bibimbap are definitely more than worth the couple extra dollars!!! You can even ask for extra kimchi and rice for free if you need to :)   They have a pretty systematic ordering system that doesn't keep you waiting for too long either! Always a reliable, tasty & authentic go-to option!"}
{"text":"I usually like Woori Jib a lot, however, I had a bad experience today when I got an order to go. By the time it got home, the plastic lid on the container that had soup in it had melted. When I called in to report it and see what they would do, they just said \"we'll try to do better\" or something along those lines. I was disappointed with the customer service, they could have at least offered to replace it."}
{"text":"Ugh, went in for lunch today, and it was just plain disappointing. Had the pork bulgogi and it was greasy and bland. The onions were very undercooked as well. The rice was also cooked with too much water, making it mushy. I couldn't finish it. Either this dish just isn't good here, or there are consistency problems. Either way, last time I come here."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I was a little surprised to find this downtown but it was good. Very big portions, so I recommend sharing it with your friends. The bi bim bap came in a huge silver bowl, not a black cast iron pan, so the rice wasn't cooked crispy but the flavor was good and the hot sauce wasn't too spicy for the non-Korean (or none spicy) eater. The kalibi had a good flavor but the meat on the bones was a little tough.  It came together with a bowl of rice and some hot soup and of course a side dish of kimchi.  You order at the front counter and wait for them to call your name. It's self service and self busing afterwards. Quick, low key and easy to eat.  Good place for a tasty meal."}
{"text":"An convenient place to go and grab some Korean food to eat if you are around the campus. I recommend the grilled pork+vegetable salad and/or spicy tofu soups."}
{"text":"Love the food! I called in and ordered takeout and it was ready in 10-15 minutes! When I went to pick up my food, almost all of the tables were full, so you could tell that this was a popular place amongst students. I ordered gam ja tang (potato soup) and it was so good! The flavor of the soup was so hearty and was spicy enough. It was also wrapped really well, so that their was no chance of it spilling. The employees were working hard cooking and you could tell that they really cared about the food they put out.  Overall, I would definitely come here again if I ever want hearty Korean food!"}
{"text":"I live in New York now and this is still some of the best food I've ever had. I come here every so often. Sometimes not for years. But when I inevitably make my way back, my mouth salivates as I utter those sweet and tangy words \"chicken stir fry medium spicy.\" For that is truly what Beauty tastes like. A lovely medley of vegetables, rice that's the perfect buoyancy, chicken expertly prepared, mix in some friendly little rice cakes and shower it all in the best sauce to ever wash over the human tongue my friend. Spicy, of course, but paired with a sweetness that will just take you to the fair and when you the biggest prize on the shelf. The interior is unassuming and would otherwise not call out any of its greatness to the unsuspecting passerby, but secrets of passion, tasty, tasty passion await those who dare to see through the aesthetic.   The other food is also good"}
{"text":"Although there are not as many small plates of Korean kimchis here (actually, hardly any), I prefer the entrees as compared to Ar-ri-rang or B-Won. This place is always packed, so seating can be hard to come by, but it's worth it for tasty Korean food!"}
{"text":"Food was great, price was pretty much acceptable which was fair for students.   But the service was weak, me and my wife had to get food from window by ourselves. Then the tip screen pop up when we asked for check, I was like did you really serve us?  For mutual respect, i chose to pay 15% tips, but they didn't deserve.  However, Food was awesome, but you don't have to provide tips if they don't serve you!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and the portions can be small; I ordered the short ribs galbi and paid $18 for a \"large\" portion but it came in a small plate and most of the pieces were just bone. Soup and side dish of kimchi were both too salty."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Korean restaurants in Champaign! I always come here with friends and we really enjoy the food. The owners are super friendly and you can get free refills on rice. The only downside about coming here is that you leave smelling like food, so this isn't exactly the place to wear your Sunday's best, lol.   Dishes I've had and loved: -galbi (short ribs) -bibimbap -bulgogi -soon du bu with beef -chicken stir fry (new fav: i get it in a spicy sauce and it comes with veggies and rice cake)"}
{"text":"Not too bad but the food isn't that great. The owner is generous and nice but the place is little crowded and little messy. Overall, would not really recommend people to try the 'real' Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Some disagree, but I believe this is the best Korean food on campus.  My favorite is the Korean Barbecue.  It is a bit more expensive at $8, but it is definitely a solid meal.  You can get free rice and sauce refills by walking up to the kitchen with your bowl."}
{"text":"Other reviewers have described Woori Jib as a \"hole in the wall.\" It definitely is. The place is functional; it caters to the lunchtime campus crowd. The food isn't cheap (around $10-12 for an average lunch), but the place fills up. Most meals include a second bowl of rice for free and a side of kimchi (radish and cabbage style), which is good. The food is not elegant or fancy -- it is tasty, basic, and homestyle. To me, this is comfort food, the kind you might make yourself at home if you had the time (and tended toward Korean comforts).   The beef bulgogi comes out sizzling, with thin sliced and seared white onions. It has been marinated in a sweet soy sauce and this sweetness caramelizes nicely upon grilling. The portion is big and filling.  The manduguk has a chicken broth base, and includes loads of mild beef dumplings. As is traditional onions, scallions, and eggs flavor the broth with a little dash of dried kelp on top.  The dolsot bibimbap is yummy. The meat was not marinated beef in strips, as I've had in the past, but ground beef (that was just okay). The mixed, steamed veggies and the chili paste with fried egg on top were delicious mixed with the crisped rice on the bottom. All that was finished just right.  Just to clarify what I've seen in other reviews, when you go in, your whole table orders at the counter together and is given a shared number. When someone from your table has an order up, your number is called. It may be called several times, at different points. If you order a dish that takes longer to prepare than others (like the manduguk) you will find other numbers higher than your own being called. These folks aren't cutting in line -- it's just part of the kitchen's process.  Once you pick up your order, you will stop by a side table near the counter to get your silverware / chopsticks, etc. When you have finished, you return to the front on the other side with your tray, which you place in a cafeteria cart. Efficient, no frills, but relatively fast even on busy days (15-20 minutes to get served something cooked up fresh to order).  BTW, I've also heard some reviewers writing in to say they feel they've been treated differently because they weren't Korean. I am a Caucasian American and have felt well treated at Woori Jib. Yes, the cashier has assumed on occasion that I and the white people in line behind me are eating together because, well, white. But that's no big deal. The owner thanks me after every stop and the cashiers have helped me to explore and order."}
{"text":"It seemed to be a popular place and many people like their food. But today I want to talk about their service.  I ordered a normal stir fry to go at around 11 when they just opened. I am among the first group of people who ordered and I was #15. Then after around ten to fifteen minutes, meals are starting to coming out, which have numbers before me. After a while meals with order number (around 18-25) after me are also coming out so I was a little curious what was going on. But I thought maybe because I ordered to go and it takes longer time. And I waited and waited until I've been waiting for around 25 minutes. I went to ask the cashier if my meal was ready since I'm number 15 and people after me are getting their meals and she just said it's being cooking. Then I waited and meal number 30 and after are coming out. I was a little annoyed. I mean who will expect to order a to go meal at a normal average restaurant (not those fancy ones) and wait for half an hour and still hasn't got the food? But I kept waiting until number 33 was out and it was a to go meal. This time I was really pissed off. I went to talks to the cashier and the cook. And they all said \"it's coming right away!\" I said I've been waiting for more than half an hour and people after me are getting their meals. What's wrong with everything? And they just said it takes longer time to prepare. Please, I've been there before and asked for stir fry to go. It never takes this long. And they didn't say anything to explain but just said it took longer to prepare. And after I've been waiting for almost 40 minutes my meal was finally ready. Seriously, if they forgot to cook my meal and that results in me waiting for so long, you can just be honest and tell me the truth. I would accept any sincere apologies. Instead they just blamed the cooking process. And it's not going to fool anyone. It will only cause them to lose their customers. I give one star just for the food. I would give negative score for their services. Plus the environment is not that clean. And the hallway leading to restrooms smells like a garage stacking with raw meat, which is really gross."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, I wish there was something comparable in Chicago.  Good variation, flavor, and fast food style.  Entrees are around $9-$10.  The nangmeouyn is the best i've ever tasted hands down!!!"}
{"text":"The bulgogi here is good, but I didn't like the bibimbop.  I thought that the restaurant itself was very small and dirty so I recommend getting carryout.  There aren't many Korean restaurants on campus and of the ones there, this is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Korean restaurant when I attended UofI. Their kimchi jjigae is amazing!"}
{"text":"Always happy to eat at Woori Jib! It's such a great Korean restaurant centrally located on campus and I usually come between 2-3 times a week.  The setting is quite crowded and during peak hours (12:30-1 and dinner time) can be difficult to find seating, but the staff is relatively friendly and when you become a regular, ordering is super quick.  My favorites in order: Soon Tofu Jigae with beef (spicy, but they offer a mild and non-spicy version as well) -this has amazing flavor that combines soft tofu, onions (the onions are cooked soft and aren't overpowering), spring onions, mushrooms, your choice of meat, and spicy korean flakes. SO GOOD! It's served with a bowl of rice and some kimchi. $10.91 and you feel completely full after. Dolsot Bibimbap (dolsot is just a hot bowl, the regular metal bowl version is fine too) -I'm a fan of bibimbap and I think theirs tastes relatively good! I really like it for the portion size though ;) Spicy Bulgogi  -a classic! a little on the sweet side, and it's cooked with onions. my only gripe is that there's not much nutrition  The prices are slightly higher than preferred on a college campus, but the portion sizes are generous and the flavor is (obviously) why I come back. And their rice is on point!"}
{"text":"It is the third time they forgot my order and it is the final weekI should say that the taste is ok but they really need some management and be well-organized. Last time they forgot my order and I wait for more than half an hour then got late for my course and the professor took attendance. If you are in a rush, never choose this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've honestly never been so horrified at a restaurant in my entire life. For starters, I have life-threatening allergies, and have to avoid certain allergens such as egg in my orders. I have ordered from every Korean restaurant in Champaign-Urbana multiple times over the past few years, and never has a restaurant screwed up my order (it's not complicated, it merely entails leaving an egg out of soup) so many times than this place. They even have the audacity to retort that I never mentioned taking the egg out, so I had resorted to voice recording my orders so they can't say otherwise. That was fine and all, but this time, I was very insistent on leaving the egg out of the soup (as I had been very sick previously and couldn't afford another hospital trip), and they assured me that there was no egg in it whatsoever after I picked it up. After driving over 20 minutes back to my house, I open it up to see obvious small yellow egg yolk fragments scattered throughout the tofu. It was clear that they had put it in, realized their mistake, and merely scooped it out. Obviously, that doesn't fly with food allergies (any cross contamination can result in hospitalization). Moreover, they had blatantly lied and said there was no egg in the soup when they had undeniably put it in. When I called to complain and ask for a remake, they refused to do so, continuing to lie and insist that they put no egg in. (I've had to avoid egg for all my life, it's offensive to imply I don't know what it looks like). The owner then starts bellowing at me in the rudest tone imaginable, and hangs up while I'm calmly trying to explain the situation. We drove all the way back to the restaurant because they refused to deliver to us and compensate for their mistake (keeping in mind that this back and forth has already taken over an hour out of the day), and the owner continues to lie in person. He even trashes the evidence right away as soon as we bring the soup in. It wasn't until we showed them that we had unmistakeable photo evidence of the egg that he finally gave in. This wasn't even the worst part: while we were requesting a remake, he was repeatedly screaming the word \"die\" at us and making obscene slicing motions at his throat (as if slashing it). It was bad enough to have jeopardized a customer's life simply because he was too lazy/cheap to remake it, he goes even further to threaten us and tell us to go die, literally. All we wanted from the very beginning was a simple apology and refund/remake, and his bloated pride was too stingy to give a loyal customer even that. Life-threatening food allergies are such an important concept for restaurants to be conscious of, and so is civilized human behavior (aka not yelling at customers to go die). The owner of this place is honestly one of the most prideful, horrendous men I've ever encountered; please take your money elsewhere. Their food, inhumane service, and continually failed sanitation tests-which are all visible online-are truly not worth it."}
{"text":"Definately pricier than what I would pay for in the city but their food was pretty good.  Service was quick and simple - more like a fast food Korean joint.  THeir kimchi was typical but still good.  Their bulgogi was a bit saltier than what I'm used to.  My friend had this omelette looking dish but inside was fried rice which looked pretty yummy."}
{"text":"I gotta say this place really intimidated me at first because I was the only non-asian in the place at the time and the menu does not seem to cater towards English speakers.  However, their hotspots are phenomenal and full of flavor.  I love how the hotspots come out of the kitchen still boiling.  I have been here twice I like the clear broth spare rib hot pot the best although the Kim chi based soups are really good as well.  Expect to pay about $12 but it's worth it at least once.  Very casual place expect to see a lot of Koreans!"}
{"text":"This place gets really crowded during peak hours. I went here twice in the past couple of months: the first time I got pork stir fry, which was tasty but a bit too heavy on sauces. The second time I had hwae naeng myun, spicy mixed cold noodles with sashimi. It had way too much sauce on it to the point of being overwhelming.  Overall I would stick to the stir fries and bulgogis. The food is a bit on the pricey side, but I'd be willing to give Woorijib another chance if the food is less saucey."}
{"text":"No frills self serve Korean restaurant with great food. Boyfriend and I ordered the hot bibimbab and seafood tofu. Delicious, plenty of vegetables and seafood, right amount of spice, and food stayed hot until the end. Free kimichi, no more free soup.  Given the portion sizes, filling up is not a problem.  With styrofoam water cups and simple decor, this is the place to get great tasting authentic Korean food, not an upscale date night place.  The price is average for Korean food."}
{"text":"I've been a longtime conoisseur of Korean food, and this place is just awesome.  Definitely my favorite Korean restaurant in Champaign-Urbana, very authentic and down-to-earth.  The older couple that runs it is always there, considerate and hard-working.  The counter staff has always been very polite and helpful.  My favorite dish by far is the BBQ fresh bacon (I recommend this HIGHLY), but all of the dishes I've had from Woori Jib have been delicious.  The stir fried dishes come in large portions and have a nice mix of vegetables along with the meat.  The tofu stew is also very good combined with any meat, but is pretty spicy if ordered above mild, so bear this in mind.  The grilled fishes are salty and cooked just right.  The dumplings have a hand-made form and taste.  The kim chee is not as varied as at some restaurants, but also tastes \"fresh\" (as fresh as kim chee should be) and home-made.  If you do have a wait (which is common for any BBQ dishes made to order, at any restaurant), the cabbage soup is there, waiting for you. I'm not particular about ambience, so I don't mind that Woori Jib is a bit like a cafeteria.  I'm all about the food and the prices, and those are both excellent at Woori Jib!"}
{"text":"They forgot my order so I ended up sitting there for 20 minutes until I asked them what was going on.   The beef bulgogi was good and the cashier was cute though."}
{"text":"worst service ever!  I ordered the grilled gabi and it is overcooked. I returned the dish and they just pick the black ones out and gave me the previous one."}
{"text":"Went there again. This time I ordered beef with rice noodle soup to go. And it came out well packed! Just love the favor of the soup!"}
{"text":"Beef is really good. I tried several other options but failed. Anyway, the taste is not bad and not  wonderful. People could have a try there."}
{"text":"Probably one of the unforgettable part of my college life. Great food, friendly people, and always crowded. Their bulgogi is on the sweeter side, and gojuchang based rather than soy sauce based. They never forget to use LOTS of onions, which really adds a great flavor to the meat.  My go-to dishes are: - Spicy Pork bulgogi - Samgye-tang (ginseng chicken soup) - Soon Tofu Jigae  Their price point are a bit expensive relative to the restaurants around the area, but you know why once you tasted their food.  They now use square for method of payment, which really make their process more efficient and reduce the long queue during peak hours."}
{"text":"Hard to find an authentic korean place in town and this is def one.   They are a little pricy with not a lot of lunch specials.   I order the kimchee with some spicy pork cooked together. Forgot wat it is called but absolutely hot and delicious."}
{"text":"For those of you students who are thinking of taking jobs at St. Louis and hold Woori Jib as a standard for good grilled meat....  Don't move to St. Louis... or at least plan on making random trips back for Woori Jib / Papa Dels / Pokey Stix."}
{"text":"its a dive alright.  very loud with the kitchen all yelling orders at once. I had the bibimbop, which was ok and they do use ground beef.  in a pinch its fine for when you crave korean."}
{"text":"worst naeng myun (cold noodle) I ever had.  Even with 9 gallons of mustard, and vinegar, it still tasted pretty bad.  The staff seemed nice, but the food was sub-par.  Maybe naeng myun is not their specialty.  I've had enough korean food to know what it should taste like, (my wife is korean).  What I can't figure out, is why is it so popular with all the college students? We had bulgogi that was soggy as hell too.  I've had bulgogi in korea plenty of times, and its never soggy like this?"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. I ordered beef bulgogi. The service was fairly quick in the heart of lunch hour and the bulgogi was good. A tad on the greasy side, but otherwise good. There are so many options for Korean food on campus but I'm glad to have found another place that makes a solid beef bulgogi!"}
{"text":"Best tofu soup I've ever had! When I asked for vegetables instead of meat the guy taking orders wasn't sure if that was possible, neither did the kitchen staff ... but the older man who appeared to be the owner got up from his break specifically to make it for me. Great service and delicious!"}
{"text":"I tried out their tofu stir fry. They sure have a way with food because it stays relatively hot the entire time you're eating it. The food was average, but they do give you a pretty hefty amount."}
{"text":"This is probably the only good korean restaurant on campus, but it is a bit pricey compared to the rest. Their chicken bokkeum is really good (get it spicy!), the soups are pretty good (galbi tang, soon doo bu tofu soup) and their rice bowls are fantastic (bibimbap and dolsot bibimbop in the stone bowl). The sauce is pretty spicy though, so if you normally don't like spicy, get it on the side. Actually, if you don't like spicy food don't get it at all; it's not the same without the sauce. The bulgogi (korean beef) actually isn't the greatest (even though so many say it's fantastic). It's a little too dry, and the marinade could be better. Everything else is really good though; definitely get the free soup (it's always pretty good) and the kimchi and sardines that come with every dish are really good too. Don't be scared of the little fish, just try it."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Champaign hands down. Other Korean restaurants do not have an indoor GRILL so the meat cannot be compared to Woori Jib!!!!  The soups and other dishes are also amazing!!! I've been in Champaign for a long time now and have gone to Woori Jib religiously and its always delicious. If you don't know what to get, start with the BBQ beef or Kalbi (BBQ beef short rib). Go see for yourself, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Many of their dishes are still average, but I branched out and had their grilled mackerel on my last visit - Oh. My.  God.  It was DELICIOUS!  So apparently if you order things on the menu that most Americans wouldn't, the food is awesome."}
{"text":"This is not Korean food. It's not even mediocre Korean food. It is just a bad restaurant.  My boyfriend and I went here and I ordered the Kalbi. I paid $12.00 and was stunned when it came out. My meat was mostly fat and bones, and there was not even one serving of meat. The soybean soup was simply gritty and tasted like it came from a cheap pre-made mix. They only gave me two pieces of kakdugi and three meagre slices of kimchi.   Most Korean restaurants, for $12.00 you get five of six banchan (side dishes). If you want to really experience Korean food, go to Good Fellas. For slightly more, you get the full meal and refills on banchan. And they definitely don't charge you $12.00 for bones and fat."}
{"text":"I love how Yelp has removed my first post.   Either way, what I would like to say is I have seen the owners of this place reuse their food (kimchi) and put it on other plates.  I had the cold noodle soup and it wasn't good. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is really good, the service is quick, and the prices are pretty cheap!  The barbeque is definitely what sets it apart from the other Korean restaurants on campus, but they also have a lot of other great dishes like the dolsat bibimbap.  Mmm.  I definitely come here probably too much for it to be normal haha."}
{"text":"It's above average Korean food served at a fast pace and right off Green St. What else more do you want, you ungrateful children?"}
{"text":"The lure of unlimited rice refills & homemade banchan made Woori Jib our first stop in Champaign after hauling all of our belongings halfway across the country & subsisting off of salads from Costco.   Woori Jib clearly caters to the hungry college crowd - you place your order up front, pick up utensils, water, & free soup to the right, then snag a table & wait until your order is called out.  After you're done with your meal, you do have to bus your own table a la Ikea style.   While Woori Jib is a little pricier than the other local Korean restaurants, it also ranks as one of the highest ones.  The meat-centric dishes will knock you back $10-$12, but you will certainly get what you paid for.  I've had the divinely tender Galbi Ribs & the charred Pork Belly, while the boyfriend is loyal to the Spicy Pork Bulgogi (the only downside is that half the dish was onions). The portion sizes are quite generous, where you can certainly split an entree to feed 2 people with the add cost of $2 for unlimited rice for both, or pack up the other half for some tasty leftovers!  *They accept Visa & Mastercard along with cash."}
{"text":"Probably the best Korean in town.  Expensive but so is Ah-ri-rang (their competitor).  This place introduced me to korean food so I can recommend it for people looking to try korean.  They have unlimited soup (jigae?) and hot/cold water to make tea with if you want to don't miss that.  If you're more adventurous try a Jigae (korean stew) or Dolcet Bibim Bop.  If you're lame then get Bulgoki like everyone else :-p"}
{"text":"I don't understand how people can come here and only order one thing. I loveee getting their bulgogi and seafood soondooboo! SO GOOD. I can never find anywhere that has better bugogi than here. I think it's because they actually use a grill for the meat. AMAZING. On top of that, the owner is SO nice. Always has a smile and is asking how my day is. Can't go wrong with this place :)"}
{"text":"Bulgogi is the bomb here! Definitely recommend!!  Only gave four stars because there restroom is just atrocious... almost threw up upon entering..."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best Korean restaurants here in Champaign. I really enjoyed the Pork Stir Fry and the Pork Bulgogi. While the dishes are slightly overpriced, I feel that the serving portions are quite large. Woori Jib had a very unique dipping sauce, which I felt complimented my Bulgogi. In addition to your meal, you receive tiny dishes of kimchi and other vegetables. Overall, I do recommend this place to anyone in Champaign interested in getting Korean food."}
{"text":"It takes nearly half hour to get my food.  But have to say, it tastes really good. Love the grilled bacon  they have here so much."}
{"text":"Woori Jib has 2 versions of bulgogi - barbequed/grilled and pan cooked. I think their grilled bulgogi definitely sets them apart from other Korean restaurants in town. It is delicious. Their menu is not as extensive as Dorcas though."}
{"text":"I was finally able to give this place a shot today and I was very disappointed. Prior to eating here, I knew from other reviews that the service wasn't the best, but I wanted to go to the restraunt without letting this info skew my opinion. However, I got there and received some of the worst service I've ever gotten. Right off the bat, the young man at the counter was not welcoming at all - it seemed like he didn't want to be working. I asked him if there were any sections for lunch specials in the menu because I saw \"lunch special!\" written on one of the laminated pictures, and he rudely replied with \"no lunch specials.\" Okay then...  I paid with my debit card and they do it with an iPad, making you pay tip while they're pointing the iPad at you, which I thought was a bit rude. I gave 15% but I shouldn't have because this guy was extremely rude and they don't serve you at all. It's all self service. Also, I asked for no onions in general for my tofu soup, but when I received my food, there were green onions on top. So I said I had asked for no onions and the guy that took my order first gave me attitude saying \"that's not onions, you didnt tell me no green onions, you just said onions.\" And I replied with, \"they're still onions... I said no onions, I thought that was very clear.\" And he replied with \"you need to specify what you want.\" And I just shrugged it off and was already annoyed with him at this point where I just took the food because I didn't want anymore trouble, and the woman who gave me my food asked the guy as I was leaving if I had an onion allergy where he replied to her saying I had none, I just didn't like them. This was so rude because he doesn't know me (what if I did have allergies) nor was it necessary for him to make it my fault that I didn't specify what kind of onions I didn't want, when I didn't know there were two different types of onions in the soup.   So needless to say, I probably won't be returning to the restaurant unless I'm having a huge craving for their mediocre korean food."}
{"text":"words cannot describe my love for this place. I have been to korea... and I have no had better soondubu than this place. I know a lot of people say they add a TON of MSG in their food... but I'm okay with that as long as it taste as good as this.  Suggestions: - Chicken Noodle Soup - soondubu jjigae (with galbi)  - Stir fry (very big portions) - Galbi (taste amazing but portion size have gotten signif smaller) - Duk buk gi (they might have changed up the recipe a bit cuz i looked different now) - CALL AHEAD and place ur order ot avoid the long wait. - GRAB A TABLE the minute you step in that place because they'll get pretty packed around meal time - they are closed on Sunday so keep that in mind.  - Oh and you can ask for second bowl of rice - ps. they got rid of the soup thing they put outside now.. but it didn't taste good anyways"}
{"text":"Restaurant review I don't know why this place has gotten such high reviews, but my meal went south very quickly. Some tips, there is NO FREE soup any longer. When you go order they placed it through an ipad. One of the questions is whether to tip 15-25%. Just click no. This is a self serve restaurant from picking up your food to depositing your tray. There is no reason to tip and this just by default. I was craving some other korean dish which was not available here. I went to the kalbi, unfortunately I made the mistake of ordering one that was a stir fry version of kalbi. There was vegetables and it was a soaking mess. I have no idea were my dish went wrong. Small amount of beef, lots of vegetables. Tables are very cramped and the prices are not cheap. My kalbi dish cost 12+ dollars. Overall a big let down, this is a big step below K-bowl which is leading my Korean food experience in champaign.  Pros: Unlimited rice  Cons: Expensive for the quality of food, small spaces, sub-par food  Hidden deals: Make sure you don't hit the tip button. This is a SELF-SERVE restaurant"}
