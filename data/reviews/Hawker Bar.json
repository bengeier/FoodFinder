{"text":"I'd say it's a 3.5/5 Review.

I discovered Hawker Bar one day as I passed by the Ossington strip learning that the Crepe place that was there before had closed down.

Tables are seated with tall barstools or re-purposed tree stumps used as seats; Not the most comfortable but he decor is somewhat to be expected from trendy Ossington. I do appreciate that they now added a bench by the window which looks a lot more comfortable than those stumps.

Since my first visit to Hawker Bar I've visited it at least 4-5 more times; so my review will primarily be about my food experiences in each of my visits.

In my first visit I was greeted and seated with cardboard menus; the menu itself isn't very big on selections but it offers a wide enough variety for an establishment of this scale. Upon looking at the menu I was immediately drawn to the Hainanese Chicken Rice dish. I've had this dish before in other \"Asian\" restaurants and it's usually a pretty safe and tasty dish. Needless to say the poached chicken was succelent and juicy, and the accompanying sauces (sticky sweet soy and homemade chili sauce) paired very well with the dish. I finished my meal with dessert, the ice Kacang. It was interesting eating flavoured bits of ice from various syrups, which would be new experience to some. I, on the otherhand, was neither impressed nor unimpressed by it.

On my next visit, I was a little bit more adventurous and tried their seafood special which was a whole deep fried Sea Bream drizzled with sticky soy sauce and paired with a Banana Blossom slaw. The fish was very meaty and juicy also and the slaw provided a much needed crisp that contrast with the crunchy fish.

On my third visit I decided to try the Hawker Laksa Lemak, a coconut curry soup with rice noodles, snow peas, eggplant, red pepper and puffy tofu; and I added chicken to mine. This dish however wasn't as exciting for me. I found the coconut soup a little too tart that it was hard to really distinguish the flavours of the other ingredients.

On my fourth visit I ordered the Rendang Curry which had coconut rice and braised ox cheeks. Before ordering I remembered my experience with the Laksa Lemak and inquired whether it used the same curry base. The server happily helped me adjust the curry to a flavour I could enjoy more which I greatly appreciated. However, I found that in general I wasn't a fan of the coconut rice, and it was too dessert-like for my tastes. It was a great dish all around, but it wasn't suitable to my palette.

On my fifth visit, I decided to try another of their seafood dishes, the \"Singapore style\" noodles. This is a twist another very safe and common asian dish, but I found it was a very alluring innovation. The shrimps are juicy and plump, the noodles were tossed in a very flavourful range of spices, it was certainly a delight to eat.

Finally in my most recent visit I had went back to try the Hainanese Chicken again. This time I ordered a side of Yellow Soy broccoli to broaden my diet. The broccoli itself was a bit disappointing. The soy mixture is flavourful and reminded me of miso, however the way they prepared the broccoli seemed lacking. It was explained to me that they boil the broccoli then sautee it with the sauce I assume. However, it seemed the boiling process may have made the broccoli lose it's crispiness/crunchiness. I think the dish would have been more successful with a little less boiling to remain a firmer texture for the broccoli.

All in all, I love the new addition of Hawkerbar to the Ossington strip. It provides a very different type of menu to the area and I always try to recommend people to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how close to authentic \"Singapore street food\" Hawker is, nor do I really care.  The food here is delicious!    The space is small, warm, lively, and inviting.  The kind of place where you want to linger and have another drink and chat some more.   As others mentioned, it is very small, and would not be suitable for large groups, or for children, as it has more of a bar vibe.  I had the the vegan laksa lemak and it was bursting with flavour.  Also had the chili salt tofu to start, also great.  Sapporo on tap was ice cold and went down easy.  I'm more of a beer girl, but they had a lot of delicious looking cocktails as well.  My sister had the \"fresh material\" and it was tasty.   As with anywhere on the Oss strip, I imagine this place can get quite douchey on a weekend.  I think it's a great week night choice, or maybe for an early weekend dinner."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Hawker Bar since it opened and my honest opinion is that the food is getting worse every year. My two favorite items on the menu are no longer tasty. The chicken wings used to be the best wings I've ever eaten and now they are lacking in flavor except for the strong cooking soy that they now give you to dip them in. My other former favorite was the laksa that used to be a huge bowl of deliciously flavored thick broth with an egg, chicken, tofu, veggies, herbs and noodles. Now it's about 1 cup of fishy broth with a few bean sprouts and noodles for $13. I'm so disappointed and will not order my go-to dishes again."}
{"text":"this is a cosy place that should bill itself as modernized, or even as an asian fusion place appealing to a wider palette. come here for the great ambience and service but not so much for the cuisine. that said, we should give it a year for the chef to settle in his vision and for kitchen staff to pick up on operations"}
{"text":"Real nice, amazing snacks (had the wings and tofu), good drinks. The service is slow on the weekends because it's usually one server slugging it out (kudos to them) but I will definitely be back, soon."}
{"text":"Having eaten Malaysian and Singaporean food throughout my life, I'm always excited by more options available in the city. So upon hearing about Hawker Bar, I knew I had to go. Maybe even bring my family - if I dared.

So I went with some friends who'd travelled in SE Asia before running the gauntlet with my family, and I was so glad I did (or I'd have never heard the end of it):

THE GOOD
I enjoyed their salt & spicy tofu cubes, as well as their other tofu dish. Both had good flavours and textures. The fish special was crisp and fried and presented well. A wee bit overdone, but that's a minor quibble. The pandan banana dessert was also tasty, though I did want more pandan - love that aromatic leaf! Prices are also really reasonable.

THE BAD
The Hainanese Chicken rice was a sad thing of boiled - not poached - chicken. Rendang was saucy - and done with a sweet Thai-like coconut curry. I'm pretty sure that's not how it's done in Singapore. My ice kachung was mostly ice and very little toppings. Laksa was... thin and missing that lovely viscosity.

If you're looking for authentic Singaporean food, then Hawker Bar is not the place to do it. I wondered how two chefs who went to Australia for 2 years could come back and give us those crazy-good flavours of Singapore, but I was hopeful - I mean, there's a big Malay/Sing population there! Alas, the flavours are all off - too much ginger, not enough taste, mushy rice. Please go visit Lion City, Restoran Malaysia, and Gourmet Garden for the tastes of Singapore in Toronto. Phoenix also does an okay Chicken Rice."}
{"text":"So was so excited to go have food from Singapore since I love it when i'm there but was quite disappointed in the food at Hawker bar.  The hainese chicken had no flavor and not cut correctly nor did the rice have flavor: http://steamykitchen.com/5068-hainanese-chicken-rice.html  Here is a great recipe that makes sure the chicken has flavor....the skin here tasted horrible.  Not like in singapore as the server said. The shrimp dumplings also smelled and tasted bad and without flavor. The Chicken Satay was full of fat...why would I want to satayed fat?  The nasi goreng was decent but could have more vegies.  Singapore noodles also not great and not worth the $16 especially for the portion and the flavor.  The only thing that was good was the lamb potstickers.  They had taste and the mint sauce was decent.  The cocktails were expensive and barely could taste any alcohol in it.  I would say that I wouldn't go there again for food but only if we were meeting people for drinks...and they had a limited wine list as well.  We ordered two different bottles of red and they were ok but pricey.  The bathrooms are great though.  Oh, we had the fried tofu and it was ok but not worth the price for the amount...felt it for that price it should have more. 

so not a great first visit.  Server was great, attentive to our needs...i think he was interested in one of my friends as he kept staring at her when he come over! 

now off to search for some real Singaporean food in the city....http://awol.junkee.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-singapores-hawker-food/24523"}
{"text":"Was very impressed by my first visit here. Thanks to the ossington strip attracting a later crowd we were seated right away around 7:45 on a saturday night. By 8:30-9 there was a wait for a table. Its a small restaurant so good for 2-4 people, would not recommend bring a group bigger than 4. 

Food:
chili salt tofu was delicious. just right amount of crispiness. 
Lhaksa. Great flavor but just a tad too spicy in our opinion.  you can choose your protein- chicken, shrimp, veggie, but I like that the chicken and shrimp ones still had lots of vegetables. I had the shrimp which was a delicious. It tasted like the shrimp had been barbequed first and it was so tasty. 
Chicken wings - sauce was excellent
Dumplings - i didn't try these but my husband was very meh about them. He wouldn't order them again based on how delicious everything else was. 


For the price, we were also very impressed by the presentation. The chili salt tofu had some leaves and chili peppers arranged very nicely on top and the cucumber salad we saw going to other tables was also plated nicely. Usually at this price range I don't expect my food to be plated

Staff and Food were quick and efficient. When my husband asked about a local beer he didn't know they immediately offered him a free sample. 

Will definitely return to try more of the dishes."}
{"text":"Their chicken wing was very good but I tried the Singaporean noodle and it wasn't as good. I love the ambient and the environment there though. It's great place to take someone out on a date."}
{"text":"Dropped into Hawkers bar on a Wednesday evening in prime dinner hour and managed to secure the last seating for 4 for the evening. The atmosphere in the restaurant was relaxed. I liked the decor, I especially liked the lighting, to me was reminiscent of being outdoors in a real hawkers alley.

We ordered the shrimp and ginger dumplings to start, these were very flavourful and delicious, we wished we had ordered more, We also ordered the deep fried fish, which was on the specials menu, which I would highly recommend, great flavour. We also shared the Rendang Curry, Silken Tofu and the Chicken Laksa. All were fantastic and didn't disappoint, I was very excited to try the Laksa as this is one of my favourite noodle dishes and the Laksa at Hawkers Bar did not disappoint.

We also tried the fried banana dessert which was nice.

Overall a great experience, great staff, fantastic food, I would defiantly recommend all to try and will return another day!"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and heard goods words about them somewhere else, as a fan of Singapore food I was excited to give it a try.

We went there 11pm and the place was full, after a bit wait we got a corner seat. It's a cute place with cute decor, but depends on the seat we got, it sure wasn't a comfortable place to stay long, especially in winter: we had to put our coat on our lap for the entire meal. It wasn't until we finished,  I found that they have a coat rack at the very end of the dinning room.

The service was good, girls were friendly and helpful. It was a bit loud to have continuous conversations though. Their punch was meh, the beer our server recommended was really good, forgot what it called, something hope lol.

We got:
Son-in-law eggs -- Definitely like it, the combination of different textures and flavours were amazing. But $7 for two boiled-deep fried eggs with some spice and plum paste was a bit steep for me.

Chicken wings -- It was different than most wings we have in town, a good combination of Asian and western flavour. It was all drum stick, and we finished it pretty quickly. However, as a heavy spicy food lover, it's far too plain, and a bit too sweet. 

Hainanese Chicken -- Loved it, but gotta agree with my friend, their chicken was too plain. Really love the rice it came with, a perfect coconuty rice which showed Hawker put in thoughts and effort in their food. The chicken, did not have any special taste it should as a \"hainanese chicken\", without the sauces (which were really good) that it came with it's just too plain.

Laksa: I love Laksa in Singapore, that's part of the reason why I was so interested in this place. We ordered medium chicken laksa, $10. To be honest, I was surprised by the portion, it was the small size in my expectation that we got. I am an individual who has a very high tolerance when it comes to the price I pay for food, but I was still a bit surprised. To treat it as a main, I would prob need a large.
Okay the flavour. Generally my stomach loved it, it was spicy enough, and very rich (seems to be richer than the ones I had tho). Only thing with the flavour was it's too sweet, other than that, this place will be on my list next time my cravings for laksa happens.

I wouldn't say this place was not worth trying, but I prob won't go all the way there just for them again."}
{"text":"Small and loud, loud, loud (like people screaming at each other at their tables because they're so excited to have their friend's attention loud). It's my own fault, since I suspected this is what it would be like before I went there. I'm just not down with the pretentious hipster scene.

I had the stingray, which was prepared excellently. However, it was just stingray, with a gingery sambal. After 10 bites of exactly the same flavour,  I kinda lost interest. Maybe better to share the two pieces and get something else. Def worth trying if you have any curiosity about it. Silken tofu app was really good too. 

Staff were welcoming, attentive but unobtrusive. Got there at 7:30 on a Friday night, no wait for 2 people. 4 people waiting when we left at 9. 

The chairs are tree stumps with no backs. Pretty but if you have any back issues, might not be for you.

Food's a 4, noise level's a 1."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night during Summerlicious and was blown away by both the food and service. 

We had an 8pm reservation and were seated right away (even though the place was quite busy). Servers were attentive throughout the night - refilling water, clearing plates and asking if we wanted more drinks (the most important part!).

Sometimes Summerlicious food is bland and very clearly pre-packaged/prepared en masse, but that wasn't the case here. Everything here was flavorful, seasoned well and the portions were perfect (we had the shrimp laksa, dumpling platter, chicken + ribs, surf + turf and desserts). Would absolutely come back when their regular menu is available to try other things.

The cocktails were reasonably priced for downtown Toronto, strong, and delicious.

The staff were really friendly, and the ambiance was perfect. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend and were the only people in the resto. We shared the son in law eggs, and I got the chicken laksa. The waitress kindly explained all the components to the son in law eggs and they were very yummy. My laksa was a good size for lunch and had a lot of veggies and chicken in it. However it has really little noodles. I gave this place 3 stars because food was good but it was pricey for what it was. The friend I came with is from Singapore and she agrees with me that the food is decent but it hurts her a little to be paying $12 for laksa when it's like $5 back home."}
{"text":"One word: Stingray. To die for! Loved it! Never had it? Try it! Literally tasted like fish, like sea bass. Yum!

I loved their cocktails! I feel like every time I was lucky enough to get a table or seat at the bar at this place to eat is like it is my birthday! lol no joke. I love Hainan Chicken Rice and this place has the best one. The best one. Oh man soo good. And try their Son in Law eggs. No jokes. I had these in Thailand and have never seen them anywhere outside of Thailand. Imagine my surprise and excitement! 

There's nothing on this menu I don't love."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking forward to this Ossington restaurant because one of them is from Singapore, the cuisine that inspired Hawker Bar to open. She was regaling us with mouthwatering description of her native dishes and we were all very excited to try. 
Upon stepping in the restaurant, we really like the hip vibes and quaint atmosphere which seemed like a great place to grab drinks and dinner with friends. 

We ordered the son in law eggs and since I've never tried it I really like the flavour profile of sweet and sour spiciness; I think it'll make a good snack! Another dish I tried is laksa which is also a spicy sour dish but I found it quite similar to Tom Yum Gong a Thai soup which was somewhat disappointing. A staple of Singaporean cuisine and a must try is the Hainanese chicken rice which was poorly prepared - with overcooked chicken rendering its texture dry and stringy, and the rice was bland without the hallmark flavour of rich chicken fat cooked with it. 

To accompany our dishes, we ordered satay which as grilled meat skewers in the Southeast Asian region. For four skewers that were overcooked, dry, almost tasteless and drenched in superfluous and unnecessary sauce, it was quite a sad platter for price. Overall, we felt Hawker Bar didn't live up to its expectations of serving authentic food and found it extremely diluted and lacking in body and richness."}
{"text":"I suspect I will give this place a higher rating once I visit it again, but based on one visit, this tiny place has a strong hold on my eating decisions lately.

I love how the word \"quaint\" has been reinvented by marketing depts as a good thing. This place is smaller than quaint, it is TEENY. I love teeny (when it comes to restaurants), it means they focus on doing a small amount of things well, including the decor, I loved the wooden tables and stools and the space that they have is used well.

Now onto the food. I had the Rendang Ox Curry and I am telling you, I never wanted the plate to end. The coconut rice was perfectly cooked and the curry was full of heat. The right amount of heat. The chicken with fragrant rice was also a good dish, not mindblowing, but pretty delicious. The pork and chive dumplings were mindblowing; well stuffed little parcels of yummy rainbows. Now, I am not from Singapore, but it is my favourite city on this planet and I have had amazing hawker food while visiting. Hawker bar is close, but not quite as good as the real thing. But would I expect it to be? No. I expect the best Hawker food to stay in S'pore, that's why I travel there. I do think the service, teeny atmosphere and quality of the food make this restaurant a nice alternative on the Oss strip.

I do expect to return and try the laksa, I feel like only after the laksa can I truly judge this place. :)"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last weekend. The rack of ribs was AMAZINGLY GOOD! As was the Sea Bream. A little busy even with the second floor, and not cheap by any means, but goooood!"}
{"text":"This place is recommended by a client from Singapore and me myself from Malaysia. I heard that the chef is from Australia an never been to malaysia so won't be suprise if the food is not authentic. Ordered hainanese chicken rice was pretty impressive that has a pretty good flavor on the rice and hot sauce but the chicken was ok that I can say better than any other place in Toronto that I recommend to try. Laksa was not good at all and has nothing taste like laksa at all. Also, we ordered chicken wings as well that I would say ok only. ( ok = ma ma dei ) Will go try their grill fish cause last time they have no strigray in stock. Nice small cozy place but no reservation."}
{"text":"I came here purely to try the laksa. It was good, but nothing like the laksa I was expecting/had tried in other places. This one is very rich (I prefer a little less coconut cream) and it's yellow rather than red, but I appreciated all the veggies in it. Also be aware that the \"small\" is very small for $7. I also had the son-in-law eggs (yummy but expensive) and a ginger tea (ginger in hot water), which was nice. My boyfriend had the beef rendang, which was tender and well spiced. 

I like the decor--it was a good place to go on a snowy day. Staff were friendly and helpful. But I do agree with another poster that the chairs are not comfortable if you are sitting for a long time. All in all, a good experience. I'll likely be back."}
{"text":"In the past I have had great experiences at Hawker Bar. However, on my most recent visit, friends and I ordered the laksa. When the laksa was served to our table we found that the bowl was half filled. Upon tasting the laksa it was watery and not at all filling. At the end of our meal we decided to go to another restaurant because we were still hungry for a proper dinner. Maybe Hawker Bar was having an off night but this experience has not inspired me to return again."}
{"text":"We Stopped by here on a bar crawl for drinks and snacks. I guess we were lucky to get the last table. The first thing I noticed was that even though it was a mild night the bar was like an oven, waaay too hot. I managed to discover the fan tucked in next to our table and being the trouble maker I am, I pushed the buttons and  got it turned on. The Tiger beers were good and cold and not over priced. I ordered the dumplings which tasted really fresh and were just spicy enough. I wish the space was less crowded but I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Hawker Bar pays homage to Singapore style street 'hawker' food with it's own rustic and Western twist to it.  A team of super friends including the owners of one of my very favourite establishments, Poutini's, are behind this intimate resto located on the trendy Ossington strip and have opened my eyes and taste buds to the versatile sweet, sour and spicy flavours of Singapore cuisine.The appetizers we sampled are must haves at Hawker.The Chilli Salt tofu were little deep fried tofu cubes that were lightly dusted with chilli salt and refreshing lime were a good bite size in your mouth with a nice pop of flavour and crunch.  
Additionally the Singapore chicken wings are good enough for just a savoury snack or to wet your pallet for your meal.   They were salty but sweet and a hint of spice, wet enough but dry and not too too messy - my kind of wings.  We fought over the last one in our group of four. 

For mains, we sample a number of dishes on the menus which were made out of cardboard - a nice touch to the modesty of street culture. 
The first dish that came out was their version of the Hainanese Chicken rice.  I grew up on poached chicken so I was in love.  The only complaint is I adore dark meat and it was only served with white meat.  The chicken was served with 3 different sauces (chilli, soy and ginger) and the trick to this dish is to experiment and mix the sauces with the chicken to create different combinations of flavour.  My recommendation is to pair the chicken with ginger and a hint of the chilli!
We also sampled the 'singapore style' noodles - the flavours were unlike any Asian noodle dish that I have had, it was complex and heavy but light all the while being a delicious addition to our meal.  
We had to try Hawker's version of the popular Singapore dish - the Laksa Lemak which is a thick and rich coconut curry soup with yellow rice noodles, fresh snow peas, egg plant, red pepper and tofu puffs all mixed into it.  Our portion size was definitely large enough to share with the four of us and then some.  It was creamy and tart with good texture from the fresh ingredients and a surprise runny egg which was a nice bonus.

Finally we tried their sting ray.  I have never been a huge fan of sting ray but the server convinced me that it would taste as rich and tender as scallops and right he was!  It was really flaky and light however there was too much sting and not enough ray referring to the number of long bones in the sting ray so be very careful when eating.

Our bellies were quite full of Hawker style food but also cocktails as we drank our way through their creative drink menu as well but we were convinced again by our server to attempt dessert which were their banana fritters.  Came to our table bright green, served with red bean ice cream, were simply delectable and a perfect way to end our evening.

What a good introduction to the flavours of Singapore!   This is a great spot for a new type of Asian cuisine and would highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here with 3 really hot guys. Hard to tell after just one visit if the experience was so enjoyable because the guys were so hot, or if the food was so hot. Guess I'll just have to have dinner with an ugly person like my roommate to find out. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant, good ambience and service. 3 stars for the food. Got the tofu appetizer and veggie laksa. The fried tofu was good and got a nice spice kick to it. The veggie laksa, the flavour is there and it's a different twist but the noodle is 50% cooked. I know that people prefer al dente  but for rice noodles it needs to be cooked!!! The noodle was so raw that you can't really chew it. For a noodle bar uncooked noodle is a problem.."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! Overpriced and not authentic!!!

I was craving laksa and decided to try Hawker Bar out, their laksa is $16 for a TINY bowl (it's their \"large\" size), it's the size of a soup bowl. I shared this with my partner and had 2-3 bites before I finished my half. The soup was good but the noodles they used are not the noodles for laksa which makes me think this isn't an authentic Singaporean restaurant. We ordered the char kway teow ($17) which is also pretty small. it was VERY salty and had a strong soy sauce flavor? It was not good at all. I would not return to this overpriced restaurant with small portions and I would not recommend this restaurant. I left feeling hungry."}
{"text":"Went back last week and this place has seriously gone downhill since the last time I was here. The food made my girlfriend sick, my drink tasted more like water than the booze in it and my curry was thick and goopy. The fritter is still amazing however."}
{"text":"Came here tonight and ordered:
1) Son in law eggs - Delicious! I love eggs in general and it was a perfect one bite snack! It was hard to savour every flavour b/c it was just one bite but it was delicious! 

2) Chicken Wings - Pretty good wings! The flavours were very typically asian...a little sweet, salty and a tiny bit spicy.  

3) Ribs - The ribs were pretty good as well.  The meat wasn't fall off the bone but it was quite moist.  We thought the ribs were the same sauce as the chicken wings with some plum sauce added to make it to make it more sweet.  

4) Rendang Curry - This dish was our most disappointing dish.  It came with coconut rice which was delicious but the curry was so sour.  All I could taste was sour, to the point where I couldn't finish it.  

Overall, we spent about $50 and felt quite full.  We would come back but probably only for the son in law eggs."}
{"text":"This is a good place on the ossington strip. Don't take reservations so nice to walk in, but very small. Service is friendly. The wings were tasty and in the past I've had good dishes like stingray. Their curries are also typically good, though I wasn't impressed with the veggie rendang."}
{"text":"It was one of those experiences where many things were \"not wrong\", but not sure how \"right\" it was. I hate to give it 2 stars since the experience wasn't bad, but I don't think it would be worth another visit.

Dropped by spontaneously on a Saturday afternoon, offpeak hours so they were not busy at all. Their garage window was up in the front so the temperature was just perfect and the dim interior balanced well with the extreme brightness from the outside. Atmosphere, check.

Bartender/server promptly greeted us (check), and brought out handwritten menus on cardboards  - wait, record scratch, what? I get it was perhaps an attempt at \"hawker\" authenticity, but that was a huge turn off. Unclassy. At least make a nice trip for the cardboard edges, and finer, more legible print would have upped it a little bit.

She made us our cocktails: Fresh Material and Hawker Sling. FM was tasty but uneventful; the Sling was quite good. Maybe because we were there for a mid-day/late lunch, the $9 for the drinks seemed a little indulgent.

My partner ordered the Hainanese Chicken, which was not the real deal (trust, she's had a lot of HC's in her life). The chicken was pretty much cooked the \"Western\" way, which was dry and bland, and just thrown on top of rice. The sauce was not the tasty ginger sauce that accompanies it either. It was an in-house twist gone wrong. My Silken Tofu, on the other hand, was in fact quite delicious but I am not sure it would be worth the trip. The sauce was tasty, enjoyed the crispy flakes (was it taro chips? not sure!) and the mushrooms that partied along with the tofu but, call me picky, the tofu coming out in its original unaltered form complete with the ridges from the tofu container, was slight bit of a turn off as well. Like, thanks for flipping the tofu box over and warming it for me.

Glad to have tried it, but probably will not return. Will save my hawker feasts for the real deal in SE Asia.

Atmosphere - 4/5
Service - 5/5
Food - 2/5

{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The ginger tea was very tasty, and the food flavourful, but the meat was dry and overcooked. We had pork satay and chicken satay starters, the chicken and rice, and a chicken laksa. It didn't help that the ceiling vent was dripping water onto our tables (for which they apologized, but that was it), or that they didn't have a liquor license. 

I'll give them another go if Im ever in the area and they aren't busy, but I wont be making another special trip to eat there just yet."}
{"text":"The Ossington strip is always fun. Restaurants, bars, shops... you name it. Today we went for dinner and drinks.  We dished about life, celebrated tiny milestones, laughed and had a great time.

The Hawker Bar is small. A few tables and not much room around the bar. The decor was simple, lots of wood,  very inviting...I am not into fancy places... I have to say that I liked!

The music was not too loud. We could talk and no one could hear what we were talking. This is a quality that most of the Ossington and Parkdale restaurants don't have. Thumbs up!

The drinks were ok...I had the Evan's Revenge and the Hawker Punch. Both drinks were good but not out of the ordinary. I was up to some gingerbeer in my drink but it just wasn't spicy enough. Nothing compared to the drinks at Parts & Labour.

The Singapore Chicken Wings were definitely the highlight of the night. They were juicy, a bit on the sweet side and delicious.

The Randang Curry was not bad but not great, very average. The coconut rice was good though.

The broccoli was a ted spicy and tasty.

Would I come back there? Sure, why not, but just to have more of the wings, maybe grab a glass of wine, why not?"}
{"text":"Try the spicy coconut curry soup.  Surprisingly there are allot of vegetarian o options. . And even some vegan. 

No reservations so hope that there is room as the place is tiny."}
{"text":"I was cautiously excited to try this place and I am glad I didn't overhype it for myself. I know that they're not going for 'authentic' since it's a Singaporean street food restaurant on Ossington, but I have to say I was quite disappointed with most of the food we ordered. If you're a big fan of hainanese chicken, you probably don't want to order it here. The chicken was dry and didn't have much of the quintessential 'broth' taste you look for. The flavour of the rice was quite good but the rice was way too soggy. The sauces were ok - the ginger paste was disappointing though, and lacked the sharpness of what you would expect from the more traditional hainanese chicken sauce. Quite disappointing since I was craving hainanese chicken, but I guess it serves me right to order it from a place like this. 

do not order the dumplings. Severely overpriced and not good. 7.50 for 4 dumplings. Easily the most expensive dumplings I have ever had and just marginally better than the frozen kind you get from T and T. 

Laksa was decent but not good enough to match the hype this restaurant gets. Ribs were just ok. Nothing special about the seasoning or preparation. 

Brussel sprouts were delicious though, and decently priced to share at $5. 

Pretty sure I won't be going here again, there are loads of other amazing restaurants in the area, so unless you've tried them all already, you're not missing much by skipping this one."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant by recommendations. It is easy to miss as it has a small entrance.  The first impression when going through the doors is if it really serves Singaporean, Malaysian and Indonesian food, then it must be a fusion restaurant.  

As I have to drive, I order the Hawker Bar drink but no alcohol, it turns out to be a very refreshing drink.  I start to order my long waiting dishes the Son in Law eggs, the Whole Fried Sea Bream and a coconut rice.  I don't know why the restaurant call the eggs Son in Law but as explained by the waitress that it has to be consumed as a whole egg, otherwise, a bite into it will spill the egg yoke out.  I put it in my mouth and then bite it into halves.  Wow the feeling is that egg yoke starts to come out of the fried egg white and melts into my mouth.  It is very interesting experience.  The Whole Fried Sea Bream presentation is very good with the fried fish standing upright on the dish, accompany with banana blossom salad.  I like the sauce not that salty but good to go with the fried fish.  Although the fish is fried, you won't find it oily.  That's the catch that makes it so tasty.  By the end, the whole fish, I mean all, is gone with just the bones left.  The coconut is not too strong on the rice but enough to entice the tasting sense.

Ice Kacang is chosen as the dessert.  It is a shaved ice dessert which is topped with condensed milk, coconut syrup and red beans. 

Overall the restaurant is recommended given that you know what to order.  The server is very friendly.  She clearly explains each item before ordering and reminds us on how to eat the eggs!"}
{"text":"We were just randomly finding a restaurant in the area and walked in. They were only serving brunch menu at this time so I couldn't try their laksa. I had the Eggs Benedict with pulled pork, chilli jam and taro croquette. It was delicious with Malaysian flavours. The egg was perfectly poached with running yolk, pulled pork was tender, the taro croquette is different from the Chinese ones but it was good, like a taro patty. It was a nice fusion brunch, very flavourable. Loved it!"}
{"text":"First impression is that I've brought my friends to a street restaurant in Southeast Asia. Lots of fixtures that scream cheap food bar. 
The staff are friendly and are patient with the ordering time, no feeling of being rushed to put in first orders. 

The food is quite good. Balanced spicing and a great food texture, both the vegetarian and meat dishes were cooked very well. We got the chicken satay (skewers) for an appetizer, and a split of the rendang (ox cheek) and the Laksa curry(vegetarian and chicken)

Their drinks menu is diverse, I haven't tried any of their drinks yet though. Probably will be back to try their more interesting drinks."}
{"text":"I used to love Hawker Bar. Always a great place to go for dinner and drinks. So it was very disappointing to get a very average meal on our last visit. I ordered my staple - Singapore noodles (no chicken) they were undercooked, lacked flavour and came with 4-5 shrimps! For $16, that's pretty lame. Veggie laksa was too salty and bland. The regular laksa and some of the sides were pretty good. Sad to say, but it was probably my last visit. Or maybe, the chef had a bad night? Staff was pretty great!"}
{"text":"Great, Ive been back three times!  I lived in singapore for a short while and while this might not be super authentic its close and I still like it alot and the best ive had in toronto.  
Wings are fantastic and a must order as are the son in law eggs, also a fan of the chicken rice which is quite good.  The laksa is good but a bit on the heavy side.  Only issue this place is really small so plan on going early."}
{"text":"It was my 2nd time to visit. We got in around 5pm and selected the son-in-law eggs and silken tofu with the coconut rice side. A plain rice came out and was quickly replaced with the correct order at no charge. The meal was quite simple and ordinary. Tofu seemed like it came out of a package and not fresh. Would have liked to enjoy more flavour reminiscent of South East Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite spots on the Ossington strip.I like that this place it's a bit more intimate than the others and you can actually have a conversation.
I love their Hawker sling I could drink this all night if I had my way.
Their Singapore chicken wings are nice and spicy and the Chili Salt tofu is quite tasty."}
{"text":"** 3.5 stars **

Came here for dinner on Saturday night with friends.

I wasn't prepared for how TINY this place was! But the staff accommodated us by letting us sit at the bar until a table was freed up.

I actually kind of liked the fact the menus were hand-printed with marker on cardboard. (To each their own, right?)

The server was fine with our orders and any questions we had, and was quite attentive.

The dumplings I ordered as an appetizer barely stayed on the plate as they made their way in my mouth and down into my belly - tasty! I also sampled the Chili Salt Tofu one of my friends ordered, which was also very good (considering I'm not a big fan of tofu, this is a huge compliment).

For my main, I took on the Hainanese Chicken Rice. The server gave me a bit of an explainer on experimenting with the ginger and sauces. It was ... good, for all intents and purposes, it was just chicken and rice (even though it was a more traditional dish). In hindsight, I probably would have ordered something with more veggies on my plate.

Hawker bar was a decent introduction to Singapore street food. I'd like to see what else these guys can do."}
{"text":"pretty decent food, nice little vibe-great chicken wings
service started off well then kind of forgotten about-not such a big deal"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Nasi, but missed (removed from menu) the reason I first came to Hawker Bar - Hainanese Chicken & Rice (Singapore's adopted national dish?). Interesting cocktail menu - gin and cucumber pair great together, and the menu includes some great concoctions. Cucumber salad had also been revamped and was not as tasty as the previous version."}

Sometimes choosing a restaurant on the Ossington strip is like those problems you faced in the probability section of your math class in high school. What is the likelihood that it will be hipster? What is the chance that the food will be good? What is the probability that it will be hipster or have good food, but not both?

Hawker bar fits the last combination - it is definitely hipster, with it's tree stump-like bar stools and dim lighting, but the food is sub par. The only saving grace for me was the laksa. Other than that, the chili salt tofu and Singaporean noodles we got were average at best. 

I wouldn't say no if somebody suggested in the future, but it is not on my repeat list.

THE BOTTOM LINE: usual hipster Ossington joint with good laksa but sub-par other dishes."}
{"text":"Bartender took care of us on Saturday around 11, suggesting the cocktail he invented (the First Flight) because I stipulated that I enjoy grapefruit. However, they ran out of fresh grapefruit juice and subbed it in with orange juice. It was still nice (had gin, chartreuse, St. Germain) but I'd be interested in trying it with grapefruit juice next time. Also had the Hawkerita (limey and Tequila) and that's my favourite, hands down. Servers were pleasant and attentive. Vibe was romantic and great for a date. Will return to try the food. Beware of you're taller than 5'4\", you might hit your head on the ceiling when you enter the restrooms!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, not great.  We sampled many things and several were good, none were amazing, and the Hainanese chicken is awful."}
{"text":"Hawker Bar is another small, crowded, and trendy eatery on the Ossington Strip.  Offering up Singapore style street food, this place has been getting a lot of attention.

Even though the place was busy, the service was fantastic!  We were seated at the front window and poured steaming cups of spicy ginger tea.  If you are eating here, I hope you like ginger.  Everything has ginger and lots of it.

If you are curious what they are serving up, their website has some great photos of all the dishes!  

We ordered a bunch of items to share:

Son-In-Law eggs were one-bite freaking deliciousness  Soft-boiled eggs that are fried and served with chili jam ($6).  They had a kick and it was wonderful medley of textures in your mouth.

The Chili Salt Tofu ($6) was my second favourite item (after the SIL eggs).  Deep fried, a bit spicy, salty, easily sharable but you could probably eat the whole dish by yourself.

Laksa $9/$12 is a coconut-curry noodle soup.  We had ours with chicken, but they have a vegetarian and even a vegan option as well.  It was warm and filling, but I can't say it's the most exciting bowl of curry noodles I've ever had. 

The Hainanese chicken rice ($12) wasn't anything stand out.  The poached chicken breast was a bit too soft and I found this dish a bit plain.  And again, with the ginger puree... 

They don't have their liquor license, but I bet they'll have some knockout cocktails when they do!

Hawker Bar may not be the most authentic Singaporean food experience. 
But hey, you're on the Ossington Strip and it's a Singaporean restaurant owned by Australian dudes.  It's a fun place to hang out and snack on eggs with chilli jam."}

My Experience:

As part of my mission to dine at every restaurant Ossington has to offer, Hawker Bar has been high on my hit list. 

A Singapore-Fusion style restaurant, the initial reaction upon entering was the small size of the venue. Great for a date, but definitely hard to get a table for a group. Good thing we went on a weeknight, as weekends have been traditionally packed (trust me, I've tried).

We were greeted by friendly waitstaff, who explained in depth both the menu and the specials. The best part of Hawker Bar is their Vegetarian and Gluten Free Options, which are very clearly outlined and described in the menu.  

We went with Prawn Ginger Dumplings and Lamp Potstickers, which were delicious, but not entirely inspired, being of asian descent and often eating dumplings and potstickers. They tasted great (with about four per order), but didn't seem to be worth the value. 

The Son in Law Eggs (for which they are known for) was delicious. A great asian spin on deviled eggs, and the highlight of the meal. We also had the Chili Soy Chicken Wings, which was a bit on the small side, but packed great flavour. The Laksa was also delicious, with the noodle-broth combination being the real hero of the dish. 

Overall, delicious food, but it comes at a delicious price."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, cozy hipster place; stayed downstairs but there was like a club upstairs or something; food was good but not amazing. Tastes more westernized than authentic asian. Got the famous soy sauce wings but way too soy-saucy and to me, soy sauce is a cheat ingredient that a real asian would not consider as quality taste, except for western tastebuds maybe it tastes different and therefore savoury. I wouldnt get it again, i can douse my own wings in soy sauce at home. The baked egg thingy (forgot name) was good and diferent but a tad overpriced imo. Wouldnt go back, but worth a first time visit."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner a few weeks ago.  We had the Singapore chicken wings, cucumber salad, chili salt tofu, Hainanese chicken rice, son-in-law eggs, rendang curry with coconut rice.  Will be returning at least every other month.  Will be ordering the chili salt tofu, son-in-law eggs, Hainanese chicken rice and asking for a side of their cocnout rice.  My daughter loved the rice, but she didn't love the rendang curry.  I found it a bit salty.  The chicken rice is awesome.  Everytime I think about the chicken and rice and their accompanying sauces, I drool.  Their chili sauce is amazing.  If they sold this, I would buy a case and give it out to people I love."}
{"text":"Basing this review on one item really, the Son In Law Eggs, which are basically hard boiled, deep fried eggs.  Eggs have never been the type of food that would get me out to a restaurant but damn these would.  Also had some soft shell crab and a great cocktail...don't remember details cause eggs."}
{"text":"The food was ok....a little over priced.  The food is not authentic as I thought it would be.   The laksa didn't taste like laksa...they used pho noodles instead.  I been to Singapore so I know what laksa  should taste like."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful and we will be going back again. We had the son in law eggs and trifecta of skewers for apps. We started with the skewers, the chilli garlic shrimp sing to your taste buds, and memory as I am still thinking of them two days later. The oyster mushrooms were similarly revelatory, still need to pickup skewers for our grill. The chicken is more subtle and no less pleasing, my suggestion is a swig of a refreshing beverage prior to tasting the chicken. Next, we moved on to the son-in-law eggs, these will make anyone smile!

We ordered the hawker laksa and the Singapore noodles with sides of steamed rice and coconut rice for mains. The attention and care it takes to make rice this good is important not to take for granted, and there isn't much of anything to hide behind with the rice presented separately and attractively. The laksa, this what you want here, it is complex, balanced, and just the right level of rich in flavour, without being heavy. The laksa arrived with the steamed rice and went beautifully. After finishing the laksa we very quickly regretted ordering just one and resolved to remedy that based on how we felt after the Singapore noodles. The Singapore noodles are spicy, and arrived with the coconut rice. I like spicy and this pushed me mere centimetres out of my comfort zone in a good way. Like being in a storm without an umbrella, you must commit to getting wet. In this case spicy hot, and heat becomes enjoyable.

We then shared dessert, and my wife who doesn't like red bean anything enjoyed it enough to let slip that she regretted sharing it.

Thank you for a great dining experience, the service was impeccable, you're a beacon of deliciousness in Toronto.

We went back for a second time and  and had another awesome time. The chilli crab was so good we were discussing getting another at the end of the meal like our neighbours at the next table who asked for it to be hotter."}
{"text":"With a new second floor comes new food items and double the amount of seating.  

The char siu ribs is an absolutely must have - it's sweet, sticky and savoury all in one bite.  So good you might want to get your own even though this is a tapas style restaurant.  I get the Hawker laksa lemak every time because of its creamy curry seafood spicy richness.  It is a great dish to satisfy any eater since you can get it with seafood, meat, vegan or vegetarian. I recommend the shrimp broth with chicken.  Its also better than others in the city since it also comes with other toppings like tofu, eggs and veggies.  The Singapore noodles is another dish that I enjoy.  Since it is made with vermicelli noodle, it doesn't feel heavy in your stomach even after eating the entire plate, which is easy to do since it is so delicious. The brussel sprouts are cooked perfectly with an asian twist to them - nice touch. 

The cocktail or \"hawktail\" menu as they call it is interesting and goes well with the food.  The Hawker sling and first flight are delicious and light so be careful since you will want one after another after another.

This place is cute for date night or catching up with friends.  I like a place that has a warm atmosphere with nice decor that I can still dress casually to.  The second floor has a lot more seating so coming with a group is no longer an issue.  

The staff is super friendly and I like how they will check up on how you are doing but do not constantly disturb or disappear once the food arrives.  The best part is that they will split bills without a fuss.  Super accommodating group of people.

I miss the hainese chicken - please bring it back!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Went with a group of 6 (with reso) and we all loved our food, our drinks, the service, the atmosphere, everything! What a fantastic find. Can't wait to go back. 

Everyone loved their food. As for me I had the fried tofu, hoisin brussels sprouts and the coconut rice. Best rice I have ever had and everything was very flavourful. Extremely attentive service also. I did not find the prices expensive really.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Walked by Hawker Bar on a saturday night and decided to drop in for a snack before we danced the night away at Levack Block. It's a small space, and extremely hot inside. We got seated right away and our server was just incredible. We ordered the son-in-law eggs, chilli salt tofu and the chicken wings. They paced out the food great, and everything was incredible. The son-in-law eggs are soft boiled, then panko fried sitting on top of a chilli sauce. Perfectly cooked. The tofu has incredible texture and is perfectly seasoned. The real winner were the chicken wings. Sticky sweet with a hint of red chilli... just perfection.

I would definitely visit here again!"}
{"text":"We've lived in the neighborhood for a few years, and always meant to try Hawker Bar.  We went last weekend for a casual dinner, and were seriously disappointed.  The lamb potstickers were dry, lukewarm and gamey.  The two vegetable dishes that we ordered, the hoisin brussel sprouts (best thing we had, and that's not saying much) and the yellow soy broccoli (tasteless), were served on their own, and not with the meat we ordered.  The singapore noodles were dry, bound together and again, tasteless.  But the worst thing of all was the pork shoulder with mango (or was it papaya?).  When I order pork shoulder, I generally expect a slow cooked, pulled meat where the fat has melted away to reveal tender chunks of melt-in-your-mouth pork goodness.  What we got instead was a slice of pork shoulder, chunks of fat and all, seared to a crisp.  It was so blackened in fact that we couldn't really tell whether we were cutting up a piece of meat or fat until we popped it in our mouths.  Gross.  We left most of it on the plate, along with the boring noodles.  The waitress didn't even ask how we liked the food.  

We left, and the place was packed.  I just do not understand."}
{"text":"Hawker Bar just opened its second floor which means more room for gluttony. I went with a group of 5 (including myself) and while the place is small we were seated quickly and were not tight on space. 

Char Siu Ribs were to die for. We didn't end up finishing it so we got it packed. The next day my boyfriend at the left overs and screamed with excitement through his mouthful of pork in disbelief that there should be any leftovers of such a divine delicious dish (Triple D as we call it). 

I enjoyed the Laksa there while my Singaporean comrades were quick to point out that it was not authentic (likely chiming in from reviews we read from many netizens before hand) I absolutely loved it!!! The only down side was that I had ordered the shirmp but my  order got mixed up and got the chicken instead. I confirmed whether is was shrimp and was told yes until I bit into a chicken piece. Not to worry, I didn't mind. 

I also got the vegetarian renDANG curry which I devoured faster than I could say dang. Definitely my favorite and yes I ordered 2 mains. I mean why the hell not - it is tapa style right? I guess 2 mains wouldn't really mean tapa would it?

Okay lets talk tapas - I ordered the Brussels sprouts and before you ! with your face it was to die for. I mean, how can Brussels sprouts be this delicious; I just can't even imagine what wondrous goodies it is cooked in. We also got the cucumber salad which was finely sliced. The presentation made me not want to disturb how beautifully each layer of cucumber was stacked but alas I gave in and chowed down. Chilli Salt Tofu was also a favourite. I couldn't get over how simple these dishes were in theory yet the blast of flavour made me giddy with excitement.

The staff is wickedly friendly, the place is dim lit and there is a lot of chitter chatter between patrons which I loved. Great place for date night as its not too serious yet strangely has great potential for romance which one would not expect to find at a 'bar'. 

BRB as I make my way there now. This post made me miss the food!!!"}
{"text":"Note: This restaurant is not really serving \"family style\" food and sure, sharing is caring, but if you're hungry, then the food here is DEFINITELY NOT \"best when shared.\" 

I went to Hawker Bar with 2 of my friends on a Wednesday around 6pm. Hawker Bar is super comfortable, really cozy, and overall, has a really nice atmosphere. This place is tiny, tiny. I wonder how they sit anyone, really. There were three groups in that restaurant and all the tables were full. I guess you should really reserve a table on the weekend because I could image the place getting full really fast. 

I got the Pink Lemonade Fizz ($6) for myself, which tasted really fizzy and had a super pretty pink ombre color. The drink itself was super sweet, but the amount of ice they put in it diluted the sweetness down towards the end. I probably would not get this again just because this restaurant is quite $$$ and I usually only get drinks the first time around to get The Full Experience. 

We thought this restaurant was really family-style so we ordered: 
1. Chili Salt Tofu (Small) $8 
2. Hawker Lasa (Large) $18
3. Beef Hand Pulled Noodles (Large) $16

Chili Salt Tofu - I don't know why I agreed to order this. I don't really like salt over my cooked food, so I thought the taste was very strange. The chili salt had a very *weird* taste to it, and I didn't think it was that good. The combo almost didn't make sense. It was very HOT - temperature hot. Once you bit into it, you were kind of screwed because your tongue was on fire. I think our group agreed that the tofu was the \"worst\" food item we ordered. But maybe we're delusional, so check it out if you think this is something you'll like. 

Hawker Lasa - YUUMUMUMUMUMUM. This was probably my favorite from the three we ordered. I could easily eat this on my own for dinner. The seasoning was perfect, their spicy coconut curry broth was so GOOD. I love shrimp and the shrimp tasted REALLY delicious. I would come back to this restaurant and eat this over and over. The spiciness wasn't too bad at all. Just a little bit of heat. 

Beef Hand Pulled Noodles - I'm really bad at reading menus. I assumed that there would be broth in this (#taiwanesebeefnoodlesoup), but the noodles were dry. The noodles were very delicious, you could tell they were hand pulled. The mushrooms WERE SO GOOD. I think they cooked with some kind of wine, and it was so strong, but I LOVED IT. 

Overall, the sizes of the \"large\" platters are not that large. One could eat it on his or her own. The bar had a nice mood and atmosphere, and although the food is quite pricey, it tastes very delicious (besides the chili salt tofu). I could definitely see myself coming back with some friends and just having a chill time. 

TLDR; Small portions for \"family size\", kind of overpriced, but the mood is nice and at least the food tastes good. I'd come back again. But I'd eat my own \"large\" platter."}
{"text":"Arrrg another ossignton strip joint people rave about that I simply do not get. The food is fine but I don't understand the amount of rave accolades these places get. 
I tried a total of about 5 dishes and there were all fine but nothing was exceptionally amazing aside from the son in law eggs. Those eggs really were special. All the other dishes, (the chicken wings, fried tofu and the shrimp) were all fine but nothing that made me moan"}
{"text":"Singaporean style street food

Friend and I came here to get our food on after drinks at the Caledonian. It's an interesting place that I have been meaning to try for awhile. 

We had the hand pulled noodles with steak and the coconut curry shrimp thing. Both were delicious with the coconut curry dish being the standout and devoured within minutes. Also the pints were $5 after 9 pm. Awesome! 

Service was great too. They were accommodating as we arrived and had more people join us."}
{"text":"Food was amazingly flavourful and delicious, served hot, paced well.

Sat at the bar, damn, those seats are uncomfortable. The service was inattentive and sort of snobby.  Room seems very busy and full because the room is so small and the music so loud (this could be a pro or a con).  

Would go back, for the food.  But not for the ambiance or service."}
{"text":"The laksa here is pretty darn good.  The cocktails are really tasty and inventive.  It's tiny but in a very charming way.  I'm just happy to have some singaporean food in downtown Toronto.  MORE PLEASE!!!  Sup Tulang please!"}
{"text":"Adequate, but not great by any means, I went with a friend for an early dinner, tiny place, the service was very good, and they served us very quickly as well. Overall i found the ribs were somewhat bland, they were simply pre-prepared and tossed on the grill with a hoisin glaze, very uninspired and almost lazy. The wings were good, but again, nothing stunning here, just asian flavoured wings. Overall the portions were a bit small, as is the restaurant, so it's a VERY tight fit for anyone. portions were very small as well, closer to dim sum sizes. 

The food was just ok, i didn't honestly see the draw here, and i doubt i'd ever return, the food just wasn't good enough for me to consider it. If you're not familiar with south asian foods, then you may like this place, but if you're a fan of south asian food, this place will be disappointing im sure. ..."}
{"text":"Maybe this place is over hyped?

Got the Son-in-law eggs - it was like eating a raw egg pretty much. Wasn't that flavourful. Ordered the Hawker's Chili crab, it was okay but just not my style of food. I just didn't find the flavouring that unique. 

The setting is nice but space is limited and it's very tight, good if you want a cozy feel to it. Since it's small it might be hard to get seating. Good if you want to try something new and been to other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This place makes amazing laksa. If you like pho, but have never had laksa, try it! I was hooked on laksa while living in Australia and had a hard time finding good regular spots in Toronto. The owner/chef is apparently Australian himself and he has a great menu for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. I also enjoy the chili tofu appetizer."}
{"text":"Due to great acclaim I tried it last night. My companion and I shared a half rack of ribs a plate of Singapore style noodles and a soup.  All of this was salty. The biggest offenders were the ribs and the noodles.   Any lunch grade Chinatown restaurant will do a better job of these noodles. They were soaking wet. If I am not mistaken the texture of the ribs suggested they had been boiled.  Then a salty brown sauce smothered them. That pig died for no good reason.

I view this place as a lifestyle eatery, not a food
 destination."}
{"text":"Ugh. Hawker Bar was so disappointing. I left feeling ripped off and deceived.

It's called Hawker Bar. For the amount of time it took the food to arrive, if it was a actually a hawker place and not just a rip off of the food culture,  I would have left before the food came. 

The Singapore Noodles should not be called that. It didn't taste or look anything like Singapore Noodles. The flavouring was some strong tangy weirdness. The noodles were undercooked! I'm shocked that our waiter said it was one of the most popular dishes. At $16, it is astonishingly overpriced for a completely under executed dish. 

The chicken laksa was marginally better. The soup itself was spicy and a bit thin. There wasn't any depth to the flavour. I'm almost certain that the rice noodle is an inexpensive dry noodle. The chicken bits were dry and unappealing. 

There were 2 good things. The service in general was attentive. The chili soy chicken wings were decent. 

I would not come here again. The high prices combined with poor execution left a weird tangy taste in my mouth. After our disappointing visit,  I went on yelp to check what my fellow yelpers  thought and then realized maybe I should have checked the reviews first..."}
{"text":"Went with a small group and we all ordered cocktails. They are reasonably priced ($9) and easy sippers (e.g. Hawker punch). The snacks my friend ordered were tasty and interesting:

-son in law eggs *didn't get to sample, but my friend enjoyed them*

-chilli salt tofu *mmm... a unique salty bar food. Would definitely order again with a beer*

-singapore chicken wings *refused to eat more than one because I had just come from Foxley, but Fatty Natty liiiiikes*

This was just one of our stops during the night, but I enjoyed the time we spent in there. Too bad about being denied approval for a back patio, but they have a nice little vibe going on in there as it is."}
{"text":"Hawker Bar was never a traditional Singaporean/Malaysian restaurant but was more of an interpretation of that cuisine. They started of pretty well with that concept by offering a small menu but have gone downhill.
Introducing watercress to the Beef Rendang sauce is a total no no and it is now very sweet. Susur Lee and the rest of the dim sum chefs better watch out as Hawker Bar is now offering probably the most expensive Har Gow in the world at $9 for 4 small pieces that tastes very mediocre.
Something has gone really wrong with this place and they better get their act to together real fast."}
{"text":"If you're searching for authentic Singapore food, then I highly recommend you not to come here.
My boyfriend and I already knew beforehand that this was a 'fusion' restaurant, so with open minds we went in...

We ordered two Tiger beers ($6/bottle imported from Singapore), the Hainanese chicken ($13), and a Laksa noodle ($10 for a medium bowl).

The Hainanese chicken as expected was not the greatest. The chicken was indeed slightly dry, but after combining the ginger and the two sauces (chili sauce and sweet soy sauce) with the chicken, I didn't mind it that much. We ate all of it. 
Surprisingly, the rice was SUPER delicious! Might actually be the best rice I've had from a Hainanese chicken dish. 
(FYI - this is not plain ol'rice, the rice in this dish is usually infused with chicken broth, ginger, garlic, and chicken fat) 

The Laksa...well, it didn't taste anything close to an authentic Laksa, but more of a Thai Green-Curry crossover version. It was a tasty noodle dish though, but its not Laksa. 

 The service here was absolutely great. It really makes a drastic difference on your whole experience. The two waitresses were friendly, attentive, and fast.
 I would probably come back with some friends who don't have a clue about Singapore food, as it was a very enjoyable evening with good drinks, lovely service, and a 'fresh take' on Singapore cuisine."}
{"text":"Came for summerlicious lunch. They have seating spread between two floors. Washrooms are upstairs towards the back. Not particularly accessible. Servers are seen walking up and down stairs with trays of food.

Several options were not on their regular menu.
I ordered the Aromatic Pork and Beef Mince in Betel Leaf, Shrimp Laksa. and Banana Fritter, and had a taste of some other dishes.

The meat wraps had quite a gamey flavour, which was interesting. Those were enjoyable to eat.

The shrimp laksa felt more like eating a soup with noodles and a few pieces of grilled shrimp.
It was quite bland in flavour, though after thoroughly mixing the coriander, it was a bit better. The noodles didn't have any flavour, as if they came straight out of a pot of water and did not have time to absorb the soup. The shrimp was probably the most flavourful part of the dish. 

The banana fritter was pretty nice. Regular bananas fried in green-coloured batter, with ice cream on top. It was a pretty big dessert compared to the rest of the meal.

Overall, the portions were quite small.
Flavour was hit-or-miss. Hopefully the regular items are better than the licious menu."}
{"text":"This is a cosy little restaurant on Ossington that reminds me hipsters don't necessarily represent the horsemen of the apocalypse.  Service was fast and friendly and the food was pretty good as well!  The laksa (vegetarian!) was delicious, but as a warning, if you are used to China town portions, you should go with the large size - the medium just doesn't quite fill the tummy completely.  I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Hawker Bar - A quick review..

This place is not a Singapore/Malaysian restaurant, and those coming here in hopes of finding authentic hawker stall food (not to mention at authentic hawker stall prices) will be very disappointed.

The food is far from horrible. In fact, some of it is quite tasty. Here's what I had:

Appetizer: Crispy white shrimp with some kind of sweet and sour chili sauce
Appetizer: Asian style chicken wings - Hoisin glaze and Soya sauce dressing
Main: Singapore Laksa
Main: Rendang Beef, Coconut Rice...

The shrimps were done - Well fried, soft-shell shrimp, so no need to peel. The sauce was tangy and spicy. Chicken wings were also great. Crispy, and a good zest to the hoisin based sauce.

It went a bit down hill from here...

Singapore Laksa - It wasn't Singapore laksa. It wasn't even close to Singapore laksa. Someone told me that this was the best laksa in town. It might have been, if they bothered to serve laksa. See, the only resemblance to Singapore style laksa that Hawker Bar's version of Singapore Laksa has is the look. It looked like a bowl of noodles in soup, and it had the right toppings. The only way I could see this dish tasting the way it does is the following scenario:

Someone put a picture of Singapore Laksa in front of the cook. They don't tell him how to make it, what's in it or what it tastes like; only that it is called Singapore Laksa, but they ask him to replicate it using just the picture and the name of the dish. Not having been to Singapore before, he does a quick search on Google Maps, and discovers that it's in Southeast Asia. Sweet! What else is in Southeast Asia? Thaliand! He's eaten Thai food before...Close enough! What you get is an obtuse interpretation of what type of noodle soup you might get if you took all the countries in Southeast Asia and mixed them together.

The soup is full of lemongrass and is relentlessly and overpoweringly tangy. It resembles tom ka gai or a creamy tom yum more than that you would find coming out of Singapore or Malaysia.

The rendang beef was again, decent, but not exactly rendang beef. At all. The beef was cooked to perfection; the rendang part of the equation was unfortunately absent. There was some kind of sauce on there that consisted of, guest what? Lemongrass...Again... A ridiculous amount of it. On top of that, the coconut rice was cooked with sweetened coconut milk, which made the rice taste like rice pudding. I was initially really put off by it, but was eventually able eat more after I just tricked myself into thinking I was eating dessert. Beef dessert.

Anyhow, I'll concede that it may be my own expectations that have caused my negative reaction to the food here. It was somehow instilled upon me that a place called \"Hawker Bar\" would serve hawker stall style food at presumably hawker stall prices. Neither of these were the case. If they somehow changed their name to \"Generic Asian-y restaurant where everything we serve looks really good but tastes like thai food...whatever you order\", I would not have been so disappointed. I suppose that's a bit long winded though.

BTW, whomever told me that this place has the best laksa in town, please stand up. I will fight you."}
{"text":"This is my second time dining here, we ordered laksa lemak and chicken rice. The laksa was NOT authentic at all. It was sour and the ingredients were all wrong ( snow peas ??? Are you kidding me? Eggplant?) and don't even get me started on the noodles.... trust me, I'm a born and bred Singaporean and this is NOT laksa... I disapprove and am disappointed. I did not like the service, at least hire people who know the cuisine inside and out. ):"}
{"text":"This is not my first time going to Hawker Bar. I went there a year ago, the food it's ok, atmosphere and service are ok. So I took my date again few days ago and this time I'm very disappointed. The service and atmosphere are the same, just the food this time very disappointing. We ordered a shrimp laksa and hainanese chicken rice. Well first I picked this place cause is very close to bang bang bakery ice cream and second I ate here a year ago and consider not bad, so I go again . If you call yourself Hawker Bar (resemblance of hawker center in Singapore) please have the food close to it. The shrimp laksa is sub par( out of 10 I will give it like 3/10 I can  go to T&T, buy the instant laksa they carried and can still make it  taste better than this one). As for hainanese chicken rice (it was suppose to be a signature dish) they changed the way make the chicken, and the rice is soggy. The chicken look like a fried chicken roll; stuff with maybe some herbs (perhaps pedan leaves), it was horrible. I asked they did change the chef, the waitress told me they change the menu sometimes and the way of making it. I guess they're trying to make it fusion or something. Well, I won't be going back anymore."}
{"text":"This place is a little treasure - so cool, casual and hip. I really like the ambience and the setting. It was chill and it felt very intimate even though you're only a few feet away from the next customers.

We started off with the Son in law eggs. I heard a lot about this appetizer and wanted to try them. The server explained that we had to eat it in one bite, and when I took a bite, a burst of flavour exploded in my mouth. It was interesting and strangely delicious.
The sauce completed it and made it so tasty.

Then I had the chicken Laksa soup. It was a good size portion and the soup was very rich and flavourful.  It had the perfect amount of spice. Very comforting. 

I think it was a great experience to come here. Service was great, ambience cool and food were great. I wouldn't say authentic Singaporean/Malaysian food with a homey feel to it, but it's still a great place for food. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Hawker is an Asian restaurant located in the Ossington area.  They are known for their chili chicken wings which I have to say are delicious.  The prawn and ginger dumplings are also worth a try.  Since we were a large group, they seated us upstairs.  We made reservations in advance.  The decor is quite simple and they served us well given how many of us they had to keep track of.  The banana fritters were a great choice for dessert.  

The prices are pretty high for not so fancy venue but they do have some decent food options.  I don't think I'd visit again unless I happened to be in the area."}
{"text":"Hawker Bar is arguably one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The service is consistently friendly and attentive. Every dish has unique flavors to it and the menu showcases East Asia's culinary diversity. I highly recommend trying the following dishes: garlic chill shrimp, Singapore street noodles, and the duck curry. The duck is always tender and full of flavor. And the drinks are spot on - particularly the variety of beers that compliment East Asian food and Asian inspired cocktails such as the iconic Singapore Sling."}
{"text":"Laksar soup was too salty. The son inlaw eggs and wings were delicious. However I wish you guys had a small selection of Malay hot sauces, or grades of spice (hot,medium,etc.). When I asked for hot sauce with my food it never came."}
{"text":"Hawker Bar is aptly named, invoking images of street vendors advertising street foods by way of shouting in their food stands.  While they feature Singaporean street foods, you can eat your meal in relatively quiet and peace though I challenge anyone to come here on a \"quiet\" night as the newly famed restaurant always packs in a crowd.

With a gung-ho social media person manning the helms, with replies to tweets within seconds, I couldn't help but not put them on my radar of \"to-try\" restaurants - they only show up on my feed a dozen times a day! ;)

Singaporean cuisine is a melting pot which has influences that reflect its diverse population.  These influences include: the native Malay, Chinese, Indonesian, Indian, Eurasian, and even western influences (predominantly British and Portuguese).   Food is definitely a focal point to the Singaporean culture with some even hailing the act of eating as a national pastime and food, as a national obsession. [1]

To start we ordered the Cucumber Salad ($6) -  mandolined slices of refreshing cucumber dressed with a Mirin vinaigrette and crispy, fried sticky rice.  It was a light way to start the meal with very subtle flavours. 

Next came the famed Son-In-Law Eggs ($6), a fried soft-boiled egg that sits atop a bed of Prik Nam Pla (a Thai lime and chili condiment).  They should bottle this stuff and sell it!  After having this flavour-packed sauce, going back to the salad made it seem bland.

For our main we opted to share the Rendang Curry ($12).  They had me at braised ox cheek and coconut rice.  The actual curry itself has sour undertones and if you don't think it's spicy, just give it a few seconds before the hotness creeps up on you.  My favourite part of the dish was how the sweet coconut rice mellowed out some of the heat and tartness of the curry.  The ox cheek was tender and the water chestnuts added a nice crunch. 

The dessert list could use some development as there are only 2 options.  In the end we went for the Banana Fritter ($4).  This was the highlight of my meal as the banana is wrapped in a pandan leaf which adds some colour to an otherwise pale fritter, not to mention infusing it with flavour.  It has been said that pandan is to Asians, as vanilla is to westerners.  My dining companion dubbed it the Pan-DAMN leaf because it was so good.  And to top it off was a scoop of red bean ice cream and a healthy drizzling of syrup. 

V E R D I C T

Hawker Bar has definitely done a good job at highlighting a rather low-key cuisine (at least as far as the Toronto food scene goes).  While most would be quick to compare Singaporean cuisine to its neighbouring Thai cuisine, it really has unique characteristics of its own. 

The tarter Rendang curry was not my cup of tea, as I prefer a richer, more full-bodied curry - though I could've devoured bowlfuls of the sweet coconut rice.  As previously stated, the highlight of my meal was without a doubt the banana fritter.

The service was stellar, and all the staff were really knowledgeable about the menu and enthusiastic about where they work.  I hope to see an expanded menu as the restaurant gets its footing and some creative cocktails to be had.

{"text":"Hawker Bar was a bit of a disappointment. The food was not authentic and was not well prepared. We tried three dishes and none of the dishes were good. The betel lead rolls were very salty.  The noodles in the laksa were over cooked and soggy. The chicken wings were fine but nothing special. Not only were the dishes poorly executed, the prices were high for the small portions and poor quality. 

The service was attentive. The atmosphere of the bar was hip, but there are better places to go to than Hawker Bar."}
{"text":"Restaurant is a small venue located in Ossington area - the decor is quaint and cozy. I felt welcomed into a familiar environment, although greeted by unfamiliar faces. 

It was my first time here and seeing all the mediocre reviews I didn't have high expectations for the place. People commonly seem to compare traditional Chinese food to Hawker Bar...but I'm not sure that's a fair comparison considering this place serves Asian fusion dishes. Admittedly the laksa wasn't their best however the chicken wings definitely knocked my socks off! You'll also have to try the delicious coconut rice which tastes amazing even on it's own. Imagine the coconut sticky rice from the thai dessert mango + sticky rice, but with the rice on it's own. Yum! 

Although the place was a little far west, the food was yummy and service was great. I enjoy cozy and familiar environments as such, and felt like it was a great place to get together with a large group of friends."}
{"text":"Hawker Bar, you and me have a good thing going. If you're looking for twist on the standard pub fare, Hawker Bar is your place. HB serves up fresh, flavourful Malaysian food inside a warm, cozy-cool pub on Ossington. This is one of those pubs that you don't need to be drunk at to enjoy the food (i.e., the food is not nastoid and totes is yummy on its own). 

My personal fave is the vegan laksa. The broth is so delicious, with strong flavours of lemongrass, spice, and coconut tickling your throat with each bite. The puffed tofu is super yummy and I absolutely LOVE the healthy does of veggies in the laksa. SUPER yum. 

Also big ups on the brussel sprouts and the good beer selection. Service here could be better and more attentive but hey, it is a pub on Ossington afterall."}
{"text":"Recently opened to rave reviews, Hawker Bar presents a real alternative to fabulous and innovative cuisine that can be had on Ossington  and is a much welcome change from the local favourites.  

Admirable for their bravery to tackle the cuisine of quite possibly the most finicky of Asian cuisines, this place is hit and miss.  Ask any Singaporean or Malaysian for that matter about what constitutes the best of any of the local specialties and if there are more than 2 of them in your presence, prepare for lively discussion if not an all out war of words.  No one can cook x-y-z as well as so-so and that noodle dish is only good from Mr. C at the one particular stall on some side street in Penang that no one will ever have heard of. 
Singaporeans and Malaysians are absolutely maddeningly fanatical about food which earns them their rightful place as one of the most food obsessed countries in the world.

With that in mind, we arrive at Hawker Bar to a lively but tiny room, no doubt full from the glowing reviews in the weekend papers.  Service was swift but not always perfect.  (Growing pains or perhaps just not quite ready for the busy crowd).  You are seated in very close quarters with your neighbours so watch your elbows! 

We ordered a good selection of dishes to get a sampling of a variety of things - always a good strategy at Asian restaurants.  In descending order of yumminess, I list them here:

1) The fish special is super delicious!  Delicately fried and sitting up like its still swimming in the sea, this fish was done to perfection.  Flesh falls of the bone in delicate and moist chunks, accompanied by a spicy and savoury sauce adds just enough zing and sour/sweet notes.
2) Deep fried tofu - wonderful delicate pillows of deep fried joy again with a nice savoury spicy sauce for dipping
3) Son-in-law eggs - delicious as well.  soft runny yolks inside a lighly crispy exterior.   I was looking for toast points to sop up the goodness.
4) Cucumber salad was good but not terribly exciting

And then we come to the two dishes which were unfortunate disappointments.
5) Rendang misses out on all the spicy punch which makes this usual favourite.  Too sweet and bland from perhaps soaking in too much coconut water and not enough everything else, this rendang was mediocre at best.  The meat was tender so we didnt have to ask \"where the beef was\" but the proper question is \"where's the flavour\"?  The accompanying side of coconut rice was a sad mushy mess.  Not quite rice pudding but too mushy to be appealing.  
(I'm very fussy about rice so over cooked, under cooked or substandard rice is usually a deal breaker).

6) The curry laksa was also a disappointment.  The quality of the ingredients was high (with eggplant, nice crispy snow peas, tender chunks of chicken and tofu, etc.) but I'm afraid that this dish failed to get the essence of what makes a terrific laksa.  I would suggest Hawker Bar to take a drive out to Thornhill, Markham or Scarborough to discover what REAL laksa supposed to taste like, I'm afraid that was not it.

While this is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood, Hawker Bar can do much to improve upon the food.  With that, they stand to do well but for me, I'll be driving out to the far ends of the GTA to get my fix.

{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant out after reading many great reviews and hearing my Singaporean friend rave about hawker food. A few items we tried were disappointing: shrimp dumplings were $9 for 4 small pieces which were quite bland; chili salt tofu had nice crunch but unfortunately bland for something with \"chili\" and \"salt\" - didn't care much for sweet tasting BBQ dip that came with the tofu; laksa: according to my companion does not taste like real laksa, which I've never tried so cannot comment on its authenticity but personally thought it was good, though not memorable; sweet salty sour noodles is reminiscent of pad thai. Brussels sprouts were good value at $5 and nicely caramelized, but overall the flavors of food erred on the sweeter side of things and were really just average... The service though was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"Singapore Street Food. But at Toronto prices. 

I guess that sums it up in a nutshell. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but would be a solid 3 stars. Although the menu seemed to have a lot of dishes we wanted to try, there didn't seem to be enough unique dishes (being Asian) to really want to try. 

For example, I love Hainan Chicken Rice, except, the one served here seemed to be exactly the same as any other place. I didn't want to be disappointed (just in case) and wanted to try something new.

The pricing here is a little much. $9 for 3 small little dumplings. $9 for two Son in Law eggs (although really good, not sure worth $4.50 a piece). Yet the prices fit into the trend of the Ossington Strip. 

It was Saturday evening at 6:30pm and we grabbed one of the last two spots. The place is tiny but I love the tree trunk stools. There wasn't a line up the entire time we were here. 

We got the Son In Law Eggs ($9). a tasty soft boiled egg, deep fried and served with a chilli jelly. We were told to stick the whole thing in our mouths. 

For mains we got the Rendang Curry (ox cheek) - super tender fall off the bone meat in a curry sauce. Could have done with more rice. It's funny because being chinese, we both put the rice in our bowls and then ate it with the curry. Sorry, don't know any other way!

We also shared the Laksa. IOk, I apologize in advance for my ignorance, as I don't know what authentic Singaporean Laksa tastes like - I had it in Malaysia though. 
I can't say I really liked this one. I do like the creaminess of the soup based, but there was too much soup and not enough noodle. They also used a rice vermecelli which kind of sogs up and floats to the bottom (as opposed to a denser egg noodle to give it more substance). 
The Soup was spicy - I'd see if you can get it a bit milder - and was really lime tasting and a bit sour. 

For dessert, we got the Fried Banana. It was good, with a red bean ice cream, but nothing different than we've had before. 

Overall, great to try once, don't know if I'd return for seconds. Probably would rather try something new. But one this hipster central strip, I can see it doing well for a while, but I think they would need to change up the menu frequently to get return customers."}
{"text":"A new trendy restaurant opens its doors every week in Toronto. I read about them in the paper or hear about them from word of mouth from fellow food enthusiasts.

Hawker Bar was a nice experience. Dim and intimate, making it a great date destination. Certainly trendy with high bar stools and tables providing limited seating. Cozy and homey don't come to mind but that's not to say its cold or empty. From my experience, the service made my dining experience. In fact, added a star to my review. They were knowledgeable, passionate and understanding of good dining practices. They asked for our opinion of their dishes for future improvement. Timing was relatively quick and pacing between dishes set the bar for casual restaurants.

I had the son-in-law eggs which are deep fried soft boiled eggs that have layered condiments on top. I liked the flavour and sensation of the yolk bursting in my one bite but I wished they had a crispy coating and had been much cheaper ( 2 for $7, pricey). 

The laksa was creamy, sweet and sour. With a very noticeable tamarind flavour which was somewhat overpowering. Medium is a good portion for someone hungry and includes a son-in-law egg so you don't really have to order a separate appetizer.

The beef cheek rendang curry was my favorite minus the rendang... It was too sour and really took away from the incredible braised beef cheeks underneath. The coconut rice and cucumber salad are essential complements for the rendang.

Overall I was not impressed with what Hawker bar was or tried to be. Anyone from Asia could describe to you what a hawker bar is. Sorta like a food court with independently owned stalls all crowded around communal and public seating. It's noisy, cheap and delicious. This explained the concept behind the street style food here but that's only 50% of the fun. The other 50% was westernized and lost. It's relaxed and calm in here. The food isn't that cheap and there aren't stalls. It's a restaurant with a modern and rustic charm, but the food isn't exceptional. To me, it's a new experience that doesn't fit the bill."}
{"text":"Great spot! My gf and I went last night.

It was busy when we walked in so the waitress told us it would be about 20min wait for the table,  so we went down the road for a drink. I called later and she remembered us and told us to come back. 

Cocktails are great here- we both had 2 of the list! The hawker one was my favourite.
Service was really good- both the waitress and bartender did a good job as a team. 

Laksa was amazing- we had the chicken one. Delicious spicy coconut broth with perfectly cooked noodles.
Brussels sprouts in great sauce as well so we just asked for side of rice.

It is definetly affordable. Atmosphere is great!

We are back for sure!"}
{"text":"Why not hand write your menu on a piece of cardboard. Why not make your cocktails delicious and reasonably priced. And why not make the food interesting and lovable. The Hawker Bar is a really joint that you hope can keep its cool. 

Really enjoyed the cocktail, \"Evan's Revenge (get it with Woodford) and the Singaporean style wings. The Son in Law eggs are also worth a try."}
{"text":"Have been here several times with my boyfriend, as we love the place and live in the neighbourhood. 

As I'm sure you've heard, the chili wings are what it's all about. You must get an order to start. Dumplings are delish. Laksa is amazing. 

Great cocktails, friendly service, cool ambience. A fave spot on Ossington that is sure to be around for many more years to come.

An easy five stars."}
{"text":"Te silky crispy fried tofu is soooooo good. As are the chili chicken wings. The cucumber salad is OK but its too vinegary for me. We split some main courses which were also delicious: ox cheek curry with coconut rice and basic chicken rice with special sauce which sounds plain but is very very good. Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. They could do with some more original beers on tap (apart from the usual suspects: guiness, steamwhistle, okenagoen and the like) and the high chairs are very hard (left me with a sore bottom)! But overall, excellent food on the strip."}
{"text":"Summerlicious Satisfaction, but being generous with 4 stars...

Hawker Bar seems like one of the longer lasting cool restaurants on Ossington. The main floor dining room is small but pretty neatly decorated via the high top tables and tree stump stools. Although truth be told, I'm happy I got a regular table and chair as the stools, as cool as they look, do not look comfortable.
They also seem to have an upstairs dining room which I think mostly caters to large groups. 

Food wise, this meal was delivered with what I call \"high quality bookends\". AKA started and ended well, but the middle was meh.
I started with their Sweet Chili Soy Chicken Wings which had a nice taste and adequate meatiness. I'd definitely eat those chicken wings again if given the opportunity.
Second course I had the fried chicken and ribs, which were really nothing too impressive. The chickens batter was pretty weak especially, and only saved by the accompanying hot sauce.
I also tried a bit of the vegetarian curry and also have to say that it was nothing more than \"decent\" and if it weren't for the hot sauce that actually came from my fried chicken, it would have been entirely disappointing.
Luckily, the dessert, in this case a Banana Fritter with Vanilla Red Bean Ice Cream, was a fantastic end to the meal. The presentation is definitely weird as they use a green food coloring based batter around the banana, but it was legit delicious.

All in all, this could have been 3 stars... But the chicken wings and banana fritter, in addition to my generally lowered expectations of Summerlicious, all make me say 4 stars at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Unique menu. Cool, creative decor. Singapore noodles were excellent. Pork satay disappointing."}
{"text":"So having been taken here to experience \"hawker\" food from someone recently back from Austrialia, there was a lot of build up. Bringing Singaporean street food to Toronto is a great idea, a beautiful mix of Asian/Indian influences that is mad popular across the Pacific. 

Overall, the scene is a bit bare and crowded. The tables could use some new layout as you're crammed in a bit for table space. A interesting but experimental cocktail list. The son-in-law eggs and laksa were highlights but the chicken wasn't up to par. 

A few extra points for uniqueness but overall, it doesn't quite measure up to the real deal. Still waiting for someone to bring Hawker food to the masses."}
{"text":"I just had to write a review because I am confused as to why this place received such high ratings. I'd say this restaurant is OK if you were looking for below average Asain food... but this is as per an Asian person's standard. I honestly dont think this place would last if it were in Markham. 

The good: service & ambience

The not so good:

1. Spicy tofu - bland, not crispy enough
2. Pork belly - inconsistent seasoning, some pieces had peanut sauce which was good, but most doesn't, so bland
3. Taro totes - good, the only dish with adequate seasoning
4. Chicken Rice - rice was too mushy/wet, rice had no chicken flavor, sweet sauce doesn't belong, red sauce is good, chicken is OK. I've had this dish many times as a kid in Asia and this was a lame attempt at a classic dish. And yes, I've had this in Singapore, as well as Thailand and Hong Kong.
5. Chicken wings - This is supposed to be the best in town? Where is the spice? It's too sweet and kind of soggy. If you like good fried chicken (not wings, but Tawinese style fried chicken) go try the ones at Kanpai Snack Bar. 
6. Lamb pot stickers - this one was OK, but I like lamb a lot in general so I might be biased

When I think of Hawker food, it should be anything but bland, so I'm not sure if the chef there tried to tone it down for the Western palate or they just don't know what they are doing. Most likely the latter.

So overall, I would not recommend and would not go back again."}
{"text":"What?! I haven't reviewed Hawker Bar yet? I love Hawker Bar and all the people who work there.
The vibe is relaxed and friendly, the food is amazing. Recos: wings, son in law eggs (may sound weird, but the taste is fantastic), the light refreshing cucumber salad, and the Chili Crab special is a must eat.
The drinks are also really good - small but excellent selection of beer and wine, good cocktails and DEFINITELY get the frozen shots! I love the chili vodka - if you can take the heat, do!
Hawker Bar is open for lunch on the weekends so if it's busy at night, try again tomorrow. Do it."}
{"text":"This place really does injustice to Singaporean/Malaysian food, especially if you have actually been to Singapore or Malaysia. The food is not authentic and way too overpriced. 

The Hainanese Chicken was overcooked and tough. The ginger sauce is not made property and it should be combined with green onions. The authentic version should also comes with a bowl of chicken stock. Many of the menu items can be found in a typical Chinese restaurant at a much cheaper price and better quality. However, I do enjoy the drinks that they make. 

We only came to Hawker Bar since an acquaintance and so called 'food critic' recommended it. Won't ever waste my money here again."}
{"text":"Went to Hawker Bar for a girls night and it was amazing!! We did the $30 set menu and we were definitely not hungry after. Good pace in bringing out the dishes and lots of variety. I like that it was family style and people could take as much or as little as they wanted. I'm pretty sure we didn't leave one plate empty.  We also ordered pitchers of drinks for the table - highly recommend the sling. Delicious!! As for food make sure to get the wings. You'll be wanting to lick the sauce from the bowl.  The service was amazing. Our waiter was so accomodating and took really good care of us.  We sent a list of allergies beforehand and they made sure that there was enough food to accommodate restrictions.  I can't say enough about this place. If you're looking for a place to do a group event check this place out!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to eat: great food, great environment! 

The service here was excellent. Waiters were attentive to all of our dinning needs, definitely lead to us having a wonderful experience here. 

The food was excellent, would definitely recommend the chicken wings! Not your standard chicken wings, but it's a nice change from places like all stars, st. Louis, wild wings. 

The ambiance it's pretty chill as well, played great music."}
{"text":"So, being born in Singapore, I think I have some perspective on the food being served here. The thing with Singaporean food is that it is SO hard to recreate, I have yet to try solid stuff in Toronto, other than perhaps the occasional chicken rice or kway teow. There are Singaporeans and Malaysians here who open up restaurants also can't manage to recreate the dishes because the guys making this food over there have been doing it for decades and had their skills and tricks passed down to them. 

This being said, it was very hard to justify the prices when trying to appreciate the quality of the food. It's a tiny space, we got seated at the bar, the waiters were all very nice and were way too earnest in their attempts to 'elevate' the cuisine. 

Satay: Okay, grilled meat on stick w/ peanut sauce, not many ways this can go wrong.
Son-In-Law Eggs: two eggs, one squirted on me (they did tell me to eat the thing whole but alas my mouth isn't that big), flavour was okay but I wasn't really understanding the hype.
Chili Tofu: No flavour/ whatever flavours there were didn't meld well
Chili Soft-Shelled Crab Special: This was so bad. The sauce was exactly like a thai red curry sauce i.e. not Singaporean. Not spicy enough, one-note flavours, and the soft-shelled crab wasn't appetizing.
Ice Kachang: Only had ice and 2 colors (flavours) that tasted exactly the same; usually it comes with jelly, condensed milk, cane sugar syrup etc. 

Final Thoughts: So expensive, completely unjustified, and not authentic (in the least bit)...but A for effort!

Would I return? No."}
{"text":"The service here is really nice, they describe every dish, the sauces that go with the food, how best to eat it. I thought this really helped the meal.
I liked having the ginger tea, though I can understand having the ginger very subdued for the masses, I like it a bit stronger.
Generally the food here has a lot of different flavours in one dish which is very pleasant.
The son in law eggs soft boiled on inside and fried on outside is quite nice, with the lime-chili sauce goes quite nice. Though when you eat in in one shot as recommended, it's hard to really savour the food.
The chili salt tofu had a lot of salt. Wasn't too much to write home about.
The chicken laksa was very nice. The sour/spicy combination was very well complimented with it's good portion of chicken, a sonInLaw egg inside, some tofu and veggies.

I'd say the food here is well thought out with the flavours, when you rule out a few items on the menu you aren't left with much else.

They should have a secret menu."}
{"text":"I generally know what to expect from a restaurant on the trendy  \"Ossington strip\", but handwritten menus on discarded cardboard were a first. Just to clarify: every copy of the menu was handwritten, in marker, on pieces of used cardboard. Oh, it's a touch of street-food authenticity. I see.

The place is very small, but had no line on a Friday early evening.
Service was very efficient and the staff was very friendly.
The food, however, was underwhelming.
I had the chicken laksa, which is a coconut curry soup. What can I say, it was a heavily seasoned bowl of coconut curry soup, completely unremarkable in every way, except for the \"son-in-law\" soft boiled egg floating inside. I was so grateful for that egg, that one glimmer of hope.
My dinner partner, on the other hand, was unhappy about her egg surprise, since it was not listed on the menu as an item in the vegetarian soup. I suppose it can be a bit of a jolt to bite into  something you think is a large ball of deep-fried tofu, only to feel it oozing warm yolk. A son-in-law surprise indeed.

My soup also contained chicken meat of moderate quality, some tofu, a few veggies, and overcooked noodles. It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't delicious. Within an hour of leaving we both got strong stomach cramps."}
{"text":"After the bittersweet CMYE at Church, a few of us headed over to Hawker Bar to test out the waters. They don't yet have a liquor license, though the virginal replacements are very sweet and refreshing. They continually serve ginger tea in cutesy vintage mismatching cups.

We split a few dishes; S-I-L eggs, Chili Salt Tofu, Hainanese Chicken and Laksa. While I'd forego the Chicken, it was pretty flat-line; chicken with an assembly line of sauces of your picking, the S-I-L eggs are a must try as everyone else has pointed out. The deep fried, soft boiled eggs come in pairs of two on a bed of unbelievable tamarind-chili jam. They should jar that shit and sell it on the side. The tofu is deep fried and pretty decent, though the accompanying tamarind chutney was... Let's just say I'll write a love note to it later. It was perfectly fresh, tangy and pigmented.

The service was really fantastic. Our waiter was very enthusiastic and patient for a tiny yet busy restaurant."}
{"text":"The three stars are really just for the service. The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. Otherwise, the food was very disappointing and quite overpriced. $9 for 4 extremely small and bland dumplings. I've had phenomenal dumplings for WAY cheaper. I ordered the Singapore noodles and was disappointed as well. It was bland, and there were way more noodles than chicken or shrimp in it. I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Wow... I cannot believe it's been over 3 years since I visited Hawker Bar for the first time... probably even more surprised that this place hasn't shut down because there are much  better establishments that have closed their doors for good. Or maybe it's the Ossington strip and people get sucked into \"Fusion food\" because the prices are still lower than a few of the more upscale restaurants. When you think about it... the food is rather unauthentic and you still end up paying a premium, and your $17 plate of food is considered a good deal, regardless of how large or small your portion actually is.
... well enough about the speculations... let's get to this 1-star meal I had.

I'm better with Fusion food now... some places better than others, but nonetheless I still have certain standards.... I know others have said good things about Hawker so I was willing to give it another chance after my 3 star review, 3 years ago (I'm surprise I even gave it that!). Lucky for Hawker, they were opened later than Pho down the street and I was craving Asian-like food. The menu is no longer written on the backs of cardboard which loses some \"cool points\", but maybe it meant that they got their sh!t together (not really.. keep reading). Some of the menus items had changed, but the good ol' Haianese Chicken was still there. For those who do not know, Haianese Chicken is hard to master, and not easy to find in downtown Toronto, so when my dining partner tells me it's good here... then I'm down for trying.

We were hungry... and looking forward to this meal... so when a plate comes with little rolls that looked like deep fried chicken skewers (without the stick), we were confused.... very confused. **Just a note - if you look at the Yelp photos from 2013 - THAT is what Haianese chicken looks like*** Our plate was quite the opposite. The portion size was half the size of the chicken previously served. We actually deconstructed a piece of this chicken... thing. It was a piece of fried chicken skin, wrapped around really mushy chicken meat like it is ground chicken, with a piece of basil leaf stuck in the middle. It looked like cat food. no joke. The 3 sauces that use to accompany this dish was trimmed down to 1.. the standard hoisin sauce, and there was a little shredded asian-style salad on the plate. For $17, it was a complete rip off. When we talked to our server about this, she said that it's the way they do it and she didn't know what to say... probably because she didn't know what Haianese chicken was herself. She was awfully rude and didn't really care what we thought, to be honest. Before we left the restaurant, we overheard her in the kitchen telling the chef our comments.... if she wanted to talk about us, she could've waited until we left... but that made us voice our concerns one step further.

It is just misleading... advice to HAWKER: If you've change the way something is cooked, you should REname of the menu item... it's a let down to people who expect to eat a certain dish, but is served something completely off track... and no offense... Haianese chicken should never be made into a Fusion dish... it ruins the authenticity of the actual meat.

On a side note - the tofu might have been tasty, but for $7, I can tell you that each little piece of tofu you're eating is costing approx $1... just think about it and try making it yourself at home.

If I didn't say this already - don't expect Haianese Chicken from this place... you are getting deep fried cat food."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious. You must order the \"son in law\" egg to start. They recommend eating it all in one bite, and boy are they ever right. It was an explosion of awesomeness in my mouth. I could eat several of those suckers. I ordered the Laksa soup which was delicious, and just the right amount of spicy. My boyfriend ordered the Hainanese Chicken rice which was also awesome - a plate of rice and chicken served with 3 sauces that you can customize your meal with: ginger puree, dark soy and chili sauce. I had the banana fritter for dessert. I polished off every last bite and was tempted to lick the plate. Overall, a really fun and unique dining experience!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went back to try their laksa and rendang but they don't have rendang on the menu anymore. 

My friend ordered chicken laksa and I ordered shrimp laksa. Laksa was watered down, not as creamy as it should've been. 

We also ordered nasi goreng aka fried rice each. It was alright and dark, just like how a nasi goreng should be but again, too salty. 

Another friend of mine ordered some white food - pork something and it was good. So my advice? Stick to white food and not Asian. 

Had we not tried the pork, the rating would have been a 2. The laksa and fried rice were disappointing. So the pork dish has its redeeming quality."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for some food and drinks after work yesterday. I had somewhat high expectations for this place but it's quite mediocre. We had the oyster mushrooms satay which were good but came out cold. We then ordered laksa assuming it would have been a delicious thick flavor like the one in Singapore but couldn't compare. It was watered down, comes with noodles (not even rice noodles) and some broccoli. It lacked flavor. 

Great ambiance though. The restaurant is warm and cozy."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious lunch. Ordered the Shrimp laska. The soup and the shrimp was flavorful however the noodles were quite bland and felt like packet noodles. The portion was also quite all and I was still hungry. Service was attentive though."}
{"text":"Enjoyed some late-night snacks at this cool little bar featuring Asian-inspired yummies and creative cocktails. Since we arrived quite late (after 1am I think) only the first 5 items on the menu were available. The standout for us was the Crispy School Prawns...soft-shell prawns that you can eat whole, shell and all, served with a spicy tangy red sauce. I've never had a soft-shell shrimp before and I have to say, it was freaking delicious. Cocktails were also on point.

Cool spot!"}
{"text":"Good Asian food should punch you in the face with strong, fresh flavors. Hawker Bar was more like a love tap.

I came here with a few friends who had all been to South East Asia and we were really excited to see a place like this open up. We ordered a bunch of different things including the laksa, satay, eggs, prawns and a few of the specials.  I was especially disappointed by the laksa which had a very basic broth, the wings which were just sweet with no other flavor and the very bland satay with passable peanut sauce. 

They best thing about the evening was the service and the bottles of wine. Would come back for a drink but probably not to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious on a Sunday at 1 pm. Was about 90% full.  My first course was fried oyster and cured salmon on nacho chip.  Flavours were good but portion size was small.
For main dish I got the rice noodle dish with chicken and shrimp.  Flavours were good and portion sizes was fair.  Was too salty and had drink lots of water to quinch my thirst.
For dessert I got the pandan banana fritters and ice cream.  Portion size was good.  Presentation of the dish was nicely done.  Enjoyed the flavours only small complaint was the banana fritters weren't crispy enough. This was my favourite dish of the three.
Staff seemed stresses and over worked."}
{"text":"Came here for beers and appetizers with friends. The beer was cold and the chicken wings were sweet and delicious.

The service here is good, but wouldn't call it great. The only real drawback here is the uncomfortable seats!! You won't want to stick around very long!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for winterlicious. I must say that the food definitely brought me back to my trip to indonesia. I had wings and my wife had the curry for appetizer. Both were very tasty. Curry was not too strong and wings had a crisp to it. Then to the mains. Duck and pork belly was a home run. I envied my wife as she devoured it. I had the steak. The steak itself was ok. It was a little bit in the chewy side. The fried banana and red bean ice cream was amazing. The deep fried bun was great. Overall good atmosphere and food that rocks."}
{"text":"Yes, I am doing it, I am giving this place 5 stars.

Why? Because I want more.

We ate:
- Grilled sting ray (4/5): say what? This was unique and pretty yummy.
- Ox tail red curry with coconut rice (4/5): This curry...was luscious. I could eat this everyday.
- Friend banana (2/5): meh

Me likey!"}
{"text":"I have an ongoing love affair with chicken wings. And after hearing good things about the Hawker Bar chicken wings a few months ago, we decided to check it out.

Be warned - space is very limited, so either call ahead and ensure they have room, or come visit at off-peak hours. We came on a Sunday evening around 6:30 PM, and the place was packed. We ordered a pound of wings, the Singapore noodles, and the Son-In-Law eggs as a starter. Overall, the food was fine. Don't expect crispy wings - instead, expect nicely marinated, sauce-covered wings full of sweetness and spice. They were delicious. However, aside from the wings, in terms of the Son-In-Law eggs and the noodles, I'd pass next time - a bit too bland for my liking.

Decent food, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here again. For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $42.00. Note that street parking is available but limited."}
{"text":"There aren't many Malaysian restaurants in the GTA so I had to give this one a try. We had the chicken rice and laksa, two dishes I have had many many times. Not authentic, but definitely tasty. The laksa could have used less coconut cream and more noodles though. They used rice noodles (like the ones in pho) which was different but tasted okay. It was very busy and quite packed when we went but the waiter gave us free shots which made me happy!"}
{"text":"I went to this joint in an exceptionally good mood with Dinner Escort so they might have served us raw sewage and I would probably say I enjoyed it.

...but they didn't serve us raw sewage, they served us Pork and Shiitake dumplings followed by rich and spicy Laksa Lemak, curried veg with shrimp soup that had a really nice creep to the spice.  We also partook in the Hainanese Chicken Rice, as far as poached chicken goes, this was really well done.  Served with chili sauce, pureed ginger and dark soy, all of which we drizzled on top of the chicken, it was quite delicious and paired well with the yellow soy broc on the side.

I nursed a Okanagan Pale Ale and left full and exceedingly satisfied.

Note: tall stools are to be avoided if you can."}
{"text":"We'd been wanting to eat here for quite some time. Their vegetarian menu is quite enticing. We ordered the chili salt tofu as an app. It wasn't bad although more chili would have been nice. For mains we ordered the vegetarian laksa which was fantastic. By far the best item we tried. The nasi goreng was good but needed a bit more flavour. Overall pretty good night out."}
{"text":"This little bar restaurant is a nice place to grab a bite with a friend or in a group. 

My date and I came here and it wasn't overly packed like the other Ossington restaurants. The décor does appear to be hip and trendy but the vibe is very casual. 

The food has an Asian twist to it. We shared an appetizer of dumplings (three dumplings only which is an odd number to split if you're sharing with another person), and we each had the special entree of Singapore noodles. It was a healthy helping of noodles with plenty of meat, fish and veggies, and a nice kick of spice. 

The drinks were delicious: I had the Hawker Sling which I forget what the main alcohol ingredient was but it was sweet and spicy. They're definitely potent so one was enough otherwise I would have embarrassed myself greatly in front of my date and that's just not good."}
{"text":"I was there a couple of days ago with my boyfriend, who is of Irish descent. I was born in Singapore myself so was hoping to find some nice Singaporean food there. I grew up with food served in so called \"hawker centres' in Singapore so the name itself \"Hawker Bar' made me want to go check it out. 
The chicken wings which were at half price specials that night were great even though there isn't such a dish in Singapore. My boyfriend's Hainanese chicken rice (which is a popular dish in Singapore) was not bad at all, served with dark soy sauce and ginger sauce which always come with the dish. But my Laksa came with a few strands of noodles,to my disappointment.. The cost price of that bowl must have been just $1.50 tops ,and to be charged $13 for it felt like a rip off. The taste was not bad though but I feel the restaurant could fill up the bowl up a bit, so that it's almost the same portion as the Hainanese chicken rice. The 2 servers were nice and pleasant so that made our dinner experience enjoyable on the whole. Will come back for a Singapore noodle dish highly recommended by the guy seated next to us (he had brought his friend here for the  noodles that night and was disappointed that it was taken off the menu..lol)"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place because it was near my friends coffee shop (actually it is right next door). The menu has a lot of amazing items on it and their special menu is amazing too. I went the Thai red curry with duck. The duck was great and they had some parts that were really juicy and others that were tougher and crispy. The Thai red curry sauce was sweet and tasty, but wasn't spicy at all. I guess you can ask for some hot sauce if you want it. Overall it was a great meal and I would for sure have it again."}
{"text":"I tried their summerlicious lunch. The portions were so small and I didn't feel that I had eaten anything. If for a man, for sure he needs togo to McDonald to eat again."}
{"text":"Rendang Currie, a pint of Okanagan Pale Ale followed by the banana fritter for desert. One of the best combos on Ossington!"}
{"text":"Like I can't even.  The staff, the street. The food.  Dynamite.  We went with family and they treat you as such.  The price point was perfect. Especially for dining on ossington. The staff was very kind and knew their food well.  
The star item was their soup but I preferred the vegetable dishes.  
You can also come as a single and know that you will have a great spot to perch on one of the side tables or the bar!  

I will be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed an evening at Hawker Bar. Indo/asian small plates are very traditional, almost 'warung' style home cooking, but with a little added flair. It's nothing spectacular but very honest flavours...great if you are vegetarian, some lovely options there. The service was lovely, we found a bit of paper (?!!?) in one of the salads and they dealt with it admirably. The wine list is overpriced FYI. 

Get the ribs. The dumplings were also superb.

Chilled decor, pretty basic, but comfortable. Worth a look."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

Came here on a weeknight with some Yelpers and we were able to snag a table for 4 at the front. Hawker Bar serves simple Singaporean street food with great service and lovely presentation. We started with son-in-law eggs (2 per order, best eaten in one bite) which were smooth and flavourful, especially with the tamarind jam, as Roma M. mentioned! I really enjoyed the salt and chili tofu -- little crispy bites of deliciousness. Then again, it's hard to go wrong with anything deep fried. The laksa is pretty spicy! Drink the soup slowly, because the spiciness sort of hits you suddenly. Hainanese chicken was a-ok, nothing to write home about. The thinly sliced cucumber on the side adds a refreshing touch. 

We ordered some virgin cocktails (they don't have their liquor license yet), but our server forgot and they came at the end of our meal. They apologized and did not include them on the bill. Despite having no booze, they were actually really inventive and interesting. I will definitely be back to check HB out again once they have their liquor license. And our server informed us that they are planning to keep the kitchen open later (~2am) in the near future. This would be a perfect place to drop by when you've got the munchies after a night of dancing/bar-hopping!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times now with small groups and on dates and it's always intimate and tasty! Would definitely recommend the Laska soup and even though I don't eat chicken wings I've heard they are by far the best! Fried banana is the best way to finish ;)"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Hawker Bar for a long time and finally came here on a late Friday night. I loved the colored lights and cozy vibes of the place. Given we just came for a snack, we ordered the Laksa (small) and the Nasi Goreng Fried rice. I loved the Laksa and wish I ordered the large instead. The spicy coconut curry broth is amazing along with yellow noodles, chicken and shrimp. I wasn't a big fan of the rice but my boyfriend liked it as it had generous amounts of chinese sausage. For dessert, we got the friend banana with ice-cream which was the perfect end to the night. I thought the service was really good and overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Came for after-dinner drinks and were so overwhelmed by how amazing the food smelled that we came back!

Getting a table was a bit of a pain...took a lot longer than we were told and we still had to wait for a while after we had been summoned back.

Everything was delicious! Food and drinks were all excellent and prices were very reasonable. Turns out the laksa lemak was the intoxicating scent from our first visit and it didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Good: Beer is served really cold. The dark and stormy wasn't great - could barely taste the ginger beer kick as it was poured onto too much ice. 

Better: The chicken wings are really tasty (enough that we ordered them twice!). Unfortunately, everything we ordered was mediocre or bad. The cucumber salad is refreshing but lacks any real flavour. The son-in-law eggs were small, boring, and questionably priced at seven bucks for two eggs. Tofu bites are oversalted and underchilied.  

Best: Probably the fact that they're open and serving snacks until late (albeit a limited menu). Despite the small size, one can actually get a table here late on a Friday night. 

The tree trunk stools are pretty awesome too. 

Overall, not impressed. There are many better options on the Ossington strip. 

Dollars: $60 for drinks and snacks for three."}
{"text":"Fairly small place on Ossington, amongst a bevy of such small places that have popped up in that neighborhood over the last decade or so. Interesting Singaporean street food menu, not completely unfamiliar to Thai, Burmese, Malay flavors. Lots of coconut in the recipes, and definitely spicy depending on the dish. The Laksa soup appetizer was delicious with plenty of different tastes to entice your palate. The stingray was unusual and tasted great all mixed up with the rice, sauce and vegetables. We were first shown how to remove the meat from the skeleton and that was certainly fun. Beef cheeks were average at best, reminding me of better flavors tasted elsewhere or maybe I am just not a beef cheek fan as the meat was appropriately tender and presented in a cute tower format on top of coconut rice croquettes. Cocktails were pretty amazing as I had the Bobby Sour and my wife the Kaffir Coco, both great and indeed worthy of making Hawker Bar a stop on a pub crawl down Ossington Avenue. Overall a place I could return, just do not come here with a big group."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10 people after some problems with nearby Soos forced us to change venue. The place has a simple charm to it, mood lighting, a rather unusual mix of classic rnb/hiphop/dance music from the 90s/00s and a small main level storefront with a lot more seating on the second level. The staff was really friendly and attentive to our large group even though we took longer than expected with our 10 course meal.

 We settled on the fixed menu which included a lot of classic Singaporean staples with a few new twists like stingray, sweet coconut rice, pandan banana fritters, laksa and more.  The only issue was the small portion sizes for each course, we ended up going to another place after to make sure everyone else was satisfied. All in all an excellent experience for those who pay homage to Singaporean/Malay food."}
{"text":"I quite liked this place. It's true that it's not authentically Singapore, but it's pretty good. The place is another one of those tiny establishments with a long wait during busy time. It reminds me a lot of grand electric - doing cultural cuisine for north american taste buds. What you end up with is some good food, but it does deviate technically from the true dish. 

I tried almost everything on the menu and i think the best was definitely the laksak and the ox rendang. There was a depth to the flavors, with an interesting symphony and sweet, spicy and rich. 
The worst dish by far had to be the hainanese chicken. Tasteless and dry boiled chicken with rice and sauces. But the star of that dish was their shredded ginger puree, which i  would purchase from them. 

This place is good to go late at night when it's not so busy. They're open till 2am which is nice because it's hard to find good food at that time. The interior is cozy red with warm woods. It's something you'd expect on a beach somewhere which relaxed and friendly service.  Oh, and it's pretty reasonable on the pockets."}
{"text":"Bland. Good service, and perfectly good fried tofu (the one thing that came with a sauce with a taste), but otherwise a miss. I'd wanted to try Singaporean food ever since reading Kevin Kwan's novel \"Crazy Rich Asians.\" The descriptions made me so hungry! And I'm sure it *can* be that good, but this was just... edible, but without any real taste. The broccoli looked like it would be great, but somehow, despite seeing chili and garlic on it, the taste was just... mushy broccoli with a faint hint of garlic. It needed salt, or a sauce, or something. The fish special was just a bland piece of fish, with \"tempura\" mushrooms that tasted OK but that were incredibly mushy and didn't seem at all like tempura. There were also some sort of cooked onion pieces that were basically raw. 

All told, it's a pleasant, if pricey, night out in Toronto's Williamsburg. But if you live here, you're better off going to a supermarket on Spadina or Dundas, looking up some recipes, and trying this cuisine yourself."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place.  I'm originally from Malaysia and I miss the food soooo much!  Maybe I was going in with high expectation but...when I think Hawker Bar I think fast quick delicious home food.  We ordered: Satay, Laksa, Hainanese Chicken, and their stingray.  The  satay was WAY WAY WAY too salty!  Like hard to eat salty.  The Laksa was good, not like what I'm use to but for Toronto it was good...a little too heavy.  The chicken is something I could've EASILY made at home and it was quite dry.  The stingray I have to give you was AMAZING but the portion was way too small....

The BIGGEST issue with me was the time it took to get 4 dishes out.  I would say it took approx 1.5 hours to get everything out.  They put the satay out first, approx 30 mins after we ordered.  By this time me and my fam were STARVING so we finished the whole thing in 2-3 minutes then it took another 30-45 mins to get the rest of the food out.  I'm guessing it's more of a bar than for food....

I don't think i'd go back...or if i did it would be to drink with snacks not to eat dinner..."}
{"text":"So we went here for lunch... and the Laksa yellow curry with chicken  (we each got the medium size $10) was just about one of the best things I've ever tasted! It's a GIANT bowl with super-flavorful, and just spicy enough yellow coconut curry, chicken, tofu, a hard-boiled egg, water chesnuts, bamboo, eggplant and lots of noodles. 

I have a fairly good appetite and had to take more than half of it home (same with my friend). So we were pleasantly surprised. They flavors are wonderful and just the right amount of spice.

We were pretty much the only customers inside, but the space is a bit tight. There are wooden tree stumps to sit on, while creative, might be a pain for people with back issues.  We didn't try a cocktail, but they were a bit pricey.

Anyway, this place also has the SAME lunch and dinner menus. (main dishes besides the laksa curry are $14+!) Since they're open for lunch, it would be great to see a separate lunch menu, since the food is good. Considering most of the specialty restaurants in the area have separate (i.e. cheaper!) lunch options, it would be best if Hawker can offer the same."}
{"text":"Visited Hawker Bar last week.

It is a tiny place but cozy. I was solo so sat at the bar. 

I got 3 dishes - the son in law eggs, the chicken laksa and fried bananas.

The son in law eggs were my fave. I have been craving them ever since. I will definitely go back just for those.

I also like the chicken laksa. There were ton of veggies and the coconut milk stock was yummy. 

I really liked the fried bananas.

I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Yet another mediocre 'asian' food joint with food that is pretty basic, mini portions and way overpriced. 

Nothing we ate stood out to me and although there were some tasty sounding dishes in the menu, all of them failed to impress. Everything was basic, small, and I guess they call it asian cus they put some soy sauce and chili into the dishes?

Better off eating in scarborough or markham - way better food, way bigger portions, and way smaller price tags.

Not worth the hype. Don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"Sweet, sour, salty noodles - The resemblance with pad thai was uncanny. However, the flavour profile was different. I can't say that I'm a fan of this this. Too sour for me. 

Laksa lemak - This was by far my favourite. A rich and spicy coconut curry soup, noodles, tofu, red pepper, eggplant, chicken, and soft boiled egg. This dish had layers and layers of flavour. 

Singapore sweet chilli soy chicken wings - One of the best chicken wings I've tried. Coated in a really thick and sticky sweet chili soy sauce that was amazing. 

Prawn and ginger dumplings - Standard dumplings."}
{"text":"had a very good meal here. lots of interesting small dishes and interesting cocktails. very small restaurant so make reservations."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago late night for drinks and wings. It had a nice relaxed vibe. I'm a major wing snob and almost never order them in restaurants (home deep fryer only!). These wings were pretty good. Crispy enough with a nice kick from the bird's eye chili on top. Although I could have gone for more chilies and crispier, they were good enough that I would order them again. I had some sort of mixed drink with cucumber. It was tasty but a little long. Overall I would come again."}
{"text":"So it's not authentic. Who cares? The food is pretty good. Shouldn't that be what matters? I came in with low expectations and left happy after eating some wings, fried tofu, chicken rice,  and dumplings. Wings are a standout. Dumplings were only okay.

Four stars to counter the unnecessary negativity here."}
{"text":"This is a cool spot. Feels low key and casual. I guess this starts with the, hard to notice, sign outside.

Inside is all good aside from the wooden stools which can be a little uncomfortable (for me at least) if you get a table with them.

Food is great though. Wings are delicious. Singapore noodles, cucumber salad and rendand curry fu*$ing rocks.

Food is also pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Son-in-law eggs started our meal, banana fritters and Ice Kacang finished it and everything in between was incredible. Great flavours, particularly the Laksa soup and the Rendang Curry (ox cheek!). Place is small and intimate with great decor. This is going to be very popular, great addition to the TO food scene."}
{"text":"Important update! Son in law eggs are back at Hawker Bar! These have long been an obsession of mine so I was heartbroken when they were taken off the menu at the beginning of the summer. But they're back! 

For the uninitiated, these are small soft boiled eggs, deep fried, then paired with chili jam, prik nam pla (a type of chili fish sauce), and topped Thai basil and cilantro* springs. 

For those who have already experienced these little gems, there is one slight variation. The eggs are now presented sliced in half for easier consumption. So, you get four halves with your order instead of two full eggs. I kind of miss the explosion of yolk when you pop one in your mouth whole. But, one of my dining companions insists the new version allows you to appreciate the flavours of all the other elements in the dish.

For the record, the stellar service and sound track I've found at Hawker over the years remain the same.

*For those cilantro haters out there, of which I am one, don't worry. This sprig is easily removed if you want. I usually just take if off myself when it arrives at the table."}
{"text":"Maybe because I was jetlagged and it was late, Hawker Bar left me feeling a little bit disoriented.  The place is teeny tiny and it takes awhile for you to get a seat (particularly if you come at a peak time.)  When the food arrived.... it was okay at best.  I had the chilli tofu, and it was slightly bland.  The chicken wings were amazing though.  Yum.  Menu seems a bit confusingly laid out (charmingly on a piece of cardboard!)- again, maybe because I was jetlagged - the meat and vegetable and noodle dishes were scattered throughout so it took a long time to choose something to eat."}
{"text":"Note: I've been here twice, both times during off times where I was the only person in the restaurant.

Both time's I've been here I've ordered the Laksa. It's great, perfect spicy with a blend of so many veggies and meat. Food comes out quick and is piping hot. My only issue is that I get weird stomach rumbles when I eat this. The only other time I get this feeling is when I eat the special sauce from swiss chalet. I've had a few Laksa's in my time, this could be the best."}
{"text":"You know what's killing this place? The sign out front. The sign is killing it. It makes it sound like a trying-too-hard bar. It's a really good Asian fusion restaurant with some decent cocktails, why the heck does it have that \"next round's on you\" or whatever it says sign? 

Chicken wings, spicy tofu and noodles were all delicious... and shockingly hard to explain. Just trust. $40 for a good bottle of cava? Also excellent. Drinking the cava before eating? Never the best idea..."}
