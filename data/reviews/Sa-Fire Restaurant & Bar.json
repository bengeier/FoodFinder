{"text":"The design and decor of Sa-Fire is more like a Joey's or a Milestones but the food is unmistakably home cooked West Indian / Chinese. The owner's mom cooks most of the dishes and I'm told she's from Guyana. The Poulouri (fried cassava balls) were light and well flavoured and came with a homemade hot sauce. That sauce was okay for me heat wise but the sauce on the table was much hotter! I also had the chicken fried rice, which was very good, chicken wings and French fries. These are not regular fries; they are coated with a light spice and are crispy and not at all greasy. I had two martinis with the meal. I would highly recommend the Purple martini. Next time I'm going to try the chicken curry. It looked and smelled amazing!"}
{"text":"Unexpected pleasure finding this place for a West Indian style fried rice and chow mein. The server was amazing. Took great care of us, food came out fast and tasty. Try the sa-fire special rice , so much food also. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Good to know that this place is close to home. Amazing Caribbean food and the hot sauce does not disappoint. Ordered the pepper shrimp and jerk chicken fried rice and it was incredible. I've never had pepper shrimp the way they make it but it was delicious. Prices are also fair for the quantity of food you get. I HIGHLY recommend trying this place, will not let you down.  Will be getting this place to cater soon."}
{"text":"It's an interesting place, the sa fire mojito with the fresh kiwi tasted very refreshing. The jerk chicken was juicy and a good portion. 

The peppery shrimp presentation was good, each with its own individual toothpick. The spice was good and just enough spice, however the quality of the actual shrimp can improve."}
{"text":"The decor and spaceousness is nice. This is not your small little cramped rum shop.

The fried fish (Basha) was good at Saphire.. I tasted a hint of 
chaat masala ..nice touch"}
{"text":"This is my FAVOURITE place for a fun, laid-back party vibe with good music and good food. Make reservations. 

Food - amazing portions, prices, flavours. I've only tried the appetizers so far (calamari, garlic shrimp, jerk chicken, fries), and I highly recommend them. 

Drinks - great prices. I especially love the Sa-Fire House Mojito. Order it early as it can run out. 

Music - hip hop, rnb, reggae, chutney, soca, bollywood music. I've been on Friday and Saturday and both times the DJ's played the crowd well. Got a dance floor too - depends on how many reservations there are. 

Crowd - A little bit of an older crowd, unless you bring 10 of your younger friends. Everyone is laid back. I could even see my family loving this place."}
