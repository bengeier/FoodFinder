{"text":"Angie's Pizza is my favorite pizza. Seriously, it's some of the best pizza I've had in the Cleveland Area. I can't think of anywhere else that I've had better pizza. Their sauce has amazing flavor, and the cheese blend they use is spot on. Perfect! Always a generous amount of toppings too.  Their appetizers are good as well- the cheesy garlic bread is always a solid choice.  I've never had any of their pasta, but judging on their pizza, I'm sure it's great.  Five stars- would eat every day, if possible."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, great prices, and good pizza by the slice. Nice balance of sauce and cheese on a crust you can actually hold. In a world of \"artisan\" and specialty pizzas, Angie's is a welcome return to the traditional pizza I grew up on. And my 4-year-old daughter loves it.   I'll be back. Yuengling drafts for $2.50. Lunch for 2 with beers was less than $14. Seriously, can you beat that?"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? At one time it was the top 'o the heap......now it has regressed to average ...if that. Despite getting a burnt pie once while dining in and two soggy, wilted crust ones on two separate occasions I still gave them another chance. The only thing they have going for it is the sausage. The sharp potent cheese has been changed and is now bland. It seems they spray the sauce on, maybe a cost cutting measure?  Make sure to have a beverage on hand so you don't choke.  Wait....I hear music playing.......it's Springsteen's Glory Days.......something this place has lost."}
{"text":"What a shame. Angies pizza is delicious but 3x in a row they have messed up our delivery orders! 3x.!  But each time we call to tell them they messed up the delivery order they deny any mistake. Very bad attitude. One time we ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwhich. We recieved a dried up burnt  piece of something on a burnt bun. No sauce . No cheese.When I called they claimed \"That's how we make it° i told them not according to your menu. But they actually said we changed it!!!! CRAZY!!RUDE!!! Just say SORRY WE MADE a MISTAKE! It happens."}
{"text":"When it comes to pizza, for me this is the goto  place.  I have been getting pizza from Angies for at least 12 years, always have the crust a little more baked,  but lots of cheese.  Deluxe is a fav. I like the cheesy bread as well.  Good value, excellent pizza, what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"We recently moved back to the Cleveland area and are in need of a great pizza other than Angelo's in Lakewood.  We found it here.  Great pizza...will be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I tried Angie's pizza for the first time last week.  I thought the sauce was a little weak and the toppings were a bit sparse, but I really appreciated their use of fresh mushrooms rather than canned.  My husband frequently gets pizza from Little Caesars and he said he could definitely tell that Angie's uses higher quality ingredients.  I would go back, especially to dine-in since Angie's is the closest thing to a local bar on this end of town.  Make sure you check the circulars for coupons."}
{"text":"Went in one day around 3pm with my toddler and I can honestly say I got great service. I ordered plain pizza ( cheese and sauce) pizza bread and deluxe salad. The waiter treated my son so wonderfully.  All staff had smiles on their faces and were wonderful.  Great service great staff from people cooking the pizzas to the waiter. Thank you.  We will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Love Angie's! Always quality pizza and always friendly service! Cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"After reading many positive reviews, decided on getting pizza delivered to our hotel during a vacation.  Was told it would take 45 to 60 minutes.  After waiting an hour and 25 minutes, I called back to get an update.  Sounded like they put the phone on the counter as they \"went to check\" where the food was.  Waited 5 minutes this way until I saw the delivery car pull up outside.  Pizza was mostly cold and the box was soaked in grease.  No apology for being late.  Maybe the service is better at the restaurant, but I'd stay away from delivery."}
{"text":"Had it delivered to the Marriott Courtyard hotel on a recent trip to Independence Ohio. Pizza was very tasty. The delivery guy was super nice. I ordered a large pepperoni bacon and green pepper with extra sauce and the regular crust. The salad said it had pepperoni on it, although I didn't see any. The salad was good with a lot of cheese but overall was pretty average. The pizza was definitely above average I would recommend it. It's just a little different than the norm."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I actually worked here for quiet a few years and despite eating it probably more than once a week for nearly 6 years, I still thoroughly enjoy it.  I will say that at times you can get an under/over cooked pizza, but not that often.  They personally look at every pizza that goes out so unless it's an especially busy night (friday evening rush or a holiday) you'll probably be safe. I suggest any type of pizza (though i prefer plain), pasta (best sauce) or an Italian pocket."}
{"text":"A pizza shop that takes you back to the days of when pizza was pizza.  An old style parlor brings back memories of a simpler time.  Not to mention the pizza is made from fresh ingredients a a taste that you can't replicate anywhere.  Prices match the quality you receive and it is the friendly staff that treats you like family you can't put a price on.  The cheese may be the best in town.  Enjoy a with family or have a slice for lunch as you pass by.  An Independence treasure."}
{"text":"Just moved from Jersey, been on the hunt for a good pie. This is a good pie!"}
{"text":"Crispy crust, just the right amount of each ingredient, my favorite pie in the hood.  I take it out, even though I don't hate the inside, I don't love it either... and I could get there on my bike in a few minutes if I needed to, it's not much of a drive.  Food is a 5, everything else is so-so.  My favorite part about the place (other than the great pie) is the fact that their pizza boxes say, 'cleveland bake off winners 1989'.  Seriously?  Go win another contest guys, or at least stop bragging about something that happened before current high school seniors were born."}
{"text":"This place has been in toen forwver, hell my dad probably ate here in highschool. Their white Pizza is definitely the best in town, if youre into that sort of thing.  And I've recently learned they do a scrabble night.  I can't wait to grease up some Q without U words with melted mozzarella."}
{"text":"The g-bread is pretty damn good, the marinara sauce likewise. I'm just mad they forgot the jalapeños. The ticket even had it on there. They said delivery would be 1 hour...1.5. Not a great start with me. It's a decent pie."}
{"text":"Was visiting town for a few days and staying at a hotel down the road. Dropped by to pick a pizza up to bring back to my room. It was amazing!  They do not skimp on the cheese or toppings. Also a more reasonable price as compared to some of the other pizza places nearby operating out of trendy restaurants.  I live in West Palm Beach Florida and the pizzas later are terrible. Very few choices except large chains which all taste like cardboard.  I wish Angie's pizza it was in West Palm Beach because I would definitely be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"Ordered from here from my hotel and it was good enough for a quick and easy delivery. They ask that you meet them in the lobby of the hotel. Although for a small 2 topping pizza (the large slices of pepperoni tastes good but creates a lot of grease) and their bosco sticks (4) (they tasted kinda plain and okay but would order something else next time) it came to $16 including delivery charge before the tip."}
{"text":"Angie's ranks in the top two pizzas I've ever eaten. Love it. My mom has it waiting for me every time I come home from Texas."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence between 2 and 3 stars, but it's better than average so I'll give them 3.  I grew up on this pizza.  After moving away from the area years ago - I stopped in the other day to recapture a memory from my younger days.  The strong points - excellent sausage and decent flavored crust...much like I remember.  The weaknesses - sauce that seems to have much less flavor than in years gone by, and cheese that is definitely different - less salty/buttery than I remember.  Unfortunately, that's 2/3s of the overall flavor, so it really came up flat IMHO.  Still, it's a good bit better than the chains.  For years, I always thought Antonio's pizza came closest to replicating the 'good old days' of the Angie's, Pizza King, and Mama Mia's pizza shops of the Broadview/Rt 21/Pleasant Valley corridor.  Sadly, it's still the only shop in the area that has that signature flavor."}
{"text":"Just visited Angie's for the first time. Went with my parents and my dad is always looking for a deal and good food. We all enjoyed our meal! Food was delicious, prices were excellent, service was friendly & prompt. We will visit again on our next trip to the area!"}
{"text":"I love Angie's...always have...love the sauce and Pizza and love going there and eating....but recently I ordered to go and the young sweet gal took money from several patrons and then made pizzas, all without gloves or washing her hands....it kind of turned me off to be honest...especially after seeing some of the people she handled money from .   Lack of good sanitation practices makes me rethink ordering pizza from here."}
{"text":"Chicago boy stops by while on vacation and really enjoys Angies thin crust pizza.  Came here based on prior yelp reviews, and pleasantly surprised.  Although the outside of the building does not look inviting, nor the inside either, the actual food was great.  We ordered a thin crust sausage and onion pizza, and it was sensational.  Why?  Well, it's a basic tenant of cooking - it is because they use FRESH ingrediants.  THey do NOT toss po precooked sausage onto the pizza.  They take sausage obtained that day at a local butcher, and let it cook on the pizza.  If you are local, please support your local restauranteurs that use fresh ingredients - like angies.  If you a visitor and want a good pizza, stop on by too!"}
{"text":"They have the best white pizza around and nothing has changed, the food, the people or the decor in over twenty years! That's a good thing, a must have Friday night dinner pizza place!"}
{"text":"Haven't even had pizza yet. Been waiting for 40 minutes since we ordered and just got salad."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza!  My husband and I stopped in while out riding.  Small place, but friendly staff and neat atmosphere.  Really enjoyed the old school music.  Our large, custom pizza with sausage, bacon, black olives and mushrooms was delicious!  The crust was crisp and just the right thickness.  The sausage was not greasy and the bacon did not have white globs of fat.  The mushrooms were fresh too.  The sauce was a perfect blend of tomatoes and spices.  My husband actually did not get heartburn, which he does from most pizza because of too much grease.  I used to live 15 minutes from New York City and across the street from a pizza shop.  Angie's Pizza topped any of the \"pie\" I had there.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The Best Pizza In the Area! and great friendly Staff. I order from there its 10 mins from my house they say 25 mins usually ready in 15 mins... give umm a call or stop by well worth it!...Kevin"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza spots around that area in my opinion.  I try to stop in there when I'm passing through, and always get a consistently good meal. The people are friendly and seem to enjoy working there. They even have a lunch special of two slices of pizza and a soda for five bucks.  I've been stuck on getting a pizza with bacon, pepperoni, and green peppers the last few times in there, it is a great combination for sure.  Keep up the good work Angie's!!"}
{"text":"Angie's does some things really well. Their salads are surprisingly good and the people usually seem nice. The pizza is good, too, but beware...if you order a lot of toppings, it's hit or miss on whether they'll burn the crust.   More than once an otherwise good pizza has been ruined because the bottom is black. I'm talking burnt toast black. Inedible. You can call them back if you want but they give you grief about it. They'll send out another one in an hour or so...just don't touch the one you have or they won't give you a new one. So, you sit there for an hour looking at the burnt pizza (it looks really good because the burnt part is on the bottom) or you give up, curse them out on the phone and pick at the cheese and toppings promising yourself you'll go to Romito's next time.  This has happened to me more than once. I know, I'm an idiot, but they ought to get it right and I shouldn't have to inspect the bottom of my pizza while the delivery guy is standing there and the dogs are barking and going crazy.  Oh, by the way, if the crust isn't burnt the pizza is darn good."}
{"text":"My husband and I get pizza from Angie's frequently. They have never disappointed us. The worst part is on a Fri or Sat night, they get so busy you have to wait for that melt-in-your-mouth goodness that is melted cheese and flavor packed meats on a chewy but not hard crust. I have found this pizza to be a perfect comfort pizza, great anytime."}
{"text":"Angie's has really gone down hill.  They are cutting too many corners.  I think they turned down the temperature of the oven.  It is soggy crust pizza now."}
{"text":"My friends and I came to Angies for dinner when I was in town. It is a cute location, and was decorated for the holidays at the time. They have a fireplace and a decent amount of seating, but it is a small place. I also like that they have a place to hang up coats.  We shared the Deluxe pizza between three of us, and we still had some leftover. I thought it was tasty! If you don't want pizza, they have sandwiches, salads, wings, soups, and pockets. The service was a little slow, but not horrible. They should have come around to refill water/drinks more.  Overall, nice place, good food!"}
{"text":"Angie's sells six dollar pitchers of Michelob or LaBatt's Blue and good pizza with a ton of cheese that is so hot it will burn your mouth.  If that sentence doesn't move you, if there isn't a place in your heart for what it promises, I don't know you. I can't know you. Cleveland is a place where happiness is found in places like this."}
