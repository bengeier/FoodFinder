{"text":"Fantastic, all you can eat for a price you can only dream of.
$ 10 for dinner with amazing chicken, lamb fish and vegetarian dishes, as well as chaats. The lamb is really juicy and tender. The nans fresh and delicious. Great fabulous tasting food at an even better price."}

{"text":"We go for lunch in Indian buffet at Dhaba express . $7.99 lunch buffet. We come around 12.30 noon but the food is not ready , we have to wait for good 15 to 20 minutes . You can think if you come at 11 am for lunch and you have to wait long time to get food ready.
Finally the food slowly coming to hot table. They have the butter chicken , fish pokora, fry potatoes , beef curry and some vegetable.  
For final cost 2 adult and 1 child come $27.09 including tax. It seem they charge same price for child."}
