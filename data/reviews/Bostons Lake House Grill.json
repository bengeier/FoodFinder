{"text":"Took the Apache trail loop on hwy 88 to 188.  Restarant did not show up as POI but we saw it was open and made a U-turn.  It was quite busy for lunch.  It is a small place with a patio.  Inside the walls were filled with Boston sports team memorabilia.  The owner is from Boston and named Bsoton.  The beers were cold and refreshing after driving through 22 miles of unpaved road after Tortilla Flats.  The reuben sandwich on marble wheat bread was delicious as was the Big Papi Burger."}
{"text":"I went here with my dad after four wheeling in the Pinto wash. I ordered the wings, and he got the clam basket. I tryed one of his fried clams, and fries. They were both very good. The wings I ordered were also very good.          The atmosphere is pretty chill, and there is always good music playing. I would recommend this place to someone looking for a relaxed place to go for lunch or dinner, and not spend to much."}
{"text":"I don't go here often enough! I love the burgers! And the Phili Cheese steak sandwich is great too! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it can take a little bit to get your food sometimes."}
{"text":"Just want to say the food was alright, nice enough people however my wallet fell out of my pocket and I live out of town about 3 hours away and I called them the same night and asked them to look for it, they called back and said they found it! I had about a $160 in my wallet and I told the women \"Kim I believe\" and she said \"oh yeah there is money in their\" she offered to mail it back to me here in Tucson and I got my wallet back minus a hundred dollars. I don't know if she took it, her coworker took it or some bar/grill scum took it so beware losing, misplacing your wallet or purse there as they will take a finders fee from you. I had just mourned my Uncles John by spreading his ashes in Lake Roosevelt and this was our family dinner afterwards. Thanks Bostons."}
{"text":"Boston's is a great place to catch a game and have a cold beer and some good food. Boston (the owner) is a no nonsense but pleasurable man who is usually sitting at the bar talking to his many regular patrons.  Karon, his wife is also very nice and most times either behind the bar or sitting with Boston.  Brian the cook is a great guy who is always in a good mood and is an excellent cook.  The atmosphere is casual and fun, many locals as well as lake people.  The prices are fair and did I say the beer is ice cold.  Over all I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went to Roosevelt Lake to spent the day at the lake. When we were about to drive back we were all starving. One of the locals recommended Boston's. The Place was small and there was only one person working when we arrived. I believe he was the owner and worked at the bar, prepared the food and brought it to the table. The fried zucchini were good, the fries were really good and the burger was amazing. I believe the burger I had was called Big Papi. It had fresh lettuce, red onion, barbecue sauce, some kind of sweet green chili sauce and an extremely tasty beef patty.  Go here if you are anywhere near Roosevelt lake and you want a real good burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Came here 3 days in a row and had a few things on the menu. But the chicken takes the bacon!"}
{"text":"CLEAN YOUR RESTROOMS!!!! At 1230 in the afternoon there's no reason to have the garbage can overflowing with used paper towels. Other than that..... GREAT FOOD!"}
