{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! I am originally from Los Angeles and the Indian restaurants I have been to there are not nearly as clean as this restaurant. I was impressed. I also got greeted when I walked in by a smiling fellow who later provided me with great service throughout. The staff is really nice and caters to your needs (spice control definitely!)

My favorite are the kabob wraps since I am a student. They are so convenient for me. I recommend eating them with the maroon/brown chutney because it makes everything better with its sweet and sour touch!"}
{"text":"Really friendly and attentive service. Went in for the lunch buffet which was totally worth it for $9. They made fresh nan bread for us and another table, nice touch. Good  chicken tikka masala, perfect rice, everything I tried was good-to-really good. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Bland food. Very late service. Gave one rating coz it wouldnt let me give a zero rating."}
{"text":"Talk about excellent food! I can never get enough of the chicken tikka! Buffet or Menu this restaurant has excellent food! The vegetarian food on buffet is second to none, even on the lunch buffet. The pricing is great too for such good food! I highly advise all to try Copper Kettle"}
{"text":"I ate at this place years ago when it was at its old location and would not have recommend it.  I loved the restaurant that was previously at this location, before Copper Kettle moved in (Indus Village), but sadly they closed down.  

Last year I ate at Copper Kettle and it was horrible.  But I have been here twice in the last month for their dinner buffet, and the food has been amazing each time.  They must have a new cook, because I am now a fan.  Could be a tad bit cheap though."}
{"text":"I really like this place! The food is reasonably priced and very tasty. Their take on palak paneer is one of the better ones I've had. The staff is very friendly and really go above and beyond to make sure you are happy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! I had the chicken tikka masala and couldn't believe the price and size, not to mention the taste!!!! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for quality, authentic Indian food.

However, we came back again to pick up our order and they doubled the bill from 31 to 63.  We had to kind of find a deal because they said they couldn't give us cash because they didn't have any...? So instead we have a gift card there for thirty dollars in which the cashier signed and wrote \"over paid them\".  I do not know if we will get the thirty dollars back because we have not been ever since they charged us way over.

The food is amazing but the fact they sneakily doubled our check is not."}
{"text":"They had the option of a buffet for people like me who didn't know what I wanted. Got a spoonful of everything on my plate. It was so delicious!"}
{"text":"we ordered chicken biryani and naan.Both of them were really bad.
chicken biryani tasted like tamarind rice and naan is very o;d.
worst food I have ever had.waste of money."}
{"text":"After my family finished watching a lovely holiday performance by Tetra string quartet, we meant to eat out at ph. After leaving the concert, it was too late for ph. So we went here instead. At first, we were a little hesitant about it, (it is kind of a dive.) 

QUANTITY
My father wanted the buffet, but the rest of my family ordered off of the menu. One of the workers told my dad that they were actually closing the buffet, so he would just have the cook make different foods from the buffet. Holy cow, he brought him enough food to feed my entire family! He gave him masala, naan, Tandoori... So much food! HUGE PORTIONS for very very cheap. When the rest of the food arrived, we were shocked. Never before had I seen such portions. Needless to say, those leftovers lasted us a good three meals. 

QUALITY
Delicious. Amazing! My tandoori was perfectly cooked, melted in my mouth. The naan is amazing, all fluffy and scrumptious. So good. I tried everyone else's meals, and everything was amazing. Sooo good. And shockingly cheap. I give an A+!

OVERALL 
The food is delicious, the amount is abundant and whoa whoa whoa so much (I could definitely have shared my meal with my sister.) One of two minuses I can think of is the overabundance of food that is given to you, just because it might be difficult to box and carry home. The other is that the food is not very health-oriented, but that isn't really too relevant. 

TIPS
1) If you are a light eater and don't want to carry home 3/4 of your meal, I would recommend splitting a dish. 
2) One order of naan could feed four people, at least for my family. So, base your orders around that

Definitely would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The best Chicken Tika Masala I have ever eaten!
Great friendly service.  Great selection on the buffet and very flavorful. 
The naan is fresh and delivered hot to your table."}
{"text":"There seems to be a problem with everything in this restaurant, including the people who serve.

We first ordered Alu tikki.. We were given 2 pieces in a plate.. but no fork or spoon or knief to eat.. not even individual plates.. we had to call the waiter for each piece of cutlery, again and again.

Then we ordered, Mix veg curry.. and when we got it, all it had was peas and carrot. I told the chef that there seems to have been a mistake in order. But he had the audacity to tell me that this is how mix veg curry is prepared in that hotel.. 

Forget the food, they dont even have the courtesy to treat people nicely. I never want to set foot into this place again!!"}
{"text":"The food was fair to medium; however, when we presented a purchased Copper Kettle discount coupon management rejected it on the grounds the restaurant had recently moved its location and the address on the coupon was no longer relevant, voiding the coupon's value. This is the first I have encountered a bait & switch restaurant scheme."}
{"text":"We had similar experience last time but we thought of giving another chance when a friend insisted. 
Buffet dishes were in Really bad condition, looked old even though it was Friday evening. 
They promised to give fresh nan, once came out and said 'naan jal Gaye, making again'. Second attempt naan were under cooked. 
Owners: Please get professional cook and staff if restaurant needs to continue. Staff was really friendly and seemed nice people but that's not enough for a dining place.

Take out food is always tasty though."}
{"text":"Been a fan of copper kettle on Phoenix for long time, over 8 years. Was very disappointed when they closed down couple years back. Looks like they reopened here in Tempe. Food was really tasty and good. However, they didn't have beef pays and Nihari at the lunch buffet. Very disappointed about that, which are my fav dishes at copper kettle. Other than that, food, service and prices are good. Next time, I'll call first to see if they have beef on buffet, before visit."}
{"text":"Was curious to check out the restaurant that took over the Barzini's spot on Apache. We were very happy with the change. We dined in the early evening, and the server was pleasant.  I had the aloo palak and my friend and palak paneer - the spice level was perfect and we were happy with the portions. The meal came with naan or rice, so the bill was much lower than other Indian restaurants that up-charge for each side dish. The garlic naan was excellent, and we look forward to trying other entrees as well as the buffet.

We will definitely visit again- the food was just as tasty as other local Indian/Pakistani restaurants, but much cheaper."}
{"text":"Highly recommended... Great service.. Reasonable price.. Buffet selection is perfect.. Will definitely coming back.."}
{"text":"This place is really good! The service is friendly and the food is delicious. I got the biryani lamb and it was excellent - big portions too. Make sure to get the chai at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"I am typically highly skeptical of restaurants in Phoenix-Tempe area but this place has really good food and the owner & servers are so refreshingly friendly. I had the lunch buffet and was very satisfied. Their samosas were very yummy and everything had good flavor with tolerable spiciness. And they have good vegetarian options. The owner even gave us free desert that was SO good."}

{"text":"Pathetic uncooked bland non salty food please avoid at all costs. I would really expect some better food at an Indian place"}
{"text":"We tried this place out of curiosity. In the evening they had buffet. Owner and chef both were good , helping with setting up high chair for baby. Food wise for vegeterian its good. Nice part they prepared veg briyani separately for us and gave it as part of buffet. Wow. Best part of food was naan. It was soft and crisp"}
{"text":"Had buffet - really disappointed. They don't have appetizers and call it a buffet and very far from authentic Indian food"}
{"text":"I order take put from here and the food is great.  The chicken tikka masala is delicious.  I love the Channa masala, samosa, and garlic naan are awesome.  It has been pretty slow when I pick up my food (which I don't understand since the food is excellent).  I had the okra balti today and it was a hit with my family.  Check the place out."}
{"text":"I have been looking for Pakistani food for 28 years.   I spent a few years in England where I fell in love with Pakistani food.   Upon returning to Arizona I was never able to find curry that even came close to comparing to what I had come to love in England.   Last Tuesday night my wife and I just happened to notice the Copper Kettle in Tempe as we were staying in the motel across the street.   We decided to give them a try.   Oh My Goodness were we ever pleased that we did!  The food was so amazing! I wish I lived closer to Tempe to go back often.   I unfortunately live 4 hours away.  I will definitely come eat here again the next chance I get."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of their location in Mesa.  I'm glad they're a lot closer to me now.

The food here is good and flavorful.  I have no complaints.  As long as they continue to serve at least one goat dish on the weekends, I'll be happy."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times and I definitely recommend it. The buffet is great and so is the service  I haven't ate here in a while and really need to go back!"}
{"text":"Really friendly and sweet staff which made my first visits very welcoming. Just finished having some delicious chicken tandoori. I will definitely go again  especially to try their desserts. They sounded delicious."}
{"text":"Any business that ran out of food should NOT be open and offer to take any costumer or their money when they don't have the food they are advertising in their menu! That said here is why I gave them one star considering the Copper Kettle's Mixed Grill itself was acceptable to eat.

I got there on a Sunday evening around 7:45pm. A young friendly gentlemen received me with a smile and things seemed pleasant! It took a while for him to get to my order considering there was 6 people at the place. Then he informed me that he didn't have anything I was ordering due to a busy day. So I settled with what they had and here is what I got.

The Nan \"bread made fresh at the restaurant \" and they claim is the best was UNCOOKED and doughty\" 

The Doodh Lassi \"a yogurt drink that can be sweet or salty\" I ordered the salty one was so SALTY it was undrinkable. It had so much salt you could float on it. \"NOW it may not be a drink most people in Tempe may find palatable but I grew up drinking it so I KNOW how much salt should be in it... it should NOT gag you like salt water!

NO chutney or any side condiment normally associated with Indian or Pakistani food present.... anything I asked they replayed \"sorry we ran out\" or we don't have it... is like going to a pizza place and asking for Parmesan or crushed peppers and to be told we don't carry any of them??? WHAT??? I am not sure what kind of clientele they get normally but it was insulting to me when they pretend what they had to offer is the experience I should have had... Like I never done this before.... I asked for hari chutney and he was trying to pass a watered down Raita with out cucumbers for it... ??? unbelievable... 

The only waiter there was trying hard (I want to give him credit) but so ill equipped I felt sorry for him... Shame on the owners for leaving the guy to fend for himself like however I wasn't' sorry for the $18 bill I payed for food they didn't have and the uncooked Nan that was their claim to be the best. 

I also asked to dilute my Doodh Lassi drink so it was drinkable. it took 20 minute with only 6 people in the place and almost at the end of my meal a mango pickle plate was offered to me. So to be clear it took the man 40 minute to find the pickle jar they didn't have!

at this moment 30 people walked into the place... I saw the waiters face go blank and I knew they would not be able to serve them properly they couldn't handle 7 at this time but nobody said a word to this big group that just walked in the place.... and they seated the group... I had to get up and go to the cash register to pay for my meal and I stood there a good 10 minutes while the waiter jumped table to table telling them what he had or not.... 

A disaster! just a disaster! I waisted one hour and 20 minute for food that wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I have had take out twice recently. The first time I placed my Oder, it was never put into the computer and the girl who took my Oder went home. They were friendly, apologetic and quick to prepare our food. It was tasty but not the best I've had. The paneer tikka masala was what  we ordered. 
The second time we ordered we got the palak paneer, lamb korma and the paneer tikka masala. This time around the food was mainly oil!!! The lamb korma looked like oil with lamb in it. I'm not exaggerating. The palak paneer was fairly tasteless and oily as we'll. the tikka masala was oily but tasty still. 

 After tonight I will not be returning. I doubt their food is always  this oily but I would rather not risk it happening again. The amount of oil was almost comical it was so much."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and service! The lamb tiki masala is amazing!!!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is genuinely priced but terrible and bland.
The paneer tikka masala was so sour that it was inedible. The veg biriyani was terrible that we had to leave it there after a spoon. The only thing that was better were naan and the fruit custard. The service was  so bad. The guy almost threw the fork n spoon to the table. I will never go back to this place. Nor I will never recommend it to anyone. Stay away from this place.

I really wish I could give 0 stars. :("}
{"text":"Better than most of other Pakistani restaurants. Sometimes they are weird with their servings burn the hell out of food pr serving is too less."}
{"text":"After watching check please, we were super excited to check this out.  Ordered the garlic naan, which smelled amazing.  The main courses were ok, I liked my vegetarian curry but the meat eaters in the group were disappointed with their meals.  Service was really slow (even though there was only one other table there)."}
{"text":"We eat \"Goop\" for lunch once a week. The lunch buffet is great. I love all the vegetarian dishes and usually stuff myself.
We are always greeted immediately when we walk in and our drink orders are brought to the table with fresh naan as soon as we get our plates filled and sit down.
The owner is very nice and we love eating here."}
{"text":"I have been to Copper Kettle multiple times and in the past and when i say past i am talking about couple of years ago when they weren't at there current location. 
So i was at copper kettle couple of weeks ago with my family for their buffet and long behold the food which was being served i can swear was from the night before. I mean come on people make some fresh food if you want people to come back and eat. I told me family this place was so good when i was doing my rotations that i have to go there again but was extremely disappointed. The only reason this place is getting 2 stars is because it was clean and the Naans were fresh and good :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in after my fiance brought home a certificate from restaurants.com. I was blown away!! The service was very fast the staff was super polite and attentive and the food was outstanding. I have to recommend the Tikka Masala and of course the fresh made garlic naan bread. We will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"The space is small and the service was a little off. No one greated me, however someone did come out of the kitchen once I walked in further. They never offered to seat me, so I asked if I should seat myself. They said yes, like it was obvi and I should have done it already.  So I sat myself and they let me know that the buffet was to my right as were the plates. They offer a full menu, so I was a little dissappointed they assumed the buffet. I tried the buffet and non of the food stood out. There are LOTS of great Indian restaurants nearby, so I couldn't give them more than 2 stars. The tikki masala was bland and the tandoori was dry. I did enjoy the fruit custard for dessert, it wasn't too sweet and I could tell it was fresh. The highlight was the naan bread, I would seriously buy it by itself if I could. It was fresh and tasty, best of all it came out very warm. I might head back to try an item from thier ala carte, menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight around 7:30 for the dinner buffet and to use my Restaurant.com voucher. There was no dinner buffet, and the waiter said the new owner did not accept these vouchers. As far as I know, Restaurant.com was not told this, so I did not know. No other customers in the restaurant. No way this place survives."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch time haunts. This is a small mom & pop place so it is quaint & personal. The owner & staff are always polite & helpful. They cater to my maximum spicy overload! I love, love, love this place! This is right on the light rail & easy to get to.

A lot of great vegetarian & gluten free choices! 

You have to try my personal favorite, the Paneer Tikka Masala! If you are a spicy addict like I am... DO NOT... I repeat DO NOT pass by the marinated spicy onions on their condiment bar. They are AMAZING!! Yummmm! Did mention they have a fantastic buffet too? ...the best eggplant, a must try! Yummy rice pudding.

Another awesome bit of info...they don't close down in the middle of the day like most Indian restaurants do. They are open whenever the craving strikes!"}
{"text":"Great staff and I love the buffet. It gave me a chance to try a little of everything. The bread is awesome and the owner made sure we were taken care of. I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"This was a restaurant.com visit, around 2pm on a weekday.
We were the only patrons, until 1 other person showed up for the buffet. We took one look at the buffet and thought it had seen better days. And there were only 2 vegetarian options so we ordered from the menu.
Pakistani food is different from Indian food, but not by much according to the menu options. I like to order things I've never had before, so honestly, I can't really remember it. But it did have spinach, eggplant, and potatoes in a spicy sauce. It was fine.
Also ordered a side of naan and it was the tastiest I've ever eaten.

All in all, a good meal. Price point is good for middle class budgets."}
{"text":"They have good home style Indo-Pak dishes, the rice and the tikka Marsala was very good."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! I gave it 3 stars because of the service. The last time i was here, everything was great but this time was not  what we expected. When we came in the young latina girl sat us and then said \"we have buffet available\" asked for our drink order then left, so we guessed we had no other choice then other than buffet. She was on her phone the entire time, she didn't come refresh our drinks until we asked, still on her phone and only came by our table to give us the check and rush us out. Please train your servers on customer service because i love the food here but really disliked the service this time."}
{"text":"Had an a-la-carte dinner here. Very good, fresh, spicy dishes. Dishes have an authentic Punjabi flavor. There is dinner buffet till 9pm, for $10. 
Decent service and comfortable ambiance. 
Probably the best budget Indian cuisine in Tempe. 
Best dish: Paneer Tikka Masala."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! Excellent portion sizes for sharing. The naan was delish as well as the tandoori and chicken tikka! It is our new favorite spot for Indian food."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I am not new to the Copper Kettle, a friend introduced me to this place about a year ago, had been going to the on Dobson and Guadalupe .

I told my son since it was just him and I (he has 3 sisters, so it's rare when it's just him and I) we should go out to dinner, and I asked him if he is willing to try something different. He was game, but also my son likes to try new things out, and will even eat dishes I will not.

So I took him to Copper Kettle, when we walked in, we liked what we saw, what a nice set up this new place is. We were the only on there, but to be honest we were in the parking lot before 5 haha.

So I ordered a basket of onion stuffed naan bread, if you haven't tried it, you should, its naan bread with sauté onions stuffed in the center of it! So dang delish!

My son ordered Lamb Karahi, which was lamb cooked with onions, tomatoes, yoghurt, ginger garlic paste, he loved it!  I didn't try it, like I said he will eat dishes that I am not brave enough to do, and Im not sure about lamb yet lol

I ordered my fav dish! Chicken Tikka Masala!! OMG tender tandoori grilled chicken that then simmers in this beautiful orange/red masala sauce that just sends your taste buds into this heavenly bliss!! Just can't get enough! I have left overs for lunch that Im already wanting LOL

Also ordered pea pulao, which is rice, brown onions, and peas with seasonings, I love it!  I am not a big rice eater, but I love this dish!! 

Have to say I am happy the Copper Kettle moved closer to my house, now I can fill up on food and walk it off when walking home LOL  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the Copper Kettle for a few years now, and now I am tickled pink to see once again they are right down the street from me. 

It was a Sunday night and I didn't feel like cooking and the boys and I were hungry, so I suggested Copper Kettle and they said yes!

We arrived around 8:30 on a Sunday night and the place was still opened, we were greeted right away and shown a table to sit at.

After checking out the menu I started us off with some hummus.  This was one of the best tasting hummus I have had in a while, fresh garlic, the twang of lemon, the creaminess off the chickpeas, so so good! 

I have been craving chicken tikka masala, so that's what I ordered and I was no disappointed, everything was perfect! Tender pieces of chicken simmered in a flavorful creamy masala sauce, oh so good! Also ordered some pea pulao, which is peas in basmati rice & house spices, I love that stuff, probably the only time I eat peas willing too. 

Also ordered some onion stuffed naan bread, you have to try it!! It's amazing! Grilled onions sandwiched in the center of fresh baked naan bread, so good! 

Other dishes ordered was the ginger chicken and tarka daal, which both dishes were just as good, and everything is sort of served family style so we all shared each other's dishes, and had plenty to take home for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Tandoori nan was excellent, Achari paneer was so out of the world :-) it tastes like old age authentic recipe- a MUST try, had high hopes from Sindhi biryani but it let me down, so overall OK"}
{"text":"Food was really good... And it stops at that. Service sucks! Especially at night.. There was one guy who I am presuming is the owner. He didn't seat us but just told us to find our own seats. He came and gave us menus and when we asked what he recommends he mumbled something and we had to turn our heads to look at him. Like literally turn our heads all around and he wouldn't look anybody in the eye. When he brought out the food he didn't tell us which dish is which and when we asked if he can name the platters again he mumbled and walked off. What kind of service is that??? We had to walk over to the other tables and get our own forks and napkins. He didn't come once to check up on us to see how the food is, if we need anything etc. The most unfriendly socially awkward owner/waiter I've ever seen. Also, portions are small. If the owner wants to keep his business around, he should be smart enough to take this review in consideration and improve on all of the above."}
{"text":"our new favorite place!  The waitress was SO helpful picking out foods we wanted to eat, and my 7-yr old even found something he liked.

I can't remember the names of the foods they got, but we asked her if the lamb was real, or some sort of steak-lamb or spam-lamb. She said it was real, but it seems and tastes more real in 2 particular dishes (one of which my hubby tried). Apparently the shish-kebob lamb is real but may taste pressed or look unreal or something, which must be common in various restaurants, because this is the first place he's found what seemed to be real lamb meat.

The chicken tikka tandoori was wonderful and a huge portion--all 3 of us ate from my plate. The naan at first tasted different, but when it cooled down, it was really really good (and huge).  

The samosas were medium-sized; I have not been able to find those very small ones that they sell in other countries; guess I won't find them here in America.

Even the soft drinks tasted well-blended (often a problem in restaurants).

They took our Entertainment coupon gladly.

 I didn't see any baby seats, and so we had to prop the car seat on a chair for our sleeping baby.

FYI we went during the week and saw no dinner buffet (maybe there was one? not sure) but she said it was PACKED on the weekends, so maybe it's only a buffet on the weekends."}
{"text":"Yum!!  Chicken boti kababs - out of this world delicious.  I've only ordered take-out, but both times the service was great.  When I picked up once,  I had so much food the person working opened the door for me.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Amazing customer service, super clean, relaxing music, delicious lunch buffet for less than $8 dollars."}
{"text":"Had the buffet and the food was not refilled at all. The rice was starting to get hard and the food wasn't very warm. The inside was fairly clean but it was pretty empty. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place as there are Indian restaurants way better than this one in Tempe like New Delhi Palace and The Dhaba"}
{"text":"OK. We went here about 5 pm. School (ASU) was not in session, so maybe things were slow but you're only as good as your last meal served. I really didn't feel anything was less than 3-4 hours old. While it was in a heated pan, things were dry and crusty. There were some annoying young men \"hanging out\" in the restaurant, not eating. The owner and other female were helpful, friendly, but I was really saddened by this because I wanted to like this place. They have a buffet, many labels missing and the food looked a lot alike. The flavors were okay, but if the food is old and you have no customers, shut it down and let people order off the menu and make it fresh. The dessert/salad area was also \"eh\". 

My advice, order off the menu unless you get there when this stuff is made."}
{"text":"Have catered from Copper Kettle for parties and their dishes are always good. Biryani, Nihari, Afghani Boti are consistently a safe bet if you do not have time to cook up a spread yourself.
Once we got a batch of bad biryani and as soon as we called then about it, they got new trays started for us. While sending out bad biryani is never a good idea, they redeemed themselves right away by fixing the problem. I still get food from them."}
{"text":"This place is OK. Let me first start of by saying I have only been there for lunch a few times and never dinner. The buffet had some good choices and variety but lacked spice in my opinion. The nann that was served is very weird and not like traditional nann at other establishments. It was very much like a pita, heavy and lacking the normal light fuffy'ness of nann that we all know and love. Service is pretty good"}
{"text":"Went there for the lunch buffet, and it was only so-so. Hadn't been there since they were at he old location, so I don't know how their regular menu is. Sure hope it is still as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Yumm!  The flavors are rich and the presentation beautiful!  Humble ownership.   And now weekend lunch buffet!  We tried places near by featured on a popular food network show and was not impressed.. But Copper Kettle is a great relaxing neighborhood spot!  Bringing my husband next time!"}
{"text":"This location opened up very recently (either this Tuesday or last Tuesday).  

They offer a dinner buffet for $11, soda is $1.50.  There are a good selection of meat dishes, vegetable dishes, and some desserts.  Naan is served freshly baked at your table.  

Although there is a wide selection of meat and vegetable dishes to choose from, not all of the dishes are labeled, so you are left with trying out \"brown colored curry with mystery meat\" or \"light cream colored mystery blob.\"  Despite the variety, the dishes themselves were a bit hit and miss.  I wasn't a big fan of the pakora curry (or \"light cream colored mystery blob\" to some), it was a bit too sour tasting.  The chicken tikka masala was decent, and dessert was pretty good (gulab jamun, rice pudding, fruit custard), not extremely sweet like some desserts at Indian restaurants can be.  The naan was decent, not the best I've had but it came in a large basket and there was plenty of it to go around.  

Generally, I like that they offer dinner buffet here, since most Indian restaurants offer lunch buffet only and just entrees for dinner.  I think India Oven in Mesa does a better job at their buffet in terms of quality of the dishes, but this restaurant will do if I'm in the area wanting a cartload of Indian food!"}
{"text":"So after watching a performer by Tetra (a local string quartet) we came by this gem.

It was late and our orders were freshly made and amazing.  The tika masala was great as was the tandoori chicken and two other dishes which were equally great. And did I mention the naan?  Yummy fluffy..

And portions?   We are not the smallest waters and we had enough leftovers for next nights dinner. 

All for a price that was so low I had to look twice - yes it's that good a bargain."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch buffet. Food selection was good, but the food was lukewarm. Specially ordered onion kulcha which was really good.
Much of the food was spicy but especially the spinach paneer!
Dessert selection was small (2 items)and not of good quality.
Interior was open with plenty of seating, but sparse on decorations.
Service was okay."}
{"text":"I had the buffet and my husband ordered curry off the menu. We were both very happy with our food. The buffet selection was vast and varied. The potato curry was to die for! Icing on the cake was a huge plate of fluffy, fresh naan brought to the table. 

The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because their chai tea was less than stellar. Overall a great meal!"}
{"text":"Was not very impressed with my experience here. Saturday night, came in for their weekend dinner buffet. Selection was okay and one could tell that some of the recipes were unique and traditional.. Just didn't get the impression that much care/attention was given to the quality or presentation of the buffet...

  Beef kabobs had some flavor but were a bit dry. Chicken tikka and chile chicken were tasty. Good cauliflower dish, beef meatballs were bland, and as many have said - the naan is more like a sauteed fluffy pita bread... No goat or lamb (bummer!)

  I got my fill, and may try it again sometime - but will continue looking for my go-to spot in Chandler/Gilbert."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim amongst so many Indian restaurant offerings. Tried the lunch buffet and was not disappointed. Granted, I'm a white girl, so my knowledge of good Indian food is probably not A level. But I enjoyed it.

Pros:

Very clean restaurant (didn't use bathroom or check out the kitchen, so no idea there)
Nice buffet selection - not a huge number of options, but what was there was flavorful and filling
Friendly service - granted it's kind of do-it-yourself, but they were very pleasant
Naan was good - and served nice and hot 
Dollar value was good - buffet and drink was about $10

Cons:

Wish they were in Central Phoenix where I would go to them more often

Compared to some of the other ethnic food options in Tempe, Copper Kettle is a good bet."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night using our Entertainment coupon (which listed old address, had to call for new, they gave a nice apology). There was a party going on behind screens, all Pakistanis, women & girls in traditional wear, balloons, lots of children that were literally running though the restaurant, squealing with delight. Very glad we were not expecting a romantic dinner... We approached it as cultural diversity, chose to enjoy the loud, festive atmosphere. OK... A little annoyed when one of the little girls did a few particularly high-pitched repeated squeals, & one kid bumped my chair as they chased each other across the restaurant...

It was less than an hour of closing, so we asked if the buffet was not such a good idea (been out a while, no fresh coming). The kid waiter went to ask, and we appreciate that he returned reporting that the menu would be a better choice to insure quality.

 Ordered lentil soup & sesame naan (new & listed on back pages). Lentil soup was soft yellow color, not darker lentils I'm used to. It was creamy with very small pieces of lentils. The flavor was more mild than I'm used to, but a subtle spicy. It was nice, no complaints. The sesame naan was fresh, crisp bottom, soft top layer, added a bit of salt and WOW delicious!! Lots of sesames on top, yum.

Then ordered chicken tikka masala, as I'm working my husband into such foods, and he for sure likes this dish. Nice white breast meat which he prefers, simmered in that divine red creamy sauce. I'd call it mild heat at best. I'd prefer a bit spicier, but perfect for my husband. 

We brought our beverage with us, after calling to make sure it was okay. Nothing is mentioned on the website one way or the other. They were very accommodating for this, brought us glasses, and offered an opener to use. I am under the impression there's a seating size limit to such places & not sure they don't exceed it, so I'm going to stay vague so they/we don't lose this option! It was GREAT - kept our bill nice and low.

If it wasn't for the Entertainment coupon, we wouldn't have known to try them... Now we will be back!

4 stars not five because it was really good but not mind-blowing... It would take a big wow to have me give 5. Children thing doesn't affect score, as I know that was a celebration exception, and again chose to see it as a cultural experience. Omar works part-time, very nice, friendly, good customer service. He apologized for the chaotic environment, which was nice. 

Saw grumpy uncle at counter, no smile, but we didn't have any interaction with him. We were waited on mainly by a nice kid with puffy black hair, seemed a bit timid but did fine with everything. Omar came to us and chatted at the end of the evening."}
{"text":"So I've been looking forward coming to this establishment for months and finally last night my inlaws were in town and wanted them to try Indian for the first time.

First of all I didn't realize that it was a buffet - my #1 faux pas for Indian cuisine.   Second the service though she was friendly was not good.   Only two tables occupied in the place and drinks took forever and I had to get up and ask for the check.  And finally the place itself felt off -random Egyptian art on the wall to name one but just didn't feel the warm and fuzzy walking in there.   Not sure if I'm going back."}
{"text":"Didn't really pay attention to the names of the dishes I was having as part of the buffet, but all was very tasty. Nothing was too spicy, and all very flavorful. The naan bread was terrific, and came out fresh."}
{"text":"First 5 stars I've given.  Food was incredible.  Had large platter with naan.  Service slow and casual but food was so good that it still deserves 5 stars.  Prices shockingly reasonable too."}
{"text":"The chicken tikka masala was awesome! :) This place was empty when we walked in- It felt a little awkward. The food was good but there was only one guy who was doing the waiting. He refilled our drinks, and then brought out our food. Thats it. The food was awesome though."}
{"text":"Food tastes good but the customer service is pathetic. Management should hire more staff. The place is not at all hygienic, the glasses weren't washed cleanly and were smelling. I wasn't impressed with the overall service."}
{"text":"Where do I begin.........the absolute WORST!!!!!!!! Pakistani/Indian food ever. I am from Pakistani and I am familiar with the taste and looks of every Dish, with that said I am not sure why and how this restaurant is still open for business. I did their weekend buffet and every dish I tried was awful and pathetically bad. Their chicken biryani served at the buffet tasted like it was reheated and served for at least 3-4 days, chicken tikka was tasteless and dry and did not had any tikka spices. Their daal (lentils) was at least a week old I can easily tell by my he taste and look of it, even their rice pudding was I am 100% sure at least 4-5 days old and had big ol lumps of rice. I wish Yelp including de negative starts because this place -10 stars. My advise to anybody who is even thinking of trying this place is STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE, they are serving reheated food that was first cooked at least 3-4 days ago, Curry Corner is still 10000% times better then this dump."}
{"text":"They should call it the Chicken 'Tendon' Masala. I ordered the Tikka Masala (medium) to go, 2 orders actually with the garlic naan. Got home to find it doesn't come with rice, could be my fault for not asking. Traditionally I've found that it does come with rice or the server asks if you'd like some which would indicate it's absence.  Anyway, I am diving in and find it dreadfully bland. Nothing a bunch of salt won't cure but still, also not a fan of all the crunchy tendons in it. I'll be eating the bread and using the sauce to dip."}
{"text":"The buffet was really good, with a lot of dishes.  Vegeterian and meat.  There's a sign at the door that indicates they have halal meat, for those interested.  My husband and I tried everything, to the point I thought I'd explode.  My 4-year old found things a little bit too spicy, so he enjoyed several servings of the rice pudding.  The service was fine, there were only 3-4 occupied tables.  And the place inside was very clean.  The only thing I didn't like, which unfortuntately I see a lot, are restarants that absolutely do not allow natural light in, by blocking all windows.  It makes me feel like I'm in some dirty dive bar or something.  Open your blinds!  Let the light in, specially when it's not summer and you are not facing west.  Anyway, just my preference.  My husband didn't even notice.  We'll be back."}
