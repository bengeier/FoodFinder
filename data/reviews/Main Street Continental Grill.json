{"text":"We have driven by this restaurant many times and finally decided to give it a try. The owner is extremely welcoming and attentive and the food was delicious. We will definitely be back and will bring friends and family to enjoy this new gem that we just discovered!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Kent hands down. Excellent food, friendly service, and a lot of options!!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but today I am compelled to do so. I was super excited to be able to get some Mediterranean food because I love fattoush salads. I placed an order for a fattoush salad no onion no tomato and I get it, there are onions and tomatoes. I called back they sent a new one which was half the size of the first one lol I guess I get punished for wanting my order to be correct. A few weeks later I to my hankering for a salad again, order it no onions and tomatoes, the lady repeats it to me, no problem right?!?! Wrong it's full of onions, ugh. Not that hard I feel like they are picking on me. So I call and tell them it's wrong I gt a new one with tomatoes, I can't win so I won't be coming back. I don't consider myself a picky eater I just hate onions and if they were easy o pick off I would but they aren't. Screw you guys"}
{"text":"One of the greatest places to eat in Kent! The food is always really fresh and the owner and his staff are really fun and friendly. The place is pretty small but it adds to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Please go elsewhere. It was probably the most disgusting food I have ever tasted.   We decided to give this place a try after seeing the delicious looking pics online. But damn, the food tastes nothing like it looks and was absolutely horrible. The rice was undercooked. The meat was almost too difficult to chew. Not to mention, everything was covered with some real odd tasting spices and it wasn't cheap either. Paid $40 something but neither my husband and I could finish our plates. In fact, my husband almost threw up after walking out from the restaurant & you know it's bad bc my husband eats everything. No food could ever stop him but continental grill, you did it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything I have ever ordered has been good, especially the hummus.  It's a pretty small place, but in the summer you can eat outside on their patio. The staff is friendly and helpful if you have any questions about the menu.  There are text deals that you can get from 'college mobile deals' (just google it, find Kent State in the search tab, find the deal you want, and enter your cell number free of charge). I just used the text deal with a friend that was for 2 Gyros, 2 orders of fries, and 2 drinks for only $10...it's like a sore dick...ya can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place today, while out looking for lunch.  Bright, friendly service, seating kinda cozy.  Food was outstanding!  My wife had the gyro sandwich, loved it.  I didn't realize that the gyro salad was a 'dinner' size salad, so i added the lava lentil soup.  Both were great, well spiced.    Fairly short drive from our house, will definitely be going back to browse thru the menu.  It's a keeper!"}
{"text":"Couldn't have any more praise for the place. I eat here at least 4 times a week. Great variety, cheap, everything's fairly healthy and balanced and I'm yet to have something I didn't like. Except for these pink things in the salad. Still have no idea what they are. Nonetheless, the staff is all chill and young and know their way around the kitchen."}
{"text":"The first time we ordered takeout from here, I was not impressed.  My dolmadas were cold and dry, everything seemed bland and boring.  It took months for us to give it another try, but when we finally did, it was a whole different experience.  This is now one of our favorites.  The salads are amazing, especially if you're eating in - a big pile of greens and finely chopped veggies, with chicken or beef, and an incredibly good homemade dressing.  Everything seems very fresh, well seasoned, well balanced.  We love sitting in their little patio area on warm days - it's not a great view, but it's cozy enough.  My husband has really liked the falafel plate and the kebab plate... My preschooler loves the spinach pies.  The food seems to suffer slightly with takeout (smaller portions, lack of presentation) but it's so reasonably priced that it's hard to mind - it still tastes good.  I haven't tried the dolmadas again, but I haven't needed to.  We're happy enough with everything else."}
{"text":"I love this place. I get the Chicken Mishwi salad almost every time. It is so fresh and the chicken is grilled perfectly. Every time!!! I love it. I got the gyro platter once which was also very, very good. The fries are good too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and selection.  I go back every chance I get.  The owner operator is a wonderful person.  Great value for the food."}
{"text":"Very good food, always fresh and hot. Very small inside and parking sucks, so I usually get take out and have never been unhappy with a meal. Staff seems nice too!"}
{"text":"So if you're searching for an hot dog that's to die for...try this place. It's sad to say that I haven't tried anything other than the hot dog but that's because it's so good. I get it with coney sauce, cheese and sauerkraut. After finishing it, I always want another.   The service is great. There's sometimes a bit of a wait but that vouches for how great the food is. I have tasted other stuff that my co-workers have ordered.  It is located on the front side of the university so lunch time is surely the busiest time. I tend to call my order in rather than wait.  Overall, I give it 4 thumbs up. Always my go to place when I want something different."}
{"text":"I ate at the Continental Grill today for the first time. It came well-reviewed. Here is my opinion:  Meal: Mediterranean Sampler (kibbie, meat pie, spinach pie, grapes leaves) Service: Prompt, friendly. Price: $ Authenticity: C-, cheap & Americanized, barely recognizable. Taste: D, edible but nearly flavorless, just a hunk of hamburger meat in one and a hunk of spinach in the other. Presentation: D, dough was rock hard in spots so probably thawed in microwave just before stuffing.  Better than McDonalds but worse than Panera."}
{"text":"Falafel sandwich is decent, about what I expect from falafel. The grape leaves are on the small side and could have more flavor. The menu says you can get them hot or cold, but mine were given to me cold and I was not offered the option of hot."}
{"text":"Be careful. I ordered online and was given a subtotal. When I got to the restaurant they told me that the prices have changed from what was advertised online. Although it was their error (and false advertising) they had no compassion toward me for their error. Besides the food was rather poor for Greek cuisine."}
{"text":"Small eating space and tight parking. Excellent food, fresh ingredients, great selection to try. Excellent Shwarma choices, taboulli, pita & humus. Friendly staff, fast service, and clean."}
{"text":"After reading reviews for the Continental Grille, I would have expected more. I ordered the gyro platter, and was disappointed by the undercooked, bland gyro meat. Especially at 6pm on a Saturday, you'd expect a place like this to already have gyro meat prepared and ready to serve. I also tried the hummus topped with chicken shawarma, which was much better, and went well with the house-made pita bread.  I may have just been there on an off day, but I don't think I would recommend this place for Mediterranean food in Kent. The newer Troy Grille down the road might be a better option, but I've yet to try it myself."}
{"text":"Really friendly service.  Definitely a mom & pop joint.  I can't tell you how many people walked in and greeted the owner with \"Where's your wife?\"  It was cute. I ordered a falafel wrap.  It was pretty good.  I prefer my falafel a bit crispier but hey, this wasn't bad.  I'll be back & for one of there wonderful-looking salads next time.."}
{"text":"A wide selection of delicious foods, all of which can be seen or ordered in their interactive website menu, as well as on location. Fresh tabouli, hummus, babaghanoush, and much more is located up front by the register for those unfamiliar with such items. There is a bar located directly next to the kitchen where you can watch the chef cut your gyro meat directly off the shank and cook it. A nice atmosphere, nice staff, usually consisting of the owner and his wife as well as several friendly college aged employees. They seem willing to make sure that your dining experience is enjoyable and complete. The food is delicious and is competitively priced. The philly, and chicken philly, as well as the beef or chicken shawarma are excellent. They have always gotten my order correct no matter how it is customized. Main Street Continental also has some of the best french fries in Kent!"}
{"text":"A nice little place for a quick(ish) Mediterranean meal. Staff is pretty friendly, place is clean. Much faster to order carry out rather than order there (both take about 15-20 minutes, I just don't like waiting.) Pretty fairly priced, and there truly is something for everyone. I don't eat meat, so falafel is a staple for me, but plenty of my friends do, and they swear by the shish-kabob and shwarma sandwiches. They even have burgers, hot dogs for both carnivores and vegetarians alike!"}
{"text":"Great food!! I recommend the chicken kabob sandwich and the artichoke salad.   Also, THE BEST fries in the state -- Hands. Down.  Sometimes the service is slow, which is holding this place back from 5 stars."}
{"text":"Being Arabic, this place offers great Mediterranean food, but it's taste is definitely heavily influenced by western culture and loses the original and nostalgic taste of classic Arabic food.  With this being said, their hummus is great, but their falafel is decent. Fairly pricey, but what can you do."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and it really is the best. It is incredibly fresh- the manager refuses to serve subpar ingredients to the customers. They have options for many different diets. They are clean. They remember your usual and deliver it with a smile. Every customer is a member of the family. Honestly? You can't go wrong here. Get the grape leaves and one of the platter options- you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Very good fresh food with friendly service for under $10 a person?  Count me in!  Had a plate of falafel with hummus, and both were terrific.  Fresh veggies, fresh hummus, fresh everything.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The most Vegetarian and vegan friendly place in town. Small space, tight parking. Great service and good food. The food is very ethnic and definitely worth the money.  Being a vegetarian, my options are usually limited but at Main Street Continental Grill they have a wide variety of items to offer vegetarians and vegans. Food tastes fresh, never frozen and everything has a good flavor to it.  Other than the slightly steep prices, small space the place is great!"}
{"text":"This place deserves two stars for their food, but they get a third because the owners are such sweet people. The many times I've gone in, the owners have been attentive and nice, and I think that is worth mentioning.   My recent experience was pretty typical of my experiences here in general. I ordered a falafel sandwich, a gyro, and a spinach and feta pie. My falafel was somehow both undercooked and dry, with almost no tahini. Additionally, the radishes were limp and tasteless and the parsley was wilted. The meat portion in the gyro was pitiful, and while the menu describes it as being \"rolled in pita bread\", it was more like a pita taco with a bunch of lettuce spilling out of it. The spinach and feta pie I received was actually only spinach - no lemon, no garlic, no feta, just thawed frozen spinach wrapped in dough.  The food here is incredibly inconsistent, and to be really honest, it is baffling that this place wins \"best ethnic food in Kent\" every year. It has a lot of potential to be good, but the consistency is just not there. It's difficult for me to justify coming here because there's a good chance that at least half my food is off or not what I ordered. I want to see these nice people do well, but I after several years of giving them one more chance, I am unable to continue to support this business."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place at least once every week I am in town, sometimes two and three times a week.  I have tried the hummus, the falafel, chicken shawarma, beef shawarma, gyro meat, salads, meat pie's, spinach and feta pies, baklava, and even there french fries.  Needless to say I have sampled just about the whole menu.  The food quality is superb, it is fresh and made to order.  You can watch them cook it right there in front of you, and they are able to make adjustments to what you want.  Light on the sauce, extra olives, just ask.  The service is the best, after a few weeks, they started recognizing me, and even asked if I wanted the usual.  My usual is the Main Street Sandwich, which isn't made with the Lebanese bread, but a a spinach tortilla instead.  This puts a nice twist on the food, and is absolutely amazing.  On a whim, I asked for it with falafel instead of the normal chicken or beef, and I was just as happy.  If you are looking for a good place to get a quick, fresh, Mediterranean food, this is the only place to go in Kent!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but the service and atmosphere are awesome! The staff is really friendly and their menu is filled with a large number of options. Try the baba ghanoush."}
{"text":"Such a gem in Kent!  I would normally go to Aladdin's in Hudson, but this place has great authentic Mediterranean food.  I normally order the kafta plate and all meals come with pita bread and hummus (delicious).  They also deliver and have online ordering."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and they are very reasonably priced!  But go early, they are so good and make things so fresh, that they will run out of the pies and the grape leaves if you don't get there early enough.  I personally love the hummus, the meat pies, and the spinach pies."}
{"text":"Main Street Continental Grill is wonderful and an equally delicious but cheaper and more casual option compared to the superb local Mediterranean restaurant, Laziza, which is owned and operated by the same folks. Like Laziza, they are great for take-out but have less indoor seating.  There is also seating outside for those warmer months!  My favorite dishes include their fantastic Chicken Shawarma sandwich (really a wrap), Shish-ka-bob or Gyro platters, and the Mishwi Salad with Chicken Shawarma.  Add the optional (and extra but worth it) basmati rice and cucumber sauce to a chicken shawarma mishwi salad and you'll have an off-menu item known as the \"Nicole salad\" which is my absolute fave.  The hummus and falafel are great and I would also totally recommend their soups. The lentil is incredibly flavorful and warming and the lava lentil is a very different spicy \"hot sauce\" take which is also tasty and hearty but, in my opinion, completely pales in comparison to the traditional lentil."}
{"text":"Shish kabab, chicken kabab, and kafta sandwiches are delicious. Also, their shawarma platter is delicious too. Food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Great food! Always fresh and the service is very quick. The owner is a great guy who cares about his customers. You can usually eat for under $10! AMAZING french fries as well. If you like healthy food, this is the place for you.  $15 minimum for delivery orders- but well worth it."}
{"text":"Good, affordable mediterranean food is hard to come by - unless you're living in Kent.  Friendly staff, prompt service, and good food makes for a great time.  Plus, it's right off of campus, which makes it super-convenient for students to head there for lunch!  Somewhat unexpectedly, one of the best items on the menu is the fries, a decidedly un-authentic dish, but they're damn good all the same.  The hummus is tasty as well.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot located directly across from the Kent State Campus. Such a great alternative to pizza and burgers!"}
{"text":"Not the best place to dine in, but the food is great, the service is friendly and personable, and it's cheap.  I work across the street, so I'm here at least once a week."}
{"text":"So yummy! It's one of my favorite places to eat! I love their French fries and hummus (try them dipping your fries in it! It's golden!) NOM NOM NOM!"}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS SO GOOD!! 4 of us ate in, and it didn't take long for the food to come. I got a gyro platter, which came with rice, veggies, and hummus with pita. I also ordered french fries which were super crispy! The restaurant itself is pretty small, so it's more of a take out place or on-the-go. Also, my friend got the falafel platter. The falafel was crunchy and delicious. The tabouli was perfect--very zingy and fresh. Lastly, the baklava was good, but a little soft and not too crispy. Overall, this is an affordable and DELICIOUS dive!"}
{"text":"With a fast food-esque style Continental Grill is a great impulse and planned place to be. Their decently sized menu cookie cuts everything you'd expect for a good Mediterranean restaurant. I've had many items that have never been a disappointment but also never outstanding. Their hidden treasure is definitely their fries, which may be on my top 5 best fries list.   The owner is always around, helpful, and nice which can be all the difference. Small seating area that keeps it homey and close to campus for all the students to grab a lunch and a polar pop at Circle K next door.   A must try and go back -- remember, get the fries.  - @ZakirGhazi"}
{"text":"Adorable middle eastern cafe in an area by campus overwhelmed by cookie cutter fast food joints. The outside of the joint looks deceiving (perhaps was a burger place back in the day) but the inside is cozy, and welcoming with lots of warm colours. I have already been a couple of times and have tried their falafel, chicken schwarma, tabouli, fatoush, and hummus. I have been in love with the lava lentil soup since it's spicy and hearty for a cold, Kent fall day. I highly recommend skipping the faceless burger joints and heading over to Main Street grill if you are near Main St/front campus."}
{"text":"I've been going here with great success for years, but after tonight (June 2), I will not be returning any time soon. At 6:40, I placed an order for a beef shawarma platter, a mixed grill, and an order of hummus / pita bread. The girl that took my order let me know that I could pick it up in 20-25 minutes. When I arrived at 7:00 she gave me a total that was not reflective of what I ordered. When I pointed out that the items she described were not mine, she asked what I ordered. When I told her, the cook came over and they looked through the order slips without success.  He then proclaimed that I hadn't called. Really?  Who knew a cook had such omnipotent powers.  He persisted in his assertion that I hadn't called even after I pulled out my phone, went to recent calls, and called the number again in front of him.  His omnipotence challenged, he returned to his cooking duties, still asserting that I had not called. Who says that to a customer?  It's ridiculous and rude.   Although they had clearly made a mistake, I sat down at the counter still wanting to purchase food.  And waited. Nothing - I was ignored. When I worked food service, my response would have been something along the lines of: \"I'm sorry that happened. Let me get your food started right away.\"  Nope. Nothing.  Perhaps they were embarrassed by their incompetency?  Unfortunately, I don't think they realize how poorly they handled the situation.  I walked out.  I'm sure Mr. Awad would be mortified that one of his loyal customers was treated in this manner."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mediterranean food!  I always like this place, but a tad overpriced.  Haven't had better shwarma since I was in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Simple presentations of good Greek food, with a large menu. Everything I've tried has been a success.   I'm a particular fan of the hummus, so much so that I order the appetizer and also get a plate that includes more. Some of the best I've ever had, with fresh pita.  Very few seats inside, but I go at off hours and have never had a problem. Also, there's ample parking in the back."}
