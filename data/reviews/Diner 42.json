{"text":"What a great find and truly a perfect place.  Great food, great prices and even better service.  Enjoy and don't judge a book by its cover and go in and experience this gem."}
{"text":"Very good food and a good value for the family. Not at all fancy, but everyone's meals were fresh and delicious. Our family of 5 ate for around $26, including beverages- that never happens. Very friendly staff.  We will definitely come back. Would be good for take out, too."}
{"text":"The good news - I have eaten here twice and the food is pretty good and the prices are excellent.

The bad news - The food does take a little longer than expected to come out, the decor is horrible, parking is in the back in a dirt and gravel lot.  The TV both times was playing Frazier from Netflix.  If they have Netflix, just subscribe to asking and play live TV such as Food Network or ESPN.

I also tried to order via phone so I wouldn't have to wait.  The owner who answered the phone said that couldn't be done.  They couldn't write down and order and hand it to the chef so it could be ready when I arrived?  That is weak sauce.

The owner is nice and since it is so close to where I live, I would love to see the place succeed.  Small changes could really make Diner-42 successful long term."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I enjoyed the tenders as well as the Italian Roast Beef! The Au Ju is so yummy and it was to die for ! I love the fries! I tried to recreate them for my family and they do not like them as much as they like the Diners! Keep up the great work! Cant wait to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and even better prices. It is not fancy and no waiters, but the food and prices make up for the extras that you won't miss them at all. The fries are the bomb...I love fresh cut fries. The burger was fresh and I took home corn salsa and ate the whole container the next day!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Best burger I have had in many years! Fries fresh cut and hot!  Would not have guessed walking into the back of a house that this place would be any good.  Also, cheaper than McDs."}
{"text":"I have eaten there 3 times and i will be back there very nice and there food was good, there front patio is done and me  and my daughter ate on there new  patio it was awsome. and there prices are great. thanks Diner 42"}
{"text":"Great little gem!  Extremely friendly staff.  Had the sliced steak sandwich, meatball flatbread and a cheeseburger and all were really good.  Don't pass up the salsa sampler too- although some of the chips were bottom of the baggers.  Really enjoyed our time here and once the front porch is done, it'll be nice to eat outside!"}
{"text":"Only thing to say is good old fashion diner food at a great price. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good little place. Cooks your food to order, and prices really can't be beat. Fries were really good, burger was good and drinks are including in the combo price. Worth a look."}
