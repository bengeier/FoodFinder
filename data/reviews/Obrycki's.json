{"text":"I had the chicken Chesapeake wrap and it was quite tasty. Service was efficient and timely."}
{"text":"I came here during a layover. I ordered the buffalo chicken tenders. For the price it was an excellent surprise. I got several big tenders for under $10.

The taste was good. Waitress asked me if I wanted fries, I added them. They were ok and only $3.

This place looks pretty classy and offers fish items as well. A pretty good selection of bottled and tap beers as well."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my choice the menu description made the hand breaded buffalo shrimp tossed in a mild buffalo sauce sound appealing it wasn't appealing, tasty or fulfilling in anyway ( see photo). They do brag on the crab cakes so I might give them another opportunity. The service was slow the servers were friendly but not motivated considering this is an airport and most people have a tight schedule. The beer tasted fresh but a few degrees colder would of been nice. Back to the lack of motivation the place seemed a little messy not dirty just in disarray. The pricing didn't offend me too much considering the location $16.00 for the 6 shrimp warm celery and a beer."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a bite to eat and a drink during an airport layover. Nothing fancy about this place, but it does the job."}
{"text":"Eh.

Pricey for even an airport bar, with beer being particularly bad ($9 for a pint?  Really?).  Service was decent though."}
{"text":"So, Cleveland does not have a reputation for great seafood. Which should have been enough to steer me away from an airport place trying to recreate a Baltimore crab restaurant. But in a lapse of judgment, I gave it a try. 

I ordered the shrimp and crab flatbread, because I wasn't super hungry, didn't want to spend a ton of money, and hate cucumbers and iceberg lettuce. Ok. 

The whole thing was the color of dead grass. The first few bites were ok, then it was just bland and kind of rubbery and can-flavored. 

The table next to me had a plate with a few abandoned lettuce leaves and some red onions on it. The plate sat there uncleared the entire time I was in the restaurant, onion scent wafting my way as numerous staff members walked past the table multiple times. Ugh.

When a guy a few tables over asked how long it would take for the food to arrive, the waitress told him, \"all our food is programmed to come out in 10 minutes.\" No wonder it looks and tastes like mass-produced dreck. That's exactly what it is. 

The service was quick and pleasant. Too bad the place didn't offer up a better product. There are restaurants that serve great food fast. This isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Every time I fly through CLE I get stuck on an extended layover, thank God for small miracles because this place keeps me sane. They have excellent waitstaff, a full bar with good prices and the food is pretty good and also priced well. The food is a bit on the oily side so I can't give it 5 stars but I do always come back so it's worth a 4. The seats are large and comfy, it tends to be quiet and the staff lets you do your thing without bugging you. I have spent many hours on my laptop eating and drinking here while waiting for flights."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Obrycki's. The food, obviously the crab, is pretty darn delicious.

However the beauty of an airport restaurant is the quick service, this restaurant lacks that element. It could have been because of the Christmas holiday that they were limited in staff, but with the uptick in prices at an airport restaurant, that shouldn't be an excuse.

Word of advice, head to this Obrycki's for the usual good food, but if you have a short layover, don't be surprised if you miss your flight."}
{"text":"For a seafood establishment, the crab had an overwhelming fishy taste. The service is horrible. Waited almost 10 minutes before walking to the bar to ask the bartender if there was a server. She said yes and went back to her conversation with a couple at the bar. Low and behold- it was her. Super rude and clueless. I wouldn't recommend this place under any circumstance."}
{"text":"I had to drop it down from four stars for their poor customer service.  The fresh crab was quite delicious, and the coffee is served very hot, so I was happy.  All in all it was a nice layover at this terminal, but would I stop back a second time? I think not.  Having been to Baltimore years ago and practically living there the three years I was in the area, I asked if the crab was from Chesapeake Bay, and the answer is no, and sometimes it's even frozen?  At least he was honest.

I recommend it if you are in the mood for seafood, but otherwise find another joint to use their fork & spoon.  The guy poured my coffee and dissapeared in the back for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.  Don't expect anything healthy on the menu.  Salads are out of the 50s - iceberg lettuce.  At best, you can consider it pub food.  After a few pints, you'll be satisfied with the food.  Small selection.  Another terminal has the Great Lakes Brewing Company and they have an expansive menu with all sorts of options to tempt your taste buds."}
{"text":"I didn't get to enjoy the full experience here since my majorly delayed flight was bumped up about 1 minute after my meal arrived.  But the somewhat lackluster service up until that point was made up for by the rapid response to grab me a to-go box with all the necessary items and speedy processing of my check.

Also, I have to say that my cocktail (sea breeze!) was very good and the fish and chips were delicious.  I can't comment on the cole slaw as I didn't think it would make for good finger food on my flight!"}
{"text":"With their all day breakfast menu at premium airport prices it was almost enough to forget how slow and unhappy most of the staff is at this location. When spoons have become too dangerous to stir your own coffee. Offering an extra knife is the best way to go staff."}
{"text":"I have vitited the original Obrycki's and experienced the bucket of boiled crab poured onto the table, and then diving in to enjoy.  Well, if you are expecting this, forget it.  But hey, this is Cleveland and it is an airport.  Taking that into account our experience was pretty good, far surpassing much airport food.  The servers could have been more friendly and welcoming, but my fish and salad (trying to eliminate carbs, so no chips/fries :( ) was good and my Honey loved her crab cake.  Stuck in Hopkins airport for a while? - mosey over to terminal D and enjoy Obrycki's"}
{"text":"A stunning example of just how low most people's expectations are willing to fall when eating dinner at airports.  I was starving but also in the mood for something on the light and refreshing side - so I ordered a \"wedge salad\" which I normally would rather have my gums scraped than order this otherwise absolutely nonsensical concoction.  I was expecting a nice piece of fresh romaine lettuce but instead I got a gross wilted outer edge of a head of iceberg lettuce, drenched in crumbles of blue cheese and an hardboiled egg thrown on the side - one of the most depressing salads I've ever seen - absolutely dreadful.

I took a chance at trying a wedge salad, and I paid for it - just as I took a chance at dining at Obrycki's."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the \"famous\" crab cake. It beats the heck out of the Phillip's ones from the Baltimore and Dulles airports. Plenty of crab, only one tiny sliver of cartilage. Really good flavor too. My complaint is that there are no other sides to substitute if you don't want fries or cole slaw. It would be a much healthier choice if there was a veggie option...but hey...it's an airport bar thing. I'm not expecting much. 

The service was kind of bristly, but then I sat at the bar while I waited for my carryout order (I ate on the plane). My food was hot and fresh and I had it in-hand in about 7 minutes. Without the speed, it would've been a 3-star."}
{"text":"Hm.  Wandering the terminal during a layover I spotted Obrycki's and thought \"Aha!  Polish name, Cleveland, maybe I'll have some pierogi...\" But no.  It's a seafood place out of Baltimore.  (After I ate, found the Great Lakes Brewing location in another terminal, and they have pierogi... ah, well.)

The service was very good.  The prices are a bit high, even for an airport location. But I have to say, the crab cakes were almost worth it.  Very nicely made, big pieces of crab, not much filler.  I had the devilled ones, fried; just a hint of spice, fried just right, so good... Came with good fries and slaw.

I had fried mozzarella, too.  Not so good.  Almost definitely frozen, and with a forgettable marinara.  Oh, well.  The crab cakes saved the meal.

Airport dining options are always limited, of course, and each restaurant only has a limited version of its normal menu.  The other decent options here were Great Lakes and Gordon Biersch."}
{"text":"Pretty good airport fare! Had a cup of the crab soup, which was really tasty. Also had the chicken fingers, and was very surprised how many there were on the plate for an appetizer. Nothing to write home about, but far from the worst I've had. Service was really friendly and fast, perfect for a bite between flights."}
{"text":"Crab cake sliders were good but the bartender was very busy even though there were literally 7 people in the whole place, so I went next door to get another drink"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a drink while waiting on my flight and the service was not the best.  The prices of drinks were steep even for an airport."}
