{"text":"Stopped by after work to get a custom sushi burrito. Got one with salmon and extra toppings.
Comparing to other places, the size and amount of ingredients are awesome, it's huge and filling with right amount of rice. Everything tastes fresh and simply delicious. A bit on a pricey side, but that's what you'd expect, if you went to sushi burrito places before."}
{"text":"This place was my first Poke bowl experience and I really enjoyed it.

I made my own poke bowl:
Soba Noodles
Tuna and Salmon
Edamame and Jicama
Spicy Gochu Mayo
plus freebies

I can't believe how fresh and delicious it was. I will definitely go back. One downside is that, it's very small inside, so you need to go off hours to get a seat."}
{"text":"- poke itself was excellent. generous amount of fish and variety of toppings
- kind and attentive service
- price is $14-15 per bowl"}
{"text":"My first ever sushi burrito. It taste like a giant Maki but they put good fillings inside to make it a little different like seaweed salad. It's big and filling. I wouldn't eat this everyday but definitely would come back and try the poke bowls."}
{"text":"I ordered a classic tuna poke bowl with sushi rice and was delighted to have experienced such a tasty surprise. It had flaked panko-fried onion, cabbage, crab and thin slices of pickled ginger which was healthy, affordable and much tastier than the original I had had in Honolulu. If you're new to Hawaiian order this classic dish and you'll not even think to stray off the beaten path with the more adventurous ones. Sometimes simple is spot on!"}
{"text":"I got a poke bowl and wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. All the flavors melt in your mouth. What was even more outstanding than the food was the service, they were very helpful and patient while I made my choice."}
{"text":"The make yourself poke bowl was delicious though the portion is a bit too big for me. Would definitely visit again when I'm visiting Toronto again"}
{"text":"Went with the spicy salmon poke bowl consisting of sushi rice, spicy mayo, crispy onions, seaweed and added mandarin oranges and guacamole. The poke bowl was delicious and the size portion was very sizable, bigger than other poke bowls I had! All the ingredients tasted really fresh. The spicy salmon was not spicy though for some reason though.

Service was excellent and the staff was extremely friendly.  There is also a fair amount of seating in the place. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Good food, pleasant staff. I recommend getting the extra protein for a few bucks more otherwise the bowl is light for the price. The staff were courteous and explained some of the options available. Food was fresh, and prepared quickly. Great place for a quick lunch or light meal."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a very healthy meal and enjoy raw seafood, this is the place to be. For about $15, you can get a delicious coconut shrimp bowl with some seaweed, roe, and crab meat (not sure if it was imitation) all on top of your choice of brown rice, sushi rice, or soba noodles.

The shrimp bowl I ordered had a very distinct flavour that I wanted to keep eating. It was very satisfying with a feeling of self pride for eating healthy (which I never do).

For my first Hawaiian food experience, I was impressed and will try again if given the chance. Give this place a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I got 420 bowl, tuna and salmon, and it was so tasty. I've tried poke before, but this one is the best one for me!
People and place are also nice. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The 420 poke bowl is amazing! Always fresh and delicious. 
Staff is also always super friendly and wait times are short."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Lots of options for toppings. Clean atmosphere and large seating area compared to other poke places. I'm giving it a 3 star because I like my poke simple and I find the combination of toppings and flavours mixed together are overwhelming. It doesn't reflect the traditional poke experience (simple, meant to enjoy quality fish), but this seems to be a Toronto bastardization of poke and Pikito is not the only culprit. I do find this place nicer than Poke Guys."}
{"text":"Amazing flavour and portion size.   The regular was filling and worth the price. Would def go back."}
{"text":"Came here last night for Poké week and after much anticipation, I wasn't completely wowed.  Our bowl was customized and what was different about it from the other places we've gone to, was that they added flavour with this seasoning which did give it some heat.  I did like the heat, however, it was later on overpowering.  I personally like heat and although I can take a lot of it, I would prefer to not lose any of the other flavours.  I basically couldn't tell how fresh the fish really was with the seasoning.  Was still enjoyable but mostly in the beginning before the heat just kind of killed it.  I would go back to try it but I would definitely tell them to ease up on the spice.  Less is more.  3/5.

What I must say though is that the service was very welcoming and attentive.  That alone would make me want to go back and try out more of their bowls and possibly even their burritos."}
{"text":"Unfortunately (and it's very unfortunate, indeed) I have to amend my review on Pokito as they recently (?) changed their menu/pricing. 

Pokito was my favourite place because I always had a go-to. I believe a year or so ago, they offered bowls at the same price but you get to choose 4-5 toppings, and some of the more expensive toppings would count as 2. 

I went back there yesterday to discover that that was no longer the case and you can only choose 2 toppings! So I was stuck between the choice of choosing a pre-fixed bowl (with no option to substitute) and choosing the spicy creamy salmon which is my usual order, and only choosing 2 toppings. I chose the former and I did NOT enjoy the toppings that it came with. I understand that the cost of food has probably gone up, but I was too spoiled with the prior menu choice to settle for less now. To add to this change, Pokito is quite far away from me so I will no longer be trekking to Queen and Spadina for a sub-par poke bowl. 

Currently on the hunt for a new favourite poke place. Suggestions are welcome."}
{"text":"Was looking to try a poke bowl or sushi burrito store for forever when I stumbled across this little gem on Queen St W. 

The best part of this shop is that everything is customizable. They have clear instructions on how many types of ingredients you can add to your meal, and additional add-ins are available for reasonable prices. Employees were really friendly and knowledgable! 

They have daily specials which I highly recommend as the price difference is vast! I got the 4/20 bowl which is tuna and salmon and WOW IT WAS AN AMAZING MEAL! 

Dying to go here again and I recommend this play for all!"}
{"text":"OK SERIOUSLY HANDS DOWN THE BEST POKE BOWL IVE HAD!!!! ID TOTALLY COME BACK IF I DIDNT LIVE SO FAR AWAY ): 
Everything had a hint of lime in it which I thought really hit that \"Hawaiian\" style taste. I got the 420 style bowl because I didn't want to make my own and have it turn out bad LOL but regardless, you can still customize it on top of the style that you choose! I love their avocado wasabi sauce! And their guac was on point too. Totally would come here more often. 

P.S the employees were really chill and I loved their music taste HAHAHA"}
{"text":"Located in queen west area which has a lot of busy and popular  reataurants nearby.

I was excited to try their poke because yelp reviews were so good but ..

For me it was a bit disappointing.

First price is little expensive considering on their portion and quality. 

They put small portion of fish than other poke places.

They have scallop poke on the menu which is unique and I was excited to try that one.

I thought it would be sushi grade scallop..

But it was just from frozen regular small cooked scallop.

Their poke ..Taste was okay but not wow taste.

Btw their interior and atmosphere is the best among the other poke places.

Also they have very organized system on taking order and making poke!

Every details (table, chair,menu.. etc) in the store look pretty, cute and clean."}
{"text":"My favourite poke place so far. All their toppings are good especially the guac. A little pricey but they have daily specials. I've only had the poke bowls here so I don't know how the burritos are. This is def a frequent lunch spot of mine."}
{"text":"I've tried a number of poke places around this city and this one is by far the best I have ever had. From the food to the friendly workers who are always having fun to the delicious iced tea they let us sample for free.  TRY THIS PLACE. I can't recommend it enough. I've gone back a few times and tried all different types. 420 Bowl is my favorite. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Damn, this is really good. So excited that Poke has come to Toronto. The best I previously had was in Southern California and this is up there. Impressive. And the options they offer for customization (marinades, garnishes, rice vs. salad) are awesome. A must visit."}
{"text":"Tuna was fresh and they give you lots of yummy toppings! One of the best poke bowls I've had in T.O.! The service was also great. The guy was very friendly and recommended I did half sushi rice and half garlic rice since I was unsure."}
{"text":"One hit wonder.  It's a fad but it just didn't hit the spot.  I got the 420 burrito but it was very messy and lacked a lot of fish.  I'm from the states and food culture in Toronto is definitely lacking"}
{"text":"Since leaving LA I've been on the hunt for the best poke in Toronto and so far this has definitely made the cut! The best poke I've had in Toronto! 

I really like that they marinated the crab meat to add that extra flavour. Portion size is super generous for the price (vs. other restaurants), they also drown the protein in sauce (I like my food saucy) and they have lots of toppings to choose from (and they don't limit you to how many you can pick). The sushi rice tasted amazing - not too bland or too much vinegar. 
The restaurant itself had AC (thank you!), brightly lit and spacious.
I would definitely recommend trying them out and I will most definitely return."}
{"text":"After having gone to LA many times for AMAZING poke I decided to give this a try in Toronto. One word... Disappointing. 

I got the 420 which is apparently their most popular dish. You barely get any fish (and it's chewy). There is no special sauces. Barely any toppings (they didn't ask us at least if we wanted any)... And who puts guacamole on poke?! 

Ill stick to getting poke in LA where you get a good amount of fish and tons of awesome delicious toppings with great sauces. 

Thanks for trying, but try harder. 

- Furious Pete"}
{"text":"Out of the few in the downtown area, Pokito delivers the best all-around experience. Great spot out on Queen west, the store is bright, minimalistic, and plays good jams. Compared to their competitors, they offer ample seating and better decor.

Two entree options here - sushi burrito or a poke bowl. I saw the sushi burritos that the people in front of me had ordered, and could see the staff struggle to roll them up properly and hold them all together. Since I have a strong dislike for soggy nori, I suggest sticking with the traditional bowl, which you can fully customize, or pick from their pre-selected options.

Pokito is unfortunately one of the more expensive poke options, but in my opinion, worth  the few extra bucks."}
{"text":"Showed up here just as they were closing earlier than normal so they did not have all the ingredients ready at hand. I went for the spicy salmon, which in itself lacked the kick I was expecting. 

The staff were accommodating and friendly though and did not shoo use out even after they locked up. 

The location is in a busy spot on Queen West and the restaurant has decent seating and space."}
{"text":"I am now a poke convert. Since I've always loved sushi, and always appreciate trying out the cuisines of different cultures, it was only natural that I stop by Pokito for a poke bowl. Ingredients are very fresh and I suggest going at lunch when they are at the freshest. I happen to go in the middle of the week so there was plenty of seating, but I could see this place getting busy on weekends. While I was eating I noticed some stuff take photos for their Instagram or so forth, and I found that a bit funny. However, they are new business and I can't wait for them to soar. Very tasty, give it a try even if you're not the sushi type. You'll be pleasantly surprised! I also have to give them props for introducing Toronto to Hawaiian culture, rather than do an asian fusion replay a.k.a. sushi burrito type of thing, that is slightly silly and overworked."}
{"text":"My first poke experience in Toronto.  I remember my favorite in Hawaii that was super simple.  I tried the spicy salmon bowl.  It was tasty lots of stuff inside like the toppings and stuff but sometimes simple is best.  Tasted good and I had brown rice.  The others had plain rice and mentioned it was hard.  Nice staff and accommodated to make me some hot water to warm my baby's bottle.  For going that extra mile I was very happy cause they don't keep hot water on hand.  Disappointed dole whip wasn't available but on the menu."}
{"text":"Hits and misses but great efforts on their first day of opening -- a solid 3.5 (okay poké!) plus a likely return visit. Here's why:

- the 420 BURRITO ($15.95) -- tuna & salmon with ponzu lime sauce, pickled onion and cucumber, and Hawaiian guacamole. This thing is massivo! Pricey but worth-it-pricey cause it is FILLING. Ontop of the standard fillings, you also get to choose two add-ins. I'm pretty sure we covered the vast majority of the fillings: guac, pineapple chow (a tasty pineapple salad of sorts), shredded crab salad, tamago (sweet egg), pickled onion & cucumbers, mango... You could say it's overkill but damn it was pretty exciting to eat. The nice thing is all the flavours more or less meld well together so it's just a preference of what you like to eat. My only beef was one item was far too lemony potent (the onions? Ponzu sauce?) that it was kind of intrusive. Tip if you get this tho, eat in! After all was said and done (i.e. Asian Grace -- pics first!), it was already getting soggy (possibly the overkill of fillings..)

The burrito was split between two of us and we probably would've been sufficiently satiated at that point. But what's the fun in that?

- THAI COCONUT SHRIMP RICE BOWL ($12.95) -- supremely underwhelmed by this one. The coconut kaffir shrimp was so plain that I almost wanted to ask whether they had forgotten the sauce, except I obviously saw it pre-prepared with the jicama (juicy but less sweet than expected). Served alongside lemongrass garlic corn that I also wouldnt have known should've been flavoured had I not read the menu. The good thing that came of this bowl was that we tested out the remainder of the fillings not in the burrito so was able to try the wood ear mushrooms (kikurage) and seaweed salad -- both solid options. Crispy bits (fried onions and fried faro strips) in both burrito and bowl are nice contrasts. 

All pieces of protein are nice and chunky, so no skimping which I appreciated. All the sauces sound super appealing so I have no doubt I'll hit a home run soon enough if I build my own combo.

There's still a bit of a learning curve for the Subway-style production line crew, which makes for a bit of a wait but I think Torontonians will be flocking here in masses so they'll get the hang of things soon enough. But while you're waiting, you get a sneak peek of the dope rice presser which makes for an even layer of rice on the nori (seaweed) and therefore means you won't get hunks of plain rice in any one bite."}
{"text":"This is my go to place if I am craving a poke bowl. It has great daily specials and I usually get the creamy spicy salmon poke bowl. I like how they give you an option for your base like sushi rice, brown rice, and more and you can do half-half if you want. I usually like the pokito style (where you let them add the ingredients) instead of choosing the extra toppings yourself.

After waiting for a little bit, my order was ready. The poke was serve in a clear bowl and all the ingredients look fresh. After mixing it, it looks great and very appetizing. Overall, great poke place in Toronto.

The only thing is the price point is pretty high for a bowl size but the daily special price makes up for it.

The decor and interior is pretty modern and they have free wifi which is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Poke places are popping up like pimples before picture day and I've tried my share in the city.  I would have to say this is one of my favs.  I've tried the bowls and burritos for different Pokito signatures and the winner is the 420 bowl (salmon & tuna with ponzu line sauce, sweet onions, cucumbers, Hawaiian guacamole) with my choices of brown rice, Indonesian acar (pickled cucumbers), crab salad, and all the free topping. Yum nom nom!

I like this place because you can customize your meal so that every visit can be different.  The base can be white rice, brown rice or soba noodle (not applicable to burrito which can only be white rice). Then you can pick 2 gourmet toppings: Hawaiian guacamole, kikurage, Indonesian acar, seaweed salad, crab salad, lemongrass garlic Corn, pineapple chow, olive bell peppers - all are delicious. And finish it all off with your choice of freebies.

Ratio of base to toppings is gracious and portions size to price is on point.  There are tons of seats and the staff are hilarious.

Tip: get a stamp card - free dole after 5 meals and free poke after 10."}
{"text":"Noticed this joint from across the street when I was in the Queen West area. Apparently they had redone their menu the day of so I was one of the first people to try their new offerings.

The menu can be a little confusing but then again it might just be me. If you're easily confused, the staff are friendly and helpful.

It does seem a bit on the expensive side, especially if you get a drink too, but the presentation is pleasing to the eye and from what I can tell, healthy too.

All in all, definitely a good place to stop by if you want something fast, well - that's all up to how picky you are, yet healthy!"}
{"text":"There's been a Poke craze in Toronto lately. I've already tried 3 of these Poke eateries, and while I was not impressed with any of them, this one is slightly above average. The value is not great, it's quite pricey for what it is. I understand that fish is expensive, but they don't put enough of it to justify the price. I can get a whole box full of sashimi for less during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Very good Pokito! I love this healthful lunch and could get used to it. I had the 420 on sushi rice which comes with tuna and salmon. Even though it looks like a dog's breakfast, poke bowls are packed with well thought out ingredients. Just like ordering at a Subway, you pick your style of bowl and choose the toppings. The topping are quite creative and there are a dizzying array of them. My order, without a drink, was about $16 so it wasn't cheap but the effort that goes into the ingredients was impressive making this a treat of a meal. Next time I will try their jalapeno topping to add some spiciness that seemed missing from the dish. Think sushi without the wasabi or ginger. It's a great idea for a snack and I hope they can keep up their momentum here in the city."}
{"text":"I've been on a poke binge. I went during their grand opening. After all the hype, I had such high expectations. It was nothing special and the rice was hard. It was spicy mayo on barely any fish, and alot of fillers. I thought the corn was a weird option on poke."}
{"text":"The staff are so so friendly here! They really want you to have the best and get something that you for sure will like. The guy at the front really took his time to make sure I love what I was getting. Props to him!! 

The bowl was pretty darn awesome! 

You get to pick whether you want your meal in a bowl or a burrito format. Then you get to pick what you want whether it's a custom one or pre-made order. 

They make the bowls fairly quickly.

Also, They don't skimp out on the shrimp!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the daily special - spicy salmon bowl. Pretty good. Nice textures with the different ingredients. You get options for base - garlic brown rice, sushi rice and mixed green."}
{"text":"Went with my co-workers on opening day.

I'd have to guess that we probably got food poisoning based on the fact that only 1/3 people made it into work the next day.

They're really generous with their fish though. That's an ironic plus.

#Goodtimes"}
{"text":"I was here yesterday for the grand opening. I got two spicy salmon bowls because of their BOGO promotion. Although I was a bit early than the time stated on the promotion they were kind enough to let me get the offer. Five stars for their customer service. While making my poke bowl a piece of the salmon fell onto the sauce bottles and instead of putting it in, my server threw it out as should be done. I appreciated that! For topping I got corn, mango, and avacado, and seaweed salad. All were delicious. I didn't find the salmon spicy though."}
{"text":"Meh. I've had better bowls. The flavours in the classic tuna are nice for sure. The 18$ tag is t though for the small size. 

Also these guys have no idea where any of their fish comes from which is pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"I ordered the 420 bowl last night from UberEats, on the sole basis that it came with guacamole. Sadly it arrived without it. The rest of the meal tasted great and was super fresh. But I was super disappointed by the lack of guac. Not sure if they ran out or maybe forgot? The portion was also on the small side compared to what I was expecting, the reviews I've read said the portion was quite large. Wondering if they scaled back for food cost or maybe it would have been more filling with the avo. I would try again if I went to the restaurant but not likely to order delivery again."}
{"text":"Food: 9/10 -- Value: 6/10 -- Service: 9/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 7/10

Would I come again? Yes, to try the burrito.

The good stuff:
------------
- Great taste; so many flavours in one bowl
- Variety of ingredients and toppings
- Staff are suuuuuuuuper friendly and enthusiastic

Room for improvement:
------------
- Ordering process isn't perfect. They try to present it as very simple, but it's actually a little unclear if you can add freebie toppings to the set bowls. The first time, they asked. The second time, they added all but one without asking. 
- Price. I found $15 for the bowl too pricey. It wasn't very filling and was a bit on the small side. Pokito was opened in part by Chatime, so the overpriced menu makes sense.
- Way too little sashimi. It's pretty much one spoonful and makes the price even less justifiable. 
- Inventory management. The first time I went, they had no more salmon at 6:00pm, four hours before closing. The second time I went, at 9:00pm, they ran out of white rice and couldn't make sushi burritos."}
{"text":"This is my first poke experience, and I gotta say, Pokito has made me a fan! I had the sss scallop poke bowl with pineapple slaw, crab salad, seaweed salad, all the crispy toppings, nori, tobiko, soba and greens. With so much going on, I really didn't know what to expect. The result was sensational! It really combined everything that I like eating and made it into a taste bud bonanza. My only comment would be that next time I'd like a bit less sauce. The sauce really pulled everything together with a bit of a kick.

Hubs had the salmon and tuna burrito roll. That was a tad underwhelming for me though. The texture of the rice with 'squishy' nori and all the ingredients didn't pull together as well for me. I'd definitely try the combo in a bowl though next time to see if that works any better.

The atmosphere is casual and cafeteria like. The staff are super helpful and friendly. It wasn't busy when we dropped by so they were able to spend a lot of time explaining the options to us.

It looks like they also have a pineapple soft serve for $3.50! I'll have to try that next time."}
{"text":"Was slightly disappointed, the service was slow and the menu for toppings was confusing. 

I ordered the spicy salmon burrito and was underwhelmed. It was just ok, it was under seasoned and pricey. I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Stingy with the protein, expensive for what you get and fairly unproffesional staff working that don't seem to know what they're doing. Go to Cali love instead."}
{"text":"as i am experimenting all the different poke places in Toronto, i stumbled across this place with my pal. the workers are very sweet and will help you if you are confused on how/what to order. the portion size is pretty good, i didnt feel terribly full after but not hungry either. the only issue is the price!! i can go to another place and get a larger portion for like 5 dollars less. and it sucks how making your bowl into a burrito costs an extra dollar. the food was good but a little over priced for my student taste."}
{"text":"was curious about the poke craze and so when I passed by pokito and that it was not as crowed as the sandwiches I decided to go in. I hate heard from Hawaiian friends about poke and the delicious fish, the rice and the seasoning. I decided to get the 420 as the sales person recommended as the best first taste of poke. Rice (cold), salmon, tuna, guacamole, pineapple, crispy taro, Wakame salad and more. All pretty health ingredients and a good size for $14. I find the taste pleasant not extraordinary and addictive I wish it had more punch but the marriage of texture is good but feels too soft in the end. I cannot justify the high pricing for a well furnished rice bowl."}
{"text":"I had the sushi burger when I visited the shop and it was not bad! The wait was a little long but was understandable since they had to fry the rice. Unfortunately the rice was only pan fried one one side so the burger started breaking apart halfway through. Lots of flavour however the bulgogi had a lot of seasoning but not too much where it's overbearing."}
{"text":"Had to check out the latest craze with the Poke bowls downtown. I like how fresh the options and free stuff they give with the bowls and how you can customize the bowl to your liking. Definitely better though to go with one of their specials versus creating your own. I did the create my own poke bowl and though it was quite flavorful, I don't think my concoction mixed as well as theirs. Tried some of my friends' sushi burrito and enjoyed it more. Will be back to try their burrito for sure."}
{"text":"Came here to check out the poke bowls. Really nice interior decor and design and very spacious place with lots of seating. A bit disappointed with the efficiency of their service and quality of ingredients in their poke bowls. Will not be coming back here again. 

Taste: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Price: 3/5
Portion: 3/5

Taste: ordered the scallop make your own poke bowls. Sea weed salad with sweet corn, guac and taro chips. Their ingredients are not that fresh and they are not very generous with the toppings. 

Service: staff are nice here but there are efficiencies that can be improved on. I didn't like having to repeat what I ordered to three different staff members one before the order, one to the person making the food then one to the person who was handling the till.

Atmosphere: this place is nicely decorated and designed and lots of space to sit. 

Price: $14 for a poke bowl 

Portion: portioned on the smaller side."}
{"text":"Delicious, and super friendly. The pineapple froyo is an awesome touch"}
{"text":"2 stars is only for the taste. 
I ordered Spicy salmon bowl with extra tofu and extra salmon. Firstly, they messed the order between me and my coworkers. One of my coworker was about to start eating his bowl(it is supposed to be mine) until I noticed that my bowl doesn't have any tofu in it. So because they gave wrong bowl to all of us, I almost lost about $5 on that($2 for extra tofu, $2 for extra salmon).
Secondly, portion of the salmon I had was just the same as my friend's, and he didn't even order the extra salmon. Extra tofu comes with only 4 pieces only. I get it that these type of dish is generally expensive but 4 pieces tofu for $2 and another $2 for extra salmon and ended up getting almost nothing?
And one of my coworker ordered brown rice and he didn't get it; 
one of my coworker ordered extra tuna and didn't get any...
Would not come back again....SU&BU,Cali Love, etc. are much better."}
{"text":"Came across this poke place when adventuring along Queen Street West today and decided to give it a try with my friend who never had any poke experience.  We had the 420 and spicy salmon.  Overall, I feel this place was just so so.  I had poke at a few different places and Pokito is pretty disappointment.  First of all, the portion is extremely small for the price.  Secondly, there seemed to be no AC in the store on a hot summer day like today.  It was super hot inside and my main concern was if the food (especially the raw fish) was gonna be fine in this environment.  Taste wise, it didn't match my liking - brown rice was too dried/hard (I actually ordered sushi rice but they gave me the wrong thing but didn't really bother to change it), spicy salmon too spicy that you couldn't really taste the fish, very sad looking bowl of poke.  I didn't really like any of pre-set bowls either, to be honest.  In my opinion, there seem to be plenty of options around the city if you have such budget for poke bowl or food."}
{"text":"I stopped by after tasting a couple different Poké bowl places in the area. Pokito is definitely amongst the fastest Poké bowl places I've been to, but it lacks in flavour and topping variety. I found the fried onions and other \"final toppings\" to be a bit distracting from the overall bowl.

Still on the hunt for my go-to Poké place."}
{"text":"2.5-3 stars.

I was really looking forward to trying out pokito because of chatime and me.nu collaborating. My cousin had the salmon burrito and I had the 420 bowl and you have a choice of white rice, brown rice or soba noodles. I chose brown rice which btw I think was undercooked. It was hard. The thing I liked about the bowl was it had a really nice flavouring to it and had a decent amount of tuna and salmon. The size of the bowl is a decent size but for the price I don't think it's something I'll buy often. 

My cousin thought the burrito was underwhelming which I agreed, it wasn't as flavourful as I thought it would be. Overall, it's quite pricey and there has been a lot of sushi burritos/ poke shops opening up lately. But unfortunately it's not the one for me."}
{"text":"My go-to is the 420 bowl. It comes with tuna & salmon with a ponzu lime sauce, sweet onion and cucumber, diced pineapples, seaweed salad, and guacamole. The ingredients in this bowl complements each other really well - packed with flavour in each bite. 

However the downside to their poke bowls is the amount of rice there is - there always seems to be way too much than I actually need. Their prices are also quiet expensive for what you get. The 420 bowl is almost $20 after tax which is kinda insane.. there isn't enough tuna or salmon either at this price. 

I'd probably come back but it'd be a treat if I do!"}
{"text":"The place is well maintained. The staff seems to be really nice and friendly. Ingredient wise, the salmon and tuna that I had was fresh. However, it felt a bit too greasy for me."}
{"text":"Decent poke spot but the portions are not worth the price. Lots of topping choices, flavors are solid, but when you are spending $15-17 without tax for a bowl it better be filled to the brim. Some of the flavor combos/toppings are a bit strange. Also tried their sushi burrito which is basically a big sushi roll. Would be more interesting if they used different paper rolls like spots in LA where there are some great sushi burrito trucks. The portions at Calii Love are better, tastes good as well, and about the same price."}
{"text":"Unbelievably overpriced and rather disgusting pre-made bowls...tastes awful. So many better poke places."}
{"text":"This is a fairly average place. Upon entering, the owner (I assume) greeted me with a warm welcome. The service is really great here. I really enjoyed the modern feel of the restaurant. The servers were really nice too.

My biggest complaint was that I was not told about the daily specials today. I purchased the build your own bowl and it was really expensive. $14 is a lot of money. I think $10-11 would've been more acceptable. I don't think they are purposely trying to get more money off me that particular moment, but I'm going to be careful next time.

The food was good, not mind blowing amazing to warrant 4 stars. The toppings were good. I enjoyed sauces and number of rounds to finish off your poke bowl. I might come back... Hopefully their prices don't stay this high."}
{"text":"Don't ever order from this place off uber eats. Its a rip off. They do not know how to do poke! I'm sorry if I wanted a cheap fast food salad, I would have bought a salad bowl from Harvey's or Wendy's that would be better quality, and more food for half the price. Would not recommend to anyone. You want good poke in the city? Check out ono poke bar."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for poké in toronto! Super inviting space, and lots of food options at a pretty good place. The staff is also very nice and inviting. The food is really good and I would highly recommend if your looking for some good poké"}
{"text":"This is absolutely delicious :) I love the squishy sushi rice, the flavorful lime sauce and the kikurage. The bowl is topped with crunchy taro and all the ingredients are very fresh, healthy and delicious!"}
{"text":"While exploring Toronto for the weekend, I came across Pokito after a day of shopping on Queen street. Cute, casual spot for a quick poke bite! The employee was great for recommendations. I went with the 4-20 as a main protein- glad I listened! It was delicious. All ingredients were fresh. You can also add a few of your own toppings on the side."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is Awesome. If this review was based on the food. You would have 5 stars. My problem is with the consistency. You can see who cares and who doesn't. I would eat here everyday if it was more consistent. I shouldn't have to look through the window to see who is working to decide if I want to go in. Don't get me wrong. The service is great. Everyone is very friendly
Im looking at who is rolling the burritos.
You need to put the right people in that place or train them better. Its an important role in your spot. Almost like a bartender or sushi chef.

The Sushi Burrito is like an art. You need to give it a little care and effort. If you are selling a sushi burrito, make sure its a perfect roll every time! Because it SUCKS when you get home, put on your show open up the burrito and it splits in half... 
And you end up eating it with a fork.
Just saying..."}
{"text":"Tons of new poke places are popping up left and right. I'm a fan of the food here but the prices are a bit more than other spots.  Not much else to say because I don't want my poke reviews to be copy and paste :)"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times simply because of its convenient location and the service is fairly fast to pick up lunch (wayyyy better than mcdonalds around the corner). I usually get the 420 or citrus blaze both with tuna and salmon. I've also gotten the scallop one which now seems to be off the menu. There's a good variety of toppings and my fav is the pineapple chow and I love the brown rice option. I personally feel like theres a good amount of toppings to rice.

The staff is nice and accommodating when ordering and the first time I went explained the ordering process. Always seems to be seats but they need to crank up their heating a bit in the winter, I always feel cold in there. 

The portions are large, and its really filling but yes the price is steep at least $15 for a bowl for a fast serve type restaurant, but you are getting good fresh tasting fish and lots of toppings. I havent been to any other poke restaurant so I might be biased. I've also ordered from them through uber eats, the bowl held up well from the travel but the rice did warm up the fish a bit but still good."}
{"text":"First time at a poke place, have to say the best thing about it is the service. The four stars are just plainly for that, the guys are awesome and super sweet! The food on the other hand...everything tastes good except for the fish and the guacamole. The guac tastes super processed like those packaged ones you buy in the supermarket. The fish isn't very fresh and has a weird texture. I got the signature 420 bowl (tuna & salmon) so I enjoyed the brown rice, crab salad, tamago and crunchy toppings. I'm not sure if I would return again yet!"}

Service: 7/10
Value: 8/10
Hygiene: 9/10
Aesthetics: 9.5/10

I must admit I had really high expectations of this place, so I feel my review may be a little biased. The sushi burrito I ordered had tuna, salmon, scallops, tamago, hawaiian guacamole, pineapple chow, gochuchang mayo, avocado wasabi cream, taro chips, fried onions, dried seaweed, cucumber, and tobiko. They added lettuce, cabbage, and imitation crab.

The ingredients were unique and they were really tasty. The pineapple was especially tasty. However, I did not expect the additional items and they really threw off the flavours of the burrito overall. 

The cost is around $15 for a salad, bowl, or burrito.

The service was very friendly, but they had to ask several times about what I asked for, despite having the order in front of them.

I enjoyed the dining room and thought it was quite cute. It's very spacious and there is plenty of seats. 

My companion had a poké bowl and it was much tastier than the burrito, because it didn't have the additional ingredients.

I think it is a decent place, but definitely needs a bit of refining."}
{"text":"I recently wrote a review for The Big Tuna Poke Bar and this place takes the cake, hands down. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My bowl looked really ugly but tastes great, got the spicy salmon..would ask for less mayo in it next time because ..too much mayo and extra calories. The bowl is very filling though, hard to eat in one sitting but can't save raw fish so nom nom nom quickly"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place really bad. It was actually the first sushi burrito place I saw when I yelp. Unfortunately with the pricing and the amount of fish they actually put on the burrito, that's part of why I didn't give them more stars. Unlike the other places, they weigh the fish they'll put in your food. In my case it was 5 cubes of salmon (after a couple of bites it's pretty mucj gone). For some reason mine tasted really fishy and strange and after having this type of dish around the city, I know that's not what it's supposed to taste like. I wasn't the only one who had this opinion as the person I was wish didn't like theirs either. Visually, it's pretty. But taste wise, it wasn't worth two burritos for over 30 dollars."}
{"text":"Pokito has one of the best poke that I've ever had. Ordered the Classic Salmon bowl with mixed greens instead of rice for a lighter choice and it was yummy. The service was also really good, the person who worked the cash was really helpful. Since it was my first time there, he explained the menu and helped me decide on what to order. The atmosphere was pretty casual - a good place to grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious sushi burrito. I recommend getting the special so worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for an early lunch, but when I arrived at 11:10 the doors were still locked and the chairs were still up. They only had two people working and it seemed like they were behind. After 5 minutes of waiting, they finally decided to open the doors.

Food was made quickly and the ingredients were fresh (crab salad wasn't very good). But overall the poke is below average. 

There are definitely many other options to get a better poke bowl."}
{"text":"Edit: they forgot to put avocado (which I paid extra) for the THIRD time.  

The only problem I have is that when I order avocado they forget to put it (which I then have to remind them at the times I do catch this). Unacceptable imo since I'm charged an extra $1.50.  otherwise, it's good"}
{"text":"This poke bowl/sushi burrito place is just okay. Nothing really sets them apart from other poke places. Food is great here but I found it to be a bit more pricier than other places. I had the creamy spicy salmon and it was delicious with the crispy onion they added on there. I like how they had a little additional condiments that you could add to your food. I was abit disappointed at how little salmon was in the actual burrito though. If I'm ever craving a poke bowl, probably wouldn't come here again since there are other places elsewhere that offer more bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Went back to Pokito as I had a hankering for a sushi burrito.    I got the classic tuna this time, with pineapple slaw, and seaweed salad with all the free toppings.   It was a much better experience .  The sushi burrito was rolled much tighter, the sushi rice is not as al dente as the first time.  I noticed that they weigh the meat portions so it's consistent, and only marinate the fish when you order so the fish isn't overly marinated .   

Definitely order a burrito if you are hungry as it offers much more food then a bowl .  Bowls cost $1 less then burritos though.    

I'm a little sad that guacamole costs extra because I love avocado in sushi....but overall it was a good experience and a nice healthy option to lunch."}
{"text":"With so many places popping up doing poke bowls, eventually one place may seem like another and you might not be sure what is which. Which, by the way, was my first impression of Pokito, one of the quickly-rising names in Toronto's edition of this food trend craze. The serving trays placemats with the write-your-name-here scheme bears a semblance to another poke shop nearby.

Yea tables! There are places to sit! Watch Queen West hipsters walk by! However, like many other poke places in town, they also fell into the sushi burrito trend hype. You can have anything either way, oh dear.

In terms of it as a poke place, Pokito comes across as a better experience. The guys were on a high friendly vibe, and quickly made me a Umeboshi Tofu bowl. The orange slices gives it a tasteful splash and some extra colour for that foodie shot you'd probably want out of it. They had a couple other things to eat, like a $5 special shrimp roti taco that wasn't much of anything.

The main annoyance I encountered was their menu boards didn't match their printed menus. 

[TTC: you can turf the 501 to Spadina]"}
{"text":"Ordered the 420 with tuna & salmon over UberEats and thought it was pretty mediocre. Hawaiian guacomole was strange, tasted sour and did not mix well with the sweet onions in place. Very small portion of fish and I thought that the ponzu sauce was too overpowering. My box came with 80% rice basically - was not very impressed."}
{"text":"Great Poke - I ordered from their classic menu (The 420) and the food was tasty. The fish (salmon and tuna) was fresh and even their brown rice was made to perfection. Would go again when I am back in the area - a bowl came to a total of $16.80 which is high for a meal but the ingredients were very fresh!"}
{"text":"I want to give Pokito 3.5 stars not just 3. I didn't know what to expect when I walked into the place. They have the usual build your own bowl or pre-made bowls. I went with the 420 bowl, which was their most popular bowl, it had both tuna and salmon, edamame beans, seaweed salad, corn, avocado and I also put avocado sauce, which as quite tasty. I got the regular size, which cost $16 including tax, which is not unusual for poke bowls. The nice thing about Pokito, is the toppings you can add, it's always a bonus when you can add your own toppings and add as much or little as you want. The flavours were quite tasty, but I am not quite sure if they give you enough salmon, tuna and other toppings that come with the bowl for the price that you pay. I would go back to try a different kind of bowl since the flavours were good, but wouldn't be the place I consistently go to. Also, they play the best way back play back songs! Loved that."}
{"text":"Came looking for the dole float but they just had the dole soft serve.  The other supplies weren't available.  cue sad face.

This is the second time I wanted to try this, the first time I called and was told the machine was broken.  Good thing I called to save a trip, but no dole float.  cue sad face.

Anyway, the guy made it for me and when I inquired if it was a dole float he said it wasn't.  I asked how much it was and he just let me try it and tell them what I think about it next time I go in.

The ice cream was almost like a sorbet, it wasn't creamy which is nice.  Can't wait to try the dole float next time.

Oh, and bonus points is that they have stamp cards when you buy a bowl!

Thank you Mr. Cashier!  You are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Quality and delicious healthy food. The 420 poke bowl is goood."}
{"text":"Aloha. Getting deja vu from all the poke places in TO. But here is another review. 

Tried the mix and match because I just like bespoke. So the base mix and match is $14. I added salmon, green papaya, edamame, pokito shoyu, pineapple chow, tamago, mandarin orange, nori, avocado wasabi sauce, taro chips, crispy onion, tobiko, and tuna for $2 extra. Total $16 before tax. It was a huge portion though. Lots of tuna and salmon.

Overall it tasted really fresh and I really like their shoyu and sushi rice. I for one an glad so many poke places have opened in the past year with good quality."}
{"text":"Great spot for poke bowls. Tried the 420 and it was great. They have daily specials that are a great deal too. Use the Yelp check in for 42% off your first 420 bowl."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to order poke last night and the only place on Uber Eats delivering to my neck of the woods was Pokito... did not enjoy my previous experience with Pokito, but she had a craving... 

The price to portion ratio is absurd. The $4 salmon maki roll at the neighbourhood sushi joint has more fish that the $14 \"burrito\" (aka hand roll...). 

I ordered the creamy spicy salmon burrito and after two bites into It, there was no more salmon to be found. It looked great when It arrived, but think they just put fish in the centre of the burrito and cut It on an angle to make it look like there is more fish than is actually present. 

I have Pokito a second chance, but unfortunately It just confirmed my first impression and previous review :/"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh Poke bowls. Also has great burritos. 

Great Service, really friendly atmosphere, you can tell all the staff care about this restaurant.

Tried the 420 Bowl, tuna, salmon, delish ponzu lime sauce, as well as hawaiian guac (which is a nice change from traditional guac). All the flavors complemented eachother, I added taro chips and crispy onions to mine.

Also had the Classic Tuna Burrito, it's the biggest burrito I've seen so far. It contains crab salad, Japanese mushrooms, this sweet ginger sauce, and a bunch of other stuff. I added Avocado wasabi to it, and it had a nice heat and cream to it. 

The place was clean and I like the design. I also like how they personalize your bowl by writing your name on it."}
{"text":"Great little poke shop on Queen St., perfect for stopping in for a bite while shopping! The store is bright, clean, and very welcoming. The staff are very friendly and knowledgable, which is great because you can create custom bowls and they're happy to help you with your choices.

My friend had the 420 bowl, and she loved it. I had the cajun shrimp sushi burrito. The flavours were bold, with just a hint of spice and so delicious. The burrito was so packed that it started falling apart after my first bite. I don't mind that, but be prepared for a bit of mess. There are also some toppings at the counter for you to add free of charge after they make your order too. They also have a daily special, so make sure to check that out when you go in."}
{"text":"I came in early afternoon for lunch. Not busy hour. There were 3 customers in front of me. Cashier can't print off proper receipt. The girl prep food is new. Can't catch the request \" No Onion\". gave out wrong order to wrong customer. I guess more training probably. Food is fresh, nothing wrong or exceptional. but too watery, like a lot of water left at bottom of the bowl."}
{"text":"I've had sushi burritos / poke bowls from all over, and I must say that Pokito has definitely mastered them!

A colleague and I decided to come in for lunch today (12:45pm) and waited about 20-25 minutes in line before finally getting our food. It was definitely worth the wait! The staff worked quickly and efficiently to make sure that they got the order right.

I ordered the Spicy Salmon sushi burrito without any extra toppings, and my colleague the Thai Coconut Shrimp poke bowl. Both were super fresh and filling! Personally, I would have appreciated a bit more rice in the burrito but it's not a deal breaker. The flavours and sauce were just right with the salmon, it was fresh and the chunks were generous in size.

Overall, I would definitely recommend trying this new joint out (maybe off peak hours since the wait can be quite overwhelming) and highly suggest if you're looking to try sushi burritos/poke bowls in Toronto that are as similar to those of the west coast, you should give Pokito a try!"}
{"text":"I went all out with my Pokito and maybe should had toned it back a bit. There was so much going on that I couldn't really taste the fish. Next time I will try a poke bowl instead. I really liked the cleanliness and the employees were great."}
{"text":"First time here! The staff was really helpful and detailed with everything on the menu. Love a place with so much passion for food. I made my own poke bowl and it was great! Adding spicy flakes to my bowl was the perfect tang to my taste buds. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty much a solid 3.5 stars. My friends and I came for the Grand Opening BOGO. It was surprisingly not as busy as expected which was great for us. The staff were friendly and the restaurant had a fresh and clean design. 

My friends and I ordered 420 Burrito, Spicy Salmon Bowl and Burrito and we kind of just made the bowls different so we could try different flavours. One bowl I did soba instead of rice which was nice and different. We also added random toppings like seaweed salad, pineapple, mushroom, corn etc. 

We felt the burrito was really good. Also huge, we could easily eat a half and be full. The bowl I saved for the next day and it was still good. I felt some of the fish pieces were a little big which is fine, I'm just used to the pieces chopped up a bit more. 

Overall the BOGO prompted me to vote this experience a 4/5 (since Yelp doesn't have half ratings) but I think if I went during a regular day it would be 3-3.5. Reason being, I felt the burrito and bowls + tax are almost $16-$17. That is insane for one meal in my honest opinion. It's nice that they have stamp cards too, but overall a bit too pricey for my taste."}
{"text":"I've never had a poke bowl before! I am now hooked! I loved their crab salad. It was great with the salmon and avocado. In a bit to be minutly healthy I asked for half the sushi rice (I hate salads). They graciously complied and I didn't feel like I missed out on anything. I was stuffed by the end of the meal! 

This place is worth a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and it's pretty different and interesting. I don't know if it's as tasty as another of the sushi burritos I've had else where and costs a little more. Although it might be a little bigger than some of the others. There is a fun amount of different toppings you can add, but I just don't think it's great value for a good that should be more grab and go? Worth trying if you are new to poke bowls or sushi burritos though!"}
{"text":"Confession:  I think the whole poke bowl trend is officially over for me.  So perhaps this review may reflect as such.

I was greeted and served by a very friendly, proactive gentleman.  If he's the manager, restaurant is in good hands because he reels indecisive browsers in!

Probably the better poke bowls that I have eaten.  I've been to 2-3 other places.  Portion was good, enough for about 1.5 servings, significantly more rice than fish, no real complaints there.  There was an addition of good, free toppings that added texture to the entire dish such as taro chips, toasted sesame seeds, etc., so that was appreciated.

I got a Spicy Salmon bowl with brown rice and taxes in it was $14+, so even though it's a cafeteria style, fast eatery, don't expect cheap prices!  I actually wanted a sushi burrito, but couldn't justify the +$1 for it.  (At my usual place, the sushi burrito is actually CHEAPER than a poke bowl.)  Yes, it's healthier than cheap Chinese food, but you have to keep the fact that you're paying for whole foods in mind.

What I didn't like, and Pokito is just 1 of many places that does this, is that even if you're eating in, they give you a throw-away bowl/cutlery.  So not very environmental in that aspect."}
{"text":"there's a lot of competition going on around downtown; and i gotta say i'm loving it! everyone's around the same price point; but doing it in their own different way (different sizing; toppings; fish quality) which is so cool;  they've all been great and tasty; relatively, i actually find this better then Su & Bu but not as good as Poke guys; just b/c of the customisation and variety;"}
{"text":"A bit on the expensive side but the food was delicious. We made our own bowls with tuna and salmon and the fish was very fresh. Would go again."}
{"text":"Visited this little spot on a Wednesday afternoon with a friend. It was a little busy but we were able to find a couple seats. 

Staff is super friendly; one gentleman even gave me a small sample of the chipotle mayo used on the Spicy Salmon poké bowl for me to gauge how spicy it was haha. 

I went with the 420 poké bowl which was a little pricey (~$16) but it was absolutely worth it! They gave you the option of choosing your own toppings and I went with the seaweed salad and mandarin oranges, topped with taro chips.

The interior is clean and the decor is cute and modern.

Overall I would recommend this place and will definitely stop by again in the future!"}
{"text":"Sorry I had to update my review  but opinions change. 


This isn't my first Poke place. The customer service here is still ridiculously nice. But have you ever felt ripped off before ? No? Well you're about to be going to this place. It's like the prices magically went up. Especially for a place I've come to on so many occasions. 

Anyways, I've noticed over time my portions have been getting smaller. Today in particular my bowl was basically empty for the $18 I paid and $3 tip. 
Taro chips aren't free anymore just a heads up. The employee making another persons bowl didn't even have gloves on and he was back staff. 
No offence to this business in any way but there are so many Poke places opening and I honestly refuse to spend my money on a bowl a 3 year old wouldn't be full from. 

Won't be returning sorry."}
{"text":"i'm not a poke expert, but what i ate from pokito was delicious. the best poke i've experienced in toronto so far. 

if i was a twenty year old, the standard portion would leave me hungry. however, those days are past and i found the 420 the perfect amount of food. there was a generous amount of fresh fish and other quality toppings. 

the service was fast and friendly. the place is big and clean. would definitely try again."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out this place with my buddy, my first poke bowl!
It's a casual ambiance here, I love the trendy renos and awesome music.
Food is made fresh, quick, and tastes awesome.
I got the bowl because I'm no good with burritos/wraps, they just get messy!
As you can see in the photos, my buddy got the burrito, and it was just funny watching him get messy eating that thing.

I ordered their classic 420 with extra salmon (or \"protein\" as they call it) with a touch of spicy mayo, but they definitely squeezed more than I wanted. Couldn't tell them to stop squeezing that bottle in time.  

Honestly, I absolutely loved it, it was fresh, and I just love salmon & avocados all in all.  However I give it 4 stars because it's quite expensive for a poke bowl, coming close to $20.  Trying it once was probably enough for me, I'd only come back if I'm crazy craving it out of the blue moon."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting. You can not create your own bowl as the website still says. You have to choose one of the signatures and remove/add what you don't like/like. And the attendant was not so happy about it. Also, they initially said they don't have non-marinated fish, but when I said I can't have oils (sesame oil for instance, usually used on the marinade), then he said he could get non-marinated in the back... But again, not very happy about it... 
Overall, just a disappointing experience. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's because I went to Haiwaii and had poke before so I keep comparing, but this was quite disappointing. Don't have your hopes up for authentic poke bowl, but be prepared for a more fusionized style.

I tried the 420 signature poke bowl ($14.95) which was diced tuna and salmon sashimi mixed in ponzu lime sauce, sweet onion, cucumber, and hawaiian guacamole. Expensive for what you get - if I were to spend that much I would expect to have more protein. There were only 3 pieces of tuna! One thing that bothered me was the fish was not marinated but mixed on the spot, so the flavor was not well absorbed. The ponzu lime sauce lacked flavor, I couldn't taste any of lime. Not so sure why they call it haiwaiian guacamole because it tasted like any normal guacamole. Overall the food was ok, but not worth the price.

Definitely would go to poke guys instead - their same size bowl is $10 and has way more ingredients."}
{"text":"Sad that they got rid of their daily specials- they included an extra \"bar\" item menu where you can add more items to their specials... but overall the prices have increased since their earlier days. Pretty bummed about that considering the price points were already quite high to begin with.

I used to be a  pretty frequent customer of this place considering it's one of the better spots for a poke bowl around my neighbourhood- ordered via Ritual a couple times as well as just a regular walk in. Not sure if it was just the different people that have made my order, but sometimes it's amazing and I'd be dying to order from them again. Sometimes I regret spending almost $18 on a lazy meal. I find they don't include too much fish even in their larger regular size and their bowls are not too saucy (I'm a fan of sauce). I found that my last visit was fairly mediocre- at this moment, not sure I'd be dying to come again like I used to."}
{"text":"I was in Canada for three months and this was my go-to place. It was my first time ever eating a Poke Bowl and also the best one.

Staff there is extremely friendly and although the place is small, it's still very cozy and nice. 

100% recommend."}
{"text":"Just been there one time, but the experience was nice and I'll be willing to return. 

I had the 420 bowl, the fish is fresh and cut into big pieces, which I like since you can really taste the fish. The mix of ingredient is nicely done, the choice of garlic brown rice is a good option which I've never seen before, and the extra free toppings is a nice finishing touch. Price-wise, it's in the range of every other poke bowls in the city, so it is acceptable to me. And like many places, you can custom your bowl, which is never a bad thing.
Another good point is the number of seats. It is not huge but there is a nice number of seats, which is not always the case.

All in all, very satisfied by this Poke experience!"}
{"text":"It was fun to try but I don't think I'll be coming back.

I had a spicy sushi burrito that had a lot going on. I love sushi and Japanese food in general but the pre-made suggested combinations seemed a little too westernized for my taste.

I know a lot of people love this place and again, it's fun. I get that.

I wouldn't go back on a frequent basis though. It's kind of like funnel cake. You can only justify having it once a year.

The kitchen is open so you can see what's going on and the rushed factory approach isn't producing the kind of flavours that I truly feel are possible.

This place has great potential but in my personal opinion, it's not there yet.

Their drink selection was pretty straight forward. Very Costco-ish/convenience store. There wasn't much thought put into their selection.

Aside from the food, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY??

Their poke bowls!! Feeling like a salad is boring and want something more fresh? Consider a poke bowl. I love the chopped raw salmon salad bowl and you get to mix it with toppings of your choice. I like my bowl to have fish roe, edamame beans, seaweed, corn and some veggies. Mmmmm so delicious. I thought the ingredients were very fresh and they were efficient with their service. 

LAST TIP??

Be adventurous and try different toppings or toppings you haven't tried before!! No matter what topping you put in your bowl, it generally is very good. :)"}
{"text":"I was very excited to see poke make it's way to Toronto after enjoying it for years in Hawaii and more recently in California. I chose Pokito for a late dinner simply because it's was still open and the reviews were good. I had the 420 bowl  (tuna and salmon). It's not authentic poke like in Hawaii but it was still very tasty. Unfortunately the portion is tiny. $15 for a little bowl that didn't fill me up is disappointing."}
{"text":"Pokito is a cute poké shop where you build your bowl, like Chipotle. The guy could tell we were new & helped us out, even for our friends who were new to poké he gave good recommendations for what toppings to choose. The portion was a bit on the small size, bc I felt if I was a bit hungrier I would've ordered the bowl & the burrito. But nevertheless, super good, awesome flow"}
{"text":"Summary: Another poke bowl place in Toronto. Good quality, good service, pricy and small portion.

All of sudden, Toronto has many poke bowl places opened up. I ordered a poke bowl through the Ritual app. It is a small portion for $15 meal. The ingredients are fresh. It is a good quality poke bowl, but I found it pricy and small portion.
The service was good. I would not go back for lunch again because of the price.

Recommend: only if you want to try out poke bowl"}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy salmon Hawaiian poke. Taste was decent. For almost $15 after tax I expect a lot more food. The container seemed big but wasn't that full.

Would go back if the portion increased by 50%."}
{"text":"Standard poke place, can't think of anything that really makes it stand out but there are a lot of options for toppings and they give you a fair amount of content."}
{"text":"Pokito is my favourite thing in the world. I guess I'm a little biased because it's the first and only poke I've tried, but in all honesty, It's all I needed.

The bowls can amount to about 15 bucks but it's honestly all worth it. They do not skimp on the fish or ingredients at all. I also love the fact that you can get either rice, noodles, or GREENS! For us health nuts out there :)

The staff are always super friendly and helpful when it comes to the menu and making suggestions so don't be shy!!!

Oh my god if I was rich I would honestly eat here everyday."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place ever since it first opened! As one of the first poke places to come to Toronto I had high expectations, especially since sampling a couple of different places in the area. I ordered their signature bowl, the 420, since it had salmon and tuna (yum). I was then given the choice of including a few extra toppings as well, I went with my usual: seaweed salad and edamame. 

Upon first glance, I was really impressed with the amount of food they were able to pack into a single bowl (about the same as Poke Guys) and how they included kale as well instead of the usual mixed greens but the price! After tip, my bowl was $18 which makes it the most expensive poke bowl I've ever ordered to date. 

Sadly, I had to wait until I got back to work until I could sample some of it so the fish, while still fresh, was more on the soggy side. The ponzu lime sauce gave it a refreshing taste though. The rice was a bit too al dente for my taste but all in all, it was quite filling and I was only able to finish about half of it. 

Pokito has daily specials as well for $12 so I will go back to try some of their other bowls when I'm in the area. The Thai Coco Shrimp sounds delicious."}
{"text":"One of the best Poke bowls I have had in Toronto. I have had a few in New York, and this one is one of my favourites. Love the fact you can put more toppings on after they make it, the spicy topping makes it taste oh so much better. Will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Overall I'm a fan of Pokito. I've been to Hawaii many times and loveee poke so the whole 'build your bowl' movement is a little weird to me (it's not a sub!). Anyway, the flavours here are good and you have a ton of options. Literally took me 10 minutes to order because there are a bajillion options with every bowl. The price is reasonable and the goods (fish/topping) to filler (rice/salad) ratio is good!"}

Cool spot and part of the new Poke craze.  We had a tuna Rice bowl and a Tuna Salad bowl.  

Overall good bowl... A little light on the fish proportions.  If in the area give then a try!"}
