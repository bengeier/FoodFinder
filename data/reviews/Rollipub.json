{"text":"Not only does this place have beautiful, carefully selected decor, but it makes a mean sushitto. The full sushi-burrito hybrid is massive (I like to take half of it home to eat later). Lunch specials are also good value (half a freshly made sushitto with miso soup for 10 bucks is pretty decent these days). You can tell the owners have their hearts in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here back in December, the second week that Rollipub was open, I believe.

We ordered several items at the time:

Two sushittos: Bulgogi and Salmon
Lobster tails
Kimchi Poutine

All of the food was great. We could've done without the lobster tails and shared 1 sushitto as they are extremely filling!

Because it was opening week, and one of the main chefs was out due to an injury, the service of the food was a tad slower than usual, but nothing that was too out of hand.

One comment I have to make, was to the group of 10 people, who ordered several poutines and sushittos, and ended up leaving after 30 minutes of waiting, deeming it was too long to wait for food. I think they left without paying too. That's just not right. especially since you were forewarned of the understaff for the day.

Definitely make it out to Rollipub, I've since heard the chef is back in business and if you like your sushittos off a truck, you'll sure as heck like all their other hot foods!

:) Will return again!"}
{"text":"If this can be rated half a star, I will.  If you came to just eat a sushi burrito, I would look for the food truck only.

We came into this restaurant because our party all loved the sushi burrito from the truck. On a Saturday night, this place only had 2 tables. We were the third table to occupy this space. 

We gave our order to the waitress, she had difficulty pronouncing menu items. It's ok, Japanese is not her native tongue.

We ordered a bulgogi in the appetizer menu, she came out with a bulgogi burrito. We asked to confirm the item on the menu, she said theres no such thing, only in sushi burrito format. That was fine, I understand.

We ordered cooked items that were shareable but when the food came, there were no utensils. We had to ask for plates and utensils. As we sat to digest some of the food, the waitress came to try to take away our plates. She took our plates and utensils when there were still food on the table for consumption.

In general, the food was ok in the restaurant. Not mind blowing, but it fills the tummy. The star deductions were mainly for the service we received. 

We got the bill quickly after our meal. As most general customers, you would utilize the washroom before you leave the premise. My party went to the washroom downstairs, and the waitress asked if I can take their belongings and leave the restaurant because a party will be coming and required the table.  Keep in mind at this time, there were only 2 tables being occupied in this restaurant, a place that has 15 tables.  The waitress would like me to hold all my parties` belonging and stand outside in the cold so they can have the table for the reserved party, which obviously there were many other empty tables available. I do not believe this is what customer service should be like.   

To top it off, the waitress asked how the meal was so I gave a response that it was good.  Her response was not warm at all. Our party can now see why the restaurant was busy with only 2 tables of guests, instead of filled like the other ones.

Do yourself a favour and don't go in. Save your money, and the attitude"}
{"text":"The space is very relaxed, dim lighting with videos and cool decor. 
The food I ordered was the classic Susshito. It was massive! the fish was fresh, the crispy bits were balanced, and the rice was just the right texture. I want to go back with the kids in order to taste the other hot food items on the menu. 
Unfortunately, I have found they are closed some nights when I want to get take out. The atmosphere can be a little slow, as the times I was there, there weren't a lot of patrons. service was friendly, and nice."}
{"text":"After following the @Sushittontheroad on instagram, I was so excited to try this place out and I'm glad that I did. This little charm will want you coming back for more and here's why: 

The place was nicely decorated and clean! Which gave it a comfortable setting to enjoy their delicious food. 

The waitress (as written before in other reviews) really knows what she's talking about when it comes to the menu, she is also kind and polite and make sure things are good time to time. A waitress that shows enthusiasm about the menu is the way to go. Good job :) 

The food is ABSOLUTELY delicious and some of the stuff that they have on there is probably not found in any other Japanese restaurant. For ex... sushi tacos with tempera seaweed taco shell ... where else do you find that? Or sashimi nachos? Yeah my point exactly. The food is unique and sure is delicious. 

This place easily gets a 5 stars with out a doubt."}
{"text":"I  just had an amazing Salmon steak lunch special. The ambience was great. Salmon cooked to perfection - crispy outside; melting and juicy inside. It came with Miso soup - it was a bit cold but was tasty."}
{"text":"This was the second time I came here and was disappointed. After I didn't love the roll I ordered the first time I decided to give it another try. This time it was actually worse! The roll that came was different from what was on the menu - it had mango in it, which I never would have ordered - and when I pointed it out the waitress explained that they'd changed their recipe but not the menu. Which makes zero sense to me. They made me a new roll without mango which was very nice. But then the waitress basically abandoned me. I sat at the table for at least ten minutes waiting to ask for my bill while she texted behind the bar. Seriously not cool. I won't come back here again. Food and service is bad, and the music is absolutely terrible. Bad."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Cheap beers. Nice venue. Would go back for food. Overall nice bar to hang out in the summer afternoon."}
{"text":"It was good but not mind blowing! Great first experience for sushi burrito and they have non-raw options for those who are squeamish. 

Their spicy salmon burrito was well done and not loaded with mayo but it tasted like an average roll."}
