{"text":"Clean, quick, friendly,  and the food was good. My husband and I have never been here before, but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very very over priced... We got three chicken and steak dinners and it was a portion for kids I mentioned it and they said it was because we didn't get any vegetables.Just terrible and the food was just okay but we will never ever go back! When we came in the cook was sitting down looking at tv!"}
{"text":"I am a fan and will be back!   Since, I moved here from California I've been to five sushi places. Mai Japanese Sushi Restaurant has been \"BY FAR\" the best. I've been eating sushi since I was a little girl so I admit I know my stuff. I've been to Japan and I've tried just about everything. Still to this day nothing will beat Sagami Sushi in Collingswood, New Jersey --- but that my friends, is for another story.   What brought me to Mai Sushi was a restaurant.com gift card from my good friend. She said it is her favorite place here in the Charlotte area and wanted to be sure that we got there at some point. After months of having this piece of paper I decided it was time to use it. Thank goodness for that!  Mai Sushi is tucked away in a shopping center right off of Rea Road. The restaurant is quiet, clean and not too overwhelmingly large. There is a sushi bar if you choose to sit and watch the sushi chef practice his culinary skills, and there are booths and tables galore if you'd rather focus on the company you came with.  We choose to sit in a quiet booth very close to the sushi bar so we could still take in all the action. We were waited on by an incredibly friendly waiter named Phat (pronounced Fat) who made the experience a truly special one. He let us take our time and explore the menu and also suggested his favorites. I always appreciate it when a waiter gives that extra personal touch to make you feel like you're family.   We decided to go all out since we had this extra 25-dollars rewarded to us, from our friend, over the holidays. My goal for this restaurant was to check out the sushi and if it was great make sure to come back and order the Chirashi the next time. Chirashi is an assortment of sashimi (just fish) perfectly cut and placed over a bed of slightly warm vinegared rice. That's what I'm getting next time. As for my most recent experience ...  Here's what we ordered:  Edamame: which are boiled soybeans in their pods and then lightly salted and served in a bowl. (they were delish and honestly if they weren't we would have known we were in deep trouble. It's very hard to mess up edamame)  Agedashi: YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!!!! This is 4 pieces of lightly deep fried tofu in a lighter form of a tempura based batter. The tofu is stacked beautifully in a bowl and garnished with a clear brown mushroom sauce. THIS WAS SO GOOD ... I FORGOT TO TAKE A PICTURE OF IT! Mmmm the sauce is clear and delicate. It's the same color as a ponzu sauce but tastes totally different. It's was amazing!  We also both got miso soup which was perfectly salty and just the right temperature.  For dinner we choose to get mainly an assortment of the cleaner sushi rolls ... meaning the non-fancy ones. Here's the dinner order.  (2) Tuna rolls (I requested for them to be made in the traditional style with the nori/seaweed on the outside) ---- These were perfect. They tasted clean, the tuna was a deep burgundy color and it melted in your mouth.   (1) Yellowtale roll (I requested it to be made with scallions) --- The fish was very fresh and the perfect light pink to a light tan color. It tasted just right and sat perfectly in our bellies.  (1) Vegetable roll (this is made with the nori on the outside and has cucumber, lettuce, asparagus, avacado, carrot and sesame seeds on the inside as well as the rice) --- This was nice and fun for a change. It was made just as I would have visually imagined it from the description. And with that said, I probably won't get it again since it didn't give my mouth the refreshingly earthy punch I was expecting. Good ... but not exciting enough for me.  (1) Rainbow Roll (this is a California roll topped with various fish like salmon, tuna, yellowtail, cooked shrimp and a few others) --- This was really good and very filling. The presentation of it was pretty and it settled perfectly in my belly. Yum, yum, yum.  (1) Sake/Salmon Sashimi (this is three pieces of just the fish perfectly cut and placed over a bed of string carrot garnish) Mmmm ... this was good and tasted as fresh as fish can be in Charlotte, North Carolina. I saved this for last bite and I am happy I did. The salmon tasted clean, fresh and buttery. It was very easy to bite through and was a perfect last bite choice before moving onto dessert.   YES, WE GOT DESSSERT TOO! I know I said we were going all out so we shared a scoop of Green Tea Ice-Cream. YUM! I love the grittiness of green tea ice-cream. It has the perfect sweetness without distracting from the green tea flavor. LOVE IT!  To drink we sipped on hot tea throughout the meal. All in all, our experience was superb!   I only gave Mai \"four out of five\" stars because I haven't seen it's full potential yet. So it didn't wow me to a standing ovation. Hopefully, once I am back and order the Chirashi dinner I will be able to change my four stars to five.   This love affair at Mai Sushi is not over. We will be back! Thanks Phat for making the experience so wonderful"}
{"text":"I  noticed Mai on a recent trip to the Harris Teeter at the shopping center at Colony and Rea Road.  I live in Ballantyne and thought I would give this a try, since it is close to home.  I am always looking for new neighborhood places.  I asked a good friend and fellow sushi lover to meet me for dinner.  We both found the place cozy and were greeted when we walked in the door.  The staff was friendly,  the service a bit slow.  Mai has specials every night.  Monday was specials on domestics, and Tuesdays are half-price wine by the glass.  Kids under a certain age eat free during the week.  Mai also offers complimentary California Rolls or Edamame while you wait.  What a great touch.  We ordered edemame and found it quite nice.   The menu was quite varied.  As well as sushi, included hibachi and tempura,  Udan and Bento Boxes, etc.   My friend found the sushi menu included several tempura rolls that her kids would love.  I had a difficult time choosing an appitizer from the selection.    We ate Gyoza, Spider Roll, Tempoura Roll and Shrimp Shumai.  My friend's oldest daughter ended up joining us later and had the tempura California roll and part of our dinner.  We all enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere.    I would definitely return to try out more from the menu and enjoy the atmosphere.  It was interesting to note that there were several Japanese people that came in while we were there.  My friend wants to bring all four of her children and husband back too, since they are sushi lovers and the location is so convenient.  I would definitely recommend you try out Mai at least once if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This is a pretty nondescript little sushi spot stuck on in a suburban strip mall.  As others have noted, this isn't a hopping scene by any means.  But if you want consistently good sushi, you can do much worse than this in Charlotte.  Service is almost always a bit slow, but there is no doubting the friendliness of everyone who works here.  If you have kids and love to eat sushi (especially if you have kids WHO love to eat sushi), this is a good standby."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! Ordered the surf and turf. It was delicious and cooked to my specifications."}
{"text":"I had the Katsu Don last Friday and The chicken was so tough that I could not bite it.  They need to find a better vendor for their  raw materials."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great prices and great food! The service is great and the chef is very knowledgeable and accommodating."}
{"text":"Very solid neighborhood sushi place. We always get take-out and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is hidden back in the food lion shopping center off Harris Blvd. in the university area. It was a great find as they have a more Japanese fusion type menu with sushi and traditional American Japanese favorites. The food was fresh, the staff was friendly and quick, was a great experience. I will go back to this restaurant and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Nice miso based ramen soup.  Egg noodles, onions, grilled chicken, bamboo shoots and a hearty miso base.  Place is better known for its hibachi and sushi/maki, but I enjoyed the straight-forward miso ramen."}
{"text":"Went for sushi and waited 45 minutes when there was hardly anyone in the restaurant (there were quite a few take out orders) before asking the waiter where our food was.  We were told that our order would be up shortly. Asked again when our food would come.  There was no acknowledgement or apology from the staff regarding the latest of our order.  Finally asked for it to go.  Got home and the sushi was mediocre at best.  No flavor, mushy over ripened avocado, even the rice wasn't good. We won't be eating sushi there ever again!  Sorry to say, Harris Teeter sushi is better than Mai."}
{"text":"place was dead compared to the Lodge 2 doors down.  We were one of 2 couples there.  Miso soup was really salty - my fiance's hibachi chicken was dry.  tempura is par and hibachi steak cooked to order, although not much on the plate, compared to the chicken, which was probably a large breast.    So you get a large plate of dry chicken and a small plate of good steak.  My dish was $25, for a $12-15 plate.  Thank God I had my restaurant.com coupon so I paid half price!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place several times and the food is pretty good. I think the prices are kinda on the high side considering the portion size. The staff is friendly and inside is very clean. Food was prepared quickly. My favorite is the hibachi chicken and shrimp platter. It was $13-14 at lunch time."}
{"text":"Keeping it simple and being successful at it. One chef to another, keep it going. If the food and service stays consistent, I can see this place being around for a while."}
{"text":"Craving for hibachi so we decided to try Mai for takeout.  Service was friendly and fast.    Glad that I requested siracha sauce or else there would not have been flavor, well except for the tiny serving of carrots.  The fried rice was lackluster and dry.  I still want hibachi.  Likely will not return."}
{"text":"So far, the sushi I've had at Mai Japanese has been the best in Charlotte. I'm extremely picky when it comes to my sushi, and I'm glad they make it fresh right in front of you. The sushi chef is very knowledgeable and knows what he's doing, which is a plus. Tonight will be the third time I've gotten their take out, and I've been impressed all three times.  Their staff is always friendly, and they're always quick to bring your meal. I definitely recommend this restaurant! :-)"}
{"text":"Okay. My husband and I went here because we found it on restaurants.com. It is located in a busy shopping area and draws in a crowd.   The sushi chefs were friendly and greeted us the moment we walked in the door. The atmosphere was good. The staff were fast and my glass was never empty. However, the food was unremarkable. Meh. I've experienced better.  I'm glad that we used a gift certificate because I would not have been happy to pay the full price. It's not that it wasn't a good place; I think many people enjoy it since it seemed pretty busy. It just didn't impress me enough to want to go back."}
{"text":"Thought I had reviewed Mai but apparently not.  A very fine Japanese that happens to have sushi rather than the reverse.  Nice selection and even my non seafood eating wife can find good choices on their menu.  Fresh, neatly presented, perfectly cooked everything.  Having lived in Japan for a few years I am burned out on soya sauce flavor, so am not as whoopie as most reviewers.  That said, Mai does it well...Genki des and diajobu.  All OK.  Service is genuine and the sushi masters usually greet whomever walks in the door, serving to alert the wait staff to latch on to new eaters.  Fun for groups and there are usually a number there.  In the Harris Teeter shopping center off Rae Road.  An excellent shopping center for food, so Mai fits right in.  Even if you are a little scared of Japanese food, Mai is the place to safely break the ice.  Sample everything served and they accept that not everyone likes everything, but to not even try is very insulting."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I have not been disappointed once. Very friendly staff, clean and new location. Very good hibachi steak and shrimp. The sushi is very tasty."}
{"text":"SUPER yummy!!! The fish was very fresh... Plating quite beautiful... LOTS of options! Staff was ok... Not very helpful though. Clean facilities."}
{"text":"This is a great value for some delicious Japanese food.  We ordered a variety of appetizers (all were delicious) - edamame, pork dumplings, onion soup, ginger dressing salad.  I had the steak entree which was really delicious...similar to what you would get in hibachi restaurant with veggies and rice.   The interior is small and not too fancy, but the prices are great!  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Really a nice place to go to in Charlotte for a cozy atmosphere, friendly people, and delicious food with good portions. Ignore the number of customers and walk in to a wonderful meal. They just had a change in owners the last year so this may account for some of the wide difference of opinion. Complimentary sushi was wonderful. Great food, nice place. Will go back soon!  I did not give it a five star since it would benefit from more Japanese decor to set the mood."}
{"text":"Looks like this place maybe under new management?  Just awful. Sushi tastes like salt and mayonnaise. Fried rice was inedible. The whole Togo order smelled like McDonald's. I'm out."}
{"text":"It was just okay.  We've been to numerous Sushi restaurants in Charlotte, Davidson & Asheville, and this was probably our least favorite out of all of them.  It wasn't \"bad\"..just very boring.  We have another restaurant.com coupon from the Ayrsley restaurant so maybe that will be better."}
{"text":"My wife and I were greeted with a smile by Lin and seated right away around 7pm. It was only another couple seated. Both bathrooms were extremely clean, fresh, and smelled really nice. The decor is nice. The dragon roll and the nigiri was very good. Lin was an awesome waitress, attentive and courteous. We will defiantly return for more sushi. Would recommend you try for sushi."}
{"text":"Yoshi at Mai (pronounced Mi) is an artist. Sushi is always good, always consistent, always presented well. A real plus is that they have live music on Tuesday nights."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the bf. He ordered the chicken hibachi, I ordered the steak hibachi with noodles and we shared a shrimp tempura roll. Food was just okay. Not bad but not amazing.  I saw they have pretty good sushi lunch specials maybe worth it. But if you are a sushi and/or hibachi lover I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I (with my obsessive direction) have made it a point to try out all of the various sushi places in her city and mine.  This time, instead of gong somewhere we had been before, we decided to go here.  Overall, the experience was great, and I believe we will be going back pretty soon.  I only wonder why we seemed to be the only people interested in the place, as we were the only party in there until right when we were about to leave, when another party walked in.  Let me start off by saying that we are vegetarians, so the vegetable tempura and various vegetarian rolls were what we ordered.  Thus, I cannot comment on much of the menu, but I have a lot to say about the place.  We were immediately greeted by a server, who showed us to a table and was immediately also ready to take our order.  This is certainly not a bad thing, as we have been in sushi restaurants before where service was questionable (as in, it was questionable if we still had a server).  Since the place was empty, once we had our order ready, getting her back was no ordeal at all.  Thus, there cannot be much wrong with a place that is slow, as long as the food is great, because then the service can really become whatever you want it to be.  I will say that the sauce for the vegetable tempura was questionable as to whether or not it was vegetarian, but we sat it aside and dug in.  The tempura was great-tasting, perfectly cooked, and one thing that I appreciated was the size of the pieces.  Some places you go, you get the huge pieces of vegetables that look like they have been thrown together with no regard.  Do not get me wrong, I love a lot of food, but I also love food that is easy to consume (so that I can handle the large portion, of course).  This place's vegetable tempura was some of, if not the, best.  We ordered a few vegetarian rolls and all of them came out with no problems at all, all looking fresh and wonderfully prepared.  The server had no trouble adding ingredients to our rolls as we wished, and it made for a great meal.  They implement a tablet when you are paying, so that there is that level of efficiency that cannot be beat (as well as giving the option to forgo paper receipts that can pile up from one order alone)."}
{"text":"Our favorite! We are über regular here and introduce friends every chance we get. I have been to several of the \"marquee\" sushi restaurants in Charlotte, always in search of the best sushi spot. I have to say, Mai never disappoints. I need to mention, I am a purist. I don't like fried sushi, anything laden with that weird pink mayo or any of the trendy stuff. I order sashimi and like it fresh and unadulterated. And in my opinion, Mai is the best sushi and best deal in Charlotte. We never have to wait for a table, ALWAYS receive excellent service, and the food is consistent and delicious. I always order sashimi or sushi along with edamame and a salad. My husband and son love their ramen noodles. I mean, they obsess about their ramen noodles. Mai's ramen is their gold standard.   If you are a fan of Japanese food, Mai will not let you down (in Charlotte). Tell them I sent ya! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Friendly fast service! I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the edamame app with the spicy salmon roll and the dynamite roll. The edamame was decent, the spicy salmon roll was pretty large considering the price, & the dynamite roll needed more flavor (both rolls were pretty flavorless). I wish the spicy mayo was spicy as it tasted more like regular mayo... The server/hostess, Lee, appeared to be very distracted, disconnected and was not personable. I'll keep looking for my go to sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I won't be eating here any time soon. I tried Mai for the first time, getting takeout hibachi. Having reviewed the menu, I saw that mixed vegetables come with the meal. I asked if I could have the mixed vegetables without the onions. \"No, they are already mixed together.\" Ummmkay..... Then she tells me \"If you'd like to substitute it for broccoli or zucchini, we can do that.\" Seeing as how I like both of those, I ask to have broccoli and zucchini. Response \"No, you're not getting it. You can't have both. You have to choose one.\" -_- I felt her response was condescending. I'm not an idiot. I understood what she was saying, just didn't think it would be such a burden to put a 1/2 portion of broccoli and a 1/2 portion of zucchini. I finally gave up and chose broccoli.   After all of that, I picked up my food. When I got home, I was disappointed that it simply wasn't very good. The shrimp had the tails. The rice had zero flavor. It was like egg flavored fried rice. No salts, spices, nothing. It just wasn't good. I wouldn't go back there or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"What a true disappointment. First, the waiter was very rude & with no one else in the restaurant it wasn't like he was busy! I started with the miso soup & ginger salad. The soup was ok, hot is the only good thing I can say. Although the ginger dressing was good, it was so watery that the lettuce was drenched. After for the sushi, so disappointing. The salmon nigiri was decent, as for the tuna roll, ugh! It tasted very fishy & I was unable to eat it. When I was asked if I wanted it wrapped I expressed the fact that it was bad, and was left ignored. I received the bill, $22.00, for lunch, huh? The two bills for price is so wrong. A little pricey for lunch! Will not return!"}
{"text":"The place was dead at noon, never a good sign.  I ordered the philly and spicy tuna rolls, and whilst I dined, I thought it was pretty good.    However, it's now about 2 hours after lunch and I'm hurtin... all sorts of gross stomach issues I won't share, but let's just say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place located right beside the Food Lion so it's convenient if you just want to pick up something quick. I called ahead of time place my order and my food was promptly ready and waiting for me (seriously, it was placed on the counter as I was walking towards the door). The young lady that took my order was very helpful, since this place was new to me.   The food was good! If only I were able to get a full plate. The sweet carrots were good enough to pass as yams, with your eyes closed... But I literally only had 5 carrot slices on my plate. Also, the chicken pieces appeared to equate less than 6oz, which is the size plate I ordered. I may try this place again, but I may a little hesitant due to salmon and steak having a $3 difference in cost but being offered at the same 6oz serving. But I will not know until I try, right?"}
