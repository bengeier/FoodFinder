{"text":"I went to Chicago Gyros with my husband, brother, and sister tonight based solely on the reviews on Yelp. I am happy to say that this place rocks!

One awesome thing is that they offer \"normal food\" (sister's description) such as burgers, hot dogs, fish and chips, and chicken strips as well as Mediterranean food. 

We got the Vegetarian Platter (appetizer) so the youngins could try something Mediterranean without committing to a full meal that they were convinced they wouldn't like. The Platter includes two different types of hummus, pita bread, dolmas, and falafel. Everyone tried the hummus and agreed it was \"ok\" or \"I've had better\" (me)... the pita bread was loved by all. The dolmas were scorned by the kids since they were - gasp! - green and slimy-looking. The husband and I tried them - we didn't love them, but we would try them again. The falafel were determined to be just okay - they were a little on the greasy side and I'm not sure if that is how they are supposed to be...?

Husband and I got the Chicago Gyros. This is were this restaurant goes from two stars (more on that below) to four and a half stars. The meat was perfectly seasoned, moist, the pita was the perfect texture, and the sauce was delicious. Perfection when eaten with the meat and pita. I have eaten a LOT of gyros and this is one the best Tzatziki sauce I've ever had.

The service. The guy behind the counter earned the nickname from my group of Mr. No Personality / Mr. No Smile. Seriously, he NEVER smiled. I cracked jokes, I complimented the gyros, I didn't even get a twitch of a smile or acknowledgment that I had spoken. The cook, on the other hand, smiled and thanked me while Mr. NP/NS continued to ignore me. Whatever - the perfection that is their gyro is almost enough to make up for him... he keeps them from a perfect score, so the final score is: 4-1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Came in tonight after reading the previous reviews. I had the falafel pita and greek fries. The food came out relatively quickly (there were two orders ahead of mine). The pita was ok...the falafel were nothing special and the sauce on the pita was very dry (maybe it was tahini?) and tasted bitter. The greek fries were french fries with feta, greek seasonings and some type of dressing (most greek fries I've had in the past have had lemon juice on them...but this looked to be more of a dressing, although it did taste lemon-y). The fries were good and I ended up pouring the leftover cheese and dressing into the falafel pita to help it not taste so bitter. The place was hopping  though, and only got busier the longer we were there, so maybe it was just my menu choice that wasn't that great....because everyone else seemed to enjoy what they were eating."}
{"text":"Expensive compared to other (better) Greek restaurants in the area!   Tried it several times but food was always disappointing especially hummus and Greek salad.  And, the final straw was the poor customer service of both order-takers we dealt with...no help, rude and abrupt.  Won't go again!"}
{"text":"Price: $11, no tip. 

Food quality: I got the chicken Gyro salad. The chicken was paper thin and watered down, so this was not very appealing at all. The salad consisted mostly of iceberg lettuce with very few onions and very little feta cheese. it was warm, not hot.

however, we have also gotten the regular Gyro salad and this was much better. I guess the meat is lamb? regardless, the portion was huge, and the meat was delicious. There were plenty of fresh vegetables and olives in addition to the iceberg lettuce. The portion was so huge that I was able to take home half to eat later.

Food variety: there is definitely a good variety to the menu, especially considering the restaurants very small size.

Service: they are very friendly and very efficient.

Cleanliness: not the cleanest place I've ever seen, but nothing stands out as particularly dirty. It is a small cramped environment and so we usually sit in the rickety plastic tables outside."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite. Always friendly and the Chicken shawarma is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here as a kid. We used to love their little pizza puffs. I still do nice and spicy. But my absolute favorite is their vegetarian platter. Their gyros are bomb but I just love the platter. Dolmas, falafel, hummus, baba ganoush, and pita. For ten bucks it's an awesome filling lunch."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this one from the start, seeing as how I found it on Yelp, and it had nothing but great reviews... well, my fellow Yelpers didn't let me down! WOW, I will be coming here very often. I got the Chicago Gyro, my other half got the Chicken Gyro, and we split the Cilantro/ Jalapeno hummus. Everything was fresh and REALLY delicious... and CHEAP. They even had passionfruit tea and lemonade for the most amazing Arnold Palmer to ever touch your lips. Nice staff, clean restaurant, lots to choose from... you just can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Went here for a gyro and a dog.  The gyro was okay, it was big, but not too tasteful.  The chicago style hot dog was ok, but $3.50...really??  We too waited a long time for our food.  The employees were nice, and the place is small and clean.   I don't think I will come back here too often."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place around 8:15 on a Monday night.  It's AMAZING!  Friendly service, casual atmosphere, delicious food, huge portions, and it's all reasonably priced.  We ordered the #13 gyros pita and the #1 gyros plate.  Everything was tasty, fresh and hot; the meat, rice, sauce, pita, etc.  We'll definitely be back and encourage everyone to check this place out."}
{"text":"Always friendly, always good, hot food, have had their vegetable plate... chicken in a pita, steak on a pita, fries, salad baklava all have been great!"}
{"text":"I've had the Falafel sandwich from here a couple times and I'm certainly a fan. It's a bit of a drive from my house but the food is worth the wait. 

Service is super helpful and friendly but once you put in an order it usually takes a while for the food to come out... I think that's a sign that they cook it fresh. When you do get your food it tastes like the the cooks took their time with it.

Also the first time I ate here I ordered my food to go and I'm not sure if they were running low on tahini sauce or just rushed it or something but it was not that tasty. Only when I returned at a later date and ordered my food to dine-in did I get the real experience of a delicious well prepared Falafel sandwich. 

The french fries here are the best I've had at any kebab/gyro joint so I would say whatever you order make sure you get a side of tasty potatoes. I've had the hummus as well and it's got solid flavor so I would recommend that as well. 

Probably the best part about this restaurant is the business hours on Sunday. It's impossible to find falafel on a Sunday so for that Chicago Gyros can count on my return business."}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant a thousand times and finally decided to check it out on Yelp.  After seeing many positive reviews I decided to stop in for lunch today.  This place is fantastic.  I picked up a large order for several co-workers and have received rave reviews for the chicken hummus as well as the Gyro sandwiches.  

The food was priced very reasonably and the waitstaff was extremely courteous and pleasant.  This place will definitely be added as a staple to our meal rotation going forward!"}
{"text":"I came here after finding out that King Gyros is closed on Sundays.  After driving all the way from Chandler, I was not going home without some meat.  Thankfully Chicago Gyros was nearby and I remembered it had good reviews.  I had the Chicago gyro with Greek salad.  The gyro was very good.  Plenty of meet with good tzatziki sauce, tomato, and onion, wrapped in a chewy but not too heavy pita bread.  The flavor combination was just right and I devoured the whole sandwich.  I was not too impressed with the Greek salad.  For some reason, the dressing tasted a little bitter.  I also tried some of my friend's fries.  The texture was good.  Nice and fat.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  But somehow, I could not get enough potato taste out of it.  I'm not sure if it was their potato or their oil.  I'll just stick with the pita sandwich next time.  This place is way too far to drive to on a frequent basis, but they just opened Pita Heaven in Chandler and I think it is related.  I will try that next time."}
{"text":"I've been here many, many times for lunch, it is as good as most people say it is. I rarely order anything other than the Gyro \"special\" for lunch which comes with fries or salad and a drink for $7-9. Simply put, I have yet to find a better gyro in metropolitan phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Super casual, but high quality and fresh.  They shave the meat off the spit, which is essential in a great gyro.  Plus they have a spicy tsasiki that's super.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but I have always been happy with my orders and the staff is always nice.  There are also a few table outside but you just overlook the Safeway parking lot..."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Chicago and enjoying all the great food there, I am hesitant when it comes to places that use the city as a gimmick in their name. This is not one of them. The menu is vast, and desirable. The gyros are among the best I have ever had. All of the food I saw looked great, and the people eating all looked very pleased. It's the type of place well worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"Their tzatiki is dill-laden to an extreme (which I generally have no problem with). For the most part they are pretty tasty, them having crinkle fries was the best part according to the girlfriend. Would I go back? Maybe, but I will hit up Z's first to judge the local competition...."}
{"text":"Today I had the chicken shwarma at Chicago Gyros and I think it's good. Nice flavor to the chicken, lots of toppings, good tzatziki, tons of fries. I would like to see one change though. For a true shwarma, the meat should be carved off of a piece of broiled meat. At Chicago Gyros, you get big chunks of chicken on the shwarma. So technically, it's not really a shwarma... 

I'll definitely go back! I think I'll try their baba and falafel next time. Yum!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken gyro, always busy and the food is always the same always fresh and made to order, One downside is that they charge for every little sauce but the other main reason is that rude white guy receptionist with the glasses that works there, just a jerk and a half, I will not let myself or anyone I know go there until they get a replacement that has better customer service skills and more people savvy , stay away! This isn't my first trip down there and my review is strong, it's been the same for a long time and I got fed up with it to a point that I should let people know!! Thank you"}
{"text":"Tasty steak med platter.  Good gyros.  Excellent, fluffy, fresh, warm pita.
Fast service.  Makes my list for quick good stuff."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for a co-workers birthday.  Food is sooooo good.  Excited to try out more items on the menu."}
{"text":"My name is Jill and I have a mild addiction to their steak plate. I usually come home from tempe and just grub until I can't breathe from their food. So good. great service and they know your order if you go there enough.
I can't say enough great things about this place:)"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here for lunch on the weekends often and it has totally replaced Cyprus Grill (on 20th St and Camelback) for us. Everytime we want Greek, I always suggest this place. 

The gyros are huge and the Tzatzki sauce is awesome (they don't skimp on it either)! I always get the combo and the fries are perfect. I always have left overs that I enjoy the next day for lunch. 

This isn't the place to go for a sit down restaurant experience though. It is more the lunch or quick bite place. But is soo good! 

They are very nice and appreciate your business. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for sure!  My husband and I have tried a few places for Greek food and all of it has been mediocre until we found this spot. I came across Chicago Gyros on Yelp and I am beyond pleased with this find.  I've now gone on 3 occasions and they haven't failed in the consistency of their food and service.  The best Gyros and tzatziki sauce by far that we've found in Phoenix.  The portions are more than generous!  The basmati rice is excellent if you order one of their plates.  This place is definitely one of our new favorite regular spot in our takeout rotation!  

I recommended that our friends try their other location (since it was closer to where they work) and they were all as pleased as we were.  I don't normally write reviews online, but I think this place deserved a plug because of it's \"not so obvious\" location."}
{"text":"We found this little hole in the wall by accident. We were in the area looking for something to eat and saw the sign Chicago Gyros. It is a small restaurant that is family run. I had my standard order of a Gyro and fries. The gyro was delicious. It was overstuffed with meat and fillings. They generally don't fill me up but this one did. The fries were your standard fast food type of fries, they were hot and they were crispy. I don't go for gyros worrying about the fries. The owner and I believe his daughter were very friendly and helpful with the orders. The food was served quickly and was the right temperature. I enjoy dealing with locally owned places and this is one I will be returning to."}
{"text":"Kronos brand Gryros, good tzatziki and the right pita are pretty much all you need for a good gyros.  This place has it and they put the right amount of everything on it.  

Who cares about great service or ambience...it's a gyros place.  In fact, it would be out of character for those types of restaurants.  (cheeseburger, cheeseburger no fries??)

p.s. the kabobs are really, really good too."}
{"text":"First went here a few weeks ago, and I still feel a little guilty which is why I thought of leaving a nice review. To start off, nearly 10 minutes prior to closing, we called this place up and they were happy to take our order. My mother and I drove over there to pick up the 4 gyros all with fry sides we had ordered. Once we got home and got into our food, my mom started to make a big stammer over them forgetting to put the yogurt sauce on our gyros! She left the house to go get some and 5 minutes later, I found packages of the stuff in a separate bag we never opened up! Everything was so neatly wrapped up in the large to-go sac and as starving as we were, our stomachs did all the thinking thus we didn't go through it all! Bottom line is, they are very generous and give you everything you need! As far as the food goes, I've had better gyros before, but their fries were great!"}
{"text":"Really good Gyro. 1st one I have had since arriving from the midwest and it was better than I expected. Will be back when I am in the area"}
{"text":"Love the gyros. The spices are great and ingredients are super fresh. Ill definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have been so delinquent in writing a review about this place! They have a location near 46th St. and Indian School that I frequent pretty often, and it must be said: their food is phenominal and you MUST try it. 

Being from Detroit, I am a die-hard coney and cheese fry fan. I have NEVER been able to find really good chili-cheese fries out here in the valley....until now :) Yes! Chicago Gyro is my answer to amazing chili-cheese fries in the Valley. Their fries have this wonderful seasoning on them, and the chili-cheese is the CLOSEST i have found to Coney chili-cheese. Thats absolutely a feather in their cap. 

Aside from the amazing chili-cheese fries, I am also a fan of their dolmadas, and I usually order them together. In fact, I have ordered them together so many times, that the nice guy named Brian at the counter knows when I call because im apparently the only one that puts these two things together. Seriously! I'll call ahead to order for lunch and this is usually how the conversation goes: 

Brian: \"Chicago Gyros, this is Brian\"
Me: \"I'd like an order for carry-out....one order of chili-cheese fries with the chili and the cheese on the side, and one order of dolmadas\"
Brian: \"Oh hey Brit hows it going. Ill have that ready for you in ten\".

He knows EVERY time. Its now gotten to the point where I can call and after he picks up I can just say \"Its Brit\" and then he tells me that my order will be ready in ten. Love it. 

Ive also had their hummus, their gyro, and their greek salad....all wonderful choices. Everything is served fresh, and you never have to wait too long or pay too much. 

Great food, great staff....many more visits to come from me."}
{"text":"This is one of the first places I went to entirely because I found them on Yelp, and I was not disappointed.  I've never had any sort of food in Chicago, never been.  But I like this place more than any other greek place I've tried.    

While the prices could be a little lower for my liking (I want to say $8-$10), they are completely justified once you see the amount of food that you get.  I always get the Gyro wrap, #1 I believe.  Has a lot of meat; comes with a ton of fries.  I suggest this place when I don't want to make dinner but I really want to feel full.

It can get pretty busy at times, but when I've been they've had a cool headed guy answering the phone, taking orders, and handing out food all at once.  I should learn my lesson and start calling ahead with my own orders.  But I've lucked out since there has always been a game on when I'm waiting.  The place has a dive feel, but sports some very nice flat screen TVs."}
{"text":"Standard gyros, salads and fries kind of place. Great deal on the combo meals for $8. The restaurant is good for take-out or you can eat it there, plenty of seating for their average traffic. Parking lot right in front has plenty of space."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come to, now that they have new Management. We live the Mediterranean Chicken Salad with the spicy Tzaziki on the size. The Chicken Shawarma is amazing.. The staff is very friendly and committed to great service and quality..."}
{"text":"That this place operates as a business remotely successfully is a complete mystery of modern mankind.  With nobody else in the store, a friend and I waited over 30 minutes for 2 gyro plates.  No I am not exaggerating or joking.  The Owners are Arabs and as I speak a bit of Arabic I found that the owner whom I was talking to was training her new nephew/cook and that he didn't know how to make the food yet.  I asked if she could make it foe us as we needed to go and she said he won't learn if he doesn't cook.  Unbelievable, she couldn't wait till we had our food and had him cook small portions to learn???  We received our food to realize the meat was horribly over-seasoned and the fries were cold.  On a positive note the soda fountain worked just fine."}
{"text":"Excellent food :) I give 5 stars to the food & costumer service and 2/5 starts to the portion , prices are up or portions are smalls ....."}
{"text":"Luv luv luv this place!  I run over after I ride my horse on the weekends and get a gyro fries and greek salad which has the best dressing!   The tzatziki rocks too! Nice owners, go visit!!!"}
{"text":"Read about it and saw a number of good reviews so I thought I'd  gave it a try. Clean, fast and efficient.  Service fast but gruff..so know what you want before you order....they like to move things along.  Good quality of the food and good value....nice menu, big selection.  Had Chicago hot dog and fries...dog excellent, fries OK, not great.  Greek salad; very good.  Will go back to try 3 or 4 other items.  Wife (picky) really liked it, too. Lots of things that woman like; humus, salads etc."}
{"text":"Stopped by their last week. So good I've been there 3 times in a week. On a gyro binge. Quick, clean, friendly. A favorite when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great overall gyros, fries, and Greek salad!! Service was very fast too. Wish it was closer to our neighborhood, best I've had in AZ for sure, will definitely return when I'm in that area again!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years! I love the owner, he always greets us by name! That is hard to find in a city of this size. The food is AWESOME! I mean I drive at least once a week to eat here and I don't live nearby. There are tons of other gyros places between me and this place and I will not stop at any of them. Don't get this one confused with Chicago Gyros at 59th and 101 in the FRY's shopping center. Not the same one or owners. Their food is bad, THIS one is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat love there Caesar salads and their Philly cheese steak gyro. Great customer service."}
{"text":"I love when restaurants get it right! Chicago gyro has got it down. Great food. Clean. Friendly. Fast. Good prices. I wish I could shake the owner's hand and tell them they rock. I love that every detail of the Vienna beef Chicago dog is perfect even down to the poppy seed bun. I will be spending my money here!
The only thing I don't like is the cashier I think his name is Brandon. Brandon is rude. Besides that I love this place"}
{"text":"I have been here at least 10 times since my Hubby & I bought our 1st house in the summer of 08. We could walk here, we live 3 blocks away. Although, we have yet to do that. We've only ate inside 2 or 3 times, we usually just carry out because they close pretty early at 8pm, 6pm on Sundays. But its a cute little spot & like others have already stated its really clean.

We usually get the same thing every time, he gets the chicken pita with a greek salad & I get the gyros pita (with an extra side of tzatziki sauce) with fries. He'll switch it up sometimes & get the gyros pita & I have tried the hot dog & pizza puff. I also love their hummus, its so good! I have also tried the spanakopita, it was good but the flavor was too rich for me. We got a to go order tonight for dinner & for the 1st time I tried their baklava. It was pretty yummy but a tad too sweet for me. I have tried their cheesecake once before & it was awful, still frozen in the center! They also have pibb xtra in their soda fountain, our fav!

Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty gyros with a pretty decent portions. They also have some American food items on the menu also. Good place for lunch if you work in the area. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food. Good prices. Even on delivery they are great. Tried the chicken and the gyro gyro pittas. Both outstanding. No this is my wife and I's staple at least once a month."}
{"text":"This place is a total filth. The white guy in the front is so rude and made my experience uncomfortable. I asked for extra sauce he rang it up and tell me I have to pay him a dollar. It's not about the money but the service is terrible they need a nice girl with customer service skills in the fro"}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite of ours for years! Gyros salad is my favorite. The fries are crispy and you get plenty. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place has amazing Greek food. In my opinion, their \"Chicago Gyro\" is the best gyro to get. They have great vegetarian options as well! Their pitas are very soft and the hummus is very full of flavor.

If you are with someone who isn't a fan of Greek food, they have great alternates like hamburgers, hot dogs, fish n chips and chicken tenders! The baklava is also a must have. 

Wonderful & affordable Greek food."}
{"text":"I've never ordered anything other than the gyro and I can't say enough good things about it. Packed full of flavor and delicious until the last bite. It's like I never want it to end. They don't skimp on the meat either. The service is also great. Promtly greeted as soon as you walk through the door and not a long wait for the food. I really enjoy coming to this place and will eventually try something new! I can't imagine anything bad coming from this place."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but not stellar.  I've tried a number of their dishes and I will continue to go because it's nearby when I need my fix for gyros.  I like their salads, although ask for the dressing on the side or it comes saturated.  I do not like their wraps, especially their grilled veggie wrap had a strange taste (maybe not so fresh?) and I had to throw it out.  On the other hand, their falafel is good, gyro meat is good, chicken is good, regular hummus is good (I'm not a fan of their other flavors).  My hubbie loves the Italian beef sandwich and I eat the giardineria that comes with.  Oh, and at the risk of being beaten by other yelpers, it's not my favorite tzatiki sauce. Good but doesn't induce cravings like King Gyro's."}
{"text":"I just went here on a whim after seeing good reviews on yelp. It was delicious! Fast, friendly service.  The salad was so crisp and perfectly prepared."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I  drive all the way over and wait in line during the lunch rush on our 30 min break (We'll risk it for Chicago Gyros!).  I also go there on the weekends because it's soo good and my boyfriend loves it too! I've been to other Greek Places in the area and their meat is dry and the people are rude. 

CHICAGO GYROS IS WHERE IT'S AT FOR SOME YUMMY GYROS!!!"}
{"text":"Well I went to order from your company online because you delivery says $20.00 order not specific for food only.. Then to be called and told that my order needs to 20.00 for food only and the rudeness of the meal man which I'm assuming the company you signed with was a mistake on your part because him and his staff are very rude!! I'm one person and 20.00 of food for myself would be wasting food and money!!! I'm sorry but I will not longer be coming into your restaurant to get food and I will be blasting this on all social net works to let them know that the meal man is s rude person and any business that use him should be boycotted. If you were smart you would find someone else to to your on line and delivery service for you!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit was very favorable!  REALLY enjoyed the gyro salad!  Good mix of fresh-cut veggies, a generous amount of well-prepared gyro meat, excellent dressing, and a side of their housemade tzatziki.  Friendly service to me and the other customers.  Comfortable, clean surroundings for a quick meal.  Look forward to trying hummus and other menu items on subsequent visits. Well done!"}
{"text":"Gyros are quite good, but have gotten pricey.  Italian beef sandwiches are VERY light on the meat, definitely not worth it.  Cashier has a tip jar that isn't shared with the kitchen help."}
{"text":"Nice people, great food. Just make sure you are ready for the cooks and workers to be always staring and checking you out! Haha"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, and the service was really awesome! The girls were super friendly and even brought my food to my table. I really appreciate good service like theirs. I ate the gyro with fries and thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We ordered take out.  The prices are reasonable and the portions were huge.  We ordered a gyro plate and the chicken shwarma.  The salad that came with the gyro plate was super fresh.  We also ordered the fried mushrooms (I can't resist fried mushrooms), and they were NOT good.  The breading was horrible and had this gritty consistency.  The mushrooms tasted off.  Note to self, stick with the gyro and chicken.  Besides the mushrooms, everything else was tasty."}
{"text":"Under new ownership. Food was good before, now it's great. Spoke with Diana the owner and was pleasantly surprised. Very nice woman who takes pride in her product. Happy to see it, and I wish there was more like her."}
{"text":"Fresh Gyros Salad with Pita Bread is Tasty! The Baklava is Homemade. Generous Servings @ Resonable Prices."}
{"text":"This place has great food and most importantly is very consistent - no ups and downs. The basic gyros are fantastic, but I really like the Philly gyro. The salad is good and so are the fries."}
{"text":"Gyros was delicious, fries we outstanding and crispy. It was I didn't even share, and I'm a sharing person. Quick service and great food."}
{"text":"Awesome tasting and very fresh.  I had the moist and tasty chicken gyros with yummy tzatziki sauce and Greek salad, both were exceptionally wonderful.  My husband had the seasoned beef and lamb gyros with fries, piled with lots of meat and oh my, the fries so fresh.  Service is great! This place is a hidden gem with great food."}
{"text":"My comfort food place.. love their kababs, their basmati rice and their tzatziki sauce. So close to my house and so homely (yes i grew up eating authentic med food)...."}
{"text":"The BEST gyros ever! My husband and I have been eating here for years. We always get take out and our order has never been wrong. It's refreshingly consistent. I always see the same amazing guy with the glasses and he is friendly, helpful, and efficient. (Ignore what Stewart L. says, he clearly doesn't know what he's talking about)"}
{"text":"Awesomeness! The food is really tasty. Gyro has good flavor and the price is reasonable. 
The Yelp famous fries are really good indeed!"}
{"text":"This place has a very friendly staff that works hard to please. They provide quality food and large portions. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"I love this place! We usually order the gyros, which are huge!!! I usually take out some of the meat and save it for the next day's breakfast to mix with some scrambled eggs! 

Anyways, the pizza puffs are so delicious! Great and fried... need I say more? 
The Philly Fries are also delicious. Cheesy sauce, peppers, onions, and Italian beef. So, so, so good! 

The customer service is really good. The family that works there is always friendly. We usually don't have to wait long for our food: maybe about five minutes."}
{"text":"This place is convenient for work lunch, the food is good, but the price has far exceeded the \"value\" point for me.. over $10 for a Greek salad is over the line for me, i won't go back. (..and no, I don't need extra sauce for extra $$, but thanks for always offering.)
I can go down the street where the Fellas are all Good and get a nice Greek gyro salad special AND a tasty lentil soup for 5.99... almost half the price for better food."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff. Clean. Fast service. Combo is around ten bucks. I would recommend this place if you like hidden gems vs franchises."}
{"text":"This is a mediocre Greek place. Food is overpriced, \"Greek\" fries are just regular French fries with some garlic sauce. I like tea, but all they carry are flavored teas. I love Greek food and live near this place, yet I'd never go back."}
{"text":"Awesome gyros.. Gotta try the Chicago dogs next time. Fries are perfect and not greasy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been reoccuring customers of Chicago Gyros for a year now and we have never been disappointed with the service, cleanliness or food at this restaurant. We live in North Scottsdale and drive the distance whenever we want a gyro just because we like this place so much."}
{"text":"These guys are really awesome.  Don't bother with Pita Jungle Corporate Pita Pimps, you want Chicago Gyro trust me.  Greasy Heaven!"}
{"text":"These are the largest Gyros I have ever seen. In the Safeway shopping center. Take out right on time. Son had fries and a burger. Will eat here again. Prices are great."}
{"text":"I started going here about 2 years ago when a coworker found it. I have driven past this building for years and never even noticed it. Its a little hard to see with the circle k in the way. Anyway, the first time I pulled in there were 2 Phoenix police motorcycles in the parking lot. JACKPOT! I have always had good luck with places if the cops eat there. Those guys know where to get the good stuff. The Gyros are done correctly and are consistently good. The right amount of food and the fries are tasty with free drink refills. This place is always busy and can get really busy around lunch time but I don't mind. Its worth the wait."}
{"text":"Oh, God Almighty. I thought I found a good gyro place (see previous review), but then I found this place, and I must say I am ashamed of my previous review! This place is the tits! Much better! The only drawback is that the gyro is HUGE, and I literally take half the gyro meat off and save it for later. I haven't tried anything besides the gyro, but the pictures of their entrees look promising. I just can't get over my love of the gyro to order anything else. Yum."}
{"text":"Great gyro place it is nice to have one in the neighborhood. Not only was my gyro delicious but it was very well priced and it was ready in a hurry. I sat on the patio and the women brought my order out to me. It does get a little busy with teenagers around the time school gets out but I will definitely return for another taste Greek delight."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times now.  The food is very good and always seems fresh.  The drink selection isn't good, and as much as they charge for meals, it's tacky that they charge for an extra side of tzatziki sauce with a meal.  C'mon guys, you're killing me!  Eat the 5 cents and make your customers happier!"}
{"text":"So yummy! I crave their warm pitas and hummus. My family loves their Gyros and French Fries! They have a great selection of Greek food and Chicago's favorite foods!"}
{"text":"I visit this location all the time and they always get my order correct and the employees work so hard. Love this place."}
{"text":"The dining area is usually clean.  The schwarma and gyro are good.  They come with a respectable amount of meat.  By far my favorite is the Greek fries.  They are a must try.  Staff have been friendly.  Have ordered for there and take out."}
{"text":"While I was waiting for my order, this guy next in line kept asking the girl at the counter \"This is the real shit, right? It's the real shit?\"

Well yeah, at Chicago Gyros it definitely is. I live a few minutes away from here, but had not stopped by in quite some time. I had worked up an appetite this particular morning and I found myself in the gyro kind of mood.

Goddamn, I think that gyro changed my life. It was succulent, flavorful, and so amazing that as you are devouring it you'd wish it could go on forever. It was basic, and perfect, no tomatoes or lettuce fouling up the works. My gyro was bursting full of meat and homemade tsaziki, and the accompanying ample helping of crinkle cut fries were also delicious (Greek places always have the best fries, I think because the only other thing they use the fryer for is the falafel?). It's the kind of meal you'll get a wild craving for, and I just know that I'll be sampling the rest of their menu with more frequency."}
{"text":"I was craving for some Mediterranean food and wanted something close by the movie theaters. Yelp led me to here!

I couldn't decide between a gyro or falafel wrap and went with the later. The boyfriend wanted to try out their Chicago dog from hearing all the rave reviews. 

My falafel was a-ma-zing!! At first, I thought they were a little smaller than normal, but once I was done those little beasts made me full! You have to get the french fries here, too! They come out perfectly crisp and they are not at all oily. The boyfriend was in love with his Chicago dog. He is not a fan of mustard at all, but he said theirs was pretty good! ( big props, he's pretty picky! )

Will definitely be back!

P.S. I love their OG mafia posters on the walls!"}
{"text":"Just recently found this place.  Amazing Gyros.  The Gyro meat specifically is some of the best in Phoenix.  Chicken on the Greek salads also very tasty.

A little bit of a hole in the wall place, but DEFINITELY worth trying!"}
{"text":"Great Spot ! Very easy to pass .. but let me tell ya ! The Rock ! Clean ! fast ! & chi town Style  there much respected on my Block ! Get sum if your in for sum Real Grub"}
{"text":"Amazing schwarma. All the meat is fantastic. Fast service. Cool people. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and it's in our regular lunch rotation.
Everything is excellent and fresh.  Our taste buds are thankful!
I love the chicken and hummus, steak and hummus, and mediteranean chicken salad.  The produce is absolutely crisp, fresh and amazingly delicious.  We've tried a couple other places but keep coming back to Chicago Gyro, it never disappoints."}
{"text":"This is our go to for nights we feel like having takeout. The gyro is generous and delicious, and the Mediterranean salad always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Gyros I've had in Phoenix!  What is also great is you can order from their website, pay for it and have it ready for you when you get there!  (Great for those of us with 30 min lunches)."}
{"text":"Can you say...YUMMO! I had the Gyro combo. The french fries were so light and crunchy I almost didnt get to the Gyro. Boy am I glad I did. The pita was warm and soft and the Tzaziki sauce was spot on. I look forward to working my way through their whole menu."}
{"text":"I've been back two more times and each time the food was not very good-one time I had the beef schwarma pita- I found the sauce nasty.  Not going back."}
{"text":"I come here once or twice a week to get the Mediterranean chicken salad. It is amazing!!! The service is excellent and the people are so friendly. It's always clean too. If you like Greek food you need to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Always fresh, always tasty, made quickly.  The Pita bread is cooked to perfection.  I've had better Hummus, but there is not much to it anyway."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times and I have moved to Phoenix from the Midwest very recently. I love the gyros. They are super good. The meat is so juicy and never dry. I have had both the rice and fries as a side. Another treat, dolmas! These are a huge favorite and taste amazing. Both the gyros and the dolmas come with tzaziki sauce. So good because it is thick and creamy. Lastly, I had the hot Italian sandwich. It's a soft, greasy mess and I love it. It is not mushy by any means. The peppers on it are spot on. Go here for a good Chicago meal."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch combo, which is a lamb gyro with fries and a drink all for like $7 (I can't remember the actual price, but that's about right).  The fries were crispy on the outside, somewhat flaky on the inside, and neither fat nor skinny, right in-between.  The gyro was in a warm pita with a BUNCH of delicious lamb, some tomatoes, and a good helping of their tzatziki.  I love tzatziki, and this was pretty good, but it could have been a bit more cucumbery for my taste. 

Cheap HUGE delicious meal.  Definitely great for lunch!"}
{"text":"The Shwarma is so damn good here! This is a great spot to grab lunch any day of the week."}
{"text":"Staff super friendly and food very hot and fresh and delicious!! Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! My food is always hot and ready and I'm never disappointed!!  Absolutely delicious food!! Never gets old!! Wish the prices weren't so steep at times but definitely worth the money regardless!!"}
{"text":"Chicago Gyros gives you lots of Mediterranean choices from appetizers to sides to plates.  Yes, lots to think about and their colorful, photo- based menu shows you exactly what you will be getting.  They also have a menu above the counter that shows you everything so I don't think that most people will make a mistake ordering. 
We ordered the spanakopita (spinach pie), vegetarian combo and the chicken plate.  The spinach pie was fresh and delicious.  The vegetarian combo had hummus, babaganoush, kalamata olives, grape leaves and falafel.  Absolutely terrific especially the babaganoush. The falafel were crispy and tasty.  They gave us tzaziki and tahini sauces to accompany our meal.  The chicken platter came with yellow basmati rice which was very flavorful, and fluffy pitas.  The chicken was delicious, fresh and tender.  As a side to the chicken platter, we were able to get a Greek salad for $1.75.  Super good and what great pricing. 

You will notice that I used the word fresh over and over in this review.  That's because you have to give credit where credit is due.  Some places reheat pre-prepared food.  Here they do not.  Here you order and might have to wait a bit but it will be well worth it.  
The person behind the counter was attentive and asked how our food was more than once.  We appreciated that. 
Coming back real soon."}
{"text":"Spinach pie==5 stars
Vegetarian combo=5 stars
Gyro Sandwich= 5 stars
French fries=4 stars--not made well done as requested
Clean environment= 5 stars 
Service=5 stars......
 
Everybody loved the food!"}
{"text":"Love it here.  Meat is always tender.   I usually get a Caesar salad and the dressing on it is awesome. Gyros always good.  Everything I've tried has been good"}
{"text":"Stopped in just now at 7:55pm. Having never been there before, we were surprised they close at 8pm. No worries, just needing a couple quick sandwiches with sides and drinks to go. As we walked up to the counter, the cook in back told the cashier the grill was already off. Wow! Pretty disappointing and very unprofessional. We live in the area. Could have gained a new customer. Not now."}
{"text":"I went lunch here today, ordered a Chicago gyro combo.  It is good size of meal.  They give good amount of gyros meat that's very nice and won't be disappointed.  The sauce is good too.  I got introduced the hot sauce, but I didn't know it cost extra, but it is ok, good to try.  The fries is very nice as well, about 1/4\" thick, crispy on every bites.  The restaurant itself is clean with large tv playing sports.  The waitress is very friendly.  Overall, I am satisfied.  Some suggestions,  add some cucumber slices in the sandwich could increase the texture and freshness, every bite with that amount of meat is a bit dry for the last few bites (don't take this wrong, the meat itself is delicious). The ketchup I suggest to be ice cold.  The hot fresh crispy fries with ice cold ketchup will bring it to the next level."}
{"text":"I gave it a two because it was clean. Decent food, high price. Expect to pay $11 for nothing special chicken strips, regular fries, and a drink. Most likely I won't go back unless I have no other choice within a 2 mile radius."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for Greek Food. Freshly cooked and delicious. The ambience is nice and great customer service. I am from Chicago and they have the real Vienna Beef there. It's authentic! Excellent staff, especially Lever. He keeps coming back because he is so nice and accommodating. ***** star"}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro & it was wonderfully prepared. The service was fast and the portions were generous. Next time I will have to remember to order a side of tzatzik sauce. Didn't have enough."}
{"text":"Skinny punk behind the counter messed up my order, then blamed me, cursed at me and told to never come back. He is clearly NOT that smart, that I would even consider that. No wonder the place was completely empty, much better options in the valley !"}
{"text":"Gyros are great hot wing have way too much sauce and it is runny more like soup. To messy to eat"}
{"text":"I really have eating here so many times and never left a review. It's time to leave them one. 
The food is delicious and fantastic!
Love it 

EA"}
{"text":"This place is so good! The interior is nice and clean. They have two tvs on the wall and the place is spacious. I had the Chicago gyro and it tasted so fresh! There was an abundance of the meat and the veggies. I thoroughly enjoyed the Chicago gyro. The pricing was good also. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Their gyros plate is my all time favorite! Love the yellow rice, heaps of gyros, fresh salad with plenty feta cheese/olives/tomato/cucumber. The tzatziki sauce is the best to dip your gyros in. I only knocked off a star, because their prices have gone up in recent months. Much less than a year ago the plate was 8.99, now it is 10.79 or so. And they stopped giving plastic utensils in recent pick-up orders. I guess small businesses have it hard these days. The food is definitely great tho."}
{"text":"Freaking delicious! I've had their Italian beef and Gyro. Easily the best In the Valley."}
{"text":"WOW ...

Chicken Pita and Italian Beef beautifully showcased the essence of great flavorful moist meat sandwich-like greatness!  

Salad was balanced and fresh and the light lemony greek dressing was too too delicious!  Garlic sauce and Tzatziki was perfection.

READ: Chicago Gyros is the place all of those other \"Chicago/Mediterranean Pita\" places only dream they could be if they cared enough about the quality of their food...their attention to flavor, texture, balance, and quality is unmatched.  handsdown :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite gyro shop. 

Their lamb and beef gyros are very fresh and flavorful. You can also order souvlaki, hummus and your other favorite Mediterranean foods."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the gyros - Excellent!! Generous portions, all the trimmings and the fries are great too! I have a family of four who all love the gyros and I usually order 2 gyros plates with two extra pitas - comes with fries, etc. plus two greek salads. Plenty of food for four around 20-22 bucks...five bucks each - not bad for a budget...

One negative - I live nearby and can tell you - do not order online and do not call it in...take the time go in and order...it takes a little longer but, I honestly have never been dissappointed by their gyros!

PS - I'm from Chicago and in my opinnion - it's one of the best Chicago gyros in the Valley!"}
{"text":"The Gyros are so good! I'm from Baltimore and this gyro is as good as any I could get in my home town. With homemade tzatziki and the perfect crispy French fries...I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Talk about a bitchen Gyro!!! Load that thing up with the Gardien Peppers & Tzatziki Sauce!! Oh and ask for an extra Tzatziki sauce just because - it's sooo good. I can't really speak for Gyro's in Chicago or for that matter any other place than Phoenix so with that said. THIS PLACE RULES!!  I've had a Gyro over at Greek Town on 7St and while the food was authentic and NO YOU CAN'T have any damn FRENCH FRIES with your Gyro... I dare you to even ask that dude - so while it may be authentic it was also a light weight compared to the Feast of Awesomeness that you'll experience at Chicago Gyros!! and don't forget the extra Tzatziki sauce.... 

p.s. The Fries are damn good too!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! A very casual, and relaxing dining experience. The good is always good. Very authentic gyros, and pitas. I eat here every week and it never fails to  be enjoyable. Highly recommended place to eat gyros!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious..
Great place run by great people. Lever and the staff offer excellent customer service to top it all off."}
{"text":"Our go-to take out supper! Everything we've had is flavorful and fresh. Love the gyro plate!"}
{"text":"Just great sandwiches!  IMO they serve the best gyros around.  Sandwiches are yummy and portions are hefty.  Salads always fresh.  It's a neighborhood gem and a quaint little place for so-much-better-than Fast Food!  Give this place a try but be sure to go when you're really hungry.  You'd be sad if you had to leave any part of your meal behind.  Go for lunch and you won't need dinner!"}
{"text":"First thing I have to say is that this place is hard for us more nocturnally inclined folks to eat at since they close at 8pm.  When we did get our first shot at feasting on the delicious cuisine they had to offer boy were we happy.

The basic Gyro meal with a Gyro, fries and a drink was 7.75 and that is exactly what I ordered, not wanting to try anything fancy the first time.  It took maybe 5 minutes from order to food sitting in front of me and the first thing I noticed was that there was quite a heaping of thin sliced lamb meat piled onto the fresh looking pita slathered in sauce and topped with some onion.  I opted out of getting tomato.  

First bite was awesome, and the next bite was just as good if not better as my brain realized that I had probably found the best Gyro's I've had in Phoenix.  They weren't super greasy, the tzatziki sauce was great, and the onions were nice and crispy.

I ate the whole gyro before even taking a stab at the fries.  Probably not coincidentally the fries were actually quite good as well.  Yet again, not super greasy, and with ketchup, they had just the right flavor.  

They have Veggie friendly meals, and also chicken, steak and Filafel as well as a whole Chicago menu with things like Vienna Beef hot dogs and pizza puffs.  Overall it's a definite must try in Phoenix."}
{"text":"How is it that there are two solid gyro spots right down the street from each other and not one anywhere near where I live? 

I'm a fan of Z's Greek down the street from this place and figured I'd venture out and try something new. Chicago Gyros lived up to my expectations. Because of how close it is in proximity and goodness I have to compare it to Z's. 

I ordered the Gyro pita w/ fries and a drink and it came out to just under 9 bucks with a tip. I asked for extra lettuce and tzatziki sauce. The gyro was over flowing with meat, onions, tomatoes, and lettuce. The flavors were great. The fries were krinkle cut and lightly seasoned. The tzatziki sauce was excellent. 

Then interior was pretty cool. A HD flat screen with ESPN on and some cool lights hanging and posters on the wall. The service was decent. The guy was friendly and the food came out within 5 minutes or so. 

Here's how it matches up to Z's: 
Gyro - Chicago 
Fries - Z's 
Value - Push 
Service - Z's 
Tzatziki sauce - Chicago 
Interior - Chicago 

I'm a pretty big fan of Z's and was predicting I would regret trying something else so close to what I know and trust. After this first visit I have to give it to Chicago Gyros."}
{"text":"My kind of place for a gyro. Good portion of quality meat and fresh ingredients. The sauce is great and I just pour the whole thing on. Fries were well done and crisp. We'll be back to sample the other menu items."}
{"text":"As a Chicago native, I can easily say this place is authentic. The ambience is great and the customer service even better. The hummus and falafel were delicious and the hot dog tastes like it came from the Windy City.  AWESOME!"}
{"text":"They were about to close, but took my order and were very friendly and patient even though it was my first time there. Great food too! Lots of vegetarian options too. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I think this was the first bookmark I ever made, and I am always down for some Greek bliss. It's a little further north than I usually go, but dog-sitting for 3 attention-starved pups brought me just off of Union Hills, so a friend and I capitalized on the opportunity.

Just pulling up to the place, it was somewhat surprising how many damn signs they have in their windows with pictures of their food. I mean, just a crap-load of gyro, hummus, and desert pictures. Is that a bad thing? No, not a bit, simply surprising. The decor of the place follows suit though. Its like a McDonalds' cash register come to life. Every menu item has a picture behind the register, and there are a few posters throughout the joint. The upside was that it does completely sell their food. It only took a moment to grab a few gyro meals (gyro, fries, soda) and the hummus trio. It was a quick wait, and we were out the door.

Starting out with the hummus, I was pleased but not blown away. The trio included the standard hummus, jalapeno hummus, and roasted red pepper (at least that is what they tasted like). A huge hummus fan, I thought the standard was pretty good, the jalapeno was solid, but the red pepper just didn't have much flavor. It did come with hot flatbread, which is the perfect scooping material for my hummus.

Once I had a few bites of the hummus, I unwrapped the gyro and just went \"Wow\". Literally. It's just a big piece of flatbread absolutely stuffed with gyro meat. Going with no tomatoes and onions (not a fan), I thought it would be a little light, but no way. And after I bit into the gyro? Holy crap. I didn't say it that time, but the meat is flat out amazing. Sometimes, the meat in gyros can get a little dry but this was moist and flavorful throughout. I just ignored the hummus and worked through the Grecian goodness. It may be the best gyro I have ever had, and it easily has the best meat

I have to truly thank the Yelpers on this place. It is a bit far for a regular stop, but it will certainly be a place to go anytime I am up north or have the hankering for some gyro."}
{"text":"Their Italian Beef sandwhich is the best, lots of meat and flavor.  Chicken pita is the same, lots of meat!  Food comes out fast and prices are to be expected for the quality and amount (which means lunch is usually around $9)
If you are craving greek or good Chicago style food, don't go anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"We just returned to Chicago Gyro's and had an -okay dinner. I should note that, in comparison to Pita Jungle, which we visited last week, there is really no comparison: Pita Jungle is superior. 
The gyro meat at Chicago Gyro's was a little dry, but there was tons of it and it was smothered in the yummy sauce. My Greek salad was really good but again, Pita Jungle outdoes it. Still, it is a great place for an inexpensive lunch or dinner and they seem to have improved on the time it takes to get your meal."}
{"text":"This place is great. Go there on the weekends. Easy to drive right passed it. Right behind Circle K. Place is very clean and has fun Chi town stuff on the walls. All the pitas are good as well as all the Chicago favorites. They also offer other fresh and healthy choices like hummus, Baba Ghanoush, etc. Owner is typically there. Friendly service. Prices are very reasonable and service is quick. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Another sign of a good restaurant with multiple locations is that one is as good as the next-certainly true with Chicago Gyros!  i had gyros, I couldn't resist, these are about the best you'll find in the Valley.  I've been all around and I'm always delighted to find another Chicago Gyros store for lunch!!"}
{"text":"This is far and away the closest thing that I've found in Phoenix that rivals the great hot dog/gyro places back home (Windy City Gyros in Wrigleyville [on Broadway just south of Irving Park rd since someone asked]) would be the gold standard-it almost brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it...).  
The gyros are very good, with solid tzatziki and pita.  Their Italian beef is also quite good piled high with giardinera."}
{"text":"I'll make this quick: dislike.

Girl at the register had an attitude, meat was super super thin and dry, they were cheap with it also.  Sauce was watery and tasteless......  It's a rip off... Total failed for a gyro (we had the Chicago Gyro btw)."}
{"text":"This place is great, their food is definitley meditteranean style, and their service is great. I would recommend the Beef Shawerma over the Gyro, if your looking for good falafel this is the place and my God the Chicken platter..YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and the place is spotless. I've been here several times for lunch and dinner, have tried a variety of items and I'm never disappointed. Family owned, and did I say clean? 

Keep it up guys, customer for life here."}
{"text":"Wonderful Gyros and Delicious hot dogs. The best part is that I can get out of there for under 8 bucks and be totally satisfied."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had a gyro pita and the home made cilantro jalapeño hummus. The pita was packed with meat. Fresh,  not dry or greasy. I watched the man shave it off the rotisserie.  The pita bread is not the store bought style that some restaurants use it seems like home made.  The hummus is the best I have ever had, you can definitely tell it is home made. They have a good selection of Mediterranean food and Chicago favs like Italian beef. Locally owned business, seemed like all of the employees were family members. 

Another bonus, they are right next door to the best craft beer store. Can make a beer run and get lunxh or dinner all in one stop! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe if took me this long to find this place! I found it while looking for a new place to try out on Yelp last week, and let me tell you folks...this is a true hidden gem!
Staff is super nice, and their gyros plate and chicken shawarma are absolutely amazing. I can't wait to try out other items on the menu. I've been there 2 times in the past week and I have a feeling I'll go back again a lot. They have online ordering through Amazon, Grubhub, Eat24... so awesome. Order your food, pick it up, and enjoy! Amazing."}
{"text":"This is a great local, neighborhood greek spot.  I recommend taking it to go, you won't be dissapointed.  

This is a family owned business and the food is equally as good every time.

I recommend the gyro plates, hummus or vegetarian plate.  The chicken gyro plate is my favorite and all their food is very flavorable.  So far, this is the only local spot I would recommend in the NW area.  It puts other greek gyro places to shame!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!!    Have been looking for an authentic gyro as good as Greektown in Chicago and boy did I find it."}
{"text":"Oh-My-God!  There's a lot of good Mediterranean food in the Phoenix area, but this is the tops!  The name doesn't give the place justice.  The food is awesome (Gyro, soluvaki, everything else on the menu).  Doesn't matter the time, the place has a good crowd.  If you are hungry, go there!  Dang it, now I'm hungry again!"}
{"text":"Just your everyday hole & the wall restaurant. Food is cool, but nothing to go crazy about."}
{"text":"This is a great, little place close to my house. I go there often. If you haven't tried it, I would highly recommend you go."}
{"text":"I fondly remember a favorite back at school in New Haven CT that we frequented called Mamouns and this has been my comparison scale on ALL middle east / greek food that i devour down when I need my gyro fix. 

Here, the customer services needs work, they need to be a bit more helpful and understanding when new customers come in. Yes, I'm familiar to this style of food, but not your menu setup and I need you to walk me through it. Sorry, it was a turn off for us when pressured to order faster. We walked in and no one was here yet. But as soon as we placed our order the place seemed to fill up quite fast. (Good timing on our part)

Food was just... just.. okay. A little dry, a little garlic-y, maybe this is the 'Chicago Style' ...not sure, but it was just okay in my book. Now don't get me wrong, I WILL return to give them another crack at it, as I sample a few other menu items, and will update my review as I go."}
{"text":"Yep! Very good! Gyro & chicken are very tasty! Tzatziki sauce is great!!!"}
{"text":"My go to whenever I need a great gyro. Looking forward to trying their falafel next time."}
{"text":"Pretty decent, actually more than decent for Arizona I guess.  Didn't even know that had decent Greek food, boy was I told wrong.   But if I was in So Cal, or LA/OC... this place would be a 1 or 2stars, however its Arizona.  I'm surprised they even had a greek family in the kitchen. 

This joint is small & its more like a quick bite place.  Great for lunch to go, lunch break eats, or chill joint to eat at with a friend.  Joint has only tables for two I think and not much seating, so maybe enough for 8 ppl total?


*Food: 
Fries: so my friend has to order fries everywhere she goes.  Funny thing, I wasn't expecting this place to even have decent fries.... they're fries are awesome!!! Definitely get that over the hummus

Hummus: don't get it or get if you aren't expecting much.  Its pretty grainy still and is a little plain .

Gyro: dude its huge!!! I'm serious, split it with two people & see if thats enough for you.  Unless you a very big guy, then go for it... you'll be full for sure.  Its a lot of meat even when its split into two... i mean alot of meat, like meat overload.  Be sure to get more sauce or put your hummus on it haha

Drink: Soda Fountain.  We got Raspberry Iced Tea.


*Service: None, but as for the cashier...which probably is the owner's daughter - she could be a little more pleasant?


*Parking: Its a plaza parking lot.  Theres enough parking, but you might not get a parking right in front of it.  Doesn't matter, its not much of a walk anyways, better than the grocery stores type of parking walk.


*Price: Decent.  Dude the Gyros are totally worth it though!!!"}
{"text":"The gyros here are so good that they forgot to put the sauce on mine and it still tasted amazing. I also loved the hummus served with warm pita bread. I am looking forward to trying other items off the menu on my next visit."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of food I guess I could say. I feel like the meals are definitely over-priced and could be a buck or two cheaper, especially for a meal ($10 bucks). I could go and have a full course dinner meal and appetizer  for two at Chili's ultimately for the same price I paid. 20.79 for 2 lunch meals. 

I asked for chili peppers to eat with my meal and a little extra Tzatziki sauce and they charged me for that. If they didn't do that and was a bit cheaper, I'd probably come back more often. It was good enough to come try it out atleast.

The interior is nice though, with wall decor, 2 tvs and some low playing music, mainly Maroon 5, lol, which was cool."}
{"text":"We came upon this place when we first moved into the area and we were looking for something new for dinner. Being a falafel girl, I figured I would give it a shot. I admit, I was a little scared of the exterior appearence, though in retrospect I'm not sure why othan the fact it's in a non-descript little street corner with a dive bar next to it. Regardless, the bottom line is that the food is very tasty. I've been twice, the first time I had the falafel and last time the chicken shwarma. I am in love with tzitki sauce and theirs is tasty, very cucumbery, so I always order an extra side. The atmosphere is quaint and extremely clean. I always promise to ignore my french fries but of course I end up mowing their salty goodness by the end. Love it!"}
{"text":"Love their food!!! Always fast and friendly service  I usually get the falafel pita which is amazing. I have also had the hummus and Greek salads which were both great! Highly recommend them"}
{"text":"Found this place on good ole Yelp. The reviews are right on point. Went for lunch and had the chicken pita with fries. Very delicious and they are generous with their portions. Plenty of chicken breast in the pita. The place is laid back and great vibe."}
{"text":"The girl taking my order could not possibly been sweeter and happier, which made for a great experience! My salad was great and the falafels AMAZING! 

The only pitfall... The pita sandwich was bland and lacked the gusto flavor I crave with Mediterranean food. When I asked for hot sauce, they wanted to charge me for it. I have NEVER been charged for hot sauce... That's a staple for this cuisine. Made me feel like the owners were trying to squeeze a few extra pennies out of me while the meal wasn't very cheap to begin with."}
{"text":"Yuck. Just ordered a chicken pita and it was completely tasteless and soggy. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Wanted gyro.
Read good things so I decided to drive a bit and try them out.
The gyro had lost of tasty meat and the tzatziki sauce actually has herbs in it that you can taste. Fries are very good too. 
Friendly service and the place is clean.
I will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, best gyros. It's not the closest place to home, but worth the drive. I first tried this place in 2012 and I was very impressed with the quality of their gyros. I still, to this day, stop by to get gyros. Their fries are also very good and crisp."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY. They accepted an order through grubhub,then canceled if an hour later with no notification to us. Terrible business, do not trust."}
{"text":"This place has some damn good gyros! Their gyro combo is less than $10 and is very filling. The combo comes with either fries or a small Greek salad. Plus, the baklava is rich and delicious!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered two #1's. The Gyros were HUGE and were served with a mountain of incredibly delicious French Fries! We would both recommend this place to anyone who is craving a Gyro!"}
{"text":"I'm use to my gyros with plenty of sauce & lettuce, however, this one met my expectations. The gyro was very meaty and tender, the manager came by and asked if my meal was good and I appreciated that, I'll definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"It was delicious!!!! I loved the grape leaves and beef and lamb platter. Can not wait to order from them again."}
{"text":"Great tzatziki. I usually get extra sauce for the fries. I was not disappointed. the meat was good, could have used a little browning. I'll ask for that next time. I will patronize this business again."}
{"text":"Best gyros in Phoenix. Place is great. Saw somewhere on yelp where someone said pita kitchen was good... they got nothing on this place!!!! I'll drive 20 miles to come here over some other gyro place."}
{"text":"I had driven past here before and wondered about it so after yelping yesterday I decided to pick it up for dinner at home. I got a chicago gyro \"as a wrap\" and a philly gyro ( just the sandwiches) and baba ghanoush for an appetiser for JD and I to share. We split everything and both thought the chicago gyro/wrap was the best but didnt think it qualified as enough for two, as the menu says. The baba was good but too smooth- I like it better with a courser texture- where you can see and taste the seeds on your tongue! All in all, we decided that we would be back again to try the gyro salad and the chicken gyro's."}
{"text":"Brought the family of four, my second visit as good if not better than first time. Two had Gyros, one kids,Chicken strips (Just awesome:, and i had \"Chicago\" style Vienna Hot Dog!...brought back such memories growing up in the Windy City. BEST Fries,Hands-down. Hot,Crispy on outside,potato perfect on inside, and Hugh servings, for all of us. Pricing a little high,but worth the value in the quality in the food,!...GOING BACK,Often!"}
{"text":"This is your typical quick service Greek menu, but is a real step up from the others around town. It's probably the food service gyros and such from the weekly delivery truck. As far as I can tell, the chicken is marinated in house. 

Great Tzatziki sauce and a deep menu."}
{"text":"Response to Rob C: I wasn't offered anything from any other restaurant. You got this review because I've eaten WAY better Greek than what you serve. You just trashed any chance you had of repeat business from me too, as I was -planning- to come back and try some more meat-oriented stuff as has been suggested. Incidentally, I could have sworn I wrote a review of Greek Wraps already, but looking through all the reviews (even the filtered ones) it seems I haven't. They obviously didn't pay me enough eh? (snort)"}
{"text":"Legitimately Awesome place!  I'm glad Yelp helped me find it! 

LOTS of variety in the menu, and I'll come back to explore more.  For today?  The Gyro was epic.  Gotta try it.  =)"}
{"text":"An average rating of three if taking into account the food, presentation, proportion, price and cleanliness. We spent about $35 for a family of four and the portions were meager. My kids got three chicken fingers in their order and it looked like maybe one breast filled was chopped to fulfill their entrees. The gyro meat was dry as was the sandwich. When we asked for an bit extra squirt of the Taztiki sauce, they wanted to charge us $.50. If you like things spicy, being your own hot sauce because they don't have any there. OR you can buy some their house hot sauce for $.50. 

The men's bathroom was gross as my husband said.  

Definitely not worth the prices! The portions are too small and food is just mediocre."}
{"text":"Really good. Tried this place today based on yelp reviews. I had the Philly cheesesteak and my hubby had the regular. Both really yummy and fresh. Best baklava ever! Fresh! Great customer service too. Very friendly guys working there! :-)"}
{"text":"The Chicago Gyro is served with the wallop of awesome dressing. Even though a big eater, I stretched this gyro and fries for 2 lunches. Their service is crisp and get you the food, provide a to go box - if necessary - and give their thanks. Love it. 

Looking forward to trying their Middle Eastern eats. Note: pay the buck extra and get the gyro with the salad. Fresh greens and nice size salad."}
{"text":"On Yelp it says they deliver but I called and they do not. This is an inconvenience when looking for a place to deliver. If u want to get your name out there at least make it the truth"}
{"text":"Both of my kids used to frequent this place and tonight we finally all went together and got take out for a group of people. Needless to say, it was a BIG hit!  We got the jalapeño hummus and regular hummus and both were delicious.  The pizza puff and fries were top notch. The gyros was delicious and the meat was so tender. The Greek salad and Greek gyros salad were spectacular.   The sauces were delicious and every single person was thrilled with their food.  This restaurant is now on my radar and I plan to be back many times!"}
{"text":"We went to Chicago Gyros - it was good the first time a few weeks ago, so we went again.  The food was good but they added an unauthorized tip amount to my bill that I noticed once the charge cleared my credit card.  That's not ok. I've disputed the charge with the credit card company and I will never go back to an establishment that steals from their customers."}
{"text":"They have the best gyros it the city.
I always get chicken shawarma, it's the best.

It's fresh and taste good.

Staff is friendly and always smiles."}
{"text":"Food is great, can't deny that. But great food is simply not enough. The customer service is lacking severely. Went there on a Thursday night with football playing and the cashier could barely take his off the TV to look at us for our order. Give me a break man, I love football as well but I can differentiate when I'm at work and when I'm not. Would like to say I'd be back but there are other of local places to give my money to."}
{"text":"I'm seeing the majority of these reviews as being 4 and 5 stars and I don't get it. Maybe I came in on an off day. I bought 2 chicago gyros and they were good but we're $12.50 which to me is kinda pricy. I also got a \"greek\" salad which was a medium portion of yellow greenish romaine a couple tomatoes 2 olives a few peppers and a sprinkling of feta. It was not appealing to look at and the dressing was not my thing just some oil and spices. That cost me 6.50  and bc I usually love house made dressings and thought I would need more, shelled out another $1 for 2 additional sides. All in all $21.66. Plus i left a $2 tip. I don't usually mind spending a little more for food that's really good but I wouldn't even rate this place closely to My Big Fat Greek. The second star is only bc the gyros were pretty good."}
{"text":"It was just what I was looking for. The meat was cooked perfectly, the pita warm and soft, and the tomato/onion were fresh. A simple gyro done well. (No lettuce, where the hell people get the idea to do lettuce on a gyro I don't know.) Had the joint all to myself on a Saturday afternoon. Watched the Fighting Ilini and relaxed. Keep up the great work. definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place on a whim.  They have two locations.  ordered 1 gyro combo to share just in case it wasnt that good... needless to say we ordered another one.  Super fast... super delish, pita was soft and squishy and fresh!  Meat was full of flavor and I cannot say enough about the taziki sauce... I know I didn't spell that correctly but it was darn good.  I could have used a little bit more of it though.  Fries were super yum.. they are the beer battered or battered fries... cooked to perfection and I enjoyed them thoroughly.  They have china mist passion fruit tea... yum... and I would suggest to anyone who is a gyro fan to give them a try.  I didnt try anything else on their menu and they have  many other choices."}
{"text":"The owners are fantastic!  Super friendly!  The Gyros are very good.  I would definitely come here again.  HUGE and the taziki sauce is yummy too!  Its all about the sauce!  Pitas were soft and squishy, just how I like them.  Keep it up Chicag Gyros...  I'm a fan!  I selected \"not good for groups\" only because the place is very small... not many tables and I think they are all two person tables..."}
{"text":"Best in town"}
{"text":"Fantastic gyros. And great price.  For 8.95 dollars (can't remember exact price) got gyro in a pita fries and soda. The gyros are delicious. Fries crispy and delicious.  I have been there twice this month so far. Love the gyros here.  I tried another place close by and they had really high ratings, but i was disappointed because this place, Chicago Gyros is soooo much better. I will be going back here again soon. I eat a mostly vegetarian diet, so this place has to be very very good for me to break my diet. Also, yelp and google said this place was closed last time, but i drove by and they were open. They just did not post their hours on yelp or google, so they say closed, but they are open. Call if unsure."}
{"text":"Wanted to try out this place since I also am from the Windy City. Place was nice and clean. Great customer service. I ordered the gyro sandwich of course! Couldn't wait to taste home. Well it wasn't Chicago, it was more Boise Idaho. It was not extremely bad, I ate most of it. I wouldn't go back and I would not recommend my loved ones. I would recommend you try it if your close to the location. Again nice place and nice people, but the gyros needs some revamping."}
{"text":"I finally made my way to Chicago Gyros and was perhaps expecting too much based off all the rave reviews on Yelp. I arrived late to avoid a crazy lunch crowd...to no avail. The place was still packed...at 1:45. I always think this is a good sign. The cashier was busy taking an enormous to-go order over the phone, which allowed me some time to review all the items on their extensive menu featuring Greek and Chicago favorites. Since I love both cuisines, I became overwhelmed. Chicago hot dog, gyro, hummus, pizza puff...oh my! 
Based off a Yelp review, I opted for a chicken gyro, and in lieu of fries, went for a salad (was taking it to go and thought the salad would travel better). 
The gyro was very good, well-seasoned and still hot by the time I got back to Desert Ridge. The veggies were fresh and complemented the meat well. I ordered extra tzatziki because I am a saucy minx (I kid!)...It reminded me of the gyro sauce I've had back in the Midwest: Chicago, Detroit and Columbus, Ohio. Very good, but also very Americanized.  
The Greek salad I had was OK. It was fresh and crunchy, but the dressing was just so-so. 
There are so many things on the menu that I'm eager to try, so I'll be back. But I may stick to the gyros at Eden's Grill. I think I like the middle eastern version better than the Greek/American. But That's just me!"}
{"text":"Great food that came quickly and inexpensively. Combo #1, the Gyro, was awesome.  Meat and sauce were perfect."}
{"text":"the worst owner is  nightmare horrible customer service  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  if you enjoy being abused you will love this place."}
{"text":"I was struck by two things when I went here to pick up a take out order: the inviting aesthetic inside the restaurant and the friendly customer service from the staff. The food was great too!  I've tried 3 types of gyros here and definitely plan to come back for more items from their menu."}
{"text":"I have tried many gyros in the valley and nothing compares to Chicago Gyros! I always find myself coming back. Great prices, good portions but most importantly, delicious! You won't be disappointed. Staffing is great too."}
{"text":"Pleasant service, family run and very good food. The gyro is HUGE. They give you enough fries for two people in a single order. Fries are real tasty as well (old school, crinkle cut). Very small inside, only a few tables, none bigger than a two top. The Chicago dog is also a winner or should I say weiner. Sorry, couldn't resist. Extensive menu that I plan on trying most of the items in the future. All in all a very good dining experience."}
{"text":"I came here because I recalled a review comparing it to Haji Baba in Tempe. I LOVE me some Haji Baba so I really hoped this place lived up to my lofty expectations as I live right down the street.  The only thing I'd say it really has in common is they both give you huge portions of gyro meat (btw, what do you call gyro meat if you don't put it on a gyro? Is it still called gyro meat? Or is there some existential crisis that would occur if you did not stuff it in a pita and cover it with tzaziki sauce? Ponder that for a minute.) with your order. As far as everything else, Chicago Gyros comes up a little short.

To start with, WHY oh WHY is it so hard for casual restaurants to learn how to properly operate a fountain drink machine. Can McDonalds please start offering some Lunch and Learns to these folks so that everyone can learn the optimum carbonation that turns Dr Pepper from prune flavored caramel syrup to the delightful nectar of the gods that it is? Because McDonalds gets it right EVERY time. Chicago Gyros, sadly, didn't.

Like I said before, the Gyro had a generous portion of \"gyro meat\", and the meat was pretty tasty, but it was lacking in the accoutrement that I prefer. Mainly, cheese. There wasn't any feta on my gyro! Is that not standard? If it's not it should be. I had to steal some from my salad, and salads can't really afford to get things stolen from them. They know they're on thin ice, taste-wise, as it is. 

It wasn't bad, and for $8 I won't complain too much, but It will probably be my second or third choice for Gyro's around.  Though I'll probably be back to check out the \"Chicago\" portion of their menu (hot dogs and shiz). I'll probably be hungover so hopefully they have their fountain machine fixed."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the meal we got for take-out on Sunday night. We ordered the gyros plate with a side salad and also an order of the Greek fries. Our bill was under $17. My husband and I split the food and it was more than enough (could have shared with a third person and still be satisfied). The meat was tender, the sauces tasted great, the fries were nice and crisp with a good sprinkle of cheese; I toss on the green olive oil type dressing onto the fries too. 
They do close early on Sunday's so be sure to order by 5:30 to beat the 6pm closing."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my meal , as my boyfriend loves it here. I ordered the grilled veggies and steak. The vegetables were not grilled, it was a frozen mix of broccoli, cauliflower, baby carrots and peppers. they were limp and water logged. Not what I was expecting, I thought generally, you get fresh veggies that have been on a grill. No signs..sorry, but yuck. I will give them another shot with another dish sometime..maybe veggies are just not their thing."}
{"text":"Been eating here sine 1990. Great gyros and food. You can even buy the cucumber sauce by itself if your making homemade lamb. The salads are great too. If your with someone that doesn't like lamb they serve chicken too."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Generous portions & consistently delicious! The staff are exceedingly friendly. If you like Gyros, you'll appreciate this place. Must try the Baklava! Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I sometimes stop here in the middle of my bike ride ending in Arcadia.  The food here is typical of a midwestern gyro joint.  I always have the gyro with fries.  It is tasty and reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is no frills, but the food is decent."}
{"text":"Thought it was really good.  Had the chicken pita and everything was fresh and flavorful.  The warm pita was really good and the chicken was well seasoned. Enjoyed eating on the patio. Would recommend it for lunch or casual dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious gyros and Italian beef! Staff is always friendly. Restaurant is always kept very neat and clean. Prices are decent. Tucked back into the Safeway plaza on the corner of Arcadia and Indian School...keep your eyes open for this gem :-)"}
{"text":"Love the people and the food.  Gyros are great. Frit's are perfect every time, hot and salty. Really good comfort food and the best Greek fast food in town"}
{"text":"I tasted my first gyro 31 years ago while in Chicago... Okay, technically it was Milwaukee, because we took a day trip out of the city. I may remember where I was, but I don't recall if it was any good. I had no point of reference. All I knew was, this strange meat on weird bread was pretty tasty.

Fast forward to present day. I've sampled gyros all over the place. Some in chains, others at Greek festivals, and a few at Chicago Gyros. My foodie co-workers (gotta think of a nick name for them) introduced me to this place a few months ago. It's not as close to the office as other places, but it's definitely worth the trip.

On this visit, I chose their signature Chicago Gyro (again) but selected the salad instead of the fries in the combo. The fries were good last time. However, the Greek salad was much better. It looked simple, but it was very tasty salad. And the portion was generous. The same can be said for the gyro. It was stuffed with beef and lamb, onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce. Simple and delicious. The meat was seasoned perfectly!

Chicago Gyros has an extensive selection of Greek entrees, and they even offer Chicago Dogs and Italian Beef! There are so many other options on the menu, that I am going to have to force myself out of my gyro rut. A few things caught my eye on the menu, from the Dolmas to the Spanakopita, or the Falafel and Hummus... Mmmmmm! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"After today's visit, I just promoted Chicago Gyros into the weekly lunch rotation. The food is excellent and the prices are reasonable and the dude at the counter keeps the line moving; I had the delicious Philly Cheese Steak wrapped in a gyro and topped with onions, greenpeppers and cheese (not that horid cheese whiz). Their gyros and greek salads are tasty as well.

Get there early because the place gets so crowded and tables are at a premium. It's like trying to cram 10 pounds of stuff into a 5 pound bag."}
{"text":"Really amazing food. It's in a strip mall, don't judge a book by its cover. I go here many times a month. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS DELICIOUS!!!

I can never find a good place for hummus and gyros...well I finally found it! They have a great menu, friendly staff, and clean restaurant.  
They give you large portions and the food just tastes great.

LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT....Go! You will not be sorry...and its cheap! 

One more time.... LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Tried this place again after such a negative experience last time. Hoped maybe as time passed they would have gotten rid of whatever horrible employee I dealt with on the phone last time...no such luck. Tried to order chicken shawerma no pita and still told can't do that...it's everything except the bread. Employee then asks the manager and he told him it's fine and explained how to ring it up. Employee proceeds to talk crap about me to the cook...right in front of me. Hope this business saves their apology email and actually gets rid of the man at the register. NEVER coming back"}
{"text":"Best gordita in the area! Phenomenal fries as well.  The location is great if you're anywhere near Deer Valley airport. The customer service is what you'd expected from a fast food place. It's fast, but its healthy. I recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is always consistent. I've tried other restaurants closer to my home but I keep coming back to this one.  It's a bit out of the way for me but worth it. If you're from Chicago, you'll like all of the prints on the wall.  They also have a couple of small tv's that usually have a sporting game on. 

Both the Chicken and Gyro is so good, pita is always fresh and tahini is perfect. 

Their Greek salad is refreshing, always fresh, crisp greens, fresh grape tomatoes and feta cheese. Their dressing is so good you'll want to drink it. ;)"}
{"text":"Great gyros, I eat here every week! They have a great lunch special, are very friendly, and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Guy was friendly, kinda pushy and was trying to sell me on chicken shawarma. Claiming I can't get it anywhere. I like chicken shawarma and had just recently made it. He insisted I try it. It was gnarly. Almost made me worried about my gyro.. but that turned out fine. I won't be back it was just a gyro nothing bad and nothing wow.  Tzazki was also passable just not wow! Fries were the best part, that could be because I love fries especially fresh hot ones."}
{"text":"Love the gyros and the souvlaki, plus the staff is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"This is difficult to give a star rating so I have to give a 3. The gyros are fantastic, as is the tzatziki but the spanikopita is horrid!!! It's like they just slapped together several pieces of filo and made it into a burrito and the spinach was extremely watery as well. They did not butter between the layers of filo to make it flakey as is should be traditionally."}
{"text":"Chicago Gyros in Phoenix Arizona

Chicago Gyros is a clean, pleasant, establishment with a professional friendly staff.

Today, was my first visit to Chicago Gyro, however, it won't be my last.  On this visit I had the Philly Gyro with Fries.  The fries were piping hot, crispy, well seasoned, and fresh.  I wasn't planing on eating all the fries, however, I did , the fries were delicious.

My Philly Gyro was equally goox.  The Pita was soft, fresh, and hot, and the serving of Gyros was more then generous. The beef was moist, as if it had just been shaved onto the pita.  I enjoyed the onions and peppers, which were on the sweet side, and not too strong to enjoy. 

The portions are generous, the prices are fair, and the customer service is great. If your ever in the area, you should give Chicago Gyros a try."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer of Chicago Gyros ever since they opened at the 7th ave location. They have always had tasty Gyro meat and excellent falafel.. Oh! And basmati rice.. Tonight I ordered a falafel sandwich with a side of onion rings (fantastic btw) and a side of basmati rice. Their falafel has always been super delicious- but I wanted to commend them on putting the tzaziki  sauce on the side for a take-out order(which they used to not do). It makes the pita so much less soggier! Thank you! Your guys' food is always excellent!"}
{"text":"\"Where's DA Beef?\" It's here at Chicago Gyros. The closest thing to windy city here in the Desert. Beef, chicken, souvlaki, gyros, it's all Da Bomb! Very clean, nice Chicago atmosphere,  it's like your on Clark getting a good full delicious meal. Save some room for baklava,  if you have any room left :)"}
{"text":"This place is ridic!!!!! I crave this place because it's that amazing. LOVE the chicken gyro. I do not eat lamb, but love gyros. So the fact that they have chicken gyro meat is awesome. A lot of other gyro places do not have chicken gyros, so kudos to them. The meat is always so flavorful and moist, just melts in your mouth. And their taziki sauce is by far the best out of all the places in the valley. Its always so light and creamy, with just the right amount of cucumber and dill. I always get extra to use as dipping sauce because I can't get enough. The portions are also some of the biggest out of all the other gyro places. I also love their fresh crisp Greek salad with their homemade Greek dressing. All in all this place is the best."}
{"text":"Great portion sizes for the price.  Buy one gyro or dinner plate here and you got food for 2 meals.  The food is decent, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  I come here mostly because its convenient.

Value = 3 stars
Taste = 2.5 stars
+1 star because they give a discount to students from Midwestern University"}
{"text":"We've been going here for several years and they just have the best gyros around.   The gyro salad is really tasty and generous.   When you get a hankering for delicious gyro, warm pita and killer fries, this is the place to park your carcas."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped here for lunch a few days back as we were in the neighborhood. We got there just before the lunch rush (11:30ish am) so everything came out really fast.

We both ordered the gyro combo. The meat was good, and generous portions of both meat and fries. The fries were really good... they were almost crispy and they had this really good taste, but didn't seem to be seasoned... 

My husband ordered extra tzatziki and I don't remember if they charged us for it... however, I think the bill was less of what the board said... not sure why.

Well, really good. It is kind of far but we will be  back when we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My latest favorite restaurant. Some of the best Greek food around and it's affordable. Plus, the staff are very nice and appreciative. Great!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food for a decent price. We usually order the #1 gyro plate. Comes with a bunch of yummy yellow rice, a Greek salad, a pita, cucumber sauce, and plenty of meat. Some of the best gyros in Phoenix. We order an extra sauce and pita because there's so much rice and meat, tab comes out to about $12. Plenty of quality food for the price. The only small gripe we have is sometimes the pitas are over cooked which makes the break a little easier than they should. All in all, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been ordering delivery from this place several times a week for months.  Now my first time in, I tried the #1 Chicago Gyro.  It was very good.  Taste was perfect,  Flavorful.  And the sauce was great.

I've been eating their hummus, baba ghanoush, and Greek Salad.  It tastes so fresh, delightful, and nice.  Some of the best in town."}
{"text":"Getting my craving fix. Jalepino hummus with chicken. The chicken is seasoned perfectly. A side of Taziki and olives. Comes with pita bread, cucumber and tomato slices. Soda, Life is good! $13 Good for lunch. Opens at 11am"}
{"text":"After paying $10 for a footlong Tuna and a drink at Subway (read the review), I was obligated to find new lunchtime stomping grounds. And I've found one. 

How someone is going to take points for \"ambiance\" in a Chicago style gyro eatery is worth my lolz. But, you're not going to a Chicgo style gyro eatery for \"ambiance\". You're going for good grub, and a bottomless drink cup. This place rocks for what it is. 

The decor is cool. I spent the vast majority of my meal staring at the posterboard sized photos of downtown Chicaga. I was lost and mezmerized at the fine details of the photos. I would bite, and stare. Bite, and stare. 

And there was much to bite on. This pita came STUFFED with succulent, tasty meat. I'm not a tomato fan, so I left those for those who are. My gyro was oozing sauce. I would take a bite, and while enjoying the deliciousness that permeated my over-stuffed mouth, contemplated what to do about the sauce on my fingers. KNOWING that if I dared to open my mouth, I'd be looking at the food I had just started to chew, but understanding that if I did nothing with the sauce it would drip off of my fingers into the basket. Quite the dilemma, I tell you. Bite, and stare.... Ooooh! Look! Fries! Mmmmmmm.... 

I was there at 11:30 on a Thursday, and it was less than crowded. Parking was no issue. 

All of this for less than $7. Yep. I'll take my $3, and give it to the bum on the street. Better than spent at Subway."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I just love their shawarma .
Staff friendly it nice.
I will definitely recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and worked at a gyros place for 3 years and let me tell you... This is THE best place in Phoenix greater area for gyros and Greek food. Everything is perfect and delicious and it's SO clean. The portions are big, and the taste of the gyros is exactly the way it should be. And as a side note, their fries are really crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. 100% Chicago Gyros fan!"}
{"text":"Gyro meat in general is usually pretty tasty. This tasted like bland beef. Philly meat was dried out like it was scorched in the microwave. Salad dressing tasted like plain oil.  This food needs some love."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! Try the Philly Pita and Fries or the chicken and rice meal with salad and pita. It is really good. The place is clean and the people super friendly.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Haven't had the Gyro's yet, maybe next time.

Really not a huge fan of their Italian beef. Not the traditional sweet peppers from Chicago. Portillo's has the best italian beef I've tried in AZ, and I'm on a quest for something closer to Glendale."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place! It's always consistant and delicious. Great quality!"}
{"text":"Food was good. I prefer other gyros from other places. I would go back again because they are very friendly and I probably could order something else and like it more. It was a good price for a filling healthy lunch."}
{"text":"I tend to check this place out somewhat regularly when craving fast food. The gyro, falafel, and schwarma sandwiches are great . 

The plates/platters offer pretty good proportions, which allow you to make your own wraps, and the Chicago style dog is filling and tastes fresh."}
{"text":"I came here with 7 family members and we all enjoyed our meals immensely! The portions are very generous and affordable. The staff was very polite and friendly. Chicago Gyros will definitely be one of our regular restaurant stops."}
{"text":"Ordered the hummus pita and Greek salad.  Pita was fully loaded and filling.  Hummus was tasty.  Everything came out fast, but was freshly made.  Romaine on the salad was crisp and had the right amount of dressing.  Bathroom was clean, as was the entire restaurant.  This is a family business and is run well.  Will be returning."}
{"text":"Dropping a star for the rushed feeling I received from the guy at the register. He was too busy pushing me through the line then to answer my questions in a nice way. 

The food was great as usual but service goes A LONG way, especially to people who have been visiting since you opened. :)"}
{"text":"Was visiting the area and felt like having a good tasting Gyro. Heard that this is the place to go. Got there and the place was empty. Hmmmm.... Should have probably left but stayed and ordered a beef/lamb Gyro plate with a side salad. Salad was awesome. Fresh and full of flavor. Gyro... Not so much. Sadly it was dry and lacking Gyro flavor. Not what I was hoping for. The search will continue in Phoenix for a good tasting Gyro."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best fast food Gyro's around. When I'm really hungry I hit the Mediterranean Plate that is sure to fill you up and the lunch special is also very filling and at a great price. This place is always busy but the service is always fast and spot on. I would say you should try it yourself you'll eat the often"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great service and awesome food! I usually get the steak pita and fries."}

{"text":"Great delicious food and service! This was my first time here and I was impressed.  Will return"}
{"text":"The Chicago gyro was pretty good as were the seasoned fries that accompanied as part of the combo. We also ordered the Philly beef pita which was fairly ordinary and somewhat lacking in meat. The DW had the beef platter and complained that it was entirely lacking flavour. So, the gyro was the best part and even then paled in comparison to nearby George's."}
{"text":"I swear to God, I always find the best eats right before I move far away. BEST eats.

This place is SO clean. I could probably eat off the floor. Small joint with framed photos of the Chicago cityscape, sports [THE BEARS.], and Al Capone. Hell yeah. 

We told the cheery girl at the register we were first-timers and she got a menu while apologizing for potentially smelling like onions [she had just finished lunch, haha]. So gave us a rundown of the whole menu real quickly and when my friend ordered the chicken gyro, she suggested she get the chicken shawarma gyro instead, adding it was made with a special in-house marinade. We also got the vegetarian platter [2 kinds of hummus, 3 dolmas, 2 pitas, 3 falafel] and I got a chicago gyro [beef and lamb mix] with fries. 

Can we say fast? Like, that food was fast. I didn't know where to start. I dug into the hummus and swooned like [90s] Tom Cruise just asked me to prom. I melted in my seat and the floodgates broke. Crushed the most delicious falafel I've ever had: delicate, hot, wonderful with tzaziki but great on its own. Destroyed my gyro, and as the onion and tomato fell off, I hustled to put them back on top [and I don't even like onion usually]. Fries had a seasoning that reminded me of Tony Cachere's with salt [or if you're from the NW, Johnny's] seasoning. MMM. Dolmas served cold and didn't taste canned. 

Heaven. CG is heaven."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken gyro and my boyfriend ordered an original one. Must say I am not typically a Gyro person but really enjoyed my food. Tasted the original Gyro and it was great.  Everything was fresh and seasoned very well. The french fries were fantastic ans the greek salad delicious. Highly recommend this place! P.S. Don't expect top notch service."}
{"text":"Pretty good but kind of pricy for what you get.  It's standard fare for a gyro joint.  I'd give 3.5 if Yelp would allow it."}
{"text":"Not often that my hubby and I BOTH enjoy our dinner.  My husband is a picky eater so we don't eat out much but we will certainly be back to Chicago Gyros.  Quick service and the food was very good."}
{"text":"I will keep my review simple.  This place has probably the best Gyro Sandwich in town.  The fries are just OK.  I have tried other items and they are also pretty good.  Worth checking out for sure!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I go here about once or twice ever 1-2 weeks. The owner always remembers me and my co-worker, is always super friendly and the food is absolutely delicious. The fries are crispy and very tasty, the gyros pita, chicken pita, hummus, just everything is so good and the pricing is decent too. I enjoy the atmosphere and there's a decent amount of seating inside. Just a great place!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Chicago Gyros for a late lunch today... I ordered a large Greek Salad to go.  And then while I was at it, I added on an order of hummus and an order of baba ghanoush.  I figured those would come in as handy appetizers since we had company tonight, and I was right!

The salad was fresh and tasty.  It was a decent sized portion of lettuce topped with tomatoes, onions, red pepper, cucumber, feta, pepperoncini, and kalamata olives.  Note that I said pepperoncini not pepperoncinis - sadly, there was only one!  I ate my entire salad along with some of the fresh pita they sent me home with...

And later tonight, I put out the hummus and baba and it worked out well too.  I was more a fan of the baba than the hummus, however.

I noticed that their menu is pretty large - you can order everything from salads and vegetarian wraps, to gyros, Mediterranean pitas, burgers, fish and chips, and pizza puffs.  They also do affordable catering.

While this place didn't wow me, it didn't turn me off either... I'm sure I'll be back - especially for the price, selection, and location."}
{"text":"Pros:
Good gyros,great Italian beef sandwich, salads, hummus, falafel, etc.
Large portions

Cons:
Prices seem to increase quite often (several takeout menus indicate this as well)
Man at register frequently acts unhappy/cranky even though I've been there quite often and am always pleasant; however the cooks/owners seem nice
I am not a fan of their salad dressing even though I like their salad otherwise.
I have tried some of their other offerings such as hot dog, fried shrimp, philly sandwich.  Underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a quick bite to-go on the way to the movies (spoiler alert - yes, i shoved the full bag of food into my purse and yes I am slightly ashamed yet slightly proud I pulled it off). I needed something fast that I could eat with my hands, that wouldn't make a ton of noise as I ate it. ;-) Having read the yelp reviews, I went with the gyro and wasn't disappointed. 

Solid gyro that I wouldn't hesitate to get again - tasty sauce, tender juicy meat, soft fluffy pita, not geasy. It melts in your mouth - a statement generally not applied to meat sandwich type foods! My fiance thinks it might be the best he's ever eaten. Fries were just ok. 

We just moved to the area, so I'm sure this will make it into my mental file of places to frequent. Plus being from Chicago, I'm a sucker for these types of places."}
{"text":"Great food, horribly slow service! Period... Takes 20 minutes to get a Gyro and fries when the place is not busy. I can't imagine how pissed people get when it is busy!"}
{"text":"Food is acceptable but not outstanding enough to overcome the service and lack of basic cleanliness. 

I have eaten here several times but will not return after today. They messed up my order and instead of apologizing and simply fixing the situation, the counter guy shifted the blame to me and was reluctant to remedy things. 

He was busy training someone new when he took my order and apparently did not hear me say \"no tomatoes.\" I am allergic to them when they are raw, I can't even get the juice on my tongue, and order EVERYTHING without them. He handed my plate back to the cook and jabbered away in a language I did not recognize, shaking his head the whole time. 

Maybe I would have been happy to wait for a replacement gyro but because the soda was all carbonation and all the tables and chairs I sat in were sticky, I was not inclined to stay.  The final nail was when he looked at his trainee as though I were a moron. I had to leave. I didn't even want my money back, I just needed to leave because I was so pissed off that nothing good would have come from further interaction. 

Fortunately there are other places really close by where the food is just as good and the service is never poor."}
{"text":"Great place to visit!  I would highly recommend trying it out...very clean, reasonable prices, friendly staff.  Food was better than average.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"DUUUUUUUUDEEE!! I thought I had found the best Greek spots, but oh boy was I in for a GREAT meal here.  I had the chicken schawarma salad, and it was great. PERFECTLY cooked chicken.  Pita was great, dressings were amazing.  I will be back as often as I can be!"}
{"text":"Gyros and a great selection of greek food.  All kinds of hummus and apps, a great chicken plate (includes fantastic salad and very good rice).  The decor is pretty basic, but they have a couple nicely located flat screens.  Always friendly staff and fair prices."}
{"text":"Wonderful chicken shwarma with a warm delicious pita. The tziziki is excellent! I'll definitely be back. The restaurant is very clean, ample parking."}
{"text":"Having lived in Chicago I can tell you..this place is the real deal..they even have Pizza Poofs!  I had the gyro platter.. gi-normous..very good!  I really wanted to try their baklava (it's double the size of other places)...but will have to wait until next time.  Reasonable prices, clean establishment, good customer service.  I recommend all around."}
{"text":"The gyros are really good, full of meat.   Also love the chicken Schwarma and rice.   My husband always gets the gyro with fries and I get the Italian Beef with rice.  And we split it all in half and have a buffet of food.  It's so good it's hard to choose so it works for us!"}
{"text":"Best gyros I've found in Phoenix, and thankfully, right around the corner."}
{"text":"What a fun place this is and I'm happy I found d it and will be back. You can get a healthy combo meal with a chicken pita or gyro and a salad that is full of great fresh produce for $10.25. I wanted to try the hummus and it was fantastic and a smidge over priced at $4.95 but it does come with two pitas and if split would be perfect starter fora group. 

Next time I'm getting Chicago beef and a hot dog and fries when I'm in a a not so healthy mood. ;-) And the homemade baklava looks fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food and quality. Great service. Good prices.

Meat was fresh and the bread was much better than Pita Jungle.

No A/C- so don't look to eat here in the summer."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times.  I go because I love gyros and they are a block from my house.  I would go more often, but they are not about service.   My skin crawls when I walk in the door because they are not too nice, but I am all smiles when I eat tasty food... at home.  I recommend all of their food, I also recommend you call it in, unless you don't mind staff who are not to friendly and a really long wait."}
{"text":"Been searching for good Greek in Phoenix.  I'm still searching. Was excited to see the white rice on the menu pics, but got served the yellow, which I only see in Phoenix. My chicken kabob has never seen a skewer (no holes). Taste was ok but oily.  And raw tomatoes instead of cooked skewered ones.  My search for great Greek continues."}
{"text":"Gyros were really yummy. Perfectly flavored and not too salty. The portions are more filling than they look."}
{"text":"Very good foot, great prices, and very clean restaurant!  Reminds of me of Chicago hot dog/gyro places."}
{"text":"Worst dinning experience ever! Customer service is absolutely terrible. The guy behind the counter is completely disrespectful! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mediterranean restaurant! The schwarma with garlic sauce was outstanding. The chicken gyro platter with yellow rice was terrific too. We ordered from door dash and it was here in under 30 minutes. This is take out at its best!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I think Greek pita beats them by just a little bit. Still great food and very filling!!!!"}
{"text":"We were in need of a little taste of home. After looking up Chicago style food spots Chicago Gyros came up. We were glad we found them. The Chicago style dog was good and my husband said his gyros  was also good. about 15 minutes away from our home but we will go again. We were told a few of the owner are from Chicago. yea go Cubs.."}
{"text":"It bothers me to no end that, in the nearly 6 years I've been coming to the Phoenix area every quarter that I never bothered to ask the folks at Chicago Gyros up in East Union Hills (yeah... the one way the heck up in Desert View) whether they had any other locations.  I guess I just assumed that they were shop kind of place and these amazing, delicious gyros would have to be a treat for when I was driving up by there.

Well... I finally found out they have other locations.  Like this one.  And the food is just as food.  Same perfectly seasoned lamb and beef gyro meat, served with onions and house tzatziki.  Same warm, thick, super soft, never stale pita.  Same slightly underwhelming fries that are probably okay to skip if you're not a fries kind of person.

I will say this location is smaller than the Union Hills locations, food is a bit slower to come up, and while I have no qualms about the service here, the folks I've encountered working at the other location regularly seem a lot friendlier.  At least much more personable.

The Chicago Gyro lunch special - with a self-serve soft drink and either fries or a salad will come out at under $8.  Still a great deal."}
{"text":"I discovered this place about 4 years ago.  In a non-descript strip mall behind a Shell station sits my favorite gyro shop anywhere.  Anywhere.  (I don't even live in Arizona.)

I know they have other things on their menu... I stick with the tried and true, because it's so delicious - a gryo pita and fries.  Okay, the fries - I could take 'em or leave 'em... they're nothing spectacular but always fried fresh and served super hot.

No... it's all about those gyros.  Perfect lamb-and-beef gyro meat, served with onions and the house tzatziki.  Cooling, refreshing house tzatziki.  All served on a thick, super soft, warm pita.  I can't emphasize enough how perfect the pitas are at Chicago Gyros.  They elevate the gyros and other sandwiches from great to fantastic.

Fair prices, reasonably fast, counter service (although they'll bring your order to your table).  If I can find any criticism, it would be that I spend most of my time in Arizona in south Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Tempe, so Chicago Gyros are kind of far away."}
{"text":"Heyyyyy! What up ChiCago Gyros?! So good with a twist. Loved the lamb and chicken gyros and we thought the pickle was a great touch! Warm, soft pita and fast, friendly service what's not to like? 
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Easy online menu and ordering application.  Better yet, accurate advertising of what's in store.  Both my furry little friend and I enjoyed the fast delivered, delicious food.  In fact, I'm about to order some more!"}
{"text":"The falafel are a bit dry sometimes but they have a good humus selection.  The service is good and food comes out rather timely.  It does remind me of a real gyro place you would find in Chicago.   It has a good vegetarian selection.  They also have a wide variety of dipping sauces.

Overall it is a good corner Mediterranean place."}
{"text":"I dropped in earlier today for gyro.  I was very quite pleased.  They put a nice amount of meet on the gyro.  The sauce was excellent.  The staff was helpful."}
{"text":"Initially this wasn't our 1st  choice as far as the location because the location on 59th Ave & the 101 was closed (not sure if both locations are affiliated) but, I had a serious hankering get for a gyro & fries....1st glance when the bring out the gyro & fries one may think that it won't be enough food but by the time You are licking your chops from all the flavorful tzakiki sauce you will be feeling pleasantly plump like it's time to stick a fork in ya 'cuz right about then...you would be done! 
...The ambiance was great, the service was great and the food was well worth the 5 stars...I would rather go here and get a good quality meal for the price of a total of $21.00 for 2 (my sweets and I both had the gyro special-gyro, fries and a med drink for 8.95+tax) rather than frequenting Mickey-Ds or Jack n'the Crack!"}
{"text":"Was hungry for a good gyro and remember  seeing this little place in a shopping plaza. Chicago gyro certainly wasn't  a disappointment.  I ordered  the basic traditional  gyro with the tzatiziki sauce and the gyro had a generous  portion of meat. I will definitely  be back."}
{"text":"Good gyros at first

bad aftertaste

really bad food  poisoning for two days after......dont suggest going here, find a nicer gyro store with better standards"}
{"text":"Every single time I go here for lunch I end up eating here for like a week long because the food is that good! AMAZING customer service!!! My go to gyro place hands down!"}
{"text":"We were passing by this Syrian-operated Greek restaurant, and decided to grab dinner due to their favorable ratings on Yelp. The horizontal interior started with the front counter sandwiched in-between two dinning areas. The clean, modern décor was appealing, but also a mismatch with the order first, seat yourself, fast food plastic plate protocol. The spacious layout was underutilized since majority of the foot traffic was for takeout orders.

Apparently, the young gentleman who took our order had his eyes glued to the TV. We asked specifically if they had a combo plate that comes with hummus, and he suggested we should order the hummus as a separate item.  Minutes later, we saw on the flash screen menu that they did have a Chicken and Hummus Plate ($9.25), but we were told the kitchen had already made our food, and it was too late to change our order.

The food still took some time to come after we had talked to the server. The Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus ($4.95) was smooth, creamy, and spread well on the warm spongy pita bread. To our disappointment, the hummus did not carry any heat or taste of jalapeno. The appetizer did not come as advertised, nor did it looked similar to the photo on the menu.

Souvlaki Plate ($9.95) the sliced pork loin was tender, and coupled nicely with the sharp onions and rice. Santi noticed the seasoning lacked oregano, so the flavors were flat and lacking complexity. Adding to our disappointment, the portions size was small for the price when compared to other nearby restaurants. 

Chicken Shawarma ($9.95) came in dark and white meat that was sliced too small. The flavor was lacking and the chicken was dry. Thankfully there was tzatziki to the rescue in an otherwise failed dish. Each of the main entrees also came with their delicious pita bread. They were not homemade, but I do recommend them.

Many similar restaurants offer a salad, hummus, or other sides as a part of the meal, but not here. The lone server at the register was mostly focused on the football game the entire time we were there. His lack of professionalism kicked into a higher gear when he told another customer in a disrespectful manner that he would have to pay for the same price by forfeiting his drink. Every phases of the meal was done in bad taste. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"picked up a carryout during the basketball games Saturday.  I've been meaning to try Chicago Gyros since i read reviews here; it's about 2 miles from home.  the gyros was HUGE, meaty, excellent pita and an extra order of tzatziki sauce made it perfect.  Didn't want a drink, because I had beer at home, so they took 10% off and the gyros & fries was $6.33.  And let me say just one word about the fries - WOW.  I asked for 'crispy' and that's just what I got - obviously hand cut (not crinkle-cut), fresh, perfectly cooked and probably the second best french fries I ever had in my life.
This place is going to be a regular destination for me;   can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  Oh yeah - the staff were so friendly and funny.  Just remember to say Ef-kharisto when you get your order (Greek for thank you)"}
{"text":"I mean, I thought it was okay. I wasn't wow'd by any means. I had the gyro pita, and it's honestly just mediocre. There was way too much meat (sometimes it's a bad thing!) in the sandwich, and the tomatoes tasted kind of old. The meat was also burnt at some parts."}
{"text":"Food was good. Hubby had the regular gyros sandwich and I got the grilled chicken plate. The chicken was flavorful and moist. I did enjoy my meal but I left thinking that the value for the plate wasn't very good. It came with lots of rice and side salad was extra. I suggest they half the rice portion and add a small side salad and maybe the garlic sauce or hummus. Otherwise the whole thing is not worth the ten bucks. 
I will be back but I won't be ordering a plate again. The sandwitches are just a better deal."}
{"text":"Love the vegetarian plate here, their hummus trio is some of the best hummus I've had in the Phoenix area.  Service is fast and friendly.  Everyone should go here!"}
{"text":"Food here is really good and the service is friendly and quick.  The little ol lady works in the neighborhood, so when I can join her for lunch, this is a much better alternative to McD's across the street.  Gyros are tasty and hot and fresh.  My biggest grip is that they fry their fish in the same fryer as their fries so the fries can have a hint of fish flavor on them, which isn't too bad but I don't eat seafood so it isn't too good either.  Simple and straightforward place.  You want good food at a good price and this place gives it to you."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but it's just not what I think of when I think gryos or Greek cuisine, even though the menu is mostly that plus apps like hummus. I find the chicken shawarma over-seasoned to the point I can't even taste the tzatziki on my pita. It is a good choice if you are simply looking for something chickeny and in a pita, which I am like 3 out of 5 days of the work week.

They have all kinds of other food here like burgers, dogs, fried stuff. I can't attest to any of it besides the fries which I think are really crisp and I love the seasoning. The portion is huge, good for sharing. They have Diet Dr Pepper on their fountain which is such a rarity I may have to go back just for that."}
{"text":"I think they offer best gyros of beef and chicken both in the valley. I always visit this place at least once a week. One of dish they offer is chicken gyros, which you don't find anywhere. Me and wife loves it."}
{"text":"I love this place, I really do. Every time I visit my bf from Flagstaff we have to go there. I love the gyro combo but here is a tip I have learned - order your gyro with a side of feta for 75 cents and it will rock your world. I also order an extra side of tzatziki sauce ( had to google how to spell that, whew) and a side of their HOT SAUCE. Get it, its amazing and hot and goes perfectly with the tzatziki sauce and fries. I am counting the days until I am back in Phoenix so I can go there."}
{"text":"Gyros are tough to rate. I am a firm believer that all gyro meat comes from one factory in the northeast. It really breaks down to what is served with them and how.

These guys make them right. Crispy,juicy, and overflowing out of the wrap. Served up with some delicious tzatiki. Fries are ok, they're fries. I tend to find that the gyro fills me. 

I've also had some of their other items. The Falafel is wonderful, and the vegetarian platter is also great. Super smoky baba ganoosh, garlicky hummus, it's all pretty great. I've even had their Chicago Dog, which was perfect.

The only negative with their food is that their chicken tends to be a little dry, and the service can sometimes seem like you're bothering them.

But whatever, give me that gyro."}
{"text":"I ordered the salad. It was good my but service was weak. Cashier was polite and the place was clean. Do your self a favor and go to Z's Greek. Down the street."}
{"text":"This place has tasty food - hence the 4 stars.
Is it mind blowing? No.  But for fast food, it is a four star option.

However, when I compare it to other greek-style places, it falls short in a few ways:

1) The condiments.  For starters, you do not get any.  Between myself and my husband, we could probably go through a gallon of tzatiki sauce in one meal.  He likes to drench his fries in it, I like to dress my salad with it...but all you get (per gyro) is one itty bitty sad little cup.  And if you want feta cheese?  Jalapenos? Olives? A side of ANYTHING?  You must pay.  It makes one feel a bit nickeled and dimed (although the condiments cost much more than a single nickel or dime or nickel and dime combined).  It even cost $.50 to add cucumber to your gyro.  That can buy an entire cucumber at the grocery store!

2) The french fries.  They are not bad fries per say, but they are bland.  They need some salt, or some garlic seasoning, or something.  I will add - they are not soggy and that is something I appreciate.  I hate soggy fries!!!  The other downside is that they are a small serving.  As a female, I often try to avoid greasy food to help counterbalance my ice cream intake, and instead I like to eat them off my husband's plate. Because if they come from my husband's plate, then they do not count as part of my meal. Right?  But this is hard to do when my husband is protecting a small reserve.

At the end of the day,when you add up all the condiments, a meal costs over $20.  And as I type this, my husband is in the kitchen eating chips out of the pantry, so the $20 did not even fill him up.

But was it tasty, yes.
We just needed more french fries and condiments."}
{"text":"This place wasn't the best I've had but not the worst either... Smells better than it taste coming in. The salad was pretty much flavorless to me , the chicken pita had a few big chunks of chicken and some cut up iceberg lettuce (nothing special) I would eat here again if the fam wanted to but probably not by myself or by choice."}
{"text":"The portions a very generous and the food is right in line with what you would expect from a small Gyro shop.  The sauce is surprisingly generic consider the two people working seem to be authentically Greek.  But their Fries are perfect for me!  Crispy and seasoned, so good.

The building is a dive but if your craving a gyro stop by."}
{"text":"Outstanding Gyro place.  Their combo is $7.25 and comes with a healthy serving of fries and a large soda.  Their roasted red pepper humus is very good and the pita bread is fresh.  The shop itself looks brand new and well stocked.  I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"good gyros, been getting gyros here for a few years now. Not the best but they are consistent and in the long run i feel like thats one of the most important parts of a food place

Would i come back? yes i have been for a year.

Have i found better places? yeah, but i live too far from it to go to consistently."}
{"text":"Our experience with Chicago Gyros started out a little bumpy but ended up amazing.

After all the rave Yelp reviews I decided to order takeout on a Friday night from Chicago Gyros. I called them. No answer. Hmmmm. I check the phone number and call again. No answer, it just rings and rings. I try calling twice more within 10 minutes. No answer. Any other place I would have given up and ordered somewhere else but I was stubborn and REALLY wanted to try this place. I see on their website they have an online ordering option. I place an order, type in my husband's credit card, click the \"ready as soon as possible\" option and we start our 10 minute drive there to pick up the food. He gets an email confirmation on the way there, so we assume everything is in order. Well...

I wait in the truck while he goes in to pick up the order. The place is only half full with about 2 people ahead of him in line. I see him talk to the girl at the counter and then come back to the truck with no food and a sour look on his face! He told me they didn't check the online orders and the girl suggested we call in our order instead. My husband explained that we tried calling. Grrrrrrr... 

So we wait 10 minutes in our truck for our order and my husband goes back in the pick up the food. The girl was very nice despite everything. He brings the food in the truck and the aroma hits my nose immediately and my stomach begins to growl.  

We dug into our hard earned food the moment we walked through the door. I had the vegetarian plate. Yummy! Such a good bargain for all you get. Good hummus and falafel. Amazing babaganoush (sp?). It was so garlicky and delicious. Ok dalmas. I split a side of cheesy fries with my husband. Holy crap they were good! You can't tell by looking at them, but they have amazing fries. My husband had the gyro wrap. It was enormous. He said it was very tasty. 

Their food is very good, better than some of the \"finer\" Mediterranean establishments. And much better value! So good I forgive the whole phone/ email order ordeal."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! I can't emphasize enough how good the gyros sandwich and the french fries is (MUST TRY). The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because 10 is not optional!!!"}
{"text":"A good one-stop shop if you're ravenously hungry during lunchtime and sick of five-dollar footlongs...

- falafel pita sandwich is worth noting...not bad, not bad at all! Comes loaded with three fresh/crispy falafels, hummus, and a side of tahini complimented with lettuce and tomatoes
- I've seen the classic gyros sandwich, it's as big as my body, chocked full of meat, enough to last you a whole week...or a couple of hours depending on your appetite..
- your eyes will be happy, lots of pictures of menu items for you to choose from

Hungry beware....
- order your food and take a nap because it takes LONG to come out
- don't come here with 20 of your friends because you won't find a place to sit...it's a teenie weenie (hence one-stop shop) joint and the tables are tiny hidden in the back, you're better off getting it to-go
- standard prices apply, but it's not bad for really fresh food"}
{"text":"Yes!!! This place has such good classic Greek food!! Plus plentiful vegetarian options!! The hummus is a must have. 383747/10 recommend :)"}
{"text":"This place has really great food and no nonsense service. I had a delicious gyro! I'll definitely be back! It's a little hard to see from the street. It's in the south east corner of Union Hills and 7th Ave."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here and if u like spicy..... get the spicy tzatziki with your gyro. We also had some chicken schwarma. Service was great and friendly. Food was great. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The absolute best chicken pita & fries. Perfect seasoning & the tzatziki is soooooo good I even dip my fries in it. We go at least once a week. Hubby gets gyro or steak pita & greek salad, both to die for  fast & friendly service & convenient location."}
{"text":"All foods are tasty and good portion sizes.  It may not be as good as other Greek/Gyros places, but it hits the spot every time I have cravings for it!  A very small place to eat-in, but great for take out or somewhere to stop for a quick bite.  It seems to be a family owned franchise and the owners are super friendly and nice!  10% discount for MWU students."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a sandwich for lunch. When paying for my food the guy offers me extra sauce and hot sauce to which I say no to both. I didn't know these were going to be extra. Most Greek places give you at least the hot sauce for free. Not here . They literally charge for hot sauce."}
{"text":"I got the chicken shawarma plate to go. It was pretty good. They separated everything out which was nice. The way they packaged the salad was impressive. It was a pretty nice salad that wasn't skimpy like many places. Good size too."}
{"text":"The BEST fries I've ever had - seriously, these guys know how to cook fries perfectly. Stopped in for a quick bite to eat whilst waiting for an appointment. Seriously good 'fast food' with great flavors. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for gyros in my neck of the woods.  I have been here dozens of times since they opened approximately five years ago and can't remember being disappointed any of the times.   I also love that fact that pretty much every time I go in there, something about the place is different, whether it is a new menu board, new tile, the coffee bar is gone, etc,.

I ordered my usual, the gyro meal.  As always, the gyro was stuffed full of meat and had great flavor.  Really good pita and tzatziki sauce too.  The fries...well, the one inconsistency about Chicago Gyros is that the fries sometimes are overcooked or not super-hot (could also be a side-effect of me taking the meal home most times).  That being said, they are pretty much always crispy and taste great, and once again I was not disappointed.

If I was ranking just on this visit alone, I'd probably give it 4.5 stars and round down, but since I have a solid history and bump up to 5 stars, because I know that I'll be back, and I know that it will be good."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a long time- 5 years or so. Always very pleased with the quality and quality of the gyros and sauce. 

But today  11-25-2013 I ordered one  to go with extra sauce on the side. The  gyro was about 2/3rd the size that it use to be. My friend and I would split it and not be able to finish it.  I had no sauce on it ,the order taker was very confused.

 Now for taste. It was dry, tasteless, no onion and could not finish the small 1/2- In the trash it went. Maybe new owner or cook, what ever I won't be back- a real loss- I liked going to small shops but they have lost my business

I will pay the price at My Big Fat Greek for a good Gyro-"}
{"text":"Went and had take out. From time to order to the time I was leaving was under 5 minutes. Ordered a gyro plate with rice. The lamb was excellent with a great flavor. Will be going back."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years! Love it! Here are my favorites:
-Chicago Gyros ( of course ) :)
-Chicken Gyros
-Chicken Plate (yum)
-Greek Salad with chicken (when your on a diet this is good dish to eat)

Also, their Tzatziki sauce is delicious and so is their hummus. 

If you've never been, go now! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We love this place! We can be in and out in under hour. The food is always delicious! I recommend the jalapeño cilantro hummus with chicken. My boyfriend usually orders the gyro combo.  Their fries are the greatest! Yumm!"}
{"text":"Food is great...  However if you phone in your order make sure you are calling the right location. Arcadia is a long ways from union hills"}
{"text":"We had this place cater my husband's birthday party.  The food was first rate and very well-priced.  Our friends raved about it all night long.

I did my homework and really shopped around for the best food, best service at the best price and Chicago's Gyros were hands-down the best choice for North-Central Phoenix.

Would not hesitate to hire them again to cater anything!"}
{"text":"My family loves eating here. Been going here since they opened. I usually get the gyro special. The prices tend to be a tad expensive, but willing to pay it. 

The only thing is that it seems to have switched owners.  The original owners I thought were all really nice and even the ones in the back would make conversation with customers from time to time. The lady that runs the register I like, but the 2-3 guys that work in back always seem mad.  Never have I seen them smile. Other than that, I like the place."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation from a neighbor since he said the gyros are huge here.  However, bigger is not necessarily better.  The meat was not very juicy or flavorful, kind of bland.  The gyro wasn't terrible but just not as good as Greek Wraps on 75 & Bell.  The location is OK, they have a tiny shop and it looks like a mom and pop place but only a few tables.  Not sure I would come back, didn't really excite me."}
{"text":"This was my first time here but I have always seen it when in the plaza. Boyfriend has been before and said it was awesome.

I had the steak and cheese with side salad and boyfriend had the gyro with fries. Both were awesome and the fries are my favorite kind. The place is small and wasn't packed but extremely clean. The service was nice and fast.

It was definitely fast food but good to have a different option than a chain. I would definitely go back and try other stuff on the menu since it all looked good."}
{"text":"Took my younger son and mother today and we all loved the gyros sandwich and fries. And everyone was happy. Delicious, not greasy, they put a lot of tzatziki sauce which tastes great and tomato and onions. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great! I swear my gyro weight at least half a pound. The beau liked his gyro plate and spanakopita, and my falafels were not overly cumbly or dry, just right. Everyone was so nice and happy to help! This is a place we will definitely be coming back to!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever the guy who took my order wasn't nice at all. No customer service and the food was defently not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely stellar when it comes to Greek/Mediterranean cuisine. I highly reconnect anything on their menu. Only place I stop for gyros in town."}
{"text":"This is our favorite gyro place...and we have tried plenty!  Not going to say it is the best in the world ( There was a little gyro shop in Friedberg Germany that will always be my #1!), but not sure any place in Phoenix beats it.

While this place is small and it is NOT fast food, these issues pale in comparison to how good the gyros are.  The generously loaded sandwich is way filling.  You use to be able to seem them slice the meat right off the rotisserie, but the kitchen is a little more closed in now. The pita is super soft and the mound of fries can be easily shared between 2-3 people. Tend to only get fries when we go with my kids.  The gyro is usually way more than enough

Would love to try other things on the menu someday, but we trek there just to have a gyro!"}
{"text":"The food tasted wonderful, and as a spinach LOVER the spanakopita was delicious, but I would have loved it even more if it was stuffed a bit more with spinach. I will definitely return for more. The cost was more then I am used to paying though."}
{"text":"Good food, good price good service. Best zatziki sauce around. I have many favorites.
Chicken pita, philly cheese steak, and the gyro just to name a few."}
{"text":"Good place, decent location,  GREAT food fast AR a GOOD price! Simple, Friendly, and a Successful establishment worth returning to. 4/5"}
{"text":"My daughter spotted this place on the way to her volleyball practice so when we were hungry afterward, it made perfect sense to try it.  WOW-WEE!!!  This is by far the most excellent gyro and fries I have ever tasted.  Their fries are sprinkled with this yummy seasoning and are cooked to the perfect texture-not floppy, not burned.  My taste buds thanked me all night!"}
{"text":"I love chicago dogs. They do them pretty good too. I love the gyros as well. never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"These guys are the closest thing I have had to chicago food since I moved here to the phoenix area. I really miss the Chicago places like Quickbite on Foster that have just good old fashion guys trying to make a living cooking amazing food! Chicago gyros has great gyros and chicago dogs! I stop by this place at least 2-3 times a month and really havent found a place nearly as good as this! I love the lamb meat and the fries!"}
{"text":"Ok after reading reviews I thought I would try it out..

The person taking orders was not very friendly and could use some customer service skills and kept looking at every women that walked in like a piece of meat... ok let's get to the food...

Its pretty tasty the meat was a little thinner then I liked but you got plenty of it along with frys and a side salad..over all it was good it wasn't the best I have ever had but I would stop in to have it again, I wouldn't make it a point to drive across town to do it again but if I was in the area I would."}
{"text":"-Outstanding food.

-Fries are truly addicting!

-Very inexpensive prices.

-Very clean.

-Questionable area.

-Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I have driven past here countless times and have seen the little, unassuming \"Gyros\" sign. I did not expect to be so delighted when I finally decided to try it out! It seems kind of shabby on the outside, but the food - man oh man! I had the hummus and chicken, and the chicken was so incredibly flavorful I was blown away. My husband had the gyro meal with well done fries. Get the fries well done. I had a bite of his gyro and it was the most flavorful gyro meat I have ever had. I like the style too, where you go up to the counter and order. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I have searched high and low for a place that serves gyro on a spit AND pizza puffs. (all you chicagoans know what I'm talking about!).  Very happy they are in my part of town.  Great place to go to the morning after a good night drinking..  they have coke products, which is a HUGE plus."}
{"text":"Did I like the place? Yes
Was it the best gyro I've ever had? No
Will I be back? Yes

Like most other restaurants in the valley it's in another dying strip mall.  So there's not much to say about its presence from the street.  However, while inside you would think it was full of life and not dull at all.  

The gyros aren't bad, but the tzatziki sauce was amazing I have to admit.  Don't know what they did with that sauce, but that alone will keep me coming back.  I also like their salads they offer with fresh looking ingredients and great tasting house dressing.

The decor has a nice Greek theme with a Chicago influence, who would have thought?  The restaurant is pretty clean, but a little cluttered in some areas.  Not a big complaint at all, just wish they would put things where they should be and not in plain site of the customers.

Definitely worth a visit if in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place for months and have been wanting to try the gyros. Well today I finely did...and am pissed I didn't stop in sooner!! This place was clean, friendly, and the food was great!!"}
{"text":"My friend Joan had her husband's birthday party catered by this joint.  All I have to say is AMAZING!!  They knocked it outta the park!  I am gluten free so I was happy that there were enough choices for me on the buffet.  I wasn't able to eat Pita but my hubs said it was good.  I did sample the hummus and Baba Ghanoush which were both spot on!  I used cukes and tomatoes to eat these amazing bites of flavor.  The earthy, smokiness of the Ghanoush was delectable and the hummus was silky and nutty.

The buffet also contained basmati rice (fluffy and flavorful), Dolmas (hubs said these were okay), salad that was very tasty and filled with veggies, falafel (little bits of heaven), steak and chicken shawarma (very, very flavorful !), Pita chips (looked great but I couldn't eat them ;0(,    TzaTziKi Sauce (perfectly seasoned!!) and black olives.

I've probably missed something but I have to say  that the choices were fresh and plentiful.  I was so impressed that these people have got a new customer!  Always looking for great food places and Joan said their pricing was extremely fair.

If you want a great twist with compliments from your guests at your next catered event I would totally call and check this place out!  WOW! She said they were wonderful to work with and THAT is hard to find these days!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I drive from scottsdale to glendale just to eat here. They're my go to Greek place."}
{"text":"Place your order, take a nap, and prepare to be underwhelmed. Chicago Gyros is what happens when you value quantity over quality. 

The menu is huge. That's totally cool when you're generally using the same ingredients again and again. But wait--they're getting a bit too ambitious. Greek burgers with feta and hummus? Philly cheese steaks? Please, you're trying too hard! Naturally I ordered the gyro, because there's no hope for you if you mess that up.

The wait times are looooong. It's not like I had my stopwatch with me, but this is definitely more time than one should wait for simple Greek food. It hovered around 20 minutes. And we (total of 3) were the only ones there. Don't get me wrong--I'm not too impatient when I'm dining somewhere for the first time. I like to assume someone's in the back eagerly carving the roast to impress a new customer. Call me spoiled. 

When I received the gyro, it was STUFFED. No way was I going to finish that AND the fries (which weren't good). But the meat was just mediocre. It was the most bland gyro I've had, as if the filling were carved in advance and cooked through some unorthodox method. Or maybe the seasoning is just off. I left stuffed, but couldn't shake the feeling that I wasted calories. I only get 3,000 a day! I have to spend them wisely!

If it comes between Chicago Gyros and more mainstream options for fast-casual dining, I'd give it a second chance. But if it's between this and other Greek kitchen, I wouldn't give other places a second thought."}
{"text":"This is a good place to pick up some gyros to go, or a relatively quick lunch.  Be aware that there is little seating available, maybe 20 seats at the most including a couple tables outside.  Stick with the gyros, I have tried a couple of different items, and the have all been extremely salty and overcooked.  One item that I have been told that is a chicago staple that is moderately hard to find that they have on the menu is a pizza puff"}
{"text":"Yes, the place is called Chicago GYROS...but I'm not going to review the gyros, because I didn't have a taste for gyros on my visit. I wanted a good Chicago hot dog, and I thought this was my best bet in Phoenix. 

As a born and raised Chicagoan, I must say - this ranks right up there with the best hot dogs I've had outside of Chicagoland. It took a bit of time for the food to come out, and it could have been a bit hotter, but I was here outside of the typical rush hours, so I would hope those issues would be gone during, say, the lunch rush. 

So, the hot dog was pretty darn good - everything tasted more or less how it should. Neon relish, peppers (which could have been spicier), pickle, mustard...and of course the poppyseed bun. The fries were average. The service was OK. The place was a bit run down but clean."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got a gyro and a gyro plate here and were less than impressed. To us, the meat was kinda bland and the pita was too chewy for us."}
{"text":"The fries are always freshly made and just cooked. The gyros meat just melts in your mouth. So succulent. There are actually 3 or 4 other gyros restaurants closer to me, but I will go out of my way and travel twice as long to go to Chicago"}
{"text":"So glad we moved back to the area and are close to this place again.   Love their hummus and dolmas and their falafel pita.  We went there when they were 15 min from closing and they were still very welcoming.   We try not to do that,  but didn't realize that they we closing so early!  Give this place a try,  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice little place. I'm not a big gyro fan but my wife likes them and thought that this place made really good ones.  I had the fried chicken strips and I thought that they were overdone, but they still had a good flavor.  Their fries were incredible.  

What I really liked about this place was how friendly and efficient the service was here.  We got good recommendations on the dishes that they serve and we were even thanked when we were ready to leave.  The facility is clean and attractive--overall a really great place to eat.  I will be coming back on my next visit to the Valley."}
{"text":"Alright, finally found a spot that knows what's up when it comes to gyros. Chicken shawarma is the dark horse favorite here. Everything is fresh, homemade, and kind to the taste buds. You can be a fatty there( like me) and gorge on multiple gyros and stacks of fries or keep it light with a chicken shawarma salad. This place is the go to spot from now on for me."}
{"text":"I was there earlier today and I tried their chicken shawrma and salad. The portion was perfect, lots of protein and the salad was delicious, also they were very quick. I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I love to support great little local businesses. Chicago Gyros has great food and the woman behind the counter is always nice. I usually get the Chicago Dog or Chicago Burger and both are awesome!!!! I've also had the steak salad and wow PROTEIN for days! They are very generous with the portion sizes. Awesome place I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Literally a strip of space in the complex but totally worth walking into. The food is clean, tastes fresh and satisfies every taste bud. I was very happy to be eating their food, couldn't stop talking about it even after I had finished. :)"}
{"text":"Chicago Gyros (717 West Union Hills Drive, Phoenix, AZ 85027) is one of my favorite Mediterranean Food eateries in Phoenix. Owners and Chicago natives, Robert Younadim and his brother, have been serving me their delicious menu entries for over 10 years at this location. I love everything about the newly-remodeled restaurant: the tasty and fresh food, creative interior decor, friendly staff, efficient service and clean facilities. My favorite menu items are the Chicken Plate, Mediterranean Chicken Salad and Baba Ghanouj Appetizer with Pita Bread. I highly recommend you check out this affordable experience!"}
{"text":"The salty yogurt drink REALLY is salty and the staff WILL give you the stink eye when you order a Chicago Dog minus the dog, but this place is amazing. Try the Grilled Veggie Wrap!"}
{"text":"Now if you're NOT a gyro lover, and you don't really like over-stuffed pitas, this really isn't your kinda place.  On the other hand, if you want honkin' gyros, loaded with that delicious melange of meat, sauce and fixin's, you NEED to give this place a shot!

Not only are these the biggest gryos I've had in the valley, but the pitas are perfectly soft and hot.  The tzatziki is awesome (though I order mine on the side so I can apply) and the french fries are always great too (but if you get them to go, they lose their crispy luster).  Hey, look - add a drink and you've got their gryo meal at a great price!  

You can always substitute a greek side salad for the fries if you're going lighter.  Their falafel pita is also good, and my choice about a third of the time, and their veggie plate makes my tummy happy too!  

I gotta give it to these guys, they give you great portions, good service, fair prices and even though I don't know their names, they recognize me from my repeat trips and welcome me with a \"How ya doin?\" every time!"}
{"text":"No more. the food was discusting. i had same meal at the same location before, no idea what change. i will never go there again ever"}
{"text":"Ima put it this way, you arent finding a fresher gyro.  The pita, the meat, the sauce.  Best in the area.  Even if you gotta drive 3 or 4 miles, definitely worth it.  Ive tried everywhere else and they just dont make em as big or as well as chicago gyros.  The owner is a stand up guy and they have frequent buyer cards that have great discounts on them.  

Not the cheapest but at $8-10 for a combo meal, you're not getting better food for the same price elsewhere.  Great atmosphere and good music, tv is always on the game or nfl network, maybe cnn sometimes.  Staff is really friendly and helpful.  Not \"really\" a sit down restaurant but plenty of room for 2-4 people(maybe 6 max)."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and they haven't disappointed me yet. Their traditional Chicago (lamb) gyros are what you expect it to taste like. The philly is delicious, and their chicken has this curry spice to it, which is decently good. I love the tzatziki sauce. 

Their plates are just a larger portion of the gyros with the pita on the side. I personally like all the ingredients already put together as a sandwich. The fries are typical fries. 

I like how it's a pretty cheap joint that hits any greek/mediterannean food craving that comes my way."}
{"text":"Easy 5 stars for this place! The food is AMAZING. Yummy yummy food. It's a cute small restaurant and the service is great. They've got super nice people working there and again, the food is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Love the Gyro and come often.  They know my order and their Gyro is perfect (I go light on the onions though).  Love the soft pita bread and the side salad is good, too (zesty dressing!).  I haven't tried anything else except the shawarma which I didn't care for, oh and the baklava (not so great, kinda soggy. mines better!).  Friendly staff and the place is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner a few nights ago.  Service was really fast.  Food was fresh and delicious.  Like other reviews say the sauce is unreal recommend asking for some extra on the side.  I got their gyro combo and will back soon for another."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time by wife's request. It was better than what I thought that it would be. Gyros were good and my wife's Mediterranean salad was actually pretty good too."}
{"text":"Great food! Enjoy the steak and hummus. One of our favorite spots for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I have eaten in the restaurant several times and was impressed with the food and service; so much so that I have been willing to pay the extra fees for delivery a couple of times. The Delivery was a little slow both times and they fries showed up cold. I don't expect great delivery from this type of place and I am not sure if they are using a third party service, if so I recommend they find a new service.

Updated 3/24/2016
I have since ordered delivery several times from Chicago Gyros and receive excellent service and food. They have also recently expanded there building which provides for a better atmosphere. I loved this place. Updated from 4 to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Attention all business owners:  Playing KYOT in your establishment may result in the automatic deduction of one star.  The aural assault of elevator music redux is an offensive to every fiber of my being.  It penetrates my ear balls and leaves me with a slight tic.  I am not the only person suffering from this affliction.  Consider yourself warned.

Other than blaring tunes to haunt my soul, the Chicago Gyro place is a rock solid choice for a mash up of Mediterranean and Chicago dawgs.  The menu is gimungous and really pretty intimidating.  Luckily I can keep chipping away at it by ordering something different each time, because the food really is pretty inexpensive.  It'll run you about six bucks for a gyro meal deal that comes with fries and a drink, and around eight for the gyro plate that comes with hummus and other deliciousness.  

My only beef, aside from the irrational hatred of Kaaay-Whhhy-Oooooh-Teeee smoooooth jaaaazz, is that the gyros are a little on the dry side and underdressed for my liking.  They are very generous with the meat here and the pitas are top notch, but they only slap, like, a single tomato slice down, and then load that madre up with onions and a tiny squirt of sauce along the bottom.  Now I appreciate a well packed gyro.  By all means, meat it up, but squirt a little of that shit on the top and side of the pita to lubricate my meat hole. (Don't go there.)  Cucumbers would also be a pleasant addition, sirs and madams. (Again, don't go there.)

Anyhoodle, I'm doling out a solid three stars.  You fill my tummy and leave me quite satisfied."}
{"text":"The best gyro's you can buy in Phoenix!!  Customer service here is exceptional, and the food is always amazing!!"}
{"text":"Well I was back to Chicago Gyros a few days ago - pulled up into the parking lot as always, and one of the owners walked outside and literally greeted me with open  arms like some old friend from grade school!

Gee, I guess he read my last yelp review mentioning the 80 cent chage for an extra Pita. He apologized about 10 times, and said that it is not their policy to be that tight and that as a longtime customer the yound clerk should have thrown in an extra pita. 

The food was great on this visit as always and these are good people here. They even sent me home with a delicious & flaky Baklava compliments of the house!"}
{"text":"I think this place is a great lunch spot. Ive been here many times and continue to rave about it to others. Everything on the menu is great, the service is friendly and for the price its a great value. The place has great food and its clean. Most gryo/hotdog joints have great food, but are filthy inside ie. Chicago Hamburger Company. I reccomend the gyro, which is the best in town, and the Chicago dog is wonderful as well. I love the crinkle cut fries and the greek salad is delicious. Wow i think i might head over there after im done typing. So glad this place is down the street from my office."}
{"text":"The gyro was the best I've had in Arizona. The meat is shaved right of the spindle and a generous portion no less. They then top it with a surprising amount of feta and lots of white onions and tzatziki sauce all on a soft and warm pita . The do an up charge for any extras like the cheese or sauce but that is to be expected and certainly don't mind.
The place is super casual and they bring your food out to you table which is a nice touch.     Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place hundreds of times and told myself I should drop in when I am in the mood for a Gyros. Frankly my degree of motivation to do so wasn't very high. Everything about it is a huge turnoff ... the look of the place, the location, the general feeling that this would be a place to go if you were in the mood to get food poisoning.  I'm glad my \"reasonable and logical\" side lost out today to my \"screw it, I want a Gyros and I want it now\" side, so we headed over.

Okay here's the point that I want so much to give this place a 1-star review and tell you to stay away for the very selfish reason that I don't want the place to get so wildly popular that some off the hook guy with spikey hair finds out about it and next thing you know the owner wants to make it all fancy and put a rooftop patio on it and start opening Chicago Gyros stores in Scottsdale and all kinds of other snooty places.  Because that would ruin it.

But my mama and George Washington told me never to tell a lie and I'm bound by honor and ethics to write an honest review. And the honest truth is, holy cow (er, lamb) this is one amazing hole in the wall restaurant!

First off, you walk in and the insides don't look anything like the outside.  No rats or cockroaches or anything like that. The place is huge compared to what I expected and clean and kinda funky fun.  Whereas I expected some transient-looking guy to be slicing Gyro meat off of a questionable looking slab onto semi-moldy pitas Chicago Gyros has an amazingly complete menu of Mediterranean inspired sandwiches and salads and stuff like Chicago Dogs, Italian Beef's and other Windy City specialties.  It was early afternoon on a weekday and the place had a (short) line of customers but orders were ready lickety-split.

Note that they're not cheap ... lunch for the two of us topped $25 before tip, which is about $24.95 more than the place looks like from the outside.  The Gyro meat was tender and flavorful and there was plenty of it. The pita thick and warm. The tzatziki fresh as were the tomato and onion slices.  The people who work there were friendly and laid-back.

So I've done a pretty poor job of keeping this place a secret I guess.  That's okay, as long as they don't screw it up and try to make it all fancy I will be back over and over, I can't wait to see if their Chicago Dogs are authentic (I bet they are) and put it on my short list of places to drop in whenever I'm running errands in the neighborhood.

A solid 5-star joint."}
{"text":"We love this place! We try to come whenever we can.. Coming from Chicago we were trying to find a place that serves gyros like back home... And we found it! Can't say much for the rest of the menu cause we only order gyros and fries but they are delicious!!"}
{"text":"They hardly give you any food when you purchase plate and there bias me and this guy got the same meal but he knew the ppl who worked there they give him more food"}
{"text":"This place is good and deserves a 3.5 stars but not quite enough to push it to 4 stars. The gyro was very big and tasty but was pretty plain. Contained meat, onion, tomato, and sauce. If you're looking for a quick tasty lunch, go here but i wouldn't say you should plan ahead to go here. Worth a try but not something i would go to on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Got takeout. Got food poisoning. Ended up in the ICU. If you value your life don't eat here."}
{"text":"This place is super yummy. Perfect for when I'm craving a Chicago hot dog. It's barely noticeable from the road but I was getting a pedicure in the same complex. The place is nicely remodeled on the inside. Great place for a fast work lunch. I look forward to returning. Love that they have Dr. Pepper and cheese for my fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered Gyro meal - Gyro is piled with tons of gyro meat, tazique & red onion. Fries come with the meal. They were also really tasty. Next time I'll sub greek salad. 
Husband ordered Steak Plate - This was incredible. The meat has a seasoning that you can't put your finger on. Its mouth watering. They do something to magical to the rice, its so good. Also, had a greek salad - dressing was fresh tasting, really light and lemony, which I really liked. 
Overall, I'm in love."}
{"text":"I tried to call for to go order and line was fast busy. Drove to place ordered from front counter. Told him about calling in. He said I shut it down for the night. 
I'm not the owner  I don't care"}
{"text":"Located in a seedy looking strip of shops behind a gas station, it can be easy to miss. Now this place is one of my new favorites. I love the flavorful tzatziki, a nice dill flavor with garlic and cucumber....wow.  The gyros....fresh soft thick pitas, overstuffed with meat...mmmmm.  I also tried their veggie appetizer variety which I really enjoyed.  Unfortunately I carried out my meal becasue they forgot the pitas that accompanied the appetizer variety. (Didn't figure it out till I got home.) I definitely will be going back!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken schwarma and a starter of hummus.  They have the best pitas.  To die for!  The hummus was perfect.  The schwarma was well seasoned and delicious!  The salad fresh and crunchy.  The rice fluffy and flavorful.  We'll definitely be coming back here again. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the prices are a bit high for a casual restaurant where you order and pick-up from the counter.  But, otherwise, this is a nice  restaurant and I'm glad we gave it a try."}
{"text":"Not bad gyro, but there's better. I like mine with crushed peppers and they didn't have any. Overall it's ok."}
{"text":"Normally my family and I patron the restaurant and the food is tasty. However, when I decided to order delivery my daughter was missing her drink and we never received the 2 litres AZ well.
When I called the restaurant, they told me it was their mistake and the employee didn't know how to credit my card for a refund.
I asked for a supervisor and was told there is none!
I finally pestered them enough for a refund of the missing items that I was billed for. Three days after the three phone calls."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Mediterranean Salad is delicious and plentiful. Fresh, fast. Can't wait to try some of their other menu items"}
{"text":"Now after a few years I am not getting the same thing every time I go in. They have a huge menu and everything new I have tried I have found delicious - and huge portions. It has to be one of the most efficient restaurants anywhere."}
{"text":"This place doesn't want to make your call in order till you arrive at the restaurant because they say waiting is free. Don't go here unless you have 15min to waste."}
{"text":"Love this little mom and pop restaurant!

The gyros, falafel, and chicken shwarma are all very good. Veggie plate is pretty impressive too, comes with a little bit of everything. The portions are HUGE (I can split it into 3 meals but I'm also a girl) and I love the way they dress the pita with all the sauces and toppings. Beware: if you hate raw onions make sure you tell them! I love  onions with my gyro so its no problemo for me.  The falafel isn't dry and goes well with the garlic dipping sauce ( sauce almost has the consistency of hummus). Get an extra side of this, worth the 50 or 60 cents. 

Also had the chicago dog and it was delicious. Keep in mind I've never tried the real thing so I don't have a comparison but it was tasty nonetheless. Skip on the chili cheese fries, you can go to Del Taco for that. 

Other things to note:
There is very little space to sit and it's kind of cramped so you may want your order to go.

{"text":"This place is absolutely heaven in my mouth.  Everything I've tried is delicious!  The chicken is some of the best marinated chicken I've ever had; I never liked tzatziki before I had it here (their's is the best!); their fries are deliciously seasoned...mmmm, just talking about it makes my mouth water.  The staff is always friendly and the food is always fresh.  My husband and I eat here on a regular basis and have never been disappointed.  Way to go, Chicago Gyros!  I love your food."}
{"text":"I pick up a Gyro with fries at least once a week.  Service is always super friendly, food is ready fast and I'm a huge fan of Gyro & fries.  I don't know what they do different with the fries,  hint of a spice but they are some of the best I've had.  Gyro is big enough that I get a second pita and get two servings.  I like this so much I get it every time but assume everything they do is equally tasty.  Oh and that small craft beer next door is a sweet bonus!  This is my favorite Gyro in phoenix so far."}
{"text":"I dug it, but I'm not gushing out stars like gametes, here, as some...

Well, even if you're not a gyro lover, Chicago Gyros still has plenty to make you full and happy.

The falafel sandwich and big mound of fries stuffed into the lunch basket was filling and cooked just right.
My tiny taste of the heavily seasoned chicken gyro meat, i think it was, left me craving more of the savory flavor.

The owner cooks up fresh hot food even late night after the restaurant closes for patrons of the Poker Union http://www.yelp.com/biz/poker-union-phoenix#hrid:IooN-FXYZ_TDj3B8iHptoA
Cool!"}
{"text":"Have been going to Chicago Gyros for many years; however, last visit was about 6 months ago. My go to favorite has always been the Chicago Gyro with either a Greek side salad or fries. 

The pita bread is baked fresh and the Gyro meat is perfectly seasoned and tender. The Gyro  has ample portions and all fresh. The fries have a very nice crunch and are not overly seasoned. 

The prices are reasonable. Their combination plates include fries and a drink. Over time prices have increased but so has the product costs.

On occassion I have had things missing from take out orders but you should check your order before leaving with any take out. I have never had an order delivered."}
{"text":"They cut the gyro meat really thin and load it up. 

Fries are delicious and the to-go order had a huge bag of them."}
{"text":"Chicago gyro combo. Salad and iced tea. 10 bucks. 
Euro was loaded, The salad was the perfect size. Came out quick! 
Highly recommend if you're in the area-delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the service is wonderful. Very friendly and accommodating staff"}
{"text":"Love the steak shawarma and first of all love their consistency I've been coming here for the last 7 years and is always good never disappoints..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the gyro salad here. Doing low carb and this salad is something I look forward to at least once a week. The service is great and I feel welcome when I walk in."}
{"text":"Total fan!

Checked this place out when I was visiting my man in Phoenix. Saw it every time we drove by - but not going to lie - pretty hesitant because 1) I'm a Chicagoan and 2) best friend's Greek, I can definitely tell what's good Greek, great Greek and Greek gone wrong,

We hit the place around lunch time, so it wasn't too crowded. Guy behind the counter was on it from the get-go. Really helpful and suggested that we go with the #1 because that's what they're known for. We ordered two #1 - Gyros, fries & drink - along w/ an order of spanakopita and extra tzatziki (per all the Yelp recommendations). Here's the breakdown:

-Gyros: Delish! Just the right amount of meat, tomatoes, onions and tzatziki. Pita was thick and fluffy. Meat was super tasty.
-Fries: Seriously, Greeks know their fries. Perfectly crispy, but meaty on the inside. I've never had bad fries from any Greek restaurant. Bonus: they give you a ton of fries!
-Tzatziki: Total must if you love the sauce. I put it on everything. It did have a little more dill than my man cared for, but really that just means more sauce for me! :)
-Spanakopita: This was ok. I was expecting more a flaky, buttery phyllo dough crust, but it turned out to be more of a deep fried hot pocket with feta & spinach. The filling was delicious and tasty plating it with tomatoes, cucumbers and feta cubes though.

Definitely going to hit this place next time I'm in town. So many other things I want to try: steak shawarma wrap, Chicago dog, baba ghanoush, hummus, dolmas... the list can go on and on!"}
{"text":"This is a clean, pleasant, establishment with professional friendly service, large portions, and good solid execution of its menu. 

I had the #1, Gyros and Fries. I loved how hot and crispy their fries were. I didn't mean to eat as many of them as I did, but they were delicious. I think they were coated with batter or something before they were fried. They came out piping hot. 

My sandwich was excellent. The Pita was fresh and hot, and the serving of Gyros was generous, and moist, as if it had just been shaved onto the pita. I enjoyed the onions, which were on the sweet side, and not too strong to enjoy. The sliced tomatoes were fresh, and the Tzatziki, while not the best I had ever had, was good enough and plentiful. The portions were so generous that I couldn't finish the fries or the sandwich, although I tried.

I think that next time I will try their Chicago Style Hot Dog, which is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the chicken shawarma. Flavor of chicken was great but I asked for no tomatoes and there was literally a pickle on it.  No onion, no feta, no pepperocini, no lettuce....nothing. just a pickle. The tzatziki sauce was on the side but no real cucumber flavor. The pita was nice and soft and the fries were....fries. The guy at the counter was very nice as well. I'd give this another shot but not for this sandwich."}
{"text":"Not bad but a bit pricey for what you receive. Gyro was tasty but could have used a bit more meat. I thought Chicago anything was loaded up? Especially for the price. Fries could have been crispier too. Compared tho what I've gotten at other  Gyro shops , this meal combo should have been $6-7, not $9-10.

Place was clean and staff friendly definiely a plus."}
{"text":"One of the few valley places that actually reminds me of the Gyro places in the Chicago area when I lived there.  Hummus selection is very good and tasty, falafel are flavorful but not too oily, and entrees are displayed well for what is really a fast food place.

Friendly service is a nice plus as well.  Drawbacks are the lines this place can garner during the weekday lunch rush and pricing seems a little high for what it is.  Also, it's not exactly a nice area, especially the strip mall with all of the signs to sell your gold."}
{"text":"Decent Gryros, falafel, and miscellaneous Chicago favorites are served up here in this narrow location in a strip mall on the NW corner of 59th Ave. and Beardsley/101.  Prices are a little high for what you get, and the new picture menu is a little obnoxious to me because it takes so long to find what I want.  I guess the newb customers don't know what the menu items are by name, so they had to create this huge pictoral menu as if their customer base is illiterate.

Food can take a long time even when they're not busy.  There's often no seating whatsoever.  If you have extra time on your hands and don't mind the wait, then give them a try.  Chicken gyro is reportedly good (many family members) but I prefer the falafel.  Hummus is just ok.  Fries are alright."}
{"text":"Excellent food the portions are huge !!!!!!! Really enjoyed my meal. Salads awesome the gyro meet is great !!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a casual place for all your hummus, greek salad, gyro and souvlaki needs? Chicago Gyro is it. The atmosphere is casual--think plastic trays and forks, napkins at your table, counter service and lots of styrofoam takeout. But what ya get what ya pay for at this joint. The pita is fresh and plentiful, the hummus creamy with just a dollop of oil and some kalamata olives. The gyro salad is the perfect balance between naughty nice and the staff is friendly. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great gyro. I hate here a few months ago and really enjoyed the food. Good flavor, good prices. Clean restaurant and friendly service. I will definitely be bacj."}
{"text":"Great guys and the food was delicious. Chicken Shawarma was fantastic with hummus on it, try it. The garlic dressing is a must."}
{"text":"The food is great but that Sarah chick behind the counter isn't very bright. I asked for the gyros combo w/onions on the side. She said I couldn't have onions on the side unless I was getting the gyros plate, which incl the salad not fries and soda. She was adamant that I couldn't have onions on the side.
Being from Chicago, this is NOT a Chicago thing. The food is always great though."}
