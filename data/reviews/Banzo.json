{"text":"Banzo is now my favorite place to eat the deep fried cauliflower was excellent also had lamb , French fries , and many more things and they were all great!"}
{"text":"Great \"Indie\" feeling Falafel house! We had the F-Bomb (in Pita form) and the Big Green Salad (classic, w/ 3 falafels) and they were both FANTASTIC, even a little too big on the portion side! The music, seating, ambiance, and most importantly, the FOOD were spot on for a great dining experience and delicious falafels!

Pros:
+Great flavor, freshness, and quality to the food. The falafels are really top notch. Some of the best I've had in 4 continents, and truly, they are what they're made out to be-TASTY!
+Really chill music playlist that helped add to the ambiance and environment
+Nice decorations downstairs, with oriental rugs and paintings.
+Chalk hand-written menu on an ordering wall is always fun.

Cons:

-It can get quite loud inside, in the downstairs area even with minimal customers (due to poor acoustics?).

-Free water dispensers aren't filled with ice and aren't very chilled

-The Tahini sauce is not particularly flavorful, but the chili sauce you can serve yourself definitely helps bring out its flavor if you mix the two!

OVERALL:

You can't go wrong going here...I hesitate to recommend it completely just so it doesn't get too busy and inaccessible (for me), but really, it's pretty great and the negatives are really minor things that may not bug you, so give it a try!"}
{"text":"When I was in grad school, I used to frequent Mediterranean Cafe on State.  Their shwarma sandwiches are killer.  Anyway, they are only open for lunch, so working in Sun Prairie prevents me from getting there with any regularity these days.  

My fiance and I had heard about Banzo, so we gave it a whirl on Saturday.  A few things:

1. I had the F-Bomb and it did not disappoint.  Combo of falafel and chicken was well balanced and flavorful.
2.  We had a side order of pita and hummus.  Also very good.  
3.  We took our order to-go.  The service was snappy and we had some ice cold cucumber flavored water while we waited.  

This will definitely be a \"go to\" spot for us in the future!"}
{"text":"Banzo is the best for many reasons, but consider this:  how many times have you eaten eggplant in a restaurant and it was gooey and soft with a chewy skin?  How many times have you never noticed the eggplant in a dish because it melts away, leaving only the tough, over-ripe and under-cooked skin?  Yes, I agree.  Too many times.  Leave those bad memories behind and eat at Banzo!  Their eggplant is always delicious, structurally intact, and flavorful.  

They are great for vegetarians, vegans, GF, and anyone who loves delicious food."}
{"text":"Would rather eat an item from the hotdog roller at Kwik Trip.

Based on the great reviews this place received we ventured off the beaten path to experience this place...I'm sure my negative experience is an anomaly.

Pros
- The Kombucha and Turkish iced coffee were great. 
- Naan for the Hummus was excellent
- Warm treating at the front
- Falafel was really good! Probably some of the best I've had
- would totally get the Banzo again


Cons
- Chicken Sharma, dry and flavorless
- Schnitzel, dry, hard as a rock
- lentil soup, bland
- Hummus, meh
- $72 after tip???
- bus my own table?
- fill my own water?


In the end, I won't come back. I'm sure this was just one of those bad days for them. The place was full of peeps that obviously enjoy the food...unfortunately, my food left me wanting."}
{"text":"If I worked in an office that was close to this food cart I would do anything I could to get in line at 8 in the morning to be the first person to enjoy a piping hot falafel at lunch time. My boss probably wouldn't appreciate that but I would buy a falafel for him as well. 

I guess what I'm saying is that this is a great falafel and I'd like to eat one right now."}
{"text":"Okay, this is complicated, the food is amazing!
Mainly the hummus, falafel, pita, salad.

It is truly a great place, the best food in Madison.

Here's the problem with Banzo, inconsistency.

Yep, overall great, but on occasions, too many now, food which we order does not have the same recipe as usual, it's not a matter of being slightly off, it's a matter of tasting completely different than before, are they testing their recipes at random?
If so they need to stop it.
We go back to get the same awesome food every time it needs to taste the same, because that's how restaurants work, you have a winning recipe, you stick with it and never deviate, ffs.

This has happened 2 times with the chicken that comes in the F-Bomb.
Their usually awesome rice changes too, the balance of the spices are not right, this has happened 4 times.
The salad also sometimes is not right.
Falafel is sometimes overcooked
And finally sometimes we get the home-made potato chips and other times they are non-existent , about 50/50, seems like it's a bonus prize sometimes if you are especially deserving. But I thought it was supposed to be always included, oh well, bummer.

So that's all weird stuff, they have great products (food/recipes), they need to maintain their quality control, perhaps the people making the food (chefs?) aren't up to par?

Not sure, but we will go back and cross our fingers, if it wasn't for the fact that all the other food in Madison is pretty much crap, Banzo might not taste so awesome, not sure anymore, it's hard to judge in such a culinary void.

Come on Banzo we're rooting for you!"}
{"text":"Very good, mostly inexpensive Mediterranean food. Compares well with some of my favorite Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurants in Chicago (though a few of those still hold an edge). Definitely my favorite falafel and hummus in Madison. I've had several of the entree options in various forms (on a plate, in a pita) and they're all delicious. They have about half a dozen solid craft beers to choose from.

A few things aren't stellar. Side orders are expensive for a pretty small portion. Like, you pay $4 for what seems like about 3/4 cup of rice or couscous. Also, I've eaten there at least 20 times by now, and I almost always have my order taken by the same few people, but they clearly still have no memory of me (or just don't show it). After a while, this kind of makes a guy feel unimportant."}
{"text":"This place is the best in mad city by far. As good as falafel at sultans market. Very fine cut, tasty salads. As a vegan, this place satisfies every time with plenty of side dishes and main entrees available. 
In the desert oasis of the citys north side, this place is a gods send! Love the owners and food carts too."}
{"text":"The food is stellar BUT the customer service is not friendly or accommodating! I had a catering order for my office, with various special requests, and the person I spoke with was quite irritated and terse with me. I don't appreciate when I am bringing a sizable amount of business and I am treated like an inconvenience...I would advise thinking twice before ordering catering from here - unless you enjoy delicious food with service that leaves a bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"On the plus side, the sangria was good.  On the negative side, the food was pretty blah.  It wasn't overtly bad, which I guess is a big accomplishment for the area, but, it really didn't have much in the way of flavor - certainly nothing memorable.  In general, the cooking staff could learn how to properly prepare a meal with salt.  I know there's this big health kick about low-sodium diets.  But, just like the cholesterol hypothesis and the low-fat diet lie, it will be eventually overturned.  In the meantime, we have to suffer with food that's just plain bland.  You know what salt does?  It makes food taste good.  Use it - especially in starchy dishes.  

The shawarma was not tender, and seemed more of a rub than a marinade.  The shish kabob was, as noted before, saltless and bland.  The falafel had great texture - very nice golden brown, light, crispy outside - but again, where the hell is the salt?  The rice (again, almost completely saltless) had no flavor other than what one might call \"lentil dirt\".  The tabouli was nothing more than chopped parsley sprinkled with bulgar - no salt, no lemon, no mint - it was a complete fail.  The salad was fine - the ingredients were at least very fresh.  But, those ingredients were very recognizable as a pre-mixed salad pack.  I have no idea what the salad dressing was, as I couldn't taste it.  Some kind of oil?  Beats me... 

There were just no bold, striking flavors, which should be present in Mediterranean/middle eastern food .  In the end, the food seems like it was from a moderately high-end buffet (is there such a thing?), and, while not bad, was very overpriced for food that was essentially not \"cooked\", but rather, \"assembled\"."}
{"text":"Aaron, in response to your previous comment, green-coloured falafel are NOT AUTHENTIC falafel. I lived for 25 years in different middle eastern countries and know what authentic falafel should taste (and look) like. Just for your attitude, I updated my 2 star rating for a 1 star which might be just perfect... Oh, and don't get me started on the  hummus..."}
{"text":"Holy hummus!  This place was great.  Everything we ordered was fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Banzo is mouth watering delicious. I've tried both the Banzo (falafel) and the Harvest (falafel with grilled eggplant) as a pita sandwich as in the platter form. The platter comes with a tasty salad, rice, and a generous side of hummus. So good! I also love the hot sauce and the pickle relish that comes in the pita sandwiches. When I saw the Banzo sign outside of their Sherman Avenue location (near where I live) I did a happy dance. I literally started dancing by myself. That's how good it is!"}
{"text":"The food at Banzo is amazing and the staff is so friendly. They have overtime, started to recognize me and my order.  The only downside, is when the weather is nice and it's lunch hour it can get a little slow and you can be waiting in line for awhile. Well worth the wait though the food is great!"}
{"text":"Good food not too authentic ,still searching for an authentic middle eastern restaurant in Madison .
Slow service even though they were less busy ."}
{"text":"Have only dined at the food cart downtown.  I love falafel and used to make my own but now I only eat Banzo and have seriously had to try not to do it every day. Great food and service for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Their falafel is great, love the outdoor seating at the Sherman Road location, but most of my Banzo interaction is with the food cart on the capitol square."}
{"text":"Excellent falafel! The hummus is homemade and tasty. Best place to get a good falafel pita sandwich.  Love the outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Great place for vegetarian (and not)!
The hummus, tabouli & majadra rice, is just the perfect lunch. Healthy and so good."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich.  Everything was fresh, well seasoned and really tasty.  I had the F-Bomb with beef which I wasn't sure about but it is well done:  Felafel and mini beef burgers in a pita bread with pickles, tahini, tzatziki yogurt sauce and freshly fried potato chips.    Yum.

There are lot's of veggie options too.

As another reviewer mentioned, the bonzo box is an engineering marvel for taking your sandwich on the go.

One suggestion for the banzo people to achieve total culinary nirvana --  toast or warm the pita bread up for the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Yummmm Falafel. It's delicious! Food cart, or their location are both consistently good."}
{"text":"I'm speechless! Mostly because my mouth is full of fantastic falafel! 

The food was exceptional, all of the hype I'd heard brought me in- but with such great reviews I expected there was no way the actual time I spent here could possibly meet the spectacular reviews. 

It was better. Beyond the tantalizing and diverse main dish, the environment was friendly and calm. The employees were on point and it was all very timely.

Thoroughly impressed, definitely in my top 3 of Madison's food thus far! If you aren't here, get going."}
{"text":"Wow! I am a fan of Banzo. I went in thinking it was probably overhyped, overpriced, and mediocre quality. I was really blown away. My \"F-Bomb\" pita was loaded with falafel and seasoned chicken. It probably weighed a pound, had tons of flavor, and the pita even held its own without falling into seventeen pieces. 

The falafel is clearly the star in my opinion. Super crispy on the outside, tons of flavor inside and not the least bit greasy or overdone. Loved it. The tahini sauce gives just enough moisture and flavor near the end when you get a little flavor fatigue. 

For $8.97, you really get a steal of a sandwich. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Their food card is phenomenal. I've never been to the restaurant location, but their falafel pita is a great choice for lunch."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a drive for me, but the staff is friendly and the food's always great. The banzo or f-bomb in a pita are always amazing choices."}
{"text":"Best falafel I have had, although I must admit I have not had that much.

The price is really good, you can pick it up, have it delivered, or drop on in to eat.  Nothing I didn't love about this place and can't wait to have it again.



Oh, I actually didn't care for the rice but that doesn't change my opinion one bit."}
{"text":"Best falafel in Madison; I could eat their F-Bomb pita sandwiches every day (never having to face the difficult chicken vs falafel decision I am plagued with at most other Mediterranean restaurants). I've been to the carts and the restaurant many times and the staff are always friendly and the food is consistently delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place- great hummus, falafel, and the eggplant in The Harvest is delicious. They have vegan options clearly labeled, which I always appreciate, and they even had vegan baklava this weekend! You can get your choice as either a sandwich, platter, or salad; I've had the sandwich in the past and this time I got the salad...which was good, but I liked the sandwich better (I think they even put thinly sliced fries into the sandwiches, mmmm). I definitely recommend The Harvest for the eggplant! Everything I've tried there is very good though, this place can certainly compete with other middle eastern food in the area."}
{"text":"The actual restaurant is adorable. It is a little out of the way, but a nice space with a beautiful patio. The service is no nonsense. But the good, oooooh the food. It is so good. Last time we went I had the Harvest, which was delicious. I wish the eggplant was a little less oily. However, they Definitely have the best hummus in town. The toppings really make the meal here. My husband had the Schnitzel which (unsurprisingly) is non-traditional but delicious."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at their restaurant, but I love their takeout! They give a discount for corporate orders, so order at work!"}
{"text":"Revising my review after an unfortunate experience. My friend ordered The Banzo. He took a few bites of falafel and then the next bite had chicken in it. He is vegan and gets very ill when he eats meat. I understand that mistakes can happen. But their attitude was what sealed the deal for me. No more Banzo. :( 

***************************************
I love this place for an inexpensive, filling meal, especially when eaten outside on their lovely patio.

I've tried the F-Bomb a couple times, but the chicken was way too salty for me. Now I stick with The Banzo and love the flavors. If only they could layer the ingredients better. All of the salad falls out of the top during the first couple bites, then you get lots of lots of falafel, and then at the end you have a glob of hummus with nothing else but a soggy chip. I usually end up buying a side of hummus (which is delicious) so that I can enjoy it while I eat my pita instead of at the end!

When I first started coming here, I was IN LOVE with their fries. They were perfect!! I don't know what happened...different oil, different cooks, I don't know...but now they are so hard and crunchy and salty they verge on inedible. Bring back the old fries!!

I keep returning for The Banzo, though."}
{"text":"I still love this place and eat there often. The only I problem I have is the constant inconsistencies. Sometimes we get chips in our F-Bomb sometimes not, sometimes the salad in nice other times too much mint or too much onion never the same. Sometimes falafel is perfect and yummy other times overcooked and burnt-ish. Consistency people!"}
{"text":"Aaron did reach out to me to rectify the situation and it was much appreciated 

I'm going to use the credit given to give them a second shot, I'll let you guys know how it goes"}
{"text":"Best food cart in town!! It's not just a quick bite during lunch hours, it's a real meal!"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Wifi neede a little help, thus the 4 stars.  Might have been good, but  they didn't know passord, and fumbled with it a bit.  We never got on the whole time we were there. Leaving, they finally go the password.

But the FOOD! Wow: awesome hummus, amazing falafel balls (not an expert on this, bu they were very tasty)."}
{"text":"Love this place.  

The falafel is delicious, and definitely the crunchiest I've ever had (in a very good way).  I also like the fact that they put hand-made chips on the sandwich - very Israeli (they like to put fries on their falafel sandwiches), but with a twist.  

Not the best falafel I've had, but definitely the best I've had in Wisconsin, and it holds up well to the greatest stuff I've had across the US and Israel.

This all is a bit bittersweet for me, as I just discovered Banzo yesterday.  This is bittersweet because I've been looking for good falafel as long as I've been in town (3 years), and am moving away in the fall.  Sad face.  But still I'm happy to have found it."}
{"text":"YUM!  I have eaten at both the cart and the restaurant. And had delivery.  The Harvest pita sandwich is my absolute favorite, somewhat to my surprise, because I usually go carnivore, and I generally don't like sandwiches.  The Baba Ganoush and falafel are terrific.  We have been sampling widely on the menu, and have yet to find anything we don't like. 

Anyway, the food and the service are great.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love Banzo! Super delicious, friendly staff, and speedy. I'd recommend the platter. The best thing on the menu if you ask me.

The only problem I had was nothing to do with Banzo...Apparently, when you order from Eat Street or any 3rd party service, they have to call in the order for you when you place it. Eat Street didn't call it in so I waited an hour and 15 minutes before I called Banzo when they told me this. They were SO SWEET and apologetic even though it wasn't their fault. They made the delivery in record time (20 min) and gave me a complimentary cookie. Love this place."}
{"text":"Although I live in Boston, I've eaten Banzo twice, once in person and once delivery. But I'd like to mention an evening when I couldn't eat it.  I was just too darn full from lunch.
Wife: Order it tomorrow for the flight home?
Me: I'm not leaving from anywhere near Banzo though.
Wife: Maybe, order it tonight and reheat it?
Me: You don't take the Mona Lisa, fold it up and toss it in your backpack, and then hang it in a steamed-up bathroom \"to get the wrinkles out.\""}
{"text":"Tasty and not expensive.  I had a delicious Banzo platter, but soon supplemented it with the squash soup and tabouli.  Pleased by everything on my plate and left with my stomach happily distended."}
{"text":"Have been there twice to order and take-out food.  The portions are HUGE!  Not to mention healthy and delicious!  This is the perfect alternative for fast-food.  I have been hoping for a long time that Madison would get a fast and HEALTHY place where I could drop in and pick up something quickly, and this is it!

I have not been to the food cart, only to the Sherman location which is poorly marked (hopefully not for long), but has plenty of parking and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, came here for lunch yesterday based on the yelp reviews and jackpot! Wanted to come back today, but alas they are closed Sundays. Leaving Madison tomorrow, so I'm gonna try convince my boyfriend we need those delicious falafels one more time. Because we do, they are amazing. If you haven't tried them, you should."}
{"text":"Okay, here's what you do.  

1) Find out where the Banzo food cart is hiding.

2) Order the F-Bomb.  When asked about the sauce, respond confidently with \"I'll take all three\"

3) Enjoy.

This is one of the best food carts around.  Make sure you show up early---as the lines get kinda long and the service isn't very speedy.   Totally worth it!   Just go now."}
{"text":"Went to their location on the east side because I've heard lots of good things and had been wanting to try it out. I really liked the old house that it was in and the infused water they have out. The food was delicious and HUGE- I didn't realize pita bread could be that large. I got the F-bomp pita sandwich, my friend got the eggplant pita sandwich and my other friend got the schnitzel pita sandwich- everyone gave their choices a thumbs up. The falafel was just as good as everyone says- the texture was incredible and you can see the array of deliciousness that it's composed of when you bite into it. I tried the eggplant and it was also delicious so definitely going to have to get that next time. My only quip is it's fairly expensive compared to other mediterranean restaurants I've been to but it's not going to stop me from coming back (especially now that they have a location on Willy St)."}
{"text":"This food cart is awesome! I typically am not a big fan of Mediterranean food but the falafels were so perfectly fried and the sauces perfect (my favorite is tahini), that this is one of the most perfect lunch choice at Library Mall. Everything is cooked to perfection, but I would definitely recommend getting the falafel rather than anything else, because seriously, the fried chickpeas is supremely perfect, with just the right amount of spices. Mmmm makes me hungry just thinking about it! I wish I were a student again so I can get this every week. Perfect for a quick lunch between classes/student jobs."}
{"text":"Banzo has the BEST felafel sandwich in Madison.  I like the felafel at the Mediterranean cafe more,  but there sandwich doesn't hold a candle to this place.  The meal is huge and the sauces are delicious.  Just writing this review makes me want another!

You should know that they aren't really fast.  Fast enough, but expect a little wait.  And, the level of red onion in the salad varies A LOT.  Steer clear of that topping if you don't care for it."}
{"text":"Wow!  Was missing all these good eats since I lived in Israel and then New York.  The hummus is wonderful, and the best pita I've had in forever.  I took a friend who had never had any of these foods, and she loved it also.  We both had the F-bomb plate.  She had the beef and I had the chicken.  We both preferred the chicken because we like spicier foods.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The Banzo cart is a winning addition to the plethora of Madison food carts. It provides authentic Israeli food at a good price. Natalie and Aaron who run the cart are so nice! 

And to make Banzo even better, now they deliver!

I had the F-bomb platter with mini burgers and it was delicious. Super fresh and even satisfied me and my boyfriend for lunch. The falafel could have been hotter but you cant blame them because they are fighting the cold And serving during 30 degree temperatures. Im so glad Banzo is here!!!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill! We used to order delivery all the time. We had noticed a decline in quality and service but kept giving them the benefit of the doubt. The last two times have been horrible!! The food arrives cold and is not the same high quality it used to be and the order tonight took two hours to arrive. On the plus side, they did refund our money. I would love to see them get back to where they used to be!"}
{"text":"I tried the restaurant yesterday. The falafel was to die for -- I'm still dreaming of it! I got the whole wheat pita (a stab at being healthier). It was soft and delicious, not dry at all. The hummus was really good, too. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic felafel and hummus.  Generous portions and reasonably priced.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The falafel had good flavor, but unnecessarily greasy- made my stomach pretty upset. Also, the sauce seemed to be more mayo than tahini...?"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places in Madison, and the best falafel I've ever had. Good, high-quality and healthy ingredients. Fast delivery. Easy takeaway!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chick Platter.  I expected grilled chunks of chicken on a bed of rice, but instead received shredded chicken flavored with taco seasoning.  Guess I should have ordered the F-bomb, but chose not to since I'm not into falafel.  Maybe the chicken with that would have met my expectations."}
{"text":"Saw the new cart while walking by the corner on E. Main and MLK on Capitol Square.  My wife had tried it at UW and liked it and I'd read good things too, so I jumped in line. I ordered the F-Bomb (how could I not?) and scampered back to the office.  OMG.  I came really close to going back and getting another one.  It was that good."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever seen a more overrated place in my life and I have been to a number of hipster places in Chicago.

First off, the people working at the actual restaurant location are a pretty inane lot forgetting they have you on hold or even not putting you on hold so you can hear their loud and annoying voices do other things.  One time I clearly stated my order with all the details needed (wheat pita etc.) and they still had to go through the litany of standard order questions.  It seriously came to the point where I did not eat here solely because I didn't want to go through the ordering process.

How's  the food?  Well it's obviously decent enough that I ate here multiple times despite the incompetence at the front desk.  They make good ingredients, in particular their hummus is really good.  Unfortunately, they can't make a sandwich worth a damn.  There is no balance to how the ingredients are arrayed in the sandwich with sauce maybe lightly coating the top or bottom if they are not passing it off in a side container.  Sometimes the chicken is cut up into manageable pieces, others you are left to rip the unwieldy pieces up yourself.  With my last visit the pita itself fell apart when I took it out of its box spraying toppings all over my floor.

If you want a good pita sandwich I recommend a place called New Amsterdam in Omaha, which is cheaper, better and gives you more food.  Basically the only thing Omaha has ever added to civilization.  Meanwhile I suggest you skip the Banzo cart and try the Thai cart or the Peruvian cart or the Indonesian cart where they are serving up something tastier and more unique."}
{"text":"First allow me to share my falafel pedigree.  I hail from the Detroit area, which with approximately 200,000 people of Arab descent has the vibrant culture and cuisine that comes along with a large expat population.  Which is to say, when it comes to Mideastern food and Lebanese food in particular Detroit is something of a Mecca.  I grew over time to love this food dearly.  This is to say, I am a bonafide and unreconstructed falafel snob.

I haven't lived in Detroit since 2006 and everywhere I have lived since (Connecticut, Chicago, Madison) I am perpetually disappointed in the flavorless mush balls passed off as falafel.  These atrocities are presented by well meaning friends with great excitement upon discovering my love for the stuff, and I try my best to be polite while choking down the bland goo slathered with crappy hummus.

And thus had been my fate until last Friday when my wife and I happened upon Banzo.  This falafel is the real deal.  Freshly prepared with a hot and crispy exterior shell and a wonderfully textured center, they are seasoned just right.  There are many options for how to get them - in a pita, a hummus plate, etc, but just get them.  If you've had falafel at People's Bakery, Great Dane, or any of the other establishments in town - no disrespect to them - withhold judgement until you have tried Banzo.  This is the only legit falafel in town, probably the only legit falafel in the state."}
{"text":"Finally tried Banzo last time.  How did we live in Madison for almost a year without trying this place?  There is such a buzz about Banzo, and the time was finally right.  And good thing because my mouth and tummy have never been so happy.  My husband got the chicken F bomb platter and I got the Harvest platter and we shared a baklava.  The hummus and pita were delicious.  The salad dressing was amazing!  and eggplant and falafel I could eat daily for an eternity.  The baklava was the best I've ever had.  The only less than amazing was the rice, which was still yummy but you know it was rice so.  Will definitely be back here as much as possible.  We got it to-go so can't say much about the service but the place was pretty packed.  BANZO = YESZO"}
{"text":"Falafel is one of my favorite things but Banzo is not. I was happy to hear that a location was open close to home - but I wasn't so happy after my first, second and third experiences. I felt like I was bothering the staff with the questions I had while ordering and I was told during my last trip that my full punch card wouldn't be honored. Loved the food but the customer service was lacking."}
{"text":"With a diverse selection of food cart options in Madison, its hard to choose where to spend your cash. Don't waste any of your precious lunch break time and head straight to Banzo. This noteworthy Mediterranean cart introduced me to the falafel a year ago, and I've been hooked ever since. 

I recommend \"The Chick\" served as a Pita Sandwich, and if you're at the Library Mall location you can't go wrong by enjoying the deliciousness while basking on Bascom Hill. I've also heard firsthand from a reliable source that \"The Harvest\" is a quality vegetarian option."}
{"text":"Oh my, oh my, oh my. Madison, you are so lucky to have Banzo! The pita is fresh and soft. The hummus is exactly perfect and creamy. The falafel - muah. You wouldn't expect a simple dish of rice and lentils to be worthy of craving, but, trust me, it really is. Add to that the condiments that heighten all the flavors: pickles, chili garlic sauce, fresh tahini - wow. 

For those looking for a caterer - and a vegan-friendly caterer at that - Banzo is pro. They were on time, everything was delivered fresh and beautiful. The only thing is that you should contact Banzo far in advance. The staff is very busy filling bellies with the best food ever, so getting a solid catering plan ironed out may take some coaxing and more work on your end. But it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Worst Mediterranean food ever. Their Hummus is bitter and expensive for what they offer. The kabobs I ordered appeared to be stale. don't eat here"}
{"text":"Banzo has the best Israeli food I've had outside of Israel! The F-Bomb and The Chick are my favorites. Literally the best falafel and eggplant I've had, and to add to the deliciousness, they have an assortment of really great toppings and extras! Fun workers too, its a pleasure to stand outside their cart in the cold weather!"}
{"text":"Banzo and Shuk has the best Mediterranean food in Madison. My Palestinian cousin from Israel was visiting Madison. We were at a catered event. He told me Banzo's food is the most authentic Israeli food he has ever eaten in the US. Their food is fresh, flavorful and filling. I love the owners. They are wonderful and generous people. Madison is lucky to have such a great Mediterranean food option."}
{"text":"I tried utilizing Banzo's delivery service, and forty five minutes later, it still hadn't arrived. I called and the employee claimed that it was just running a little late. Twenty minutes later, still no Banzo. I called again and the employee claimed the delivery driver had dropped it off, but there was no food to be seen. I cancelled my order and spoke to the manager. I love Banzo's food, but I'll never order delivery from them again."}
{"text":"My apologies for boring you with another 5 star rating here but Banzo is the bee's knees. Saturday was our first visit here and the felafel platter I had was perfect. I could eat it every day. Props to the chef for the side of chili sauce - what a great complement that I never would have thought of."}
{"text":"This place makes me wish I lived in Madison. I've eaten there twice in the past few months when I've been in Madison and now I dream about it! The falafel is perfect, chicken shawarma is tender and flavorful, and hummus is delicious. Also, the people who work there are very friendly. If they ever opened a location in Milwaukee, id go weekly!"}
{"text":"$3 à la carte for the best falafel in town? Absolutely. Perfectly fresh and crispy. Very happy to find Banzo."}
{"text":"Yum! The best Mediterranean food we have ever had. Ask for the house green hot sauce. You won't be sorry. If we were to do it again, we would stick with the falafel, it's done to perfection."}
{"text":"Going gonzo over Banzo. First ate in house and had perfectly made crisp falafel sandwich. Second, took out falafel and grilled eggplant sandwich. Got home and it was still hot!  The sauces are also delicious. Not to mention the handy dandy to go boxes that carry your booty upright and covered. I have been daydreaming about going back often!!  Thank you for truly well prepared fresh food. A quantum leap above your usual middle eastern inspired restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum!  The falafel is my favorite.  The pickled salad they serve is amazing."}
{"text":"I ate falafel at their food cart at farmers market. 
It was one of the best falafel I ever had. 
Definitely best place to eat falafel in Madison. 
Now they have a restaurant which is great. Dont forget to add their yogurt sauces."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal. Instead of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, I'd rather eat a whole quart of Banzo's hummus with a spoon."}
{"text":"Banzo has excellent food at reasonable prices.  I ordered the F-bomb chicken pita for $8.50 and the falafel side for $3.95.  I was full after only eating the falafel.  Both were great.  I ordered off of yelp for the first time and it worked without a problem.  The delivery was quick and the delivery driver was very friendly.  Good job Banzo!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious every time.  I have no idea how they make such relatively common food items (hummus, rice, falafel, etc.) taste so extraordinary."}
{"text":"The falafel was too salty (I thought so the last time I had their food, but hoped it was a fluke, but that seems to be how they make it), and it was also undercooked (pretty mushy) inside. Rice was OK. The hummous was also too salty.  Two tiny pieces of pita with a lunch plate were a disappointment (it is very good pita but not enough to eat the fillings with.) Fried eggplant were DRIPPING with oil. Salad was mostly cabbage. Cashew baklava was mostly filo dough; I could not discern any nuts.  Somehow their quality seems to be slipping. I had indigestion afterwards from all the oil, and my son the falafel fiend was disappointed too."}
{"text":"This five star rating is aimed at the delivery service, which seems to be overlooked and underrated. I've eaten both at the cart and the Sherman Ave. location and they would both rate a solid 4 stars, but delivery really is as good as it gets.

I've gotten Banzo delivered about a dozen times (ranging from 5 pm to 10 pm) and every time it's here in under half an hour. Not only is it quick but the food is always hot, the drinks cold, and the deliveryperson friendly. As a former delivery driver and someone who orders delivery often, I honestly don't know how it could get better."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and have also visited their cart on library mall. The sandwiches and platters are both good, I especially like the Harvest and F-bomb options. 
The humus platter/side has a generous amount of humus but they don't give you enough pita.
The fries are....pretty terrible. I was super hungry and needed more than just the pita sandwich so I ordered their hand cut fries. They should add in their explanation that they douse it with seasoning. There is way too much oregano or something and I couldn't even eat more than a few fries, over seasoned, dry and cold.

Other than the fries, their food is good for a filling lunch, If you like sauce be sure to order more because they only give you a small container."}
{"text":"Behold the fulfillment of my falafel dreams!  I first had a falafel pita Amsterdam Falafelshop in DC and fell in love.  Since then I have eaten falafel in several cities and states, but nothing ever quite lived up to that first one... until I had the Banzo!  Some falafel I've had were just fried flavorless balls, but here they are crazy crazy yummy.  Plus all the yummy pickles and whatnot that goes into the pita and the two sauces they serve with it (way better than any tahini I've ever had), and you've got a lunch worthy of the cravings that will inevitable ensue.   All hail the chickpea!"}
{"text":"Great falafel and pita and yogurt sauce. Also super flavorful smooth hummus. I will be back!"}
{"text":"A great dining option near the Dane County Regional Airport. It's housed in a refurbished house with a nice little patio area for al freso dining.

We ordered the F-Bomp Pita Sandwich and the Chick Platter. The F-Bomb was served in a warm wheat pita pouch that contained two lump balls of falafel, chicken (choice of beef also available), pickles, chips, and diced bites of julienne cabbage, cucumber, tomatoes, red onions, and cilantro. The falafel was really rich in flavor and the chicken was well marinated with abundance of flavor. You can choose tahini, yogurt or Siraccha chili sauce as a side, but we wanted to try all three and the staff happily obliged. The Platter is like the containment of the pita sandwich spilled onto a generous sized divided plate, it had the marinated chicken chunks, cucumber salad, slices of pita, with hummus and rice. 

It was $3 more than the sandwich and worth the price, it was big enough for two. 

The falafel had a really nice mixture of spices and good consistency. It was odd because one of the two was dry, but dredging it with tahini quickly solved that problem. 

I wish they serve a side of just their chips, they were so crunchy, dark in color, and rich in flavor of whatever oil it was fried in. Mmmm... heavenly!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Highly recommend and I am a tough critic. The hummus is top notch, best I've ever had. Same with the falafel. Oh how I wish I worked downtown Madison so I could go to the food truck weekly!"}
{"text":"YO THIS SH*T WAS PHENOMENAL. This is hands down the best falafel place ive tried and ive tried a lot of falafel. it's vegan and gluten free too I believe so I didnt have to worry about the devil that is dairy mess up my insides because of my lack of lactase or whatever. EAT HERE. Eat the falafel. Im going to go broke, the food cart is a block from my house. Say a quick prayer for my bank account. Mad good."}
{"text":"If I lived in Madison, I would be eating at Banzo all the damn time. As it is, we found out about Banzo via an article in a Madison magazine, so it was merely by chance that we decided to seek it out when we returned home from Mt. Horeb. 

Banzo's concept is simple: you basically pick groups of ingredients (e.g., I ordered the Harvest, which contains falafel, roasted eggplant, and a few other things) and how  you want it prepared (pita sandwich, salad, hummus plate, or platter). My husband ordered the F-Bomb (delicious chicken) platter, and I ordered the platter as well with the Harvest. I also tried a side of their tabouli, the salmon/avocado soup, and we both got ice teas. 

Their iced tea is amazing, first of all. I have never had better iced tea. And the food was delicious: we really liked the rich tahini flavor of the hummus and the crisp but fresh texture of the falafel. In addition to the hummus, we both got salad and rice with the platter, and both were outstanding. The flavor of the rice was out of this world!

Their flavors were really unique -- the chicken my husband ordered had a taste that we really couldn't pin down, but it was a good taste. The same goes for the rice, which seemed to have turmeric or curry in it. My only complaint was that they did not use basmati rice but regular, short-grain rice, which seems odd for a restaurant serving Middle Eastern cuisine. 

We really enjoyed our meal at Banzo and can't wait to visit Madison so that we can eat there again!"}
{"text":"Order at the counter and the food will be brought to your table. Staff was knowledgable about the food an ingredients used. Get the falafel plate!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best falafel and hummus in Madison. Actually, some of the best I've ever had in my LIFE (I'm talking in comparison to platers of hummus in Turkey and North Africa).
I order delivery from this place ALL THE TIME."}
{"text":"Holy crap, this was awful. We were in the mood for some Mediterranean food and decided to get some Banzo to go. This was the first time checking out this joint. We order a couple of lamb platters at about $15 a piece and head home, looking forward to a good meal. 

Came home, excited to check out the star of the dish and bite into some medium rare lamb, only to find four small, unappetizing, slider looking pucks of meat. On first taste it was confirmed to be overcooked, over-salted, super-spicy, dried up mix of lamb, spices and god knows what else.       

The rest of the container consisted of a very small salad, a smidgen of rice, 1 large potato chip broken in half, some hummus and half of pita. The sides were ok but I was shocked how little food it was for almost 15 bucks. 

So disappointed! Way overpriced and, more importantly, the food was complete garbage."}
{"text":"The falafel at Banzo is the best I ever had. Every time I pick up food or they deliver, you sense the genuine pride in the employees. I recommend the Banzo platter to give you a taste of some of the Banzo favorites. Whatever these folks are doing, they are doing it right. I love the \"hidden gem\" location, but if they consider venturing downtown, I know they will do very well!"}
{"text":"Banzo knows their beans.

I've been searching for great falafel ever since Caspian Cafe shuttered years ago and I've found it!  

I've had their food delivered to work and my apartment a bunch of times and I finally made it to the cart(check out their fbook or twitter accounts for specials and location).  The line and wait for food can be long, but please, I BEG you, to stick it out.  I've had a chance to explore most of their menu and it's all wonderful.

The food is so reasonably priced, especially give the portion size. You can have a pita sandwich with your choice of filling that comes in a well-designed to go box, or upgrade to a hummus plate (some of the best in town), or a platter.  Nothing will set you back more than $10.

I saw that they're going to be open for late night food soon and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Review for the food cart.

Excellent falafel for a very reasonable price. It's a little messy, but worth it. Do you need anything else from a restaurant? 

The people were polite and pleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Banzo on Sherman, you definitely should check it out.  I usually get the Banzo or Harvest platter.  I prefer the platter over the pita sandwich because it's easier to maneuver.  The soups are also delicious.  The only thing I've found that I don't care for is the couscous tabouli, which is almost entirely made of coarsely-cut parsley.  The service is great, and the owners are extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"Be careful ordering Bonzo \"to go\". They are expensive and most times your order is wrong or missing apps. We order it a lot, because we love their food, but come on Bonzo. This is getting a little repetitive. Could be my last time and that's too bad because there is no good food to order on the Northside"}
{"text":"Great food, fast delivery. Ordered the shawarma pita and F-bomb - highly recommended! Was told 45 minutes to an hour, but the delivery was here 30 minutes later. Everything was fresh and yummy. Very good value for my money."}
{"text":"I would put this place in my Top 5 falafel I have ever had in my lifetime. And I have lived a lot of places."}
{"text":"I came to try the banzo falafel pita. The pita bread was hot and fresh but the overall experience of flavor was lacking. I thought the falafel ball interior was too dry. The exterior of the fried bean ball was semi-burnt. The tahini side sauce was also very bitter. The hummus and chopped pickle topping combo was pretty good but there wasn't much of it to be found. 

This place is a far cry from Amsterdam falafel shop in DC."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for this little bright green food cart near capital square. While I have yet to visit the brick and mortar, I have been to their cart more than a handful of times and have never been disappointed - definitely my go-to when my coworkers and I decide to walk the square for lunch. The food is all made with fresh ingredients, which is noticeable in everything from their pitas to their hummus to their proteins.

I regularly order the chick pita, which is chicken tenders in their house marinade, a slaw salad and hummus all inside a pita. You can order a full or half pita and it comes in a little box that makes it easy to eat the pita on the go or back at the office. The big green salad is also yummy. You can add chicken or falafel or both (aka the F-Bomb). The lemon-agave dressing drizzled on top is a must!"}
{"text":"Personally, I've only had the Banzo Sandwich (falafel pita).  Once I have something I love, I prefer not to mess with perfection.  I've traveled in Israel, and this falafel is the real deal (which makes, since according to the website one of the owners is Israeli).  The pita bread is fresh and soft, the three sauces are authentic, and the Banzo box makes eating a delight (if you tear the strip around the side, you can eat out of the box and not make a mess all over yourself).

After only ordering delivery for two years, I finally ate at the restaurant. It is super cute, with decent service and a glorious patio.  I agree with others that it would be nice to have the option to put my fries in my pita, but this doesn't seem to be an Israeli thing so we might just have to do the heavy lifting on our own.  My feeling diners have always been pleased with their platters, but they tend to make wistful comments about my cute little sandwich (which is enough for two meals).  I suggest starting with a sandwich and working your way up from there.  If you aren't sure if your love for falafel, order a pita at lunch, when you get two for $10. You can give me the other one."}
{"text":"So I ate at their restaurant and not the food truck. Had the Schnitzel and it's damn good. It's a chicken schnitzel and the crust on the chicken is crunchy but more importantly, the chicken throughout is really, really juicy and tender. I was super pleased. The rice and salad that came with it were solid also. Would definitely repeat this place, and if the rest of the dishes are as solid, would make this place a regular."}
{"text":"They were totally right to rate this place best new food truck in Madison.  Everything is fresh, cheap, and delicious.  And the people who run the truck are super cool, and will happily tell you about where ingredience, recipes etc come from.  Great new place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to support. The owners are wonderful people they hire awesome people. The view from the new outdoor seating area is amazing. The food taste like it was made with love."}
{"text":"Holy delicious Mediterranean food-super fresh and delicious.

Everyone at our table of eight was impressed with lunch, and I'd go back in a heartbeat. I got the F-Bomb in a pita, and was a solid choice, but I think I'll do a platter next time."}
{"text":"Banzo is my favorite Madison restaurant. 

Straight forward Mediterranean food. 

Chicken Shwarmah special and falafel balls are my two favorite items. 

Their ice tea is great, and you get one free refill when you dine in at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Madison, and was hungry during lunch time, decided to try this place out since it's got great reviews on Yelp, ordered the chick plater to go, the service was good and time we received our food was under 10mins. The chick plater was so deliciously fresh and good, I ate it all and wanting more!! We will definitely be back again when we visit Madison."}
{"text":"Hey. We were greeted by a couple as we perused the menu by the register. They surmised we were newbies and said we were in for the best middle eastern anywhere. Granted that's in the gut it the beholder. We must have the same guts. If you're in the area, and like muddle eastern cuisine, don't miss this place. It may be informal in appearance, but fear not. It's clean and the food is the best. The eggplant was off the chart but everything we had was terrific. Big platters in the low teens. Totally satisfying. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was worried about finding falafel in Madison, but this place is amazing!!!! Awesome hummus and salads, too. It's the only thing you can order for delivery that won't kill you."}
{"text":"This review is for the food cart.

AMAZING. For the price I got my food at, 5 stars worthy for sure.

The people there were super nice, but also conversational which didn't make the interaction awkward. Despite the swarm of other customers nearby, they calmly took their time with me, having never been there before, to explain the different menu items, how long some would take, etc. I eventually decided on the F-bomb pita with beef kebab.

They said they were grilling the kebabs fresh but it still took less than 5 minutes; plus the other people surrounding the cart. The beef is ground, which I didn't expect, but every bite was just as flavorful as the next. After looking at yelp reviews online, apparently all the craze is the chicken. Could the chicken be THAT much better than the beef? I can't wait to try that out too. The flavor combination of the pickles, hummus, salad, chips with the sauces is INCREDIBLE. I don't know how it works out so swimmingly, but it resulted in a near-mouthgasm (amazing for 7 bucks).

I know everyone raves about the falafel, and it's no joke: I was legitimately saddened the moment I ate the last bite of falafel. My heart actually sank when I didn't see any more of that luscious, yellow-green falafel interior enclosed by the perfectly crispy brown crust. Holy f***. It's so good. Granted, I'm not a falafel enthusiast (I've had it like... 2-3 times maybe?) but I think I am now!

I only have 2 minor complaints which were definitely trivial enough to keep my 5-star rating:

First is the portions; 1 sandwich was definitely not enough, but 2 would've been overkill. Maybe I'll have to get the platter next time!

Second is the sandwich construction: As ingenious as the paper box is, the sandwich proportioning at the end is a let down. Let's put it this way: the meal ends on a much lower note than when it starts. Obviously it's because they have to stuff the pita from the opening, so there's all the yummy sauces and good stuff at the beginning and at the end it's the leftover liquid soaking up the last pita bites, but it does take away from the experience.

But seriously. So good. I will come again to buy The Chick platter and a special side of falafel, because 2 of those fried babies simply is not enough for me. YUM."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here! Their falafel is amazing. The only gripe I have is that they are stingy with the yogurt sauce. I like to use a good amount with my pita and the sides of sauce that they give you are tiny, ask for extra!"}
{"text":"Over done felafels less filled cartons then usual. My favorite delivery food. All other delivery's great"}
{"text":"I love this place.  One of the go-to carts on the Library Mall (be sure to follow on fb or twitter for location updates).  Their popularity during lunch may keep you waiting for 10 min.

Their eggplant sandwich is amazing.  The f-bomb sandwich with chicken (includes their falafel) with hot and yoghurt sauce is amazing.  All their sandwiches come in cardboard containers that open up like a zippo lighter to easily nom down the sandwich without spilling any of the good stuff.

I met Aaron and Netalee when they were down by Dayton and Orchard (by Union South, DoIT, CS) and they were extremely kind -- I only wish I could randomly run into them again; they don't seem to work in the cart when I go for lunch! :("}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food in Madison. I love how smooth their hummus is. Always the right amount of tahini."}
{"text":"Do you love falafel? Well I certainly do. The falafel here was as good as any falafel we had overseas. It reminds me of the falafel we ate in London last year.  We ate outside and had a great time for lunch. Very worth the trip on your scooter or bike.   Prices are very good and service isterrific."}
{"text":"I came here one night expecting mediocre but acceptable falafel. I was a in hurry and needed sustenance.  MIND BLOWN!  I got the falafel atop a chopped greek salad.  Phenomenally delicious with the local craft beer I had at the location. Honestly, the falafel was perfectly prepared.  Texture precise: crispiness of exterior and the softness of the interior  - WOW -  magical in my mouth!  I have since made \"chopped\" greek salad and it's a dream.  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Still wonderful... clean, quick and dependable. The owner is lovely and he treats his staff with respect. I always eat the chicken but occasionally try something new. I am never disappointed but always end up with the chicken.
Tiny space but they manage. I am always pleased with the bathrooms. Hey, that's super important.

Check it out. Easy on the wallet, delicious on the tongue."}
{"text":"The F-bomb platter is seriously the BOMB! We get takeout from here and it is always quick and fresh. I also love their falafel and hummus. Reasonably priced, extremely fresh, and always a go to!"}
{"text":"I had the F bomb pita sandwich and it was the best thing I've had in a long time. I can see why it's called the \"f bomb\" it was f-in amazing!"}
{"text":"Casual Middle Eastern eatery with counter service and a small number of indoor table (some outdoors when the weather permits). I usually take away. The service can be curt, but the food is amazing so I generally look past it. The hummus and falafel are what you go for. The pita is imported from Israel - it's the real thing."}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my fiancé and I have already raved about my meal to at least 3 people! I had heard about the awesome food truck and recently heard there was also a restaurant but assumed it might just be open for lunch, I was wrong it's off the beaten path but close to everything and easy to get to. They are open until 9pm on most nights! They also deliver! I have no good excuse for waiting so long to make it here! Delicious!! I cannot wait to go back, last night we had the chicken pita sandwich and chicken rice platter but look forward to trying the falafel. They have delicious homemade soups too! They have a cozy patio with a view of Burrows park which will keep me dreaming of summer."}
{"text":"Love banzo! Come here all the time and visit their cart also. Great food all around. Always fresh tasting, great summer spot to sit outside."}
{"text":"Usually not a big Mediterranean food lover.  Everyone makes it differently, some good some not so good.  Banzo however is a welcome surprise.  Tried the \"F-bomb\" plate.  We did both the chicken and the beef.  Comes w/2 falafel balls, rice, bread, hummus and a little dressing.   Seriously, the best!!  Very reasonable price, quickly served.  I preferred the beef just a bit more.  Well prepared-hummus was very very good.  Not garlicky or overpowering.  Selection of wine as well as some non-Mediterranean dishes are availble.  Atmosphere: its the Isthmus.  Free Wi-Fi, you have to get the password while I normally don't like that, I can understand not paying for the neighborhood to have free Wi-Fi and reserving it for your customers.  Inside and outside seating.

Great experience, value for money, will return again and again."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. The food tasted so delicious, so clean, the best falafel I've ever had. 

I highly suggest getting the F-Bomb platter, lots of delicious treats on one plate. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Choose wisely for 5 star food! 

I had been to the food cart a handful of times for a quick lunch so after a paddle on the lake we decided to stop in for a late dinner. 

The restaurant is causal, patrons order at the counter and food is brought to the table. 

I had every intention to try something not offered on the food cart menu, but I failed. I got the dependable f-bomb platter with chicken. As always, it was delicious! The falafels were perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My friend had never been there before, that was my recommendation to her also. She told me she did not like falafels, so of course I took that as a challenge. She got the kebab, and enjoyed it. Most importantly, she now loves falafels. Friends have tried other menu items and not enjoyed them. My advice to you... get the f-bomb for a great variety of some of their best menu items. We each got the sangria - which was ok and shared the baklava (orange and walnut) - which was amazing! 

We sat on the outdoor patio which was quiet and intimate. It had beautiful lights strung overhead and made for the perfect spot for us to catch up without the pressure of a server."}
{"text":"This is the best hummus and falafel.  Whether you get the platter or the sandwich, it is awesome.  The falafel is perfectly cooked every time.  The seasoning and flavors is amazing.  The veggies are fresh and blend the flavors very well.  I think I've only gotten the ones with chicken.  It is too good to pass up.  The pita and hummus are the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Tasty and in good price. This is my first time to try banzo and not bad. But should have eaten with water or coke, otherwise it's too dry and oily."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of food trucks and love me some good falafel. Banzo married these two better than any I've sampled! I would stand in line through blazzing heat and brutally cold days just to eat lunch here. 

Thank you Banzo."}
{"text":"Really great hummus and falafel! Love ordering delivery from here. I am a fan of ordering the hummus plate options, because it comes with a ton of hummus and you can eat it for days. They also have yummy pickles you can get on the side. 

Tip: if you are calling for delivery, ask what the ETA will be. Sometimes it can take a pretty long time. Though usually worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Meh. The meat was tasty and well-seasoned. The falafel was interesting, but the serving sizes didn't seem \"fair\" or \"satisfying\" as a choice for a meal. :\ I don't think that the ingredients are *too* expensive and compared to foods like sushi, the prep for falafel and pita is probably \"medium-low\" (I don't know, just guessing, so my opinion ought to be taken with a grain of salt) but I think Banzo could do well to be a bit more generous with their food"}
{"text":"This place certainly does not disappoint. It is one of my favorite places to go for lunch. My favories include their Falafel, hummus, pita, and madras rice.  I'm not sure how they make their hummus, but it is so ridiculously creamy and addicting."}
{"text":"Truly great falafel has been sorely missing from Madison for a very long time. Places like Shish Cafe and Med Cafe offer up a pretty decent shawerma but the falafel around town has always been dry and oddly-flavored up until now. Banzo makes a falafel that rivals the stuff I have eaten in the Middle East, at prices that rival some parts the Middle East - particularly Israel, where one of the founders originates.

The authenticity does not stop at the falafel, either. Schnitzel is a staple of Israeli cuisine due to the Ashkenazi influence, while their \"mini-burgers\" are blended with a truly Middle Eastern mix of spices, vegetables, and fat. I have no idea why they call them mini-burgers though, because they are undoubtedly the very same kofta meatballs I grew up eating in an Egyptian household.

I just wish they would open on the weekend, because I've already suffered many a disappointing hangover wherein a juicy falafel sandwich would have been exactly what I needed.

Banzo could also seriously benefit from taking a couple pages from Israel's own falafel enterprise: 
1. Add laffeh bread to your menu. Your pitas are excellent but I would more than willingly pay a slight upcharge for the \"Chipotle burrito\" of falafel sandwiches.
2. Give me the option to stuff chips (french fries) in my falafel.

My suggestions should in no way be taken as \"needs improvement,\" though. There's no doubt in my mind that the Levantine Arab style of falafel is the best in the world, and Banzo absolutely nailed it. The fact that they deliver makes this THE go-to place for delicious and even healthy fast food."}
{"text":"A twist on the authentic that thoroughly succeeds. I've always enjoyed what I've gotten here. The only hindrance is that it is a bit expensive. That being said, I'll continue to return for the falafel and well seasoned hummus."}
{"text":"I am picky about my food. I have tried other falafel in the city and banzo is by far the best place to go for it.  Simple and delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!  Seriously, their falafel is the best I've ever had, and I'm pretty familiar with the stuff.  It's a popular cart, so you might have to do some waiting, especially if you come during the noon hour.  Both the plate and the pita are amazing, but I find the flavors of the pita with the pickled vegetables, chips, hot sauces all smothered together just fantastic.  Go for it - you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great falafel. I hear they have started up local delivery which is great when you need a healthy late night fix."}
{"text":"BEST falafel AND hummus in town... and the eggplant steaks are magical. These falafel have the perfect crunch, but I wish there were better kid options - mine don't care for the spicy chicken and you can't order it plain. But hey... I gotta give the best five stars!"}
{"text":"Found these guys on yelp. Called for delivery. They told me I was out side there delivery area, so I offered an additional $10. They took me up on the deal! Got the f bomb platter it was great, hand cut frys are the best I have had in Wisconsin (by far)! Falafel was great, I mean really great, hummus was fresh and tasty!  Lentil soup was very good. I have two complaints. They sent Hunts ketchup,  sorry it sucks, and the salad was just OK. The green mix was good but the dressing was oily and flavorless. Still worthy of a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I tried the lentil soup and the eggplant platter and had it delivered to my hotel while I was in town. Delicious food! The portion was bigger than I had expected, the falafel was crispy and yummy and everything tasted amazingly fresh! Will order again when I'm around!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant for Mediterranean. I've been to the restaurant for both dinner and lunch, and both times were great. I went with a bunch of girlfriends for dinner a few weeks ago. I had the F-bomb platter for dinner and it was a LOT of food for not much $$. We were in and out in an hour, and there was NO conversation during dinner -- I think b/c everyone was so busy eating their yummy dinner. 

I had the Chicken hummus plate for lunch yesterday. Next time I'll go pita or platter -- anything that comes with falafel! I'm excited this place delivers to my house ... I'm posting the menu on my fridge for future reference."}
{"text":"OMG, Banzo. This restaurant, which grew out of the original Banzo food cart, features fresh-made Mediterranean dishes like hummus, falafel, and babaganush. They also have delicious American-style foods like marinated chicken, beef kebab, and Schnitzel.

Banzo's food is so good that you'd almost believe it's not real, but the happy reality is that it Israel. Of course, you know I'm telling the truth -- after all, I Canaan tell a lie. Oman, I'm Mecca-n myself laugh now ... (Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all night).

Banzo's falafel is the first and only falafel I've ever liked (and I tried it many times during the month I spent in Israel). Their specialty chicken is superb -- cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. The pita bread (imported directly from Israel) hits the ball right in the pocket (bad dum ching), the humma-humma-hummus is SO good, and the salads are fresh and flavorful.

On top of their great food, it also happens that Banzo's owners, Aaron and Netalee, are both genuinely great people. I guess that shouldn't be a surprise, though, given what a wonderful restaurant they've brought to the Madison community."}
{"text":"Banzo consistently delivers crispy, flavorful falafel and the creamiest hummus around (how do they do that?). We stopped in for an early dinner on Saturday and I enjoyed the Harvest Platter. The platter came with falafel, grilled eggplant (that was slightly undercooked), hummus/pita, perfectly fluffed rice, and a small salad that could have used a boost of acid and salt. We sat in a cozy purple room that matched the lovely sangria we were sipping on. It was a wonderful way to unwind on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Love Banzo! Always a go to when I need a falafel fix. Their hummus is top notch and they have great tabbouleh,  too."}
{"text":"We live in the area and this place is our go-to for takeout and delivery! Absolutely love it :) The hummus is phenomenal. I usually go for the chicken F-bomb platter."}
{"text":"I was tempted to give them a 1 to reduce the length of the line at the food cart every day, even in rain, but that would be a lie.  I'd stand in the rain and cold, and I have, for as long as it takes to get their falafel.  I switch between the sandwich and the platter, but either way I go for the tahini and hot pepper sauce, totally awesome.  Their hummus is very good, though if I am to be honest not quite as good as Mediterranean Cafe, but I can live with that.  I LOVE falafel, this is better than NYC food cart falafel, which has long been my gold standard, and I've eaten a lot of 3am NYC food cart falafel."}
{"text":"Super delicious place that we discovered while visiting Madison back in April before moving here!  They deserve their 4.5 star rating.  This is about as good as it gets for Mediterranean food.  They have a lot of vegan / vegetarian options.  We have their falafel meal plate and split pea soup.  Everything was really delicious.  The atmosphere is super cute and cozy, and the guy, who co-owns the restaurant with his wife, was very genuinely nice."}
{"text":"This is handsdown one of my favorite rrestaurants - not just in Madison but in general! I absolutely love falafel. I was long-awaiting a casual dining alternative to the fancier Bunky's (serves Mediterranean food). I was so excited to discover Banzo. They have 2 amazing vegetarian options - the Harvest (falafel and eggplant) & the Banzo (falafel!). You choose your base entree (ie the Harvest) and then decide whether you want a sandwich or some type of platter. I also live for their baklava!"}
{"text":"I am in love with Banzo since the first time I tasted their falafel. I usually get pita one. The taste is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"We got the Groupon for this place, and cashed it in tonight once we realized we had nothing planned for dinner. We'll eat with Banzo again, for sure! Very good sandwiches and sides. My husband got The F-Bomb with chicken, and I got The Harvest. We got sides of falafel and hummus, and each got an iced tea. Everything was GREAT, the service (over the phone) was super friendly and we're especially excited about them moving into the old Vientiane Garden spot on Sherman -- that's just down the road from us, and just a decent dinner walk away!"}
{"text":"I really, really love this place. Owner, Netalee, learned to make hummus from her grandmother as a child in Israel. It's a two-day process and the end product is truly amazing.

I've traveled to Israel several times for work, and I've been able to eat some of the finest Mediterranean food you can find anywhere, and Banzo is on par with that. They take great pride in starting with fresh ingredients and not taking shortcuts. They also take pride in ensuring many of their offerings are vegetarian or vegan, and they don't have any processed foods in sight.

Whether you are at the food cart or the main restaurant, you cannot go wrong. The F-bomb pita with chicken on wheat never disappoints, and you get your falafel fix with the two that are included in the pita. The clever pita take-out box is great too!

We live in the neighborhood and have seen many restaurants try to make it in their space that is an old house. They've done a nice job with the space and we LOVE the patio. I was there at 1:00 today and it was hopping. So nice to see Netalee and Aaron putting down roots here."}
{"text":"Mmm this place is such a treasure for the Sherman/Tenny Park area! Natural food, great portions, and just delicious in every way from meats, veggies, and sides. If there is anything I would critique, it would be more seasoning in the babaganoush (sp?), but that can be personalized by your own salt and spice tastes. Give them a try and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My meal was average but I will definitely go back and try something else.  I liked that atmosphere and the wines were very good."}
{"text":"I've eaten at both their food cart and their restaurant, and you can't go wrong with either. Amazing. 

I recently ordered both The Schnitzel and The Chick, opting for a platter and a pita. I shared with someone, and it was plenty of food. Everything was absolutely delicious. I'd recommend getting the platter, because it comes with a good amount of extra food, including rice and hummus. Also, the falafel is fantastic!

This recent order was for delivery, and the person who brought my food was very nice. When I've dined at the actual restaurant, it's always been a pleasant experience. They have a nice space and the staff is friendly.

I've eaten at Banzo about a dozen times and it has always been amazing. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Order delivery last night via eatstreet. The delivery was prompt and the food quite good. I got a chicken platter with a side of falafel which was quite good. I would highly recommend the falafel!!!"}
{"text":"Banzo is my favorite food cart and really introduced me to how good falafals can be. It's a great place to check out during a normal trip to the farmer's market if you go there regularly. The prices are right and sometimes there is a bit of a wait due to the popularity of the place but the wait is worth it! Don't forget to add dressings."}
{"text":"Banzo has, hands down, the best falafel that I have ever eaten. It is light, perfectly crisp, freshly fried, and delivered with delicious tahini sauce. Their hummus is simply superior. If Banzo stuck to serving only products linked to its namesake (garbanzo beans) I would give this restaurant five stars without a thought. 

The Punchline: drop what you are doing and immediately go to Banzo and eat falafel and hummus. Now. It will change your life.

The Proviso: Banzo does attempt to reach out beyond falafel, with less success. Their eggplant is delicious, but sodden with oil. Equally, their chicken suffers from the same vice that plagues most chicken served in Madison: it is over-spiced, and over-cooked.  The chicken is edible, but regrettable. I have not eaten the beef kabob, so I have no opinion on this option. That being said, why would you eat any of this when you can eat the falafel and hummus?

Eat the falafel."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. The waiter and waitress are very friendly. The hygiene is acceptable in general.  But the dishes, utensil and table are not clean sometimes."}
{"text":"I've only been at the food truck, which is pretty good for the buck.

Both times I've been I ordered their falafel sandwich. The falafel was soft and tasty and the hummus fairly standard. The bread was ok; a bit stale.

7$ for a decent and fulfilling lunch, so I'll go back too Banzo a couple of times a year."}
{"text":"The chicken pita was nice. Nothing spectacular though. A good place to have lunch if you don't have any better options."}
{"text":"I stayed in Madison for over a week, and this was the first and THE BEST meal I had by far. My friend, who is a native to Madison, took me around to all the other famous places Wisconsinites like to eat, but I still kept asking to come back to Banzo. Even after my first visit, the food and the ambiance and the staff left quite an impression on me. The restaurant feels like you are eating in someone's home, the staff is friendly and helpful with first timers trying to figure out what to order, the food came out quickly, and we sat out on the porch and ate, the view and the weather was lovely.

I can't remember the name of what I ordered, but it's one of the most popular platters there according to the staff. The chicken was cooked nice and tender and everything was super flavorful! It came with two crispy falafel balls, not too dry...the best hummus I've ever tasted, nice and thick, I only wish they gave you more, I licked my little bowl clean! Even the SALAD was really flavorful, I'm not quite sure how they did that, and I never tried saffron rice before but it's amazing! Everything on my plate had it's own unique flavor, so that I could move around on my platter and not get bored of what I'm eating, and the portions were perfect, so that everything was good from beginning to end! Can't wait to visit Madison again just so I can eat here!"}
{"text":"Food was great, lovely spot to break our road-trip and enjoy fresh & delicious falafel and salad."}
{"text":"F-bomb is my favorite. The meat patties are flavorful. They can be slow....."}
{"text":"I ate there last week and keep craving it. Always a good sign.

We ordered a lot of food to try as much of the menu as we could. That was certainly enough to bring us back. 

The falafel is to die for. Seriously, the tastiest falafel I've ever had. And I've eaten more than my fair share of falafel in life.

The chicken \"schnitzel\" is a spicy breaded slice of goodness. Sooo good.

Their salad was great, with lots of ingredients and a delicious dressing.

The only thing on the menu that I was not too excited about was the hummus. For my taste it had too little citrus pop and too little garlic. The tahini in the hummus had a great flavor though. Your mileage may vary.

The location is a bit hard to find if you don't know the neighborhood. It's a house that's been converted into a commercial space. They have a nice deck outside that is across from a park. In addition to the small room where you order your food (with only a few tables), there is a larger room with a lot of character that they are still setting up.

I'm looking forward to trying the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"THE F-BOMB PLATTER IS THE EFFING BOMB.

I don't know about you kids, but I know I'm F-ing lazy when it comes to eating out sometimes. This definitely applies to me back when I was in school. So thank the heavens for the Banzo cart which was in Library Mall almost EVERY day. And if it wasn't, their twitter lets you know where they are. I've been to the actual restaurant once and it was just as good. The house is really cute but it's in the middle of nowhere...at least for me, the student/isthmus dweller sans car. 

Back to the F-Bomb: The marinated chicken is a slightly sweet, light, and filling. The falafel balls are fluffy and falafelly, and the chopped salad is inexplicably tasty. What makes a salad special? I don't know, but Banzo's is pretty F-ing good.

The food won't leave you in a state of self loathing or immobile a la food coma. You'll just daydream of falafel balls dancing around your head for the rest of the day.

Ain't no thang."}
{"text":"My friends and I shared a F-bomb sandwich which was good but not amazing. I enjoyed it but maybe bc we got different food from other carts, it didn't stand out compared to the other carts we got. I do recommend this place and say that this place is one of the top 3 carts located here though!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. We had both the schnitzel and Shwarma platters and they're not afraid to use spice. I would have taken a picture of the great looking dish but it's disappears too quickly. 

Highly recommended. I really wish they had a closer location to campus. They do have food carts but I never make it to them in time."}
{"text":"My first time there and really got excited for baba ganoush. It was nothing even similar to what it's supposed to be. I'm truly offended by how bad it was. It's a tiny menu, there's no excuse.
Baba ganoush is charred and roasted so it's smoky and has tahini in it. And it's smooth... They served me chunky boiled eggplant with no tahini and no flavor. It was awful.
I'm not the only customer who has commented on how bad it is. Guys, try a new strategy and make it correctly and authentically... or rename it - cuz what you served me is not even close. So gross..."}
{"text":"Banzo summed up in one word? Delicious. Incredible. Fantastic. 

Okay, three words.

The Banzo food cart serves incredibly fresh and tasty Mediterranean food at a very fair price. I paid $9 for the Banzo platter and was handed a 9x9x3 to-go container filled to the brim with food. All of the food -- from the falafels to the hummus to the salad -- is fresh, prepared perfectly and just bursts with flavor.

The people working are friendly. 

This is my favorite food cart in Madison!"}
{"text":"I spent a summer sailing around the Mediterranean so I like to consider myself a falafel connoisseur (I only mean for that to sound pretentious in a sarcastic way), but Banzo is in a league of its own! Its got the perfectly crispy outside and flavorful, smushy inside I can never get quite right in my own kitchen.  All the sauces are awesome (especially together!) and they're certainly not stingy on the toppings. Even if you don't think you're in the mood for Banzo falafel...yes, you are."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal from Banzo. I love the F-Bomb with chicken and falafel. So yummy. I also love their homemade potato chips.Their delivery was speedy, it only took like 25 minutes to arrive."}
{"text":"I caught Banzo on the tail end of lunch hour during a recent trip to Madison and man am I happy I did. They were out of a lot of stuff (the sure sign of delicious food), but were so good-humored and adventurous about what kind of food they could give me and Corey D that I think I may have enjoyed the random ordering procedure even more than I would have had I just been ordering standardly.

What did I eat? A little bit of a lot of things... falafel, hummus, pita, chips, pickles, and an array of their made-from-scratch sauces. Considering I paid around 7 bucks for this tasty treat in a box I was definitely a happy camper.

The food + the happiness of the workers in the truck = a 5 star experience for me!"}
{"text":"Went here to try something different than our normal resturant choices.  We found this place looking on yelp.  Thier reviews were fantastic.  When we pulled up there was construction everywhere going on.  We were confused where this place was.  They had food trucks out back of an old house looking building.  That old house was the resturant.  Once inside and we got a handle on what we were about to eat and how to order it.  We were excited to try.  We both even said worst case scenario if we don't like it we can put it in a box and go.  However, that was not the case folks.  The food was delicious.  I had what was called the F-bomb platter and my wife had some chix pita sandwich.  The F-bomb was some falafel balls and beef kabobs.  Serve with a pita and yogurt sauce along with some hummus.  Not a huge fan of yogurt sauce or the hummus.  However the plate had some good rice and a fresh salad on it.  Impressed to say the least.  My wife's food was filled with flavors.  It was messy, but wonderful.  I would try this place again.  I would have given it a 4 star if it wasn't for the high prices and the terrible construction noises going on outside during our entire lunch.  I will change my review on out next visit."}
{"text":"I was expecting really delicious yummy falafel sand to be honest, I was disappointed.

It wasn't horrible but certainly not worth the $10 I paid. The pita bread was really good, soft and chewy. The falafel was nice and hot but lacked any sort of flavor. I could have used some salt but unfortunately didn't have any immediately close by  to spice up the meal. The sandwich was served with two sauces that didn't really complement the meal. 

However the young lady who took my order was nice and my meal was ready within a reasonable time. I think I will be on the hunt for a different falafel place the next time I am in Madison."}
{"text":"We agree. The falafel are the best around.  Although their pita is pretty good as well.
Decided to not go out, but order out this Saturday night.  
As Banzo was nearest restaurant on our list, it was the choice.
Ordered the Banzo platter, the f-bomb platter and a side of tabouli.
All were delicious.  The chicken kabobs from the fbomb platter were season just enough to have a kick, but not overwhelm. The salad cooled off the palette, and the falafel are the best.  keep it up.  cucumber sauce is fantastic, just a great spot.
Oh, the pita, light fluffy and so much more in everyway than store bought pita.  Go!!  We'll be back often."}
{"text":"The food tastes good. Like really really good. Why 3 stars? The service is consistently disappointing. Delivery takes really really long and sometimes its hard to get someone to answer the phone. I know that places get slammed, I know orders can take longer when it is busy however I would prefer to be told that the workload is too much to take my order instead of being told it will be 45-an hour and then wait almost two hours for my food that is delivered ice cold. 
Fortunately hummus and the salad are good cold. My chicken and rice still had good flavor but with getting cold the texture was dry.
I refuse to make any employee feel bad, because I know it is tough to know your pissing people off by being behind but seriously, say no to orders when your behind to get caught up and can provide the quality food everyone wants."}
{"text":"Banzo is one of those places that I wake up in the morning and just know that I have to go eat at asap.

Banzo was the place that first introduced me to falafel when I was in college, and they still remain my favorite place to go.

Their falafel pita with all the sauces is amazing. The combination of the Falafel, warm pita, crisp vegetables and crunchy potato chip (yes I said potato chip... you are going to have to trust me on this one) is AMAZING!

I have introduced both my boyfriend and brother to their first falafel through Banzo and I am sure I will continue to introduce friends and family members in years to come!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously on-fleek. Normally food trucks tend to be overpriced (or maybe that's in LA where I'm from...) but Banzo really gives you a bang for your buck. For $7 I got the Banzo pita, loaded with 4 large falafel balls, Israeli salad, etc. It was a lot of food for a very good price, which I wasn't expecting. They even gave me the option of whole-wheat pita which is a plus. I believe they also accommodate vegan/gluten-free requests. To top it all off, they handed me my food within ~30 seconds of me ordering. Very convenient and quick, although there was no line when I got there so that may vary.
As someone who's been to Israel and has sampled all kinds of falafel/pita there, this place definitely compares to the authentic falafel stands I've visited on the streets of Tel Aviv. I will be sure to come back here anytime I feel nostalgic for Israel and I know I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, but a little salty. Somehow I always end up with a stomach ache after eating their food."}
{"text":"Each time that I've been to banzo I've had a great experience. The food is always fresh and delicious and the people working always have a smile on their face. Between ordering and taking a seat, it usually takes about 15 minutes for you food to hit the table."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the falafel balls a pita was fresh but that was about it. Cucumber sauces tasted sour and bad :/"}
{"text":"I love you, falafel.  You are sometimes bland and sometimes overcooked, but at Banzo, dear falafel, you are perfect.  

The hummus was also excellent.  The fries, while they came in a huge serving that I couldn't finish, were delicious.  The only shortcoming with my meal was the salad--I wasn't a fan of the dressing.  It probably didn't help that since I ordered delivery, my salad had been stuck in a container with the hot food, so take that with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Why am I not surprised to see the perfect score? I had the harvest pita which comes with 2 felafel and a seared eggplant. I can never resist eggplant. And I think form now on I might not be able to resist felafel either.

Those felafel where perfect balls of happiness. Not sure how they make them, but they were perfectly crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Sometimes felafel can be a bit dry, bit these ones were perfectly moist and delicious.

Had to wait a bit for it, but I would happily go back and wait all over again just to get another one of those delicious felafel!"}
{"text":"Another favorite of ours from our old stomping grounds. Banzo's food is so, so good. The hummus is out of this world (and sold in select grocery stores -- lucky for you). Plus, the falafel, majadra rice, homemade chips and fresh salad are delish! A great place to go if you like supporting local and prefer a down-to-earth vibe."}
{"text":"I love the Banzo platter or Banzo sandwich. The f-bombs are not the best, in my opinion, but I have friends who love them. Both the restaurant and food cart are amazing. Fantastic spin on Mediterranean food. They always make delivery easy as well, which is a big plus."}
{"text":"Banzo has a location off Sherman but also puts a cart down on campus for lunch during the week.  Sometimes its on State but I have also seen it across from Computer Sciences near the geological sciences building.

Anyway, this food is awesome.  Never had anything here I don't like.  The platters are great for kids to share.

Wish they had more expansive hours."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this place opened! Banzo is my favorite food cart by far in downtown Madison, and the food here is no different from their amazing food cart meals! The falafel is amazing, either in platter or pita."}
{"text":"The BEST falafel I have ever had. YUMMMMM. as mentioned in other reviews- perfectly crunchy on the outside and creamy and amazing on the inside.
Had the falafel w/ grilled eggplant in a pita sandwich which was also stuffed w/ a chopped salad and hummus and chips!
the pillowy soft, fresh pita comes all the way from Israel (frozen) then they bake it to make it fresh. fantastic.
My companion had the beef kabob plate- 4 big meatballs of spiced beef- served w/ hummus, chopped salad, tahini and fresh pita.
It was 11 degrees out when I got the falafel craving so we headed to the restaurant on Sherman Ave. What a nice surprise! A cute little bungalow, re-imagined as a cafe where you order in the front room and then head back to a nice warm room filled with about 10 tables. Very cozy and pleasant with a high ceiling and colorful art on the walls. Did I mention Warm? 
confession- I always get the baklava if it is on offer. Housemade and DELISH!! very cinnamony with perfect flakiness and lots of nuts.

I look forward to the spring and summer when I can get some of this food from one of their carts and take it to a sunny spot to enjoy. they also have a nice looking deck/patio at the sherman spot for when the snow melts. If it ever does."}
{"text":"I work downtown, but venture to their Sherman location often because I don't want to bother with the lines at the food truck. I love sitting on the porch, and noshing on their fresh dishes. 

Last time I got the F-bomb sandwich. Everything about it was amazing. It's one of those items that it makes it hard to try anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Banzo's food is delicious. Their falafel is flavorful and fresh and I love the potato chips on the pita sandwich. They also have a great patio to sit out on during the summer. I only wish they had a bit more indoor seating for those nights when it's not patio weather (most of the year in Madison!)"}
{"text":"Upping them to 4 stars. My falafel was, for the most part, quite good, although I've got a handful of suggestions that could easily improve it.

Got the Banzo--$6--and this thing was *loaded* with falafel. I mean, there were balls everywhere (stop thinking now, perverts). Also in the pita: hummus, cucumber/tomato salad, a couple pickles, homemade potato chips and some tahini.

Hummus, from what I could taste, was pretty decent, but nothing special. The thing was a mess and fell apart as I got to the bottom! Obviously, not a complaint from me, because this thing was packed to the brim. The falafel balls themselves, were delicious. The potato chip at the bottom wasn't really crispy--it had become soggy by then. In Israel, cuts of potato are either thick or they're french fries. Salad was pretty basic, but good.

Sauces: chili garlic, tahini, yogurt dill. Still no green sauce! And by green, I mean green zhug--the classic hot pepper hot sauce.

Yogurt dill was tasty, but weird for falafel. Red chili wasn't as thick as I'd like, but still good, and tahini was tahini. Overall? Pretty solid.

Will I be back? Yeah, I think so. I need to try other things. So, here are my suggestions for Banzo:

1) Thicker cuts of potato. Chips are fine on the side, but if it's not thick in the pita, then you don't get any of the flavor--and it loses authenticity.

2) Laffa. Seriously--offer it! More durable than pita and people will pay more. I know I would.

3) Green zhug! It's easy to make, it's spicy, and it's delicious. 

4) They should really offer sabih--the traditional Israeli/Middle Eastern eggplant-in-a-pita dish. I'd buy it.

I'm rambling. Overall? Good. Service? Great. Everyone is so damn nice. I'll go back."}
{"text":"This is OK food played up to a small-town audience wowed by cool packaging and the apparent \"exoticness\" of chick peas.

If you're near the cart a falafel sandwich is a decent choice though there's often a long line.

Delivery is less recommended. A basic meal for two (two sandwiches and a couple sides) costs almost $30 with delivery charges. Their side sauces are in tiny cups that are only half full and you have to pay for more. Overall I like Banzo but I'd take some of the effusive praise it receives with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"What took me so long to go to the brick and mortar location?  I have been to the food cart before, but this was so much better.  Started with a tasty curry soup and then the F Bomb Platter.  Everything I tasted was delicious.  It is a combination of service / self-service though.  You order at the front counter, they bring your order to you, and you buss your own table.  That didn't bother me though, as the food was so tasty I didn't mind one bit.  

I am reserving the fifth star for more visits - as I only tasted a small portion of the menu - but I have high hopes to be back soon and be even more impressed."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! I ordered delivery via GrubHub. My food arrived 30 minutes early. The food was packaged perfectly and cooked perfectly too. I had the falafel sandwich with hand-cut chips (and I also ordered salad to eat for the next meal). The falafel was crispy.. The salad in the sandwich was fresh... The potato chips very crispy and not oily at all. 
It's just one of those places that pay attention to details and clearly take pride in their food. Love. Love. Love this place! Please come to DC!"}
{"text":"When I think of this place, the words fresh and yum come to mind.  I've visited the physical location and the food carts various times.  Despite the variety of menu, I'm still a sucker for the tasty \"Banzo\" wrap which is well balanced and fairly filling.  I will recommend eating it sooner than later as the pita's bottom gets a big soggy the longer you wait.   The F-bomb is legit too.  And for the food carts, target lunch on the early side of things as they've often been short of or out of falafel balls - which are obviously a key ingredient.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Undeniably the best bang for your buck in the city. For under 10 bucks, you can get SO MUCH food, and it's all full of yum. But above all else, I need to pay my respects to the falafel. After going to other restaurants, and trying to make it at home, I can say that I haven't had any falafel comparably as good as Banzo's. It just manages to have more flavor, more crunch, and also isn't nearly as dry as other ones i've had. Basically, it's perfection, and the envy of every other place in town. That, and the fact that I can get it on west and east campus for lunch in addition to their restaurant (which has a great patio area, btw) makes it a top tier place to get a meal."}
{"text":"I grew up in the middle east, eating some of the best and authentic falafels, hummus and tahini. I trust my middle eastern childhood to spot a good falafel and Banzo scores! The first thing I look for in a falafel is for a crunchy exterior with the green goodness of a parsely infused batter. I am more partial to the batter made of Garbanzo beans as opposed to that made with Fava beans.
Banzo gets it bang on with the color and texture. I have had many a falafel in the US with pale interiors due to the absence of the parsley. An authentic looking falafel, Banzo's falafels make you feel good all the way through!. The flavor is near perfect and close to authentic, a bit more parsley and you would be transported into the lands of Arabia!. 

The sandwiches are a perfect complement to the falafel. I often have The Banzo and The Harvest both of which are a burst of color and flavor. I prefer The Harvest, for the addition of the pan seared eggplant slices. Juicy and tender, the perfectly cooked eggplant certainly pairs well with the crunchy falafel. I have had my share of charred eggplant in my sandwich, but I am willing to look over that one isolated incident. Once you have bitten into the sandwich and enjoyed every bit it, the heaviness of the sandwich sinks in!. For $7.95, the Harvest is as good as it can get and satisfying to the T. A personal suggestion would be to buy the sandwich from their food cart or dine in, something is a miss with the sandwich when it is delivered home.

 While their hummus lacks the small yet bold statement made by the tahini added to it (the authentic hummus has tahini play a small yet significant role in its flavor), Banzo's hummus is creamy and delicious. Pair it up with pita chips, or lick it off your fingers, either ways the hummus is truly enjoyable.

Banzo is certainly as authentic as it can get! Crispy and fresh, the plain looking, unassuming food certainly rules your palate with flavor. Banzo manages to appease my longing for middle eastern food without insulting my arabian memories. My only suggestion is if they could add a mint lemonade to the menu, which is traditionally paired with the falafel."}
{"text":"My kebab pita was awesome but my wife's schnitzel was dry & flavorless. Service was fast & friendly. Atmosphere at the Sherman St locale is cool as heck...between the menu & decor, I love that this place does what it wants, and not what is expected."}
{"text":"don't count on their food truck being open when they say it will be or even at the location they post on their social media handles. they really should delete all their social media because it only cuts time out of lunch breaks for people who work on the square, get there only to have the dudes smoking cigs tearing it trying to make a point to simultaneously show you they are cool, but totally not give a crap. 
banzo is run by bogus people."}
{"text":"After trying their Food cart which was delicious i tried the place on sherman with a group of people. The order was messed up we ordered in they had made it to go when we inquired after waiting 30 minutes they just went back and then brought out the cold falafels. It was a bad experience I did not go back until today 6 months later and ordered the falafel and the pita was hard on one side and soft on the other the falafel tasted ok but nothing to rave about. I love falafel and have had it in israel. I hesitate to go back again as Madison needs places like this but I was very disappointed. Doubt i will be back."}
{"text":"Very few places can keep up a high standard of food. This place does it. It is fresh, it is delicious and it does not disappoint. I receive the same quality each and every time I go back."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Blown away. I would reccomend something on the menu, but everything is spectacular. Definetly would try this place!"}
{"text":"I had never tried falafel before stumbling across Banzo- it changed my culinary worldview! I love love love their stuff, and they are always so friendly to boot. I just wish they would come back to their previous spot at South campus occasionally where I used to be able to get lunch. Please open a storefront!

*edit* Oh, I see that they do have a stationary location on Sherman Ave., and they deliver! Yay!"}
{"text":"I had their food on a food truck one day.  And then I met some friends here for dinner last week.  This is as good as it gets, folks!  Fresh tasting and delicious food.

Not much to say that hasn't already been said.  But overall, everything was just top-notch."}
{"text":"I had been craving good Mediterranean food and was not disappointed at all. You walk in, order at the counter, and then either take-out the food, or sit at one of the tables in the back room. It is pretty small, but a very cute place. Also, they have GREAT gluten-free options (Mostly everything there is gluten-free besides the pita bread, even the falafel). I ordered the F-Bomb platter (half Falafel, half Chicken), and it was awesome. The hummus was very fresh (same with the other sides). 

Nothing bad about this place, at all. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"During a recent visit to Madison I stopped at Banzo for diner before heading home to Wausau - it was a great choice! Everything was fresh and delicous!

The falafel really is as tasty as the reviewers say. I got the Banzo pita which was a great deal, a nice large portion. We did the 3 sides for $10 and enjoyed the babaganoush, hummus and couscous tabouli. I think I could eat that couscous tabouli everyday, it was so good!

Banzo was a nice treat that I will take advantage of again when I am visiting Madison."}
{"text":"I am very picky about falafel. This place nails it. We had two f-bomb pita with tahini and hot sauce. Amazing. Seriously eat here. They deliver also which was a welcome find also."}
{"text":"Two years later, I remain obsessed with this Madison gem. You just can't beat their falafel. Half of the time I'm in Madison, I get Banzo and the other half of the time I wish I was eating it.

My favorite will remain the F-Bomb platter. The platter contains the coveted falafel, juicy/flavorful chicken, hummus, cucumber salad and rice. I like the option of white or wheat pita bread...very thoughtful. The tahini and spicy sauces are both perfect additions.

Since last review: Visited their brick and mortar location on Sherman. Great atmosphere -- laid back and comfortable. Patio is nice too.

I had the falafel this weekend and I'm still thinking about it..."}
{"text":"Quick review : good on some thing, great one one, and not so great on others. 

Humus and pita bread was great!!!

Beer was good. Yes they have beer and wine but it is not on their menu

The meat was not good. I got the Schnitzel (bread fried chicken) and it was very dry and I did not care for the breading.  

The people I with which I was dining gave good reports, so I bumped this up to a 3 vs. a 2.  I may try again and I will definitely get the humus and pita again (very good)."}
{"text":"What is there not to like about Banzo? 
It is exactly what Madison needs more of! I have to honestly say, the best falafel I have ever had.
The pita's they are using go beyond the word \"good\". More like amazing! Fresh, soft, & tasty making me always asking to come back for more! 
The marinated chicken is fantastic!
The Schnitzel pita is one of favorites! I really enjoy that each bite I take is filled with a new surprise....Is it going to be relish? Chicken? or Tahini sauce...it is all so good.

They have a great outdoor patio also. You can find the perfect amount of shade on a beautiful sunny afternoon day here. Plus, as a added bonus, they always have out fresh cucumber water. It's great!

The staff (and owners) are awesome people, making every experience here better than the last. 

One of my favorite restaurants in Madison!"}
{"text":"The food cart is better than the restaurant in my experience. I worked on state street and ate at the food cart almost every day I loved it I always got the harvest. I've been to the restaurant twice and it just doesn't compare. The hummus and pita is always on point. No complaints there best in town that I've had. But the rice and falafel is always cold and hard while the eggplant is really hot. The food truck everything was equally hot and just so good I was seriously addicted"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. They have great staff at both the restaurant and food truck. I always get the f bomb with chicken and it's amazing!!! Fresh and always delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm speechless.
Fantastic food...... Best Mediterranean food I've had.
Chicken shawarma F bomb pita... And falafel. To die for...don't miss out."}
{"text":"Food is great but they need to ditch the food cart ethos and hire servers"}
{"text":"Oh my god. Amazing falafel. Tasty pita. What more can you ask for?!?! I was so ridiculously full after stuffing my face with this portable awesomeness (aka The Banzo pita sandwich) but boy was I happy. No regrets."}
{"text":"I checked out their indoor location on Sherman Ave. Simply amazing! If you're looking for great Mediterranean in Madison for around $10 (not including drinks/extras) this is the spot to be. My friends and I managed to order different things from the menu and loved all of them."}
{"text":"We've had catering from Banzo at my office several times. A couple times, we each ordered our own meal. In that scenario, I've gotten the banzo pita sandwich, banzo hummus plate, and banzo platter (all are vegan and the \"banzo\" refers to falaffel.) They mark their vegan options and make it very easy. We've also gotten family-style catering, which was also very vegan-friendly. In fact, it included vegan rice, cous cous salad, falaffel, hummus, and pita, and the only non-vegan item was the chicken they also served. I love their food so much! Some of the best hummus around in my opinion. Thanks for making great food and labeling it clearly! I will always encourage my office to order Banzo for these reasons."}
{"text":"Banzo definitely lived up to it's reviews.  It's worth it to come here just for the falafel alone.  But everything we had was good.  I got the F-bomb in a pita, and my wife got the fbomb hummus platter.  We also tried the fried cauliflower with herbed tahini.  We left full and happy."}
{"text":"Love the flavor this place packs into those little pita pockets! Their meats are seasoned so well. Don't skip on the hummus! It's the best around!"}
{"text":"5-star falafels (vegan) and 4 star hummus.  Prices are very cheap for the quality and quantity.  Their lunch-time food truck is the best choice for vegans staying around the capitol square.  We also stopped in at their restaurant location on the way out of town and ate way too much!

I'd give them a 5 star if only they had some type of dessert, preferably vegan, and preferably baklava."}
{"text":"I was there 2 mins before they close... The staff was really nice. The food is pretty good. I forgot to take a photo cause the food looks really good."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the last few weeks and really enjoyed the food and view the porch seating. They have nice little touches like adding cucumbers to the water. Excellent humus. I have tried the chicken kabobs and brisquit..both were a little salty, but the rest of the meal more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Food : Average with the exception of Falafal

Service : Non Existent as it's a purely help yourself place

A good Mediterranean place is known by a few key things IMO. The hummus, the baba ganoush, the falafel, the pita and the sharwma. This place does serve most of those but not really good ones.

Let's start with the GOOD. The Falafel's were fresh and fried to perfection just to ensure the right chewiness from the chickpeas. Pairing it with a tahini sauce which to me had a hint of Coconut was brilliant! A must try for anyone. The Hummus was very good and again fresh.

Now the REST. The Lamb platter, albeit in the form of Kofta (a version of Meatballs) were dry, somewhat overcooked and lacked a depth of flavor Mediterranean places are otherwise synonymous for!! The sauce was dangerously close to simply being one right out one of Olive Garden recipes for Marinara. The rice accompaniment was chewy and flavorless. The pita as average at best.

What really made a dent in our experience was the average food with an above average price ($15 per platter per person) and a bare bones service. The only thing they did that we didn't was to get our food from the kitchen to the table. That's it. No checking in on how were doing etc etc and taking around 30 mins just to get 2 mains on a almost empty afternoon. If I knew I was going to get Panera Bread service, I'd better pay Panera Bread prices! (By the way, I Love Panera Bread !! )

I know it's tad unfair to compare with past experiences, but we've had MUCH better and authentic Mediterranean food elsewhere. Not worth a second visit this one."}
{"text":"i rarely eat at the same place twice.  
partly cuz madison has so many great places and is always adding more, partly because i live so far away, partly cuz i'm a variety junkie.
but banzo....banzo blows that whole theory out of the water.

i keep going back!  AND i keep ordering the SAME thing!  GAH!  the harvest....friggin' amazing, lemme tell you why:
1. they know how to cook eggplant.
2. they know how to make falafel.  like my indian friend from india who had his own restaurant called ananda's in the dells and i was a server there and basically could've been paid in falafel instead of money it was that good and i've sorta had this little empty place inside ever since it closed [deep breath, pause for nostalgic flashback].  i've tried lots of falafel in lots of places to try to fill that void and have failed.....until now."}
{"text":"For those of you who are looking for a polished restaurant setting, I would stick to the food cart.  Located in a former house, it is definitely a fixer upper.  A curtain hides the kitchen area.  Space heaters are used to heat the room next to where the food is ordered.  While the amenities are pretty bare bones, the previous reviews are are on point.  The falafel is some of the best in Madison.  Hot, crispy with the perfect blend of spices.  As well, their hot sauce is killer.  But when you don't have a few menu items (on a Monday at 11:45 am), you have to get knocked down a star.  While this may have been a one time thing, it is something that needs to be addressed for those customers (ie. Moi) who really have no other reason to cruise the Fordem Ave. corridor but to eat there....."}
{"text":"Great food truck!  I had the F bomb and loved it!  The girl serving me was happy and helpful."}
{"text":"Heads up: Banzo is now set up on the State Street Mall outside University Bookstore and Memorial Library, not on Charter & Dayton. They're usually open 11-2:30 M-F.

I've heard rave reviews about Banzo in local newspapers, and I finally got to try some falafel today...oh my god. Hands down, the best falafel I've ever had. It was so crispy and perfectly seasoned, and then it got all warm and delicious on the inside. And so fresh, I even found part of an actual garbanzo bean inside one of my falafel balls, rather than the usual green mush. AND it was only $3 for 4 of them! Throw in some fruit and veggies, and for me, it was the perfect size for lunch.

Two thumbs up for Banzo. Can't wait to try the chicken pita sandwich and the fries. Om nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Love this place. I ordered F Bomb sandwich and so did my husband. It was awesome. Got a side of hummus and pita. That too was great. Look forward to warmer weather so we can eat outside at their restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm giving Banzo 5 stars because I crave and day dream about their falafel and hummus.

I've been here 5+ times and have had really good service every time and the food is simply prepared but excellent

How to order: 
1. Choose your protein- 
I highly recommend the Banzo, the Schnizel, and the chicken shawarma (when they have it). I'm not crazy about their beef kabas, I don't like the texture, and were a little heavy on the cumin in particular.

2. Choose your preparation- 
My favorite is the hummus plate, but the platter is also good and comes with a salad and rice in addition to hummus. The Salad is huge and has tons of toppings, the dressing, however, is not very flavorful.

They have self-serve water stations that are usually infused with some kind of citrus. Which I think is a nice touch. I'm a sucker for lemon mint water :)"}
{"text":"I really like Banzo but they can be inconsistent. I've had the Harvest sandwich made three or four different ways at this point. Also my takeout tonight lacked certain ingredients (like the famous potato chips). The hummus was everywhere and very liquidy. They are good but I'd prefer more consistency!"}
{"text":"Banzo falafel is good - no - excellent. Really freaking good. I am happy they exist and deliver. The tabouli was weird - like eating a mint plant. But back to the falafel, so good."}
{"text":"I'll save the suspense - Banzo just became one of my favorite lunch stops in Madison! Wowzers, Shiver My Timbers and Great Googly Moogly this food is FANTASTIC!!! I've never tried this food cart before although I have passed it at least 100 times walking to different eating venues. I fancy myself a \"Falafel Aficionado\" and have eaten a lot of it (I haven't had anything in Madison that comes close to NYC falafel) and read that a certain sandwich here made a Top 15 to try in Madison. Count me in - I've accepted the mission...

I was greeted immediately and asked what I was ordering. The F-Bomb Pita on a white pita was the choice. Super quick service. Like \"Man, that was so fast I think it isn't going to be good because it must be pre-made\" quick. I watched the pita get sliced (nice skills!) and watched the entire sandwich get made so I can confirm these are definitely not pre-made. For what its worth I wasn't the only one ordering so I am thinking they are that fast, or close to it, all the time. Very, very good service!

Onto the F-Bomb. It came in a cardboard holder and was piled high with F-Bomb content. I'm a saucy guy (not like that) so got a container of the three sauces offered - white, red and tan (if you get NYC falafel you get the reference). The white was a yogurt sauce that was fantastic. Tan was tahini. I'd say this was my least favorite. It was definitely flavorful just not what I wanted. The red was the chili sauce and it absolutely is an upper-deck home run. The red and white compliment each other nicely. I am assuming the red sauce is made from scratch - well done, Banzo! Well done!

The sandwich had marinated chicken, two falafel balls, an array of vegetables and potato chips. The flavor of the chicken was great - it had depth and tons of impact. Cooked very well and high food cart quality. The falafel were A+. The flavor, consistency, freshness and fried \"shell\" are perfect.They hold up to the sauce and made me smile. I've had many, many different falafel in Madison and these are by far the best. If we're talking percentage points, Banzo's falafel beat all of the others combined by double figures. I think the sandwich is tough to eat \"by hand\" so make sure you grab a fork. Eating it with a fork also provides an experience that I don't think you can get if you eat it with your hands. The different layers really hit the mouth differently when eating it. Chicken, vegetables, falafel, vegetables, potato chips... Wait, potato chips? In my falafel sandwich. Who the heck thought this would be a great idea... wait a second... pin my tail and call me a donkey this is great!!! Fresh potato chips that add something you can't find in any other falafel sandwich - CRUNCH! Lastly, the pita has weight, substance and is chewy with hints of charred spots. It all comes together in a way that makes your brain scream to the rest of your body \"THIS IS YUMMY - We'll be back!!!\". Again, well done Banzo! Well done!

I'm trying to find something bad to say but I can't. The price tag ($8.00) is justified. The portions are good. I haven't found a \"genre matching\" food cart that comes close on flavor. This is another 5 star food cart!

Banzo adds to the expansive Madison Food Cart scene and I believe they deserve to be known as one of the best. I'll bring my own little gold star for them the next time I come and try one of their other amazing offerings (which will be soon)!"}
{"text":"For your fix of falafel and hummus, look to Banzo. They've got a brick and mortar that delivers, plus a couple of food carts. I have yet to stop in to their restaurant, but I've ordered delivery a couple of times and have visited the food cart a couple times as well.

Things that are great:
- Soft, pillowy pita 
- Smooth and flavorful hummus
- Falafel that stays crisp, even when delivery takes awhile
- Introducing pickles on a falafel sandwich into my life
- Really amazing spiced fries that somehow held up through being delivered

In addition to their stellar falafel sandwich options, they've got some really tasty marinated chicken and a few other items that you can deliver to your mouth via pita or in the form of a platter with rice and salad. 

My main small critique is that some serving sizes seem a little off for the cheapest things. The pita sandwiches are huge, but you get literally about a tablespoon of sauce with them in a teeny, tiny cup. Fine for the hot sauce, but such a big serving could definitely use more yogurt so you can have it in every bite. Same with the hummus side. You get an entire container of their amazing hummus, but four small pita slices to go with it. For me, one pita got me through about a third of that amazing hummus. 

I now know to order extra pita and sauce, but considering the serving sizes it'd be great if the order just came with enough to begin with."}
{"text":"Horrible service.....kept putting me on hold or not answering or hanging up on me. Finally placed order to rude girl and food when arrived was terrible. My fried chicken platter was burnt....the baklava 'a were dried out. And they were out of many things when I placed my order. Refunded me for burnt chic but not nasty baklava or disgusting babaganoosh. Will never order from here again and I suggest you don't unless you enjoy poor quality service and food!"}
{"text":"Terrific falafel + delivery = awesome"}
{"text":"I may be a little bit embarrassed to admit that in my 4 years at UW, I've never went to the Banzo food cart on Library Mall, and the only times I've had Banzo is when they catered! On the plus side, I did have Banzo catering twice :) 

Their rice, hummus and falafel is A.M.A.Z.I.NG. I wish I could have a giant tray of their falafels with me at ALL TIMES to snack on. They're so crunchy and fresh and flavorful and I could go on and on about them! 

Once I go to their food cart, I'll have to post an updated review. But for now, just take my word that their catering is so good, I would absolutely have them cater to any of my events!"}
{"text":"No reviews have mentioned the \"Schnitzel\", which is chicken breast pounded in delicious breading, then fried - like Weiner Schnitzel is made, except with chicken! I had it in the Salad configuration, and it was absolutely delicious! I'm sure it would be wonderful in the other offerings as well.

I love the falafel (\"Banzo\"), but I've also ordered the \"Chick\" and \"Slider\", and now the \"Schnitzel\", and I only write to emphasize that it's not just the falafel that makes this my new favorite place for take-out/delivery!"}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed here at Banzo or their food cart.  Simply fresh, housemade ingredients.  If you're craving Mediterranean, Banzo's the only place to go in my opinion!!"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant location on Sherman. Excellent falafel and hummus"}
{"text":"The falafel and other vegetarian items may be good here, but the brisket salad was awful and should be taken off the menu. It was terribly salty. Also there were not many olives or cheese on my salad. I thought it was overpriced for what I got.

The best thing about this restaurant is its outdoors porch dining. I will not return."}
{"text":"Went here with a  friend a few weeks ago for dinner. The food was fantastic.  I ordered the platter with falafel and eggplant.  The falafels were delicious and flavored well.  The eggplants was great to dip in the homemade hummus, which was also tasty.  The weakest part of the dish was the side salad, which was a little bland/plain.  Service was fast, even for a Friday night.  I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The best restaurant food I've eaten to date in Madison. The falafel is absolutely heavenly! A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"I really like Banzo. The food is fresh, tasty, and reasonably well-priced. Their pita is out of this world. 

I'd like to give this place five stars, but there are a few things holding me back:

- What they call \"brisket\" is not what anyone would reasonably expect brisket to be. It's more of a dry, pastrami-like smoked meat. To be honest, it's pretty nasty. 

- They don't give you enough pita with the hummus plate or side of baba ganoush. 

- They have three really tasty sauces. If you order at the cart, you can douse your sandwich to your heart's content. If you order delivery, though, you only get one tiny little cup of each of them. Given how the sandwich is constructed, it just doesn't work. You take one bite and the sauce is gone. Total buzzkill. 

- Nutrition information would be really nice. I never know if falafel is a healthy option or a calorie bomb."}
{"text":"I have walked past the Banzo trailer for months without even knowing about the goodness that is the F-bomb. (I have to admit I thought they were selling those pork buns because their logo looks like that.) Finally, after reading tons of adoring reviews  I ordered the F-bomb pita with chicken. It 100% lived up to it's five-star reputation. The falafel was bursting with garlicky spice flavors and the cabbage added a nice, crunchy texture. I have to say that the falafel out-shined the chicken here. The chili sauce you can add yourself delivered a zingy kick and the tahini dill sauce cooled things down. It was a filling and convenient meal for $8."}
{"text":"Highly recommended for all Mideast food enthusiasts.  Even the falafel tastes good when cooled to room temperature.  The tabbouleh is fresh."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many a time.  I used to get it delivered at my old job, and then recently was lucky enough to work only 1 block away.  Would visit once a week or so and get the Chicken Pita.  A great flavored grilled chicken, I ordered it with the whole wheat pita.  Topped with some cucumber sauce and hot garlic chili sauce makes it perfect.

Would highly recommend it!  Reasonably priced at $8 for a whole pita."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I have only ever ordered from their food card or delivery. And that I consistently hear good things about this place from people I know in the food industry. And they seem like really nice folks. And so please take this with that grain of salt. 

I've tried, Banzo. I really did. I want to like you. I hear you are great. But you keep letting me down. Did I do something wrong?  The falafel was rock hard and dry once, and burnt the next time. The tabouli was horribly unbalanced and swimming in oil. The tsatziki was bland, and the tahini was.. salty? I think I have caught these guys on bad days.  

But the staff is super nice, the prices are reasonable, and it smells amazing. I can tell my falafel would have been delicious if it was not stale/burnt. I think perhaps this is a gem where you should not order it delivery, and stick to the restaurant rather than the cart."}
{"text":"Banzo's chicken is so flavorful and tasty! I loved everything about the Chick Platter - from the chips, to the hummus, rice and salad and the whole wheat pita bread."}
{"text":"Overall the food itself was great. However, the amount of food for the price was not.

The sandwiches are decently sized but the platters comes with very little rice and pita. It's a good choice if you're looking to splurge, but not if you're looking for a quick cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Great f-bomb as usual. Great hummus. Took a while for meal to come and wasn't busy. Madison staple."}
{"text":"Super delicious. I prefer the restaurant over the cart--it seemed more fresh--but it is a lot more food because they don't do half orders. Staff at the restaurant are very friendly and patient with people new to Banko's. I'd recommend the F-bomb platter--that way you get to sample everything."}
{"text":"Eh...overcooked, tough schnitzel. Bland salad could use some salt, oil, and lemon. It also came with 3 cc of yogurt and 3 cc of tahini in some very small condiment cups (that's 0.101442068 US fluid ounces for those of you who prefer freedom units). I also got one and a half chips, which was a nice added touch. Boring but ultimately palatable. Delivery was free."}
{"text":"Between the adorable outdoor seating area, friendly staff, and outstanding falafel, Banzo is an easy Madison favorite."}
{"text":"Easy review...  The f-bomb with chicken was awesomely tasty!  Perfect place for lunch!  Fast and friendly service.  I ordered the pita the other two in my group ordered platters and we all walked away satisfied."}
{"text":"I've been to the food cart a handful of times. Food is always quality and you get a good mix of textures and flavors in the pita sandwiches - crunchy salad and chips, smooth hummas, soft-on-the-inside-crunchy-on-the-outside falafel (or tender chicken or both), and some nice acidity via the pickles. It's really everything you could ask for in a quick filling lunch sandwich. The only downside is that it doesn't magically appear whenever I need to fill my belly during the day."}
{"text":"Overlooking lake Manona is this authentic cuisine, serving food with the right amount of Mediterranean spice. Amazing ambience with happy staff and customers. Treat for humus and Baba-ganoosh lovers!!
Four stars for pricy food otherwise it deserves five."}
{"text":"Had \"The Harvest\" today at the Farmer's Market. It was very delicious. The only downside was the two boys in the truck were not prepared for the rush they got and the service was incredibly slow. The flavor was worth the wait, though."}
{"text":"If someone were to ask me about the best thing I've recently ate, I'd say it's Banzo's falafel. 
I didn't have them in pita. Just the balls a la carte.
Now I get why people love this place. These super fluffy inside, crispy-outside falafel are the best that I've ever had anywhere. I thought I had sampled some of the finest falafel a from SF Bay Area to Paris, but I am happy to report that Banzo's falafel wins the title of \"the best.\""}
{"text":"Love it! It's a nice quick, inexpensive & tasty. I love hear the staff try to figure out ways to attract more hipsters."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about ten times since they opened on Sherman, and this was the first time they made a mistake on my order. It hardly mattered. The food is uniformly divine, and I cleaned my plate anyway.

The Chick platter is my go-to favorite. The chicken chunks are all meat, well flavored without a hint of greasiness, the saffron rice and lentils subtly spiced and comforting, the chopped salad with shredded cabbage, lettuce, diced tomato and cucumber with a light vinaigrette is refreshingly crisp, the pita bread crusty outside and tender within, and the butter-smooth hummus is simply off the chain delicious. Tzatziki and spicy hot pepper sauce are great add ins if that's your thing (it's my thing).

The beer selections are nice, and there are a million other soft drink options. You order at the counter, which keeps the price low. It's a small space, and was full when I arrived at 8 pm on Thursday night. However, I was soon (within 5 minutes) seated at a table for two in the corner, which was perfect. The lighting is low but not too low, music is a mix of Mediterranean and eclectic, and is kept at a medium/low volume, adding to the relaxing aura of the place.

Fresh, delicious healthy dinner, low price, friendly staff that doesn't hover. Doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Best hummus and falafel around town!  If you want a really great place for lunch, you've got to check Banzo out!  The food is very fresh and service is speedy.  It is a self serve place, where you order up at the counter and seat yourself.  It is one of those places you don't go to for the service, but rather for the authentic, delicious food!  There is something for everyone and I guarantee you won't leave hungry!  Also, this place is one of those places you would snap pictures for instagram, lovely flowers outside and just a cute little artsy-hole in the wall place.  Totally reminds me of what Madison is all about!!"}
{"text":"MMmmm!  Banzo aims to please and does so wonderfully!  Their cute little restaurant on Sherman Ave is adorable and now serves wine!  The owners are always coming up with exciting specials that always taste delicious.  The pita wraps are all tasty and very filling."}
{"text":"I've had the food cart food a few times. The hummus is pretty darn delish. There sauces are really great and a must to add to your take-out. I'm also a fan of their falafel too. Crunchy on the outside and plenty of flavor bursting on the inside. I like that they have 'plate or sammie' options. The only thing is that the lines for food can get pretty long and sometimes it's impossible to wait for your food during your lunch break. The service has always been on point. Usually it's about $7-10 for lunch."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I never really got the hype about falafel until today. It's always been mediocre in my opinion. So when I heard all about banzo and the hype around it, it wasn't my first food cart of choice. 

Which makes me sad. Because today's f-bomb was f-bomb drop worthy amazing. It's a great combination of falafel AND chicken, so you don't have to fully commit to the falafel. The pickles, the yogurt sauce and the hot sauce... all intertwined with the salad, chicken and falafel... wow. Get it. Please get it. 

The full portion left a very hungry me perfectly satisfied. Not to full, yet not still hungry. Lunch nirvana.

Also to note, if you don't dig spicy, lay off the hot sauce. It can be overwhelming if you don't dig spicy."}
{"text":"Great food cart fair!

I used to get this when I worked on campus -- the food cart is awesome and they post their location on twitter."}
{"text":"Ate a whole lot of Banzo over a 3 year period, due to everyone at my work loving it. I while, not thrilled at first, started to come around to the flavors of Banzo. Eventually I even came to somewhat enjoy my Banzo, and now I can officially say that Banzo is A-OK."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something light and heaven forbid, semi-healthy.  Blasphemy, I know, especially in the cheese and beer capital of the US but it does happen, I suppose.

Thanks to Sarajane's post, I ordered the Chick platter with salad.  It was a towering plate of salad with greek olives, feta, mixed greens, cucumbers, chickpeas and all sorts of other goodies.  The chicken itself would have been a great meal but mixing it with the salad was super satisfying!!  

It was the perfect day to sit on their porch and bask in the late September sunshine.  Where else can you find a deck like this?  The service was also very friendly.  They were willing to explain to us exactly what we were ordering, and the food came out quick.  

Yeah, it is nummy.  No arguing that."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin?!  Other than to say they have the best hummus...EVER!  And the falafel is so tasty and delish.  Probably the best I have ever eaten too.  I've never gone to the outdoor cart but I have ordered quite a few times from the restaurant on Sherman Ave.  Every time the order is hot, fresh and tastes superb.  I've recruited a few people to try Bonzos and they love it now too!  If this place is not on your to-do list, it should be!  Come on...text your friends, tell them to meet you there. Go.  Do it.  Now."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in Saturday afternoon after a 30 mile bike ride.  I had only ever eaten from the famous bright green food cart or ordered Eat Street delivery.  
The outdoor porch was the perfect spot to not only lock up our bikes and keep an eye on them; but the shaded breezy deck was just the reprieve we were seeking! Apparently all the other five groups of biking friends who followed after us had the same idea!! 
As we walked inside the allure of what was to come intrigued my friend (first time \"Bazo-er\") In spite of the busyness at the time of our visit, our orders were taken promptly by an angel faced young lady at the counter and she told us to seat ourselves anywhere outside and they'd bring our food when it was ready. 
We found a great table by our bikes and helped ourselves to the delicious fruited water which was in a self-serve canister outside as well as inside. It was exhilarating; possibly more so after the 30 mile ride but hey... AÈ stato delizioso! 
About ten minutes later our Herculean plates arrived! (See pic) we both ordered the \"F bomb platter\" and it did NOT disappoint! The marinated chicken was spot on, the fresh chopped salad crunch and lightly dressed, the snappy lightly seasoned homemade crisps, celebrated hummus, and aromatic rice and lentil pilaf..all ambrosial; and the star of the platter in my humble opinion- the falafel-two perfectly golden brown, crunchy, seasoned, golden stellar flavored falafel! Oh, and the half pita was the best homemade pita ever had!! 
Every last bite savored and relished. 
Highly recommend Banzo and Shuk (the later is temporarily closed/only doing catering currently) 
They have never let me down; food is consistently fresh, delicious, and will leave you craving your next time I promise!"}
{"text":"Madison being a college town, I didn't have high expectations for the food here. And generally speaking, I think my lowish expectations were appropriate. However, it's good to be pleasantly surprised sometimes, and Banzo did the job for me. They didn't provide the best falafel that I've ever had, and they had to take some necessary food truck shortcuts (like not cooking to order), but the falafel was tasty and the service was good. Banzo dished my first and arguably best meal in town."}
{"text":"I've tried the food cart a few times in the past, but recently used them for catering. We had their salad option, which included chicken, falafel, mixed greens, hummus & pita wedges, dressing, olives and a chopped salad. Other than the fact most were confused about what to do with the options (does the chopped salad sit on its own or belong on top of something), it was a hit as a light, savory lunch. The smells mezmerized everyone. Delivery was prompt and professional, and price was good. I'd use them again, especially when there is a significant number of vegetarian folks. They always get the short end of the catering stick, and this was a nice treat for them. The meat eaters were happy with the flavorful chicken and everything was nice and warm when delivered, without getting soggy (my fear)."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, and yes! Lunch at Bonzo has never disappointed me, and today was absolutely THE best execution and taste of food at this hidden gem. You could actually taste how fresh the lemon was in the tahini sauce, they have the most savory and moist falafel balls anywhere. They are so fresh they're green inside! I'm pretty sure they're green in color from the spices or herbs that are used, but it gives a fun impression of freshness that actually translates truthfully through the taste of the food. I took a little video of the hummus because I thought the artistic nature of the presentation was so cool (maybe they didn't even think of it in the kitchen but the way the food looks as you are eating it actually is really aesthetically pleasing). 
Until next time!"}
{"text":"The best place in madison to get med food. I get the F-Bomb every time and it is absolutely delicious. It's a lovely little restaurant with just a couple tables giving it an intimate feel to it. The staff are always incredibly friendly and helpful! I would recommend without a doubt, I think it is absolutely perfect and a great example of Madison's culture."}
{"text":"Just days ago I swore off takeout food. I'm a pretty healthy, whole-food eater and it seems like whenever I order out it's a) not *really* what I wanted and b) a ticket to the sodium spiral of doom where within minutes I feel like a slug that someone has poured salt over, followed by a day-long stomach ache as punishment for my sins.

Another late work night led me back to campusfood for one final foray. I saw Banzo as a new listing and decided to give it a go. Heck with it, I even ordered fries. This never turns out well, so I might as well go down in glory. I also ordered the chick pita sandwich...still being a slave to healthy eating conscience.

My order arrived quickly, well within the 45 minutes I'd been quoted. The delivery guy was super nice (eye contact is a big thing with me, and I worry when people who handle my food won't give it). But by far the most outstanding part was the food itself.

The combo of ingredients on the pita was definitely not something I'd have thought of on my own. I was a little concerned initially with adding chips to the sandwich itself, but they weren't soggy like they could have been if my food had sat around for long. And the box is a super cool method of delivery. I didn't need to transport it much further than bag to mouth, but it helped keep the heaping bundle of yummy in control.

Much to my surprise, the hand cut fries WEREN'T greasy or too salty! They had a great combo of spices--I didn't even bother with dipping sauces, though I did try a little of the ones provided.

The only complaint I can even come up with is that I ordered the hot sauce and it wasn't very hot. There were jalapeno pieces in it, but they were pretty tame. That said, I have an iron mouth, so maybe for everyone else it's hot. Though now that I think back on it, I don't know if I would have wanted it hotter. 

So campufood.com, thank Banzo for saving you a customer. I think they're my new Thursday ritual!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Banzo 5 stars even though their customer service sucks - see their response to my first review where I'm told to order again but given no incentive (discount? Free dessert? Can of soda?? Just hint that I matter) to do so -  because Madison's food scene is terrible but Banzo is actually good. Not good for Madison but legitimately flavorful, and they're consistent. 

I really don't like giving them my money because I'm used to places that want you to come back, but when you're desperate for well-spiced, healthy-ish food, Banzo is one of the few places you can count on in the city. So you win Banzo, by virtue of being a big fish in a small, unseasoned chicken pond. 

Don't order the hummus plate, ever, and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean food in Madison. It also has the best Hummus and falafel I have ever had."}
{"text":"OMG how have I not reviewed Banzo till now. I have dreams about their amazing falafel. I've only ever eaten the falafel pita and only from the Banzo cart that used to be by Union South. Soooo authentic and delicious, and very fresh. And the sandwich is huge! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My encounter with Banzo was inspired solely on a craving for falafel and a whim as I passed their food cart on Dayton St. They only take cash -- so I had to defer but I'm glad my craving won out and I stopped by.

The falafel was crisp without being burnt and exactly the right flavor that good falafel should be-- you could taste the chick peas clearly, the spicing was noticeable, great, but not overpowering so it ultimately balanced out very well. It was also decidedly inexpensive. I don't know that it made the food taste better but it definitely makes me feel better about indulging!

I also ordered their chicken pita (just a half so I didn't explode) and that was every bit as good as the falafel. They didn't overload it with vegetables, just enough so that you got a little bit of the vegetables, you got their marinade (which is amazing), and the chicken. No ingredient felt like it was \"just there\"... it all worked together. The chicken, flavor aside, was delightfully tender.

All this from a cart, no less.

Needless to say I will *definitely* be coming back again."}
{"text":"Delicious.. Amazing falafel and \"the chick\" pita. Can't wait to try everything else.... Extra hot sauce and tahini sauce please!"}
{"text":"I had the Harvest platter and I hate to say it but I wasn't impressed. Maybe I went into it with too high of expectations given the past reviews. I felt the hummus had too much tahini and not enough other flavors and the falafel was over cooked. Furthermore, I wish they gave me more pita bread. The chili sauce was good though. Price wasn't terrible, but I just didn't think the quality was worth it. I probably won't buy from here again."}
{"text":"Mmmm, Banzo is my favorite food cart in Madison! 

Both the falafel platter and pita are delish! The platter comes with falafel (duh) plus salad and hummus. Both are amazing, and you can have them put all three of their delicious sauces on the platter. Yum! They serve the sandwich in a cool little box....pop open the top and eat! 

Just found out via other Yelp review that they have a brick and mortar establishment. I must go!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best food trucks in town. Their falafel is gluten-free and they've given me a side of greens instead of a pita. Also, they deliver. Awesome! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I'm no falafel expert, but this is the best falafel I have ever had ever.  I'm not exaggerating and I'm not getting paid.  Crispy on the outside, flavorful, fresh flavor.  Not to mention the baba ganouj, the hummous."}
{"text":"There's no place like Banzo in Madison. From the homie atmosphere (the restaurant is literally in a house) to the great lit up deck to they're amazing food! No other place will satisfy your falafel craving like Banzo does."}
{"text":"Good food. We were driving through Madison and I was craving middle eastern food. Trusting my fellow yelpers, we headed to Banzo. I had the falafel platter and loved it. The hummus was outstanding. So was the fried eggplant. Really outstanding. I was a little disappointed with the rice though. It was a little dry. But overall a good platter. My son ordered the F Bomb and enjoyed his pita sandwich. My husband got the beef in pita and I am not sure if he enjoyed it as much as I thought or if he was humoring me and my falafel craviing. Anyway, it was a good place to stop. Lucky Madison! But the restaurant was underheated and cold. I get it that Banzo was built on food trucks but people who are coming to dine in want a little more comfort."}
{"text":"Just got lunch carry-out and it was awesome. Ordered the two pita sandwiches for $10 special and the three sides for $10 special. The  sandwiches were huge, the four felafel balls per sandwich were delicious as were the pitas and all ingredients, all FRESH and made while you wait. The hummus and babaganush and felafel balls sides with extra pitas were a meal for 2 in themselves. Located directly across from an enormous park...perfect place for a picnic or a date! Wonderful!"}
{"text":"First time trying and had it delivered. The presentation looks amazing and the entree was so good! The site said it will take an hour to deliver but they showed up in 30 minutes!! Wow! Highly recommend! Will order again! ;)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to enjoy a delicious lunch. Falafel is the best I've had in Madison and the menu, while not expansive, is packed with tasty variations on Mediterranean treats.

Low points - I'm not a fan of the baba ganoush, recipe is a little bland for my taste. Beef patties in pita can be a little on the dry side, same with the brisket. 

High points - pretty much everything else! The chicken shawarma in particular is moist, flavorful, and consistently great! The hummus is straightforward but very well executed with a perfect consistency. The pita is unbelievable and rumor has it its imported from Israel (which is a little tough to believe, but it's great in any event). Very comfortable and welcoming location with attentive staff and both inside and patio seating.

Love it. Will return often. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had recently moved into the neighborhood and still had no food in the house, so we decided to grab lunch from Banzo. I had the Banzo pita and my husband had the F-Bomb pita with kebab. They were HUGE! But most importantly delicious. I devoured the entire thing, even though one sandwich was enough food for two people. I will definitely be back, especially since it's just a quick walk away...and if I walk there that means I can gorge myself, right?"}
{"text":"No long review needed. Just eat here. Now. Seriously. Are you eating falafel yet? Is it awesome? Are your fries perfectly crispy and delicious? Yep, I thought so."}
{"text":"Oh Banzo, you kindled my love of falafel and changed my mind about hummus. This is one of my favorite take out joints, but the Patio here In the summer is great. 
I spent my whole life hating hummus. It was that weird gritty goo that my friends' hippie parents would try to pawn off as a snack. A few years ago, I was feeling brave and lazy so I didn't ask them to hold the hummus on my pits sandwich, and that was one of the better decisions I made that year. Banzo's hummus is a beautiful silky garlic-y sauce that compliments their falafel perfectly. Their falafel are basically perfect on their own, but the hummus takes it over the top. 
I believe this location delivers to the near east side, so if you want delivery or take out this is a great non-Chinese option."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean I've had in Madison so far. Get the F-Bomb, my personal favorite. Very unique Americanized versions of Mediterranean dishes. 

Love the location. Burrows Park right across Sherman - the quieter part of Sherman. And big ups on the patio. Can't say enough about a good patio. Good place to go for a cheap bite and relax!"}
{"text":"Banzo is the best restaurant in Madison. I wish I could give it a sixth star. It isn't anything fancy, and the pitas stuffed with enormous falafel balls can almost be difficult to eat, but the experience is completely justified by how delicious everything tastes. You can tell they pride themselves on the fresh ingredients and authentic flavors. I probably eat here at least once or twice a month."}
{"text":"What is Banzo? Probably Madison's best Israeli (and in my opinion, Middle Eastern) restaurant. The Felaffel is great as is the Shwarma. What I'd really like is to keep it more Israeli style. Don't be afraid to hide our roots, which it seems at times too many Israelis are willing to do. Also, as far as Authentic goes, add Limonona and Hafuch. Anyone who's ever lived in Israel knows what this is and Madisonians need to get in the bandwagon."}
{"text":"The food is consistently delicious & the service is friendly & efficient. A bunch of sweet hearts run this joint!! The sweet potato falafel is incredible & they cater to dietary restrictions for all the gluten-free vegans out there. Enjoy!! It's so good!!"}
{"text":"Best felafel in Madison my a very large margin. Their felafel and grilled eggplant sandwich is divine! In fact, it's so good that I've never even bothered to try anything else on the menu. It is a perfect sandwich."}
{"text":"Can't believe it's taken me so very long to try Banzo's falafels. I visited the cart at Library Mall. I've read so many wonderful raving reviews I decided I had better give them a try. I ordered the traditional falafel in pita bread. I was so disappointed. Ok, I'll start with the positive. The falafel balls were delightfully soft and moist inside. There was plenty of toppings included in the sandwich, like chopped salad, pickles, and your choice of sauce (yogurt, hot sauce, or tahini). My complaint: salty..... very, very salty falafels. I don't know if this was a fluke, or the norm. I kept hoping that biting into the plentiful garnishes would help disguise the saltiness, but no luck. I didn't find the usual contrasting flavors between the fried ball and condiments. Usually there's that happy dance of complementary differing flavors, but my taste buds never found that. Kept looking for the bright tangy accents. Salty falafel balls, salty pickles, and even salty chips were buried amongst the garnishes. But, hey, everyone else loves these guys though!"}
{"text":"I finally tried it!

The falafel is to die for, the hummus pretty good, and the salad/rice is standard. Overall, very affordable and tasty. I can tell why everyone loves it here.

I didn't love the eggplant; it was a bit greasy and tasted bitter.

The guy who rang me up was very helpful and friendly. I think it would be fun to stop back with friends and make a night of it. When I stopped by, I just grabbed lunch to go.

Definitely check it out. This place is a Madison staple. And vegetarian galore."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy! Stopped here on my way to class and had their falafel pita, called \"The Banzo.\" Falafel and pita were just perfect. They put pickles and homemade chips in the pita with a chopped salad that was cucumber, onion, tomato... and some other crunchy yumminess. Tahini and hot sauce to top it off. Wowie was good!! Oh, plus the fellas working there are super duper cute & sexy..."}
{"text":"Really good healthy food from a food truck on the square...Prices are good and service is quick!!  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Banzo pita sandwich and hand-cut fries... both were delicious. Probably the best falafel in Madison. The pita sandwich is way worth the $7. It is huge, the falafels are huge. it served as lunch and dinner for me. The fries were excellent as well. They were warm and crispy even though I got my food via delivery. The delivery dude was also very friendly and prompt. Bottom line: eat here."}
{"text":"Wow!  Super good food.  Our first time at Banzo.  My hubby went with the F-Bomb and I did the Chicken platter and followed up with a super soft Tahini cookie.  Super yummy.  We are on the patio to soak up the last few days left to do this in 2016.  Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Overall experience - 3 stars

We went on a Saturday afternoon, place was empty and everything is self serve kind of setting, you order at the counter with the menu written behind them on a chalk board. I was confused when I was asked tip before I even had my order, coz tip is something which I will decide how much I want to give based on the food and service I received. After that you can just find any empty seat inside or outside the restaurant at your convenience. The side order came in like 20 mins of wait and a few mins after that we were served our entrees. I did like part where you can grab your own cutlery, napkins and water. 
 
Now the food -

Falafel balls - 5 stars! loved them! Very fresh, crispy, perfect flavor and they came with a nice sauce pairing. 

Entree dish - lamb kofta platter 

$15 for the platter which includes 4 small flat lamb meatball/patty with mild tomato gravy, hummus, rice, salad, pita and chips 
I loved the hummus! Very homemade kind of a flavor. Lamb meat had nice flavor but didn't taste like Mediterranean which you would expect to have from a restaurant which served Mediterranean cuisine, it was just a lamb meatball with tomato gravy similar to marinara sauce. Pita was ok, the yellow rice served was tough, salad served was no big deal. The whole time while eating, we were the only ones in the restaurant sitting inside, and no one even once came to check up on us to see whether we need anything or the food is ok. Overall an OK experience. Would definitely give them another try for the swarma chicken and more falafel."}
{"text":"In the maze and confusion of food carts on Library Mall, it is easy to get lost in deciding which one to check out. That is, until you look over and realize that twice as many people are crowded around Banzo as compared with the other food options....Banzo it is!

After looking over the menu briefly, I settled on the \"F-Bomb\", which is a whole wheat pita sandwich of 2 falafel balls, grilled chicken, chopped salad, yogurt sauce, and tahini. Boy. I chose wisely. 

The falafel had a great taste to it and was hearty on its own, but when combined with the grilled chicken this became quite the delicious meal. The chopped salad of sorts and the various sauces that are added in complimented the marriage of the flavorfully satisfying falafel and stick-to-your-ribs chicken. 

This is the kind of food that you will insatiably, randomly crave. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Excellent falafel.   We had ours walking around capital square at the Farmers Market.  They will sell out.  They sold 150 by the time we got there and got the last few.  Delicious.    Today they were near Pinknew and King by walgreens."}
{"text":"I love these guys! They are so nice and the food is amazing. Not too expensive, either, and they always give samples! :)"}
{"text":"I lived for a few months in the Netherlands, and came back for few visits for some breaks and became a fan of doner kebab. Too bad, I couldn't find anything close to it here. But today, I gave Banzo a try (I had the F-Bomb with all the sauces) and IT WAS GOOD. 
I guess I will come to have it more often and  can see myself as a regular.

Too bad the service a bit sucked.  While the waiter was fine, the cashier was not friendly at all, while I tipped them quite generously :D :D Oh well, it may have been one of those days.

Today, I bought the second one. This time I got myself the Kebab. 
It's good but the F-Bomb is still THE BOMB. Now, I made up my mind: I will only get myself the F-BOMB. 

By the way, the cashier is another woman who is SUPER FRIENDLY. They should keep her!!!!! :))

Yelp didn't let me check in, the message said: I was too far away from that. Well, I only went to the truck at the library Mall.

So, yeah. I gave Banzo: 5 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love Banzo's falafal pita. A very filling pita with just the right amount of ingredients. And their lunch special is a great value. 

My wife and I have also ordered the F'Bomb, both the chicken and the beef patties, as a platter as well as the lentil soup. Most times the rice is very good but we have had a few times where the rice was a tad dry and flavorless. The hummus has always been consistently good and the option for a wheat pita is a definite plus. Most of the staff is pretty attentive aside from maybe one hostess/waitress whom I have experienced on several occasions having a personal conversation on the company phone in front of customers waiting to order. Very unprofessional. 

They always have some catchy tunes playing in the inside dining area. The outside dining area provides a spectacular sunset view.

Take out has been a breeze as has been delivery.

Would rate them higher if there was more consistency with quality and professionalism."}
{"text":"My husband has been looking for new places to try lately, and today we tried Banzo for lunch. The restaurant is a super cute converted house with an extensive and lovely patio. The folks working there were all super friendly and nice, and I was all like, \"I'll have what you're having\" about it.
So we both ordered the Banzo, which is a falafel extravaganza served pretty much however you could want it. We also shared an order of their incredible fries, which I'm told is an employee favorite on Fridays, which is as we all know is named after the goddess of deep frying. I'm pretty sure that's what I'm remembering from all those world religion books I have on the shelf.
Anyway.... these folks know how to french a fry. Skin-on, and most assuredly double-fried as Alton Brown has taught us. These geniuses then toss them in a mix of what I personally believe to be salt, pepper, dried thyme and smoked paprika. Most yummy.
Their falafel happens to be one of the best I've ever tasted, outside of my own. Perfectly golden brown and lovingly seasoned. There's a lovely fresh slaw consisting of cabbage, red peppers, pickles, onion, basil and cilantro, as I recall. They make a fine, light hummus to go with everything. I had the pita (my to go container is calling my name even now), while Brett had the platter, which features a yummy scoop of rice that I suspect is flavored with saffron and cinnamon and pine nuts. So good.
Banzo also operates a food truck, so if you see it, run right towards it and get your order in. The restaurant on Sherman is friendly and light and is an \"order at the counter\" experience. Love them, love their food.
Had to add a follow-up... their falafel pita is a magical dish. After letting the leftover half sit in the fridge for a few hours it became EVEN TASTIER. The seasonings in the falafel were more pronounced than when it was first brought to the table. That's how seeds and such work, but obviously, I was so enamored I had to write this paragraph. These folks know how to make tasty food."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place ever since I had the falafel from Taste of Madison! Saturday I got my chance. I ordered the F Bomb Platter with a glass of iced tea and everything was truly delicious. They have, hands down the best falafel that I have tried. The chicken shwerma was really good, along with the rice it is served with. The rice also contains lentils,which I really like. The platter is also served with a small salad and very soft pita and smoooooooth humus. The iced tea is awesome. Nope, not one bad thing can I think of...go there...soon"}
{"text":"ASTOUNDING falafel. Just how my friend's mom used to make it. Perfect texture- not dry, crumbly, or hard. Moist and just right. Always leaves you wanting more- especially with the house hummus and sauces. The people are just as awesome as the food."}
{"text":"Great falafel, hummus, and eggplant. Patio is a bit dated, but the shade is great. If you know a vegetarian, I would kindly force them to come here. I'm not as crazy about it when delivered, as the falafel are not quite as crispy after they cool. Big groups may have trouble getting a spot inside. Baklava is a wonderful treat here, just like my Greek aunt makes."}
{"text":"We came here based on all the rave reviews on yelp, Google, etc. I honestly have no clue what the fuss is all about. This was some of the worst Mediterranean food I've ever had in my life.

I ordered the chicken shawarma plate, my friend had the schnitzel,  and we split fried cauliflower with tahini.  My chicken was extremely dry, no flavor, and obviously not made in a traditional manner. Shawarma shares its origins with gyros and tacos al pastor, being roasted on a spit for hours. Generally BURSTING with flavor, and juicy. The salad was ordinary, the rice lacked any distinguishable flavor, the hummus was a tad gritty.

My friend's plate, the schnitzel,  followed suit,  was basically burnt and very dry.

The cauliflower was the only thing I'd consider repeating, that was decent but not a reason to return. 

Service was good, the counter person was very nice and helpful.

Decor was basically an old house with some paint splashed here in there, you could see it was is need of maintenance.  No coincidence, the lights were very low, I doubt you'd want to see the place in full light.

I so wanted to love this place, starting as a food cart, my friend is working on starting his own food truck, and this was research of a sort. If this food passes for good, he has nothing to worry about.

With their hundreds of 4-5 star reviews, I doubt they'll even care about mine, but I'm still dumbfounded as to why anyone would think this place was something to rave about."}
{"text":"If you like Mediterranean food this is your place.  We were meeting up with family.  Bunny and I and a few others were just getting into town so why not al meet up for lunch. 

In the end about 12 of us were meeting and this lace is sort of small.  They do have seating outside but it was a frosty -3 so that was NOT going to happen.  they also have another room and an upstairs location but they were working on the other room.

We waited for everyone to arrive and we were seated.  They had another large party there already but they found room for us.  We took menus down to see what we wanted then a few at a time went up to order.  It worked out well as you need to order before finding a seat anyway.

They have a larger menu and something for everyone including vegans, veggie eaters and carnivores.   They is falafel, chicken, ground beef, and you can t get it in a pita, on a plate, or a salad.  There is also a hummus plate, different sides like Falafel, Couscous Tabouli, Babaganush, Hummus, Chopped Salad, Majadra Rice, and hand cut fries.  There is also soup and they have a soup of the day and lentil.

For drinks there is soda, wine, beer, bottled drinks, tea, coffee and Turkish coffee complete with the little cooking pot and spout.  They also deliver and have lunch specials and if your company is having an event they have Food carts.

We ordered just about everything on the menu.  First it was drinks with teas, coffees, wine (we had the bottle), couple beers, sodas, and bottled drinks.  Then we started placing orders and most of our food came out together which was nice.  We all dug in.  The food was AMAZING so good!

The hand-cut fires were yummy!  I got the falafel salad with was DELISH!  Everyone LOVED there F-BOMBS, and other pita sands and well as the few plates we had on our table.  

GOOD FOOD, GREAT conversation and a good time was had!  It was great we all could fit in one room and just hang out with my mid-west, and SoCal Fam BAM to start the holi-dolies!  I will definitely come back here.  The employees were so accommodating and nice!  Being there was 12 of us we got a little loud at times and we stayed longer than the norm but they didn't mind at all."}
{"text":"Exceptional falafel at the food truck. Interesting and varied ingredients in the pita along with the falafel. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I live in Milwaukee and have been on an extensive search for a good falafel pita.  With no avail, I saw a take out menu for this place while visiting madison on my boyfriend's father's fridge.  Scanning through the menu, I knew I wanted to go the next day.  It was a great experience.  Good customer service, freshly made food.  I have never knowingly had authentic Israeli hummus.  My god. Exquisite.  Heavy on the tahini, plenty of oil and parsley, and great fresh pita bread for dipping.  The Banzo Pita was out of this world, everything I've ever wanted from a falafel pita. Can't say I have ever found anything that can rival this place.  I hope they do well, definitely going to be one of my favorite places to go while visiting Madison.  Hummus can be very addicting.  Overall great prices, great service, great dishes.    Big servings, so be ready for bringing some home."}
{"text":"Tried Banzo Falafel first time and it was good. I love Falafel sandwiches and glad that I tried Banzo. I had Falafel pitta sandwich. It was great. Going to try different varieties from Banzo soon:

Great work guys !!"}
{"text":"I got the Harvest Platter or plate, I can't remember! But the falafel was effing amaaaazing.
The hummus was on point,
The pitas were earm, delicious, and toasty.  The hot sauce was worth the extra 25 cents.
Their minimum delivery isn't insane. You don't haaave to order 2 person (s) worth of food.

They were around a half an hour faster than grub hub predicted so that was awesome :)
Holy yum."}
{"text":"They've got the best falafel I've ever eaten. They fly their pita in from Israel! Their hummus and tdaziki sauce is great. I should try other things but the F-Bomb plate (two falafels, 2 meat kabobs) is so Effing Fantastic that I just keep ordering it every f'ing time!"}
