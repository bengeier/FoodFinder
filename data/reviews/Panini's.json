{"text":"Oh boy. baaad bartender. My girlfriend comes through this place for a sandwich. 
Btw. Shes the sweetest little thing. Social, but extremely friendly and non confrontational. just an all around sweet and nice to everyone kind a girl. And quite beautiful, which makes her quite unique young lady!
While ordering from the bartender she asks for blue cheese on the side. The bartender takes her order, and its brought out to my girl. my girl tips the bartender %25 and is on her way, only to realize there's no blue cheese. classic setup for customer service test. What happens? 

This bartender sticks it to my lady hard! instead of just giving her the cheese she paid for already, she gives my girl a long 3 second look of womanly hatred and says \"that'l be .79 cents.\" 
now to all you restaurant goers, you see whats going on here. its not about the .79 cents. its personal. so my girl, sweet as she is, very kind inquires into the fact that she didnt get the blue cheese she already paid for. Two words come from the bartender. \"prove it\". 
So i gave this place ONE star, since i was talked out of calling the establishment and ripping A-holes all around.
There is no excuse for washed up alpha female wannabes to take out there 40 years of failure on my sweet girl. she was nothing but kind. So if youre in the airport, avoid this place. This bartender is an older, somewhat attractive lady with dark hair that she wore in a pony tail.
If you think you can get away with treating people like crap because youre an airport establishment, youre wrong. 
I invite the owners to contact me, certainly repetitions of this cant be good for your reviews or business."}
{"text":"Great choice for an airport stop.  Food was served fresh and hot, service really awesome, and - in terms of airport prices - reasonable."}
{"text":"I've actually cooked at this chain in what seems like a lifetime ago. Overpriced bar food (fried stuff, quesidillas, wings, etc.), cliche overdone atmosphere, cafeteria-like open atmosphere, and most notably- exceptionally abysmal service. 

I waited 10 minutes at a less than crowed bar for a drink. Bartender noticed me, explained how busy she was (pet peeve of mine) and assured me she's serve me on just a moment. Another 5 minutes pass and the bartender serves another customer. So I walk away and have my girlfriend get me a drink. 

After about 40 minutes I attempt to get another drink. 5 minutes pass and I finally get the bartenders attention. \"Be with you in a moment.\" Fine. Finally get my drink (bud light draft, really complicated) and ask to be closed out. Presented with my card and the receipt. No pen. I proceed to wait 10 minutes for a pen while she races around making drinks. Atrocious service. 

Nice patio though."}
{"text":"We only had drinks, but we observed quite a bit. I am amazed at any restaurant that can offer \"normal\" pricing in an airport. Panini's does that quite well. And portion size... extra kudos for that! The wine appears to be about an 8 ounce pour. We watched various food items being served, and were quite impressed by the general appearance, and the portion size."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch prior to a business flight to Los Angeles. I've had a lot of airport food and I must say this was the best airport burger I've ever had. The fries were typical panini fries which are nothing to write home about, but the burger was juicy and delicious. I would have no qualms in stopping in for lunch again on my next flight out of town."}
{"text":"They have a flight board in the restaurant which is great for traveling!  Food and people are great too. Best in the airport by far."}
{"text":"This place is where to be if you are flying through Cleveland. They do everything right. Good beer, good food (even though they have dropped the veggie burger from the menu), electrical outlets everywhere, considerate fast service...what's not to like?
 I wish LAX had a place like this!"}
{"text":"I was stuck in Solon, Ohio for a week of meetings, with only a KFC and a Longhorn Steakhouse nearby to keep me company. It was like my throat had been cut. On the way home, going through Cleveland Airport, I stumbled upon Panini's and ordered the overstuffed sandwich with turkey and a fried egg. When the waitress came by and asked how everything was, I deleriously replied, \"This is the best sandwich eveeeeer...\" (Homer style).

I would have scored Panini's a five but will need to try it again when I haven't been starved for a week."}
{"text":"Seeing as this is a restaurant at an airport, I thought I'd be emptying my wallet, but was surprised to see how well everything is priced! I got a classic entree with Chicken Tenders and fries - it also came with a delishious side of Coleslaw and man, was it great! Definitely going back whenever I have layovers in Cleveland! My server, Cynthia, was polite, friendly and professional, glad she could brighten my day!"}
{"text":"They don't act like they want my business. Walked out. Perhaps the rumors about the. Not being gay friendly have some merit."}
{"text":"Awful Place, just Awful.  From double charging our bill on our credit card (both different amounts) to putting other peoples sandwiches on my friends ck (and refusing to fix it, manager threatened to call the police) to changing the tip.  Watch your credit card or better yet, pay with CASH.  I refuse to eat here, drink here, or support this dump.

And the patio has got to be the most god-awful patio in Cleveland.  Just bad."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ pork sandwhich.  Pretzel bun was pretty greasy for my liking but tasty. Pork was tender. Sauce was very runny and low on the flavor profile.  Fries were served luke warm and clumped together :/  
Waitresses didn't make eye contact. They don't provide airport employee discounts.  
Blech!"}
{"text":"When in the Cleveland Airport there aren't many options for tasty food. Meanwhile, Paninis might be one of the better choices, as long as you aren't serious about finding something healthy. They don't do healthy here. This is traditional Great Lakes flare, namely lots of calories and no regard for healthy choices. If this is you're thing - this is your spot. 

Paninis greatest attribute comes with value and friendly service. You can eat a hand padded, quality burger with fries here for $7. This location is in the United section of the airport and fixed with flatscreens to watch TV while waiting for your flight. It also comes with great service. The waitresses here are very good, particularly for an airport location. 

As for what to order? Take your pick, but the burgers, wraps and paninis are the staples, but the wings aren't bad either. Just remember to not count your calories and you'll be thrilled."}
{"text":"Went in with a large group (in town for a soccer tournament).  Three of us had to sit at a separate table. 

We waited a bit for everything, but that was expected since there so many of us. The menu was fairly extensive...a lot of variations on the same thing (burgers, sandwiches, wraps, panini).

My daughter ordered the Lake Perch and received basic Fish and Chips that tasted like Chicken Tenders. I had the French Dip which was good but soggy (even before using the au jus).  My friend had one of the wraps and it was so greasy she couldn't eat it. Another friend enjoyed the Chicken Tortilla soup. Her daughter ordered guacamole with her chips and salsa for an additional $1.99 only to get a cup the size of her thumb. They sent it back. No one cared for the fries. 

Overall, it was OK but I'll likely not go back."}
{"text":"We had the corned beef and pastrami overstuffed sandwiches. It was very good  and reasonable price.   Our waitress was excellent and will come back."}
{"text":"Had the most spicy wings.  They smell funny.  Will Smith the manager came out to assure us the wings were fine and the smell was fine.  He is very personable and really desires everything to be excellent.  Yes that really is the managers name."}
{"text":"After a horrible experience at The Pub, we came to Panini's to redeem our breakfast experience. We fly out of Cleveland quite a bit, and have had ok experiences in the past of other restaurants in the airport (The Pub being the worst).  Amy was our server/bartender and was awesome, friendly, and the food was great (breakfast buffet). Will def come back here when we fly next."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get a quick meal.. Well.. We had an hour layover.. And got the wings.. Not the best but they were ok.  But the pizza was awesome.. Especially for an airport."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Sat at the bar during my layover the only thing on the menu was the pizza beer is expensive but I would have guess that since we were at the airport.
The pizza was pretty decent"}
{"text":"Waiting for our flight.  Again, why is it that \"usually\" airport establishments generally provide worse customer service?  I asked the bartender if they had anything from Great Lakes Brewing and she waved her hand back saying \"only in a bottle\". I look and all I see are bottles of various booze and beer bottles and ask \"what kind\" as I can't differentiate everything and she looks at me like I'm blind. Airports must be good locations for people without customer service skills to find employment!  On the bright side the cup of Chicken Tortilla Soup my wife ordered and the Cheesy Bacon Fries I ordered were very good!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, and sides, the Pizzas are always a pleasant surprise.
Service is a little slow, recently changed ownership and is better for it."}
{"text":"As far as I know, there is nothing wrong with this place.  They do everything that a bar and grill should do: provide good comfort food cooked well, lots of TVs around for sports or whatnot (hell, a lot of the booths have a TV in them), serve cold beer, have a couple of video games, have clean bathrooms, cute servers with good attitudes.  Panini's does this exceptionally well, and is family-friendly to boot.  The kids' pizza is delicious and more than kid sized, so dads can make sure that they are ok to eat several times :).  Plus, Kamm's Corners is a great location, full of decent, hardworking, down to earth people with little to no chip on their shoulders (nudge nudge, Lakewood ;-))

I get the feeling that a lot of people crap on a place like Panini's out of a sense of what they want others to think of them.  It's like if you get stopped on the street and asked your opinion, and you don't want anyone to think you're dumb, so you say what you think other people want to hear you say.  A lot of reviews here on Yelp have a lot of grief in them about craft beers, local beers, etc.  Don't pan Panini's (LOL!, alliterative puns!) just because they don't brew their own beer.  Also, don't look down your nose at a beer just because it happens to be mass produced.  There is a reason why it's mass produced, and being popular doesn't necessarily mean that something is bad.  @Rob S.  I give you permission to be OK with the fact that you like Budweiser!!! :)"}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food.  I only ordered the chicken wings, but I liked them.  Service was great.  Everyone was so friendly!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this airport bar. 

I'll start with the service, and I want to call out Ronnie the bartender. He was so incredibly friendly and attentive. It was a pleasure having him wait on me.
 
I was also impressed with the food- fresh, never frozen chicken is very much appreciated from an airport bar, and the thick 9-grain bread was a nice touch as well. The fresh cut French fries were a nice surprise, too!  

The only other thing I experienced was a yuengling light on tap, which I was super excited about."}
{"text":"By far the worst in the airport.  I am a flight attendant and eat many meals in airports.  I ordered a simple BLT.  How can you screw up a BLT?!?!  I received a half ass attempt at someone smearing mayo on one side of the toast.  I may have got approx. 1 teaspoon.  Some of the bacon was crisp and the other half was par cooked.   The fries were soggy.  The restaurant was not busy and yet I waited about 15minutes for my to-go sandwich.  Don't waste your money.  
By the way, my flying partners corn beef sandwich was terrible as well."}
{"text":"We finally found a place to eat and the food was great. The fresh cut fries were great and the BLT was also. More importantly Tami was a delight! She was all smiles and seated us promptly and was just a friendly, courteous server.  This was the third place we went to try to get a bite to eat before leaving on vacation. The other places told us they were closing and one place the servers were just rude so we left. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Grabbing a quick bite to eat in Terminal C of the Cleveland airport. Panini's is very good!  Taking into account that is in an airport, it's excellent!  We tried the Ragin' Cajun chicken sandwich. It's marinated chicken with a slight kick on thick sour dough bread with green peppers and onions. We also got the club sandwich. It's also good--ham, turkey, and cheese. For sides, we had chips for one sandwich and a side salad for the other. Both were great!  Panini's is definitely a place to try if you're near or at the Cleveland airport!"}
{"text":"What an excellent airport find!  They have a bit of everything and whereas the sandwiches looked amazing, the pizza really caught my eye.  It was an amazing photo of pizza and the actual pizza came out looking just as the picture.  Thicker crust and completely fresh, made to order.  We had been waiting awhile, and with a flight to catch, we inquired about our pizza.  There was some sort of printer malfunction and it wasn't really put in but they totally made up for it.  They made it immediately from there and and even comped the pizza after apologizing.  We had time left so it was good.  They have a good selection of beer, local and not and the service was amazing!"}
{"text":"I had the delicious panini sandwich with corned beef slaw french fries and fresh tomato.  It was a really good sandwich but didn't leave me overfilled and groggy. 

My lunchmate rated his sandwich 3 stars because he said the fries that were on his sandwich were soggy and he said the bread was a bit overpowering. It was pretty good value. 
I'd go back because the menu had a lot of other interesting items."}
{"text":"Great Bar & Grill! Food is on the high end of good for bar food. Waitresses are friendly, service is quick unless there is a Browns Game on then service is a little slower."}
{"text":"They've got Jack Daniels. And ice. And TVs. Which all come in handy after checking in with that shittiest of shitty airlines, United (most recent data here: http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-and-worst-airlines-airports-and-flights-summer-2015-update/?ex_cid=538fb) and being practically strip searched by the nearby TSA personnel. Under $13 for a double--not bad, as airport prices go."}
{"text":"While this may knock me down a few notches on the snob ladder, I would have to say that, if I took an honest look at myself and my drinking habits, my most purchased beer is Budweiser. Yes, Budweiser, my copper standard of beer. Nothing fancy, good to drink when playing guitar, gets the job done. And that's how I feel about Panini's (minus the guitar). Not the most amazing food or atmosphere, but if you're hungry and want a sandwich (or burger) and beer, this place will not let you down. I myself had a Reuben here that was damn near perfect. And there were some old dudes in the bar area that were already into their third or fourth beer at 11 in the morning on a Saturday. That is some Kamm's Corners shit right there."}
{"text":"I had no expectations coming here for the first time. Most Airport food is fair to bad!

I sat at the bar and was approached by Daisy - who was very friendly and fun to talk with. I ordered the Spinach salad with grilled chicken.

The salad came out in about 10 minutes - with lots of fresh spinach, a sliced freshly grilled chicken breast - tender and cooked just right! The salad included sliced hardboiled egg, tomatoes, avocado, onions, and I think bacon.  I opted for their spicy Chipotle Ranch dressing - which was a perfect dressing for the salad. The salad has to be the best salad I've ever eaten in an Airport - by far!

Daisy made sitting at the bar fun and interesting, she came by to check on me several times and struck up a conversation in between serving customers.

I noticed that a LOT of airline pilots were stopping by to place \"to-go\" orders to take on the plane with them. Which says something to me about the quality of the food!

They have a full bar here - mixed drink offerings, wines and Ales and beers.

I'll definitely come back here again - there were some other interesting and delicious looking menu items!"}
{"text":"Not that bad as far as Paninis go.  I remember when there was one back in the day on the west and east bank of the Flatts.  Where all the meatheads went after the clubs to chow down.  This one is a tyical West Park bar...cheap beers, OK food.  This one doesnt have the fake shamrocks on the wall which is a breath of fresh air..    They always have great online deals ($10.00 for $20.00) which is awesome.  You can also use the gift certs for BEER!  Always a plus.  They have little TVs on the walls that show cartoons...my daughter digs it!  Service is pretty good...sometimes all the servers are standing around talking and ya have to physically go get one.  So look for an online deal and this place is well worth it for a simple meal...full price...not so much..  And I hope people in Cleveland know that Panninis ripped off Primanti Bros in Pittsburgh, right?!"}
{"text":"CHOICES 

When traveling and stuck at an airport you are left with choices. At some point you must decide between the lesser of two evils. 

This place seemed easy for us because it had a kids menu and a beer special. We decided we were going to hold out for Rick Bayless in Chicago but the little one needed food. 

Charmain our waitress was very nice and full of positive energy. She seemed to love her job and that translates well to being a customer. We ordered a kids meal with 2 Chicken Tenders and mandarin oranges. The little one really liked it. She was not happy with the overly sweet BBQ sauce. She is turning into such a foodie. The chicken fingers were not out of this world but it sure filled up a hungry belly. We opted for the fruit over deep fried fries. 
 
We dived in on the $5.50 everyday special of  16oz cans of Bud Light. No airport has beer prices that low, so we were happy to enjoy a little adult beverages prior to flying. 

The space is very comfy. There are a lot of TVs around in case you want to enjoy the big game or SportsCenter. There is also a $4 shot special which you can add on to any beer purchase. I did not enjoy this special but the slurring guy next to us was thoroughly having a great time. I am not sure who carried him to his flight and there's a good possibility he is probably still stuck in the booth. 

This place even has an All You Can Eat breakfast buffet before 9am. I only read about this and did not eat it. I just have never seen an AYCE inside of an airport. On a side note I'm not sure I could recommend that prior to taking off in an airplane. Hopefully you don't meet any turbulence along the way or everyone on the plane will be seeing your breakfast. 

So if you find yourself stuck in the Cleveland Airport then I recommend you choose this bar. It's a great place to have a few drinks and a light snack prior to taking off."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews...I decided to try the wings and the pizza.    Both were very good....I had the cajun wings and they were nicely fried and seasoned...not too spicy, meaty and well done....celery and ranch sauce would be extra.....  

I ordered the pizza with chicken and banana peppers....again, very nicely done, crispy edges, thin grilled pizza, nice toppings...overall a good choice in CLE.

I would come back..."}
{"text":"This spot definitely did the trick during our 13 hour delay. United provided us with the ever generous $7 meal voucher and Great Lakes was completely full so we came here.

The restaurant was packed, but our waitress was holding it down. She quickly greeted us and took our orders when we were ready. At the end of the meal she cashed us out efficiently as well.

We shared Fried Pickles and a Quesadilla. The fried pickles were everything I was dreaming a fried pickle could be. I gobbled these up. The quesadilla was also good and satisfied my husband's need for Mexican food. We weren't overly hungry when we arrived, but the menu had several great options that I'd try if I came here again."}
{"text":"So, I wasn't really expecting much from this place. I was stuck in an airport and all too often, everything is overpriced and not all that great. I was looking for a good place to eat and someone asked me if I needed help. I explained what I was looking for and they recommended this place. I went and checked out their menu; to my surprise, there was a lot to offer and the prices were actually very reasonable. I ended up getting the breakfast burger. It had a fried egg, bacon, ham, and cheese all with a beef burger. They offered a variety of bun choices too. So yeah, I was already happy with the options and the prices, but even more happy when they brought out the food. Not only were there tons of fries, but they were good. The best part, however, was the burger. Honestly, it's probably in my top five burgers that I've ever eaten. And for all that food and only being around $11, that's pretty amazing. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"If you want an out of the park sandwich this is the place to go, they also have good pizza. Its a great place to watch the games as well. Food prices are decent. The beer choices kind of suck.....mostly the trendy widely available beers, not much hand craft/imports/belgians. But if you like budweiser/pabst/miller etc....then you're in. Just make sure you sit in the dining area if you don't wanna be bothered by drunk assholes cause there's always alot near the bar."}
{"text":"Delayed, or cancelled United flight? Try Panini's! 

I was not really expecting much from a diner/ bar type in an airport, but Panini's did not disappoint.

First night I was stuck in Cleveland, I've had a bowl of chili and some wings. The chili was warm, and tasted really good, served with cheese, jalapeños and crackers. Shortly after they served my chili, I got my salt and pepper wings served with celery sticks and blue cheese dip. It had the perfect elements of good chicken wings: hot, crispy, flavorful and greasy! :) 

Next morning, flight was delayed again. I tried a reuben sandwich. The portion was huge, and the proportion of protein to bread was satisfying. 

Overall, when you're flights are delayed or cancelled, Panini's is definitely your go to. :)"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a work outting and an employee recommended Panini's.  I couldn't fit it into my busy trip schedule so I stopped by this location in the airport.  I started with a Zing Zang Bloody Mary - which was great before a flight.  For my entree, I had the Tuna Melt.  I love me some Tuna Melts and this one was one of the best I've had.  I had the chips on the side, however, my travel mate tried the onion rings which were to die for.  This is definitely a great lunch, dinner, or drinking spot in the CLE airport!"}
{"text":"Very little expectation on airport restaurants, but it turns out surprisingly good.  Their pizza is nicely done and wings are saucy.  The salad is a bit of disappointment.  Nonetheless,  a good experience overall especially the waitress was so attentive."}
{"text":"The true and original sandwich stuffed with French fries is at Primanti Brothers' in Pittsburgh. However, their rival city Cleveland does a solid imitation. Cole slaw needs a little more vinegar IMO, but the cheese is sharp, fries are crisp, and bread is good soft Italian. I could almost believe I'm back in grad school. They've got other bar food too, but the sandwich is really the attraction here. 

One star off for beer price gouging. $10 for 16oz of a local brew is nutsoid. Other than that, solid choice in a nice little airport."}
{"text":"Good food, HUGE portions, with a side of cardiac arrest!

Came here during a layover...saw the good reviews, so figured we would give it a shot.

I went with the Overstuffed Sandwich with Pastrami and Fried Egg ($8.99). Great sandwich just super fattening lol. Portions were big as well!  Interesting to eat it with the fries on the sandwich already, but it works so I am not complaining :)

Also tried the Overstuffed Sandwich with Roast Beef and Capicola ($8.99). Good! A little spice in there too...again, huge portions.  I ate the other half of the sandwich for lunch the next day.

Also had the Cheesy Bacon Fries ($7.99): Hand-cut Fries, Melted Cheddar & Mozzarella, and Applewood Bacon. Yes, they were good...yes they were oily, fatty, and just plain ole BAD for you!  I haven't eaten guilt food like this for a little while...just felt sorry for myself while eating this LOL.

The server was friendly, and she never rushed us since we were here for a couple hours during a layover.  We were able to charge our phones too while eating, and had a couple drinks after our meal to pass the time.

I'd recommend it :)

Pics :"}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing the house-fried potato chips. Salty and golden brown and delicious.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I was walking down to Great Lakes but decided to stop here and save the walk.  Overstuffed sandwich was good with lots of fries on the sandwich.  But the main reason for the review was the service.  DeAnne was great; someone who seemed like a really nice person who actually loved her job.  Worth a stop."}
{"text":"I am from Rochester New York and came to ohio for roverfest. On the way back home we stopped at paninis and loved it! Food was all great and fair priced. Will definitely come back again next time I am in Ohio!"}
{"text":"Small place, very friendly help. Fast service.
I didn't try their famous spin on the primanti sandwich but it sure did look good. 

Stella on tap served in proper glasses with both a large and small option.

Hectic, but clean. The best part? 10' from my departing gate!"}
{"text":"I greatly anticipated my overstuffed sandwich from Panini's and it certainly did not disappoint!  It's basically all of my favorite things shoved between two incredibly soft slices of bread: Pastrami, produce and FRIES!

This is really gross and I probably shouldn't admit it but I ate half of my sandwich, wrapped up the other half, traveled for 7 hours, and then finished it.  I lived to tell the tale!"}
{"text":"It is hard to imagine but I went with the pizza. I will say that they had a wide variety of choices all the way from the starters to entrees. I got the original crust versus the thin crust, however I found out the original crust is pretty thin itself. The must be cracker crust. There wasn't full cheese coverage and the pizza was a little heavy on the sauce but not excessive. The sauce was also a little sweet so I had to add crushed red pepper to tang it up! At least they had Dr Pepper unlike most of the restaurants in New Jersey. I will say for an airport restaurant the pizza was reasonably priced - $8.99 for a 10\". It was a nice atmosphere with multiple televisions, music, and plenty of seating. The servers were nice and attentive but it was a little slow when I was there. I dropped the overall rating from a 4 to a 3 due to the pizza quality."}
{"text":"*** Food
* Service
* Location

I can't say enough about this place. I fly United (what used to be Continental) all the time because I live in Los Angeles and I am from Cleveland. United has the only non-stop flight to and from LA. It just so happens there is a PANINI'S in the United terminal concourse!!!!!

Italian style sandwiches stuffed with coleslaw and french fries. Where can you go wrong? These tasty treats come in many varieties, and sure they have other food- but WHY would you just not get the capicola? Wings are good if you'd prefer that- but TRUST me you need to get these sandwiches. 

I usually eat half there, and then half for dinner when I get home to LA. Yeah I bring it on the place. Yeah it's usually my only carry on.

If it's less than 4 stars, check the review- it MUST have been on another food item. I can't vouch for any breakfast or buffets or anything other than wings and sandwiches.

You've got to go with the sandwiches.

You just gotta.

Oh- and there's tables, bar seating, tv's and all that sort of thing.

Do: Capicola Sandwich, Italian Sandwich, Bloody Mary"}
{"text":"Well, let's see. They offer a breakfast buffet, which is way over-priced, and is no better than an continental breakfast you would see at a Quality Inn. I was waiting for my flight, so I had to hang out here. The only saving grace is the excellent service. God bless those waitresses, they are so nice.

Otherwise, overpriced, tasteless food. They're lucky they're in an airport. Otherwise they'd go out of business."}
{"text":"Great service! And a substantial amount of seating all inside the \"blah\" of Hopkins International.  The service at this airport is the direct foil of the service of Panini's.  Our waitress was friendly, accommodating and very quick.

I ordered the Outlaw Burger w/ some fries... I had a diet coke to go w/ the meal and it was quickly replenished as I threw them down.

The burger was juicy! Flavorful and made perfectly to medium.  The BBQ Sauce was an awesome surprise--sweet and light, which meant it didn't run down my arms as I took each bite.  This was a STRONG burger and the fries went perfect w/ them.  We had a group of 5 and she made sure we all got what we needed while juggling a packed house.

I enjoyed my time here at Panini's and it was a great location to catch the remainder of the MLB Opening Day Games (The Tribe was on so it was a good time for the locals).

I have been to the Panini's inside of town before and I had a great time then w/ the wings... the experience continued to be great at this location and I will be sure to stop by again the next time I'm in town.

P.S. my coworker got a pizza and it was a thin crust pizza w/ jalapenos, pepperoni and mushrooms... I had a bite of it and it was delightful!!! Just in case you're not in the mood for a burger, y'know? ;)"}
{"text":"When your Mom tells you, you have to eat at the place with the HUGE grilled reuben during your stop over in Cleveland for the best sandwich and onions rings you have ever had, you listen. Here is what we got: 

The Works Pizza - I'm not sure of the exact name on the menu but this is what my husband got. We both thought is was an above average tasting pizza. The sauce, the cheese, the crust were all above average. 

Patty Melt - It was your typical patty melt which is not a bad thing. I have no complaints. The onions rings I ordered for an extra $1.50 were above average like the pizza. The breading was slightly sweet. I wish they gave me more than 6 small rings, though it was plenty. I would have liked to have over indulged on them :) 

Overall this place was clean and the service was great. They have and expansive menu and I would surely try them again when passing through Cleveland."}
