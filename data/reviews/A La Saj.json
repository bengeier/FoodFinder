{"text":"Two words: STAY AWAY.  À la Saj is welcoming and modern, all white and trendy with nice little touches like old pictures of Syria on the walls and a chalk map of Damascus on the ceiling. Very nice, well done.  It sits in a prime location in a small area right next to Concordia university and above two great veggie/vegan restaus. The place was practically empty which may have been a sign for us to reconsider seeing as our first choice downstairs, the very good \"Panthère Vert,\" had a lineup extending to the outside at lunchtime during the first week of the Fall semester.  We ordered the \"mezze\" platter which consisted of \"traditional\" Arab staples like green olives, labneh (soft cheese), grilled white cheese, foul, and za'atar w zeit (thyme with sesame and olive oil). We also had some falafel and homous.  Things were bad from the get-go: the waitress needed several explanations to understand our order (all we did was ask to add some falafel and homous to the mezze platter...), only to repeat ourselves to her supervisor when he showed at our table unsure of our order a few minutes later.  When the food arrived, we noticed the portions were somewhat underwhelming, looking more like samples. The waitress had also somehow forgotten the \"saj\" bread (she seemed surprised for some reason?!) so we had to wait until that was made at a side bar before we could dig in.  The bread having arrived, we noticed the foul had also been missing. In retrospect, we would have been better off without reminding the supervisor that the traditional fava bean dish was indeed included in the mezze platter.. He took some convincing but he couldn't argue with his own menu (rolls eyes, shakes head, palms face).  Digging into the food while waiting, we started with the houmos which was nice and lemony though too light and creamy - not bad - it would turn out to be the only edible thing we would be served.  The bread was freshly grilled, yes, but too chewy, not warm enough and not so tasty - certainly not worth the stink of oil clogging up the air circulation in the place and inevitable stench of oil sticking to your clothing.   Listen, if you are going to name your place \"à la saj\" and call it your \"specialty,\" you better get it right. Also, get a better ventilation system if you're going to grill bread on site!  The falafels were unusually tiny, oily with saturation on the side like they had been sitting there for a while (former Lebanese restaurant owner here), undercooked on the inside, not crunchy and lacking flavor. They clearly didn't have the right mix of ingredients or frying techniques down.   The za'atar was more like a cup of oil with some sesame seeds floating in and had a  strange ingredient or two in it that tasted maybe like grenadine and/or lemon - it just didn't taste right. Even the green olives were sliced and couldn't have been more mediocre tasting, like they were cooked up in a laboratory or recently unearthed from a subterranean cold war-era shelter... The labneh had no flavor whatsoever (hint: don't use yogurt with added cream in the ingredients; do add some salt and maybe olive oil and dried mint before serving). The grilled cheese was under-grilled and not so fresh and possibly the wrong choice of white cheese..  So the foul arrives and it looks like a total nightmare. Instead of whole, or alternatively, mushed fava beans and chick peas, we get a tiny pot comprised mostly of bean skins sitting in a liquidy mess of water and oil. It was also off-color (seriously) and didn't smell all that appetizing frankly. So we break off some bread, scoop up a bit, give it a taste and hope for the best. Let me tell you something, we each had one bite and never touched it again. It not only tasted NOTHING like foul, in fact we kept saying it was not so much foul as it was \"foul\" (pronounced fowl), but it seemed like the \"chef\" was either experimenting, had no clue what they were doing  or maybe accidentally spilled other things into it. There were several \"flavors\" at once and they were all awful. There were no chick peas, no lemon, no salt, no garlic, no cumin - what the hell did they put in it?? Who knows.. Honestly, it tasted suspiciously rancid..    In conclusion:  This new place will be out of business very soon and it should be. You can't get away with something like this in Montreal. If you can't make certain foods reasonably well you shouldn't serve them, PERIOD.   Now, I don't know if their \"untraditional\" sandwiches are better or maybe \"less bad,\" but I would be highly skeptical and I certainly am not going to try and find out.  How do you open a restaurant with all the investment of time and money that goes into it and provide such total garbage food? Are you kidding me? I swear if we hadn't been in such a hurry, I would have sat the owner down for a talk then demanded a refund of our $20 - seriously -  it was that god-awful!  STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Grabbed a chicken shawarma to go. The chicken was very dry and not much flavour, bread fell apart instantly and the tahini sauce wasn't even on the shawarma, had to scoop it up and put it on the sandwich.   I'll leave this place to the tourists walking down Stephen Ave because it's a bit on the pricey side (nearly $15 for one medium-sized shawarma)... at least it has late hours and fast service."}
{"text":"Lovely Syrian restaurant with an array of great sandwiches & salads. I've had the chicken shawarma and a salad called the fatet saj with their own flatbread, tahini, chickpeas, pomegranate seeds & pine nuts, and both were delicious and quite distinct from other Middle Eastern food I've had.   I'm often looking for a quick & inexpensive lunch or dinner downtown and this is nice place for takeout or to sit in. The staff is very friendly and obviously passionate about what they do!"}
{"text":"Now 'Kayf'. Food was average, but Absolutely the worst service I have ever seen! At no point should a server be yelling at a customer, especially when it's just a few guys wanting to grab a quick bite before going home; also the owner was there and ignored the situation.   A couple of friends and I decided to grab a quick bite, after being out for a buddy's birthday. My friend asked for a glass of water with his food, waitress says they don't serve glasses of water, walks away. Surprised, my friend asked her 'why' when she came around again, she ignores him. A second waitress came by, my friend asked her very politely 'why they did not serve glasses of water', she walked away without a sound. Stormed back a minute later yelling at my friend, called him an Asshole, slammed a bottle of water down then walked away.  Shocked, my friend didn't know how to react. Then 5 mins later, the first waitress came back, grabbed the bottle of water the other waitress slammed own, and walked away with it.  We waved the owner over, wanting to resolve any misunderstanding, he said his waitress did not call him an Asshole, in fact he only heard her saying 'IF you are going to be an Asshole', because apparently, if you put 'if' in front of an insult, it's not an insult!  So IF Kayf has such terrible service, how come there are others with similar reviews about their bad service? Your service is Horrific, and the food is only average compared to the many sherwarma/Donair shops in the area."}
{"text":"Went there 2 times ..their saj pitas are amazing whether it is the german or traditional cheese and zataar ..not to forget the Kinder chocolate and mozzarella .Another must try is their Fatah a la saj (chickpeas with yogurt ,tahini and the crunchy goodness of saj crumbs ).2 thumbs up .. Seems the previous review had an agenda or something ;)"}
{"text":"The food is below par. Portions are extremely small. The chicken is tasteless and the bread was stale. Skip this place and head to BBQ"}
{"text":"Lovely food! Have been here around 4 times with coworkers and we have all been thrilled with the food, but the service needs a little work.   From forgetting items we ordered or leaving us with a long wait for the bill (which wouldn't normally be an issue, but rushing to get back to work isn't ideal) the service just seems a little scattered.   It's a shame because the food is amazing! Hopefully the service will improve."}
{"text":"So delicious! I agree with the other reviewers, this place is fast, fresh and so tasty. It does seem like the kind of place Calgary needs to keep around, there is something so fresh and modern about this place, just a gem.  We were going to a concert at the Jack Singer and decided to stop in and give this place a try before the show. We were looking for something fresh and relatively fast and this place was a great choice.   We had one chicken shawarma and one  beef donair, each with a side salad. The food came out almost instantly and everything was delicious. This place does it a little different, and that is exactly what makes this place great. For example, the donair was just the meat and sauce in the wrap, with pickles on the side. I have to say, I really liked it this way. And I agree with others, the portion sizes of the sandwiches are spot on.  They also have shisha, and quite a few people were enjoying that on the Saturday evening. I also saw they have delivery through a delivery service, we are keeping it on the list for the next time I need a donair fix.  I can see why everyone raves about it as a lunch place, if I worked downtown I would love knowing I had this place in my pocket for a fresh and fast lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great representation of the shawarma on the Saj!   Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a falafel sandwich to go during my lunch break. When I got back to work and unwrapped my sandwich I was disappointed to see that there were no falafels in  my sandwich, instead there was a mushy saucy consistency with sautéed veggies. This is not what falafel is. They are supposed to be chick pea balls. I tried it anyway, and it was disgusting. I will not be back. Waste of my money"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves Syrian food and it sure is tasty. The restaurant is new and clean and the food is fast and fresh. I had the chicken fatoosh salad and it was delicious with a creamy dressing and topped with fried pita chips. So good!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Nice Little Restaurant ,serves great shawarma and makes the bread fresh, on the saj...meaning a metal griddle. It's freshness is what makes the wraps amazing, as well as other speciality items made with the bread, a must try is a Nutella and Rice Crispies wrap, or a traditional Zaatar which has an explosive taste of a mixture of lebenses spices. They also serve shisha, great flavours and in the nice big Khalil Mahmoon Pipes, a quality pipe from the Middle East. Teas and drinks are good, all I suggest is to call in for a reservation when going on a weekend. It can fill up fast."}
{"text":"Shawerma is super tasty, staff is super friendly. The bread they use is called \"saj\" which is thin and different than what you would get in other shawerma places."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the decent rating of this place compared to my experience when I went there tonight. They were out of beef donair when we arrived. The chicken shwarma we ordered was more like a wrap than a shwarma and definitely overpriced. The sheesha was sort of stale and in the bottom 3 sheesha I've had of all time. Bottled water only? At a late night place? Common.   I'm more likely to cab to a further away donair shop than I am to walk across the street to revisit this one in the future."}
{"text":"Great Shisha & yummy food! Love the service, I actually get my Shisha quick here unlike other Shisha restaurants.... Love love love the location!!!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Montreal, hands down. The uno sandwich is one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had without leaving me feeling stuffed. Danika, the waitress, was more than helpful making suggestions for tourists like myself from New York. Would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous review for this place in that the portions are massively underwhelming. Whatever I ordered ended up being the equivalent of a tortilla rolled up with melted cheese and some olives. Definitely not lunch-sized, nor worth paying for.  I suppose they don't get enough business to have the service thing down- while I was just ordering a \"sandwich\" to-go, the waitress seemed to think she needed to follow me around the restaurant while I wait.  I really wanted to give the place a try, really. I figured it looked too cute to be a total bust. I should have known by the empty restaurant."}
