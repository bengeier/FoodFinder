{"text":"A great place to watch the game but if they are busy (Sundays during football season) you have to get there extremely early to find a seat, otherwise forget about it."}
{"text":"This place continues to decline...we have been increasingly disappointed each time and last night was the final nail in the coffin.  We called ahead to see if the game we wanted to watch was on there. First the person on the phone said, \"I think we get that channel...\" \"Can you check?\" \"Yes, that game is on, I am watching it right now.\" We were there within 15 minutes,  but it wasn't on.  We were seated and 4 of the 9 tvs in our section were all showing the Ohio State -Wisconsin game which no one was watching.  I asked if one screen (any of the 4) could be switched since none of the tables were watching,  they said no.    Our poor server had a party of 18 in addition to ours and other tables (i was in the restaurant industry for years, you don't do this), so we rarely saw him. When he first came to the table we said we weren't going to order right away,  he said, \"And what will you have? \" Apparently waiting to order wasn't an option.     The two at the host stand were repeatedly asked how long the wait was and repeated the same answer each time,\"There's no way of knowing because the ASU game is on.\" The biggest issue with that was that it was only on one screen in our half of the dining room,  so it wasn't impacting table turns much, but most guests just left upon being told this. Another group who came in when we did had tried to call ahead for seating and we're told they don't do that. They were quite upset to see several tables pulled together for a different large group coming in...apparently that rule doesn't apply to everyone.     The food was okay, but just okay. Average food and terrible service maybe used to fly in Gilbert, but new competition is springing up every day. We will be taking our business there and giving them a shot, because we will never return here."}
{"text":"5/2/12 Thought it was time to update my review from a year or so ago so here goes.  We still go to Blue 32 several times a week and have been coming here literally since the day it opened because we get consistently great food and great service.    Great food, great service and prices similar to others!  The servers here are wonderful and always take care of you. Lots of big screen TV's so you can watch your favorite games and food that is definitely not \"bar\" food.  The food ranges from sandwiches, burgers, chicken, steaks, fish, potato soup (best anywhere) BBQ ribs (also the best anywhere), fish tacos, etc etc etc. Don't forget the best Philly in town! Oh, and great salads too!  Did I mention that the food is great?  Lots of selections for your beverage of choice and a good Happy Hour which ends at 7.  I believe reservations are accepted but don't quote me on that.  They have now opened another B32 in Scottsdale which I finally had the opportunity to check out. It is larger overall with a much larger patio and has a very similar decor but not quite as \"friendly\" look from the outside. It has the same great menu and similarly friendly staff.   On Fridays and game days there will be a wait but it's worth it.  :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a cold beer and watch a game. The food is very good the 3 times I have been there and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"The BEST!! I can't even count the number of times I have been here, and it's incredible every time! My husband was here for their opening and we have been hooked ever since. I am the type of person who always orders the same thing at restaurants.  Blue 32 is the only exception!! We have tried almost everything on the menu and have NEVER been disappointed!! If you don't try Blue 32, you are obviously crazy!!!"}
{"text":"Really?  The only Pinot Grigio available is Santa Margarita @ $12/glass!  I'm not a beer drinker and since this is a sports bar, I expected a quaffable white wine at a reasonable price. PLUS the waitress didn't tell us about the limited selection and high price.  To me this is an easy fix if they want to attract more women."}
{"text":"We met some friends here for lunch. The place was busy but we were seated quickly.  Our server Samantha was prompt with drink and food orders. She was very attentive to our needs even though her area was very busy...Thanks Samantha for the AWESOME service my friends and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This a a very good option for sports bar food and drinks. Tons of TVs and a huge alcohol selection. The Mahi tacos are my favorites! Always go here to watch asu football games. Good atmosphere"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a few times, as there are not many other choices out this way, and I always prefer to support local businesses over national chains. And each time we say to each other that we will not be back. Of all of the different items that I have tried, I have never gotten anything that was actually good. On our last visit, my son ordered a pasta dish that had no flavor, I ordered the monte cristo and it was horrible, my daughter ordered a burger and it was like a hockey puck. Our server was nice, once she warmed up a bit. From now on, we will venture further north when we dine out instead of trying to stay in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great service. Food is really good, had a flat bread BBQ pizza, wow. I will be back"}
{"text":"Great sports bar atmosphere, with an even better menu. The best chicken bacon avocado sandwich ever is here!  The grilled chicken alone (which is an option as a healthy entree) is marinated in a pineapple concoction, and makes it flavorful and fantastic!  The bacon is thick, Applewood smoked, and the sandwich comes with a generous portion of steak-cut, seasoned fries.  They also have a nice selection of local beers on tap - always nice to see Four Peaks' HopKnot IPA on draft!"}
{"text":"I love how every category of the menu has some form of buffalo chicken.  Buffalo chicken wings appetizer, buffalo chicken salad, buffalo chicken sandwich, buffalo chicken wrap...  Of course, there are lots of other salads, sandwiches, wraps, and dishes on the menu, but they had me at buffalo chicken.  I got the wrap and thought the buffalo sauce added a nice bit of flavor, but wasn't too hot.  The blue cheese in the wrap is delicious, but does take over a bit, so I'd only recommend this if you are a big blue cheese fan.  I got the wrap with steak fries which were nicely seasoned (i.e. salty, but not too salty).  The service was great and the restaurant in general felt very clean and kept up. The bathroom was seemingly luxurious for this sports bar type of atmosphere.  There are 3 stalls in the ladies room with real walls and doors separating them.  Nice baby changing station in the stall by the sink."}
{"text":"Very well put together sports bar with plenty of new flat panel HD tv's. There is a lot of good seating, and a nice bar. Your typical sports bar, but a little more upscale.   There is a nice selection of varied food on the menu, from Rib-eye to wings to a nice selection of salad. An appetiser I would like to try is the buffalo shrimp as their wing sauce has a nice flavor, do not be scared of their hot sauce though, it's not hot. The wife had a Monte Cristo which was great.   The beer selection is decent, with the domestic staples on draft and Shiner Bock, Blue Moon, Kiltlifter, Fat Tire, Guiness and perhaps another.   The server, although very pretty was slooow, and the beer came even slower. My final pint came a few minutes after we finished eating and were ready to go, even though i ordered it just after my food came... I do eat somewhat fast, but come on!!!! Apparently although being a sports bar, they have not figured out how to keep the beer flowing.   I will go there again for the food and the facility but more slow service would keep me from going back a third time..."}
{"text":"Over the years we have visited several of the Blue 32 locations; it's a great well known local chain. The service is ALWAYS very good! The food is always good! Some of our favorite include: the Shrimp & Applewood Bacon Quesadilla, Spinach Artichoke Dip, Rib appetizer or entr√©e, Buffalo Chicken Salad, Chicken & Avocado Club, all the burgers (my husband loves them), Grilled Shrimp (my favorite) and BE SURE TO GET THE FRESH BAKED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES (ADDICTING) !!!! Management is always on point if there is a mistake which rarely happens. The only item I wish Blue 32 would improve on is the wine selection. This IS a LOCAL favorite and is busy most days even when other places are not. On Thursday, Friday, Saturday you may want to call ahead to put your name on this list. We have a child so we try to eat here early to avoid the rush or call ahead. This is a family friendly sports bar; the bar is separated from the main restaurant seating area and each location has at least 30 TV's = a sports watchers dream (my husband)."}
{"text":"I love a sports bar that has healthy options!  Love the steamed brocolli and Salmon!"}
{"text":"This a great restaurant in the Gilbert area.  Blue 32 has excellent food, great service and a awesome menu.  The layout is open and friendly with great views of any sporting event on the numerous televisions throughout.  - Bradley Potter www.Yoursevillehome.com"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food the service from the bartenders and wait staff is always courteous and quick. Cant say enough good about this place."}
{"text":"I usually try to stay away from sports bars but I actually suggest this place on date night. LOVE the southwest chicken salad! My husband loves everything on the menu. Great food at great prices. Fast service even when they're packed for games. Tons of TV's. Only wish they had white zin for me!"}
{"text":"What a find! Looking for a cool spot for lunch on a HOT day & found the ultimate sports bar & restaurant. 37 TVs, pick your sport. Salmon salad & candied pecan/goat cheese with chicken were awesome, drinks generous & reasonably priced, service very attentive but not pushy. A problem with \"off-tasting\" drink was readily resolved with a quick replacement. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great beers, decent food and lots of TVs for viewing sporting events. Service is not great. Would go again."}
{"text":"I'll go easy because they just opened this location.  1)  The onion ring batter won't stay on the onion.  The onion was a bit raw too.  Try soaking the rings for 24 hours in buttermilk.  Then coat twice.  Season the flour with garlic and pepper.  Works for me!  2)  The happy hour menu is weak!.  Pretty much chips and snacks type stuff.  Nothing good like sliders etc.  3)  The kids mac & cheese is out of a box.  Really guys?  It takes two seconds to make mac  & cheese from scratch.  Go to allrecipes.com if you need help.  4)  The burger meat is good in flavor but the burger lacks seasoning.  5)  The menu is way too big.  A scaled down menu with better quality would be better.  6)  The nachos are nasty with that queso cheese.  People love traditional nachos.  Stack them high and layer them with cheddar.  all the toppings.  You are a sports bar.  7)  IMO.. drop all of the steaks etc from the menu.  You're a sports bar.  Leave that to Mastros and Flemings.  People want GOOD bar food in a sports bar.  Bottom line....  love the atmosphere, food is OK, beer was cold, price is a little high for what you get, menu is too big, quality of food is OK.  What would I do?  Interview a new fresh Chef to bring in some changes.    Good luck.  I'll stop by again for a happy hour and give you another try.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Every time the food has been great. I love the Grinder sandwich with loaded fries. Not a big fan of walking all the way up to the bar to grab take out."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and it was fantastic.  I had the boneless wings (medium) which were really good!  My husband had the pastrami sandwich and that was excellent as well.  I liked that the place had a family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Atmosphere: Dark, modern, but welcoming. There are about ninety elevated flat screens, with every game and the omnipresent SportsCenter. The bar area is spaced out very well, so everyone is not right on top of one another. The bar is a good size wrap around type.  The Service: Excellent. Each time I've been in I've received personal service from friendly wait staff or bartenders. The managers greet customers as well, and the staff seems to be a great team.  The Food: Good. Nothing mind blowing, but above average. Fresh meat, good sauces, and good veggies. You don't come here for a culinary experience anyway, but you'll leave full and happy.   The Drinks: Good prices even outside of happy hour. Small tap selection, but this is Gilbert. They have chilled mugs, which is cool.   Overall: Blue 32 exceeds my expectations whenever I go in. All in all, it provides a cool sports bar contrast to the pub next door."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere and most of all service. Cory was our server and made our overall experience perfect. The food was great and at a great value. Highly recommend and you should ask for Cory. He is the kind of server you want representing your product! Much aloha!! Jesse & Michelle"}
{"text":"My go to place, been coming here for YEARS. All the food is delicious. Best fries around! Excellent service and once you come in a few times, the servers remember you and your orders. Definite PLUS! Fun place to watch sports and have an awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"Great place to relax with the whole family. A little something for everyone. Good food, cold beer and plenty of TVs to watch a ballgame."}
{"text":"3 Stars means unremarkable to me.  But my 2 experiences at Blue 32 were so weird that I feel compelled to remark.    Last week we visited and sat outside about an hour before sunset.  As far away from the center of the restaurant as possible it was quite relaxing.  Apparently a couple of smokers thought so too, standing within 3 feet of our table as smoke logically drifted our direction.  Staff noticed but ignored them...weird.    I ordered pulled pork with coleslaw and cowboy beans.  The menu must have said \"or\" cowboy beans because they weren't on the curiously-sparse plate.  Service was a little slow, but very friendly, and the food was delicious.  We returned a few days later & I noticed the menu actually did say \"and\" vs. \"or\".  What happened to my cowboy beans?  That felt...weird.  On that same trip she ordered fish tacos.  The portion was a bit small (2 tacos), but also delicious.  Fish tacos are a favorite no matter where we eat so I wasn't surprised that she ordered them on the return trip.  And she LOVED the fries.  This time there were 3 tacos on the plate...weird.  The second visit was inside, smack in the middle of a vast array of silent TVs on various sport channels, mostly washed up jocks talking statistics that you had to lip read.  At least, thanks to acoustics, the patrons and food service sounds were very loud.  So if you go out with someone that you really don't want to talk to, this is the place for you.  You can sit and watch TV over her shoulder while she watches over yours. But for me, that was just...weird.  Although we were close to the bar, the drinks were very slow coming.  I ordered the rib & wing sampler this time.  I'll have to order Hot wings next time because the Medium tasted pretty Mild.  The ribs were very dry, and had only the faintest hint of barbecue sauce.  I like mine juicy and saucy.  Uh, excuse me... I'm talking about baby back ribs here!  I know... I'm weird."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The food is great--portabello mushroom sandwich is great, fries are crunchy, blackened salmon is very good.  Honey b-barbeque wings are good.  Service is friendly and attentive.  They make sure you know when happy hour is ending so you can order if you need to.  Only negative is that wine list is non-existent and house wine is mediocre.  Also can be noisy especially on Friday nights."}
{"text":"Had lunch with friends today at Blue 32.  We sat there for waaaayyyy too long, but the staff made us feel welcome and kept asking if we needed anything else and offered us more drinks. It looks to be a great place for watching \"the game\" because there are plenty of TVs. The food is a step above bar food...but my sliders were very good.  We look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Depends on the B32 you choose... Higley & Chandler Hts = awesome. The one on Val Vista? Hit or miss and pretty inconsistent. Menu is the same but the ambiance is more fun, family friendly and diversified at Higley and Chandler Hts. Visit Val Vista location if you're after more of the sport-loving meathead appeal."}
{"text":"My mom and I had dinner here last night. We came into the restaurant and then remembered that the sweet 16 playoffs were on tv so we weren't sure about even getting a table as the place was packed.  We were seated in 5 minutes. Sadie (sp) our waitress came by to get us drinks very quickly. Sadie was awesome!!! She was knowledgable, helpful, very attentive and friendly. The employees all seemed to work really well together which made things work well.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my mom had the Rueben, both with sweet potato fry's. Both sandwiches were awesome. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"The service is friendly, and quick. Always a pleasure coming in for a delicious meal!!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, but the wait staff was not. They were visiting among themselves and not paying much attention to the customers. I might try one more time...or just go to the Arizona Ave location, where the food and service are both very good!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for beer and a ton if tv's Blue 32 is a good spot to settle at. The three stars is simply because much like most sports bars, the food is very average. It's not bad food, just not great either. If your focus is a game and a cold beverage you'll be happy."}
{"text":"I have been here three times.  The wait staff has been friendly and generally on top of things.  The food isn't cheap but about what I would expect from a price perspective.    Everything I have had to eat has been good.  My disappointment stems from seeking them out as a happy hour spot tonight.  Mistakenly I thought we would go tonight for some discounted drinks and appetizers.  Apparently they consider $3.75 for a 20 oz draft domestic light beer a happy hour price.  I had a 20 oz Leinenkugal and the happy hour price was $4.75.  This represented a 50 cent discount (not even 10% off).  We each had 8 piece boneless wings for $7.25 each.  As noted above they were very good but the price hardly seemed like a happy hour deal.  Ultimately for three draft beers, two orders of wings, and a 20% tip we got out for $36. I know happy hour prices aren't what they used to be but they really need to work on this aspect of their business.  If it weren't happy hour I would have not questioned the prices.  Unfortunately my happy hour pricing experience turned me off on the whole restaurant.  I likely won't be back for awhile.  Happy hour should be a draw, not a detractor."}
{"text":"SO GREAT. The best boneless wings I've ever had, juicy and you can be sure you're getting real, quality white meat. Service is always good and I've never has anything I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Great spot to watch a game with a good variety of beer and food.  The food is pretty decent for a sports bar and priced fairly reasonable.  Very busy on game days so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Love this place!   We've been going here regularly since they opened and have been impressed every time with both the food and the service. I've tried something different each visit and have yet to be disappointed.   The beer selection is good and there isn't a bad seat in the house when it comes to catching a game on TV.   It's great to have this place so close to home. We used to go to the Native since it was close, but it always sucked. I wouldn't be surprised if Blue 32 put them out of business."}
{"text":"Went to blue 32 today and was very pleased! Food was amazing! tacos el carbon were superb.Bathrooms clean, welcomed right when we got there, and service was awesome! Great for kids, and our family go to restaurant! (FYI coldest beers in town!)"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great place for watching the games and drinking a cold one.  They have the Best wings I've ever had.  Lots of meat and crispy every time.  Hummmy!"}
{"text":"Every time we eat at Blue 32 the food and customer service is great, but this past week they went above and beyond.  We had a person in our party who has Celiac disease (can't have cross contamination of gluten) and when I spoke to Chris (the manager) he assured us he would personally oversee the meal to make sure he ate safely.  He went over what was safe on the menu, spoke to our waiter and made sure it was all ok.  It was a huge relief and the food was delicious, as always.  Thank you Blue 32 and Chris!!"}
{"text":"But let down the other night. Food wasn't as good as it has been in the past. Might be a while before we are back. Ugh wish places could stay consistent."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  Great food! TV's everywhere.  I love the buffalo chicken salad and the Mahi tacos."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the service was top notch! And it was SUPER BUSY! The mahi tacos were awesome! Kiera is an incredible server! So busy and yet she was so attentive! Try the bruschetta too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and always great service, even when they are slammed. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Bustling and lively Great tasting Guinness MONTE CRISTO SANDWICH.  This was my first time ever trying a fabled Monte Cristo sandwich. I opted out  of the raspberry dipping sauce which, according to both the waitress and my friend, was a mistake on my part. Such a delicious treat! Paired with a tasty Guinness, my tummy was in heaven!"}
{"text":"Very good food! The Mahi Mahi Foch tacos and steak tacos are excellent. We tried artichoke dip as well I think it's the best I have had. Great service!"}
{"text":"Really love this place, great food, great service, worth the wait during prime times."}
{"text":"I love this sports bar and restaurant. The food was GREAT.  Happy hour was sooooo good. The Mgr Josh is such a good guy and really professional. He has a great work ethic. I told him one little incident that happened, and he took care of it. It was a miscommunication on both our parts. Our martini was perfect. Atmosphere was amazing. Met new friends. Kinda like \"Cheers\". We are from Lagyna Niguel, wish this place was next to us. So long until next year for Spring Training."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place the first time we went. We went last night though and although not horrible, the service was really bad and slow. Our waiter had his wife and screaming kid sitting in the table next to us. We never got our waters. Our appetizer came out in 20 minutes, it was good. Our entrees were still not out 20 minutes later so we opted to leave because it was getting late. The icing on the cake was when the waiter told us that we wouldn't be charged for the entrees that never came. Gee thanks, silly."}
{"text":"I went here For the second time last night. Got the bruschetta appetizer, a few beers and a bacon cheeseburger that my wife and I split. The waitress was nice enough to bring us The food divided in half on two different plates. Service was great, food was delicious. Fun atmosphere. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Came here on Sunday for lunch. Swiss mushroom burger. Huge and delicious with yummy fries. Steak tacos were yummy too. Why do people with small kids insist on coming to a bar where everyone is drinking and watching sports while trash talking. Please go somewhere kid friendly. That is my only complaint."}
{"text":"Over the years Blue 32 has been in Gilbert I haven't found a single thing to complain about. The food is outstanding - every single time. The staff is friendly, wonderful, welcoming and accomodating. It seems the turnover is very low as the same faces have been serving for a long time.   Everything on the menu is awesome. Literally - I have tried everything.   And, best of all - it is superbly clean."}
{"text":"Classy, clean sports bar with great food and great service. I have been here many times and was just there again this past weekend. We had about 15 people in our party and we were seated right away. Our waitress, Dalice was very friendly and didn't miss a thing. Drinks were brought out quickly and the refills just kept coming. All the food orders came out in a decent time frame and not one person had anything bad to say about the food. I had the buffalo chicken wrap. The chicken was cooked perfectly and it had just the right amount of sauce on it. I am not a sports fan so I don't care about the TV's and the set up but I did notice that no matter where you sat you had a view of multiple TV's.  Another great experience at Blue 32!"}
{"text":"Good food, better than most sports bars. A little pricey for me."}
{"text":"The food was-eh---I gotta say that I was really looking forward to the enchilada soup, but it just wasn't the same. The other location was better. The service was--eh--- our waitress was super nice but it was busy so we didn't see too much of her. I got the blackened shrimp tacos. I wouldn't recommend them, everything at this particular location lacked luster"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week when we are not traveling.  Their Mediterranean flat bread is like crack cocaine.  It is rather large, but ... I ate the whole thing and still wanted more.  We've tried may of their dishes here: fish tacos, philly cheese steak, buffalo chicken salad, buffalo chicken sandwich, etc.  They are all super good."}
{"text":"Mediocre also over priced food, gave it a chance and was let down.. I had myself a Philly cheesesteak and it was basically ground beef on a piece of bread, I asked for extra meat prior to receiving it and was charged and extra 5 dollars. Will not go back, thanks."}
{"text":"The food has gone considerably downhill at this location.  I was a regular until the past few visits with horrible food.  Considering lunch or dinner for two here will run you at least $30, save your money and skip it.  Service is decent."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. I had the chopped chicken salad which was mostly iceberg lettuce some small bits of bacon a couple pieces of chicken and old avocado. They wanted to up charge me for more dressing so I declined but there was hardly enough to coat all the lettuce. My guests got the buffalo chicken sandwich with cold soggy sweet potato fries. And the buffalo chicken flat bread which was chewy and undercooked. Service was horrible, it was like pulling teeth to get a refill because our server (who seemed to be new) was too busy chatting by the door with a group of other servers. She didn't even ask if I wanted a refill until she was clearing our plates away. Probably one of the least impressive sports bars I've been to. We will just stick to Zipps."}
{"text":"By far the best sports bar in the east valley.  The food is amazing and the service has always been great.  Once you try Blue 32 it will be your favorite place to go watch a game with your homeboys or to take your wife out for a amazing steak dinner.  The best of both worlds."}
{"text":"First time to eat here. Stopped for lunch, ordered Chicken Fingers with fries, and a small side order of onion rings. Every chicken finger was stringy and fatty, a little undercooked. Onion rings were greasy and fell apart. Worst lunch I have eaten out in a long time. My friend that I met there had made the suggestion to go there. I asked him if he had ever eaten there before and he said it was his first time to eat there. Next time, I will make the suggestion to go elsewhere. Maybe other items on the menu are good, or maybe it is just a good place for drinking, but I will not be back."}
{"text":"Large seating area that handled the crowds during high-season in Arizona very well. Convenient eating spot next to Harkins theater. Lots of TVs to watch the sporting events of your liking. I was slightly disappointed with my meal - Pesto Chicken Pasta. Had very little chicken it despite it being in the name of the dish. There was enormous amounts of artichoke and mushrooms - maybe it should be called \"Pesto Artichoke Pasta\". Everyone else in our group had large protein portions - maybe I just got unlucky this time. I'll give it another try if I'm out of options."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered TO GO one night to try it out. We live right down the road from them, so it was nice to be able to get nice food TO GO instead of fast food. We both ordered the Blue 32 burgers. Seriously the best burgers we ever had. Both were cooked how we asked them to. The quality of ingredients was excellent. The Blue 32 burger comes with blue cheese. My husband got the burger as it comes, and I substituted the blue cheese for goat cheese. They did not skimp on the blue or the goat. The amount of these nice cheeses they put on top far exceeded our expectations. We were so happy with our food that we called them as soon as we were done to tell them what a great job they did."}
{"text":"Honestly, was very pleasantly surprised.  Good bar area, no loud blaring TVs like a chain sports bar, and nice service.  The food was surprisingly good.  Chicken fried chicken was done very well and didn't seem like any generic bar food product.  Prices were reasonable, especially on happy hour.  No complaints and will be back"}
{"text":"This is a typical sports bar. They have decent food for a sports bar. I have tried the calamari - over priced and small portion, tacos- really tasty beef, and tortilla soup - awesome.   Over all this would be my 2nd choice for a sports bar. There is better."}
{"text":"Huge fan!  Great food, fun atmosphere and attentive service.  They have a diverse menu and everything we've tried is delicious.  We've brought several people to try it and they all loved it."}
{"text":"Nice place. Friendly Sports bar/restaurant. Tons of TV's. Homemade soups. I recommend the appetizer bbq ribs are wonderful...like butter off a bone. Not impressed with their fries. Large portions and a very large selection on the beer menu"}
{"text":"We came in for lunch on a Monday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. We started with the pastrami sliders, which were delicious. Then ordered the BBQ chicken flatbread and fish n' chips. The flatbread was pretty large - more than enough for two people to share, and the fish n' chips was a little too fried. There was little fish and lots of fried breading. We also ordered the Dos Equis iceberg and for whatever reason it tasted like a watered down beer. We have eaten here before and had better success with the food, so we will most likely come back to give it another try."}
{"text":"This place is great. The service is always good, ton of TV's where TV's should be. The philly cheesesteak is really good. If you want to try something different go for the Monte Cristo. They have Four peaks pumpkinporter too..... Burgers and the rest are on point."}
{"text":"Never dissapointed here! College football happy hour is from 9 am to 5 Pm, longer if there are late night games. Cant wait for the NFL season to come by and have a few pints. Great beer on tap always. Had some sliders today, damn good."}
{"text":"We noticed this sports bar open a couple of weeks ago so we decided to try it out.  When you walk in the place is very impressive.  They have TV's everywhere.  It seemed like the worst seat in house would have at least 5 tvs to watch.  They had a pretty good beer selection and they carry many more beers on draft than just light beers.     My wife ordered the coconut shrimp for her entre (an appetizer), and the edamame for an appetizer.  I got the Philly Cheesesteak.   The food was pretty good.  I really liked the fries that came with the Philly Cheesesteak.    Another thing I really liked was that if an employee walked by and noticed you had an empty plate or if it looked like you needed something they would help you out.  The waitress was not the only person who seemed to care about how you were doing.  I really hope they keep this up.    Overall I definitely will be a repeat customer.  Gilbert needed a place that was nice, laid back, good food, and good beer."}
{"text":"Great service, great (bar food). This area needed Blue 32 bad. I've brought my family here around 6 times, only had one bad experience that came from a inexperienced hostess had had us wait over 25 minutes."}
{"text":"Very clean , fast service, portions are good   , our server Annie was very friendly and attentive ( best 2 qualities  for a server) Hot sauce for wings could be hotter but that's just me . Overall very  good experience and I'll be back  4 sure"}
{"text":"Have been a loyal patron for years and I tell everyone about how awesome the food is here!  Had out of town guests last Saturday and really wanted to introduce them to Blue 32.  The hostess completely ignored me, standing right in front of her, not once but TWICE, and seated people who came in after me, while I stood there!  Very unhappy!!!  I will never be back!  I'm pretty good sized to miss seeing!  No excuse!!"}
{"text":"I am not a sports person and I don't go for the thousands of TVs on the walls. I go purely for one thing: the calamari. My sister and I regularly go there for our lunch dates JUST for the calamari. It is always so tender and the batter is nice and flavorful, kinda salty but that doesn't bother us. We literally devour it within minutes. It's amaze!"}
{"text":"One of the best Sports Bars I have been to. Great atmosphere and the food is delicious. Especially liked the onion rings. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Have been going here with my kids almost weekly for a long time and has been fairly decent overall.  Today I had the worst lunch I've had in recent memory.  Ordered the fish & chips, so I understand I'm in for a bit of grease, but it was dripping in it from the fish and onto the fries below it.  The coleslaw was basically DRY cabbage with a little bacon mixed in.  Terrible.  The waitress was oblivious as I told her my food was nasty and just asked me if I wanted to box up the remaining 7/8 of all the food I let her take away.  Never said anything else about it and I just paid the $12.99 because I wasn't in the mood for an argument and just wanted to get out of there.  There were also an obnoxious number of flies buzzing around our table and everyone else's, which didn't help the atmosphere.  I'd say they could focus more on quality than quantity as the portions are ridiculously big.  2 teenagers and I average about $50 for lunch,  including one draft beer, but pretty pricey for the food and atmosphere.  Taking a long break from it, if I ever go back."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Lots of TVs but I mean come on its a bar and grill there are 100s of these around these days. that being said the service was terrible. It was a Saturday and must have been only 2 services for the bar tables but literally the girl took forever and I was almost done with my meal by the time she asked if it was tasting good. Price point is per usual for a bar and grill."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is usually very good. All their meat is fresh, never frozen. The Grilled Chicken Avocado Club sandwich is great with the bbq beans. Tacos al Carbon are great. Wings are very good too. My daughter enjoyed the flatbread pizza. We refer this restaurant often and everyone has enjoyed it. I don't recommend sitting outside. There is ambience inside but none outside."}
{"text":"Great place to come to watch a game. Tons of TVs with every game on. Great food and drinks. Awesome service. Food came out fast and was delicious. Lots of options for food. Was seated quickly on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Stopped in recently on a Friday night, place was pretty empty. I think I know why. Dim the lights and maybe the place will have a sports bar atmosphere. Didn't stay to eat, I forgot my sunglasses."}
{"text":"I came to this location since it was close to my hotel and near the movie theater. I had the hot chicken wings which were decent, but not very hot (spicy), they were cooked well and tasty. Service was decent I was sitting at the bar, so it's hard to have bad service at the bar. Overall the place was good they had all the games on and about 20-30 TV's."}
{"text":"Moving to Southeast Gilbert can be rough if you do not want to eat at a chain place or travel 20+ minutes. We were so happy to find B32SG. The service is always great. So much so, I have even gone out of my way to speak to the manager to compliment our server. Everything we have had has been great and super fresh. The bread they use is delicious and I love bread! The husband orders a burger no matter where we go and I just pretend like it doesn't drive me crazy. But 32's bacon cheeseburger is to die for with the most amazing bacon. It was so good I ordered it twice in a row because I could not stop craving it. The only food I wasn't crazy for was the patty melt. It was dripping withe grease and I found it kind of gross. Maybe that's how patty melts are supposed to be, I'm not sure as it was my first. It's usually crowded here but, we have never waited long. The parking is inadequate and jammed, though it never stops me from coming. It can get super loud and depending on your neighboring tables the language is not always appropriate for small kids. We did have a pretty shoddy experience tonight when trying to place a to-go order over the phone. I called & had to be transferred to place my order. No one ever answered! While I was still on hold my husband called and had the same experience. I hung up at 8:30 & called back only to get a constant busy signal. I tried calling again at 9:30 to have the phone just ring and ring. I was very surprised to find out they are only open till 10, even on the weekends. Hopefully, this was only a one time hiccup. Overall this place is great and we are big fans."}
{"text":"Go here 2 or 4 times a month. The food is good but lately the beer is never cold. Lots of new places in Gilbert with COLD beer & good food. Moving to cold beer."}
{"text":"We have eaten here at least 10 times and the food is always great. Love the salads, burgers, sandwiches and main plates available. Lots to choose from. Service has been consistently good."}
{"text":"Wow i have never been to a bar/restaurant where they let people with new born(and I am talking spitting and pooping no idea where they are at) at the bar. Not the tables in the bar area but the actual bar that we sit at and get drinks on. All you people that have new born babies you ought to hit this place up every night, you can sit around toss the new born up say your \"oh how cute he/she is\" and slobber on everything until they poop their pants and then take the kid to the restroom to clean them up, I am being nice here but come on, there was only 20 people in the whole place with tables available galore. Even if it is legal, which I do not know, can't you let adults sit at the bar and leave the screaming crying pooping spitting kids somewhere else in the establishment? The parents should be ashamed of themselves, you have thousands of choices for dinner, why, why why??????  Totally disappointed and believe me I write a review once in a blue moon and usually only when they are good...  P.S.Management did nothing about this and actually encouraged it...   Very disappointed customer..."}
{"text":"LOVE the food here and the staff is just as good! Lone of my fave hangouts! The Spinach Artichoke Dip is to die for. I also recommend the Chili Cheese Fries, Nachos and their sandwiches. The whole menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"So we've been going to Blue 32 for years, and when they first opened, this was a 5 star sports bar, no question. Unfortunately with time the staff is slipping and food quality has gone down. Still a great place with great food, but it's gone from a \"highly recommend\" spot to a \"good place to go\".   If you're there to watch a game (yeah, I know...in a sports bar?...how odd...) they have tons of good TVs well located throughout the dining area.   Not sure what they do to the nachos,  but they're like crack! In fact I'm in NA (Nachos Anonymous) to try and break the habit.   I hope they refocus and get back to what made them so popular...great food with great atmosphere, all in a sports bar."}
{"text":"My family and I really like Blue 32. The food is always on point and the servers are friendly and keep on top things. I always recommend this place to friends and family when they come into town."}
{"text":"Food is great. The service is great. I highly recommend this place.  My wife and I like to grab lunch here. The lunch specials are good. I had their brownie ice cream dessert once. It was delicious.  For some reason they've been out of fresh brownies since then. I'd like for them to bring the dessert back.  Update...9/19/14....went to the Blue 32 to grab a quick dessert with my lady and they had brownies again!  Nice!"}
{"text":"Great place to go watch a game and the food is very good. Wait staff friendly and professional"}
{"text":"If you get Morgan as a server, ask for a new one because she's the shittiest server there. Very rude, and takes a very long time do anything, very poor service."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials! It's nice to get a drink close  and watch a game and not spend too much money. I had the chips and queso as well and those were pretty good to snack on. Service has always been great as we"}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in on the way home from freestone park, after reading the yelp reviews. Atmosphere was much nicer than a typical sports bar and the food was great. Again, not expecting much because it's a sports bar, but we had a restaurant quality dinner. I had the Tacos Al Carbon, he had a chicken ceaser. Food gets 5 starts, for sports bar food. However, my beer was grossly overpriced IMO. Happy hour price for 16oz draft was 4.25. The exact same beer on Taco Tuesday at El Palacio is 2.25. And domestics at 3.25 are overpriced too, the same domestics at BWW during happy hour are only $3 for a 22oz tall one! I have no clue what regular prices are, but for happy hour, I'm not all that happy. Great for food, not so great if you plan to have a few beers. Dinner for two, with two beers was $47. That's a bit steep for a sports bar."}
{"text":"We were very excited to have this establishment down in our neck of the woods. I have visited the Val Vista and Williams field location a few times and have always had fantastic service, this location is certainly no exception. The staff is fantastic and very attentive,  the food always comes out hot even when they are packed to the gilla.. but my favorite part are katie and sally, if you are lucky enough to be  sat in their sections there is no doubt you will have an enjoyable service. I do have one complaint- the misters on the patio need a little re engineering. . It appears they have maybe a five minute timer on them and are constantly turning off and on.."}
{"text":"Great grilled chicken sandwich, buffalo chicken rocks and the philly cheese steak is wicked good!!! Great service as well."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! We don't have very many choices down in this part of town for restaurants, but with Blue 32 here we don't need them because we would chose this place any day of the week. My husband and my 3 kiddos love going here! We have never had a bad experience. Our servers are always friendly and super kind. Sometimes when we go places with our 3 kids, servers seem to immediately write us off thinking we won't tip or we'll just be super needy, but never here! All of the servers and the management are always so kind and make a point to talk to my kiddos. They love it and so do we!  We have tried just about everything here between us and have never been disappointed!  The kids love that they can get fresh strawberries as a side. My husband and I love that they have Papago Orange Blossom on tap! See we're all happy...a little something for everyone! Sometimes there is a bit of a wait because it is pretty much the only actual restaurant down here...but I assure you it is worth every minute!!"}
{"text":"Blue 32 is my families favorite restaurant to go to. We meet friends there, we meet family there, and everyone that we have taken with us has loved it as well. I've read through some of the other reviews and if they gave less than 5 stars they are not eating at the same restaurant as me. The prices are moderate, the food always tastes the same no matter who is cooking, good. The food is flavorful and I've ordered many different items on the menu and they are all delicious. The happy hour is amazing. Sundays during football season are a little crowded but that is to be expected, and it is not because it is full of \"homeless\" people like one of the reviews by Anthony stated. It is full of people drinking, eating, watching football and having an amazing time. If you have never tried Blue 32 it needs to be on your places to go."}
{"text":"Good service, Good food.  Great place to watch a game and the buffalo flatbread and chicken ranch flatbreads are awesome."}
{"text":"it's Gilbert what did you expect, Scottsdale?   but it is a good family fun place where the naughty Mormons come out after Temple services and this place is a  hell of a self-esteem booster when you're people watching the locals.  Fact is the Beer is cold... the food is, well did i mention the Beer is cold  :-)    I like the place :-)   Enjoy"}
{"text":"I don't live here and chose this place because I was in Chandler and the reviews were great. For lunch, had the grinder sandwich and fries. Lots of really good food. Will be bringing my mom, niece and nephews again this weekend. Lots of items to choose from"}
{"text":"Poor excuse for Buffalo Wild Wings knock off.  Location is its strength and only that."}
{"text":"I'm in love with their onion rings.  I also have the ribs and fries appetizer quite often.  The people are all really friendly and they are more than happy to put your game on one of their TV's.  I watch my Kansas City Royals there all the time!"}
{"text":"This has turned in to our post volleyball regular spot basically for lack of options in the area. Thankfully, the food is edible and the drinks are strong. Service has been hit and miss but always friendly. Has potential to be a great neighborhood bar but needs a bit of finessing.   So far I've only ordered off the appetizer and late night (after 10 p.m.) menus, but I do like their calamari and spinach dip. I've heard good things about the shrimp po' boy but can't vouch for it myself.  The drinks are priced right IMHO. What can't you love about a double cocktail strong enough to give you the shivers and served up for less than $9?!  They have lots of flat screens that are most tuned to ESPN and Fox Sports, and they supposedly show the major live sports events.  Will keep my fingers crossed that it continues to improve."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad. I love wings, and didn't really care for them here. However, my wife got the rib appetizer and said they were the best ribs she's ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I am usually very picky about eating dinner at a sports grill. However, Blue 32 has great food, good appetizers, timely service during games, and a balanced environment.  Usually in a sports bar on a Saturday night the service is slow and the food takes forever to make it to the table. Blue 32 was the opposite. Salad came out right after I ordered and the food was out before I finished my salad. I've been here a few times and every time has been a great experience."}
{"text":"If you have never been to Blue32, you have never had the Best Burger in Gilbert...oh Hell, in the Southeast Valley! I'm not talking about a burger with all the fixing's or smothered in mouth watering sauces. I'm talking about the taste and flavor of the burger alone! To me, a Burger is Good, when it doesn't need anything to make it better. Aside from my homemade burgers, these burgers are the BEST around! Tired of hearing about the Burgers? Blue32 is just a casual, great place to watch a game, have a Beer (or a few), and eat some delicious appetizers. The Hot Wings, Sliders, Chicken Quesadillas, Ahi Tuna, Calamari, and Onion Rings are all great, to name a few. The Tacos Al Carbon leave you wanting more and the Prime Rib Special (not on menu) was to die for! All in All, Blue32 is a great Sports Bar and Grill that specializes in serving quality food with friendly service. Two Thumbs Up...WAY UP! ;)"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time a week ago. The location was new (only open a week) and running pretty well. The wait was 40 minutes on a Friday night, but expected. First, the food was good, hot, and fresh. The staff was crazy amazing as the waiter stopped at the table too many times to count to check on drinks and update us on the food order. Very attentive! Blue 32 management played it smart, they brought staff from their other locations to help the new staff. That was definitely apparent based on the food and service.  The only enhancement I would suggest is the patio. It is plain and not private enough (in my opinion) for customer privacy. The inside is great as the setup is lighted well and the tables are situated in groups that make it feel cozy. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Blue 32: The name makes me think of Jim Carey in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, so firstly, I love the name because it makes me smile.  Great location, great atmosphere, fresh and consistently tasty food, average to outstanding service (just once experienced average server, which is why I didn't give it 5-stars) - it almost doesn't get any better! Best burgers anywhere I have tried - they are actually fresh...imagine that!?  Onion rings and fries are superb, the salads are quite filling, and darned tasty! Corbin and Mike have been our best servers so far since we started patronizing Blue.  My hubby and I are very picky eaters, with sensitive stomachs, so this place is TOPS! Talk about an establishment that does it right and actually takes some pride in its appearance, food quality, and cleanliness.    We normally do not care for the sports bar/restaurant types of establishments, but Blue 32 truly does it right, hands down the best we have seen!  Nothing frozen there except the ice, the ice cream, and maybe some frozen drinks.    Hope they keep up the exceptional work because we need to have somewhere nice to eat that won't dissapoint like most other so-called restaurants have done. Way to go, Blue-32!"}
{"text":"This has become our go to restaurant. We have been there 3 times and the food has always been consistently excellent. Highly recommend the Tacos El Carbon! We always enjoy the outdoor seating and usually have it all to ourselves. The wait staff has been very attentive. Can't wait to explore more of the menu!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites.  Great salads.  Country fried chicken.  Tacos al carbon.  Lots of tvs. Can be a little cool if you are under a vent(so my wife tells me)."}
{"text":"Love this place! My hubby and I have a standing date on Mondays for lunch. I'll admit we always get the bone in wings. We order them naked and grilled with hot sauce on the side and you have to get the blue cheese dressing with them. Their blue cheese is the best EVER, super chunky!  My husband loves the 8th Street Ale.  Their patio is decent although overlooks the parking lot. Jennifer, at the Higley location, takes great care of us so no complaints on the service. They participate in the \"No Wait\" app so I suggest using that if it's a weekend night. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love the environment, plenty to see and still comfortable to converse with friends at the table.  The food is tasty, from crisp salads to variety of entrees.  Seems like everyone is always enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"It was so incredibly loud on Sunday afternoon for NFL that my ears ached! The nachos were ok. I will not be back and if you want to preserve your hearing don't go."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food, good service!  Have tried several items on the menu and all good.  If you are going during a big game, usually pretty crowded.  Go to a different sports bar then."}
{"text":"Wife and I went in about 230. Not busy. Upon entry of the establishment, it had a poignant oder. Quiried my wife about staying. Maybe it was just at the entrance. We stayed. Hamburger good, Mahi tocos mediocre.   My wife didn't want to stay any longer due to the oder. She had it boxed to go.  This type of oder is usually related to a negative pressure of the building and dry traps.  The building should alievate this issue before it impacts it's business."}
{"text":"Great food but long waits.  I love their fresh menu with the favorites being: chicken fried chicken,  blackened chicken alfredo, tacos carbone, salmon, rib eye.....  just to name a few.  We often just do takeout and this works great."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends and everything we ordered was really good! One of my favorites is the cheesesteak sandwich and the fried chicken. Really good size portions so come hungry! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good spot... Bruschetta is fresh  Have tried several items . Need to add TURKEY BURGER to menu. Need little help with wait staff hit/miss Can be really load with all the TV's  Be warned big crowds on game days."}
{"text":"Good food, good service & friendly staff. Fair pricing for the portions you get. Pretty good place to watch a game. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Always have good experiences here.  Great service on most occasions, and food is excelllent. I had a minor issue one time, and manager personally resolved it.  I frequent here often."}
{"text":"So i heard many good things, but our experience was very bad.  We showed up at 5:30 on a Thursday, We were seated right away and gave our order.  45 minutes later we got an extra well done burger vs the med rare we asked for.  We brought it to their attention and they brought us a new one, this time it was very rare, like not cooked and not edible.  So they offered us dessert on the house and we choose cookies.  Of course, 2 of them were not cooked all the way through.  The manager apologized several times and said they were having a bad night.  But seriously, if you cannot cook a hamburger or cookies right, you should not be in business.  So it still costs us over $30 for 5 small chicken wings, 2 sodas and some way overly seasoned tacos.  NOT WORTH THE MONEY and HEADACHES.  Hopefully their Other locations are run better and i do not plan on returning- EVER."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey, but the food is good.  The carnival tacos have a good smile flavor to them and a yummy tomatillo/jalape√±o salsa. Black beans are buttery.  Bartenders are always friendly and attentive.  Good beer selection."}
{"text":"Great food. Must have the buffalo shrimp. Burgers are great too. The beer is ice cold and there are dozens of tv's."}
{"text":"First off, the food and the service were excellent.   The reason they lost two stars for my review is that we called ahead to specifically ask what football game they were playing as their main game with audio since we didn't have it televised at home. They told me it was my team playing, but once we got there, ordered, and the game started, it was a different game that was on, so we had to watch our game without audio. I'm not a huge fan, but go to support my husband's interest, so to watch without audio took all the fun out for me (since I didn't know what was going on most of the time). :("}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Great atmosphere, great service, great food and reasonable prices...only 5 minutes away.  The ribs are, as claimed on their menu, fall-off-the-bone fantastic.  The Philly cheese steak sandwich is also a winner.    Thank you to whoever owns & operates this chain of restaurants for having the vision to come so far south in the east valley.  We appreciate having you here and for serving the community with such a varied and wonderful menu."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour! And, you've got to try their Monte Cristo sandwhich. Their nachos w/queso is awesome as well. I love the atmosphere. Clean and great service. You can't go wrong with this spot."}
{"text":"Weekly we go to Blue 32 on Higley Rd for their awesome food, especially the salmon salad.  The location is 2 miles from our house..yay  The staff are darling young people with great personalities,  They always bring out our food hot and visit with us old guys. (senior citizens) The hostess, Ady, goes out of her way to be friendly and helpful.  Last night my hubby had a headache and she found 2 advil for him.  The server Jessica, has such a great personality we feel very comfortable with her.  She goes out of her way every time we stop by to make us laugh and enjoy our meal more.  LOVE BLUE 32"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS BLUE 32!!!! HAIR IN FOOD!!!!!! STILL CHARGED FOR BILL!!!  My family and I have been going to Blue 32 since 2009 and were very excited when a new location opened near our house. My father and I stopped by today for a snack and a cocktail. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and 2 cocktails. This is normally our favorite. My father had a piece of the bread loaded with the artichoke cheese dip right to his mouth when I saw something weird sticking out of the dip on the bread.  I grabbed it. Pulled. An 8 inch human hair slid out of the thick artichoke dip atop the bread as I pulled. I immediately vomited down my shirt and pants. I was disgusted and mortified!!!! We called a waitress over and she apologized, cleared the dish from the table and asked if we wanted something else!!!!  What??? No! I just vomited up what you gave me due to the large human hair it it. Here is the Kicker. We received a bill for our two cocktails-which were not finished because we were both so grossed out. When I expressed my displeasure upon leaving the Manager assured me she had taken care of the situation by not charging me for the hairy artichoke dip. BE CAREFUL AT THE BLUE 32. CHECK YOUR FOOD FOR FOREIGN OBJECTS. BE PREPARED TO PAY FOR \"WHATEVER\" YOU GET!  POOR SERVICE BLUE 32!!!!! EXPECTED MORE FROM YOUR CHAIN!!!! We will never patronize any of your establishments again!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sports bar. The food is great! Wings are ok, but ask for extra crispy and grilled and they come out pretty good."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Blue 32. We use to live across the way from here and this was our go - to place, now we live in Mesa, BUT thank goodness for Postmates! My husband love the Black and Blue Burger and always gets it, I always order the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club, with sweet potato fries. The chicken is the best marinade I have ever tasted on chicken. The bacon is perfectly thick and the sauce OMGosh! We usually order take out every Friday night!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad plate yet! Great food and beer specials. Sometimes a wait but that's normal for a sports bar."}
{"text":"Get the buffalo chicken wrap!! It's soooo good. Everything is good portioned and I have yet to try something that I don't like. We've had the same server the past few times and she's great too. It's a spacious place with a lot of tv's. I'd recommend if you're looking for a casual spot with bar like food to watch the game or just hang out. Happy hour is pretty cheap too!"}
{"text":"Average quality food, typical bar quality service (slow, inattentive).   Wide variety of choices on menu, but nothing on our table really stood out beyond ordinary.   OK place if you're already in in the neighborhood,  but not a destination by itself.     The inside acoustics made it very loud.   All concrete floors.   Nearly impossible to speak with others at the table.    I'm not likely to return.  Too many other choices in that center."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best spinach artichoke dip in the state! It gets crowded so show up early!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant, I love their onion rings!"}
{"text":"This place is great for football - they have plenty of screens and give you a TV layout of which games are on which TV. If you get there early enough, you've got your pick of tables so that you can watch whatever game you want.  The morning games are easier to get a table then the afternoon ones - when we left, there was a line out the door and people were pouncing on you to see if you were staying for the afternoon games or leaving.  The food was good too, and they serve a breakfast menu till 10:30."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 or 4 times now so I figure it's about time I share my thoughts:  Pros - Great beer selection, I mean seriously short of going to the Yard House you won't find more choices. - Nice flat screen tvs throughout the place covering all the major sports channels. - Good burgers.  I've tried a few, my favorite is the Black n Bleu. - Sweet Potato Fries, I love them! - Bartenders did a nice job with takeout order once.  Cons - Buffalo Wings are not great.  Ordered their hot and it didn't even make my tongue tingle. - Ketchup is served in a little plastic cup.  It's a pet peeve of mine.  Give me the bottle! - Service can be hit or miss.  The managers at night appear to be much more on top of things than during a Sunday Lunch.   Summing it up, nice option in the area when you get tired of GB across the street or want something next to the movies."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's quick and the food is good  I usually get the tacos al carbon which are very tasty. Anything you get on the menu is pretty delicious."}
{"text":"First timer and it was erl electric on Thursday night in February! ASU vs UofA a nd fans going crazy with every turn overr and dunk! It made Native New Yorker look like a preschool sporting event! Tv's were located at the perfect height. Fried pickles were delish. I had the classic burger (medium well) and it was so juicy! I give their burgers a 10 for taste. Hands down. Our extraordinary server was above professional and so up-beat and positive. I'll remember his name forever: Regal. We are a small business owner and we know when we see quality, professional service. Regal was on it; drink refills, food delivery and positivity. Regal had it all! I will be back because of his A+ service. Place was filled but we only waited 2 minutes to be seated. I'll be back Blue32!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! I HIGHLY recommend the Pesto Chicken Pasta. My dad lovesss the Buffalo chicken salad. He says it's \"the bomb dot com.\""}
{"text":"The food was about average for any sports bar/restaurant, nothing spectacular. First problem was we were dining inside and there were flies everywhere. All the tables around us were shoeing away flies constantly as were we. When we received our order I noticed when I was eating that my plate was dirty from the meal before. I complained to the server as well as asking for the manager. The server saw the dirty and said \"WOW, THE PLATE IS STILL DIRTY ISN'T IT\" and went on to one of her other tables. Not even a let me reorder it with a clean plate, nothing.  I would have thought that the cook in the back would have noticed a dirty plate as mine was very noticeable and I never did have a manager come by. Left my meal behind. I don't think that we will be back. I ended up having to pay for a meal on a dirty plate that I did not eat, no comp, nothing.  Could have ended on a positive note but they truly dropped the ball.  Too bad..."}
{"text":"Great food and nice setting.  From the moment we walked in, the service was  not great. Took almost 10 minutes for a hostess to come address us and find us a seat. Nobody in front of us and we just stood at the front of a restaurant that wasn't even  at 25% capacity.  Service was marginal at best.  Waitress displayed very little effort with checking on us, refilling drinks, etc.  Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"1 star bc I couldn't give none. Whatever my waitress' is, she was rude. Took 15 mins for me to get a menu and 30 mins for my friend to get a refill. Her service was horrible. We'd have to stop her in passing. When I placed my order, she sighed as if I was bothering her. Loaded fries are good but Definitely not coming back!"}
{"text":"We love Blue 32. Awesome place. Just walked out of crappy thirsty lion.  We should of just came here to begin with.  Great food great prices and the best servers. Hands down."}
{"text":"When we walked in and were seated, Josh immediately greeted us and got our drinks. Charles was the best server we've ever had- I swear, these guys treated us like VIP's. I definitely recommend this place- spinach artichoke dip and the black&blue burger were AMAZING! A+"}
{"text":"Love Blue 32.  The turkey Rueben is phenomenal, while my wife's favorite are the fish tacos and any of the salads.  Great game watching, good setup, Clean.  Good service.  Glad to have them close."}
{"text":"Blue 32 has a great atmosphere and great food.  My recommendation is the Monte Cristo only ask for honey instead of the preserves.  Do a light dunk of the sandwich in the honey and it is wonderful!  It is made exactly the same as the Country Club where I grew up.  I have ordered many over the years but there's is the best.  Great place close to home, we stop in frequently and always have great service and food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service is great. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it's a little pricey. As far as bar food goes, you can't beat it"}
{"text":"Great food,  reasonable prices, variety in the menu selections, laid back atmosphere and excellent wait staff(loved Ali)!  Stopped in for lunch not knowing what to expect aside from other reviews and was not let down."}
{"text":"We ended up here to watch the Packers/Giants game. Total random choice, and not a bad one! We had to wait a few minutes for a table, nothing major, and the food being delivered as we waited all looked delicious!  Our table had a variety--burgers, sandwiches, sliders, mashed potatoes, fries, beer, soda, a bloody mary, and a long island. No bad choices or bad reviews.  Service was good (Clint), quick on the refills, and checked in on us several times. Good atmosphere, every table had a view of at least one tv.  May have to go check it out for a hockey game?!"}
{"text":"We live in Fulton Ranch and are very excited to have Blue 32 in our community. My husband and I frequently visited their other locations often. The food is great and always consistent. I love their \"Cosmos\" and my hubby says the beer is always cold. The servers are all very friendly. Welcome to South Chandler!!"}
{"text":"We visited this place for the first time last weekend. The service and food were excellent even though the restaurant was full, we didn't have to wait to get our food. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the wings. My son loves to eat buffalo wings and sorry but the wings here don't taste like buffalo, the buffalo wing sauce was kind of yellow with a different flavor."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best steak dinners we've ever had in a sports bar! Always cooked to perfection (we order Med Rare) and a decent portion for the price. I just had to get that out of the way before I forget...  Overall food selection is very good. If it wasn't for the tons of TVs and servers wearing game day jerseys, you'd think you were in a family restaurant. Wings are also very good and the calamari is also a favorite. Drink specials vary and could be better on game days, but the ample viewing area makes up for the neglect of game day drink specials.  Downside? Has become very popular! Proof that establishments like these are needed in this area. Additionally, they don't take reservations so if you have a large party the best bet is to call ahead and arrange for a table - though depending on the day they can't always accommodate.  Service has always been decent. No concerns there. Just a reminder to the wait staff that if you are placing a wet glass please be sure to place a cocktail napkin or coaster first.   Would rate it 4.5 stars but alas we can only do single digits, This location will not disappoint you. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is always a staple and a go to when we are considering heading out for lunch, dinner or for fun.  They always have great service and food is always amazing.  You would think this place is your prototypical sports bar....and it is in a way, but the selection of drinks and food set this place atop all others.  You should go.....like now!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorites for sure & one of our go-to restaurants! The bruschetta, nachos and spinach artichoke dip are wonderful! The Philly cheesesteak salad is also really good. My husband always gets the buffalo chicken wrap. Good service, great food, & fun atmosphere... Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Usually order wings and burgers, usually good. Switched it up and bought a steak. Did not taste as much as it cost. Like chewing on tasteless piece of meat, came with red potatoes that must of been doused in salt before they came out. And on top of that the service was lacking, a lot. Steak got cold before I could ask for steak sauce and get it."}
{"text":"Hop knot on tap, a menu full of food to please the fat kid in me, it really doesn't get much better.  Service has been great on my many trips in with the old lady, we live across the street and there aren't many good spots at this price point in the area.   This is a bonafide sports bar but the big upside is that they actually use fresh ingredients unlike local spots like Zipps and Tilted Kilt.  The burgers are good and all sandwiches come on good bread with fresh toppings.  Any of the chicken items are actually real chicken breast, no frozen chicken fingers which is rare.  If you're feeling extra fat, go for the Monte Cristo as it's pretty damn amazing despite sounding like a fast track to diabetes.    My only desire is that they would buy UFC fights so I can stumble home safely but maybe that would ruin this little gem."}
{"text":"Our first time back in along time. We had Ace for our waiter. He was very nice and professional. However, he failed to tell us about happy hour menu. We came in 5:15pm more than enough time to get happy hour food. I ordered a Jamaican with extra rum. I paid $5.75 it use to come in a glass on the side....I feel he could of asked do I want it on the side...something he needs to practice....the drink did not taste like it had extra....other than that I still like Blue 32....even tho Ashley P. isn't here...."}
{"text":"Best ribs in town! They are tender, KC style, slow cooked and soooo yummy! My husband and I can share the full rack. It comes with homemade baked beans. I think they add \"blue\" cheese to everything...cole slaw included, for a unique twist on the usual pub grub. It seems everything is freshly made and consistent.  The salmon salad is perfect on a hot summer night.  The salmon is slightly sweet and crispy, the greens, fresh and lightly dressed.  Try the mashed potatoes with anything! They're divine. I've never made it to dessert, so someone else will have to do that review...better yet, I may have to \"take one for the team\" next visit. The service is friendly and prompt, never rushed. I love that many of the servers recognize us and remember our \"usual\". We keep going back as much for this as the food. Thanks, Blue, keep it coming, and put your chef hat on for maybe a few new selections for us to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food but be aware that though place closes at 11 they shut the kitchen at 10:20. Told us we could hurry up and order something and call the other couple meeting us to order for them."}
{"text":"Great food!! Spinach artichoke dip appetizer is delicious...even the bread they give you to dip has a great flavor.  Nachos are good too (huge!).  Buffalo chicken wrap was great...loaded with buffalo chicken and quality blue cheese dressing.  Philly steak salad was good (also huge).  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great family friendly restaurant! At first I thought it would be the typical sports bar food, but house wine and fish tacos were very good. My kids love going too with so many TV's they were in heaven."}
{"text":"Came here after going to a movie. Great sports bar and restaurant the food is great, lots of beer on tap and everything is pretty reasonably priced. The have lots of great dinner options and a great mix of bar food.Service was great. I had the carne asada and it was amazing.  As far as sports go it a great place to catch just about any game they have a ton of big screens and just about every seat is a good seat to watch from.  All in all we had a great first experience at Blue 32 and we will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We met our gang of 6 for HH and enjoyed great food, and great service.  Our waitress, Kelly, was terrific.  We wanted to sit outside and asked if we could have two tables put together.  They did it faster than we could move a couple chairs.  When our other couples arrived, they asked her to turn on the misters and fans, which she also did right away.  Our orders were taken promptly and the cold beer and wine never got to the bottom of our glasses since she was always right there, asking would you like another.  Perfect service; great can-do attitude.  The Monte Crisco sandwich was excellent as were several of the HH food items our table mates ordered.  This is the best place to come to bring friends or out of town guests if you do not want to disappoint!  Sit outside or in the remodeled spacious inside."}
{"text":"Love the food and sports atmosphere, but always so cold in the restaurant. Please, please work on this, because we want to come back."}
{"text":"Don't bother using the Nowait app, because we were told that call ins go ahead of the app. \"That's what management told us to do\".  When we arrived we were \"next in line\" 25 min later, after asking we were seated."}
{"text":"Really good, I had the sliders and they were great (tasty, good portion size with fries). My server was friendly and efficient.  Little better tap beer selection would be my only recommendation but understand space may be a constraint."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Best Monte Cristo I have had in AZ. The fries were awesome. Chips and queso were great!  Three thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for the first time.  We had seen it many times while visiting the Fox Cigar Bar but just never stopped.  I have to say that I was very happy with our visit.  We sat in the bar area and got waited on promptly.  We just happen to hit happy hour...BONUS!  I had the hot wings.  They were very good and flavorful.  Not very hot but like I have said in many of my other reviews my tolerance to heat is a little above the bell curve.  My only issue with the wings was that I should have ordered them extra crispy.  They were a little too soft, almost that \"slimy\" texture.  I don't hold that against them, that was my fault.  My wife had the grinder and she absolutely loved it.  We split the wings and the grinder and I have to say that I also really enjoyed it.  She also got the loaded cheese fries.  They were greasy goodness.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The best sports bar in the area by far! The service was friendly and efficient and the food did not take long to prepare at all! The food is spectacular and the spinach and artichoke dip was the best I have ever had! Amazing atmosphere and a true sports grill! I highly recommend it for the family or with the friends!"}
{"text":"I was hoping to make this my go to place as I love bar food and comfort food, exactly what's on the menu. At first, I was very excited about the amount of menu options; however, it seems Blue 32 has endured the same issues as any restaurant offering too many menu items - average food. The food is also overpriced. I've been here twice and sadly I don't think we will be visiting much in the future.   Potato soup - very good Salmon - average Mashed potatoes - very good Fish and chips - greasy and not a lot of flavor and in 2016, I expect fresh cut fries Nachos - decent  Guacamole- flavorless (why is it so thick? weird) Country fried chicken - dry and gravy tastes weird Wings - not good at all. Wings were crispy but they tasted like poor quality meat and the wing sauce sucked. Also the blue cheese was way too thick.  Monti Cristo - worst I've ever had. Lack of flavor. Just not good in lots of ways.  Drinks - good  If it were cheaper, I might consider eating overall average food more frequently but this place is expensive."}
{"text":"This Place is happening. Great place to watch a game or just to kick back with your friend or spouse. Food is consistent and service is fast.  Great location too"}
{"text":"Was there last week and sat at the bar with my wife. Service was excellent...I think our server was Kelsey. Had the blue 32 beef sandwich which was excellent and weighed about 2 pounds. TV's everywhere...nice atmosphere  Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Great food!!!!! But definitely a little over priced. Great if you wanna watch a game or eat with the family."}
{"text":"The kitchen manager personally came out to check on our meal, which was wonderful. The food and atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Worst service ever at Blue 32. The bartender spills a full glass of water on my wife.  It happens. Cell phone and purse saved. We stay, although my wife feels like she is wearing a diaper. I order food and a drink and the same bartender forgets the food order. We finally give up. Guess we'll grab something on the way home. Thanks for nothing. U Blew It 32."}
{"text":"There is nothing about this place that I don't like! The food is soooo good. I ordered the chicken enchilada soup to start with which was very good. I also ordered the nachos (with chicken instead of ground beef) and it was fantastic!  My husband ordered the chicken tenders and fries. Even the honey mustard was good. The music was on point. TV's are visible from anywhere you sit. Our server was attentive and friendly even when it was real busy. I read the happy hour menu and prices and can't wait to come back in during those times."}
{"text":"i will never waste my time coming here again!! Because my team was ahead and it was 4th quarter they changed the station to another game !!!  Beyond pissed off !!! Never again"}
{"text":"I've found this to be the best sportsbar in the Gilbert/chandler area.  Their burgers are damn good and cooked to the temp that you order them.  The TV's are plenty and they have a good sound system which is great provided what they are focused on is what you are watching.  The service at the bar is always excellent but I cannot comment about the table service.  The bar is big and when full, the tenders always seem to be able to keep up.  The brew selection is good but not great however they do support local which is always a plus.  The place is cleaner than most sports bars and lacks that grimy feel you get at other spots.  Parking sucks for sure due to being in a small lot with several other busy places.  Be prepared to hunt through the odd shaped lots that seem poorly planned.  Overall a solid 4star bar."}
{"text":"I eat here very often, I enjoy the atmosphere, they always have several sporting events on to choose from and the food, the food at this sports bar, it is awesome!  I have not had anything there I do not like, my favorite (although I do not alow myself to order it to often) is the Monte Cristo sandwich.  It is amazing, I am also very suprised at how many people I take there that have never had a Monte Cristo, if you have not had one, pony up and go get one, it sounds weird maybe even gross.... but just do it.... you can trust me... I am a faceless voice speaking to you from the all knowing internet.... The onion rings there are also really good, they have a very nice spicy heat to them (I recommend a side of ranch dressing).    Their happy hour menue is very good, many affordable things to order that are very tasty.  Also as a past bar tender myself I have been very pleased with the martinis and mixed drinks that they serve (and no one is more critical than a bar tender), I am slightly embarrassed to admit that their frozen margaritas (I know, I know, I did drink a frozen margarita) are really really good.  The only gripe I have had with them is that the last couple of times I have tried to order a beer that they have been out of what I want.  This is not a Sports Grill you go to for crappy food and good beer, I'd say it's a \"Sports Grill\" you go to for good food and crappy beer!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad thing to eat here.  Oh, I take that back. Over the years, things can't be perfect but on that rare occasion that something wasn't right or didn't live up to our expectation, apologies were made and the issue corrected.   Tonight, I had the pastrami sliders and a caesar salad..  the pastrami was fjantastic, not at all fatty. I was served 4 sandwiches which was a surprise based on the price and past experiences. I had only expected 3.   Glad we stopped in again and I know we'll be back again."}
{"text":"Just to punish myself, I returned and ordered another burger at the Scottsdale Road location.  The Swiss and Mushroom burger was just as blah as the first one.  There is nothing special about the meat, and the temperature was wrong on all three of the burgers my party ordered.  Service was great.  Very noisy.  Appetizers were good.  I am just surprised this place can do a decent hamburger."}
{"text":"Sports Bars can be tricky, depending on events on TV and time of day you are in them can make all the difference in the world how your experience can turn out.   The food is typical bar food, the service was just okay (nothing over the top good or bad) and the ambiance was loud (which is to be expected in a sports bar.) Food wise the Nachos were tasty and the Spinach Artichoke Dip is pretty good. Don't get the Loaded Fries ours were soggy and kinda bland.   The restaurant is clean, the hostess was nice, the waitress was okay and the food was okay. So yeah, I would say this place is/was a-okay."}
{"text":"First time eating at this location.   Actually was able to get as slow time on a Saturday.   Table had sliders and buff chicken sandwich.   Both were really good.     The service was iffy at best especially considering how slow it was.   Wait staff would disappear to the bar area for extended periods of time.   When it is slow I'd expect the staff to be on the top of their game.   Your beverage glass should never go empty for an extended period of time"}
{"text":"I went in on a Friday during lent and ordered the fish and chips since I don't eat meat on Fridays during lent. The fish and chips comes with cole slaw.  So I take some bites of my fish, it's good. I take some bites of my cole slaw. It's good, but there are little dark specks in my cole slaw that taste like some sort of meat or bacon.  Apparently, they put bacon in their coleslaw! Nowhere on the menu does it say they put bacon in their coleslaw! Who puts bacon in coleslaw, that goes with fish? Super annoying. Did I mention I don't eat meat on Fridays? Bacon is meat."}
{"text":"The Black and Blue 32 burger was pretty good. Wife had the Monte Cristo and it was really good. Servers were very cordial. We sat outside under the misters and it was quite pleasant. We will definitely be back at some point."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for dinner and drinks. The last two times we ate here within 2 weeks a friend found a hair in his chicken sandwich told the waiter had another one made for him he couldn't eat after that took it home. Thought we go back Saturday have a late dinner and drinks. Well we noticed the fries seemed like they were sitting out a long while and they just through them back in the fryer and served them. Well my friend was sitting across from I noticed the longest hair cooked on his fry told the waitress asked if she wanted us to remake them we asked for the check manager came over said he was going to take care of the food. Well of course we just had one bit and sent our plates  back. We had one drink each the least the manger could of said was he would take care of my friends meal and drink after explaining to him we were just there Monday and the same thing happened. We won't be going back here."}
{"text":"My husband and I went out for a date night and we picked something new... And Blue 32 was it! We went in and the place was clean and the wait time was only a few minutes! Our waitress was great and our food was amazing!   Thank you for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Staff always kind and on the ball even when busy.  Probably the best bar and grill I've ever been too. The food no matter if it's Ahi tuna or fried pickles, the food is consistently GREAT. The fastest I've ever received food in a restaurant is this place and they have never failed at that. Consistency is key to a successful business and they have nailed that."}
{"text":"Tasty food, good service, and plenty of TVs to watch the game. I'll be back to watch more sports in the bar area, but I wouldn't come just for dinner."}
{"text":"Save your money and go somewhere else.  This place is so gross, the food is bleh and the service sucks.  I just don't understand how this place has gotten as popular as it is...how can you mess up a burger?  Seriously? Or chicken wings?  Poor quality ingredients and seriously overpriced. Save your money and the stomach ache."}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered has been delicous, The ribs are some of the best Ive had."}
{"text":"My husband is an excellent cook, so when we go out to eat we can be hard to plase,  but we really enjoyed the food. The shrimp poboy was excellent. Shrimp were fresh. The batter on the shrimp,  and the sauce had just enough spice."}
{"text":"Good food and service. This may be my new spot to come and watch games so I don't have to drive all the way to northern Chandler or Mesa to find a place that has my game on."}
{"text":"my first time here at blue 32 was great. i came for happy hour I had the chicken wings and a chambord margarita both are fantastic! service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and it does not disappoint.  Staff are well trained and very friendly.  We are greeted/acknowledged as soon as we arrive whether it is busy or not.  Our beverages never see an empty glass and waiters and waitresss always check in periodically to see if we needed anything else.  There lunch menu; soup, salad and 1/2 a sandwich very generous.  Fish and Chips with their specialty bacon and blue cheese coleslaw and nice surprise from regular coleslaw.  I have also had their salmon lunch, though lots of burgers to choose from I really enjoy their simple Old Fashion Burger."}
{"text":"Food quality isn't that impressive and to be quite honest, I don't believe the quality is any better then a Denny's. Service wasn't that great either, the girl was very nice, however, there were times where we were left waiting for longer than usual."}
{"text":"Minus the TVs which are great for watching sports, the food almost killed me! It's disgusting I never complain but when I ordered the chicken  avacado sandwich other night it tasted and smelt rank like rotten meat, it was dry like it was freezer burnt that was left out open and then spoiled then cooked...ugg..Then I ordered wine it was so rotten I spit it back in glass ... Yep I'm not ever going back there again.."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants close to home. Service is always great, food is always exceptionally good. The past few times we have gone we have ordered the chips and queso dip, and the queso dip has been cold, but they always correct our order. Expect a 20+ minute wait during dinner hours. Worth the wait every time, for us anyway :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely a place you want to be if you are trying to watch the game. They have a great list of draft beers and their food is quite exquisite. I got the bud light and my girlfriend got angry orchard as well as the mimosa. She said the mimosa was quite nice as it came with a strawberry. We ordered the trio dip; it came with guacamole, queso dip and salsa. The queso dip and salsa were quite good but the guacamole needed a little more seasoning. We also ordered the quesdilla; it was excellent and it was very cheesy which was good in my eyes. The service was really good as the waitress was always on top of everything and made sure everything was ok."}
{"text":"The Black and Blue 32 Burger is by far my favorite burger around.  Staff is attentive; prices are fair.  Overall, a great place to go."}
{"text":"The Blue 32 in Chandler has the best pastrami sandwich I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Everything this is great here except for the Philly Cheesesteak. Nice owners, great atmosphere for games, patio seating & excellent service."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried has been good, even the broccoli.  My wife had the salmon today, we are kind of snobs when it comes to fish and this passed the test.  My friend loves the black and blue coleslaw.    I wish there were some bigger personalities on the staff but they are all nice and helpful."}
{"text":"NICE sports bar!  There were lots of tv's for your viewing pleasure.  I had the Greek salad with chicken and my companion had the southwest salad.  Both were bountiful and the chicken was nice and tender!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  We had an awesome server, Brandon.  He was really efficient and made great recommendations!  The food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Lots of choice - I have not ordered anything that was not great. Ton of tvs - great place for football."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this week. Had a great steak sandwich. We had quick service and the food was perfect and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We totally love this place! Our only complaint is that it's so popular it's always packed.  Ultimately that's a good thing though, and says a lot about the business.  If you sit at the bar, the bartenders are awesome.  If you get a table, their servers are awesome.  Their drinks are strong and reasonably priced even if they're not on happy hour.  My girlfriend is low carb and asked about customizing a steak entree to include broccoli and shrimp instead of what was included on the menu.  They totally hooked it up for her without even batting an eye.  THE SHRIMP WAS SO GOOD, too!  It's a fun place to take in a game (or two).  They also offer a cool option where you can do call-ahead seating if there's a wait, or they can text you when your table is ready.  You can even text back if your plans change, which is so convenient.   Keep it up, Blue!"}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed with this place was something out of the ordinary fools decent service I guess was too many people at one table so they had to straddle as much as they possibly could had to remind them a lot about things that we need it for the table they made sure the drinks were there but the food was just a little lacklustre wouldn't recommend this unless you were sports fan and you really just going there to drink food of substandard"}
{"text":"CHAD did a great job tonight!!  Best service EVER!! He was attentive and extremely friendly!!  The last time I came the service was HORRIBLE!!  The manager offered to get us an appetizer then our food appeared so she just left it at that..  The hostess was why I couldn't give 5 stars"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and I'd say the food is quite good.  I've only been for Sunday football, and have had no issues with quick, friendly service.  Wings are excellent, and their carne asada tacos are great too.  I need to have a burger there, but am confident it will be above average.  They also have a nice setup for Sunday football, and provide a map of all of the TV's, along with the lineup of which games are on what screens, so you can scout out the best seat for the games you want to watch."}
{"text":"The fries are memorable. Seriously, it bugs me when a place screws up fries. Blue 32 exceeds expectations on how the fries are seasoned.   The outside is nice, by the fireplace, it is warm and fulfilling during the chillier parts of the year in Phoenix. Cold beer, warm fries, hot fireplace, good company, and you end up having a good time.  I also dig the burgers they serve here. The black and blue is an all time favorite that I come back to, time and time again, whenever I come here.  As far as service goes, it was good and they were well attentive to our party's needs. It was worth the 20%+ in tip given to the server.  Would return."}
{"text":"I have experienced better at this Blue 32 until this past week. We ordered the spinach dip like we always do and there was 1/2 the bread served with it. We ordered the shrimp tacos like we always do and there was half the shrimp with the tacos. Funny...the price wasn't half."}
{"text":"First time here and it will definitely not be my last time. My friend and I came here to watch the Saints and Niners game. Its seat yourself,  but we wanted to sit at the bar. The bar is very nice with an excellent selection of drinks and beers on tap. The atmosphere is light and relaxing. It had a pleasant and mixed crowd.  The staff were friendly and attentive. They also would engage a friendly and spirited discussion about the pros and cons of the teams playing.  I had their seasonal which was a 4 Peaks Pumpkin porter. My friend had the Kilt Lifter. The glasses came in nice and frozen mugs every time.  The bartender Chelsea was very friendly,  fun,  and johnny on the spot with refills. She did a spectacular job! It was a full bar and most of the table areas were full. She was constantly working and made it fun to ve there.  As did the rest of the staff.  I had the Hot Texas Burger and fries which was fantastic. Very well done and just tasty. I love jalape√±os and bacon  a burger. My friend had the bacon cheese burger. Which he said was delicious.   The mens restroom was very clean and nice. Which is always a pleasant surprise whenever I am at a sports bar/restaurant.   Even though it was a heck of a drive it wad well worth the trip. Drinks and were a bit more then I normally pay for,  but the quality of the drinks, food, and staff were second to none. Also there is free wifi as well."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see that this was opening by the Harkins.  We've been to the Scottsdale location several times.  This place is great inside - a sports lovers place to hang out. Lots of tv's and great food.  The only issue - the wait staff is YOUNG.  We had to keep asking for our server.  We looked around for a manager type and there was none to be seen - or one that was walking around checking on the customers.  One of the waitresses was awesome - she kept circulating the tables."}
{"text":"Tacos al Carbon, Sliders, Steak Sandwich, Onion rings, fires, salsa, queso. ALL the yums!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner. If you love sports this place has plenty of big screens. Try the spinach queso dip. Delicious have to have it. Nice fire pit too."}
{"text":"My husband and I sat at the bar and had a few drinks. The bartender was friendly and attentive.  $10.50 for an old fashioned is a bit much for a sports bar.  It's a good little local joint to bring the fam and have decent grub."}
{"text":"We just tried this for the first time and will definitely be back. The baked potato soup and chicken club salad were both delicious. Prices are good and we're excited to have a neighborhood bar and grill that is family friendly!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday and feel a bit iffy about the experience. We were seated immediately with our toddler and waited for quite awhile for drink service. Our server seemed stretched across many tables. We got our drinks after about 15 minutes and then ordered queso, a salad and a cheesesteak. The waiter started to leave without asking if/what we wanted for our son, even though we were looking at the kids menu they gave us.   After 25 minutes or so, our drinks were empty and we still hadn't received our queso app. My goat cheese salad, son's sliders and sweet potato fries and hubby's Philly came out and were all very good. The slider meat, in particular was very fresh and tasty. We told the runner who brought our food to ensure that our waiter knew not to bring out the delayed queso. No apology or offer to alleviate the botched order from her or our waiter. We eventually got drink refills and told our waiter about the queso. His reply...\"oh, I probably forgot to place that order.\" (laughing) Again, no apology or attempt to correct his mistake. Not a good first experience with customer service. The food we did get, however, was very good and we would be willing to go back and try more with a different server. This would be a great atmosphere for watching a game."}
{"text":"My husband and I order food to go a lot from Blue 32. Whenever I've gone in to get our food, everyone is very friendly and always checks to make sure I've been helped. They are very courteous on the phone even when they are extremely busy. We've eaten in the restaurant a few times and had a great experience each time. Great service and great food! Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"First time in and it won't be our last!  Natalie was our server and she was phenomenal.  Burgers were excellent, prices are fair, and food came out relatively fast for how packed it was.  Saw a bartender with a Vikings jersey on so that was also a plus ;)"}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!!! It smells sour, the place is so family oriented, if you are remotely enthusiastic they yell at you #dontcallyourselvesasportsbarthen speaking of, a rude  Indian (middle eastern) woman grabbed my arm after her husband classlessly addressed my husband about him being loud at the bar during playoff baseball and the server said MY HUSBAND was being disruptive, um...how about the trash that grabbed my arm????????? That's disruptive not to mention a bad example for her son, but whatever you can't teach class TO TRASH!!!!!!! NEVER going back. I'll spend all my money next door at the best place ever.... ISABELS!!!! FU Blue 32!!!!!"}
{"text":"Alicia was our server and she was awesome! Food was the best we have had in Chandler, Az"}
{"text":"The service is not very good. The Bartender was rude. It is very high priced for a Sports Bar."}
{"text":"With 2 kids we waited about 40 minutes for our food, food came A little cold which means it was sitting for a little bit too.  Still gave 3 stars since the food is good.  They were really busy and did a great job at seating us faster than promised."}
{"text":"My favorite place for weekend hang out with my friends, specially it very close to my house and my buddies, the drinks weren't too expensive. The only sport bar around here, it seem liked no choice, but it wasn't bad either! I love this place and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Blue 32 a few times now.  Both locations are clean and have plenty of TV's at every possible viewing angle.  Our service was fast and Megan was very nice and attentive.  My chicken, bacon and avocado sandwich was particularly tasty.  I've also had the salads and they are always fresh and plentiful.  Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"I like Blue 32.  I've never had a bad experience with the food or with the service.  I wouldn't say that either are stellar but they are good, for sure.  My husband and I really enjoy their burgers, wings and they have this potato soup that is pretty delicious.  I haven't had much more that these and beer, so it's hard for me to review the food.    I don't recommend going late, if you're hungry.  They don't serve full menu after a certain time on Friday's and Saturday's but do serve nachos (not very good at all) and liqour.  The service has always been good, even during busy game times."}
{"text":"Great food, good drinks, friendly staff, and a great view of the games from every seat!"}
{"text":"Very good, food was Delish service was fast. The prices at happy hour were very reasonable. The only issue I had was the bathroom wasn't very clean. But overall excellent experience. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I went with a few friends to Blue 32 and was surprised at the great quality of food and selection.  Their happy hour menu was pretty good. I got the buffalo shrimp and onion rings.  Let me tell you - the onion rings were freshly battered and thick onions.  One of the best I have ever had.  My girlfriends had a good time trying new drinks with their lengthy selection.  I am a fan - and want to go back!  I can especially rationalize it since it is right next to a movie theater."}
{"text":"Great food! Grinder is one of my favorites. Friendly employees are always helpful. Great location next to the move theater. They alo open in time for all the college and NFL games on the weekends."}
{"text":"I really expected crappy food, because, after all, that's what sports bars generally offer.  Then I was told that the food was not bad, but good!  Which only made me eye my table mates suspiciously.  I ordered the tacos al carbon which comes with cilantro lime rice.  these are three street taco sized dealies that have steak in them and come with a little shot of pico and queso.  Now like I said, I expected crap.  But the tacos, with pico and queso poured on them, and grease dribbling out into a glorious puddle on the plate, were really amazingly good.  The steak bits were really tender--ordinarily in such a taco they'd be the tenderness of jerky.  Really: the tacos were totally sensational.  Also, we ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread which is essentially a pizza.  And it was great!  even with the bleu cheese, which I detest, this was a culinary delight.  So why the four stars, you ask?  two reasons.  One: the cilantro lime rice is offensively bad, like straight out of a box of rice-a-roni bad.  I would have preferred kibbles and bits as a side item.  And one other thing: it was happy hour and for a while they were serving beer OUT OF PITCHERS THAT WERE IN THE REFRIGERATOR INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TAP!  Capital crime.  Felonious.  In fact, Dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap.  So you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and I'd never look back, I didn't drink beer tonight and so I really don't care if my table mates suffer.  But if you try that shit on me...  Four stars.  The food is really damn good."}
{"text":"I recently had lunch on my birthday at Blue 32.  The food and service was exceptional!  We had a large group of people and everyone at the table raved about their food.  I had the tacos al carbon and they were awesome!  This was my 3rd or 4th visit to Blue 32 and I can't wait for the Scottsdale location to open next month."}
{"text":"Limited beer options and a fast food quality menu.  I left disappointed and don't plan to return."}
{"text":"5 stars for the hospitality alone. 2 more for the quick service, friendly ppl, $2 Shiner Bock, and for making me feel at home. Gotta bring the wife next time. She might actually approve."}
{"text":"Got very very sick after eating here. Called manager and demanded refund. Said she would do so. Never happened. NEVER WILL GO AGAIN."}
{"text":"Ok, first things first.  The food:  is great.  I had a philly cheesesteak which was one of the best I've had in the valley.  There are lots of flat screen tvs and the staff are not only courteous and nice but not bad to look at either.  My only complaint:  $5.50 for a shiner bock beer.  Where I come from that is highway robbery.  Now that didn't stop me from putting down a half dozen but lets be clear:  If you are looking to get your drink and it's not happy hour this is probably not the place for you.  Unless your wealthy.   The only I appreciate more than good food is cheap beer.  It just makes it that much colder and smoother.  So, I like the place and will go back but only during happy hour."}
{"text":"Always good food and service at this Blue 32.  Very large portion sizes as well.  If you haven't tried the chicken fried steak, it's a must.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good draft selection. Their burgers are very good my favorite is their home made boneless wings. They would just melt in your mouth. I tried their Philly salad but it was ok. More on the greasy side"}
{"text":"The saturday evening crowd made this place hopping but we were able to find a high-top... we wanted to eat healthier (normally hard at a sports grill) and found the Ahi dish and the Grilled Shrimp dishes amazing.  Would recommend it to others and definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant hands down. Whomever put this menu together was genius. The flavors in the food and mixture of ingredients is perfect. Not your average sports bar...DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is getting bad. 2nd consecutive time we got seated then waited for server, yhis time we left before the server got to the table .  Server too busy socializing with other servers.  I told manger, his final comment was \"good bye\"."}
{"text":"I've been to this location about 10 times now so far, and every time I go home happy :)  The service is great; Erin and Darren are fantastic. The food comes out hot, and the drinks are always ice cold.  Definitely try the fries, wings or ribeye. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We love to eat here when there's a game we want to watch. The service is great. Blue 32 has a menu that my wife and I both enjoy. Killer, High Def TVs are everywhere inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Extremely busy on Friday and Saturday nights.  Hard to find seating.  Nice beer selection and the burgers were good.  Pricing was ok for the quality of the food.  It was fairly noisy for conversation.  Good views of the TV's to catch a game.  Definitely worth checking out.  Service was good especially for as busy as they were."}
{"text":"Friends and I showed up - all 8. Service was fast, friendly. The server had no problem with separate checks. My Blue 32 Burger was terrific. The cole slaw wonderful. And I could watch Boise State play! Wonderful restaurant. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Good service and a wide variety of food.   Tasty margarita. Food was ok. Portions are generous."}
{"text":"The ribs are awesome.  Servers are great and we will definitely be back.  Beer is extra cold too."}
{"text":"Blue 32 is our definite go-to sports bar AND restaurant - I cannot believe I have not written a review yet!  The service is most often top notch (we've had a few misses, but that can happen anywhere).  No matter where you are sitting, you can see a TV (or 8) easily.  The food gives you cravings that keep you coming back.  Our favorite foods here: Country fried chicken. My fiance is from Kentucky and his mother and grandmother were executive chefs. He knows good fried chicken and raves about it here (it's almost better than his). Portion is so large, we often split (along with an appetizer).  Boneless buffalo wings, hot. We get these literally every time we come. The breading is amazing. Sauce is perfect. Not a better way to start a meal at a sports bar. :)  Carne asada dinner. It may not be quite 5 stars, but it's a good 4-4.5 stars every time we have it.  Southwest Chicken Salad.  I would suggest asking for it with romaine. I don't know why they don't just change the menu so it is standard, but you can't win them all, I suppose.  Burgers. 4 stars. Not perfect, but a good staple. We've had a few of them and have always been happy."}
{"text":"The location on Val Vista & Williams Field was our go to sports bar and restaurant for a while - this location is just as great and slightly closer to home. TONS of TVs - great spot to watch a game. The food is the type that you would expect in a sports bar, but the quality is so much higher. Really love pretty much everything we get here.  Our favorite menu items: Boneless wings hot Spinach and artichoke dip (SOOOOO good!) Southwestern salad (ask for romaine instead of the iceburg) Country fried chicken Carne asada Salmon Monte carlo sandwich  Now I am hungry and want to go back right this minute!!"}
{"text":"My husband, my parents and I went to dinner here on a Thursday night. There was a wait but we found a table at the bar. James was the best server ever. He made sure our drinks were always full and our picky food orders that we gave him came out perfect. The food was delicious!! I highly recommend Blue 32!! Great experience!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite sports bar...friendly service and good food.  Give the buffalo chicken wrap a try with rings of course, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"When I think about Blue 32 I think of 2 things:  the baked potato soup and the hot pastrami sandwich.  Both are so good they make me blaspheme.  With all caps and a bunch of exclamation points.  If you have nothing else here but those two items, you will have had a fantastic meal.  BUT, they have some other delicious items on the menu like the applewood BLT and the onion rings.  I can't believe we had not tried the onion rings at one of their other locations, but we had them on our first visit to this location and they were excellent.    We were here for the first time about a week and a half ago.  Great food.  Great beer (Guinness and Papago orange blossom ale).  And also great service.  I don't have a name on my receipt other than AM Bar for the morning of Sept. 23rd, but the young man taking care of us did a great job.  He was very knowledgeable and had a great sense of humor.    Ooh.  Right now I'm thinking about more of that baked potato soup.  Might as well go back and get a pastrami sandwich while I'm at it."}
{"text":"I've eaten at both the Gilbert and Chandler locations, and my family is glad they opened the Chandler one as it's a quality establishment. Service is very friendly and attentive. We started with a delicious bruschetta. For my entree, I had the grilled salmon and cilantro rice and broccoli, and it was absolutely delicious. The place is hopping and for good reason - the good food keeps bringing people back."}
{"text":"Great food, Philly sandwich had great grilled taste. Not too noisy as most sports bars are, you could have a conversation. Happy hour was limited but everyone enjoyed the regular menu and all the food was good (taste and value). Service was above avg for sports bar....Thanks, will be back soon."}
{"text":"The place turned out really nice. Staff was great, food was great, and not a bad seat in the house to see a tv. Check it out when you have a chance."}
{"text":"First time here.Food is very good. Service is good, definitely will be back. I had the pulled bbq pork sandwich very good, husband had fish and chips and loved it."}
{"text":"By 5-stars I mean as good as it gets for bar food.  They really do an excellent job here.  Since my last review we've been back a couple of times and continue to have outstanding service and have tried the kobe dog and the grinder.  Everything was great except for one item.  The only complaint I have is they need to get better hot dog buns.  They used the same bun for the dog and for the grinder and it was dried out and way too big for the dog.  It reminded me of those cheap school lunch buns that taste like sugar and stick to the roof of your mouth.  We were able to pick out the innards though and really enjoyed that.  Forget the bun.  It would be much better with fresh bread like Jimmy John's or Flancer's uses."}
{"text":"Mr. M and I were driving around aimlessly last Sunday and with the cloudy weather I was craving soup.  We knew there was a Blue 32 somewhere in this area and I then started thinking about their baked potato soup.  Oh yeah!   That's what I want.  This is a nice newer location tucked back off Higley in a strip mall, and right away we were greeted by the hostess and seated in a booth along the side wall.  TVs everywhere!  It was easy to keep up with whatever sports action was going on at the time.  On that note, can we just get to baseball season...please!  We started with the calamari app and I had a pint of Papago Orange Blossom Ale and he had a pint of Sam Adams winter lager.  Both are beers we are well familiar with and they went well with the calamari.  The calamari were fried nice and light with a good dipping sauce on the side, but the breading had way too much black pepper for our taste.  Smart on their part because that will make people drink more beer.  We ate it, but I would not order it again.  Then came my bowl of baked potato soup which was just as good as I remember from having it at the other Gilbert location.  I aspire to make soup this good.    Mr. M tried the pastrami sliders and those were really delicious!  Flavorful, tender pastrami, melty cheese, fresh pickles, toasted buns, AND you get 4 instead of 3 like most places.  Now we have a couple of new addictions at Blue 32.  The soup, those sliders, and orange blossom ale.  Could it get any better?  Yum!    With the food I mentioned plus another pint of orange blossom ale to share, the total was $37.77 before tax and tip.  Lexi was our server and she took great care of us.  Can we have a Blue 32 over here in south Chandler please???"}
{"text":"Like the food and atmosphere.  I hate the fact the hostess that puts us on the list is more entertained with texting and talking with the other hostess, than actually helper my people get a table.   Called ahead today, and that didn't work, as we sit here waiting there is 3 booths and 2 tables cleaned and open.   Not the 1st time."}
{"text":"We went to lunch here yesterday, after seeing a movie at the Harkins next door.   There was a 30 minute long wait to be seated, but we didn't mind.  We like to try new places and we figured we might as well cross this place off of our list. while we were in the area   Once we were seated, we quickly looked over the menu and decided to order our food and drinks all at once to avoid too much of a wait (since the place as busy). My husband ordered the Philly Cheesesteak (sandwich) and a Kilt Lifter and I got the Patty Melt and an ice water. As our sides, we both opted to upgrade our fries and get the 'loaded' fries for an extra $1.   Overall the food was pretty good.  My husband enjoyed his sandwich and we both very much so enjoyed the loaded french fries!  My patty melt was a bit on the salty side, but it was still pretty tasty otherwise.  As far as ambiance goes, the place was a bit loud, but that was to be expected given that the Broncos vs. Ravens playoff game was on. We will definitely be back as it is definitely a nice alternative to the neighboring fast food chains in the area."}
{"text":"Very loud and busy on a Friday night.  Recently moved to the area.  We liked the Blue 32 when it was in Scottsdale but it closed down.  Chandler is a better spot.  We had happy hour nachos, house salad and a BLT.  Though the nachos were a repeat from Scottsdale with white cheese, the best.  Yum. No not healthy.  My husband also had a BLT.  He subbed a house salad for $2.79.  This was for me.  Nothing to write home about but typical for a Sports bar.  The BLT was very good with thick bacon slices. Good selection on beers also."}
{"text":"The Stanford Cardinal Viewing party was held on the patio tonight. A BEAUTIFUL Friday evening made for a PERFECT start to the 2016 football season.  Checkout the drinks, appetizers, full dinner menu and multiple TV screens for a FUN way to entertain family, friends and business associates.   The Blue 32 Sports Grill is a terrific choice to host  your next group outing. The service is attentive, the food delicious, all served under the magnificent Arizona starlit night time sky."}
{"text":"I like Blue32.  More importantly, my 5 year old likes Blue32.  For the little ones, the steak bites are a good option.  For the bigger ones, I like their Monte Cristo.  It's one of the better Monte Cristos that I've had.  I also like their chessesteak sandwich.  Be sure to ask for this with jalapenos for an extra kick.  Also of note is the spinach artichoke dip, which is mostly cheese with some spinach and artichoke in it, but that's probably why I like it.  People who've had the burgers say they're very good.  Be forewarned, on days when the Cards are playing, getting a table can be a challenge."}
{"text":"Consistent food and service every time! They have an excellent selection for happy hour and for a large menu they seriously are good at serving good food regardless of the day or time of day."}
{"text":"We have done take-out about 10 times and we are pretty picky. What surprised me was both the quality and quickness. Burgers are consistently great as are fries. The Monte Christo is the best I have ever had. Mahi tacos are excellent as is the potato soup. Also, take-out is accurate and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband loves to stop by the Blue 32 for a BLT.  He says they have great bacon.  We have not been to this location before but the bacon is the same. I had the chicken tortilla soup.  It tasted bland with flour or corn starch thickener.  I am sure he will want another BLT soon. Plus we thought the fries were very good and the service friendly."}
{"text":"My family went for dinner to watch the ASU/UofA basketball game and even called earlier in the day to make sure it was on. We were extremely disappointed they only had select TVs that had the game, couldn't change the TV to put the game on for us and we were seated in front of the only TV that had a bad picture. Server was extremely rude and we left to watch he game at another bar that understood what the local customers wanted."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar area and our server was on top of us asking to take our order before we even opened the menus.  Drinks were brought promptly and food was as well but only tasted okay. We ordered burgers and they were well done. The onion ring batter had zero flavor but the fries were great. I think our biggest complaint was the noise level. The music was so loud you practically had to shout to hear each other. I think the server was a little over eager as she stopped by our table no less than 6 times to ask how things were...the first time before we had even taken a bite."}
{"text":"Our first time at Blue 32...it's AMAZING!!!  Our server, Justin, is fantastic!!!  He guided us through the yummy menu. I highly recommend the Ahi appetizer and the blackened salmon...also their wings are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about Blue 32!  From the moment you walk in the door you feel welcome by the friendly hostess.  Once seated, there are an abundance of TVs with various games on, enough to make everyone happy!  The food and service are both excellent.  We have been here dozens of times, and we have never had a bad meal, and we have tried almost everything!  You can't go wrong if you choose Blue 32."}
{"text":"Fabulous service and fantastic food.  Ribs are as good as Houston's. Monica and Garrett where phenomenal. Knowledgeable, efficient, personable...winning combo!!"}
{"text":"Apparently this is the place to be on a Friday night in Gilbert because it was packed by 6:00pm. To my surprise, that didn't affect the service; our waitress was friendly, attentive and ready to serve! The service is 5 star, but the food we ordered was 3.75 stars.  We had a dz wings (honey hot grilled) that probably wouldve been better if we opted for the non grilled version. The grilled version was dry and OVER charred. In addition, the wings are on the smaller size. I'm used to ATL wings in Chandler... On the bright side, we liked the calamari we ordered and noticed all the food at other tables looked VERY appetizing! Will I return? YES! A place that crowded can't be doing everything mediocre."}
{"text":"Went to the North Scottsdale Blue 32 because it's National Monte Cristo Day, and I know they have a Monte Cristo on the menu.  Weird evening - Thursday night football, so expected to see the game, but holy cow did they ever have the sound turned up!  Waaaaaay too loud.    We chose to sit outside (where it was only too loud).  We put in our Monte Cristo orders, and, while waiting, noticed something going on just off the patio - a couple of employees and a mall security guy are searching around the bushes in the gravel just off the patio.  Next thing we know, the lady at the table next to us is standing on her chair, and their whole table is pointing at a small (~ 1 foot long) snake that's crawling across the patio.  The manager (?) comes over with a stick and a pot and says, \"No, that's a different one...\" then picks up the snake and takes it somewhere away from the restaurant.  A few minutes later, they're all back to looking at the first location until they find the other snake.  That was a first for a dining experience, but hey...we live in the desert - no big deal.  Getting to the important part - the Monte Cristo - I've had the Monte Cristo at the Scottsdale-South location before, and either my memory is going, or it was a fair bit better than this one.  This was ok, but nothing to convert someone who's not already a fan of the Monte Cristo.  Fries were kind of meh, too.  So, if you're looking for a really loud place to watch football, eat average Monte Cristos, and maybe watch some snake wrangling, then maybe this Blue 32 is for you?  :-)"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on 7/19/2017. Walked in and instantly noticed a foul mildew like smell. The further we walked into the restaurant, the stronger the smell. We sat down and started looking at the menu. But the smell overpowered us. We got up and left. Whatever the smell is, no restaurant should ever smell that bad.  Used to enjoy this place quite a bit, but I refuse to eat in filth"}
{"text":"My first review was done after my first visit, and shortly after they opened. Since then I've been to Blue 32 many times and it has truly grown on me, becoming one of my favorite places. The food is really good - especially the boneless wings and the onion rings. They even make their own bleu cheese for the wings - awesome. The beer selection is pretty good and the service is usually very good as well. It's a nice alternative to BWW but not as \"chainy\" and not nearly as loud. I wish the place was a bit closer to my house because I'd be there a lot more often."}
{"text":"I went to Blue 32 with a friend a few weeks and had the worst experience. My friend and I stopped in for a quick bite to eat before we saw a movie. While my friend enjoyed the Deep fried Monte Carlo sandwich, I did not enjoy my quesadilla with bacon and shrimp. The bacon was over whelming and i don't think the shrimp was cook properly. I looked around for our waiter and could not find him. Nor track any other worker down to get something else or have it remade. We even wanted to order more drinks and couldn't. Didn't stop once to see how our meal was. The waiter returned after my friend finished his food. I told him what was wrong with my food. He offered to get me something else but I stated no that we were in a rush now for a movie. He brings us the bill and I was charged for a meal I didn't even barely eat. In fact I got home and spent 4 hours in the bathroom sick as a dog. I wanted to contact the restaurant to tell them that they have horrid service but they dont even have a website or a contact email."}
{"text":"great service great burgers lots of tvs for the sports fun environment dog friendly patio (small but friendly)   worst wings"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the Buffalo chicken salad. Happy hour specials are $3 for edimame and $3 for Queso and chips.Plenty of choices of beer to choose from. Fun atmosphere, wish they had video  poker or trivia for those of us that are not that into every sport.  That would make it a 5 star for me."}
{"text":"Each time we come here we are glad the service continues to be exempilary. The atmosphere is quite and with plenty of visual treats (tv's o plenty). Food  has always been served hot and tasty! The servers are a treat to engage as well."}
{"text":"The food is a little expensive but good. The boneless wings are really good! If you have a chance you should defiantly get them! The burgers are good. I've had poor service however I've also had really good service. Like any other restaurant it depends on when you go. The best time to go is from anytime between 4-9. During this time they are the best servers."}
{"text":"Great service and good food not a bad start for a new venue. Had the turkey Rueben sandwich and the wife had the Cuban. Both were very good made with fresh bread. The fries were better than most places. The menu was varied and had a few unique items. This venue is a sports bar and is on the upscale side of many of the other locals sports bars. Prices are a bit higher than other establishments. However, the bar is clean and the fixtures are clean and neat. It appears that the management adhere to clean stands and don't let things lie around. The staff are all dressed in identical shirts. There are plenty of TV's for the viewing of sporting events.  As I sit here I am watching the bar staff continuously clean the bar area.  This is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurants location in Scottsdale and the one in Gilbert and have absolutely loved their food both times.  Service was great also.  They have so many great things on their menu, I will be back to try many more dishes.  I wasn't very hungry the 2nd time I went and had the Chicken Tortilla soup and ordered loaded fries.  A huge plate of fries came out piled with cheese, green onions, bacon, sour cream.  To die for.  I had so much left over, I took the fries home and the next morning chopped them up, put them on my grill, warmed them up and put some scrambled eggs with them and put them in a tortilla and made fantastic breakfast burritos.  (had no idea if that would work, but they came out really well).  My husband tried one of the pasta dishes and absolute loved it.  We will definitely be back.  Service was good both locations, prices are reasonable for all the food you get."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by this spot. Service was super friendly and the food was plentiful. My husband says the happy hour chips n queso was to die for. My chicken sandwich was very good and I loved my broccoli option as a side (probably need to say \"no butter\" if you're trying to be healthy). They accidentally have me fries but showed up with the correct side quickly. My husband ate my fries and said they were ok - coated which isn't his kind of fry) He liked his hamburger but wasn't overwhelmed enough to crave it. It was so big that it was messy. Messy just isn't our thing."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Sunday night football game and right away noticed the great setup of TVs all around the restaurant which makes for a great spot to watch the game but only to find out the vibe of the sports bar is more of a restaurant than a bar. I think I got more of a Applebee's vibe than a sports bar. Either way the menu was huge and had seriously a little bit of everything which made it hard to narrow down but in the end I went with a buffalo chicken sandwich which was good but I had an appetizer with hot wings which I enjoyed more. Service was a bit slow when it came to drinks but food came out quickly overall an A-Okay spot. Not the best and not the worst."}
{"text":"This used to be Buffalo Wild Wings and they renovated and changed to Blue 32. Our food was just ok nothing amazing. As for the service, it was great when she was around, but that wasn't a lot. They used to have some of the best fried pickles in town but they no longer sell the speared fried pickles"}
{"text":"We sat outside with a group of friends.  The waitress was knowledgeable and handled our group requests without a problem.  Manager even turned the channel to the game we wanted.  The grilled shrimp and the chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries were both really good.  I would rather hang out at this sports bar than some others around town:  clean, good food & drinks, nice staff, and not over crowded."}
{"text":"the pulled pork was a gift from God, the blackened chicken salad was worthy of any resort and the onion rings....wow, a uniques breading and perfect compliment to the sandwich I had. I was working in this part of town, but will definitely be going to the  one closer to me in North Scottsdale. The fries really needed to be hotter (temp) as they are a nice thick cut and seasoned, but that was the only thing keeping this rating from being 5 star. Very attentive but courteous service and all the sports you could focus on and still eat."}
{"text":"Very good food and fast service! I couldn't believe how quickly our food came out regardless of how slammed they were. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. The food was excellent! Sports Grills always freak me out because it's overwhelming to be surrounded by 30 televisions, but I didn't feel like this restaurant was too loud or too intense to just stop by for food and not a game."}
{"text":"Friendly place with good food. Try the grilled shrimp:) Watch out for the happy hour guys they have no social skills...lol"}
{"text":"I'm warming up to this location and am thrilled the food has improved (almost as good as the Williams-Field location). The service has improved too!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and have picked up orders to go on more than one occasion.    Great selection of food and everything I've tried has been top notch - burgers, tacos al carbon, BBQ chicken ranch flatbread, all winners in my book.  The fish and chips are honestly some of the best I've had, and after a mix up one time with my order, this place actually got me to try (and enjoy) blue cheese for the first time. Way to go, Blue 32!  I do wish picking up to go orders didn't involve walking through the whole restaurant to the back and waving to get the attention of a busy bartender, then awkwardly standing there for a few minutes while it's retrieved and rung up.  Great place for lunch or dinner.  Happy it's so close."}
{"text":"Blue 32 proved to be a welcome change to the common sports bar.  I was very impressed with the decor and Menu selection.  I would have given a five star rating, but on this visit the service was a bit out of sorts.  I will be back to try more of the delicious fare."}
{"text":"Wow, what an awesome place.  Big screen TV's everywhere.  We watched baseball, basketball and hockey all at the same time.  Our waiter, Rhett, was great.  Our order was brought out in the proper order, drinks, appetizer, salads and then the main course.  I had an old fashioned burger and my wife had the fish and chips.  The food was hot and tasted great.  The service was just perfect.  A very enjoyable and pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game grab a bite to eat. Staff is so accommodating and so nice! Drinks are done well and the food is always very hot and good.  We like this neighborhood watering hole!"}
{"text":"excellent place overall. food is not the half rate quality you would expect from a sports bar, but instead is a well designed array of delicious dishes. the environment is warm and energetic, and the quantity of tv's for various games can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service and the food is delicious! I love the nachos!! Great place for football Sundays since they have plenty of TV's."}
{"text":"Blue 32 is one of my favorite spots. Try the steak tacos; you won't regret it. I like to get fries instead of the rice."}
{"text":"We had to wait 20 minuets rove seated which was understandable due to us having a group of 7 people. We were seated in 15. We got all of our appetizers within great time and our dinner shortly after. The lemonade is great the food EVEN BETTER ! Ask for Kyle!"}
{"text":"Absolute terrible food prep and zero response from manager. Ordered take-out, one item being loaded fries. The container could not sustain the incredibly heavy weight of the food which also contained ranch dressing supposedly in a sealed side container. Upon opening the container of fries and dressing, the very very very hot food and dressing fell all over me leaving me with burns on my legs. Never realized ordering fries and some ranch dressing was dangerous. I highly suggest investing in containers that can actually hold the weight of the food and that the manager doesn't go into hiding when called and then hang up on you. Blue 32 is one place neither myself, family or friends will ever order from or go to again."}
{"text":"Overall a good restaurant.  We have been here 3 times so far, each time with a good food experience. The first and last time we had good service as well.  You have to be prepared as this is a sports bar, but has a nice family feel. When there are a lot of games on it can get a little loud, but that should be expected!  I would recommend."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and service.  First time coming here and it was fantastic"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after reading all the reviews and checking out their menu. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. It was open and bright and clean. Definitely would be a place I would bring my family to. The menu had lots of variety and I had a hard time chosing.  I opted for the fish tacos, the hubby got the sliders. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food came and the hubby loved the sliders and fries. The fish tacos were good, but nothing spectacular. The cilantro lime rice was very heavy on the lime. Overall the experience was good and I look forward to coming back and trying their ahi, and their flatbread pizza. Im sure ill have as much of a hard time deciding on somethung to try as I did this time."}
{"text":"Food is EXCELLENT especially for a sports bar. Probably one of the best Chicken Fried Chicken dinners I have ever had!   Beer selection is OK, would have loved more local brews to choose from.   Great spot for viewing sports, a lot of great TV's."}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! Very clean! Everyone should stop in. I highly recommend this place! We had the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer (Best). Shared the Chicken Avocado club (Fantastic). And the kids had steak bites and grilled cheese sandwich.  Both kids had a side of strawberries (a large bowl in you). Evenly price and definitely filling. TV ' S everywhere and an extremely clean restroom! MUST visit!"}
{"text":"We have been frequent visitors over the years, tonight wad pretty bad. I had a Blue a Burger ordered medium. I am easy, I will eat rare and well done fit winds up like that. This was raw  did not even need to cut into it. I asked yo have it cooked more  waitress saw it and wax surprised. Wife had fish  and chips  usually pretty hood here. They were way over cooked. I hope it was just a bad night. We were not offered a discount, nor did we ask for one. They acknowledged that it was poor, said they were sorry."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for football games... Have to say I'm really not  Impressed. The food and drinks are over priced... The service Is mediocre at best. I get really frustrated when my bartender asks me if I want another drink and when I say \"yes\" she waits 10 mins and asks me again... She was nice, but remembers nothing. I've never seen a manager on the floor, or even had one \"touch my table.\" One thing that really set me off about this place is the fact they close at 10pm... At 930 i watched the bartender start turning away people that were coming in for drinks... the game wouldnt have even been over by 10pm. I dont understand how a sports bar closes so early...  The best thing about this place is the flatbread pizza... spin dip is a close 2nd."}
{"text":"We stoped in to eat and watch the NCAA championship game. Had amazing service and great food. The reason for 4 out of 5 stars is because the guacamole was way too lemony and the cilantro lime rice was too limey. Other than that, everything was awesome! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and the place turned out to be in sync with their other Scottsdale location.    Service is friendly but a little slow at times, food is.. well... bar food to a certain degree.  Not too special.  I have had their Southwest Salad, Nachos, edamame, wings and a few chili cheese fries.  None were all too impressive.  I was a bit disappointed in their cheese sauce with the nachos as it was very runny and bland.    However, this is a good place to go to if you have a hankering for a beer, sprots and maybe some wings.   This is a lot better option then the previous BW3s that occupied this place.  These guys know how to put together a good sports bar.    Be careful though, this place gets crowded before a movie or during big games."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the food here. They're busy, but we rarely have to wait for a table and the one time we did, the wait was about 15 minutes. The staff is friendly and very responsive."}
{"text":"Stopped by this sports bar to get drink before the movies. I was very disappointed. The staff was nice, but very young and unknowledgable. I specifically requested to sit outside only if they could turn the misters on. I was seated outside and I had to request several times more before they would turn the misters on. It was not crowded, so did not understand the delay. I ordered a very dirty gin martini with 3 olives. The waitress brought back straight gin in martini glass w/three olives. hello.....mc fly!! Then the waitress went MIA. So, I went up to the bar to address the bartender about my drink. The bartendar apologized and said that is what the waitress told her and she thought it was odd. None the less, the bartender remade me the correct drink. I would recommend this place only if you order a beer and be very specific, cause their maybe a different interpretation. Good luck!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's my go to bar, awesome atmosphere, have never disappointed, always treated well, the food is above standards, good crowd, I recommend the Carna Asada."}
{"text":"I was so happy that a Blue 32 opened up so close to my house.  Just like their other locations, both the food and service are excellent.  Lots of options on the menu so there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Blue 32 is my new local favorite go do spot.  There are so many good choices on the menu.  I have yet to have a bad meal here.  The food is all so fresh and delicious.  But even more important is have fabulous the staff is.  They are all so friendly and helpful.  Also there are so many TV's you never are without a view of your favorite game.   I can't wait for my next visit to Blue 32!"}
{"text":"Everything was awesome today! Waitress was super fast got our order in and our food was delicious today, will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Average sports bar nothing extremely exciting. Good service and nice atmosphere. My only complaint: now sound on for any of the games in the bar area and its surrounded by tvs. I'm sure they could turn sound on but You would kind of expect it to already be on."}
{"text":"Yay!  A sports bar that is CLEAN!  The decor is nice, the menu has good food (pricey, yes).  You can also get speakerboxes to hear the game, very important!"}
{"text":"First time here at this sports grill and it was a great experience. The food was cooked right, the service was spectacular and not overbearing. My favorite part was how dog friendly the staff and restaurant is. The server not only served us but was generous and gave out dogs their own water bowls. A very welcoming environment and great place to watch the play offs."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. I like to come here and hang out with friends. Tends to get busy quickly, but that is expected of a sports bar. They do a great job of keeping everyone taken care of. My drink never gets empty and my food is always perfect."}
{"text":"Blue 32 is a pretty good sports bar. We sat outside and they were accommodating with our request on the tv's. I ordered the buffalo chicken flatbread which was better than i expected and the frozen sangria is excellent. Food is a little more expensive than most sports bars, but it is a good place to grab dinner if going to the movies next door. Happy hour specials are descent but only run Monday-Friday."}
{"text":"We love Blue 32!!!! We have been coming here for about 5 years and we have never had a bad experience!!!!! The staff is so wonderful!!!!! The ribs are a must have...the best we have ever had.  The onion rings and artichoke spinach dip are amazing!!!!! We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the loudest, echoing sports bars I have ever been to; pretty bad when the first thing you notice when you walk in is the noise level and I have been here 3 times.  Even if I am out to enjoy a game with my friends, I don't want to have to yell across the table at them.   The waiter was excellent and very friendly but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"TBH, I have not had a bad meal yet at B32. We often frequent the Gilbert location on Higley and we are always welcomed with a pleasant smile. The food is awesome here and cooked to order. Tonight I had the grilled salmon and wow was it tasty. The wings are also a must. The steamed broccoli was on point and great taste. GreAt atmosphere and lots of T.Vs to watch your favorite sporting event. Be sure to get there early particularly on Friday's. If you are in the area stop in for a cold  or 2."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night around 6:30pm and there was a 20min wait, which is a good sign. We ordered a drink at the very full bar (quick service btw) and hung out until our buzzer went off but we spotted a free bar table which was first-come first-serve. We were greeted as soon as we sat down by our server who was super energetic and friendly. He was also very attentive even though he was busy, which we greatly appreciated. My husband and I shared the calamari (standard but yummy), and I had a ceasar salad (basic)  and black & blue burger (packed with flavor and quality patty). My husband had the monte cristo sandwich with onion rings (perfectly cooked and plentiful) which he said the sandwich was nicely done with a great jam. Only thing is that the crust could have been a little more crispy. The whole bill with 4 beers was only $52!"}
{"text":"Good wings.  Good, fast service as we stopped by for appetizers and drinks before a movie.   Drinks are well priced too."}
{"text":"Great sports bar. Good beer selection (read: they serve Four Peaks Hop Knot). Good food. I heard other Yelpers raving about the tacos, and sure enough they are pretty darn tasty. I'd certainly come back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!    Love their happy hour specials.   The Blue 32 martini rocks.   Burgers are tasty and the cheese fries are addicting!    It's always crowded so come early or plan to wait.  But it's worth it."}
{"text":"Nicolas was amazing! The food is great!!! We have a new spot!!! Awesome service all around!!!!"}
{"text":"Blue 32 is a great place to come for some bar food and drinks any day of the week. There are many TV's to watch any game and a small outdoor patio to enjoy your meal. It was not too over crowded and the atmosphere was enjoyable.   Ordered a burger and opted for the sweet potato fries instead of regular, wasn't the best. My friends also had burgers with sweet potato fries and gobbled them up! But I would come back or suggest to you if you are looking for this sort of place to eat."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken sandwich is the best!  Baked potato soup is def worth trying as well!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Blue 32 last night. I've been a few times, and had a great experience each time. The place was pretty slow on a Sunday night, which allowed us to get a seat right away. The past couple times were more busy. Either way, the food and service are great. I have loved their wings, ribs, and buffalo chicken sandwich. The staff are friendly and quick. The place has typically had a pretty loud volume level, but I think a lot of that is the quantity of people there. I would definitely recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"What are your hours?? I have been here three times and each time the hours have been different. In no way the same experience as your awesome restaurant on val vista and Williams field. I cannot rate the food or service because each time I have come with guests you have been closed. For one reason or another."}
{"text":"I can't speak for anything other than the chili and the onion rings. Both are the best I have tasted. I will shamelessly order them whenever I'm in the area.  Devine."}
{"text":"Great Father's Day meal, thanks! AND Thank You to Casey for the wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Checked out this new sports bar in Chandler last week for the final four games had really good service atmosphere was nice, and it was very full but something about the design was really lacking.  As a lot of restaurants and bars and Chandler go up they always seem to be a little bit unfinished or just unplanned with no real concern for layout, amenities or ambience.  Thought it was a little odd that they went to Market with about thirty old school 2005 Panasonic TVs, but otherwise a decent experience."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch, expecting great things from what I had heard. Despite the fact the restaurant was almost empty, the service was awful. The waitress was more interested in chatting up the other male server and giggling with him in the corner than serving her 1 table (us!). It took a long time for our order to be taken and the friendliness of the staff was certainly lacking - won't go back in a hurry!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is Great every time we go here! Regal was our server and was EXCELLENT!! We'll be back soon for the Applewood Bacon BLT & onion rings with chipotle ranch dipping sauce. AWESOME!"}
{"text":"There is nothing like ordering a half slab of ribs and finding hair in my food. That's pretty disgusting.  The manager came out and apologized. He comped my meal and ordered more ribs for me. The second slab came out. I actually enjoyed them until I came to the last rib. There was another hair baked into the sauce! Manager came out again,  apologized profusely and comped the  whole table. This was my first and last time at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been here on a number of occasions.  Boneless wings are awesome.  Atmosphere is hit or miss."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, and it remains one of our favorite restaurants. The food is exactly as you hope it would be. The classic Bacon Burger is delicious, and huge. The grilled salmon couldn't be more scrumptious..the mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli are awesome sides.  Even something simple like the sliders are always impressive. The service never disappoints....especially Jill. She's awesome! We love this restaurant and highly recommend you stop in."}
{"text":"I was having my car serviced in North Scottsdale, off of Scottsdale Rd and knew this place was in walking distance. I wanted to watch my favorite basketball team and have a brew. As I walked up to Blue 32 I wondered if it was still there. Blue 32 doesn't have a bunch of promo florescent lights or flashy outside signs or tricks, it is understated. As I grew closer I heard the people out on the TV strewn patio and knew they were open.   Blue 32 is very nice inside, open and airy, with large doors leading to the patio. High tables, the bar and some booths welcomed me in. Very nice decorating, very comfortable (I'm male so take that into consideration). I walked right up to the bar with it's row of large flat-panel TVs showing most of the live NCAA basketball games. I knew I was going to have a great afternoon when I saw the beer handles: lots of local craft-brews, some San Diego brews and a couple of national brews. I started with one of the pale ales, but then moved on the IPAs.  I was hungry but didn't want to dive into an entre or dinner, so I just ordered the wings: hot, grilled (they offer non-grilled too), with ranch. What I received was a surprise! The wings were crisp, not gooey, and big, nicely big, lots of meat. I did not have to wait long to get them either. As a single guy who eats his share of chicken wings, these have to be the best wing experience I have had in years.  The game was exciting and after while I wanted to nosh on something so I had the chicken tenders with fries.  Another surprise that will keep me going back!  I will start with the tenders but please read further to get a review of the excellent french fries. The tenders were crisp and a light brown. The crust was spiced well and was not greasy to the touch. Then I bit into one. I still can't believe how tender these chicken tenders were. I can eat tenders well done  and small but I prefer not to. These chicken tenders were tender, juicy and flavorful. I wonder if they have fried chicken on the entre/dinner menu. If so, they would be delicious!  Now, the fries. Homemade but sliced thin, kinda thin, not like shoestrings or curly thin, just not a \"homefries\" kind of thick potatoes. These fries were coated with spice and some crispy crust but I could certainly taste the potatoe flavor. The were hot and crispy and just done enough to still be al dente. These were by far the best french fries I have ever experienced. I had quite a few on my plate but ate them all and wanted more to just nosh on during the second half of the game. I did not order more though, because I was quite satisfied.  My server/bartender was quite freindly, knowledgeable (but needed to be more of a beer expert in my opinion) and attentive. A manager was behind the bar occasionally to check the beers and he also was quite friendly. I learned that Blue 32 has local craft beers as standard then they have six handles that rotate.   I really like this place. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, okay drinks, clean place, great environment-especially if you're there for the football.   Service is an absolute hit or miss."}
{"text":"Awesome Happy hour appetizers! They are also the best place to get a frozen margarita!"}
{"text":"Ate there a couple days ago with friends, on a Friday about 6pm  which was during happy hour. Waited 45 min for a table. They were busy and it was very noisy. But, good food and service! Our group ordered several happy hour appetizers. They were all good. I especially liked nachos."}
{"text":"Great staff, awesome food! Love the bbq chicken salad, buffalo chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries. Great kids menu as well!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick dinner/drinks around happy hour and was pleasantly surprised! The happy hour prices are spot on for appetizers and beer while watching one of the many TVs. We started with the calamari that were coated in a much lighter batter than other places- yum! I wasn't a fan of the sauce it came with, but they were able to bring a side of ranch for me to enjoy. Our entree's came out quickly and I couldn't be happier! The buffalo chicken sandwich was the perfect amount of spice and I had upgraded to the potato soup to make the meal even better. My husband raved about the carne asada and the portion sizes were perfect. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best \"so called\" Sport Bar in the valley ... an its in my back yard ...thats why it gets my 5 star attention.   The moron's that rate it any lower ... stay the hell out of my bar!  They have 4 Peak's beer on tap, stiff pour drinks, great service, a small yet diverse menu (and get this) ... grind their own angus beef & fresh dip onion rings. Who does that?  If you like the taste of fresh quality beef, I've found no better burgers in town. Order them with no sauce and revel in there beefy goodness.   On the lighter side, order the Mahi taco's. If you want to taste the quality of the fish special order them with \"very light' seasoning. That mean's no canjun seasoning, ask them for even reduced quantity of their normal salt & pepper. This goes for all their seafood IMO.   You can thank me later, I'll be at the bar."}
{"text":"Wow. Great place. Friendly people and good food at a great price . I take my d as miley and friends here often . Try the fried pickles."}
{"text":"Second time in three months and this place again earns 5 stars. It's a nice restaurant, very good service, delicious food and plenty of it, dang reasonable prices! So much shrimp on the Po Boy that I had to take some off to eat it. Great onion rings, too. My wife's chicken strips were plump, juicy and huge. Not stingy on their pours either. A great go-to restaurant/bar for a great time and good eats."}
{"text":"Wow!! Amazing. The food, service and prices. They go above and beyond. Vey nice atmosphere and very laid back crowd we go here whenever we are in the area.."}
{"text":"This review is mainly on a disappointing experience I had with our Fantasy Draft. We called ahead and confirmed that they had wifi. We reserved a table which was waiting for us when we got there. However, nobody could get on the wifi. There was another table doing their draft and they couldn't get on as well. We had 10 people and had to go to Buffalo Wild Wings to get on the Internet. Even though we asked to speak with the Manager, he never came by. I certainly wouldn't schedule a draft here."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Happy Hour with my family. The service and food were great. Not too loud for a sports bar and that's not a bad thing. Definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"Went in last night, place came recommended by friends.  My burger was under done and the fish for the fish and chips didn't smell fresh (fish and chips were served to the table next to us).    Two stars because although the experience was not great our server James was a rock star."}
{"text":"Something wrong with the beer. Tasted like it was pumped through a sewer line. Server couldn't care less. Didn't bother to even ask why we left full glasses on the table as she zipped past avoiding is. I'm not sure I've given 1 star before but this is well deserved. Couldn't drag me back."}
{"text":"Decided to check out my neighbor sports bar and grill! Bar is nice with plenty of TVs. Great selection of local beers but limited non-local craft beers.  I ordered the hot wings which were a nice size and very flavorful.  The hot sauce is made in house and has kind of a green chili flavor, very very good but not really spicy. Def will be back to check out the other items!"}
{"text":"Blue 32 sports Grill is one of the best sports bar in south Chandler. The staff is friendly and you can find about anything you like to eat on their menu. Nice to be able to go watch your favorite sports team with multiple TVs. Don't be surprised when you go if you run into someone you know. The place is always busy because it's a great local hang out"}
{"text":"Have been several times since this review, always sit in dining room, service great like the food, even catered Christmas lunch for my office, great food and everyone raved about how good everything was! The chopped chicken salad is my favorite, the chocolate chip cookies are always made fresh - try them they are addictive!!!"}
{"text":"Great new Sports Bar. Have been to other Blue 32's in Gilbert and by San Tan Village This is Same Great Food. Maybe little smaller but great decor. Had lunch Salmon. Grilled \"Perfect\". Sometimes other places overcook. But all the Blue's including this new one -perfect , different but Very Good with Lemon Rice and steamed Fresh Broccoli. Wife had \"lunch\" portion Chicken Fry Salad. Hugh, Fresh Made and more than enough.  Staff friendly and fast service. Enough TV with all different channels. Great New addition too our area"}
{"text":"Only second time stopped. It was recommended the Onion Rings and Salmon Lunch Special. Super. Great. Flawless. So Fresh. Steamed broccoli -perfect. Last time had Baked Potato Soup. Next time bowl not just a cup. We will be stopping for a while trying all different dishes. So far none have even been Average- they are\" 5star\"   Almost forgot. All TV's  large and all different sports.  Really Perfect !!!!!    Wait staff is happy-quick-and suggestions are Great"}
{"text":"First timer.  But now Not Last......  I love soup. Love Potato soup. Ordered a cup. Shoulddda had a Bowl. Sooo Good. Then ordered 32 Blue Steak Sub. To Much. Lots of tender grill steak Lots of mushrooms.  Lots of Cheese. Hot - Sloppy - so freaken good. You would think I Had Not Eaten In A Month.  Was a little slow at 3 pm when were there. Waitress explained how everything is Fresh-house made- never frozen. Recommend Onion Rings next time thank you 32 Blue. New Customer"}
{"text":"We live in Seville, and have been going to the Blue32 up on Val Vista and Williams Field.  We waited anxiously for this to open, and all of the anticipation led to some really high expectations.    I'm happy to report that our expectations have been exceeded twice in a row.   Last time, we were seated at a table with a server named Amanda and we loved her.  The food was great (I had the Alfredo pasta, very flavorful) but my favorite every time is the strawberry daiquiri.  They're made with real strawberries rather than gloppy corn syrup mix, and the taste is miles apart.    We couldn't remember our awesome servers name this trip (sorry Amanda) but we won't forget because we've now immortalized her in this review.    She's thoughtful.  We had been dithering about what to order (flatbread? Shrimp poboy? Steak?) When a massive party arrived, requiring extra tables and chairs to be brought in, she was nice enough let us know so we could get our order in before they were all seated.    We never wanted for a drink or water refill, food was correct and piping hot, and she's just delightful.    Also... Fresh Strawberry daiquiris... Did I mention that..???"}
{"text":"I had the chicken pecan salad hubby had chicken avocado club.  They were both delish!! Highly recommend both those dishes. Our server was awesome. No wait time for a Saturday afternoon. We will be regulars here. Sorry no pictures."}
{"text":"Blue 32 Sports Grill delivers the goods since opening up a few months ago. This place is closer to home but the parking can drive you crazy on a Friday night (it's next to the movie theatre). There's usually some spots on the side and back of the building instead of trying to park directly in front of the restaurant.  I usually give 4 stars to a place that has at least one item on the menu that is consistently outstanding. For me, that is the Monte Cristo Sandwich. Fried goodness of turkey, ham and cheese along with that insanely delicious raspberry jam that I generously apply to the sandwich. And don't forget the fries, yes these are some of the best tasting fries I have ever had. I haven't had a chance to try any other items off the menu from this location. But I'm looking forward to trying the pulled pork sandwich to see if it is as good as the Scottsdale Rd location.  The service always seems to be pretty good and there are tons of TV's all around. This place is a mob scene during March Madness and NBA/NHL playoff season."}
{"text":"Great for sports fans! Tons of food variety with nice big portions."}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly and helpful, Savvy is awesome. She complimented the great food perfectly. It makes a big difference when a server acknowledges our kids and makes sure to communicate with them and genuinely seems to care about service and experience. Everything from the tacos, salad, soup and burger were great."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and really enjoyed it. Food is really good, and the service is great! First time I had their buffalo chicken salad. Very filling, portion is large, but you might need to order double chicken? Second time I just had a burger, once again it was great. The only issue I had was they were not able to show any of the UFC that was going on at the time? Only reason I didn't give them a five star rating, Still a great place,"}
{"text":"I have been coming here literally since the day they opened and have never had a bad meal or poor service.    To list all the things I love about Blue would take all day.  Suffice to say that they have great food, great service, great beer and a great attitude.   The best Philly cheesesteak ever, fish tacos, chicken fried chicken, blue bacon burger, salads..........."}
{"text":"I regularly go here for lunch with friends Great atmosphere and very clean  The service is excellent every time  Five star bar in Gilbert"}
{"text":"Good and friendly service but food tastes like it's been frozen and heated in microwave. Seriously, not sure what exactly was wrong with last night's meal but one thing it lacked was flavor. My sister ordered the bruchetta, which is their version of bruchetta. This stuff was soggy and more like a buttery garlic bread. My philly cheesesteak didnt have hardly any onions or peppers in it so I had to ask for more, believing these ingredients would give it more flavor. Didn't work. I think if I go back I'll just order the wings and stick to that kind of bar food."}
{"text":"Great food Nice atmosphere bartender Brandon plays well with others lol nice kid . I will say we like the other ones in gilbert  a little better as it's A different feel and a little bit more laid-back. This one feels like they tried to shove a bar into a commercial area"}
{"text":"For a sports bar this is at the top of our list. Great food .yes they do have some of that bar food but this place is much better the that;) they have some great food .I just can't seem to get away from the carney  Asada is the best.. I have some great salads and stuff. Many screens to watch sports on and full bar.always clean.parking is sometimes a little bit of a hassle  But not to bad."}
{"text":"For a bar the food is great for a bar.,. Alright beer section and cold mugs;)) The carney Asada  is amazing...service is pretty good too;)"}
{"text":"Normally we have had a good family experience here.  But to respond to the snotty dark haired hostess: 1) no, I did not know the No Wait app was only for your Seville location 2) yes, I know its March Madness - thats actually why I brought my family with me 3) then to ask the people behind me if they want a table and not me guarentees we will not be back for a long long LONG time."}
{"text":"Great shrimp po-boy!  I was very pleased with the loaded fries. Expected fries topped with fake nacho cheese sauce and soy bacon crumble but got fries topped with real cheddar and real bacon.  Great service. Waited a little while on seating. Recommend using \"NoWait\" app."}
{"text":"hello there  I went there last night we had sucha great time the server did  such a wonderful job always  checking in on us to make sure we have everything what a great job"}
{"text":"We have been here twice a week since they opened. We love the food! The mushroom Swiss burger, the Cuban sandwich, the turkey bacon sandwich and the salads are great.( the prices are higher than most). Almost everyone is all smiles and friendly.      There is only one disappointment. One server has waited on us twice. She does not smile and she does not have a warm or friendly manner. Both times she did the absolute minimum in the way of service. The first time, she couldn't wait to hand us over to the next shift server because she said she was leaving. She stayed and talked to coworkers the whole time we were there. We couldn't understand why it was taking so long to get our bill. Our replacement server said that B. told her we wanted to sit for awhile and catch up(!?). I was there with my husband of 40 yrs. it was a total fabrication.      Today, B. came to our table, no smile, no friendly attitude. She took our order, and brought our drinks. She brought our delicious food and a few minutes later asked us if \"everything is still ok\". Then, it all fell apart. She wandered around, watching the tables fill up and taking a few orders, but never coming back to refill our drinks, never noticed we were done eating. I watched her continue to wander, go to the back, come out empty handed, talk to a coworker but never observed that we needed attention. Finally after about 15 mins. She walked up, ignored our empty drinks and food waiting for boxes and asked \"Are you ready for your check?\"     B. needs some very basic remedial training. She needs to know to offer drink refills. She needs to be observant. She needs to understand how important smiling and a friendly attitude is in a service industry. Hopefully, management will train her. From now on, we will ask for Anyone but B."}
{"text":"Grand opening today for this new location. The restaurant has a lot of TV's for game viewing. It is very open, so you can see almost all of them at once. The food is fantastic, and the staff is extremely friendly. I am excited for this new South Chandler location."}
{"text":"Love this place. Taylor and Kyler are usually my goto servers. Never have to track them down or ask for anything; they're always on top of it. The place is pretty nice, all of the food is usually good, and the staff is excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Our go to place when we are hungry.  Good for last minute, the staff is super nice, attentive, and care for their customers!! Best Baked Potato Soup, hands down!!!  Never a bad meal here. Our glasses are never empty, even on a busy game night. Great quality, Great service.  I can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Blue 32, especially now, as it is so close to home.  The original location was one that I frequented but this new location will be my primary from now on.    Blue 32 has an extensive menu and my go to food choices include the chicken mushroom flatbread and the Blue 32 steak sandwich.  Food is always good, hot and plentiful.  Staff so far has been very good.  Extensive bar and drink options.  Blue 32 is primarily a sports bar and has lots of TVs to choose from.  Blue 32 is great for food and drinks.  This will be our new neighborhood hang out."}
{"text":"This review is from a reason trip to Arizona. We were in town over March Madness and wanted to find a place to watch some games and have lunch. This place is super clean and modern and we loved that, TONS and TONS of tvs.  Unfortunately the food just wasn't very good. Our waiter gave us the spiel about how they are a sports bar but all about gourmet food. Maybe that set us up for disappointment?  The best thing about my meal? That they served steamed broccoli as an option instead of fries as a side...and it was actually good. The wrap was just not good at all, they forgot the sauce...wtf? I asked for it on the side but honestly, it still wouldn't have been good even with the sauce."}
{"text":"Food and service is excellent. A classy but reasonably priced sports bar. Took my wife there and she lived it. Best baked potato soup I ever tasted. Great burger too."}
{"text":"I I'm hesitant to give three stars because there are 6 people in the bar happy hours been going on for almost an hour now you got to think the prices need to be changed or something definitely needs to be given away the location is great however I just don't understand how it can be empty during happy hour. The bartender Sally Is awesome but something else has to be missing because no one's here."}
{"text":"Came to do my review thinking this place was new. Guess not.  But they do everything very well, great service, great food, lots of TV's but it doesn't feel like a lame bar, and the food is REALLY good.  What you expect but done just a little bit better."}
{"text":"I had to update this review...Blue 32 has good food for it being a bar and i have been coming here religiously for a lil over a year but i found it funny i keep ordering the same items and my bill kept going up?!  Huh may just an slight increase in price i thought..Nope they were charging me for CONDIMENTS. ...yes...i didnt stutter. So next time you order that burger and fries or whatever that appetizes you..make sure ketchup or that honey musturd is included in the price. Wow!"}
{"text":"Had the rib and wings combo, great ribs! Get the mashed potatoes  delicious. Son had the burger was perfect. Chicken sandwich was juicy and wife had the candied pecan and goat cheese salad with chicken.  Tons of TVs, you can't miss a thing"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Really good food. Responsible prices. Parking is a little Challenging.  All in all, a solid sports bar with good food"}
{"text":"Really great food and great service. A little expensive for a sports bar, but we go regularly before or after a movie."}
{"text":"The Smoked Burger with baked beans was really good. Best baked beans in Chandler. I also have had the Chicken Avocado Club wrap. Really good food, awesome service, cold beer and several TV screens for your viewing pleasure."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and the food is always great but the service is lacking.  Slow and inattentive. I don't ask for much but we waited 15 minutes for menus during our last trip. Both times we have had to wait for dipping sauces that we asked for at the time we ordered and drink refills . The last trip we never did get silverware, good thing we ordered apps, that while not my first choice, could be eaten with fingers. We took drink napkins from the bar to use as napkins.    All in all if you can overlook the service the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Really good food. Only gripe would be a menu that say it's available until 11AM only to learn that it's really only available to 10:45. We will be giving another place a try for football next Sunday. We'll be back for sure....just a bad experience."}
{"text":"Great place. I sat here for a while today at Ashley's table. Good service and good food. I had the shrimp Po boy and it was excellent. French fries and onion rings also very very good. Think this may be the best sports bar concept that I have ever been in."}
{"text":"The ahi was bad in my salad, so I asked the waitress for another salad...choice the southwestern.  The lettuce in that was old and brown.  I NEVER complain...when I told the waitress it too was not good, she was not apologetic, instead she socked the rude manager on me.  He basically accused me of not knowing the difference between wilted lettuce and lettuce tossed in balsamic vinegarette...horrible place, will not be back!"}
{"text":"The burgers were very dry and not juicy. But the fries were very good! Except for the fact I had a wing inside my bundle of french fries. Haha sorta gross. The waitress got my boyfriends order wrong and when he tried to mention something. She just waved it off and said the only difference was the seasoning? A smoke house burger comes with bacon, onion rings and BBQ sauce. When it came out it was a burger patty covered with portobello mushrooms and Swiss. Yeah not the same. You or the kitchen made a mistake. Just fix it properly. Don't try to misguide us saying you gave us the right order. Won't be returning..."}
{"text":"Just your average sports bar here... Food is average, service was average, prices were maybe higher than average... I really don't have a ton to say about something so average...  Not bad Not great Average  Only made 1 trip here..."}
{"text":"Only been here once but will return again. Food was good and was at the table rather quickly. Price was fair. Service was great. Arrived 50 minutes from closing, but had time to order, eat and pay just before closing. Staff were nothing but courteous."}
{"text":"The beer was cold and the server (Drew) was great until I complained about the pork dinner being dry. I told her not to bring me more food.  She said no one ever told her the pork was bad.  I at least expected the pork to be taken off the bill.  NOT. I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Came in here to watch the game the other night for the first time.  Really liked the atmosphere and it was easy to get a table even at the peak of happy hour.  Great spread of TVs and they had the game sound on loud enough to be heard.  We had some happy hour drinks and apps and everything we ate and drank was really good.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  The best thing I can probably say about this place is how reasonable the prices are.  Even off happy hour food was very nicely priced.  I really appreciate this in a world where bar food is starting to get a little outrageous.  For sure will be back for another game!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks; happy hour until 630PM. Our favorites are the black and blue burger, buffalo chicken flat bread pizza, and fish and chips. Definitely recommend using the No Wait app to get yourself in line as the wait gets long around dinner time."}
{"text":"Located next to a multi screen movie theater in a shopping center at Scottsdale Road and the 101. So parking close may be a challenge. Once inside you will be greeted by an insane number of TVs! No matter where you sit you should be able to watch at least 10 different screens at once. So not a bad place to watch your favorite game. I was glad to see that they support the local craft brews as they carry a few. I selected the Four Peaks IPA \"Hop Knot\". The food menu consist of the usual burgers and tacos as most sports bars do. However, I noticed they also have steaks and even salmon and ahi tuna in the menu. Since I already ate I will have to return to try the food."}
{"text":"Yummy food, Rebbeca was awesome super friendly and knowledgeable, great value for what you get !"}
{"text":"Me and my friend stopped in to have dinner on a Saturday night at the bar. Our bartender Aley suggested the sliders and the tacos al carbon.Great food and she makes a awesome cadillac margarita with fantastic service.  Tried to eat here the night before but the wait was insane. Now i know why. Next time  we will wait. Awesome spot will revist everytime"}
{"text":"I've been to lunch here several times during the week and it was just so-so. However ribs are awesome.  They have an appetizer that is like a third slab (perfect amt for me).  They literally fall off the bone and come with some pretty good fries for like 9 bucks.  Too many fries though.  Would be 4 stars but have had really slow service during the work week."}
{"text":"Good service, turn the air conditioning on. It's way too hot in here, I'm not a china man in a sweat shop."}
{"text":"Great food (the pesto chicken is my favorite!!), reasonable prices, great family place (for kids of all ages), great service, and near our home!  We just moved to Gilbert and this has become our new local favorite.  Just remember to make reservation for Friday and Saturday nights because it can get packed sometimes!"}
{"text":"Amazing junky bar food.  I got the nachos which came with an awesome cheese sauce and the onion rings which were battered to flakey perfection.  The restaurant itself is sort of like a Buffalo Wild Wings and can get very loud during peak times.  I wouldn't recommend for an intimate dinner, but great if you want to grab some good food and hangout."}
{"text":"Th food and service was great Blue cheese dressing was amazing!!! Price was good for quality of food we"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is always excellent!  I come for the bloody Mary each time!  Believe me I needed one today and they were prompt and made it the way I like it!   Awesome job Blue 32. I recommend you to my family and fiends!"}
{"text":"No real atmosphere at all. Bar was constructed like a Kitchen Counter. Great TV's. I-Hop style menu. Staff was busy talking to each other most of the time I was there. I give the place another 6 months top to survive."}
{"text":"1st time here Monday night. Arrived at 530p to meet a girlfriend for Happy Hour and was pleased that it was served to the entire restaurant, not just the bar area. I ordered a draft beer and she ordered a Cosmo Martini, we both enjoyed our drinks and we ordered off the HH menu that is served till 7pm.  We ordered the bruscetta and buffalo shrimp.  Both were excellent.  Our server was Colton, he was very attentive and helpful in recommendations.  Since we probable overstayed our time limit till 8pm, he never continued to provide excellent service even though he probably would have like to turn the table to another family. Will definitely be back and don't know why it has taken me so long to try this neighborhood restaurant.  We don't have many options in this area. I'm craving the buffalo shrimp, it was so delicious, and the HH prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"It gets very packed for games and Friday happy hour.  Blue 32 is a good sports bar, lots and lots of TVs, clean, nice decor The women's restroom is luxurious as far as restrooms in sports bars are concerned.  The service is just okay.  Over Christmas they had these specialty drinks made with all the rich, decadent liquors.  One of them was a martini with graham cracker crust on the rim of the glass - I had two of those holiday spirits, sooo good!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  We are regulars!  There are enough TV's to see any game!  The staff is always friendly.  It is not just bar food that you would find in a typical sports bar.  The food is great with a lot of selections."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick happy hour drink because I had some time to kill before meeting the family at outback steakhouse.  I actually went to outback first but after realizing that their beer and drink selection was crap I decided to head over to blue 32.  The bartender Steph was really nice and engaging in conversation.  I ended up having 2 drinks before meeting the family and will be back on a Sunday when their 4 Peaks beer selection is only $4 for a 22oz.  Good time and friendly bartenders!"}
{"text":"Been to this place many times last year. The only problem with this place is very very over price for what you get. Spend your time elsewhere and save yourself tons of $$$. The food and service is okay nothing to write about."}
{"text":"Just got back from Blue 32 and realized I probably made a mistake by going during a Cardinals game on my first visit!  We got there at 5:20 and the wait was almost an hour.    When we did finally get seated, my son was very hungry so I went ahead and ordered his food as soon as the waitress came to take our drink order.  I was really pleased that it took less than 10 minutes for his food to come out, even as busy as they were.  The mini hamburgers were a little greasy but they had a lot of flavor.  The fries were seasoned and really good.  It took a little bit for the waitress to come back to take my order - an 8 oz sirloin, med rare, with sides of steamed broccoli & smashed red potatoes.  When I got my dinner, I was disappointed to see that it was cooked more medium to medium well than medium rare.  I was even more disappointed after I took a bite because it was a great cut with little fat and well seasoned.  I really wish they hadn't damaged it because it probably would've been great.  The broccoli was fine but I found the smashed potatoes too greasy and over salted, it was like they'd been sitting in butter for while before being served.  After dinner we ordered the brownie ala mode.  The brownie was pretty decadent, any chocolate lover would be very pleased.  The ice cream was just mediocre though - like a store brand instead of haagen-daaz.  On a side note, I agree with others there wasn't much in the way of happy-hour food specials, but domestic drafts at $2.75 are a fair deal.  I will definitely give this place another shot because the atmosphere was great, a lot of TVs for watching sports and a good crowd, and I think the food has potential when it's not as slammed."}
{"text":"I'm from Cincinnati, ate here tonight. Had the ribs and wings combo and it was great. We have Montgomery Inn ribs in Cincy so others never match up, but the ribs here were fall off the bone and good. The wings were also good. Happy hour is great with $6 martinis and $3.75 drafts. Bartender Bo was great. Highly recommend for casual night dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"I loooove the Cajun Style Salmon. Seriously, it's so delicious. It's probably got enough sodium to float a person in a pool for a couple days, but whatever. Who doesn't love salt?  This is the place to come for good wings and good beer and 34 televisions to watch the game. I was here for the BCS game and so was everyone else in a 10 mile radius. It was fun! Rowdy, but everyone was very cool and no jerks to be heard.   As soon as the game ends, the place empties out pretty quick, but it's never dead. Being right across the plaza from the movie theatre makes it the perfect place to grab a drink and bite to eat before or after your flick.   I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and the menu was pretty big and had a good variety.  Kids menu was also good and they were willing to split one up for us with two picky eaters.  Chicken sandwiches had good flavor and were not over-cooked like most places.  Onion rings were fantastic and I strongly recommend.  Only knock was that prices are much higher than competitors like Zipps and Native, however I guess you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Excellent service great food!!! Friday night family dinner. Came into Arizona to help daughter move and found this diamond in the rough. We'll definitely come here again. Fresh hot good service!!!"}
{"text":"Nice sports bar & grill. Hubby had the chicken salad and I had the fish tacos. Both were delicious and the perfect size for a light lunch. The waitress was super nice and checked on us several times. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We always enjoyed the Onion Rings with homemade rings, not those bought frozen ones. The New Menu is great!!"}
{"text":"Great service, food came out quickly. I would recommend any burger, honestly, amazing beef cooked the way you like it. Environment is relaxed."}
{"text":"The new Blue 32 is really nice! Great addition to South Gilbert! The layout is awesome. There's a nice dining section of tables/booths for everyone including families, spacious bar area segregated from the dining area for those rowdy, beer swilling, hard core Gilbertians and an awesome wrap around patio. We were lucky enough to sit in Erin's section in the bar area and were well taken care of. Excellent Golden Tee location and the food was way better than expected! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Chandler Location at AZ Ave /Chandler Height!  The food is wonderful!  Always looking for a good pastrami sandwich, and they have pastrami sliders that are wonderful!  The staff is friendly and fun!  Great place to go to watch sports!  Excited to go back, and try more items on the menu!!  Good job!!!"}
{"text":"Needed to grab some food after being at the Cigar Bar..was a nice sports bar.. I had the pastrami sliders and loaded french fries.. and OMG was it good! I want to try everything on thier menu! Their prices were good too!"}
{"text":"I totally love this place. The place is clean and staff is friendly. There food is awesome and service is wonderful! It's a little loud due to having a bar but it's a small price to pay for good food. When ordering to pick up the food is still nice and hot. I will be eating there again."}
{"text":"Pretty average on every front from food to staff to drinks nothing that will stand out."}
{"text":"We love that this is close to our house, but after the service this last time we will drive further for any place else.   We came in and sat at the bar. After a beer I wanted to switch to wine. I ordered my $12.50 glass and when the glass was delivered it was so dirty I would not drink out of it.   I asked the waiter for a new glass of wine. My husband told me to keep an eye on the glass as he had a feeling they were going to pour the wine from the dirty soap scum glass into another glass. Sure enough I watched the bartender do just this. When the waiter brought it back we explained what we witnessed and he stated he was sorry, but this is how the bartender said they are to do it!!!   He took the glass back and it sat there for another 10 minutes as we received dirty looks from the bartender after our waiter pointed to us from the bar as he was explaining our disappointment to him.   The nachos and the wrap we also ordered were good or this would be a one star."}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday celebration and the hostess told us the wait was 15 mins..so we decided to wait for it...45 minutes later and a few other groups of people being seated before us even though we were there first, so we decided to leave and went to the other restaurant next to it. We were glad we left because who knows how much longer we had to wait. I don't mind waiting but if the hostess told us 15 minutes..I don't mind waiting 5 or 10 minutes longer but it was ridiculous that we waited over 45 minutes to almost an hour and she didn't even say anything to us. It seems that the hostess there didn't really know what she was doing..alll she was saying to people showing up was 15 minutes wait,which obviously it wasn't. I would have been glad if we were notified of our status for waiting that long but we weren't. We went there June 23rd, which was a Thursday around 6:30 pm...so whoever worked there in the front,  please work on you customer service..it sucks because we really wanted to eat there but was turned off by the front personnel attitude or lack of services."}
{"text":"Prices are high but the food is top notch. Great date night out or chilling with friends. They have an outdoor smoking patio which is always a plus. The staff is attentive and the bartenders are great. The shrimp appetizer is one of the best things on the menu. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decent bar room food, good location to the Alamo movie theater, dinner and a movie good date night."}
{"text":"I just moved to Gilbert and been there twice now. The first time was with a buddy and I had a burger. It was amazing.   What made me decide to write the review was my visit on Sunday. I try to make my Sundays with my daughter very special. We wanted to watch the Colts so decided to go. We waited a while to get sat, but they put us right in front of a TV showing the game in a booth that they could have fit 8 people into. We had the calamari, followed by a Monte Cristo. At halftime, she wanted desert so we had the Apple Crisp. All of which were fantastic. The fact that they sat a mid 30s dad and his daughter in a spot they could have used for a larger party is something that I won't soon forget. It's that kind of service that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Blue 32 never disappoints. We eat here at least 2x a month and have never had a bad experience. The food is yummy, the restaurant is clean and the service is great. I especially love the philly, buffalo chicken salad and the turkey club."}
{"text":"I have wonderful experiences every time and I am always excited to return to try more things on the menu. So far I have tried the calamari, boneless wings, regular wings, french fries, and their turkey reuben sandwich and all of them were DELICIOUS!  I recommend this place to all of my friends in the area and the ones who have tried it have loved it."}
{"text":"Great sports bar! Friendly and fast service. Chips and queso were BOMB! We got the ribs, and they were some of the best ribs we've had. They fell right off the bone. Chicken tenders were a little bland. Fries were good.   Soooo many TVs and they are happy to switch channels for you, and they do it promptly."}
{"text":"Sometimes you want a good beer with some good food at a reasonable price.  Blue 32 has  a nice selection of beers on tap and some pretty good bar food - all at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood spot. They have great app options and kids menu. Their food isn't consistent and your general bar food. Don't go here for the food, instead it's a great place to see familiar faces and have a beverage. There's no shortage of TV's playing all games you'd want to watch. Nice patio space."}
{"text":"We live nearby and go to Blue 32 once every few weeks.   The food is fantastic.   We have tried nearly everything on the menu and always been pleased.   The service is good.  Usually no wait during the week but can be very busy on Friday evenings."}
{"text":"Amazing food, (shrimp Po Boy) Very clean Tons of high end TV's with everything on  However, I don't care for the crowd.  I don't know if it is because of the location, but there seem to be a bunch of snobs there.  Not to fun watching sports and having a bunch of social misfits in their little click.  The fun part about a sports bar for me is the atmosphere and the people.  It sucks here, but the food, building and everything else is great!  If you are bringing your own friends, this place is for you.  If you are going there with just you and a friend, don't expect much for the people there."}
{"text":"We had date night during March Madness...eek!  20 minute wait at 5pm on a Wednesday was unexpected BUT it was so worth it.  Waiter apologized for the wait, offered recommendations and was jovial.  Kyle, our server likes his job and the company and it showed.  It was refreshing to have great customer service!  The food was great and prepared  exactly as I requested.  We tipped 30% - We will be going there again!!"}
{"text":"We soooo need more restaurant choices in South Chandler so I was glad to see Blue 32 open and was excited to try it....and so glad we did. We've eaten  here 3 times already and have not had a bad meal yet. The staff is very friendly and fast service. I love they have a healthy side choice like broccoli in a bar & grill place where most sides are fried. I would recommend this place and will continue to patronize."}
{"text":"Only downside to this sports bar is how popular it is, which sometimes leaves you stalking seats in the bar area OR if you're one of the lucky ones to get a seat, be prepared to be stalked and feel a little rushed (by other patrons not by the staff) to wrap it up so they can sit down. But they have better than average bar food (the Philly Cheese Steak SALAD is phenomenal), great beer and mixed drink choices, and TONS of TV's."}
{"text":"I started coming to Blue 32 last football season. This is definitely a good place to be during that time if year. You do want to get there early though because it tends to be exceedingly packed. Space can be limited. If you do by chance get a table, I feel that majority of the time, they are attentive even considering the volume of people.   They have a nice set up with Tv's and it is a good time to be had. I have always liked any server I have gotten because they're all personable.   I feel like it's a hit or miss on the food sometimes though. There have been more than one time that the plate I receive has had some type of substitute and no word is mentioned. Like, do they really think I wouldn't remember the absolutely delicious bread that I had previously gotten with my bruchetta? Come on, whole wheat toast? So, of course I mentioned it, at which point the server let me know they had run out. Mind you, I would have ordered something else had I know. There was another incident with a salad. Nevertheless, it evidently wasn't a deal breaker for me because, I still come in and I love the Tacos el Carbon. Oh, and the bruchetta with the delicious bread. They also have options for the kiddos that are pretty standard and never complained about.   We will visit, especially during the season, until there isn't one nearby."}
{"text":"Nice clean typical sports bar.  Tried this place on our son's recommendation.  Food was good but a little over priced. Soda pop was very watery. Service was just ok.  It seemed that the girls were more interested in gossiping than waiting on tables. We are not the sports bar type so with the loud atmosphere it is very unlikely that we will return."}
{"text":"Every time I come here it is awesome. The staff are super friendly. The manager Josh kicks ass."}
{"text":"I love the salads here they are so tasty! This is a cute, trendy neighborhood bar and grill!"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves more promotion and is by far the best for sports grill! Our waiter (Josh L.) was THEE BEST YET, I would give him ALONE 5 stars. We ordered calamari, wings, and loaded fries with cranberry Moscow Mule's. The food was all delicious and alcohol was great (thanks for the recommendation for it all Josh ). We will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of the sports bar atmosphere but this place is really not the norm.  The food and service there are great and there are options for everyone.  It seems to attract a balanced crowd of sports fans, families, and couples so no need to think you will be out of place.  It's like the menu will take the usually foods and but a nice spin on them.  They've got quesadillas but they have them with shrimp and bacon.  There's buffalo chicken wings but they also have buffalo shrimp. How about some fish tacos?  They have those as well but also a blackened shrimp variation as well.  Want some flatbread?  There's a mediterranean variation with feta, olives, greek peppers, onions, and tomatoes.  A friend of mine got the monte cristo sandwich and that is not something I would usually even think about getting but I was ready to fight him for this sandwich.  It was ridiculous....  I mention Blue 32 to lots of friends (female and male) and all respond the same way.  \"Ohhh that place is so good!\"  If you're a world cup fan, they opened super early to show all the games.  Yes I ate buffalo shrimp at 9 am.  Don't judge me. Goal!!!"}
{"text":"Blue 32 has a really great atmosphere and terrific menu.  The menu has everything from soup and salads to sandwiches to pasta.  There is a great beer selection, and happy hour/reverse happy hour in the bar.  They even serve a late night menu in the bar when many places are closed during the week.  For late night last night we had nachos, spinach dip (soooo good), veggie platter and wings.  The beer was cold and the food was hot.  The server was nice and the bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"I am having THE BEST time here for the penguins game. Our bar tender Danielle is super awesome. She made me the bombest martini and my boneless wings were amazing. I will be back for sure! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Was out with my friends for a night of fun, but we needed to stop and get something to eat & just chat, so we wound up at Blue 32, never been here and what a nice little find. Great sports bar with lots of big TV's , do you know how many sports bars I have been in that had tiny TV's that the only people who can watch it was the ones at the bar, left me thinking what's the point.  But here in Blue 32 didn't matter where you sat, you could see the TV well! Oh yea!   Our server was Katie and she was good at making sure our drinks were filled and that we were happy! Thanks Katie!  I ordered the pastrami sliders came with pickle and had mustard on the bun with an order of fries. I am a pastrami lovin fool and these were good little sliders, but were light on the mustard, but asked Katie for a side and she brought me out a bottle! Nicely done!    Look forward to coming back and trying out different things!"}
{"text":"WOW!  I am amazed that a sports bar can have such amazing food.  I dream about the house made ranch dressing.   The calamari is so fresh and cooked perfectly.  We really loved the flavor of the wings and shrimp.  Everything was high quality and fresh.   So happy to have this place by us.  Happy Hour is great here, too!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Shrimp Po'Boy hands down, I also suggest the Monte Cristo if you are looking to splurge (my husband and I split it).  I have never had a bad meal here, even when we bring the kids.  The salads are even tasty.  We had happy hour last week and plan on coming back for more extremely well priced foods.  Full bar and great draft beers, perfect place to watch  game."}
{"text":"A Groupon brought us in here but we would have come anyway as we missed the BWW that was here prior and were anxious for a good new sports bar to open in its place.  We had a great experience.   Hubby had the pastrami (loved it) and I had the BBQ chicken salad; both were excellent.  They were warm, fully-cooked, unlike some of the negative reviews on here about this restaurant.  We experienced only positives from dining here.  It was a Sunday lunch crowd, getting pretty busy, yet our service never suffered.  We sat in the bar area, so the bartender had both bar clients and high-tops and never missed a beat.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Greeted by Ashley Jones. 1st impressions last a lifetime she was great. Nicole served us. Wow doesn't get any better than this. We will be back. Food was great service was better. Great staff !"}
{"text":"Great service. Would have given 5 stars but since you were out of fries I was forced to get onion rings. No big deal until you charged me $1.00 extra per meal for the onion rings. I don't feel like we should have been charged on something that was out of our control."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Regal is a great server!!! Very attentive and kept our drinks filled at all times. He has a great personality as well. I was torn between two meals and gave him the option to pick one out for me and he did not disappoint. The grinder sandwich is amazing. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We have visited Blue 32 as a family of 4, and had great service.  Food is pretty good.  There was something for everyone, even the picky 7 year old.  We also came to eat with a party of 10.  That I don't recommend unless you are very patient.  Now, keep in mind this is a sports bar with a restaurant.  They accomodated our large party, but we had to wait quite a while for another large party to leave.  The staff did not have an estimated wait time for us, since it is a bar and you can order drinks.  Large parties often like to drink, so there we waited.  But, once seated, food was great as usual.  We have always had good service.  Wait staff has always offered suggestions.  Food prices are pretty decent too!"}
{"text":"I think their burger is good. However, I have a suggestion; a better bun. The bun they serve is an ordinary white bread bun. In other words, no flavor or interesting consistency.  In fact, a whole grain option would be nice (in addition to a better quality standard bun).  Drinks are a bit on the pricey side, but tasty. My daughter says they have the best Peach Bellini."}
{"text":"My favorite place to watch all the games.  Lots of big tvs and they have sound on for one of the games.  Fantastic food and huge apps.  I love the Po Boy but we really can't split an app first or I will not be able to finish my sandwich.  Huge selection of draft beer and that is what i like."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere.   Ali is also a great server.  Very good at what she does.  Passionate about her job.  Good to see in this day and age."}
{"text":"We went to Blue 32 for our daughter's 18th birthday and were pretty disappointed.  The waiter was condescending, but we initially just laughed that off.  Food was ok, nothing really wrong, just not great.  Still within the happy hour window, I ordered their well bourbon on the rocks, advertised as $5 on the menu.  When the bill arrived, I noted that it was $8 and change, so I asked the waiter about it.  He said he would take care of it and came back a few minutes later and said to me sarcastically \"I took that 75 cents off for you,\" like I'm cheap.  When I asked about the 75 cents vs $3+ correction I was expecting, he said rocks pours are always doubles.  Huh?  How about asking me if I want a double?  He was adamant that anytime someone orders rocks, they just automatically charge a double.  Given the small glass crammed full of ice I received, it sure didn't look like a double.  After he left and I was signing the check, we noticed that my wife's salad was $18, when it should have been $11.29 + $2.50 for the added chicken she ordered.  These prices were on the menu, so I have no idea what 'Ace' was keying into the system.  We thought about saying something, but after the first experience in flagging something to our waiter, we decided to vote with our feet and never come back."}
{"text":"Walked in to a set yourself sign, so we did. Shortly after sitting we had help right away. Savvy was our waitress and was very pleasant and did a fantastic job on taking care of our needs. I'm now Gluten Free and it's a little hard so having a menu for that was for helpful. Food was so good!!!! Tasteful, great servings and amazing service. This is definitely on my list of \"to go\" places. Blue 32 have the home town, good food and good people combo. Well done."}
{"text":"Good food especially for a Sports Bar. Tried the calamari  (our kid is into the seafood thing)...it was perfect. Lightly fried with perfect seasoning. Hamburger & Chicken sandwiches were good too!"}
{"text":"Came in here for the first time with some good friends, ordered a lineman burger and fries with a strawberry lemonade.  It was just okay, my wife ordered a 32 blue burger and sweet potatoes fries, her burger was dry. It was worth trying, don't think we will be back again. But the server we had was on point, with refills and asking if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food ! Boneless wings are the best !"}
{"text":"This place is basically a sports bar. It is clean and bright, with affordable food and drink choices. Beers on tap are extensive. The food isn't super amazing, but it's good - what you would expect in a sports bar. I'll stop here any time of day for a drink and everyone seems happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet. I go here all the time, not for the bar or for the drinks but for the buffalo chicken salad. It's my absolute favorite dish in this joints. I tried some other stuff like the burgers they're pretty good and the calamari is usually a good call. I'm personally not too fond of the super nachos but people seem to really like it. Taste buds is what we'll blame that one on. Servers are always friendly and they do a pretty decent job at keeping us topped off with refreshments. It's a good place to grab a bite to eat and if you haven't been there I'd recommend trying the buffalo chicken salad, heck get it with an extra piece of chicken and be just like me."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very very good food. Small portions, not really my style, but the food is damn good. Ordered the over priced boneless wings as an apetizer, and they were very good. Reason I felt they were over priced was because I got like 7 of them. Little tiny wings. Anyways, taste trumped portion. Got the bacon burger. Cooked to perfection. Taste and all was good. Came with fries and again, barely any fries, but very good taste on both items. I'll be back strictly on the amazing taste of their food!!!"}
{"text":"Flaky salmon in the amazing Salmon Salad.  Got great, friendly service from Jake. Plenty of TVs for the football game. Top-notch, classy, clean restrooms. Loved this place."}
{"text":"Blue 32 has the best happy hour around. Most Friday's we come here. We all love the margaritas, nachos, wings, bruschetta, edamame & onion rings. Prices are great, service is A1, & food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. We went on a weekday surprised how busy they were, but service was amazing!! We ordered kids chicken, mild chicken wings, the sirloin steak, fish and chips. Everything was amazing and good enough to come back!!"}
{"text":"Poor food handling practices by bartender observed when she was touching the garnishes with her bare hands. Place has a history of poor hygiene habits as referenced by health inspections. I'll never eat here or go here again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Salmon and ceaser salad was excellent. Ask for Addie, she is a sweet girl girl and excellent server."}
{"text":"We have been here three times now and it has been great! My favorite are the chicken wings extra crispy honey hot. This is my favorite place for wings! I have ordered the steak sandwich which was awesome and the blue burger. If you are looking for a place to have good food with a casual atmosphere check this place out.  The food has been wonderful and it does not taste like it has been bought in. The burger actually was cooked properly, it was moist and delicious! The service was great and they have always been friendly and super attentive without being annoying.  If you haven't tried blue 32 give it a try!"}
{"text":"Myself and a friend headed here after hitting up a movie at the AMC next door and despite the later hour the staff was friendly and warm when we came in.  We were seated in a booth towards the back of the restaurant and the server came up within seconds to take our drink order.    When the waitress returned with our drinks we were ready to order and she was happy to oblige.  I had the mushroom and swiss burger and my friend had the boneless buffalo wings with a side of fries.  The burger was cooked to a darker medium - I usually like medium rare, but I don't remember being asked what temp, so it's probably a standard for the establishment.    As we were finishing up, I requested a to-go order for my fiancee so that he would have something to eat when he got off work.  The waitress had the food out within a couple of minutes, and he really enjoyed the burger and mashed potatoes.  Overall: A Definitely a place we will go back to when in the area!  The staff was really friendly and the food was good - next go around I think I'll get chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"Food is yummy with lots of choices. Love their goat cheese and candied pecan salad. And when you feel like being bad...loaded fries! Good drinks. Kids menu is affordable. Service is good.  Only thing I would change: the chairs are uncomfortable."}
{"text":"What the???? What happened to this place? Seems like poor management to me. Half our order  never came out and the service was terrible. Some friends of the host or hostess came in and got seated way before us and at that point we had been waiting for about 30 minutes. After all this the manager never even came up to our table to give us an explanation of why this happened. From the time I walked in to the time I left I felt like half the employees in this place had better things to do. Blue 32 is a great place normally but this was ridiculous the owners should really take a look at what this place has become...."}
{"text":"I got the buffalo chicken salad. Get it just about every time. Love it! I asked for a side of blue cheese dressing and a side of ranch but it still was a little dry. Maybe ask for a side or two of ranch with yours, but it really is really good!"}
{"text":"Service is great. This is the 3rd time the wings were undercooked. We emphasize \"extra crispy\" but nonetheless they are not crispy. Good place for a drink, not enjoy chicken wings."}
{"text":"its like the usual sports bar nothing special. the food is okay. had the burger once and the chicken pasta both just okay. probably won't be coming back since theres plenty of places that are way better. oh and service is a bit slow. we went for last during lunch time during the week and took a while for our refills and food."}
{"text":"Good food and good service I will recommend to my network of friends. The offerings are simple and tasty."}
{"text":"Great food!!!! You get high quality food at bar speed and at bar prices.  Can't be beat!  We have been coming here since we moved to Gilbert and really haven't had any bad experiences.  The only reason I give them 4 out of 5 stars is due to their beer.  It is always room temp. at best.  They have a very hard time serving cold beer!"}
{"text":"Delicious wings and the ribs were even better.  Staff was friendly and funny to boot!   Black and blue coleslaw sounded better than it was although good.  Chicken avocado sandwich was darkish as well.  Quick service!  Rotating tsp was a MI draft; a small taste of home."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time eating at Blue 32. My parents eat here occasionally, and tonight we ordered takeout. My order was the steak Caesar salad. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. The steak was tough and very overcooked, almost inedible. Also, the salad was already dressed and the lettuce was completely soggy and unappetizing. Normally when I order salads at restaurants to go the dressing is given on the side automatically to avoid this. My mom's meal was also disappointing. She ordered steak (medium) with broccoli. She said the steak was very over done, tough, and chewy. Her broccoli was \"okay\" but over-salted. She also said it was not nearly as good as it usually is. They always order takeout and she orders the same meal. My dad paid $65 for 4 meals, where 2 out of the 4 could not be finished or enjoyed."}
{"text":"Love the food but this place is poorly managed. We tried to go here at 9:15 one night (they close at 10) and we were told at the door they couldn't give us a menu or serve us drinks because it had already been last call. How are you open until 10 if you basically refuse to serve people at 9:15?? That's a very poorly managed restaraunt in my opinion. Obviously they aren't hurting for business, so they won't get anymore of mine."}
{"text":"Shout out to Ashley.   Great bartender and server   You rock!  Never s bad meal.   Best bar food in town. Everything fresh"}
{"text":"Best fried onion rings I've had.  The only thing on their menu I'd eat were the fish tacos.  They were alright.  If they offered the option of changing any of their burgers to a veggie burger, I'd be here at least once a week.  Sports TVs were all over.  Normally I have to sit on the side that can't see the TV because my bf likes to watch sports.  It didn't really matter where you sat, you could see the TV.  That said, they didn't offer the HBO fight between Silva and what's his bucket, so we didn't stay one time.  The time we did stay, the table near us had a screaming kid.  We came in around late lunch time, but this kid was there before we got there and stayed after we left.  He was screaming the whole time.  I wish there was a way to keep screaming kids out of resturaunts, kind of like no smoking, no screaming progeny. Not the resturaunt's fault.  I'll come back when I have a craving for frickin' brilliant onion rings.  Otherwise, not worth it for this pescatarian."}
{"text":"This is a great family-friendly sports bar.  Clean and updated with many new flat screens everywhere makes this a really good place to watch the game.  I've had many things off their menu and would say it is better than your average bar food.  Although they have some great servers, they also have a few that will be more concerned about socializing than keeping your drinks refilled.  Go check this place out and enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is great! We went on a Friday night and it was busy but since we were a party of 2, it went by fast for us. Our server was really cool and sweet to us. We ordered a root beer float, a beer, fish and chips, and a 10oz sirloin all for 40 dollars. Their fish and chips is super good, it's beer battered and has the perfect crunch to it. It was served with cold slaw and French fries but I substitute it for sweet potato fries instead. My bf said the steak had really good flavoring but it has a lot of gilet (which is hard pieces of meat), not the best steak ever. It came with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Overall, it's a great place to for chow down on bar food. It is a loud environment (hence bar) but there are a lot of TVs and a cool place to hang. Will come again!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. My only wish is that they did military discount other than that it was awesome experience. The food was cooked to perfection at least for a sports bar it gets no better. It was more than expected! The lemon drop was strong yet flavorful and the strawberry margarita was refreshing tasting of fresh fruit. The ribs were falling off the bone Tip: get honey BBQ sauce the Monte Cristo was the best I had in Az even better than Cheesecake Factory... we will be back for sure... only negative was waitress seemed to be over booked working outside tables too so she disappeared"}
{"text":"Have been here several times and never disappointed by the food.  Great Happy Hour specials from 3pm until 7pm.  Would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Went to this place with high hopes that is would be a place I want to come back to, only to be disappointed. The wait staff was great but the food was mediocre. Our plates were not very warm for ordering hot food and the food was pretty plain. The biggest let down was this is supposed to be a sports bar but they have one of the worse selections of beer I have seen in a long time. Good if you like the plain bud light and colors light and only about 6 taps... definitely not a place I will hurry back to."}
{"text":"Ok, so I wasn't expecting a 5 star dining experience in a sports bar environment, but since I was entertaining out of town guests, this is where they wanted to go.  I ordered the salmon salad.  While it wasn't the best I've had, it was probably the worst.  Halfway through eating it, I discovered that the salmon was not cooked all the way.  Disgusted, I brought it to the attention of our server who then got the manager.  Once the manager admitted that it should be cooked longer, he presented me with the option of  bringing me another or taking it off the bill.  I opted to have it removed from my bill as I lost my appetite at that point.  Fast forward to the next day when glancing at my receipt.  They left it on the bill and charged me anyway.  I blame myself as well for not checking it over before leaving the restaurant.  It is unlikely I will ever return here."}
{"text":"Blue 32 is one of my go to spots. My girlfriend and I love the fries. However the serves can be spotty. Also if they are busy, the fries usually are soggy. Other than that, the place is awesome!"}
{"text":"We came up from Tucson to furniture shop and asked the associates at the furniture store where they recommended getting lunch.  They all said Blue 32 was excellent and they were right!  We enjoyed our lunch and the nice service."}
{"text":"Picked up lunch yesterday and was pretty disappointed. I had the turkey reuben and a friend had the chicken strips. The turkey reuben was nothing like a reuben besides having swiss cheese and being on marbled rye- no sauerkraut or thousand island. I was pretty disappointed with the reuben and definitely would not order it again. Also I asked for bbq sauce and it's probably my fault not for double checking that it was in the bag but I got home and they just put in ketchup and ranch. Food has been better when I've eaten there so maybe I'll stick with that from now on."}
{"text":"I just moved to Gilbert from Snobsdale.  Yes I said Snobsdale!  I was pleasantly surprised by Blue 32!!!  This place would even do great is Snobsdale!!  (the people in Scottsdale are quite critical, hence one of the reasons I am in Gilbert raising my family now.)  This was so unexpected!  Great food, great decor, price was MUCH cheaper than comprable place in Scottsdale!  My wife couldn't believe it either.  PLeasantly surprised...I lived in gilbert from 1997-2003 and there was no decent eateries, sports bars or anything that was't a chain.  Glad to be back folks and I will be coming back to Blue 32 often!!  My 10 and 11 year old boys were even talking about our hot waitres...LOL!  GREAT SPOT!!"}
{"text":"Ended up here due to not getting in anywhere for the UFC fight, wish they carried it here but they don't.  Made the best of a situation, it was crowded here too so chose the patio, it was hot out the misters do a great job.  The menu is really random with some really good stuff on it.  I went for the baby back ribs, pretty picky about how tasty and meaty my ribs are.  These are excellent, very meaty and fall of the bone tender.  The baked beans were also quite good.  Prices are very reasonable as well.  Will definitely be going back to try other menu items.  Waitress and the Hostess was also very friendly."}
{"text":"It's nice to have something close. The waiting and bar staff are always on point, sometimes the door staff aren't, but they do get very very busy... good food. Decent prices. Interesting drinks!"}
{"text":"Went for my son's birthday and had a great experience. I had a chicken cobb salad that was both huge in portion size and delicious. My son and husband had the Monte Crispo. They both raved about how delicious it was. My son ordered onion rings which had a pepper like taste to them. He enjoyed the onion more than usual, and my hubby's fries were perfectly crisp. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"My fave place to bring work clients for a dinner meeting. Lots of TV's and the food is always good. The staff is friendly and I've never had bad service. Everyone is polite and has a smile on their face. Highly, highly recommend this place over Lucky Lou's or Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers located down the street."}
{"text":"Great fresh food, the chick fried chicken breast with white gravy is Awesome. we have had most everything now and it's far above expectations of bar food, in fact it's great food, great service and great prices."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Do not go here! Especially for Happy Hour! We do not need anyone else finding out about this place! Honestly, if there is one bad thing about this spot - it is that it is so good that it's becoming really really popular , especially during happy hour. This is probably due to great appetizers and specials on them, good drinks and draft selection, and very friendly and attentive employees. It truly can be challenging finding a parking place and a seat at the bar, but it was well worth it in my view. I'm hoping their next East Valley location will help spread out the clientele in the area. Everything we have had during happy hour is always great, from cheese fries to Buffalo shrimp to Calamari and more. (Just please don't tell anyone!)"}
{"text":"Been there 4x now for lunch and so far it has been consistently good food and service. Good size proportions for the sandwiches, salads, and the fries are crispy.  The Cuban, Pastrami, Steak sandwiches, and Fish n Chips have all been pretty good. Lots of TVs with many sports to choose from but not too loud."}
{"text":"Everything here is very average. The food is average, the service is average, the drinks are average. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come and we actually prefer Harvey's next door if we are over this way. Our wait time for our appetizer was pretty long and it ended up coming out with our food. Not the biggest problem but I was hungry before my meal, that's why we ordered an app. Oh well, maybe someday we'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's not a 5 star restaurant, it's not on a beach, or anything special, but it's one of the best places in Gilbert. Food is reliably fresh, clean, properly cooked, and always tastes great.   As good as the food is, the wait staff is the absolute best. To name a few, Josh, Kyle, Alison, and Natalie are some of the friendliest and most prompt servers I've ever had. Seriously, we come here because of how great the people are.  My recommendation: Chicken and Avocado Club with Blackened Chicken"}
{"text":"Great food & the bar is a fun place to watch sports games! Usually there is a wait for dinner on weekends. Would recommend Blue 32 for sure!"}
{"text":"Tried Blue 32 for the first time because of the positive Yelp reviews. So glad I did!  Fun atmosphere!  Great for couples or families. Had the Salmon salad - it was delicious!  Also, the loaded French fries are so good. Mixed drinks were very good also!  Our server was friendly and very attentive!  I will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place! We go twice a week and have never been disappointed with our food or service."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced, conveniently located for the neighborhoods near Higley and Chandler Heights, and a good happy hour.  Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food great atmosphere server \"Ace\" is attentive but not pushy.   First time here and not disappointed.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Meh. Bar food. Greasy. Our server would disappear for long periods of time and it took her about 20 minutes to bring us our beer."}
{"text":"Popped in here after walking out of Harvey's next door.  Couldn't have been more different; attentive service, fun atmosphere, good food and appropriate for all ages (our grand-kids were with us!).  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day with a friend.  It was my first time here and  I will definitely be back!!! I had the grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  I am not even a broccoli fan and I ate that first.  The chicken was awesome, moist, carmelized -- totally yummy.  It was the best lunch I have had in a long time.  My friend had the fish and chips - another major thumbs up.  We didn't drink, so can't comment on the beers, but really enjoyed the food and the staff was very friendly - will definitely be here again.  I would also advise trying to get in on off peak hours.  This place always seems to have a bunch of cars outside especially lunch and after work!!!"}
{"text":"It's sad to review this place and give it 2 stars knowing that it really has potential to be 4+. The inside of this place is beautiful, very clean, and very open. I ordered a burger here which was okay(nothing amazing), the fries were extremely greasy---but then again it's a sports bar, so no complaints there. However, being charged 8.50 for a side greek salad was kind of out of the ordinary. This place is very pricey for a sports bar, I know it's a nice area... But sheesh, the costs for medium quality food isn't something I like to attend often. What really hurt is the service. My server came by our table a total of two times for the TWO hours I was there. My party ordered two burgers and a flatbread pizza which took an hour just to get there. Who knew being the only group in the restaurant would make the chefs go extra slow. Kind of frustrating. Nonetheless, this place has potential, they just have to step up their game. I probably won't come here again for quite a while."}
{"text":"I typically don't like sports bars and grills like these, but that was about to change when I tried blue!  The grilled chicken breast was awesome!  The mashed potatoes were a steakhouse-like quality!  Overall good service and good atmosphere!  Go here if you like Buffalo Wild Wings!"}
{"text":"They have some of the best food around town. Great variety of food and drinks. We are they at least once a week. The service is reason number we go there. Ask for Dalice when you go in there, she is simply amazing! Job well done."}
{"text":"Our local go to restaurant! Clean, good service and easy to find something that everyone likes."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy... my opinion on Blue 32 has changed since my review 3 years ago. I love this place. I'm there at least 3x/month and NOT just because it's so close to my house. Their nachos are my favorite.... yes, my favorite... anywhere. The ground beef has so much frickin' flavor. Nom!   Another favorite is the boneless wings. If they had a \"Boneless Wings Anonymous\", I think I'd be forced to attend. The wings at Blue 32 live up to my standards.   The service has always been great as well. It gets busy during happy hour and all sports games, so come early if you don't want to wait awhile for a table. The bar area is open seating, so stalk those tables when you walk in."}
{"text":"We come here once a week on average. Everything on the menu is OUTSTANDING! Great service - great local place to grab something good to eat at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, but a little pricey.    Most of their food is worthy of four stars, they have a decent beer selection and know how to pour, and the service is good.  Considering their prices though, I have to give them more of an average rating.  I go here regularly because I live nearby, but I wouldn't drive very far out of my way for Blue 32.    I do really enjoy the 32 flat screen TVs.  It's a cool place to watch sports.   I recommend the tacos, the sliders, and the nachos."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I had the Blackened Shrimp Tacos, a new favorite. One of our party had the salmon and loved it the other had the pastrami sliders which were amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place to catch the game! Food, service, and atmosphere are always on point. Josh and crew are always professional and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing EVERY time we have been.  Great service and even better food.  The nachos are amazing. One of my favorites was the mahi mahi tacos. Another favorite that I have had was their steak tacos! Definitely. Great place. But on their peak times it can be a long wait."}
{"text":"Pretty cool sports bar with great TV coverage, had a party of 12 so did apps and hordevres. Drinks were good but a little pricey and need better selection on whiskey."}
{"text":"Service fast and excellent so far. Cheeseburgers have good quality and flavor. Baked beans are wonderful, great smokey flavor.   Burger was cooked the way I asked for it. Medium. Ice tea kept full by attentive server.   I'll come back."}
{"text":"Good food... Good beer... Great atmosphere. Lots of TVs ;)  *** It's football season and if you don't get their early in game day you may wait for a long time. Although an outside seat seem to be readily available.  1) Had the Spinach and artichoke dip... Which is not so good. Just a big bowl of cheese goop.., not much spinach or artichoke. Very salty and not pleasant to eat. Sent it back and got more wings.  2) Chicken wings ( regular with bones ) are awesome. Very tasty  3) Good selection of Beer  Also great place to wait before or after movie"}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner tonight. When its just my 18 year-old and I eating out, we try to find a place that specifically accommodates her dietary issues (otherwise she just gets salads typically). I read that Blue 32 has a gluten free menu so we decided to give it a shot. Not only do they have a separate gluten-free menu, but the waiter was patient in discussing what my daughter could eat from it (she can't do dairy, onions or garlic either...).  The clincher was how someone came from the back to discuss it further, we ended up having to change some things. My daughter got the blackened shrimp tacos and loved them. I enjoyed the ribs and wings, not the most amazing (a bit over cooked for my taste), but we had a fantastic time.  I was so happy with the service and attention to my daughter's needs that this place gets 5 stars. Not only did they provide food she could eat, they were very cool about it, and didn't make my daughter uncomfortable.     I see the reviews about it being loud/crowded, but to me thats a typical sports bar. Lots of TVs here with options, will be fun taking my wife here and sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Food was really good American Fare. Place is very clean and not too noisy.  My girl has a new love affair with a \"Dirty Pear\" (Pear Cider topped with Guiness Draft). Even though not on the menu, they knew what it was, and happily made it for us!  We got an order of hot wings, which were good and meaty and even hot!  My girl ordered the Black & Bleu Burger. Asked for it cut, since we planned on sharing, and they brought it divided on two plates and didn't charge any splitting fee (good job).  We also shared an order of fish and chips.  The food was great. Maybe a lil on the pricey side...$12.99 for the fish & chops and $10.99 for the burger.  But it was all great! Including the Black & Bleu Coleslaw and Loaded Fries (upgrade on the burger entree).   Our server was prompt, friendly and never had us waiting, wondering or thirsty. And to me, that is crucial to a good review!  Minus 1 star because of the price. One dirty pear, diet coke, wings, burger, fish & chips (during happy hour) came to $45. So take that with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"This is our go to place in Gilbert when we want to grab dinner. It's close by and the food is always hot and delicious! I personally like the buffalo chicken wrap and the burgers. My family frequently get the ribs and the monte cristo.  Only 4 stars because sometimes the service isn't be the best- but it's never been horrible!"}
{"text":"Good Food, good service. Our waiter, Regal. Was very very nice and very attentive. Yummy fish & chips."}
{"text":"I love watching football at sports bars. Went last week for MNF and was happy with my choice.   Yes it was packed. Yes it was loud. But it's Monday. Football. What do you expect?   Our server was friendly and helpful. Got our happy hour orders in quickly. Beer was yummy and cold... perfect.   For food we ordered lots of different apps. I agree this is better than average bar food. Chips and queso were deelish. We had 2 orders. Also had calamari, buffalo shrimp, fries, sweet potato fries, and a salad. I feel like we had something else but I don't remember. That is a result of the cold yummy beer haha.   All really, really good. I'll go back and maybe sit in the bar part. Fun place. If I have one gripe it's that they don't have one main tv screen. But there are so many that basically anywhere you sit has a view of any game.  Good times."}
{"text":"True sports bar with TV screens on all corners and great food choice."}
{"text":"There are few fine dining establishments within a 10 mile radius, so Blue 32 gets a 4 star rating for being best in class of anything nearby.  Great food, excellent service and good atmosphere all lend to a fun night out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and fresh food! Love the new location. Football season will be a lot of fun. Try the bacon and blue burger. You will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"Neither exciting well it was boring bartenderess was there wasn't very interactive...boring food was fair yet I've been coming for years it's boring if you sit at the bar you expect an interactive bartender not my best visit!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service on a slow night. The food was served at room temperature. Worst. Sports. Bar. Ever. Good should be served at more than room temp..."}
{"text":"First of all, this is a sports bar and you should expect as much going in. That said, as sports bars go, this one earns all 5 stars. My husband and I come here pretty often, and we are never disappointed. The service is always excellent and the food is consistent and good. Lately I've been having a love affair with fish tacos, and the Mahi tacos here are awesome. My husband usually gets a burger or the buffalo chicken flat-bread, and he is always happy. One thing I really appreciate about this place is that as far as I can tell, the food tastes like it was made from scratch. It's not like typical bar food that moved right from the freezer to fryer. They put a little more effort than most into the food, and you can taste the difference. Is it crowded? Sometimes. Is it loud? Usually. Is it worth a try? Absolutely. ."}
{"text":"There are a lot of TVs at this place.  The TVs are playing sports of all different kinds.  If you are into this kind of thing, you will love it.  Thank God I am into this kind of thing.  The food is pretty good and above average for a sports bar.  The staff is very nice and best of all, my wife doesn't mind hanging here for awhile. They seem pretty busy and I am glad folks are supporting locals in their business."}
{"text":"As far as sports bars go, this is a very good one. The food is good, fresh, and made by people (not defrosted and reheated like many sports bars). The service is friendly and there are TVs everywhere. It's a little pricier than you'd expect but worth it for the quality you receive."}
{"text":"We were craving fish n' chips today....so yelp'd it...Blue 32 Sports Grill came up and we finally decided it was time to try this restaurant thats super closer to our home.  We both ordered the fish and chips - the fish was beer battered and cooked to perfections. The fries were also delicious. I really enjoyed the coleslaw as well :)   Overall our first experience was great! We can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"i have tried to eat here 3 times, all around 4:30pm.  My dink in rating is not because of them.  There has been a 20 to 30 minute wait (even when I was alone) so I walked out and went to Zipps across the street.  Crowd is good but if the seating is that slow my experience is so is the service normally.  I give up, no need to try for a $14 burger again.  Wish you the best"}
{"text":"This place has the best food for a sports bar. I have never had anything from here that was bad. The Salmon Salad is a favorite. The waitresses and bar tenders always have a smile, keep the drinks flowing and quick to bring out my food. Never wait very long at all to have my order taken. All managers are walking around and checking the guests for their satisfaction. This is my go to bar and have no desire to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went there last week, was very impressed. Food was really good. I had pastrami sandwich. The atmosphere was really upbeat. Lots of people having a good time. It will be a regular handout."}
{"text":"Very good. I got the grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Delicious! My husband's been here twice and liked everything he's gotten. The only think I'd say against it is it's loud, but that's a sports grill for you"}
{"text":"We came here to watch the Draft, we had good service- the girl came around about every half hour (so that could have been bette)- but enough to get us our drinks, which were great, apps, which were also so good, and we enjoyed our time here! We'd come again for sure!!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and it's always good. There have been a couple of times we've had to wait to be seated at odd times, but they've done well flipping tables while not making us feel rushed. My husband always orders the Wing Burger and absolutely loves it. I've ordered several different items and have always been pleased. The Chips and Queso and Bruschetta are really good as well and both have their own uniqueness. They also have a bunch of beers on tap, which is always nice!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, great drinks and the food is very good. Yet to have a bad meal here!! Staff is super cool, try the brushetta!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and service. Get the black and bleu burger"}
{"text":"This is a staple in our lives on a weey basis.  We love the food and the atmosphere.   Great people and we get taken care of above and beyond.  Love the 32!"}
{"text":"This is a weekly thing for my family.  We feel at home and the food and service is amazing.  Watching the game and or just after the game... it's a score fo sho!   Love the 32!"}
{"text":"First things first, happy hour menu and prices is awesome! We started with Calamari and Boneless wings, good portions for happy hour. We love coming here because there's hardly any wait and food is consistent. I give it 3 stars because parking sucks and calamari could use less pepper."}
{"text":"I love that this location is really close to my house. Really good happy hour food. Calamari appetizer fried perfectly, but the pepper needs to get toned down a notch or two. Food portions are great, even good enough for sharing."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want really great food and a casual place to hang with family or friends and talk!  This is my go-to. It is only a few minutes from home. The first time I went, the waitress was so kind to my youngest son. She brought him the bottled root beer and his eyes lit up. He sat a little taller and felt grown up! We enjoy this place after my boy's games or concerts and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Came here's during happy hour on a Friday and it was slammed! Fortunately you can check in via Yelp which was super helpful and saved a 30 minute wait.  Lots of tv's all around, great spot to watch any sporting event... hopefully they show a lot of Packers games :)"}
{"text":"My party of five went here on Saturday afternoon. It was a sports Grill atmosphere with TVs playing sports and loud conversations all around me. Thankfully, we broke the monotony and were loudest of all.  We had a great time. Our waitress was very patient with us as we sampled many spirits and appetizers. I really enjoyed being here more so than the one over in Santan Village. The artichoke dip is amazing. Also, we ordered medium wings and they tasted fantastic. That may be the spirits talking, but we're definitely coming back either way!"}
{"text":"We started out by grabbing a drink at the bar tonight it was around 5 so not busy yet all. Bartender greeted us right away and took our drink orders. After he served us our beers he literally disappeared! I dug up enough cash to leave for our tab and we moved outside to the \"open seating area\" we sat there for at least 20 mins if not 30 with no greeting no nothing from anyone. I went up to server area and asked if we could get menus and a server  and got such attitude from the young lady with purpley hair pulled up with a bow in back. I should have left! Service after that was still bad server kept disappearing. My steak tacos and rice were so salty I couldn't eat them. But couldn't find her even to tell her. I won't be back to this location I will drive to Val Vista."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints for me! We got there right before happy hit ended so we were able to get our drinks at the Happy Hour price. Recommend the Buffalo chicken salad, great for something light but satisfying.   We had Kyle and he was great and efficient!"}
{"text":"It helps to get a waiter that understands you don't like spicy foods!!! I ordered the Shrimp Po' boy and onion rings. Our waiter said that he would make sure that no spices were added to the batter for my order.. it was excellent!!  Blue 32 did not skimp on the shrimp. They were fresh and plentiful!! I will definitely be going back!! Have to try a few more things on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Classics sports bar the way it should be done, great food, great beer, plenty of tvs Great place for lunch, dinner or happy hour"}
{"text":"While the Spinach Artichoke dip is TO DIE FOR (seriously the perfect cheesy bread dip combination!) the service at lunch is TERRIBLE. A co-worker & I recently went for lunch and had the dip & potato soup. We asked for them to come together as we had to go back to work after eating. The dip came out first which was fine... but we completely finished it before the soup came out. The soup came out 25 mins after we ordered and it tasted OK, but was lukewarm. I asked for the check and it took another 15 minutes to actually get it. It wasn't at all busy, there was 2 people at the bar & maybe 3 other tables... 2 servers, 2 bussers/hosts, and a bartender. A little disappointed in the service, but the food was good. Probably wouldn't go when it's actually busy considering."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  Always have a good meal and great service.  Not typical Bar food!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the bar tenders and waitresses are great.   I just went there for dinner with some friends.  I had the pesto chicken pasta and it was fantastic. I also tried my friends wings that were great as well. It was a lot of fun to hang out there, but the prices for the beers were a bit much. If I went during happy hour, perhaps I would have been more drunk and more willing to pay $43 bucks (w/o tip) for 4 drinks and my dinner.   Obviously I went there for dinner, so there weren't many sports games to be played on the 500 TVs (yes, this is a slight exaggeration, but there are a lot) in the bar. I'd imagine this place would be a BLAST to go to during football season. I'll have to give it a shot then."}
{"text":"We used to go to other two locations and they were also very good. However this place is closer to us and they are awesome. They did a great job of bringing folks from the other places to train and smooth our the typical grand opening bumps.  We are so glad this place opened up. Not only for the convenience of being near our home, but it is also right next door to our favorite movie theatre.  Love the cold beers as well as service is awesome just like the other places.  Quick update as now they have been in business for a little bit...... we still really like place. All the servers are very good and tonight we were lucky enough to have Julie again.  She is awesome. Very attentive and has a great personality to boot, but most importantly really good at her job!!  We also love the Deschutes Fresh Squeezed and this location carries it so big bonus points for that. We are hoping that the closure of the north Phoenix location does not impact the service, atmosphere and teamwork of this location.  We love the East Valley vibe out here and hope it continues."}
{"text":"Good selection of food and beer.  Everything we have had is fresh, particularly the i house elf dressings.  Love the blue cheese. Burgers, sandwiches and BBQ all good.  Most importantly great service.  Especially Kyle!"}
{"text":"We recently visited during auto show weekend and am impressed with this place! It was packed, but they moved people quickly and efficiently. The service was great and the food good.  The buffalo chicken wrap is awesome! The french fries are big and well seasoned and the beer is cold.  Lots of TV watching for sports and events. Will visit again soon"}
{"text":"The only complaint I have is when I ask if they have ginger ale, they say yes, then went and mixed coke and sprite together and gave it to me like I wouldn't know the difference.That's not ginger ale and that's gross. However, I cannot stop eating the blackened chicken pasta. Omg, it's so good. Shrimp tacos are also excellent. Desserts are also delicious (get the cookie)."}
{"text":"Mainstream sports bar with a typical menu. The decor is nice and the food is well balanced. French fries are crispy and delicious, and their ice tea was surprisingly delicious."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice sports bar that is a step up from Natives or Buffalo Wild wings, this is your place.  Natives and BWW are nice when you want the down and dirty bare bones experience like in your college days for wings and such.  But now you're not in college, time to upgrade your sports bar and palate. LOTS of TV with lots of channels for sports.  Big bar area with TVs or booth seating for just family dining.  The menu for food is impressive, the burgers are big and juicy, wings are ok. fries are ok.  But they have just a big menu for everything and the quality tastes just better then Natives or BWW.  The beer selection is good, and for mixed drinks they're decent.  And its CLEAN!  Pros: -LOTS OF TVS (think wall to wall) -good food (esp the burgers) -big selections of beer -spacious bar and regular dining area  Cons: -CLOSES AT EARLY (or earlier than most) - gets very crowded during big games so there might be a wait -parking lot can get full real quick"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for Happy Hour. I liked the vibe and the waiter was fast.  Ordered the wings had them mix honey and buffalo together. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"We always love coming here and haven't had a bad experience that has made us not want to come back. Their menu is so diverse that everyone is able to find something that they will love. Their environment is family friendly but also has a bar area and there are plenty of TVs so that everyone has a great view of any games that are on!  My husband and I love the buffalo chicken salad and it is large enough to share. Other favorites of ours are the ribs, the country fried chicken, and many of their appetizers. Their fries I think are battered and fried to perfection and I love them! One of my favorite restaurants and we come here often!"}
{"text":"the server totally gave us the happy hour prices on our first round even though we rolled in at like 19:01 which instantly wins my vote.  my wife was very pleased with how well lit and clean the whole place was, and the food was a cut above what you'd expect for a sports bar.  definitely going to try here again because the lunch specials look great!"}
{"text":"liked the location around the San tan mall and this one is just as awesome. definitely more geriatrics at this one but way better seating and much shorter wait times. I guess to offset the blue hairs they hire exclusively high school girls to serve, but the visual drama this schism creates (the ravenous dead being served by the vitality of youth) only enhances your dining experience.  also they have a ton of local microbrews all on draft"}
{"text":"What a breath of fresh air Blue 32. The food is superb. The staff, well trained and friendly and, there are about thirty screens featuring every type of sporting event known to man, except for curling or water polo.  Try this. Order a kobe beef hot dog and a small cup of chili on the side, it makes for one damned fine chili dog.  Now a beer. And some sweet potato fries. And the black and blue cole slaw. Another beer. Then three more.  Now flirt with the waitress because she was so interested in the movie you just went to see at the nearby Harkins theatre, forgetting your wife is seated across from you. Another beer.  Now a cab, since your wife took the car keys AND the car. In my defense, the waitress was totally hot and my balls still tend to function at Homeland Security's level Orange after five twenty ounce drafts.   We may not be going back for a while, but that doesn't mean you can't. Try to get seated in a station where the server isn't so damned hot and friendly.  Took one star off for the cab ride home and the silent treatment for two days, while my balls were safely returning to Defense Level Blue."}
{"text":"Won't ever go here again.  The appetizers were really good, nacho, bruschetta and onion rings.  My burger was ok but the bacon was raw.  The fries had to many crammed in a basket so there were some that were crispy and most weren't.  The majority of them were not fully cooked inside.    Our server was so bad we went in at 645 (with 2 children age 2 and under) and left at 830. There were only 4 other tables in there on a Monday night.  Common sense tells you that a table with small children will most likely want to leave shortly after finishing but no, after clearing half the plates she disappeared for another 15 minutes. Then it took what felt like another 10 minutes for her to return with the checks!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour-palooza! Not your typical, sub-par, TGI-Gross type appetizers, either! Come hungry (but not hangry) and leave happy!  My family and I visited Blue 32 over the holidays, it's a great place to meet up with family and friends that are otherwise hard to see. Although we all arrived at separate times, the staff was gracious enough to let some of us reserve a booth while waiting for others to arrive (this may not be the case if they're super busy). Thankfully? all of us didn't arrive until after Happy Hour had started at 3PM.   Happy Hour times are from 3-7PM Monday through Friday.  Here's a breakdown of their deals per their website:  FOOD $5.00 - Edamame, Fried Pickles, Onion Rings, Chips & Queso $6.00 - Bruschetta, Loaded Fries $7.00 - Nachos, Buffalo Shrimp, Calamari, Wings DRINKS $3.50 - Bud Light, Coors Light, Miller Lite $4.00 - Frozen Ritas, Frozen Sangria, Baja Wave $4.50 - Sierra Nevada, Blue Moon, Shiner Bock, Dos XX Lager, Left Hand Pilsner, Stella Artois, Wyders Pear Cider $5.00 - Guinness (20oz), House White, House Red $5.50 - Tito's Specialty Martinis, Tito's Vodka Cocktails *they also had a happy hour discount on well cocktails, though I don't remember what they cost.  We ordered several appetizers to share: the nachos, an order of wings, and onion rings. Those who arrived early had already devoured a non-happy hour order of boneless wings. Everything that we ordered was absolutely phenomenal.   The nachos are top-notch (get it, nachos? top notch? snort). The toppings sing high above other chain restaurants. They use queso blanco. I die. Plenty of jalapenos, meat and cheese to cover each chip. And they're piled high!   The onion rings were a big favorite. They batter actually sticks to the onion, so you don't get that slimy string of onion pulling out from the crispy exterior. The batter is also peppery, like in a really delicious way, but if you're sensitive to black pepper, better to avoid this. We asked for a side of ranch and honestly, the 'rings didn't last long.   The wings were also good, though \"less good\" than the other two dishes. We opted for \"medium\" heat and they were more than manageable for the sensitive among our group. The skin was a bit floppy, not crisp like I prefer, and could have used a few more minutes in the fryer, IMO.   My well cocktail was a heavy pour, and for that, I was grateful. Who doesn't need a strong drink when around family for the holidays?  Their regular menu is expansive (almost ridiculously so), but for those looking for the most bang for your buck, definitely go for Blue 32's happy hour. Easily the best I've been to in recent memory! Looking forward (??) to another family holiday \"meeting\" here, where I can perchance bribe family members into ordering the hand-breaded calamari..."}
{"text":"Brand new, great atmosphere to watch sports with very good food - ribs, steaks and seafood to sandwiches and salads."}
{"text":"Food is excellent for a sports bar. An old favorite of ours especially when we can bring our dog with us and sit in the patio. Full bar or your favorite beer."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience tonight. I will never go back. Terrible food and service. Long waits, cold food and the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  $50 down the toilet... and yes, pun intended. This place is a toilet."}
{"text":"Good place for happy hour.  Secret is to call ahead for seating as this place is always busy when we go.    They offer a bunch of food items and decent alcohol drinks for happy hour.  We tried most of them but our favorite are the nachos and buffalo shrimp.  A heaping serving of ground beef and chips covered in queso.  They top it with olives, jalapeno's, and sour cream.  The buffalo shrimp are better than what they serve at the chicken place that rhymes with footers.  My kids are wing fans so they always get the 10 wings special on the happy hour menu.  The restaurant is clean and a sports fanatic heaven with multiple large screen TV's.  Parking sucks and they are always packed but that is because of the food and service."}
{"text":"I was at shopping center at the 101 and Scottsdale Road with my five month old daughter. She needed a change of her diaper and was hungry and I needed to use the facilities and somehow warm her bottle.   We stopped in and asked to sit at a booth. The host was very helpful and allowed me to place my daughters carrier in the booth a leave the stroller in front of the table.  The server was also accommodating and brought me a warm water to heat the milk in my daughter's bottle. I ordered 6 hot buffalo wings -grilled and then took my daughter to the bathroom to change her and relieve my bladder. There was a changing station in the men's room and it was also very clean.  When I returned the bottle was ready and my daughter began to feed. The wings shortly came out and after finishing her bottle, my daughter took a nap.   The wings were awesome. Don't get me wrong, I think most sports bars have a similar tasting order of wings with a variation of Frank's Red Hot sauce. These were different.   First, I love grilled wings. After they are cooked, char them in the grill and they will give you a great grilled flavor. Second, the sauce had a little more zip, was possibly mustard based(?)but just enough heat to be tasty. I would love to find out more about this sauce. Third, the server was great; she helped get me set up and was super nice. I had a great lunch and a great experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. So happy they've added this location. Nice to have a new, great food and sports bar choice south of the 202.  I've had nearly every sandwich on the menu. They are all fantastic.  One of the few places to get a Monte Christo. Trust me, it's worth the extra time you'll need in the gym, to work off the delicious extra calories. One thing I've ordered with every sandwich is the Black and Blue Coleslaw.  Best coleslaw I've had anywhere west of the Carolinas.  The chips and queso are a great way to start your meal too."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with my mom. We were sat right away, and our server came to the table almost immediately. The food was tasty, and pretty big portions (even mom's plate which was off the lunch menu was huge).  Fast friendly service! In past visits, service wasn't always stellar (could've even considered it as bad).... But today we had a good experience. I'm happy we gave them another shot!"}
{"text":"Good for Sunday football but the food is so eh. I have been here several times. I have ordered salads, hamburgers, appetizers, sandwiches, and tacos. Nothing is ever more than \"meh\". Visiting Blue 32 is always a shrug your shoulders \"it was okay\" experience. I am still giving it three stars because their drinks are good and the servers try very hard to make it an enjoyable experience. Their TV layouts are very organized for NFL games."}
{"text":"Food is always pretty good, decent variety of sandwiches and burgers. The wait is always the deciding factor - it can be pretty bad at times. Stopped in on a Wednesday night at 7pm and there were quiet a few people waiting already. We got lucky and grabbed bar table tonight while the bus boy was cleaning it. Service is good and everything comes out in a normal timeframe. We'll be back and we've just gotten used to the wait at the door."}
{"text":"Tried the Scottsdale location with a co-worker of mine..... Food was AVERAGE at best.  Had the shrimp po-boy and he had black and blue burger.  His burger came out well done.  YUCK.  When he brought it up to server, she said all of our burgers are prepared medium well.  Would have been great if she stated that or asked when he ordered.  In all fairness she did offer to re order it.  We had to get going so he declined.  Dont think I will go back, too many options in this part of town with far superior food."}
{"text":"Thank goodness the food was good!  Because our waiter actually \"whined\" about our growing group size and how it was too hard for him to keep track of our food n drink!!!  Yeah, he was complaining that we had more people coming in to eat there, in your already NOT very busy restaurant.  Oh and btw, get some propane for your patio heaters!  Guess we wi have to go back to Native New Yorker for our happy hours, cuz they were much more accommodating and didn't \"whine\" at us."}
{"text":"They're closed. Out of business. Same thing happened to buffalo wild wings four years ago in the same spot. Closed up without any advance notice. Just taped up the windows and skipped town."}
{"text":"This is an above average sports bar/restaurant. There are tons of TVs showing sports even at the booths. The happy hour is good and their nachos were delicious.  They are also relatively cheap without compromising on the taste of their food."}
{"text":"This was. The better place and then they got comfortable. And it's the run of the mill chilis 2 orders now completely incorrect go 5 min down the road it gets better"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food and friendly staff. We will be coming back often. Prices were typical for a bar and grills and the portion sizes were perfect."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of our favorite local spots! Great service friendly staff. Everything we have ordered has been good! The Tacos al Carbon, Baked Potato Soup and Blue 32 steak sandwich are some of my favorites. I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I've gotten carryout twice in the last week. That should tell you how yummy this place is! I've never dined in but my order is always ready and cooked to perfection when I pick it up. They've also never forgotten anything (I hate going home only to find something missing) My favorite is their ribeye steak with their home style mashed potatoes and Caesar salad."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.   I just moved to Gilbert and have been scouring the area for good please to eat, drink, and be merry. I can pretty much do all 3 here.   I went last night during happy hour and sat at the bar seeing I was alone. I wasn't very impressed with the choices on the happy hour menu but I ordered the boneless buffalo chicken wings with honey hot sauce and they were very delicious. All 8 pieces were very thick and juicy.   I also ordered a few house margaritas on the rocks but unfortunately only \"frozen\" margaritas were part of happy hour. I kinda wish the bartender had pointed this out, but it doesn't really matter because she made each drink perfectly.   I took every ones suggestions and ordered the Philly Cheese Steak which was very good. a little smaller than I expected yet packed with steak which was seasoned very well. Only real complaint about the sandwich is that I wish they mixed the cheese in with the steak rather than simply placing the steak on top of the cheese. next time I will ask them to mix it in.   The fries that came with the meal were also very good. Almost like a flatter version of a steak fry. Looked to be fresh as some still had the skin on them.   The prices were fairly high but they are not so high that it would prevent me from coming here again. It's still cheaper than Boston, MA (Where I just moved from). It seems like it would be a great place to watch a sporting even with a couple of buddies or even taking the girlfriend out on a quiet Wednesday night.   Conversation at the bar with the bartender and patrons was fantastic as well. very personable people."}
{"text":"This place is a regular for my husband and I whenever we are in Gilbert. The food is pretty good. If you are looking to watch a game, this is definitely a good place for that. There are numerous TVs displaying various games so I'm sure you will be able to see what ever game you're looking to see."}
{"text":"I wish I could write a review on how the food was, but I didn't even get that far. A friend and I went in this past Saturday and were seated right away. It wasn't too busy (maybe 4-5 tables and a lot of people around the bar area), so we figured we would get service pretty quickly. Our server did come by quickly and took our drink orders (just water). When she came back she asked if we were ready to order and we told her we needed a few minutes- that's the last we saw of her. We waited 28 minutes until finally getting up and leaving. I don't know if she completely forgot about us or if she was annoyed that we needed more time to think about what to order. Either way it was a bad enough experience that I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"nice new location. Good food, good atmosphere, good servers. thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place! Came here on a weekday night to have a few drinks with my boyfriend and his friends. Nice area, open, dinning area is separate from the bar area. They had a nice patio outside for smoking, cool bar decor, nice and clean. The staff was friendly and the food was good. I had the mushroom burger and fries. The buns are huge and toasted, the burger was cooked a little too much, but still had flavor and the fries were good. They do have happy hour on the week days and run a few different specials. Found a neat new place to hang out and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"I really like the layout of this place, the bar area is spacious, not cramped like a lot of of the sports bars.  The servers are all friendly and helpful, plus the happy hour has some great deals!!"}
{"text":"My first time here. We had the grilled chicken sandwich and the cheeseburger.  They were both juicy and tender. The waitress was very pleasant. Lots of TVs. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just bought a home over here and wanted to explore the area. Really happy we went here. Our waitress was extremely good. Super helpful and outgoing. We ordered the fried pickles. I must say they are the most uniquely cut fried pickle we have ever had. They were by far the most delicious. I highly recommend. I ordered the tortilla soup and cesaer salad. The salad was bland, but the soup was delicious. My husband ordered the fish tacos and thought they were great. Overall, good service, clean, quality food and reasonable prices. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go watch football. Their food is great bar food, the only complaint I have is it's always cold in there. So bring a jacket and you will be happy. Their rib basket in the appetizer menu with their homemade onion rings are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. Nice sports bar with lots of TV's. Tables that are \"meal\" or \"restaurant\" friendly so it's great even if you aren't a sports fan. Service was good from the hostess to the waitresses. Menu had lots of choices - almost too many.  The big score was the food! I was pleasantly surprised!!! I ordered the blackens chicken Alfredo and it was awesome!!! It came with thin cheese toast that was amazing. I had a late breakfast so I was full half way through but just couldn't stop eating it. The waitress went to get me a to go box and by the time she returned I finished it. My friend ordered the pastrami slides and fries - both were great! Sliders where choc full o meat and cheese and the fries where slightly larger than regular fries but not steal fries. They were cooked to perfection.  Like I said I was pleasantly surprised. If they can kill it on every dish in their menu I'd have to say \"hats off\" to the cooks/chefs!"}
{"text":"Very pricey when not on happy hour. Nothing special about this place. Service could be improved."}
{"text":"Josh (Manager) and Melody (bartender) are great. Excellent TVs."}
{"text":"Love blue 32! Especially the Chandler heights and higley location. My favorite patio to hang out on. My favorite is the nachos. They are like crack. I love going here on a date, with the girls or with my family."}
{"text":"I've been to Blue 32 three times now (twice at this location) and I've been impressed every time. Blue 32 is not your typical sports bar. It's clean, open, and really nice. They also have a large food menu and everything is made fresh. The service is also great and really accommodating.   Their Philly Cheesesteak was delicious. I got mine with cheese whiz. Only thing is I wish that it didn't have chopped up peppers in it. I thought they would be whole peppers that I could just take out. Noted for next time. The sweet potato fries were also really good. Thee steak in their Steak Cesar is also amazing. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. It comes with a really large piece of garlic bread. I wish that there was shredded parm on it though.  Definitely check this place out if you're looking for good \"bar food\" or if you want to catch a game."}
{"text":"Went last night with friends. Told the waiter we were gong to a movie in an hour and a half. The service was very slow. Food Ok not great. Had to flag down another server to get our waiter.  Made it to the movie just as the lights were dimming. They need to speed up their service and have more attentive servers."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place, visited some friends over there last Saturday. They had a great selection of local brews and there wings were good too."}
{"text":"Today we moved in across from blue 32. We were Very excited about living next to a sports bar. We had lunch there today and the food was good but our server couldn't remember what beers we ordered and what sizes. So we get the wrong sizes with the right beers. She continues to take our order 3 lunch specials and fried jalape√±os to start. 15 minutes later out come our tacos but we never got our app. It was not on our bill so I never said anything. We paid tipped over 20% bc we all have off days and left.  Figured we would go back for happy hour since they had some good deals. This bartender was very nice but when we asked what was on happy hour and she told us we all ordered happy hour drinks. She said wells were on happy hour so my friend ordered a well gin on the rocks.  I glanced at our tab and we had been charged $6.75 for a $4.75 well drink. We work in the industry and sometimes a \"rocks\" is charged more bc of the pour. So next round we ordered it neat. Same pour if not more at only $4.75. So we were being charged $2 for ice! The manager came over to talk to us about it and she said it's just the way the computers ring it up. She also said that neat and rocks was the same thing so why are we being charged $2 extra to put ice in the glass  Bottom line. If you are going to be charged more when you ask about happy hour. Please train your staff to let people know there is an up charge.  Once again. We work in the industry. We know how it works.  Good luck if you go here. We are just very glad there are so many other options across the street for us."}
{"text":"I came here the other night looking for beer and bar food, and was pleasantly surprised. Everything was delicious from our entrees of Monte Cristo and Steak tacos right down to how the loaded fries were seasoned. Even all the sauces they give you with the tacos are awesome! It seemed like they payed attention to detail in EVERYTHING they cooked. I plan on going back to catch a game or two!"}
{"text":"Update: recently stopped in for happy hour looking for a good summery, local craft brew. Sadly, there were not many local craft brews to choose from. Probably won't go back.  Initial Review: Great selection of craft beer and the burger was very good. Lots of TVs and plenty of space for large groups. Manager came to your table before we left and spent at least 10 minutes with us asking what we had, how we liked it and how everything in the restaurant is fresh made...except the french fries. A convenient stop on the way into or out of the Cine Capri movie theater. I will definitely be going back to try some more of their menu. The manager visit was key for me."}
{"text":"One of my go-to spots for great food, cold drinks, awesome staff/service, and plenty of sports  good for the whole fam   Most recently I tried the Pastrami sliders, and they're no joke  sliced thin, with Swiss cheese and Dijon (I got it on the side). I also added a side of Au jus (think French dip) and that totally turned this into some next level business    Bonus: their s were on point too, and seasoned just right   The  selection is awesome - traditional import/domestic options, with several local craft offerings, ranging from seasonal specialties to AZ staples."}
{"text":"Great service. The soup and salad lunch size was delicious and my mom really enjoyed the chicken Alfredo. Get the raspberry tea! Yum! We will be back"}
{"text":"Great food and fresh. They use fresh food that is not frozen and grind their own hamburger. Wings are great. Tacos al carbon and grilled chicken & avocado club are my favorite. The beans have great flavor too. The service is usually very good."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick work lunch. I love the atmosphere, feels like a true sports bar. I got the  spicy texas burger and it was great, cooked well, full of flavor, and a perfect size. The staff was extremely attentive and friendly. The only reason it's not five stars for me is because a 5 star place has to blow me away. everything was great here, definitely better quality than most sports bars, bu nothing that blew me away; AND THAT'S OK! Give this place a try, I find it hard to believe that anyone can eat here and not enjoy it. Thanks guy."}
{"text":"I love their fish and chips and they have good cocktails. They are pretty busy on the weekends so I would recommend calling ahead and putting your name on the list. Katie is a really nice waitress!"}
{"text":"MMMMMMMMMMMMMM the onion rings are the best I've had. The chicken club was also tasty. The only problem was my brothers coke was empty for a long time before she finally refilled it and that was when it was time for us to go. I don't quite understand why they charge for ranch dressing either, should come with the rings!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Not a typical sports bar, although on a big game night it can get that way. Please try the boneless wings & the best SW Salad ever!!"}
{"text":"Great Place.  After getting no service at Uncle Bears the kids and I headed over to Blue 32 to watch the game.  Had a great time, great food."}
{"text":"Good food. Great staff. They have created a place for the neighborhood that we want to keep coming back to!!"}
{"text":"Came here pretty late just to hang out and grab a few drinks and we really enjoyed our time. The place was clean and the service was pretty quick to get to our table. We ordered a few beers, which were average pricing and an appetizer. We got the spinach artichoke dip and it was phenomenal. The dip was delicious and the bread was like pressed cheesy bread... it was amazing.   Will definitely be back, maybe to try a happy hour deal."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time tonight and have to say we weren't disappointed. We were there with both of our Kids and the atmosphere was great for them as well. Hostess was really friendly as was our waiter. Food was very good especially the wings and ribs.. Only thing keeping from 5 star was the beer selection. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Blue 32 is quickly becoming one of the \"go-to\" bars in Gilbert. The beer selection features local brews as well as the usual national brands (+ the ubiquitous Bud Light) and the menu goes way beyond the usual bar food. The wait-staff is well trained, friendly and helpful - but never give one the feeling as if they are trying to turn the table as fast as possible."}
{"text":"I love Blue 32!  It is a great place to watch any game!  The Nachos are to DIE for!  I have also had some type of buffalo wing pizza.  I have only been there after 10pm when so i do not know how there full menu is but for a late night snack and some beers.  Plus they have Guinness on tap!! ENOUGH SAID!!  ;)"}
{"text":"Never, ever disappointed with food or service at Blue 32! Best sports bar in the area."}
{"text":"Perfect place for Sunday football! They have tons of tvs playing every game. Heaven for fellow fantasy football participants. The staff was on point and the food was really good. I def recommend the chicken and waffles from their breakfast menu. The chicken tenders were cooked to perfection and the waffles were so fluffy!! All for like $9 or something. They have a pretty good Bloody Mary for $4 on their early bird drink menu as well. My friends and I had a great time here! If I lived in az, I'd def make this place a regular spot for football sundays."}
{"text":"We had take out Tues night and the food was perfect, we then went back on Wednesday and dined in. The staff was great, the food was perfect again. Very happy. Keep it up. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"We've been to Gilbert location and had amazing burgers; Huge with so much favor! This one, on the other hand, was quite the opposite. Food over cooked, small portions and nothing special at all. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Maybe other food better, but their burgers were their signature so I'm not optimistic. We won't be going back:(."}
{"text":"Love the food here. It's much better than your average sports bar food. We love the food, atmosphere and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is excellent! Ahi salad is great! Steak Caesar salad is fantastic. Decent wines too!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere if your in the Gilbert area and need some bar food check it out"}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for a table.  They came over and asked if they can get us a drink while we waited and ordered a coke and then brought us a $4.00 bill.  Food was good once we got seated."}
{"text":"It is so unfortunate that others have ruined it for your regulars & yelp enthusiasts... Went to dine here \"tonight\" on our 20th Wedding Anniversary. We have been in numerous times before writing rave reviews & were so looking forward to using our FREE appetizer / dessert coupon we had received from your location one week ago via email. This promotion was valid from today ( our actual Anniversary) & expired on the 22nd of this month! After we placed our order for our appetizer: which was the Calamari, we were told ( when presenting our discount) we couldn't use the emailed version they sent us because it wasn't \"printed out\" as per the fine print. Our server then said: We've had so many other's abuse the system that they wouldn't be able to honor this emailed promotion- unless it's a \"printed copy\" ALONG with the email...Be prepared you must have BOTH!! I'm so sorry that I didn't pay more attention to their details or had the time & resources to pay additional $ to have it printed out. \"Who does this anymore?,This is so old school,\" ..Super confusing, unless you know otherwise! So be prepared people!! BTW- Keep in mind that there is NO scan bar to this, which would have made it that much easier & updated to today's technology! Seems to be- that this is more an issue with them accepting it ? Like \"excuse(s)\".. No option to speak with a manager?. \"Who knows\" if there was even one on staff? We then just told our server to please bring us our check. We paid for our drinks (2) which was over $14. Completely upset as I expressed this to their hostess on our way out the door.   It wasn't even that busy on a Wednesday night at 7:15 PM and they are worried about a coupon for a FREE appetizer & or dessert? Valued at $9 tops!! We would have spent additional time /& money on meals to cover their cost of this promotional offer they sent to me.. After writing 2 previous positive reviews- Experiencing this & not honoring a membership special they can't keep track of & that I took the time to sign up for : very disappointing!!  Won't be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"This is my third time to this location of blue 32. And so far I have absolutely no complaints. Orders were taken & food arrived promptly each time. I have to say I love the Buffalo Chicken wings & the steamed broccoli! The best part is they have happy hour Monday to Friday from 3 to 7 with prices on food & drinks raging from $3.25 to $6.50!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to get a drink or an appetizer with friends.  However, they don't have much of a craft brew selection.  If you are in the area and want more of a craft beer selection, I would go next door to Harvey American Public House.  I really like the shrimp and bacon quesadilla here and the customer service is usually really great.  I look forward to trying more food items on the menu in the near future."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night before heading to Harkins for a movie. The place was pretty empty, but the outside patio tables had a good crowd. We sat outside and why not it's finally nice and cool outside.   I ordered the BBQ burger. It was huge and juicy. I just remember it having grilled mushrooms, tomatoes, cheese, and a sweet BBQ sauce. I tried to get my mouth around this burger and had a hard time. That in it's self is amazing cause I have such a big mouth. Hahaha. Nice and thick. I have to say it was a tasty burger. I got sweet potato fries with it. The fries were nice and crispy. Not limp at all. Not too greasy but crispy just how I like it. Just eating that burger and fries really filled me up. Big portion.   As for our server, she was really nice and very friendly. Since she wasn't really that busy, she talked with us for awhile and joking around. Did I say friendly. Yep. Anyways, she filled my water cups and got my friends their drinks. Very attentive to us but then again not a huge crowd on a Tuesday night.   I had a really relaxing and enjoyable meal at Blue32. Good food. Huge portion. Good service. What else could you ask for at a sports bar. Oh yea lots of TVs too. So if you want to catch a bite before a movie then check this place out. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while because I've heard good things about the food- and it didn't disappoint!  Had a buffalo chicken salad and it was great!! I will definitely come back and order that salad again.   Ordered a side of french fries and they are awesome!   Hubby had the Kobe Beef dog and scarfed it down- said he loved it! Definitely add cheese!  We will be back- close to home, good atmosphere, service was great and the food was worth driving for. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Good vibe, good beer selection, happy people!!  TVs galore AND they have Dish Network so you'll never miss a PAC 12 Network game!  Thank God South Gilbert finally has a sports bar.   Big menu too!"}
{"text":"Meh. Nice tvs. Wait staff is like day shift at some dank hole-in-the-wall strip club (in that they seem like they hate their lives). Also, the food is ok but overpriced."}
{"text":"We just showed up one Wednesday night and were impressed by this place. It was Wing Wednesday which was a pleasant surprise. Entrees were about $10 each, lots of HDTVs for the games, and a news ticker scrolling scores. The food was all good and worth returning for. I was glad that they weren't as obnoxiously loud as the place next door with the live music cranked up to 11.  The restaurant was clean and they had very nice bathrooms with floor to ceiling stalls with individual lights. I might be back for March Madness!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I had a Steak Cesar salad. Just way too long of a wait for something that didn't blow me away, and a bit too crowded for my taste."}
{"text":"I would definitely come back here to watch a sporting event and have a few drinks, but it is off my list of places to eat actual 'meals'.  We were looking for something casual near the mall since the restaurants there are expensive and mediocre. Blue32 has a decent priced menu with lots of options, but it's obvious they excel with the bar food options. My group tried three different salads and they were all just blah. They sounded great on the menu but just didn't taste as fresh and delicious as we hoped."}
{"text":"Great American cuisine, good variety of choices. Love all the TVs - perfect sports environment!! Great for watching games. Ordered take out several times and they have not gotten order correct a few times but for the most part very good service. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"If I was only writing a review for food it would be 5 star!! The food was absolutely delicious!! My son had the mini cheeseburger kids meal w/ fries.  Burgers and fries were cooked perfectly!! I ordered the blackened shrimp tacos with coconut lime rice and omg it was to die for!! Probably the best I have had.  However, I have a 3 star review for the service. I got there to pick up my to go order and the hostess looked at me and said you need to go to the bar to pick up orders and looked back down at her booth.  I told her it was my first time there if she could at least point me in the right direction.  She seemed annoyed and told me back right.  I head back to the bar with my two kids in tow.  There is nowhere to stand and nobody to help you.  I finally waved down one of the employees to help me and they, just like the hostess, were annoyed.  They handed me my food and said when the bar tender rings you up she will call your name.  She cattle called my name and left the receipt for me to sign on the counter.  I had nowhere to sign seeing the whole bar was full so I had to apologize to one of the customers as I had to sign my receipt right on top of him.  Hopefully management reads this and comes up with a much better plan for people to pick up to go orders.  There has to be a better system!!  I will not make a to go order here again but hope to try dine in."}
{"text":"Not so good. Typical place to bring the team, burgers were dry, starters were cold. 1st round took 3trips over a 12 minute period.  Not busy tonight, but really slow.  We'll come back, cause it's our place after our planning meeting; but NOT consistent from visit.  Looking around our table, a lot of food left behind.  Not just me, I got the vote of seven others."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Checked back several times to make sure everything was good. Had 2 different meals. The rib appetizer was a value. Great sauce and fall off bone good. The burger was good but not the best. Will return"}
{"text":"Upscale sports bar without being too over the top.  Been there many a times for sporting events with a consistent good crowd that is never too over the top and never too withdrawn.  Food is great as is the service."}
{"text":"Fun Place to sit around a fire and enjoy some nachos - good value and lots of chicken on them.  TV screens all around for the Sports Fan.  I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Versatile menu - mediocre food & table service was tiring.  We had to ask for everything, nothing offered and extra charge for ranch dressing with the wings because they serve them with ranch.  Relaxed atmosphere with a lot of nice TVs. Good place for watching games & having a beer at the bar but not recommened if you are going for dinner.  Our birthday party of 16 was split into 2 tables which was very awkward, especially when you can see that if they moved a couple tables around they could have accomodated us to sit together.  Our dirty plates were left on the table even though our server had come and gone several times.  I ended up stacking them and handing them to her so we had room for dessert - birthday brownie (delicious) came with 4 spoons - we had to request more when she finally came back.  By the time we got the spoons the ice cream was melted.  Maybe because gratuity is included on large parties she just didn't care to give good service?"}
{"text":"There steak tacos are pretty good , it's what I get almost every time I go there ,  The reason why I gave it a 4 star is because the waits is a little long due to the food and the parking kind of sucks because it's always filled."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count. I've ordered a bunch of different things and never had a bad meal or service! The queso is delicious!   I recommend the Carne Asade! So delicious with the perfect amount of spuce.  The service is fast! There isn't a square foot without a TV."}
{"text":"On a weekday we came as a family after a school concert event. Our initial choice in the same plaza was not prepared so we went with Blue 32 as sure lock to accommodate all the different food request.   It wasn't a major game night (ie football, playoffs, etc...) so it was bit low key. Staff was friendly and easy. The only issue we had was that a few were at the bar area loud and vulgar. Not purposely intent but a fellas night out. So when we got seated near them I immediately asked to move and it was no issue. Honestly, it wasn't a big deal as I know how a guys night can be and the group noticed we moved due to it and dialed it down.   For dinner we were across the board with Grilled Cheese sandwiches, sliders, Moscow Mules, Burgers, Ribs and wings. I specifically has the Ribs and wings combo. Wings were tossed in a sauce (I told them to surprise me) and were good. Nothing over the top good as a takeaway but we weren't disappointed given the late time for dinner.   I wasn't a big fan of the large booths as they made for limited leg room and awkward views of the TV's I was interested in watching (NBA games at the times). Atmosphere overall was cool and would consider as an option when back in the area if with a group of people"}
{"text":"Blue 32 offers a clean sports bar atmosphere with average, typical bar food.  Their happy hour is limited and does not offer a lot in the way of drink or food items.  The staff is friendly and attentive to your needs.  It gets extremely crowded on Fridays so go early or go late if you don't want to wait for a ridiculous amount of time."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there. Nice layout inside. Parking is horrible. Food was ok. But don't charge me 8.75 for a glass of pinot grigio and think I'll be back. That's ridiculous for the kind of restaurant you are."}
{"text":"Delicious food (keto friendly), excellent service (shout out to Addie) and GREAT atmosphere. The Blue 32 burger is awesome (will substitute for veggie or turkey) but there are excellent entrees as well as tasty salads! Outdoor seating is available, and in a fairly quiet neighborhood."}
{"text":"Too many homeless people come here.  I've been waiting for 30 minutes for a table.  This place is packed full of homeless people watching football, and not one to f them is eating.  I'm looking at 3 booths that have only one person in each.  Out of those three booths, only one person has food.  The other two people have a single beer each, and they are not drinking them.  I counted 20 tables and booths and only 5 of them have food.  I don't know how this place is still in business.  This place only gets one star because of the pure stupidity of the owner not cycling people through his/her restraint.  This is definitely the last time I ever come here.  I suggest that if your hungry, go to a restaurant that does not allow a single person to occupy an entire table and only order water!"}
{"text":"Out in AZ for Labor Day and came here for lunch and drinks had the pleasure of meeting Lisa, Connie and Tanya and they were all super nice and the service was great. Food is really good and came out quick, interior is big and open and definitely a laid back environment. Perfect sports bar."}
{"text":"First time here.  This is a Sports Bar with freshest food.  It is made to order!  Had Buffalo Shrimp, Queso, BBQ ribs!   So good!  Bartender James was great!!! He was smiling, funny, and very attentive!  Loved this place and we will go back very soon!"}
{"text":"This Sports Bar has the best freshest food ever!!! They really make it to order!  Coldest big beers!!! They accommodated us by changing channel to College World Series!  Had all 4 TVs on great sports including US Open!  James best bartender smiled, nice, funny and took care of us! Great place we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Just visited today.. Your waiter Regal was amazing! Food was good, fast service and overall enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Food is always good, made from scratch, never frozen. Usually have to wait for seating, but even though it's March Madness, only waiting a few minutes. Tons of TVs so you can't miss the game (even if you wanted to.) Family friendly with high chairs available (but some tables are too high...saw a baby in a high chair that was stacked in another...NOT SAFE.) Friendly service, got drinks right away and server took order for appetizer. They have the best artichoke dip with parmesan toast. Ordered salad with goat cheese, nuts, and strawberries and Monte Cristo with onion rings split to be shared by two people. One snafoo: they forgot to send out the dip. Once the meals arrived they offered to get it for us but too late. They were very apologetic and offered a free dessert, but their meals are very large so we didn't want dessert. Food was DELICIOUS and split very nicely. The restaurant was filled and had a lively atmosphere. We really enjoyed our meal. When we paid, our server gave us a certificate for a free appetizer for next time, and we will be back. Only drawback is the parking lot. Always packed and very tight spaces with narrow lane. Not good in a town with large family SUV's and ranchers' pickups. I'm not kidding when I say parking is tight. It's terrible. drove my husband's brand new car and was truly worried about finding it damaged or damaging it myself trying to get out of the parking space. (No problem...knock on wood.)"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO BLUE 32 on Sundays during football season. I typically like blue 32 and their food but they do not do a waiting list for people on Sundays. That makes no sense. You are also not able to call ahead and be put on a wait list to be seated. I usually like to go there after church on Sunday but when they can't even get me on a wait list when i call ahead, well then I don't have time or patience for Blue 32 then and will take my business elsewhere. Also i was told by a hostess that the entire restaurant was open seating on a  Sunday when the restaurant was full. So I'm just supposed to stand around and watch everyone until a table becomes available? Yeah right. Get it together Blue 32 and have a wait list and a call ahead list otherwise you will continue to lose business."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night.  Service was good and so was food.  I sat in a odd shaped booth.  Lots of tv's.  Place had a good vibe.  I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"I really like Blue 32 Sports Grill, I really do, but today was an epic fail on the part of the restaurant and their customers.  WTH thinks it's okay to bring five young boys to a Sports Bar on a Saturday, plant them in a booth by themselves while the parents sit at a completely different table and drink the afternoon away watching college football?  What do you think the boys do? They run around the restaurant screaming and yelling while the parents drink and watch TV without any regard to what their kids are doing. Maybe I'm really old school, but my parents would never have taken me to a Sports Bar and would never have tolerated this type of behavior.  So, why you say is he giving Blue 32 a two star rating, it isn't their fault? Nope it's not, but they sat us right next to this booth and then ignored us for 10 minutes. Not a we'll be right with you, no drinks, no water no one ever bothered to stop by the table. Finally we left. And I was REALLY looking forward to their Onion Rings because they are SO good!"}
{"text":"In the year since Blue 32 opened in Gilbert, I've been there a handful of times. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly and pleasant. They've got a good menu and a decent selection of beers on tap. As a sports bar, you can't ask for much more. TVs are everywhere and the staff is willing to tune a TV to the sporting event of your choice if it isn't already on. It's no surprise that this place is usually packed for big sporting events."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever rated a sports bar so well but Blue 32 was everything we needed to watch the opening rounds of march madness!  We were greeted with a full map of TVs that outlined which games were being played on which TV. This is much appreciate as someone who went specifically to watch games. We picked our seats accordingly. The service was helpful, friendly, and prompt, pointing out the NCAA tournament specials and helping us with food options. The food was typical prices for a sports bar and probably on the lower end for Scottsdale. The BBQ chicken salad and carne tacos were both great!  Also, there's free wifi!   Overall: impressed and will return!"}
{"text":"Usually come here on Saturday days and the bartender is Dalice. I sit and watch her work.  She greets customers even when she's busy,  tells them she will be right with them.  That in my opinion is great customer service.  She's efficient and friendly.  That makes a great bar.  Obviously the food was good and drinks even better.  Great service,  keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Went to happy hour last night, our waiter was attentive and very happy. I never had to ask for a refill and enjoyed the delicious wings, fries, and nachos."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Everything is fresh and you can really tell. I've never had a bad plate or app. Good beer selection and plenty of large tv's. Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fabulous service today. Bruschetta uniquely presented, and quite flvorful. We couldn't go to a sports bar without Buffalo wings; but saw the Buffalo shrimp and of course ordered it. They were fried perfectly not tough. Loved the medium sauce; wasn't overbearing spicy.  Tried the edamame. The side sauce added a nice pleasant flavor. Bonus, they saved out leftovers while went to the movie next door. Good job replacing the previous place guys!"}
{"text":"Went back on this recent trip to Phoenix - food still stellar.  But, the service was again \"meh\" and they weren't busy.  I thought it might be have been the group next to us, but, no - the service is just so-so.  Probably the only reason it stands out is because I think the food, decor, etc, all earn 5 stars and the service is just not there."}
{"text":"For a long time my kids tried to talk me into eating here, but I stuck up my nose because it was a sports bar, and how good could that be really?  I caved in one day and was I surprised.  That was several years ago and now we go there at least once a week.  We have tried almost everything on the menu and it is always superb.  If you are into watching sports while you eat you will not be disappointed and if your not, well they keep the volume turned down so you do not even notice its on."}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere, and the staff was surprisingly cordial and welcoming.  One of the wait staff came over, while we were waiting for our table, and asked us if we wanted something from the bar.  We were seated shortly after having our drinks hand delivered.  We both ordered the ribeye entree, after hearing great reviews from a coworker.  The accompanying smashed potatoes were crispy on the outside, soft & tender on the inside. Perfectly salted and parmesaned (can you use cheese as an adjective?).  Big stalks of broccoli, buttered, but undercooked, almost raw.  Black & blue coleslaw was very good. If you like blue cheese then you'll love this. Looking forward to trying it on a pulled pork sandwich.  Their ribeye was bursting with flavor. Tender & juicy. NOT what you'd expect from a neighborhood sports grill. The flavor rivaled Houston's. I can't say enough good things about it. We ordered it medium-rare, more on the rare side.  The manager came to check on us twice.  Once when we had to return my wife's steak, as it was overcooked.  He was very accommodating and had the replacement out in record time.  With steak, sometimes this happens, but it is how you remedy the situation that makes for a great experience.  I highly recommend Blue 32."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Typical pub food. The food is not the problem here. It's the noise. This place is so loud you can't even carry on a conversation. Our waiter was great! I wish I knew he's name but I couldn't hear him when he told us."}
{"text":"Honestly, Amazing and great quality food! I have been here twice and will continue to go back. Excellent customer service and great for big groups.   I recommend loaded fries, Calamari, Mushroom Burger. Their Burgers are great overall. You can't go wrong.   The food price is on the higher end ($10-13); however the atmosphere and quality of food make it worth it."}
{"text":"Had perviously given them an awful review, but have since been back. It has been amazing ever since my awful experience. Would recommend the country fried chicken 10/10."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, we have been there four times now and always treated great by everyone.   Food is delicious and reasonably priced.   We will continue return as will our friends."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and attentive, restaurant is nice but a bit plain. Got a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and two beers and it was about $32 (with a 15%tip) for one person.  Im so glad they charge an extra ¬¢30 for that side of ranch so they can stay in business after charging $13.29 for a chicken sandwich and fries (rolls eyes). The sandwich was well cooked but fell apart making it a mess to eat, I would prefer the avacado be guac so it could hold it together better. As it was the top bun just slid the hell off making me have to literally put my sandwich  back together for my second bite. Additionally, the bacon stuck out a solid 3 inches off of each side of the sandwich (that's just lazy) resulting in my bacon chicken sandwich being bacon free for half the bites.  Beer selection was decent. Standard bud, Miller, cooers, hef, stella, and gunness, with only three local brews on tap (hop knot IPA, kiltlifter, and a papago IPA). But they do have fresh squeeze IPA Deschutes on tap so they get a pass.  So overall this place is decidedly average. Beer is overpriced, food is underwhelming for it's price, service was excellent. I find it hard to recommend this place as there is literally nothing memorable about it. Just another overpriced sports bar."}
{"text":"Was meeting a few friends and wanted to sit down and grab a bite. One of my buddies recommended this place and it was all of our first times there. Everything we all had was great, especially the monte cristo. Id come back."}
{"text":"I had the best spinach artichoke I have ever had in my life at Blue 32. The bread they give to dip it in was amazing. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap which I really liked. It had great flavor! Our server was really good, too. I would love to try the other  menu options here, however, we are here on vacation so it may be awhile."}
{"text":"Blue 32 is located right off Higley - the Hostess was friendly and informed us the bar area was open seating.   This visit was purely for a Adult Beverage before a family function, our server was hilarious when we told him reason for our visit. The beer was cold and refreshing and just what was needed prior to event. The server was swift knowing we were limited with time.    Will got back for Menu items"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!  I'm thinking BANQUET microwave meals.  Nice service though!  Good atmosphere.  I just don't know what Arizonians are thinking other than the beer is cold!"}
{"text":"time for an update, I come here to do some chillaxin. relaxed atmosphere and plenty of TV's to watch your fave game. I am still lovin the tacos al carbon, which is carne asada tacos, served with rice, small side of queso, salsa. Excellent quality and oh so yummy, and I am sure it's a top secret ingredient. I give props to Lindsay, the best server west of the mississippi. I enjoy this place so much that I had to bump up one star, for the ambiance, staff, and tacos. I hope they keep it up."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great staff. The wait can get long but that's expected. Super fun environment to be in on game nights. Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Both times between 1 & 3pm. Food is very good. Staff is very personable. However the service was extremely slow. We waited and waited for our food. Last Friday I had to hunt down someone to get our check. That's not good. I really like the restaurant. So I will try again and hopefully the service will get better."}
{"text":"Solid food and great service every time. Lots of TVS for the games, nice atmosphere(we bring the kids). I love the wings and the marbled patty melt, wife orders the chicken fried chicken every time and lives it. Cory was our waiter tonight and went out of his way big time. Excellent server. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is great for going to watch a game. The bar food is tasty and the atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was ok. One suggestion would be to have one lo cal or fat free salad dressing choice."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night to get some take out we ordered.  It was packed!  Food was good.  I wish they had packaged the sweet potato fries by themselves.  They put them under the chicken sandwich, and by the time they got them home, the fried we soggy.  My mom and I split the avocado chicken sandwich, and it was delicious.  I am not a fan of big crowds, so if you want to eat there on a weekend, I recommend picking up and requesting the fries in a separate container!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, great menu and beer selection. So excited to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is your average sports bar. I haven't found anything too special about Blue 32. I've been to their location at Scottsdale and the 101 and the one off of Scottsdale Road further south. They have nice TV's and play the big games over the sound system. They have a good selection of sandwiches, burgers, salads, etc.   Last time I was there I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and it was really yummy. Not a traditional cheesesteak but their own take on it and it was very good, I would order it again. I've also had their wraps and they are huge! They have big sized portions so you definitely get your fill!  I'll continue to visit Blue 32 to watch big sporting events but you won't see me go out of my way to eat there. The staff has been pretty friendly every time."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The food is mediocre and WAY OVER PRICED for the quality. This place is fine for some beers in the bar and watching sports but eat before you get here."}
{"text":"Our favorite place, the only complaint it's always packed. When it's goid I guess that's what happens"}
{"text":"Beers and burgers, yes sir! There is actually something delicious on the menu that I had never tried before and didnt sound good, but it changed my life. Philly cheesesteak salad! This is a real mans salad and I loved every bite! Meaty cheesy delicious! I told the server a better name for it would be Meat Lettuce. She LOL'd but its still the Philly on the menu. ; )"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an evening catching up with a friend.  We sat at the bar.  The bartender was attentive, but allowed us to sip and gab.  Noticed that most of the tables with food had the calamari.  Decided it was a good indication they would be good, and since our first visit I went for those.  Happy to say I was not disappointed.  My friend wanted to get something a little healthier, and asked about salad selections.  The bartender steered her towards the salmon salad.  I am not a fan of salmon, but I can say she said it was delicious."}
{"text":"Best coleslaw I've ever had, it has blue cheese and bacon in it.  I order the fried shrimp and fries with cole slaw...it's not on the menu but they are very accommodating and allow me to order it...it should be on the menu though because it's some of the best fried shrimp in town!  My Husband and I have been here a handful of times and tried quite a few items on their large menu and have NEVER been disappointed.  Consistently great food, quality ingredients, and superior service.  Fun sports bar atmosphere serving \"evolved\" bar food..."}
{"text":"K and I stopped in for happy hour while C was at one of his rehearsals. This place is a very big sports bar. Depending on the time and day, this place can be super crowded. So be forewarned. If you hate waiting for a table, call ahead and ask if there's a wait. On our first visit we didn't have to wait for a table in the bar, however, there was a wait for a table in the dining room. Because of the large amount of people waiting for a table we concluded that either the service and food were outstanding OR that the lovely people of Gilbert didn't know how to use Yelp to find anywhere else to go. On 2 subsequent visits the wait was too long and we opted to go elsewhere.  Luckily, it was the first reason. Our server was Michael. He was great. He told us about the menu, was polite and took good care of us.  We were going to order the Nachos until I saw that they are made with Queso. OMG, aside from a sports arena or movie theater, why would any respectable restaurant use Queso to make Nachos? I have to admit that when I read that I wasn't expecting the food we did order to be any good. I'm glad I was wrong.  K and I ordered the Calamari ($9.29). These were lightly breaded and fried morsels with some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. They were perfectly cooked which for a sports bar is amazing. They come with some remoulade sauce which I didn't use but K said it was fine.  We also ordered the Spinach Artichoke Dip ($9.79). Artichoke pieces and spinach mixed into a 4 cheese blend. This came out bubbly hot and the cheese blend they use was delicious. It's served with toasted parmesan bread which we ran out of but Michael brought us more.  Crowded. Fair Prices. Great Food. Good Service. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Good place to go for a drinks and food.  The menu is pretty extensive for basically a sports bar and the quality is very good.  My wife and I have tried various appetizers and meals and are very pleased.  It will be come one of our regular places."}
{"text":"This is a sports bar so the service is a little on the slow side if you happen to be in a hurry. Food is very good, fresh and properly cooked. Turkey Reuben is fabulous as well as the tacos and burgers. Love that Wednesday evening is kids eat free night - bring something to do during the waiting periods.  TV's everywhere so you never have to strain to check out your favorite game/match.  Servers are always friendly. Friendly crowds. Nice patio weather permitting."}
{"text":"Not great service (Slow) or food (pricey), but not as bad as some places in North Scottsdale.  The wings came out an odd yellowish color, but they tasted OK. The wife had the Nachos, which she enjoyed, but the Salsa they had was much better, I thought.  Plenty of TV's in the place (should be considering it used to be a Buffalo Wild Wings) but the server's seemed inexperienced and not really interested in going the little extra that sets mediocre service apart from above average...so to sum it up,  if you're not in a hurry (and we were to catch a movie) and like overpriced food, stop here. You definitely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Blue 32 is not your average sports bar.   The food here varies from good to excellent and the prices are reasonable. I've never had a bad meal here.   The one time I didn't enjoy my margarita they comped the drink and asked what could be done to improve it. The next time I came by they had improved the drink!"}
{"text":"Yummoooo wings and lots of draft beers to choose from!! Perfect place to visit before the movies!!! Onion rings, sweet potato fries & any beer you want to choose from on tap! Yummy people to look at too makes this a win win for everyone!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!  Everything I have ordered here has been delicious!!!  Customer service is off the charts!!!"}
{"text":"Great upgrade from that Buffalo Wild Wings (and the wings are better).  B32 will hopefully have a long run.  Clean, good food, good staff and great placement of flat screens.  The perfect non-dive sports bar!"}
{"text":"My wife, friends and I love this place. The food is terrific (anything on the menu) as the service and atmosphere. Some of the best burgers I've had in Chandler with reasonable prices. It's our gain that this company came to Chandler!"}
{"text":"Nice place, but the beer is EXPENSIVE!....even for just a Coors Light.  You can walk to other places nearby that are a fraction of their prices.  Prices on food look average, but I do like the menu.  Very nice inside though as it is new."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here at least twice a month. Every single time we come we are always impressed by the service! Staff and servers are always friendly and the food is always amazing! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times and go out of our way for the food and service.  It is my wife's favorite getaway spot due to the artichoke dip.  Last day of vacation choice for an early dinner (slow and no crowds at 3:30-4:30).  Sat down right away and ordered our usual meal of kids favorite choices (steak bites and Mac and cheese=yum) and crispy wings (ordered that way with extra ranch to split=.25c) and artichoke dip and a couple adult beverages. All good till the food came (no extra ranch and took 10mins to get it along with long periods between empty drinks=they were not busy).  Wings were not crispy and didn't notice that they were pink (noticed not crispy as ordered) till the last few--yuck.  Artichoke dip had HUGE pieces of artichoke due to poor prep work so wife wasn't happy. I showed the waitress the pink wing and she offered a $2.50 (employee discount)=undercooked chicken is dangerous.  Times in between drinks seemed endless and finally got the last Bacardi/diet delivered with lime (I hate lime and ordered all without).  Both kids meals had the kids raving and ate every bite (only reason I rated 2 stars).   Needless to say we didn't enjoy our family time out of the house this trip. We have been there a dozen times and this time was doomed from the time our food was delivered.   Management may want to check in on Sunday to make sure the service and quality are being managed as today they both were not.  Very disappointed with a pricy meal that didn't come close to minimum expectations (yes I still tipped)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beverage before our movie. A little pricey but that's about right for the area. They had a good TV set up at the bar, not sure about the rest of the place.  I'd come back and watch sports here if it wasn't too busy."}
{"text":"We've been to different locations before, and this one opened a few months ago I believe. They're close to my house and we decide to check out this new spot for dinner.   I wasn't too hungry so I ordered an appetizer. We got the nachos and this thing was huge!! There was three of us and we still only got through about half of it. I really liked the cheese they put on it. I always order their strawberry martini. It's pretty refreshing,   Their burgers are usually good too. Service was good and pretty quick."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend a few days ago for dinner and drinks. I found it on Yelp of course. =)  I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the chicken tenders and my friend ordered the fish and chips. The chicken tenders were ok. I wish they were a little bit crispier. For drinks I ordered the Fresh Strawberry martini. I loveddddd it. Not only was it well worth the $9 but it was made with fresh strawberries which I loved. My friend ordered the Appletini which was also quite tasty.   I would definitely come back for their drinks. They do have a happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-7 which I'd like to come back for the drinks again and to try their appetizers.The only thing that got me was we got charged for sides of ranch. I ordered chicken tenders so I felt that it should've already come with the meal not be charged extra. The service was really good. Our waitress was really friendly. It's a really good place to just hang out and watch a game for all you sports lovers. =)"}
{"text":"Well, the review starts out a little like this....  Came into Blue 32 for Taco Tuesday at 6:30pm. Happy hour ends at 630 and Taco Tuesday is supposed to start after happy hour...   Savvy, our very friendly and awesome server informed us that Taco Tuesday didn't start until after 7pm.. Savvy had the manager Lindsay come explain the issue to me as she wasn't sure why the time wasn't changed herself...     Lindsay came to the table and told us (family of 4) that she could not honor the Taco Tuesday price until 7pm. I asked why happy hour ends now at 630 and Taco Tuesday doesn't star until 7... She said it just hasn't been changed yet and that there would be a lot of changes made in the future.  She told me that she can not control the pricing on the tacos but could Chang the prices in the computer to give me happy hour prices on filler food if I wanted to wait in the Taco order placement until 7pm.    I find it dumb that a manager can override happy hour prices but not Taco Tuesday prices.....   Great server, crappy management / computer system!!!"}
{"text":"Even with it being pretty busy, the staff was so attentive. Food came out quickly and the beer was on point. My burger wasn't extraordinary but my fianc√©'s Philly cheesesteak salad was delicious. I will make a trip back!"}
{"text":"Two of our friends, my husband and I visited this establishment last night. When the server brought our drinks, another server tried to slip past her due to overcrowding at the table next to us, knocked into her and she spilled the drinks on my husband and one of our friends. She apologized but then acted put off when the guys asked for extra napkins to try to dry off.   The other server had to ask the manager to come over as our server did not think about it. It took a ridiculously long time to get anything we asked for. Although the manager did comp one appetizer for us, she made no sense. In her apology she stated, \"We rarely ever spill drinks on anyone.\" Then in the same breath she said, \"It does happen. I did it last night.\" Really? If it is rare why is it happening night after night?   To top that off, when my friend was trying to ask a question our server walked away mid sentence and started taking care of another table. This was extremely rude and showed a serious lack of paying attention. Our friends said they love going there and have never had such terrible service or anything like that happen.   Although I liked my food, my husband and I will not go back to this spot. This was our first time there and the first impression was rotten."}
{"text":"I read the reviews in advance. Maybe I needed to delve into the menu, but I just wasn't too impressed due to a couple factors . . .   PROS: plenty of TVs; friendly service; beer was fresh/cold; chips/queso were okay; clean facility  CONS: chicken wings must have been to Jenny Craig before they went to the wing factory . . . meat on the bone was sparse--paltry--disappointing . . . The bar volume was set to 11. Seriously, I found it hard hear my colleague above the din of our fellow diners. Annoying.  Fellow Yelpers are pretty big on this place--perhaps the menu has some gems worth trying. My experience, however, did not inspire me . . .   Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"We came here to watch the heartbreaking UA vs UNLV basketball game.  It is a typical sports bar that is a bit more family friendly -- lots of parents and babies.  Tons of TVs from multiple angles, so they can definitely put on whatever game you were hoping to watch.  I had some wings and a burger with fries.  I wouldn't say they were super memorable, but they were tasty when I ate them.  We arrived a little before the game started, and stayed until the end.  Our waiter was super awesome with the refills, and didn't push us to leave at all.  I would definitely come here again if I come back home and need to get my sports-watching on."}
{"text":"This is always a wonderful place. Staff always friendly and food always great. I love it"}
{"text":"Nice alternative for an afterwork dinner.  Exceptional service and reasonable prices.  Food and beverages offered are awesome, and if you enjoy something simple, the chocolate chip cookies for desert are a great surprise.  The sports bar atmosphere doesn't feel as canned as some others... great staff attitude goes chapters in making a nice experience."}
{"text":"The wings and other food here is good, but the service leaves little to be desired. I've been here a handful of times and always give them the benefit of the doubt hoping the service will be better next time. We sit at the bar every time in hopes of getting drinks quicker. I don't know how anyone catches a buzz here with how long your glass will sit empty before a bartender asked if you want another."}
{"text":"I had their special Blue32 Black and Blue burger which is supposed to be their signature, and a side Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was romain lettuce, with watered down dressing, dry Parmesan cheese and stale crusted cheese 'crouton' bread. Very average but edible. The burger was an absolute disaster. Dry and over cooked patty with little or no flavor. Bacon that was over cooked and probably re heated from their breakfast/brunch. Almost had a beef jerky texture. The bun was also flavorless. I had to drink a lot of water to choke it down. My wife had the Greek salad with diced chicken and said it was good. The food here is almost as bad as Zipps, don't bother - drive to Keegan's or Teakwoods. Worst burger I have eaten in years."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars but the manger kind of rubbed me the wrong way . We have come here three times in the past two weeks for happy hour ( street tacos ) they are delicious.. tonight the service just was \"meh\" . A buddy of ours had ordered a Greek salad - which we had ordered two days prior . ( it's supposed to be a pretty big salad $13- and was a lot of food) his food came out and before he started eating it he said is this the half size or side salad ? I mean , it was small! Our waitress was like oh no , let me go tell  the manager- we watched her talk to him .... we also watched him look at us and shake his head like \"oh well\" ... several times he walked by our table and we thought he would at least come speak with us , offer a little more lettuce , something.!!! He did nothing-/- couldn't even make eye contact with us . We weren't asking for anything free, not looking to get a discount, just wanted to show him that they had given him the side salad by mistake. I even tried to get his attention after we had paid the bill and he just acted like he was too busy to pay any attention to us. Not good customer service. I will probably return here for the food but I'm all about good customer service and I don't think it's that hard - as a manager , to just assess the situation & see what he can do to make the paying customer happy. Our poor buddy watched us finish our food ..: and we stopped at Wendy's to get him a real salad on our way home .  The other times we have been here ( Sunday's ) our service was amazing ! This time it was like super bad.... again, the food is good - the manger is just not good at doing his job !"}
{"text":"Very good salads and calamari. Service was a little slow one of the nights we visited but not horrible to stop going back."}
{"text":"Picked up take out from there tonight.. ordered the Philly cheesesteak .. I literally live down the street so I was home in about five minutes... the plastic containers they put the sandwich in had no ventilation so by the time I got home the condensation in the box had ruined everything inside.. the sandwich bread was just a complete mess.. the soggy onion rings were terrible .. complete waste of money... they need to get that problem figured out !"}
{"text":"Consistently good, tasty food. Love their Carne Asada & burgers. Plenty of TVs & games. Family friendly. Loud & fun. Ashley Quinn is always on point, excellent service!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day after a movie and again Sunday football. Food was great both times.   Service was good. Most of the server staff is outgoing and friendly. Some might have been having a bad day. Happens to everyone.  I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"Best boneless chicken wings ever!!! They have great service. Everything is awesome on the menu.  The fact that they have Golden Tee is the icing on the cake!!! Best sports bar in town!!!"}
{"text":"Great casual dining. I had their wings and a salad, both were great and I would come back for more.  Service was as expected.  Great place to go for a casual night out!"}
{"text":"Blue 32 in south Gilbert is a great addition to the neighborhood!  This is by far the best place in south gilbert. The food is great. We have tried something different every time we've been here. Everything has been really good. The service is spot on. Super nice wait staff. Not ever much of a wait. We have even ordered to go and everything has been right and tasted great. This is a great little tucked away neighborhood bar! We will be back again and again! Try the loaded cheese fries they are AM-AZ-ING!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar, excellent food & a/v pkg. heads n shoulders above area comp. highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food, great Happy Hour, good selection of drafts. Very friendly staff and great place tho catch a game."}
{"text":"I love Blue 32! They have the best service, awesome food, and Ashley is such a friendly bartender! I've been coming here for 6 years and they only get better."}
{"text":"My favorite sports bar! Food here is awesome, most items are made fresh in-house. Service is excellent every time. Their buffalo sauce is amazing and must be sampled, one of my favorite buffalo sauces! You can't go wrong with Blue32"}
{"text":"We went here last night and were impressed by the food. The ribs were delicious. They came with two generous portions of sides.  The buffalo chicken wrap was very good. Lots of sauce.  Nice selection of sides. Reading the other reviews I was not sure what to expect with the service but it was perfect. Friendly and checking back at the right times.  Ambiance is a basic sports bar."}
{"text":"First let me chuckle at the reviews that rate it low because it's busy or loud.  Folks....REALLY?  Seriously you rate this place low because you can't sit right down on a weekend night you have some issues. If an empty quiet place is what you are looking for Burger King and Harveys right next door to Blue may be the spot for you. ..  Okay first service is always top notch.   The servers are great, friendly, attentive and most importantly  knowledgeable on ALL of the menu items.   Is the food gourmet?  Nope it is a sports bar, but personally I have not found a place that compares the quality and taste of the food at this place.  I am not kidding, there is not one menu item that I have tried that I haven't enjoyed.  My personal favorites, boneless wings, grilled mahi tacos, buffalo chicken flat bread pizza and pasta alfredo.    This is by far my families and my favorite dinner spot and it seems by the crowds many agree with me."}
{"text":"Love this location.  It was a beautiful night so we sat outside.  We were in a large group- 10 total, and the patio was very comfortable for this large of a group.    Service was excellent as well- which I think can be tricky with this many people -so Kudo's to our server!  We all had drinks and appetizers and the food was served quickly.  I had the wings which were delicious and shared some chips and queso which was also good.    Fun night was had by all!  Service was quick and friendly...we will definitely go back and Blue 32 will be added to my favorite neighborhood places!"}
{"text":"Sports bar...they serve food.  Food is better than average.  What else can you say?"}
{"text":"Volume was unacceptably high; food was mediocre. There are many better choices around."}
{"text":"This last visit was really disappointing. I ordered the 'adult' grilled cheese with added jalapenos and a side of loaded fries. They left off the jalapenos and brought the wrong side, and I didn't get my loaded fries until we were pretty much finished eating. I expected something to be comped or discounted - nope.  And the service was apathetic. Oh, yeah, and the tomatoes on the grilled cheese made it soggy.  We started coming here less frequently because they don't have much for vegetarians and their beer selection is weak. But we used to enjoy the friendly staff and the atmosphere. This experience didn't help."}
{"text":"I wasn't too excited about eating bar types of food....but this restaurant has given me a different point of view. Overall, it was decent.   I ordered two appetizers for my main entree: bruschetta and buffalo wings. They gave generous portion of toasted bread as well as flavor tomatoes. Overall, it was decent. I specifically requested for my Buffalo wings \"all flat\" but it didn't come out that way (and I was too hungry to correct them). Nevertheless, I did enjoy their wings.   The service was also acceptable. Our waitress did come by to give us refill often. My only complain was her constant interruption when I was in the middle of the conversation with friends (multiple times). I don't expect her to stand and wait until I finished talking, but a simple \"excuse me\" would be nice instead of talking over me. I was pretty irritated after she did it the 3rd time.   In conclusion, this is a great place for a quick bite. Food and service is average....I might come back here again and hope it will give me a better experience in both food and services."}
