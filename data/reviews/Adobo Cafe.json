{"text":"Chef Charles makes excellent healthy food and it's all freshly made in house.  I'd recommend anyone in the area come in and try his daily specials.  His breakfast items are also all excellent, you can't go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"I visit this place at least three times a week. Charles is a true Chef, I love their food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am always so surprised when I check into the Yelp app and the business is no where to be found. Perhaps it's easy for a local biz  in Toronto to get recognition but where's the love for the family owned suburb shops? Then my light bulb goes off, and in that sparkling magical moment I enjoy my special little self the most.  - It's a tough job but someones gotta do it! 
Allow me to introduce this cute little lunch cafe placed discreetly on a hill in a heavily industrial type area. If you are driving on Tomken, after the bridge you will see a hill to the left. There stands a board welcoming 'Adobo Cafe' in chocolate brown thick font with a safari type of theme and a pale forest green background. I enjoy the atmosphere of this place because the staff make everyone feel really welcome. The restaurant itself is located in an odd place so expect to find a bit of difficulty finding the door. My advice is, once you turn onto Timberlea (there's only one way to go) take your first right into the business plaza and another right. This way should take you to the front of the building. Keep driving till you see a tiny patio on the left side (your right side would be the street, Tomken). There's plenty of parking space which I always consider a bonus. The door is wedged really awkwardly between a pillar and another door. You go in and your faced with another door with the weekly menu taped on the door (kind of like a - check yourself before you wreck yourself' ) I enjoy this.

Chef Charles makes new daily specials that have your taste buds on some type of vacation fiesta. I do believe he is owner but I cannot be too sure. You'll know him as soon as you walk in... or at least, he'll make sure he knows you. 

Upon my 3rd visit , Charles offered to edumecate me on what Adobo is. Turns out, it's not just a catchy cool biz name, but a dish of marinated vegetables and meat or fish; served with rice. In the Philippines, the further into the provinces you go , the more twists on the recipe. Example: some areas add ginger, others are prepared with more broth. Here at the caf√©, the adobo is made from chicken, pork, or beef, and braised in Soya sauce, cane sugar, vinegar, garlic, and bay leaves. - Salivating yet? 

 The creations every week are above average quality and it isn't your regular 5$ place. A regular entre will be close to $9.00 and worth it. The ingredients are fresh and you can see everything while they make it for you. My absolute favourite is the Crab brisk cream mixed with arugula on a whole wheat bagel and a salad - The crab mixture is a deliciously creamy combination of arugula, crab sticks, pickles, roasted red peppers, carrot shreds, cucumbers and dill all mixed in with mayo. The consistency of the cream is wonderfully complimentary to the dry bagel. This comes with a stuffed green olive held by a toot pick on top of the bagel and a Greek salad on the side. This dish is perfect for a summer lunch where it leaves you wholesome and seafoody but light enough that you can bounce happily back to work. The rest of the dishes are just as inventive and should be tried. You can afford to be adventurous here and I usually do. Since I don't eat pork , it's definitely hard to hear all the raves from the regulars talking about how great the pulled pork panini was - so I'm passing this onto all you pork lovers - come get some. 

The place itself is decent sized but small and it has a few tables and chairs inside as well as a tiny patio outside. The walls have random objects and pictures from all the travels the owners done, which I think is neat-O! The process is much like a school cafeteria- get a tray from then slide it to the cash, pay, seat yourself and eat. During , usually when the crowd rush dies down the chef comes around and asks how everything is. He really is very talented and friendly so it makes it easy to talk about recipes and tips with him. Rest assured, the rest of the staff are just as friendly. I took my boss to lunch here (it's how I roll) and she was impressed. Then shortly a few coworkers and they were really happy with it. If you do end up being in the neighbourhood , do try this place and high five the chef, he's good people. 

Signing off

{"text":"Considering this area doesn't have a ton of options, I was impressed to find this restaurant. It felt like the options had more of downtown slant but in the burbs. Good for lunch, with lots of healthy options."}
{"text":"The reviews are right! I've been waiting for ages to come here because I work Monday to Friday during their operating hours, but finally got to visit.

Coming up to the building and they are cooking delicious looking meats and veggies on the grill outside full steam! Love that they use food they cook and not bagged frozen meat!

We ordered their classic breakfast, veggie sandwich with brie and avocado and the western omelette. 

Every plate had pretty design of vegetables and fruit on it. The actual food was good, especially the veggie sandwich.

The service was excellent and homey. I would definitely come back again hopefully for lunch!

Their prices are great!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. Will revisit to try some of the other things on the menu.  I was recommended the soup by the owner and it was for sure worth the money.  The quality was great and the food was flavorful.  Being Filipino I am a little more bias but i think that anyone would enjoy the food served here.  Definitely a hidden gem in the Mississauga area! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really great service!! Highly recommend the sandwiches and salads. I was in a huge rush (heading out to the airport) and thy were able to get me in and out within 30 minutes, that's pretty good. A lot better than the options at the airport when it comes to food. Would certainly return next time I'm looking for a quick quality bite by the airport in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to have found this gem of a restaurant. It is my new go-to place for lunch.
The food is fantastic even if you factor out the lack of competition in the area.

I tend to get a lunch special because it's always something different. There are usually two of them - a lunch plate or a sandwich - for about $10 each. Soup or salad is included as well. The meals are absolutely delicious. Flavourful and very unique. Chef Charles, who has quite the personality, uses all sorts of ingredients that would be at home in a trendy, upscale, downtown restaurant. But he makes them work in a simpler, down-to-earth way. While $10 won't get you stuffed, you will enjoy every bite you take (and you can always get something else on the side).

I highly recommend trying this place out, even if you have to go out of your way. Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"I've had their breakfast wrap, BBQ pulled pork burrito and today chicken burrito - everything on the menu is awesome.  This place is (unfortunately) a hidden gem - prices reasonable, real food made in front of you, kind people - everyone working in the area needs to hit this place up once and see for themselves."}
{"text":"Went here twice with friends. They have very good service, staff very accommodating. I couldn't finish one of my pasta dishes, asked if I could get it packed, when I got home found out they added more sauce to my pasta! Lovely! Not authentic Filipino, and food is okay."}
