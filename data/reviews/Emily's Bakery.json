{"text":"Lately I've been disappointed by the quality of pastries and coffee at most bakeries and cafes, but I must give credit to Emily's Bakery for their actually delicious pastries that are not just pretty to look at and almost perfect espresso. I've picked up several items from them and find the high quality of goods consistent which is key for me. I highly recommend their wood oven pizzas (the best!), tiramisu, and zeppole."}
{"text":"This is the best bread in Woodbridge. Their sweets are good too, but St. Phillips is better for that."}
{"text":"My best friend always talk about the best bread etc. So I decided to check out the store. I went with my son we had pizza, pasta and pastries everything is fantastic !! Love the bread, pizza and homemade pasta !!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza, the best coffee and the best service! Go see Sal for a wood oven pizza which tastes like Italy, 7 Stars!"}
{"text":"I hired Emily's Bakery for my daughters' birthday. They catered and delivered warm food as well as pastries to my venue. Sal and his mother were such a pleasure to work with. They are professional, kind and really put heart into what they do. All my guest loved their food and many even packed some treats for their partners. I would highly recommend working with Emily's Bakery for your next event. I know I will :)"}
{"text":"In a Town full of Italiano Bakeries and a handful within driving distance, Emily's Bakery is the least interesting in theme(Market) that doesn't have extra Hoopla that a few others exaggerate in decor.  Minimal is what you'll see with the high ceilings of beige color that's hard to miss because it's half the HEIGHT of the space.

Breads, Frozen Goods, Cans, Dry Pasta, Pastry Display, Prepared Meals, Cafe, etc...  The looks of it is like any other of it's kind and everything looks A-OK however I guess it's just missing a more welcoming factor that even it's neighbouring Italian Bakery across the street has.

The aesthetics however doesn't bother the REGULARS one bit as this plaza is quite popular especially with Parents and Highschoolers within the neighbourhood even when they could have easily choose the competition over Emily's.

The Desserts doesn't seem to be as extensive here.  The Porchetta in sauce seems to look dry but drowned in sauce.  The Cappuccino was a CLASSIC Cappuccino with full foam.   2.5 *Star*"}
{"text":"This place has changed owners 3-4 times since it opened in 2005; and has gone downhill ever since the first owner sold it ... but recently the latest owners have really killed it - it needs a major cleaning first of all! Second, the employees need to actually serve instead of socialize. The pastries are gross ... omg the Bombe were so stale I gagged! 
Sorry but not a good place anymore ..."}
{"text":"I've been going to Emily's for a few years and by far the best Calabrese Buns on earth. As soon as you walk in there is a bread case to the right. In the middle you have Large and small buns. I buy 12 at a time and freeze them. You take out one every day a few hours before you want one, and tastes like the day you bought them. My mom swears by them GOT TO TRY THEM!! Otherwise you're missing out on one of the simple pleasures in life!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing them for a while now every time I visited my daughter's pediatrician in the same strip mall. Finally over the holidays we dropped in for a quick bite to eat over lunch and we weren't disappointed.

The lineup was very long and since the staff speak very little english it wasn't clear to me how the ordering really works. To be fair it was new year's eve and it wasn't just this place that was as crazy busy as a zoo so I cannot really blame them for not being able to pay attention to their customers very well. 

We enjoyed their fresh made to order pizza - cheese and margherita both were done authentic neopolitan style and reminded us fondly of our meals in Florence. Not the exact same taste, but they do come very close. We'll definitely be returning to try more of their hot food selection!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Everything. Service is terrible, incredibly disrespectful and rude staff. Bad quality food, not refrigerated properly. They also serve things leftover from the day before. Furniture in bad condition and tables were dirty. Flies everywhere, EVEN ON THE FOOD! i can't believe how nobody controls this. spend your money elsewhere"}
{"text":"After all the positive reviews I was excited to try this place.. I walked in and was given a blank stare by the workers.. when I asked if I should bag my own pastries I once again received a blank stare as if I should have known better. Very rude.. The bad customer service left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Perfect place to visit for a quality espresso, wood oven pizza, and bakery goods. The catering is also phenomenal! Thank you Sana!"}
{"text":"This place gets 4*s for the cannoli alone!  You don't know how many times I've gotten soggy cannoli at other bakeries in the GTA, so when I do get it, it's a Russian Roulette.  However, that was NOT the case here at Emily's!

Americano was also nice and strong, and can i say *probably* cheaper than Starbucks.

My only complaint is the configuration of the HUGE shelf/fridge right as you walk into the bakery.  It kinda squishes the cash area.  During my visit, there was a bit of a line and it was also roped off which further makes that area awkward to walk around."}
{"text":"The funny thing is, I only ended up coming to this bakery because the one I wanted to go to was closed. Thankfully. Emily Bakery is one of the top bakeries in the area without a doubt. It's not all about decor here as much as it is with other bakeries in the area, but at these prices I don't care either. It's not all about the low cost of things here, the bread is large and the taste of everything in here is phenomenal. The pastries are delectable. I grabbed some pastries and a pizza dough and wasn't expecting much, but I was happily surprised when those met my tongue, my taste buds got spun. 

They also have a cafe in the side of the store, although I've never tried the coffee here, it would definitely go nice with one of those canolli's!"}
{"text":"Pastries were OK. A little dry. Service was bad, lady at the front was rude and had attitude for no reason. Ruined my first and last experience here."}
{"text":"I love Italian Bakery... I love when the air is filled with the smell of bread and baked goods..I love the vibes of a market feel..I love I can get my caffeine fix... 

Emily's Bakery has the usual European baked goods: breads, pastries, sweets. A hot plate station with your cafeteria type of Italian food: veal cutlet sandwiches, pasta, pizza. An espresso bar. Italian groceries. 

My Cafe Latte is A-OK... and it was enjoyable to sit at the back of the store and do some people watching..."}
{"text":"Emily's bakery is approx. a 10 minute walk from home......too close to drive and a perfect distance for walking the dog over and back as a guise to really exercise off the desserts that I'm sure to consume there.

When you enter, you're greeted with a waft of freshly baked breads, the aroma of brewing coffee and the hint of sweetness from their pies/danishes/cookies/strudels. YUM 

During lunch they also have a hot table...perfect for a quick on the go lunch while listening to the hum from the regulars as they talk about their families/jobs/lives. The hot table is reasonably priced and the selection, while not huge, is enough to fill your boots.

Besides the regular fare of baked goods, they also sell lunch meats (this can can quite busy on a Sunday as people stock up for the week), pasta, olive oils, sauces, pesto, etc. Prices are a bit steeper than Grande Cheese for these types of goods..but convenience is reflected in the price.

The desserts are great....it is my go to place when people drop by and one doesn't feel like making something sweet. They are reasonably priced and taste home-made.

Only one small complaint......they used to sell biscotti with a peanut butter centre and another with Nutella in the centre...both which have been discontinued....not sure why as they always flew off the shelves.....please bring them back...they were by far the best biscotti I've had.

This is a great neighbourhood bakery with an emphasis on comfort foods and convenience."}
{"text":"This place has really good espresso. I love stopping by for a quick coffee and always end up getting some bread while I'm there because it smells so good! They've also got this great fried dough doughnut-ish thing with sugar that's beyond amazing. Not the best place for pastries, but the pizza's great. Service is friendly and always quick. Great spot."}
{"text":"They have great cannoli here - creamy and light! 

Prices are a bit expensive. $6.75 for 3."}
{"text":"LOVED LOVED LOVED the pizza. Authentic food and really good staff. Customers seem to be long time veterans who know everyone there! Loved the comfortable homely environment with delicious food! Will definitely go back and bring family over."}
