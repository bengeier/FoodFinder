{"text":"one of the pricier places on highway 7 in markham.  popular for wedding banquets.  food is quite good however if you are willing to shell out.  Have only been here for weddings and they do a decent job."}
{"text":"Bring your big wallet or have someone with a bigger one pay :)  If you can get past the gaudy Hong Kong decor, the food is awesome but dim sum is definitely the better value but if you seek fine Chinese cuisine and for special occasions (birthday, anniversary, etc.) or you want to impress with the banquet then this is the place.  We have celebrated banquet functions at all the top tier Chinese restaurants in the city.  Lai Wah Heen, Dragon Dynasty, Dynasty Chinese Cuisine and Casa Imperial (big brother to this location).   Our family (including wealthy relatives and friends) loves dining out and Chinese cuisine is our specialty.  So the good and bad of this type of dining is the owners, hosts, wait staff and even the janitor knows us by name and we don't wait for tables even when it's packed.  I think we tip too much :P

For top notch places there are only a few restaurants that truly offer the emperor's meal and this is one.  We celebrated my mom's birthday here in May 2010 and for political (family politics) we chose their top menu $1400 per table of 10 (yes, that's not a typo) includes tip and tax but BYOB which unbelievably means pop too.. we're lucky they didn't charge us for water! When it comes to mom we won't go cheap but this was quite over the top. Shark fin soup, abalone, lobster, fish, fancy desserts and all the regular dishes of a 12 course banquet meal.  All very nice but I prefer a much simpler production as you can eat well for a month elsewhere.  not quite a full 5 stars overall but if you plan to do this type of dining it's near the top."}
{"text":"Another place I went to as part of my Canada trip.  The place was inside of a shopping center, and the outside was very deceiving.  I wasn't expecting much, but when I walked inside....WOW.

Whoever decorated this place definitely had Queen Elizabeth and Donald Trump on his/her mind.  Several large chandelier hung from the ceiling.  The walls were gold, and each table was big enough to sit at least 16 people.  The walls were very victorian, and everything was GOLD.  Very GOLD.  The bar was huge!  There was a weird clock sitting in the middle that reminded me of the Godsworth in Disney's Beauty and the Beast.

The dimsum is made to order.  They give you a paper, and you pick what you want to order.  The food was very tasty, and the portion was very large.  Everything was freshly made.  

The downside of this place is the price of the dimsum.  They must of added decoration as part of the dimsum price.  The bill for 12 people came out over $200.  I think this is pretty pricey for just dimsum.  

I probably would come here but then again, maybe not."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to casa Victoria for afternoon dim sum. It is known for luxury dim sum and service. We sure did not get the service. My friend had a VIP card to get 10% off. When the receipt came, we did get 10% off but was charged $3 for a mini plate of SAUCE, which we did not order!! When I asked the waitress, she said that the bill was right and that because we got the discount, we need to pay for the sauce. The discount was $3.36, so technically we got .36 cents off. I said this was not communicated to us and she said why do we need to? All dim sum places are like that. I have dim sum very regularly and I've never had to pay for my sauce. I do not recommend anyone to come to casa Victoria and if you do.. then make sure to check your receipt. Who knows what else they will charge you. Very disappointed. Paid for sauce and got yelled at."}
{"text":"I came here for dimsum on a Saturday morning. We had a reservation but since we were early, there were still quite a few tables available. 

Our overall experience was quite underwhelming. The restaurant is well decorated with a Victorian era theme and waitresses dressed French maid style uniforms, making it a rather classy setting, but don't let these elements fool you. 

The food was very mediocre - for the prices they charge, I expected the quality to be better. The only item that stood out for me was the milk pastry tarts (I can't remember the exact name) - the pastry was light and fluffy, and the filling was delicious. Everything else was very average. 

Unfortunately, the subpar service didn't make up for the food either. It was hard to track down a waitress, whether it was to get our tea refilled to submit a second order sheet. I'd think twice before coming back here."}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided to go to a nice, fancy restaurant for our afternoon tea at Casa Victoria on New Years Day. To our disappointment, this restaurant may look nice and all but the service and food were terrible. 

1) We were standing at the entrance of the restaurant without being acknowledged by any host/hostess or servers. We end up having to stop a random server to ask to be served. 

2) We found HAIR in the tripe dim sum. We asked for the manager and all the manager did was apologize, took away the dish and cancelled the dish off our order. I STILL WANT MY FOOD. I mean, I did order it cause I want to eat it. Yes, there was hair but we didn't get compensated for anything and we didn't get to enjoy the food we want. 

3) We found a PIECE OF PAPER inside the har gow dim sum. We asked for the manager and all he did was \"tsktsktsk\" and sighed. He looked at us and ask what we want from them. WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT WE WANT? If I ask for a free bill will the restaurant comply? Probably not. Clearly, the manager was not professional enough to even apologize and provide us with a resolution. Again, the manager took away the dish and cancelled it off our order. 

4) Bill was provided 10% off BUT they also charged us for spicy sauce (the yellow and red ones) per person. They didn't want to give us the full discount on the tea cost but instead charge us the spicy sauce which cost less compared to tea cost per person. I feel like they are just trolling by giving us these discounts cause we still pay them the 10% tips and our compensation was pretty much $5 for a $110 bill. 

I am very disappointed in the meal as I had to eat in fear there might be extra ingredients in the food. Management clearly did not know how to resolve problems and ensure customer satisfaction. 

Honestly, this place looks nice and fancy, and the food (if no extra ingredient) weren't all that bad. But I would not return ever again for the fact that management did not dealt with the incident well."}
{"text":"Yes, gaudy with lots of shiny bling bling everywhere.  Huge huge crystal chandeliers.  The wood is mostly veneer, the marble and granite are real.  Lots of gold paint.

Also, very expensive.  Likely most expensive dim sum place in markham area.

Then why the 5 stars.  The food is extremely well done.  Attention to detail in the dim sum makes this the best dim sum place in GTA.  In fact, most places in HK don't have dim sum this good."}
{"text":"We hosted a baby shower here and had a horrible experience. Poor service our table had no ice, no beer or soda and when we asked them for it them literally threw it at our table. The way staffs handled food was a hot mess..  didn't clean our plate on time and it kept piling up."}
{"text":"Was there on a recent Sunday.
Very crowded at around 11 AM.
Not very organized at the front.
Dim Sum is not cheap, actually it is quite expensive.
2 adults and 1 teen girl was almost $60.
Most of the dim sum was pretty good especially the presentation was quite alright.
The worst is the steam rice noodle , very thick and not smooth at all.
I will try their sister Shop Casa Imperial."}
{"text":"This place looks like it was decorated by a gothy Donald Trump.  Is anyone really  fan of black, gold, and marble?  Despite the tacky \"high-end\" decor, the service is crisp and efficient, and the food is pretty good.  We go here for dim sum, and if you want to avoid a long wait, plan to get here well before 11:30 on the weekends.  The dim sum is ordered with an order sheet, and the selection is pretty good.  They definitely use the high dim sum prices to pay for all the marble they installed into this place though.  A \"L\" dim sum item is a whopping $6.90!  That's probably the highest price I've seen at a dim sum restaurant. 

However, the food arrives nice and hot, the quality is high, and the service is efficient.  I would give it a 4 star if the prices weren't so high, but it earns a decent 3-star given the quality and taste of the dim sum.

There is a waiting area and hostess station for people waiting for a table, but like all Chinese places filled with impatient Chinese people, the wait spills over well past the hostess station (which is always unmanned) into the dining room.  If you get one of the tables by the door, get ready to have people breathe over your shoulder while you eat.

A note for parents with small babies: stroller friendly if you get one of the tables at the sides, otherwise if you get a table surrounded by other tables, leave the stroller in the car.  The chairs (they did not spend big money of these - a slipcover would hide the hideousness) are just wide enough to put a car seat on somewhat safely without feeling like it would get knocked over by a passerby."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese restaurants go, this is probably one of the best in terms of food and service.  I've had my fair share of Chinese food being a dimsum lover, and am glad to have found a place that delivers hot, tasty plates every time.  I came here for dinner for the first time a few weeks ago and was even more pleasantly surprised to experience real table service at a Chinese restaurant.  Each table had at least 2 servers looking after them with the manager diligently making the rounds table to table helping out to clear dishes and bring food, as opposed to just watching his servers do all the work.  Our casual dinner night felt like banquet service as waiters were on hand through out the night to change our sharing plates and cutlery, ensuring that we were using fresh plates and utensils in between courses.  The specials for the night were indeed expensive, we had a daily fish that was steamed and cost us $120!  However, it WAS cooked nicely, but we perhaps should have asked the price when we had the manager recommend a fish for us.  The Peking duck was a treat and perfectly prepared, and their seafood is fresh and in substantial portions.  You do pay more for food and service here, but it's a nice place with good food and service, however for a place that's also family friendly, it's too bad they don't have baby change tables in the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite dim sum place in the Markham area, their unique take on so many dishes is extremely well executed (although sometimes not consistent).

I give this a 4 star because they just can't seem to get the chicken feet dish right - and this is one of my essential dim sum dishes.

However, they make up for this with their delicious and juicy har gow! Is thick and full of shrimp.  This is also the only chain of dimsum places where you can find the albalone pastry (which is essentially mini a chicken pot pie with albalone)

It may be pricey, but I think this place is definitely worth the price"}
{"text":"only had dim sum. some pretty good food, like the siu mai. the rice noodle roll dishes were the weaker dishes.

the service will mostly ignore you.

lol at the decor"}
{"text":"COMPLETE DIM SUM REVIEW & WEDDING BANQUET REVIEW (3.5/5)

***Dim Sum Review*** 2.5/5

Food Quality & Price: Food quality when it comes to Dim Sum is pretty average.  Not one dish we ordered was \"above expectations\" however, the prices are high. Many dishes are the normally priced at other locations as S(mall) or M(edium) is considered a L(arge) or specialty dish here. Usually Dim Sum at other locations for two total about $15, here for the same amount of food totaled $25.

Facility: As others have said, the decor here is OVER THE TOP for simple Dim Dum meals.  For our wedding banquet (I will discuss later). Generally, okay.  The washrooms have nice decor ... but is a hit and miss.  Sometimes I can get pretty gross. They need to have someone check/clean it more often. 

Service: Slow. Granted they were busy but when we were talking to the manager/director and he told the waitress to clear our table, she nodded and walked away. He had to physically go and grab someone to come do what he had asked after asking three different waitresses to do it. I don't think there was any ONE person who gave us timely service (waitresses, hostess etc) during our brunch. It also took us 15 minutes to get the bill and another 5-10 minutes for change!

Overall: With the slow service, average dim sum food quality and the price, I don't think I would come back to Casa Victoria simply for Dim Sum.  There are much better and cheaper places and alternatives.

***Wedding Banquet Review*** 4/5

Booking Process: We had two consultations with Casa Victoria.  We spoke to David who is the manager. First consultation went well, as we discussed our options, we were attentively served with tea (nice touch). At the first consultation, we worked out price per table (of 10) and the date.  We asked for a few accommodations (a room for the bride to change and keep gifts, a gift box, mic & speaker, and receiving table. Originally David said the mic & speaker were not included, but on the second meeting he threw it in. The process was fairly straight-forward and there is some room for price negotiating.  We paid a deposit and the rest on the day of.

Wedding Food Quality & Price: The food quality was superb.  Real shark fin, real abalone!  My mother's family and friends were happy. I enjoyed the meal very much. The banquet ranged approximately $70-$80 per head drinks not included. 

Day of Service: I didn't have a problem with the service myself (the day flashed by and I barely noticed) but I did have guests complain to me about the waitress/server that was designated to our wedding event.  Apparently she was very cold, sour faced and slow. When serving drinks/food, she was intrusive (without saying excuse me etc) and generally non-receptive when asked for something. I DID notice that she was not very attentive when I realized that our teapots were often empty.  They only placed one at each table of 10? David on the day of was great.  He made sure that the sound system was working and was always within distance if I needed something. David himself was professional at all times, generally good to work with. He did get a lot warmer and receptive after we paid our deposit but kind of disappeared at the end of the night.

Facility and Logistics: As I've mentioned previously, the decor at this location is waaaay too gaudy for simple Dim Sum.  However, my family and mother's friends (older generation) were very impressed by the extravagant interior and the location's reputation. I chose this location 70% based on the lavish design (after being HORRIFIED at another banquet location where we would've been tucked basically into a closet). 

On the day of the banquet, I was given a small room to change in (complete with closet, outlets and mirror). It was nice to have a place to put all our stuff.  It was clean inside, but you had to walk by the entrance to the kitchen which was dirty.  I had to pick up my dress.

Also, Casa Victoria was hosting another, rather large, wedding banquet at the same time as ours.  We were separated into a small room (by those folding wall dividers) but all my guests and to \"walk through\" this other reception to get to ours. Originally they assured us that someone would be at the door to tell my guests where to go, but many of them, confused, sat in on this other wedding for a while before noticing it wasn't the right one. That sucked for everyone (myself, the guests, and the other bride).

Every time I came out of my suite, I had the other wedding reception turn to look at me as I tried to sneak by. We were assured that neither weddings would interfere with each other, but it kind of did.  I know our music/games leaked over, and our guests could hear their wedding speeches.  It wasn't THAT bad, but definitely noticeable. 

Overall: I had a generally good experience and glad I had my wedding banquet at Casa Victoria. I do recommend this location for wedding dinners, just dont' book when there is another party there."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some luxury dim sum experience, this is the one you gotta try. Don't expect any quiet dining environment because everyone talks and laughs a loud and they all enjoy the food~"}
{"text":"It's the night that we come to celebrate the count down for the coming New Year.  We are lucky to get a table as it is all sold out.  The food as usual is above average. But for this night we are not only looking for food quality.  There are bands, singers, games, door prizes, lucky draw and a lot of fun.  The organizer seems to be very handy for this kind of function.  But there are still instances that need improvement such as the slide down curtain for a projector is not down so people at corner cannot have a whole view on the stage.  The other is they have big pot of flowers for the New Year décor that effectively block the view for a lot of tables.  Good that they know later and remove them away.  The singers although not famous but some of them are very good lead by the instructor.

Since it is dim the whole night and so much going on, we do not really concentrate on the food.  But as far as I recall, no bad comment.  

Everyone has a fun night and left after the count down."}
{"text":"This place is expensive for dinner but quite a deal for dim sum, you get fancy and great food all at once, some might say the place looks too done up but I like it, and the food does speak for itself."}
{"text":"Much more expensive compared to typical dim sum places. Food quality is high and service is sometimes slow due to how busy staff are. Also, it is very loud due to the echo from the marble walls. In terms of dim sum quality, it is likely the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"Better than cheap dim sum places but not amazing. The pepper beef dumpling was different and neat. An ok place to go."}
{"text":"I was calling to confirm the reservation and three times someone picked up and they hung up on me like it's nothing. I understand they might be busy but doesn't mean they can hang up on their customer because there's a lot of people. They didn't even bother asking me. And just said hello and after I said I'm calling they just hung up half way. Three times!!!! This is not how they should do business and we used to run a lot of corporate event and meals there but after today I will not go there again!!!! Worst customer service ever! DO NOT RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Very authentic cantonese restaurant! Dim sum and dishes are all good! Only regret is too many people, and the service is so so..."}
{"text":"This is a very very overpriced and pretentious restaurant with food quality only slightly above that of much lower priced cantonese restaurants.  Expect to pay $40-50 per dish versus $8-$20 at say Congee Queen or Congee Wong.  The decor and service are nice, but not worth the price...unless you've got money to burn."}
{"text":"Over-priced, especially since the food was average. Maybe because they were more \"up-scale\", and thus, less dirty in the kitchen (haha) but the food lacked the comfort & greasiness & yummy flavour of less expensive chinese restos.

Only two of us ate and our bill came out to $80 on dim sum alone. So ridiculous."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner once, but I don't really remember it. I usually come here for dim sum.
The decor is overly fancy...chandeliers are everywhere and the gold and shimmer is almost blinding.
It is a lot pricier than most dim sum restaurants (actually, I have yet to go to a more expensive restaurant for dim sum around here), but for a reason: the food tastes better: just the right amount of seasoning, not overcooked or undercooked... even the deep fried stuff tastes better--- it's crispy and not oily. But I wouldn't say that I am always without a doubt willing to pay the extra money. I'm not sure if its worth *that much( more."}
{"text":"Worse of all. I will never come back.
Food is average, depend on what you order. However the price is higher than others. The worst is the terrible and unprofessional staff with bad attitudes services. 
If you don't mind the stone face of the staff, help yourself."}
{"text":"My must go dim sum place every trip in Toronto. Very delicacy dim sum. Especially looove the abalone pastry!"}
{"text":"Found a big ass bug in the veggies that come with beef balls.  See pictures (101 and 102) to see what I'm talking about.  I had pointed this out to the a manager and said sorry and quickly took the plate away before I was able say anything else about it.  Offered no explanation or any sort or compensation whether it be waiving the dish off my bill or offering a discount.

Typical Chinese restaurant shenanigans.  Food here is pricey compared to many other places.

Decor is nice but it is really echo-y in there.  If you have a full house in there, it can be deafening.

Waiting for a spot during prime time is a pain in the ass.  They always give spots to the 'regular/vip' customers.  Well, if you cant even get a spot, its hard for you to become a regular."}
{"text":"Very good dimsum at a slightly higher than average price point.  No specials or deals to be had here, at least not on a Sunday still in the midst of the Lunar New Year.  

We had a table for 8 plus one toddler.  We ordered a variety of 24 dishes and it came out to $20 per person. It was pretty decent considering it included tax and tip.  

It's worth the drive to Markham to eat quality dimsum!"}
{"text":"I know it's a bit pricy, but the dim sum here is fantastic. I also held a wedding banquet here, so I'd say their dinner food is delish as well. It's a clear favourite for consistently good food, and despite being a bit more expensive than other Chinese joints in the area, the margin is well worth it!

Favourites include the deep fried squid (LOVE this stuff, it's like crack to me), the honey pepper short ribs, and the spring rolls. They've also got some delicious pumpkin dumplings every now and then, and their scallop dumplings are really good as well.

This is one of the first places to open up as a \"classy\" Chinese restaurant with a European sort of flair? I should also state that if you go often, you should try and get to know the head servers a bit as they'll end up giving a discount on your dim sum meal usually. Banquet-wise, very little negotiations are to be had, but they've got a decent sized bridal room and a good AV system."}
{"text":"Their dim sum is better than your run of the mill dim sum.  Their shrimp dumplings look like they are on steroids (not that I'm complaining).   Something to keep in mind is that they do take reservations. The decor is lavish but it feels like they are over compensating with the excessive decor and chandeliers.   

However, the price for the value is not worth it.  With a group of 14 friends, we ended up spending $25 per person on a weekend.   I would not come here again for dim sum unless I had extra money to blow.  There's definitely more inexpensive and equally delicious dim sum options in the Markham area."}
{"text":"I havent been to this restuarant for quite a while. It used to be better and more tasty. However during this visit, i find that the portions are smaller. Some traditional dish like the sticky rice in lotus leaf, there are missing ingredients and there was just minced chicken and some sauce, making the dish less tasty and missing favours. The chicken feet are not steamed long enough, therefore its not soft. (Personal preference thats its more soft) 
The environment is very fancy, and the table sets are nice. It wasnt very busy on easter when i came. 

Overall, for the price and the experience. I would not recommend this."}
{"text":"This place has good quality dim sum that uses more higher end ingredients than other dim sum places. I believe this place is associated with Casa Imperial on Warden - as the dishes are similar.

There usually isn't a wait on the weekends if you come before 10:30am. They don't do the set prices before 11a.m. here. All dim sum range from $4 to $10 - depending on what you order. 

This place is on the pricer side when it comes to other dim sum places but you can taste the quality.

One dish that is my favourite is the fried bean curd roll, wrapped in rice noodles. You don't see this dish often and Casa Victoria does this dish very well. Other notables includes the glutinous rice pouch wrapped in a leaf, the preserved egg congee and the siu mai. 

The service isn't as great as Casa Imperial but you can't really expect a lot from Chinese Places. 

For a group of 5 - we spent approx. $80 for about 13 dishes so this place is pricer than most."}
{"text":"This used to be the weekly venue of extended-family-getting-together-over-dim sum place, until my eyes are blinded by mega watts of unmatching chandeliers, gold colours punctuated by purples and pinks, everything is bling bling that makes my head spin.  Okay, maybe not so gaudy.  

Despite over-the-top decor that violates my eyes, the dim sum food is fresh / good quality, pretty nicely presented, and services adequate even during the busies of times.  I appreciate this place much more now that I've traveled around in US and see how people flock to (sorry) gross restaurnats that push out barely edible Chinese food simply because they don't have better choices.  So, 4 stars for the dim sum experience here.  

By the way, this place is supposed to be the poorer cousin of Casa-Imperial Chinese Restaurant and both are owned by the same group.  Shouldn't the poorer cousin tune down the wattage a bit so I don't have to wear sunglasses going back?"}
{"text":"My favourite...expensive dimsum place! My parents always come here and because it's just the 3 of us, the price differential doesn't make that big of a difference. The decor is very stereotypical \"fancy Chinese\" restaurant and is a bit tacky, but you're there for the food right? I like that the ceilings are really high and it's a huge place so everything feels spacious. As always with dimsum restaurants, you have to be prepared that it'll be really loud, full of banging dishes. Compared to most Chinese restaurants, the service is actually pretty good in my opinion. I would definitely take someone for dimsum here, especially if they've never tried it and want a good experience."}
{"text":"I'd been going to Casa Imperial for a while now, so I decided to try out Casa Victoria, but I was very disappointed. I'd made a reservation before, but we still end up waiting 45 mins. Usually when a reservation is made, the next table free is given. We checked in with the hostess when we track her down. She was walking around the restaurant acting like she was extremely busy. Seats were given out with no system. There was so  many people waiting & she wasn't position in the front. Numbers were given out, but I didn't hear any callouts. There were also 3 other managers who were given out seats at the same time. The tables were given to people with relationships or more aggressive. Supposedly, there was one who seems to be in charged of the tables, but she wasn't doing her job.
Finally we got a table, then looked at the dim sum menu & some items were not the same. There was no bbq pork pastry with pine nuts, instead they replace the pine nuts with almond, which is less expensive. So we ordered it anyways because I loved how it taste at CI. However, when I ate it it was another disappointment. It was extremely greasy & it wasn't flaky. It was just gross! The siu mai was not the same as well, it was average, but not worth the price. The har gow, was average too, the outer skin was tasteless, dry & hard.
The fried dumpling was under cook & extremely greasy. The dough was also extremely sticky on the inside. CI makes this dumpling so much better. Overall, this place is not good & I wouldn't go again even though it's the sister restaurant. In terms of dim sum restaurants, there are many more which I enjoyed going to like Legend chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I was here for a typical Chinese Wedding banquet.  Having DJ'd in umpzillion various facilities, I'd say this was alright.  There happened to be another wedding in the same place (divided by a thin wall), and there was a battle of who could be the loudest.  I think the other party won.

This place reminds me of some Chinese interpretation of European decadence that'd easily be found in Shanghai somewhere.  The room was decked out in Gold, and by the time I left I was seeing yellow spots everywhere.

The food was on par with a traditional Chinese banquet menu.  The umpteen courses included the traditional displays of riches: suckling pig, abalone, lobster, shark fin soup.  Abalone was served as an entire chunk as opposed to the thinly sliced version.  Ethics aside, abalone and shark fin is the most overrated food items in the world, and I seriously wouldn't miss it if they were ever taken off the menu permanently.  At a cost of over $100 a kg for abalone, I'd rather take a hunk of prime kobe beef or premium cocaine any day. 

The couple seemed happy with the place and us guests were in fine form which I guess at the end of the day is what really matters."}
{"text":"WORST DIMSUM EXPERIENCE EVER. we waited about 40mins for a table, and one of their \"regulars\" came in and right away got a table beside us. We had to ask multiple times for tea, menu and cutlery, and the person that came in after beside us got tea etc before us. The ribs we ordered were cold. The other food was probably good but it was ruined by their horrible horrible service. Boycotting this place 100%"}
{"text":"The food was decent but definitely pricier than most dim sum restaurants.

The Luncheon Meat & Zucchini Dumpling with Preserved Vegetable was a unique dim sum and hence the reason I picked it.  It was interesting with luncheon meat and zucchini as filling but wasn't too spectacular otherwise.

The Braised Chicken Wing & Chestnut also stood out to me since it's not something I've seen on other dim sum menus.  Although the braised chicken wings were very tender and juicy, it didn't taste of chestnut at all.  There were just two chestnuts and some chopped up mushrooms."}
{"text":"This review was is a little delayed but better now than never.  TRUST me, you would want to read on.

Went here for Mother's Day with a party of 6 people.  The food was terrible.  The flavor lacked and so did the service.  Found a WORM in our pea leaves dish.  They hurried to remove the dish from the table but offered no apology or compensation.  They simply said \"sometimes, worms cant be avoided because they are hidden in the leaves\".... wthat the?!  Speechless...

Needless to say, 5 of the 6 or us got sick (vomit and diarrhea) within the next two days of the dinner."}
{"text":"Expensive dimsum but worth every penny. I can't get enough of eating dimsum here. The jumbo Harcaow and tasty rice shrimp rolls are to die for. But be aware, you will line up a long long time if you happen to walk in without a reservation on the weekends. Its mad packed. I suggest you either go there at 11am sharp to grab a table or goodluck landing a table after 12noon. The price is roughly $4-5/dish ... hence why I say it can get pretty expensive depending on how many you order. And dimsum you usually end up ordering more then 10 mini dishes anyway. Even my family and friends from asia tell me this is still better then back home. So with that being said, I say dimsum here is worth the drive and the cost. Oh and the ambiance is a little confusing. It looks like someone puked out gold everywhere, but I think that was what they were going for when they designed the aesthetics of the place. LOL. It's an \"asian style\" high tea I suppose."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, family, and I came here for dim sum/brunch before heading to our next destination. We arrived around 11-11:30 and it was about 10-15 minute wait for a table of 13. We had a person in our party that was handicap so it took a while to find a table to fit all of us and unfortunately there was no table to fit all 13 of us so our party was split into two separate tables.

Casa Victoria is very large, elegant, and classy with decor that's very Victorian! The waitresses and waiters were all dressed in a Victorian-like uniforms. Too bad the pleasant decor doesn't match up with their attitude. The staff was a bit snotty and rude. 

This was my first experience with a Hong Kong style dim sum where you can place the quantity of each item that you want and the staff will bring it to you. So we had the following -

Shu Mai - These shu mai were very meaty, tasty, and fresh! The quality was a lot better than the ones here in New York. 

Beef Rice Noodle Roll (Gnow Cherng) - This is one of my favorite dim sum dishes, but too bad I didn't quite enjoy these. These were a little small compared to the ones I have in New York and didn't taste too fresh.

Spare Ribs - The spare ribs were really yummy, seasoned just perfectly! It was really tender.

Lotus leaf sticky rice - I didn't try these, but they came in a set of three and looked very small. 

Scallion Pancake - I never had scallion pancake during dim sum, so this was my first time. It wasn't as crunchy or fresh as I hoped.

Roast Duck Noodle Soup - We also ordered a roasted duck with noodle soup. The roast duck was mediocre, not as good as the ones in New York. However, the noodle soup was really good as well as the broth.

Snow Pea Leaves Dumpling - I really liked these dumplings. They were folded so beautifully and tasted amazing. It was filled with snow pea leaves, mince carrots, and mushroom. Good item for vegetarians.

Chicken Feet - This is one of my favorite menu items when I have dim sum, but the chicken feet from Casa Victoria didn't taste very fresh nor delicious at all. 

Another point I would like to bring up is that this restaurant doesn't serve coffee or iced coffee which is a total bummer!

I was hoping for a good experience at Casa Victoria, but no such luck. The staff needs improvement in their people skills and the way they speak to customers and food quality needs a slight improvement. I think next time I return to Canada, I may not return here as I am eager to try other restaurants, but also because the quality of the dim sum wasn't superb."}
{"text":"Decadent, opulent and garish - Brought by the same folks that run Casa Imperial and Crown Princess, Casa Victoria is equally as garish and over the top as it's sisters.  One wonders if the ghost of Gianni Versace has decided to inhabit dimsum restaurants instead of fashion houses.

Packed to the rafters as it is, expect frenetic if unfriendly service.  - no surprise there, really.

The food however, is worth the drive; in a word - fantastic!  We had a few standards as well as a few different items and each one surprised us in its deliciousness.  Even my usually fussy mother didn't balk at the prices AND I didn't hear the usual utterance \"wah... expensive but not as good as so-and-so\".  
Casa Victoria is further evidence that really great dimsum can't be found downtown.  Trust me, it's worth the drive to Markham! (or Richmond Hill for that matter...)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I frequent this place once a month or so as it's close to her work.  If you are looking for cheap, don't come here! If you are looking for a non-traditional type dim sum, try it.  

Almost every dish is absolute perfection.  The jumbo har-gow are really jumbo and very tasty.  The siu-mai are big and good too.  They have a lot of non-typical dim sum (papaya milk pie, I can't remeber the rest) and I would say 50% is non typical and the other 50% is typical.  It is a very elegant, classy restaurant and it feels like you are dining with royalty (look at some of pictures of the teapots).  

I don't remember much about this place as I haven't been here in a while, but now I want to go again...dangit...hate it when I'm bored, start writing reviews of food and get hungry."}
{"text":"This is the first time here for dinner. Today is Mother's Day. The menu is little small but it's the occasion. The food is pretty good and the service is very good too."}
{"text":"If Casa Victoria was a Disney princess, she would be the evil stepsister. A testament to the fact that money can't buy you class. 

Despite the opulent decor and fine dining title, the service was thoroughly disappointing. Without apology or explanation, we were ushered to a table that still hosted the previous patrons' dirty dishes. After being left alone of what felt like an eternity in a graveyard of chicken feet remains, a waitress finally came by to change the plates and cutlery. Of which she basically threw at us. If we were at a typical dim sum restaurant, I would just be happy that I managed to dodge the flying chopstick that came my way. But it should be a different story when you are paying a premium for the promise of grandeur. 

If it weren't for the decent food, this place would be a lone star star tale. We had the:
Purple potato & prosciutto roll - Get in ma bellyy, you delicious creamy and salty goodness encased in a deep fried yet light and crispy shell
Scallop rice noodle roll- Excellent scallop to rice noodle ratio
BBQ eel tart - I know, the name sounds so promising. But unfortunately, it failed to deliver as the bread-like pastry overpowered the eel
Duck feet wrap - I got confused when I was eating this. How can we eat it as a wrap when there's bones inside the duck feet?
Oxtail - Mehh. But then again- once you go Mainsha, you can't go back. 
Milk tart with swallow nest- Mehh.
Papaya and milk pie -Amazing. Imagine milk custard with pieces of papaya tucked in a warm bed of flaky pastry and covered by the crumbly top of a pineapple bun. If I ever came back here again, it would be to order 50 more of these.

To conclude: Decent food if you're looking for more unique dimsum items, but have no expectations that you will be treated like loyalty."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant for dim sum. I come here quite frequent with my family at least once or twice a month. The food is always consistent and flavourful. This is hands down one of the best dim sum joints in Markham. I highly recommend either coming early , making a reservation or come after 1 as it often gets super busy on the weekends. Some of my favourite dishes would include shark fin & seafood wrap in soup (for 1 person only), super har gow, Sui Mai, spare ribs with taro in preserved black bean, chicken feet with cho-hou sauce, baked bbq puff with almond, cuttlefish tentacle with salted spice, pan fried short ribs with honey sauce, and the milk tart with swallows nest. Be sure to try all these items, you will not be disappointed! The dinner menu is quite good as well. In terms of pricing, it is more in the higher price range for dim sum. Ranges from $5-10 per dish. The staff are pleasant as well, if there is something wrong just let them know!"}
{"text":"A place with a nice set up in good location. I am sure that is also the only reason they are doing good profit. Comparing to other Chinese restaurants in the area or in Toronto, the food is really pricy for what you get. Also, the services were poor and definitely inadequate to what we were paying."}
{"text":"??????????????????feel????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Classier dim sum place. It's a nice place, but a little more expensive. Try some other places first, unless you're trying to impress..."}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant to Casa Imperial and they are both considered classy & expensive when it comes to Chinese food.  The ambiance again, like Imperial, is full of chandeliers.  A good looking restaurant for sure!

As for the food, the day before - I had just made a visit to Casa Imperial so my food experience here was just mediocre.  The prices are 2-3 times more expensive than most dim sum places in the city - I guess I expected more.  Or at least more on level with Casa Imperial.  The food was decent but not mind blowing.  They didn't use the same quality ingredients as Casa Imperial.

I'd rather go to a cheaper place for the same kind of food, but for a special occasion, the decor in here makes up for it."}
{"text":"We have not been here for a while for dinner.  Not sure why considering we come here a lot for dim sum-good place but lots of people (and potential long wait time).

Unlike lunch when it's packed, dinner was a quiet, unrushed and comfortable affair (which is my preference).   Seating was spacious and service polite and prompt.

We picked a \"set dinner\" and added a few extra dishes.   They actually had a lot of set choices which is good since it saves me the trouble of thinking about a \"base\" meal.   Pricing ranges from high to higher (but seriously it's typically for this type of restaurant and food).

The quality and taste of the food was good and was cooked well.   The timing when the food come was good so we did not feel rushed.  Servers portioned everything for us and also transferred food from big to smaller plates so our table was not jammed packed.   Definitely a good choice for premium Chinese cuisine especially if you have a lot of people in your party."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to try this place out since it's been in the area and we haven't tried it before. It's a bit pricier in terms of Chinese restaurants so we expect it to have great quality service and food. 

When I went in, the hostess asked how many and I said two. Then she said ??, which is a rather rude way to say \"come here\", similar to \"get over here\". She should have said please follow me. And she didn't even motion for me to go with her, just expected me to go with her. 

The tea itself was very mild in taste even after 4 refills. I understand it takes time to steep but taste should come forth after 2 refills. 

The dim sum was on par, if not worse, than NKS banquet restaurant. Food was average taste. Siu mai has conpoy which I suppose is interesting but there is no need for it. It falls off and you can't combine it with the pork taste. The shrimp rolls usually do not have chives... But their recipe calls for it. 

What I disliked is the squid and scallop Siu mai wrapped in seaweed. It doesn't need that much... Goo? To keep it together. The tastes did not mix well with each other, and the portion was small. 

Would not recommend, despite their teapots and utensils were pretty. I do appreciate they didn't have chipped utensils."}
{"text":"We came here for a wedding reception, so my review is based solely on banquet style dinner.

The space itself is typical of Cantonese style banquet restaurants: a bit gaudy with lots of red and gold accents. Furnishings were reflective of that too. Wait staff dressed cleanly and professionally in black and red garments, and all were very well disciplined. The operations really reminded me of how wait staff is overseas in China.

Anyhow, we arrived around 6:30pm for the start of the dinner reception, and it was very easy to locate the banquet room. They portion off the left side to the banquet room, and then the right side is the main dining room. The location of the restaurant itself is next to No Frills market, and is hidden to the left side, so just keep your eye out once you enter the plaza.

We were seated, and dinner service started within 20 minutes. Typically, when you go to Chinese banquet restaurants, the flow and start of dinner gets pushed back often. However, Casa Victoria did not have this issue, and we were super happy about that. We were STARVING by the time dinner rolled around, so I'm glad the staff read our minds to feed our tummies. :)

Dinner consisted of a 12-course banquet dinner. It started off with the half roasted suckling pig. Ordinarily, I'm not a huge fan of eating animal skin since it's too fatty and greasy. However, the skin on the pig was crispy and not too thick. It was well-balanced with the moist texture of the meat.

We then had the a stir-fry dish consisting of prawns, chicken and fish fillets, sugar snap peas, and  fried bird's nest. Again, not greasy and well seasoned, probably one of my favorites of the night. Though the flavor was chicken-based, there wasn't any of that artificial chicken essence that a lot of Chinese restaurants use.

The next few courses consisted of braised abalone with mushrooms and baby bok choy, broccoli with dried scallops stuffed in squash, abalone seafood soup, roasted crispy chicken, lobster with ginger and scallions, steamed green bass in a soy ginger scallions sauce. All were consistently good, but our favorites were the braised abalone with mushrooms and veg, steamed fish, and chicken. Lobster would have been a home run had it not been overcooked.

The end of the night was sweetened with some fried rice in a tomato sauce, braised E-Fu noodles, and red bean soup with orange peel. Staff in the beginning were a bit rushed, and cleared plates at a pretty rapid pace, but after the first 2 courses, they slowed down a bit, and the pacing was good. Each personnel was friendly, and kept refilling the tea pots at a good rate.

We had a lovely experience here, not only because it was for our friends' wedding reception, but the staff did an excellent job handling the 10 tables of hungry guests. :) Food was fresh and light with great flavors.

Next time, I'd be interested to try their dim sum menu, but I'd give a solid recommendation for this place if you're planning on hosting a big dinner event."}
{"text":"A Post-Wedding banquet dinner to honor the newlywed couple was held on a Sunday night.  The banquet dinner ?? (hei2 zau2) was lovely and delicious treat in traditional Chinese Cantonese banquet of twelve (12) courses is certainly abundance.  Quality of food is very good.  Based on memory, our large party occupying seven (7) tables with lazy Susans indulged on:

Roasted suckling pig with jelly fish was very lovely
Shark's fin soup with crab meat
Deep fried crab claws
Stuffed conches with chopped up conch meat, celery, bamboo shoots
Crispy fried chicken ???  (zaa3 zi2 gai1) and prawn crackers ?? haa1 (xi? piàn) pin3 (pian4)

Fish - sea bass
Banquet fried rice
Stir fried egg noodles

Dessert:
Red Bean Soup ??? hung4 dau6*2 saa1 (hong2 dou4 sha1)
Tea pastries ?? filled with mocha sweet black sesame paste

Waiter service is attentive.  This restaurant is equipped with a microphone for couples and their parents to make announcements and a overhead projector screen play videos and photos from one's laptop on a loop.  Unfortunately, there were small flies floating around during our entire meal probably fungus gnats which were very annoying as we enjoying our feast.  This restaurant is the sister to Casa Imperial.  It is the standard grand ballroom Chinese banquet style restaurant.  The chandeliers are very ornate.  Like any Chinese restaurants, BYO alcohol (beer and wine only) is practiced, however Casa Victoria does provide wine glasses.  Facilities are relatively clean.  A parking lot is available on site.  Restaurant is street level which is accessible for patrons using cane or walker."}
{"text":"The sister of Casa Imperial, but more like the ugly step sister. A nice setup but the decor is a bit more gaudy. The typical grand ballroom style of traditional dim sum restaurants, one big room with tables.

The dim sum is kinda like Casa Imperial, but not as tasty with a few of the better items missing. Prices aren't that much cheaper so if you're in the mood, just go to Casa Imperial. Easy choice."}
{"text":"Overrated. You've lost my vote as a restaurant to come back to. Number one, as we walk in, you walk by us without any greeting. Yet you treat your usual customers with more preference. Number two, your food is higher priced yet it's mediocre. Yeah...So you have some fancier stuff on your menu...SOOOO WHAT???  Number three, it takes you awhile to come and refill our tea pots.  Come on, your restaurant isn't even full yet during the time we were there.  Number four, not one 'thank you' after we paid and when we left. WTF??? Sorry...You FAIL in my books.  P.S. If choosing a place for a wedding reception, avoid this restaurant. Parking will be horrendous for your guests since it's a shared lot with NO FRILLS and TD CANADA TRUST."}
{"text":"If you love Dinsum, you have to come to this place. Any kind of food is good. A must visit restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times to celebrate bdays and other special occassions with my family.  My bro loves this place so he likes to come often and from that he became friends with the manager.  why do i tell you this?  because it helps to know the managers when there is a 2 hour wait for DIM SUM and you show up...BAM! a table.  it means nothing but when you are in that situation you love it LOL the DIM SUM is awesome here you get huge portions and the quality is pretty high end.  Same with dinner the service and quality of food are great.  You won't find the greasy foods here but the flavour is great."}
{"text":"My parents are regulars at this restaurant and so we come here often for dim sum or dinner. Like most reviewers wrote about my place, the food is on the pricier end but their service and attentiveness to your needs are impeccable. However, with regards to the food standard... I feel the standard has gone down quite a bit. 

Today, I was here for dim sum and the fried rice that we ordered tasted waaaaaaaay over salted. The other dim sums were alright, nothing in the flavours \"wow-ed\" me.

I read that a reviewer waited a while for a table. I would attest that you do need some sort of connection with the waiter/waitress not to get stuck waiting forever while others--who came after-- get a table before you. This is especially true during the weekend and special holidays."}
{"text":"Party of 3 came for dimsum around 10:30am and it was about half empty. They don't have any specials for dimsum before a certain time, so it's always fairly expensive - expect around $5.5 per item on average. Their tea is okay, not amazing, but it fits the bill. There isn't a huge variety of dimsum, and a lot of their items seemed to be dressed up - with things like abalone sauce or birds nest, etc. They do have a small rotating list of about 6-10 items that pop in and out regularly. Their noodles and rice dishes are available for order in the afternoon and are on the expensive side, around $15 minimum. 

The ambiance and service is what used to stand out remarkably about this place, but unfortunately, it's significantly deteriorated since the last time we came. The tables were so jam-packed together, we could literally hear the tables next to us and we could barely hear ourselves talking. Service was rather poor - we struggled to flag down a waitress when we needed to and they all seemed very annoyed."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, this place would easily deserve it! Apparently rudeness is a fine quality they look for when hiring their staffs. After waiting for more than an hour for a table, we noticed they started calling out numbers after us. They claimed they called our number several times in the waiting area, which is FULL of people. Knowing that there are people waiting a bit inside the restaurant and outside, wouldn't it be logical that you go around to call the numbers, or use that microphone? But apparently it's still my fault for not assigning one of my party members designated to crowd around the \"actual\" waiting area to listen for our number. Thank you for that lesson, but let me teach you one too: respect your customers, maybe it might help your restaurant's business- no wonder you guys are losing business to other competitors around the area."}
{"text":"We stopped here again for a late lunch and the food is better than any other place I tried for Dim Sum.  (I've been to 10 or 12 places in T.O.)
 
The service is very fast and the place is really well maintained. I like that.

The only drawback today was that we were a little late and at 3:15 they change the setup from lunch to dinner and that means that the entire staff is moving tables and floating walls, setting chairs and tables and such... Made me feel like I had to leave.

Still a great lunch."}
{"text":"Solid food, dim sum is fresh, clean, tasty, authentic cantonese. Typical noisy lunch hour crowd and packed, just don't get seated near entrance. Great fried squid and hargow is huge."}

we ordered the set meal where each dish comes out one by one.

roasted pork & jellyfish
shrimp & fish belly & veggie
sea cucumber & veggies
soup
abalone & broccoli (i loved this!)
lobster
fried fish
chicken (marinated with sweet soy sauce)
rice & noodles
desserts

i'd recommend this set. very delicious! (especially the abalone and the chicken) :)
service was great. only down part about it is that the dishes came out in long intervals."}
{"text":"1st time here for dim sum. Wasn't really welcoming when we enter the doors. Two employees walked by us without saying anything. One looked like she was management or someone that takes reservations at the podium. There was no one at the podium. And she was just walking around watering the plants around the front door and near the podium. I looked at her a few times she just ignored my glare. We waited for someone to acknowledge our party. Finally someone within the restaurant asked us how many ppl. 

The place was overall nice and clean and very well lit with the fancy chandeliers. It was bright with the contrast of the golden decor. 

We marked off a few items, saw some fancy high end items, but we went basic. 

Ha Gow~ Big in Size at least 2 full shrimps inside. Not bad in flavour. Wished there was bamboo shoots to compliment the shrimps. 

Siu Mai~ Huge in Size as well. Had some dried shredded pork on top of each dumpling. Taste was there but a bit strong on the msg.

Fried Dough Wrapped with Steamed Rice Roll & Crusted Cashews~ Nothing special just basic and a sprinkle of cashews. 

Chiu Chow Fun Gao~ Tasty wasn't bad. Decent Size and Filling was packed. 

Lotus Leaf Sticky Rice~ Flavour was there but it was a bit salty for me.

Pan Fried Turnip Cake~ Again really salty and too much rice flour. Was really stiff.

Yellow & Green Chive Spring Rolls~ Took forever to get our last item. It was alright but nothing special. 

We also had our teapots open for indication that we needed a refill. Took a long time doing that too. It's like they didn't even want our business. No smile, no thank you for paying, no goodbye when we walked out. No goodbye from the lady at the podium too. 

I would not like to be at a restaurant that doesn't welcome new customers and only favours their regulars only. Not returning for sure."}
{"text":"Called in to order suckling pig and they told me it was $22 over the phone. Got there and it wasn't ready and so I wanted to pay and do some grocery shopping first. Then I saw $42! And asked how many lbs and the waitresses didn't know. Just shrugged. Stupid me paid and got this when I got back from No Frills.

It's crispy and tasty but $42?!
Mother warned me not to go. Always listen to your mother. 

Lack of communication and I just got legally robbed."}
{"text":"A slightly more expensive dim sum and dinner place; I came here both for dim sum and dinner (in a span of two days).  The decor is really... really gaudy. lol

Dim sum: the portions are pretty big and it's more expensive than other places, but the quality of food is pretty good.

Dinner: try their roasted dove/pigeon - it's very good. The quality of food is pretty good, but just a warning: the prices added up!  Came here for a dinner with my parents and two of their friends and it might've been more worth it if we got one of their set meal combos.  Regardless of how expensive the bill was, it was still pretty good food."}
{"text":"Good quality dim sum. Favorites were the Pork & Preserved Egg Congee w Snow Pea Leaf, Baked BBQ Pork Bun and Papaya Milk Tart. The XO Scallop Rice Roll needs work - the rice roll was too thick & not smooth. 

The downside is the very high price."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of coming here for a golf tournament banquet. I can't remember how many courses we had but it was a lot, including Peking Duck to start, Tiger Shrimps with Broccoli, Crispy Chicken, and much more. Each dish was presented and served by a server. Very good service. Good tasting food too!

The decor of the restaurant was elegant and very upscale. There was a stage that was used for awards presentations but would be perfectly suited for a head table at a wedding. There was also a very large screen and projector above the stage.

Overall, very good experience."}
{"text":"I came for dim sum based on the rave reviews.  Maybe my expectation was set high, or maybe the food had gone downhill, I wouldn't say I was a fan of the dim sum here.  The food tasted good, as in they tasted exactly the way they were supposed to.  These were classic dim sum done right.  The ingredients were of good quality.  

The prices were really high.  A large dim sum costed over $6.  You thought you could order small and medium dim sum instead?  Not really.  Many popular and traditional items were denoted as large dim sum.  The result was a much higher than average cost per person, just to be full.  The price premium is beyond the food quality and service quality premium."}
{"text":"I've come here for dinner recently and had a really good meal. It's pricey (think $180 for 6 people) but everything tasted wonderful. Service was also very attentive. If you're looking for good quality Chinese food for a special occasion, this place doesn't disappoint. You may want to drop in or call them for their set menus and special occasion / wedding menus as well."}
{"text":"Considering the prestige and upscale design of this restaurant, the service and food certainly didn't match the quality.

I came here with my mom and dad on a weekend at around 3pm, and the place was still 3/4 full. We ordered a large range of dim sum and tried to see if the quality matches places like Dragon Boat.

There were some unique dim sum dishes, such as the milk tart with swallow's nest and abalone puff with conpoy. Both these dishes are actually quite good, and I would definitely order them again. Their siu mai doesn't come with fish roe, but instead comes with shredded dried pork...unfortunately I felt this wasn't a good combination and I didn't like the aftertaste of it. All the other dim sum dishes I ordered were, sadly, nothing memorable, and given the high price of this place I definitely prefer Dragon Boat.

Service was poor. We weren't situated in a good area of the restaurant, so the time it took to wave a server down was extremely long. However, more than one server kept forgetting to perform our requests, such as forgetting to return the teapot after refilling and needing to wait 10 minutes for the bill to come.

For what it's worth, the food is decent, and if price is something you can overlook you will like this place. However, with the price standard I expect the quality similar to or above Dragon Boat. It wasn't the case, and honestly I don't see myself returning here for the time being."}
{"text":"Good consistent Dim Sum. Delicious! One particular server Sophia is really friendly and pleasant. Look for her as she gets things done ASAP.  She's very well spoken.  Would come back."}
{"text":"Dim sum was very good in a glamorous European decor. The snow pea leaves with pork and preserved egg congee was memorable; lots of leaves, pork, egg and hot enough to taste great but not burn your tongue. The shrimp cheong fun (with yellow chives instead of snow pea leaves) tasted different and very good.  The sui mai and dumpling were good"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on Mother's Day and had the worst dining experience.  

When we first arrived at 8:30pm, there were clearly over 10 tables that were unseated (and no one else was waiting for a seat) and the hostess told us to wait for a seat.  About 10 minutes passed and we went to the hostess and asked if a table was ready and she looked like she just remembered we were still here and quickly guided us to a table that wasn't even setup (so the 10 min we spent waiting clearly wasn't for the table setup).

A waiter began setting down our dinnerware as we sat down and we found majority of our bowls and spoons were covered in old food stains and bits, cups had old tea leaves stuck to the bottom and one of our cups even had an old lipstick print stuck to its rim. This is extremely disgusting to say the least.  When we told one of the managers about this, he simply shrugged and walked away with NO APOLOGIES! 

Next, we proceeded to placing our order and realized they were on a special revised Mother's day menu for the evening. We understand they are trying to streamline their services for the day, but the pricing on their \"special dishes\" were extremely ridiculous. One of the dishes we ordered was Chinese broccoli with shrimp and scallops. Can anyone guess what the price is and the size of this dish?  

The dish was only 10\" in diameter and was priced at $34.88 with just four shrimps, four scallops, and about 6 Chinese broccoli stalks (with no leaves) on the dish. We asked one of their managers about this and the manager shrugged and said, \"I'm not responsible for this, the kitchen determines the size and pricing.\" 

We do not recommend this place at all because of the following reasons: 
-  unclean dinnerware and utensils (sanitary concerns)
-  there is no hot water in the washroom (be prepared to wash your hands in cold water only - can't imagine doing this in the winter)
-  their staff simply don't care about the business and no one takes ownership of issues that are brought up by customers
-  bad service
-  long wait time even though the place is not full and no one else was waiting in line
-  pricing is ridiculous as this place will gouge your wallet empty

So please think twice next time before stepping foot into this place!"}
{"text":"My family lives around the corner from them and I have been a regular patron since they opened up about 10 years ago but I will never step foot in there again. 

I waited about 40 minutes with my giant 11 month old baby in my arms and watched the hostess accept red envelopes filled with money and seat other people before me. 

If you're not prepared to slip Shirley (the hostess) some money for a table, avoid like plague."}
{"text":"There are dim sum restaurants that may have a dish or two that's better than casa victoria's but the service is poor, or another that might have cheaper dim sum but the atmosphere is dirty -- but overall Casa Victoria has all the positive qualities you're looking for when you want to enjoy a cup of tea and dim sum with family and friends! Making it my favourite dim sum restaurant! The quality is always very consistent, there's plenty of interesting dishes as well as classic dim sum, the service is professional, and the golden theme/chandeliers make you feel like royalty (well....atleast I do haha)!!! What else can I ask for?

I went to Hong Kong a few months ago, and perhaps I didn't go to an extravagant dim sum place, but I feel like Casa Victoria is up to par or BETTER than the restaurants there. Us Markham people aren't missing out on yummy dim sum cause we've got one RIGHT HERE!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. The food is okay but the service was awful. They actually stand next to you to count how much tips you give them. There are way better dim sum places to go to. Stay away. Do not come here unless you want horrible service."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday morning with a few friends. It's more expensive than other dim sum places around the area. 

Usually at other places when you go before 11:00am they have a deal where small, medium and large dishes are all the same price, which is usually around $2.50-$3.50. However at this place there's no deal- it's $4-$6 for any size dish!  

The food taste like any other dim sum place. It's good quality ingredients and delicious. The portions are quite large too and they have a great variety of dishes. 

The restaurant is decorated to give off the vibe of a classier dim sum place, with the theme of the Victoria era. 

There's minimal interaction with staff as they just seat you, grab your order, then drop off the food. 

To avoid waiting I would recommend coming early (before 11am) as many people in the area come before then."}
{"text":"It is an OK place. I'd say everything is on average, including
- quality of food, typical Chinese Dim Sum taste, not bad but no surprise
- environmentally, It is kind of noisy but as expected.
- service is not impressing, and that's the main reason I am giving two points. Service is too slow considering the whole place was not that full. Another example reflecting the service, we asked for a cup of warm water but a waitress said they only had hot or cold water. Come on! I don't think a robot is smarter than a waitress, but it is simply that she was not considerate at all. 
- Lastly price. Although credit card is accepted, the price is kind of high, especially no discount before 11am, compared to many other Dim Sum places in GTA.

I am not recommending this place, because there are quite a few options around this area in reasonable driving distance."}
{"text":"My companion and I just stumbled across this place by accident. From the outside, it's hard to tell what is inside--unless you read Chinese. The sign says Case Victoria, Fine Dining, and then there's some lettering in Chinese. Maybe they do have \"fine dining\" at some portion of the day, but when we were there in the early afternoon, it was Chinese dim sum.  Every dish we ordered was excellent. My companion doesn't eat meat or chicken, so it was challenging to find things that suited her. But she does eat seafood, so we managed to find 6 excellent dishes and had leftovers to take home at the end. Cost for the 6 dishes came to about $38."}
{"text":"I prefer Casa Victoria any time over her sister Casa Imperial anytime.

Though both dolled up in lavish gold with European flare, but Casa Victoria feels more spacious and just less claustrophobic.

Service here is attentive and professional. 

Price wise is a little more than other Chinese restaurants but is worth coming here for special occasion.

All the food we ordered were well prepared with quality ingredients and all were A-OK. 

- Roasted Peking Duck 2 Ways
- BBQ Suckling Pig with Jelly Fish
- Seafood Hot Pot in Rum Sauce
- Beef Tenderloin and Cashew in Maggi Sauce
- Fried Sticky Rice w/ Conopy & Preserved Meat

I definitely will be coming back and maybe come here for dim sum?"}
{"text":"WOW...the decor is brilliant! 
We ordered the Pork chop with Peking sauce 14.99 (yummy and lots of meat)
Crab leg and fish tummy soup $8 pp
Spice beef 
When we finished, they have free red bean soup, mango pudding and sticky rice ball, which were very tasty

{"text":"Great place for Sunday dim sum. The hostess is pretty tough and you can expect to wait a while for a table, but the food comes quickly. The ribs with honey lemon sauce and the soy quail were both great, as were the seafood dumplings. Four of us ate upwards of a dozen or so dishes and it only broke to $25 per person. Great deal."}
{"text":"The food was alright but for the price and the portion size.. It wasn't worth it. Food aside, our dinner experience was completely ruined by the extremely rude service. Definitely won't be coming back here. The waiter who took our order was curt, and the waitresses who brought us our dishes completely ignored us (while continuing her conversation with her co-worker!) The lady taking our payment also seemed extremely annoyed to take our card. I've never experienced such rudeness at a restaurant before."}
{"text":"Casa Victoria is another pricier dim sum restaurant, but well worth it (in my opinion). Luckily, I was here with my mom, which compelled me to be more cost-conscious while ordering (which means I try to stick to S or M items). I also had the sense to make a reservation, so we didn't have to wait long for a seat. 

I reluctantly ordered the super jumbo har gow dumpling to take home for my boyfriend. I say reluctant because har gow here is an XL item, and costs a whopping $6.90. It was the most expensive item of my meal. The dumplings themselves were certainly not jumbo in size, but I guess the shrimp inside was. I ate a piece, and it was tasty, but not worth $6.90 in my opinion.

In contrast, my order of rice noodle rolls in XO sauce was way larger in portion, and it was actually cheaper than the har gow ($6.50). The XO sauce was delectable!

Deep fried taro dumpling- a thin layer of mashed taro encasing rich, meaty filling- was another small item, to my delight. It was another excellent execution. 

Deep fried meat and chives bud dumpling- an absolute delight! I loved the combination of the sweet, chewy dough and savoury pork filling. The deep fried dumpling skin, made from sticky rice, was particularly tasty.

BBQ Pork buns- these were delicious! The bun was light and fluffy, and the filling was hearty and sweet. I think these buns converted me into liking char siu bao. 

For my sweet tooth, I ordered milk pie with papaya, and they were just so darn delicious! These mini delights were topped with a crumbly eggy sugar dough, similar to the top layer of Chinese pineapple buns. The milk filling was a creamy complement to the pastry. 

I loved everything I ordered, especially the BBQ buns and dessert! I would certainly come back for more!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nicer than a lot of other Chinese restaurants and service was quick. It's a la carte and you order dim sum by checking off a piece of paper. It's a more expensive dim sum place relative to other ones in the area. It ranges from $4-$7 for a dish depending on the size. 

The rice noodle wrapped shrimp was advertised to be \"jumbo\" size but was pretty small, not that great for $7 so I would skip out on that. My favourite would have to be the chicken feet or the siu mai. The portions are decent for their other dim sum dishes and very tasty as well."}
{"text":"In the span of two hours, we got 5 plates out of the 12 plates we ordered for a party of four. Followed-up with them 3 times in the process. Other tables around us got their food in a timely fashion. 

We asked to cancel the rest of our order and I overheard the staff talking with one of them saying \"they can't cancel it\" (uh yes we can) Finally a manager was notified and it seemed like he was running around trying to figure out what went wrong - we just wanted to pay for what we ate and leave.

When the bill came, they charged us for three items we did not get. While I was in the process of explaining this to the manager, he was ready to argue back but realized he was wrong in the end. No apology, no explanation. We went to another restaurant to eat afterwards because no real human being can be full from sharing 5 plates with 3 other people."}
{"text":"Pretty good quality dim sum here . The pieces are extra large . Compared to downtown dimsum restaurants this is better than most."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate Chinese New Year with my grandpa and some other relatives. This restaurant is known to be higher class and one of the better dimsum restaurants in Markham. It is a very comfortable restaurant with nice seating, lavish decor and lots of fancy chandelier type lights. The Dim sum is good here, every dish had good quality and fresh ingredients. The shrimp in the har gow ate huge, the fried dishes like chow mein was average though. Service is excellent and they attend to you right away. I came here with a toddler though and they actually didn't have high chairs or a proper booster seat though, so I recommend bringing your own. It is on the pricier side though if you compare it to other dimsum places in Toronto, around $5 a dish. We really liked the milk egg tarts which were made freshly for us that day. The papaya layered cake was also good. I also enjoyed the congee with clams which had the sweetness of the clams there. Some other items were not as different or significant as other dimsum places like the BBQ pork bun or the beef Cheung Fun/Rice noodle."}
