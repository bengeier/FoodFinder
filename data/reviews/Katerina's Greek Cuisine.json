{"text":"Not a good example of greek food in Mississauga. I got a takeout souvlaki dinner and the portion was very small for the size. The salad had no dressing and they didn't include the extra tzatziki sauce that I had paid for. I mentioned to include plastic cutlery in the packaging but it was not there (I was moving that day and we did not have any cutlery unboxed so it was very important to get plastic forks & knives). I ended up having to drive back to the restaurant to pick up the missing items."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, me thinks never ever again... We were hungry and thought we would try this venue so popped in for a quick lunch recently and it was pathetic.  Not authentic Greek food at all, it lacked any flavour whatsoever.  The quality of the lamb was just terrible, chewy and fatty.  $50 for lunch specials for 2 was sheer thievery for what they offer.  They are under staffed as well so we had to sit and wait.  Our wait staff was polite but so full of excuses for the worse then mediorce food they serve.  We had to hear a long explanation about the cuts they buy, this is after she saw all our lamb pieces chewed and spat out on our plate... Unbelivable !!! One of my worst experiences in the Clarkson neighborhood.  They clientelle seems to mostly be senior citizens and this food is bland and tasteless so go figure. Trying to write this review on other websites as well.  Buyer Beware.. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"So I visited this place on Saturday for the first time.  We were with a large group.  This place is very nice inside they did a great job with the d√©cor.  The services was great and the prices are decent.  When it comes to the food I was expecting a lot more as I usually do when going to a small Greek Restaurant.  I ordered the lamb chop.  The portion of lamb was good but they were stingy on the sides.  It also seemed that everything lacked taste.  I will probably visit there again but I would not go out of my way to do so"}
{"text":"I tried Chicken Souvlaki and was very delicious. Definitely recommend if you are lookin for some Greek food."}
