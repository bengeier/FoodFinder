{"text":"If you're looking for short-order, simple meals then this is your go-to place if you're in the neighborhood. Perfetto is located inside the NAU-North Valley Campus building, but is also open to the public at large. They use high quality coffee beans ground at the location in order to create coffee and coffee-based drinks like lattes. Soda fountain soft drinks, soup, sandwiches, salads, breakfast burritos, egg scrambles, muffins, and bagels are the usual fare. 

Call ahead to make sure they're open, as their hours often coincide with the university's administrative calendar. 

With advanced notice, Perfetto also does catering."}
{"text":"They do what they do very very well. Limited hours, so be sure to confirm they are open. The coffee is much better than I would have expected, and they are always ready with a fresh suggestion when I am looking for a meal. Customer service is personal and positive, every time I'm there."}
{"text":"This place is so simple, but I love it! There's a huge list of lattes, like the \"Marilyn Monrocha\" with white chocolate and cherry. Delicious. They are not as strong as a lot of other places, but I just can't help loving it for being so addictive.

There's also an assortment of sandwiches, with a couple hot snacks like quesadillas made-to-order. Normally, I'd give a place like this three stars, but at the risk of sounding cliche, every drink here is made with love. Every barista is charming and upbeat, not pretentious. They also sell their blends by the pound, which smell and taste robust without the bitter, burnt taste you'd get at a place like Starbucks.

3.5 stars rounded to 4 for being so gosh darn nice."}
