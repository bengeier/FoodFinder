{"text":"I am in town visiting family, so 6 of us stopped by for dinner. The ambiance was nice, but it seemed at though they needed more servers. They were very busy, and the service was very slow. I enjoyed my filet mignon, but the bread the served was wrapped in plastic, which took away from our experience.   I would give it another try because I have heard it is very good for breakfast from family members."}
{"text":"So charming so yummy! I will keep coming back to this place for years to come. Classic!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here in this charming little Seafood restaurant. The place exudes charm and  is very cleverly decorated in maritime decor. A friend mentioned they have fantastic fish and chips but I wanted to go for their Seafood platter (shrimp, langoustine, mussels, lobster, scallops served with rice and vegetables).  I enjoyed this with a Caesar salad that was nice and light to start! To the seafood platter it was amazing! You have a fantastic view of the Bay de Chaleur right in front of the restaurant! Just picturesque, even in the early spring! How quaint and appropriate. We talked with the owner Alain who was originally from Nice France.   Be aware they don't speak very good English here and the menu is francais only. However what you will receive is a fantastic local dinner!   Definitely a must hit up place!!"}
