{"text":"Erie Waters is closed for remodeling. Not sure when it's opening back up. But that's cool, they could use some sprucing up.  This place isn't bad. It's your typical bar and grill. Food is adequate and what you'd expect. Much better than Crapplebee's or any comparable chain.  I have a confession to make to Erie Waters. I once walked out with a half full pitcher of beer and my cousin walked out with a glass. We were still really beersty and couldn't fathom leaving a half empty pitcher to sit on a table all alone. So.... we swiped it and finished it in the parking lot. I'll bring it back next time, k?"}

{"text":"I'll agree with my fellow Yelpers that Erie Waters gets a 3 star rating.  I've visited this place about 6 times over the last year and each time had its share of creepiness to it.  Apparently going to this place on random weekdays around 5pm alone is not very popular cause I was the only person in there each time besides one guy that was trying to bum beers off of me, he kept telling me about some checks he has to cash but can't because his son has the rights to his bank account and the son was in jail.....whatever.  The two things that I did enjoy was the beer prices and the jukebox.  The bartender was cute in a white trash kind of way but she gave me a couple bucks to play music and all she asked was that I play Poison......I could have called that one from the stands.  Anyway, I'll go back again as soon as I get word they are opened back up.  Hopefully I'll find someone else to go there with otherwise I might have to put on my mullet wig and Whitesnake t-shirt just so nobody thinks I'm made of money and someone that might buy some dumb ass story like Vietnam Vinny tried telling me."}
{"text":"This is a nice family friendly beer joint. Fish fry is big here. The seating and mood are very comfortable. No fashionistas or fake tan sporting frat boys in sight. There's decent quesadillas, wings, and other appetizers to choose from. The beer selection is limited, but the tap always pours a fresh tasting brew. The staff are all very friendly and attentive. It's located a block south of Lakeshore blvd in the, heh, \"beautiful\" city of Euclid."}
