{"text":"The service is quick, the food is fresh, and the prices are actually reasonable. I recommend the West Coast Dragon Roll. It's not on the official menu, but it's tempura shrimp, crab stick, cream cheese, avocado, and cucumber. I also recommend topping it with their teriyaki sauce. It cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"It's just ok. Only 3 stools for seating. Concept is better than the execution. Flavors are not great. Rolls were chewy. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great place for inexpensive maki rolls. I really like that you can pick what you want to go into your roll and you can pick brown rice or white rice. The rolls are also really big. The staff is always friendly when I am ordering and the one guy always recognizes me and talks to me."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely brilliant.  As mentioned, if you are going for \"authenticity\", go elsewhere. If you want real authenticity, stop looking in an American city. This restaurant is another great take on the make-as-you-like meals. If you want a small maki, again, this is not the place for  you. However, for a roll that functions as a small sandwich, this is wonderful!  I very much recommend, and I only wish they had vegetable tempura!"}
{"text":"Craig street is full of variety and a host of wonderful restaurants. This sushi joint just opened up and I always give new places a go. First the place is way to small and feels very cramped. All that aside lets talk about the sushi, it is sorry to say guys way below average. There was just something way too fishy and spoiled about the rolls I had. All in all skip this place you can find better sushi at giant eagle market district and cheaper."}
{"text":"Confusing concept and the sushi could taste much better.    Sushi Fuku is a new restaurant that just opened up in Oakland.   It's assembly line-style sushi (a la Chipotle).    I think most people will simply pick their FEATURE rolls or bowls (about $7 each), where the combinations of protein, vegetables, and sauces have already been decided for you.  I've had the pittsburgh roll and the california roll and they were both mediocre.  The vegetables and protein are not fresh, and they DRENCH the sushi in sauce.   SESAME SEEDS are lacking in the rolls, so that nutty and added flavor is missing.    You can customize your sushi too.  While their concept is advertised as being as easy as 1-2-3, it's just CONFUSING.  I'm not sure people are comfortable customizing sushi like a burrito.      In summary, I think they need to drop the customized sushi concept and improve the quality of their sushi."}
{"text":"Today I had a chicken teriyaki bowl and it had the worst chicken in it- that I have ever had. The food was cold. Low grade gristley meat- made this disgusting."}
{"text":"Different, I wasn't sure what to do but the staff walked me thru it without any problem. Very nice people. Small place so seating is limited but there is take out. The rolls were huge.  I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is the model for industrial custom sushi. If that's appealing to you, then this is the place to eat.  Imagine Subway, but where all the ingredients are fresh, everything looks good, the service is quick and delightful, and with nice music and beautiful, clean seating.  I had two rolls for $13, and felt full.  Really a great find, right near Pitt."}
{"text":"I want to like this place sooo much but the food just isn't fresh. I usually end up with an upset stomach afterwards, even if all I order is rice and veggies. Bummer."}
{"text":"(This review based on eating here a few months ago, so insights might not be fresh.)  I stopped in for a quick lunch with some friends and out-of-town guests. We weren't expecting much, but what we got under-performed our expectations.  In a nutshell: the [white] rice was terrible. Gluey, badly cooked, nearly inedible.  The topping options involve many fried foods, which I actually find kind of novel. And some of the combinations could be quite interesting, if the rice wasn't always there stealing away any enjoyment I might have derived."}
{"text":"While not the best sushi in the world it's a fantastic deal. They have so many different options. It's a lot of fun to make new and interesting rolls or to eat the delicious ones already on their menu. This is for sushi what chipotle is for texmex. I would absolutely return and bring friends. I only wish there were a place to sit and eat there."}
{"text":"A cool concept for bowls and sushi- portions are somewhat small for the price but quality tasting food"}
{"text":"This place is like the sushi version of Chipotle. You can make your own sushi roll, sushi bowl, or salad; or you can choose one of theirs. I've also stopped in to ask about mochi ice cream a couple times, but it seems that they're just not selling it anymore, which is a shame.  I've had their chicken teriyaki bowl and made my own salad. I wish they'd add more toppings, though; with the bowls, there seems to be too much rice (or lettuce) for the amount of toppings. The rice in the bowls is their sushi rice, so it has a hint of flavor, which I enjoy. Overall, it's decent food, and I like the style of the shop. The interior is bright and clean; it's a comfortable place to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place. I can't say how authentic tasting the sushi is, as I am not a sushi connoisseur. However, it is delicious!  They have a load of options, even for vegetarians like me. There are some pretty nifty gadgets they use like a machine that prints rice (white or brown) onto your seaweed (or soy wrap), and an automated cutter. The price is very good, especially considering how large their rolls are ($5 for a huge vegetarian roll). They have a separate cutter for veggie only rolls (not a big deal to me, but may be important for some vegetarians). Their sauces are delicious (I've only tried sweet chili and spicy mayo). And the toppings are good as well, especially the crunchy onions. The presentation is extremely nice, and the atmosphere is very clean and modern.   My wife and I loved it so much we went back the next day. Also, the staff is very friendly and will give you suggestions on what to get if asked.  Overall, after not having any good sushi for the last year or more, this place has me craving it once again. I will definitely be back, and soon!"}
{"text":"The rolls are really huge and the price is really good too. Whenever I want to grab sushi I don't mind taking a bus and go to Sushi Fuku, I've evangelized my friends too :)"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for restaurant week. Sushi was really mediocre. I will say that the rolls ARE huge, as many people on here have said, so if you're just looking to fill your belly for not too much money, this is probably a good place. But my sushi smelled fishy and was really flavorless. I had a spicy tuna roll and the other thing I didn't like about it was how much spicy sauce was on it. Someone on yelp used the word \"drenched\", and that is also how I would describe it. I won't be back.   On the upside, it is very clean inside and it appears they have wifi - lots of people using computers."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! Fresh, tasty, fun! My son recommended we get lunch to go from here. I thought, sushi to go, yuck. But I was wrong! We ordered 2 bowls and 2 rolls. We sat at a park table enjoying every bite and he had enough left over for dinner! The young lady running the register today... Wonderful and patient! My only complaint was I felt a bit rushed not ever being there before and not how to order but that was mostly because of the pressure of the line behind me... Next time I'll see if I can find a menu online ahead of time :)"}
{"text":"It has a really cool concept that I've never seen done with sushi.  The sushi tasted amazing and the place was decorating very modern and nice.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The sushi is not bad but half the time I get something here, there are either hair or wood splinter-esque things in the rice. Horrible. I hope their hygiene standards get improved soon."}
{"text":"Large portions, really fresh and great prices! I went a little before the lunch rush, was able to get a seat and enjoy. Got a Philly Roll and a side salad!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Love the concept. You can either select one of their signature rolls or create your own, by selecting from the fresh ingredients right in front of you! Excellent customer service and great prices.  Being from Hawaii, I'm always craving good sushi, and this definitely satisfies my craving!"}
{"text":"Sushi Fuku is excellent quality, make your own, quick sushi. This is not a fancy sit down sushi restaurant. Sushi Fuku is fast and always delicious. The staff are very friendly and quick to help guide you through your sushi experience. The restaurant is very clean, and also has a rewards program. For every sushi roll you buy, you get one point. Ten points amounts to a free sushi roll. Overall, some of the best sushi I have ever had, and you can not beat the price."}
{"text":"Good place to get some fast but pretty healthy food! Do not expect those exquisite Sushi that you get from Sushi bars, but you can get some fresh, healthy and yummy Sushi rolls/bowls/burritos from here very quickly with reasonable prices! You can how they make the food, so that you know that what you got is fresh and clean for sure. Since you can customize your own Sushi, you can make it a very healthy meal with so many options of proteins and veggies. Perfect place for me to get food during busy school days~"}
{"text":"How this place provides food is like Chipotle  in sushi version. You have 3 options: roll, bowl or salad. Forget about any sushi you have ever tried. Here, you can use your imagination to create your own sushi, just mix and match meat and vegetable you like. But the food may turn out weirded or amazing..who knows. Or if you don't want to take a risk, they have a typical sushi menu to serve you. No worry. :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year to eat lunch with friends, and there sushi rolls are delicious every time. What's great is that each roll is quite large when compared to other sushi places, so it's quite filling for a good price! The tables are also always very clean, and staff very friendly. I'll be sad when I move from Pittsburgh, because I don't think I'll be able to find a sushi joint which can even compare."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first night at Sushi Fuku on Craig. I've heard great things about it from my co-workers. I came 15 minutes before closing (my friends said it was really quick service). Barely received a greeting from the gentleman behind the counter. I'm new to sushi in general and told him I'd never been there before, expecting him to offer up some helpful guidance. He said \"its build your own sushi.\" Really?! I thought it was a barbecue. We proceeded down the line and it was like pulling teeth to get help/guidance so seeing how annoyed he was I made a quick selection and asked for two of the same rolls. He made one and walked away. I didn't even have the energy to ask about the second. The young woman at the counter was less helpful. She asked me about sauce (I think) I could barely hear her. Again, I didn't have the energy to ask what my choices were so I said soy and she pointed me to a side self-serve counter. Paid and was out of there. I'm not sure if the sushi was great. It was tasty enough. The service however was extremely poor. I got the sense that they were either annoyed that I came in at 15 minutes to close or that I was a novice sushi eater or both. It's a great concept, tasty sushi, and fast and convenient. Just missing some friendly faces and better attitudes to newcomers to sushi."}
{"text":"The Chipotle of sushi spots. And I'll be damned if their yum yum sauce isn't flawlessly named. I like to get a bowl with eel or white tuna, avocado, carrots, sprouts, yum yum sauce and sesame seeds. And their rice is excellent! What a meal."}
{"text":"I mean it's subway for sushi, what's better than that! I really enjoyed their rolls and bowls. I also like that they have the option for brown rice too, and they have a good array of vegetables to choose from.   They go heavy on the sauce, so be careful when ordering some. You could always get it on the side as well.   Good concept and good food, and they're opening one closer to CMU's campus too! It's also great for vegans/vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Assembly line made sushi, geared towards 'customization'. The rice is poor (not remotely seasoned) and laid too thick by their rice spreading machines. The freshness of the ingredients was acceptable, but not impressive. The roll was quite overpriced for what I got. I guess this place is alright if you want heavily Americanized sushi fast, but with Sushi Boat and Oishii Bento right on the same block, I don't know what anyone is doing eating here."}
{"text":"This place is like the Subway/Chipotle of sushi... which is fun, yet terrifying. I love the fact that you can customize whats in the roll, especially if you have an allergy or something.. HOWEVER, buying sushi from a place that feels like they need a sneeze guard always makes me nervous (think questionable buffet sushi). Luckily, I like to live my life dangerously.. so I'm all about trying potentially questionable sushi. I was surprised how fresh the ingredients tasted, it was clear that everything that was set out was fresh.  Moving on! I like their shirts. (Fan-fuku-tastic or fuku all night long), oh jeez, I was cracking up... obviously not out loud, because then people would think I was a bit off, so I laughed aloud in my thoughts. ANYWAY! Pros: lots of choices, you can customize your roll, funny shirts, friendly staff, decent quality Cons: nowhere to sit, the fact that there is an assembly line of uncooked fish, the fact that their handling raw fish while wearing shirts with sexual tones (hehehehehe) I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I visit as often as I can when I'm in town. It's fast, easy, and delicious! The only complaint I may have is that the fish isn't as fresh as it could be (but that's expected with the format, I suppose)."}
{"text":"The absolute best fast sushi in Pittsburgh, perfect location right in the heart of the University of Pittsburgh in Oakland. Sushi Fuku has stellar employees, quality ingredients and a modern fresh atmosphere. The friendly man at the counter (manager I assume since he's always there) greets you upon entering and engages in witty conversation during your quick trip through the line. An absolute endless smile is contagious and his energy is refreshing. Must try the Oakland Avenue Roll or Dragon Roll! The best spot for a post-workout meal as well. This is one of my absolute favorite spots in all of Pittsburgh for so many reasons."}
{"text":"If you like eating your sushi in a form of a churro, Sushi Fuku has got you covered.   Their build your own sushi concept took me by surprise and is pretty refreshing in terms of sushi options. What's even better was their sushi is pretty reasonably priced. Decor is really neat and fresh.   Overall, it's a nice place to get a little snack if you're ever hungry but not a meal if you're a big eater like me."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Is the name supposed to draw a double take and have people notice the restaurant? Either way it worked. Good environment. Lots of bright let being let in. Tables are really small though and close to one another.  Chipotle-style customization is appealing to those who can create good roll combinations. But unlike Chipotle and similar concepts, I found it a lot more difficult to build a cohesive roll.   My friend made his own sushi - bacon, assortment of veggies.... it didn't turn out very well and fell apart easily.   I got the Korean roll thinking it might have similar flavors to a korean taco I enjoy elsewhere, but the steak was flavorless, and so dry it was impossible to chew and painful to swallow. The kimchi had no flavor and did not save the otherwise bland mayo and beef combination. Bad decision. But this seems to reflect on the quality of their ingredients that are used in their food, and in the build your own as well.  On the upside, portions are huge (like 10 pieces per roll) and are a steal for the price, and this is a notch above any campus sushi I've ever had, so there's that at least."}
{"text":"I love this place! This is such a great concept. I love the fact that you can customize your sushi and the FUKU chips are a must have. I think I've found my new addiction. It doesn't matter whether this place is authentic Japanese sushi or not. The fact is this place is clean, fresh and produces good quality food for your money. I've been in multiple times and I have yet to be disappointed. Plus, it's kind of fun designing/customizing a different kind of sushi each time I go in."}
{"text":"As everyone else has said, this concept is amazing. Yes the proportions of rice to other ingredients is completely off, but what you get is pretty good tasting product that is health and really affordable. This kind of place is going to be in every college town and every food court in the next 10 years. I guarantee it.   I ordered a salmon roll with avocado, cucumber, and jalapeno, so obviously I wasn't looking for anything amazing authentic. The taste is pretty good, better than those to go containers you see everywhere now. The only problem is the pieces are so huge you can't eat them like regular sushi unless you have a huge mouth."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here! The rolls are always yummy and the people remember us and our orders every time. It's super friendly and it's a go-to option for us when we want dinner quick."}
{"text":"I have to say that I love this place for a quick lunch.  If you are a sushi snob or connoisseur, do not go here.  It is not the best sushi in the city or even the block, but it perfect for what it is...a place to get a cheap, fast lunch.  The build your own sushi is best option in which you pick your protein and then three vegetables and a sauce."}
{"text":"I discovered that I didn't like sushi awhile ago, but the great thing about this place is that you don't have to eat here (even though it's in the name)! A friend convinced me to come here, and I played it safe with a chicken bowl which was absolutely delicious. Then, I became bolder and tried a roll with cream cheese, avocado and shrimp and my meal was made! Coupled with soy sauce and spicy sushi sauce, I found something that I could go back to time and time again. So don't let the fact that you dislike sushi keep you from experiencing this place, because there are plenty of options for sushi lovers and non-sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"These sushi rolls are huge.  I ordered two rolls and some tempura shrimp and shumai and had enough food for 3 people.  The rolls are huge.  Everything was made quickly and the result was really delicious. This place is clean, the employees were actively cleaning, sorting and organizing everything.  Very good, I would only suggest to the Fuku menu makers to maybe include some jalapeno's in the roll options."}
{"text":"Great food great vibes. I will be back at this location with my good friend Kim. I must also bring my fiancée as well. She'll love it!"}
{"text":"Upon visiting the place a third time, it soon became clear that the decent quality fish I got the last two times was not representative of their consistent quality. This time I got a bowl of rubbery, sinewy/stringy tuna that's among the worst I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"At Sushi Fuku, the power is in your hands: you get to decide between bowl or rolls, you get to pick your protein, you get to decide on which vegetables and sauces as well. It's like Subway, but for sushi.   It's a quick and convenient lunch/dinner after a long day of classes or work. This interactive sushi making place is such a clever idea. I definitely recommend this if you are in the Oakland area."}
{"text":"Love this place. I eat here on my lunch break at least once a week. You can customized your own bowl. The staff is really friendly too"}
{"text":"This is like the subway of sushi... Not the freshest, but not the worst... Been there twice and I was happy both times!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd Sushi Fuku location in Oakland (their main one is on Oakland Ave.) and it's won me over pretty quickly as a decent place to grab sushi on the go. Their menu and meal options are basically the same as the main one. And like their parent location, you can either order from a small selection of sushi rolls such as spicy tuna or Philly rolls, or you can custom make your own sushi or sushi bowls.   Though not the greatest sushi in the city it's a decent option considering their prices. About $9 got me a drink and 10 rolls - deals like that are great for folks like me, who have to satisfy sushi cravings on a regular basis. And they certainly don't have terrible fish or awful ingredients overall, so while not somewhere I'd go for high quality sushi I think it's good for what it is. They also won me over pretty quickly because they make some of the best Philly rolls I can find. (Seriously, other sushi places need to look at the proportions of the roll and take notes, particularly regarding the amount of cream cheese. Less cream cheese is more, especially when the norm I've dealt with is getting half a roll of it!)   Unfortunately, while the food itself is worthy of 4 stars on my cheap eats scale, this place is entirely too tiny. It's clearly meant to be a walk-in establishment for people who are on the go, and unlike its main location there are maybe two stools you can sit on in total. But there's also no room for a line to form, as there's just enough room to walk straight from the door to the ordering station. And there's not a ton of room for the employees, either. So as great as the on-the-go plan was, I think it's too small to keep up with a real meal rush. And while it's served me well in Oakland's \"off\" season, I doubt I'll stop in too often when Pitt and CMU classes resume in the fall - I'm expecting the place to be jam packed at that point!"}
{"text":"Almost a year after my first visit to Sushi Fuku I decided to give the place another shot. And I have to say, this time around the food I got was much better! I'd give them a 3.5 if I could since the meal wasn't quite \"Yay I'm a fan\" worthy, but they're still a step or two above just being \"a-ok.\"  My biggest complaint last time was the mix of rice vs. protein and vegetables in my sushi - specifically that my sushi was almost entirely rice, which isn't what I want in my sushi rolls. If I want rice, I'll order rice, and I certainly won't pay $7 - $10 for it! Fortunately my last visit earlier this week was much better than that first visit - I enjoyed an order of their Rainbow Rolls that was not 70% rice, and in fact featured exactly the right balance of rice vs. other ingredients.   The result was that while my sushi wasn't the freshest or greatest on the planet, it was certainly much more enjoyable than round one had been. I actually sat and savored that meal in Sushi Fuku, since they weren't super busy while I was there. I left feeling content and satisfied, and finally understanding why people get the appeal of coming in and ordering customizable sushi rolls. (Of course the catch with creating your own is that the ingredients won't necessarily mix and stick together well - one benefit of a standard menu is that it's been tested for things like that.) I still don't think they're necessarily the best or even cheapest sushi in the area - just depending on exactly what you order - but at least now I know that if I stop in and order sushi again I won't just be paying for a whole lot of rice with a dash of fish and vegetables. I'll definitely consider stopping in in the future."}
{"text":"FUKU!  My friend and I were headed to our old trusty Sushi Boat in Oakland and realized that Sushi Fuku had opened.  We decided to go there instead and let's just say it's added to our list of places to eat lunch at once a week.  It's clean, it's new, the stuff is fresh...you can create your own sushi, you can create your own rice bowls.  My friend likened it to creating a burrito bowl at Chipotle.  What I'm most impressed with are the machines that lay the rice on the seaweed wrapper and the one that cuts the sushi into 10 perfect pieces.  It loses a little authenticity because it's not done by hand BUT, it's still awesome to watch.  Definitely worth a try if you're in search of sushi in Oakland.  I think it will win over the other 2 sushi places that are within steps of each other on Oakland Ave. (Sushi Boat and Oishi Bento)."}
{"text":"I like this concept of a fast-food Chipotle-like eating experience for sushi. I went for the veggie sushi roll and a side of seaweed salad. It cost around $9 for both. I think the sushi would have been under $7 on its own. I enjoyed the roll but the seaweed was just ok. This place seems to get busy at lunch time so plan accordingly. I went in at 1:30pm - post lunch hour rush, and enjoyed a quieter ambiance. The manager is really friendly and seemed to go out of his way to greet, thank, and chat with customers. That was nice to see. Also, i liked that this place is clean, from the eating area to the restroom. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had!! Fast and easy. Very clean and modern looking. TVs for the menu. So many options to choose from ! Exactly like subway but with sushi! Will be getting my sushi from here from now on!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Wide variety of options, the place is super neat and cozy. Best of all is their service, they'll always have a smile for you. What are you waiting to go?"}
{"text":"Loved it! The inside was clean and modern looking. The menu has lots of options, so there's something for everyone. I love sushi and so does my sister who came with me and this did not disappoint.   We ordered the fire bowl and the the twin city roll. The sushi rolls are big, so one roll is probably enough for one person. Our food was delicious and fresh. You definitely will leave full and happy here. The rice bowl I ordered had a good amount of spice due to the kimchi and jalepeños, so it's not for those who can't handle spice. However, there's plenty of stuff here that doesn't have spice.  All in all, I definitely recommend coming here. It was an amazing lunch."}
{"text":"Super healthy, relatively cheap and incredibly delicious. Sushi Fuku is like the Chipotle of sushi, with their simple yet personalized options (of sushi, a bowl or sushi \"burrito\"). It is completely awesome and incredibly satisfying. Inari topping is a must try!"}
{"text":"Making the sushi rolls (or bowls) right in front of you makes your sushi that much better! With all incredibly fresh ingredients & a wide array of ingredients & sauces this is a place you have to stop at if you're in Oakland!"}
{"text":"I won't repeat what others already wrote about this being a fast food concept for sushi. Definitely far from good sushi, but certainly an interesting, streamlined concept. First time I have seen the machines, but definitely not something I would seek out. This is one of the first times my boys did not scarf down the rolls. You can enhance the flavor with a variety of sauces..they were a bit bland due to the rolls having so much rice.  Either way, nice concept for college kids who are on the run all the time."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Fuku because it is fast, fresh, healthy, and the size of the rolls make substantial meal at a great price. For vegetarians/vegans, there are lots of yummy fillings to choose from, but the featured veggie roll is a great value at 5.95. The miso soup is very tasty and cheap too, and I am told is vegan. I wish they would add a veg protein option, like tofu, but that's pretty much my only complaint."}
{"text":"I like their sushi burrito it's up it's pretty expensive if you keep adding the extra fish an extra meat in there. But I like their bowls as well if you add chicken"}
{"text":"Another surprise for us. My son could eat any type of Asian food morning, noon and night. We've taken him here several times for take out and we went elsewhere. But, on Sunday, we all went and ate inside. The people that work there are very nice and helpful. The menu is almost like a subway-style; you tell them what you want from an easy to follow menu, and they make it. We all had sushi (although they do have some cooked dishes). All very good. Fresh and certainly a good size portion. They have several sauces to choose from and that's always fun. No leftovers. It was quick too. I think with us pondering the menu and eating, we were done in about 45 minutes.  VERY nice that they recognize there are other people in Oakland besides the students as they were actually open where we noticed other locations on that street were closed."}
{"text":"Make your own sushi basically. The bowls are a bad deal compared to the sushi and the sushi burrito is basically uncut sushi and not worth getting. The sushi is decent with a variety of ingredients to choose from that are all pretty good quality. Atmosphere is nice and service is fast making it close to fast food"}
{"text":"Sushi Fuku is heaven for someone who loves sushi but gets a little picky with their sushi choices. They have options between sushi rolls, \"burritos\", and bowls. A typical order consists of 1 protein, 4 veggies/misc, and 2 toppings/sauces. They also have the option for soy wraps and brown rice, which is great if I'm feeling the need to be healthy.   My issue with this place is that it's insanely tiny and has like 2 seats, inevitability making it a takeout place. It's even awkward to stand in line sometimes. If you're for nicer ambience - go to their first location in Oakland (quality between the two is pretty identical).  Make sure when you visit to download FiveStars and join their rewards program. Occasionally they send out coupons like \"free extra protein\" and 12 points gets you a free sushi roll/burrito/bowl!"}
{"text":"Their sushis taste great and they serve in sufficient quantity so that you're satisfied with your meal afterwards. Not sure if it's authentic sushi. But what they serve tastes great. We ordered philly rolls and fire bowl. Pretty good food!"}
{"text":"Great sushi huge portions friendly talkative staff got a huge 10 piece spicy tuna avocado roll for only $7"}
{"text":"Our Office calls this place the Sushi Subway of Pittsburgh. We can't get enough of this place, the sushi rolls are the size of burritos, the ingredients are consistently fresh you can order it the way you like. The Salmon roll and shrimp tempura rolls are outstanding and the Miso soup is very good for a fast food restaurant. Finally, the staff are the friendliest group you'll meet. Its a tight squeeze inside but well worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, quick sushi. Can't go wrong. Has a great atmosphere and the service is always awesome! Highly recommend this place for some good sushi in Oakland."}
{"text":"So I have been here a total of 3 times in 7 days.  Sushi Fuku is legit.    I wish this business well and hope they can expand their operations into Downtown."}
{"text":"Pretty cool concept. Rolls are very reasonably priced. Agree with other reviewers, regarding subway layout, but it works well. I can't remember a sushi place that has build your own roll. You can also get a sushi burrito, bowl, etc.   For what this place is going for, I think it is very good. It's not gourmet sushi and that's not what you should expect. If you want better than average sushi, want it quick and want a fun, unique restaurant, then you shouldn't be disappointed. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Tiny little place with only few places to eat. Besides sushi, they offer sushi burritos and sushi bowls. Everything can be customized (e.g. Choice of white or brown rice), different sauces. The sushi was quite good, but they messed up the order by putting some weird sauce on mine (and were then upset when I asked them to make it again) and we never got the Gyoza we ordered."}
{"text":"simple, creative menu, good sushi, nice quick pitstop on your way to where you're going in oakland!"}
{"text":"When Sushi met Chipotle, they met in Heaven. Heaven is located in two places. One in Oakland and one in Craig St., between Pitt and CMU campuses.  Sushi Fuku is a fast-food style, but not in quality, Make-Your-Own Sushi Rolls, or Bowls, or Salads, or Burrito.  You pick the dwelling for your food, like Chipotle, then your protein, veggies, condiments, and watch the magical process happen, as the machine slices the roll into 10 LARGE pieces. The amount of food for your money is ridiculous. Literally, one roll could easily feed 2 people. Everything looked and tasted very fresh, and the possible combinations are endless.  Definitely a new favorite and worth the experience."}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend for lunch and I don't eat sushi... but this place is awesome! For those of us who don't like sushi or even seafood they have a great bowl option that allows you to pick your protein, veggies, and sauces.  I had the white rice with grilled chicken, carrots, sprouts and avocado with sweet chili sauce. SO GOOD! I added some sriracha for added kick toward the end. They also were participating in the Restaurant Week here in Oakland, so $6.00 for plenty of food for lunch was awesome!   The seating options are limited so groups would have a harder time during busy parts of the day... all 2-top seats and there is a window facing bar for single / additional seating.  My friend said she loves the salmon bowl with yum-yum sauce - so it seems like the seafood is good too!"}
{"text":"This is a quick service sushi concept and as such they're doing a great job. They are quick and affordable, the sides are great, there is plenty to choose from, and I love the chirashi bowls.  Sometimes it's 2 o'clock already, Ali Baba is closed and you know that Kohli's will be out of lunches. Or you don't want a sandwich or a bagel, you don't want to eat at a sit down place, and you definitely don't want to pay more than $10. Sushi Fuku rescues my picky self about once a week.  However, dear eater, if you come in expecting a Japanese restaurant you will be disappointed. They are quick, they are cheap, and they don't give a damn about how much soy sauce you're going to pour all over your fish."}
{"text":"With a name like Sushi Fuku, you know you have to stop in and see what it's all about!  We stopped in for dinner on a Friday night, and it wasn't too crowded. This was my first time here, and I was a bit overwhelmed by all of the choices... there are soooo many!! However, for people like me that have anxiety with too many options, they also have a predefined menu. I chose the volcano bowl, and it did not disappoint! All of the vegetables and greens were super fresh, and the rice was served piping hot. One note - the spicy mayo is VERY spicy... my mouth was on fire for a long time after leaving, but it was so good! If you're not a fan of spicy hot, definitely skip the mayo.  Next time I go, I would definitely try to make my own! You can choose to make a sushi roll, bowl, or sushi burrito. You get to choose the meat, vegetables, and the sauce on top, top!  This is a great little spot in Oakland, right on Pitt's campus. There is limited street parking out front, and it is pretty small inside, so I could see seating being in issue during busy times. However, it's definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I was a sushi bowl newbie before coming to Pittsburgh, but I am never going back! They have an incredible variety of foods to choose from. Everything is custom - think Chipotle, but for sushi. The place is clean, the staff is friendly, and it's honestly the best place to be for a sushi fanatic like myself.  This isn't exactly a con in my book, but prices are definitely mid-range for a smaller sized portion and the prices vary depending on what you get. I almost always get the kani crabstick for protein since it's the most affordable."}
{"text":"If you like sushi, this is your new home in Oakland. If you don't, you should probably stop by Sushi Fuku anyway. This place has everything you could want in a restaurant - tons of options, huge proportions, great prices, friendly staff and a banging rewards program. I have been going to Sushi Fuku since it opened and I have learned to really love the place. The environment is clean and welcoming and the people are so awesome. Whether you are a first time visitor or a seasoned resident of Oakland, you need to stop in.  When you are ordering, you will see that you can completely customize the sushi roll exactly as you want it. If you're not sure what goes well together, they give you a few signature roll ideas on their menu. (Tip: if you are torn between two different rolls, they will let you do half and half!) The place has a very modern feel, one machine lays the rice on the seaweed wrap and then a different machine cuts the roll into perfect pieces for you at the end. Did I mention the proportions too? I have never gotten this much sushi for the low prices that Fuku offers. The rolls are massive; I feel super satisfied having a roll for dinner.   When paying, you can sign up/use the rewards program that Sushi Fuku uses. This card is free to all customers. It is also extremely convenient because other places in Oakland use the same program; once you sign up at one of the locations, you are set for all the other rewards programs too! As you keep going back to Sushi Fuku, as I suspect you will, you will earn points towards free things like drinks, sushi rolls or t-shirts!!   Lastly, all the employees are super friendly. No matter what mood I am, I leave with a smile on my face. They truly make Sushi Fuku a fun place to eat. Make sure you stop in and make Sushi Fuku your next favorite restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I serve fast and reasonable price. Their sushi rice and roll use the machine to make. Quality of the food kind of acceptable. Hard to find parking due to down town.  Clean environment."}
{"text":"Rice with a twist! Love love the idea of combining flavors on my own! Fun place as an alternative to Oishi. Clean and convenient for Oakland people."}
{"text":"This is sushi fast food on Craig street.  Main appeal is the proximity to the universities and speed.  Good sushi and good for a quick lunch.  Not haute cuisine but not bad.  I like the fact that you can have a low-carb alternative with protein and vegetables on a salad. Prices are reasonable.  $8 for shrimp salad with ginger dressing.  The location is popular with students.  Not a lot of seating so consider taking order to go."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating lunch here! The california sushi roll was fresh and prepared right in front of me. I like how you can customize your sushi roll with different ingredients. They have salads and rice bowls that they will make you if you prefer something besides sushi. There prices are reasonable too! I got 10 of the california sushi rolls for around $7 with tax, which isn't a bad price at all for sushi. The seating feels a little cramped, but the benefit is you can get to know other people around you better! I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Fresh, cheap, fast and you can build your own sushi roll. One of my favorites! Friendly employees as well."}
{"text":"This became my favorite place for lunch for the few days I was in Pittsburgh for a gig. The concept is great, the sushi is (at least both times I went) consistently adequate (I mean, this isn't Masa, so don't expect a life-changing experience, just a solid one), the veggies are fresh, and the sauces are delicious (not all spicy mayos are created equal, and this one reigns supreme). On top of that, I enjoy their miso soup.   Would that every city had a place like this. The concept (being able to take any sushi roll and turn it into a chirashi bowl or a salad, depending on your mood, OR being able to create your own roll/bowl by choosing from an ample list of fresh ingredients) is what makes it stand out from other fast-food-sushi joints. Love it, hope it franchises further north."}
{"text":"Best quality service with great employees. Food tastes amazing and the employees were really friendly. My first time in Pittsburgh, PA and I was pleased that I found this place. It's like a Japanese chipotle. Make sure to try the Eye of the tiger sushi burrito!"}
{"text":"Fast food sushi take out. Assembly line process: they put your fillings on the nori+rice then run it through a rolling machine. I've been there twice. The food is just not fresh. I'm not sure how it could be: everything sits precut on a cold table. The salmon I had was awful; on a second visit I tried chicken, also not great. The shop in Oakland seems to get better reviews, and I might even try it at some point. I would not go to the Craig shop again. It's not sushi, much like McDonalds is not hamburger. That said, you get a really large portion for a good price, and I can appreciate that. But at some point it gets hard to have to eat the stuff."}
{"text":"My friend and I met up for lunch and this was both our first time trying Sushi Fuku. I think the concept is really unique and the location is really perfect with the hospital being so close. Definitely a place you can grab a quick lunch which is always nice for those busy days.   I was pleasantly surprised by how big the sushi rolls were since I'm used to getting tiny shrimp tempura rolls from Nakama; which I don't mind. I decided to get shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, white rice and soy sauce ($6.95). They do not skimp you on the veggies they are pretty large in size. The shrimp was extra crispy which was really nice. I thought the sushi was flavorful, but I struggled with the seaweed being on the outside of the roll. It was kinda tough to chew and I would have preferred it was on the inside, but overall I thought everything was great. You get 10 rolls and I thought the price wasn't bad for how much get get. My friend ordered the Philly roll and she really liked it! I probably wouldn't pick something like that only because it's made with raw salmon."}
{"text":"The Oakland location has become a routine stop for me, and honestly, I'm just as impressed by the consistent quality of the food as I am by the consistent amicable nature of the staff.   I don't want that latter point to be glazed over. This is a highly-populated college area and a demographic that can certainly be trying. I've rarely, if ever, encountered an employee that is anything but helpful.  Now onto the food: I typically make my own bowl, and I've never had an issue with the quality of the ingredients nor have I ever been disappointed.   The clearly labeled Gluten Free and Vegan options with associated caloric estimates are an especially nice touch for the health-conscious crowd.   Also a great place to bring your friends if you want sushi and they do not - chicken, tofu, and cooked items are available and also quite tasty.   Bonus points for the excellent presentation and fun branding.   Pro tips:  *This is the same ownership as Fuku Tea (also worth a visit) just down the street - they have gift cards that can be used at both establishments by the register  **If you're planning to place a takeout order through yelp, check their main site first to make sure that the items listed are correct sushifuku.com"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and the food was good for a \"fast food.\" Definitely lots of options so you won't tire of the food."}
{"text":"We finally got to try this out and though I hadn't thought about the fact that a sushi burrito isn't much more than a tightly wrapped hand roll, Sushi Fuku is still special. It's a counter sushi place with amazingly fast service where you get to pick your rice (white or brown), your type of wrap or bowl (burrito, cut roll, bowl), your protein (raw & cooked options and you can get more than one for a small extra fee), your extras inside, and then your toppings (if you get a bowl or cut roll). All the ingredients were super fresh. Service was fast and friendly. The prices are good - especially considering how much more seemed to be in this roll than an average roll. One roll each (with 2 proteins) and we were full. I can't wait to go back and wish there were one in Robinson, so I could go for lunch at work and more often for dinner.  If you haven't been to Sushi Fuku yet and want great, fresh, fast-food sushi, I can't recommend it more. Go now and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was convinced to try this place by friends several months after it opened. I was used to frequenting some of the other sushi places on the street, and finally decided to give this place a try.   I just don't see the big deal about being able to choose what goes into your sushi rolls. Maybe I just enjoy the craft and expertise provided by having an actual experienced sushi chef make my sushi. Or maybe I'm not all that enchanted by the idea of having sushi made by a machine.   It's an okay place, but for me and for others like, it might not be the ideal place for sushi, especially when there are other establishments on the same street."}
{"text":"Have to change my review after eating at a couple of sushi places. Honestly, I should have waited until I tried other sushi places.  The design of Sushi Fuku is still great. Minimalist and clean, in stark contrast to it's next-door neighbour, Sushi Boat. It feels like a much nicer restaurant than it is.   Which beings me to the food. It's not bad, but it really is the \"fast food\" of sushi in Oakland. You'll get your sushi in around 2 minutes. The rolls are huge too. To the point wear some people may have trouble fitting each cut into their mouth. The quality is okay, but Sushi Boat is better (and Little Tokyo in the Southside is better still).   TL;DR nice design, big serving sizes, mediocre sushi."}
{"text":"We had a great brunch here.  Awesome burrito with tuna, salmon, avocado and masago in a seaweed roll with ponzu.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We came here on opening day with a promise for a free entree (bowl or roll), and we definitely weren't disappointed (I mean, how could you be when you walk into a restaurant with a wall full of Sriracha?)  I described this place as being like a Sushi \"Subway\" or \"Chipotle.\"  You pick the style (salad, bowl or roll), protein (anything from raw tuna and salmon, to chicken teriyaki), and all of your added extras (asparagus, cucumber, avocado, the list goes on and on!).  Being a huge sauce fan, one of the best things is the assortment of dressings for your creation, which includes wasabi mayo and spicy chilli.  The place is small, like many in Oakland, however the decor is modern and clean.  The service is super fast (they have manual sushi cutters, and conveyors of pre-made seaweed and sushi rice bases for the rolls!) Overall, an excellent and creative concept, and a great Oakland stop for a quick and fresh lunch."}
{"text":"This is how America does sushi!  I was skeptical about this place at first... having just watched \"Jiro, Dreams of Sushi\" I expect an extensive variety of extremely high quality ingredients out of my sushi experience. While that isn't exactly what you'll find here, I was pleasantly surprised. The selection is limited compared to most sushi places but the quality of what they offer is very good. The price is incredible for the amount of food you get-- comparable to chipotle.  Don't come here expecting gourmet sushi but do expect delicious, reasonably-priced, americanized sushi. The rolls are huge-- if two rolls typically fill you up, one here will do the trick."}
{"text":"This shop feels very much like a Chipotle for sushi to me. Food is made when you order and served pretty fast, which is good for getting togo food. Quality of food is decent here, although not particularly great. I personally don't usually order the selections with raw foods here just because they don't seem particularly fresh compared to other sushi I've had before. Most recently, I got the Golden Dragon Roll which had shrimp tempura and salmon. It was decent and tasted pretty good, and I always enjoy sushi. Overall, I would probably come back if I wanted a quick bite and was in the area."}
{"text":"Sushi Fuku is not for everyone, especially if you're looking for authentic Japanese-style sushi, but I always enjoy what I get here. They have a very unique \"Americanized\" selection of sushi that includes things like fried chicken or steak, which sound really weird at first, but are surprisingly delicious as sushi. You can choose between a soy wrap/seaweed wrap and white/brown rice. You also have the option to make your own sushi.  At first it may seem a little pricey, but you get a roll (10 LARGE pieces) of sushi and it's pretty worth the price. Everything is always made very quickly and the staff are patient and friendly. My favorite is the Korean sushi with steak and kimchi.   They have drinks, side dishes (like miso soup and kimchi) and mochi ice cream. Although I haven't tried the sides, and I'm not sure how many mochi you get, $1.50 for mochi ice cream isn't too bad--especially you can't really find it anywhere else in Oakland. Their drinks are a bit overpriced, but again, you can't really find ramune (Japanese soda) and brands of Japanese green tea unless you go to Asian markets in the Strip."}
{"text":"I think I might have just found my favorite restaurant in Oakland. We went during the Oakland restaurant week for lunch here and each got shrimp tempura in a sushi roll for $6. And it tasted great even though there were just three or four main ingredients in there. The line also moved pretty fast. The only downside is that it was so good that I pretty much went into a food coma during my anatomy class afterwards..."}
{"text":"This is a great idea with a great location. Staff was friendly just not very interested in sharing information or recommending choices for a first time customer. I was disappointed looking around at others awesome combinations and compared to my platter of sashimi I enjoyed with a nagging that it could have been much better with a bit more guidance. I see great possibilities and opportunity in this kind of service. I would also like to comment on how the fish sits open to air with the cooks standing over it and reaching over it not the most safe way to keep the food from pathogens. Its not a bad place it was clean and the service was very nice. However two doors down is the Sushi Boat and they still have my heart for great prices and sushi."}
{"text":"I visited for lunch today at around noon with a friend.  Since it'd been awhile since I'd last had sushi, and I'd had Sushi Fuku bookmarked for eons, I was excited to try a new lunch spot in Oakland.  Based on Larissa G.'s review and the photos, I decided to order the rainbow roll with wasabi mayo as a dressing.  All of the options on the serving line looked good, and it was fun to watch the employees assembling the rolls by hand, with interesting tools and machines for assistance.  The final product resembled the photos I'd seen quite well, with a beautiful assortment of colors.  Flavorwise, I found the rolls on the bland side, but the wasabi mayo and dressings (wasabi sauce, ginger, soy sauce) helped to dress them up--and then again, this is seafood we're talking about.  The price ($10.33 w/o tax) seemed on the high side for the amount and quality of sushi received (10 rolls), esp. in comparison to other comparable sushi joints in PGH (e.g., another sushi place downtown is charging the same for twice as much food).  Appropriate for a fast casual joint, service was efficient and friendly, and the atmosphere was clean and minimalist.  In terms of the ordering setup, decor, etc., I can definitely see the similarity to Chipotle that other reviewers have commented on.  As another reviewer mentioned, it was pleasantly uncrowded--a rarity during peak lunch hours in Oakland.  If you're looking for a quick carry out lunch in Oakland without fighting the crowd, this is a good alternative to Oishii Bento across the street and the chains on Forbes Ave.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Assembly-line sushi probably goes against everything that sushi stands for...but it is also a genius business concept.  The rolls here are HUGE. And...not bad! The fish was surprisingly fresh. I did think that there was too much rice on the roll (especially considering how big they get when you stuff them with two proteins and three veggies) and the rice was a little over-vinegared. But hey, for fast food sushi...I've had much, much worse. And on the plus side, if you ask for masago, they heap tons of the stuff on. Yuuum.  While it's not the best sushi ever, I know I would totally come here at least once a week if I still lived in Oakland."}
{"text":"Fast tasty and does not taste \"fast food\" manufactured. The sizes were decent. Fish was fresh."}
{"text":"The 4 star rating is mainly for the price. Sushi Fuku offers a selection of sushi rolls found in most places, mostly as your regular combinations of tempura, salmon, tuna, unagi, shrimp, avocado, cucumber, etc. The alternative, if you prefer to eat the contents of your sushi as a rice bowl, is just that--you can choose to either \"roll it\" or \"bowl it.\" Bowl ordering is set up like a lunch line; you choose the type of rice, the meat, the veggies, the sauce, etc.  I've found the ingredients to be actually quite fresh the few times that I've been here. Being able to find normally expensive ingredients such as unagi or avocado at such low prices is a rarity in the area, and while not filled to the brim you do get a fair share if you choose to order them in your bowls or rolls.  The owners are quite friendly, and they sometimes come outside to convince you to go to their place rather than Oishii across the street. While Oishii does have a lot more variety, I sometimes prefer Sushi Fuku if I'm not too hungry or craving some sushi and fish for cheap. In addition, it's usually a lot emptier than Oishii; I never see more than two tables occupied, so seating is never a problem."}
{"text":"Sushi Fuku is definitely  the sushi place to go in Oakland! They don't have the biggest of menus, but what they offer is delicious. First up you can choose if you wanna go for sushi, a bowl or even a salad. Then choose brown or white rice (without paying extra!). You don't have to actually order the sushi rolls that are on the menu as you can also create your own. The sushi I had there was always really fresh. I am particularly picky with raw salmon and tuna, but the quality they offer is just really good.The staff is super friendly and fun. They always brighten up my late dine dinners before heading back to work! The place is quite small but if you're not heading there at 12pm  you should be fine. I haven't used their rewards program yet, but I'll definitely check that out next time I am getting one of their Twin City Rolls! yum!"}
{"text":"If you go fifteen minutes before closing time, you get a \"oh crap\" !! Either you make my meal or tell me you are closed so I can go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is the best way of having sushi rolls. Its like making sushi at home without all the work.  You pick the meat you want then add whatever you like inside.  No mess no fuss.  Its fast and its good. If you like sushi, you have to try this place.  You'll get addicted to making it with different combinations.  Its fast food Japanese style.  Great concept!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that people compare this place to Chipotle- I freakin' love Chipotle. Their ingredients are fresh, sustainably raised food, and most important of all, packed with flavor. The three star for Fuku is for its price point and convenience.  I'm OK with the machine that stamp out the rice on rolls. What I am not OK with is that the rice and seaweed are both not treated. Rice was incredibly dry, with no rice vinegar or salt. The seaweed was just that- dry sheet blandness.  The fillings were fine, and the rice-filling ratio wasn't as that bad. The vegetable ingredients were fresh. The fish, well no problems since I was OK with the quality I paid for."}
{"text":"I walk in and it just makes sense.  I'm surprised nobody had thought of customizable sushi  before (e.g. subway, qdoba style).  From what I hear, the sushi chef from Taiwan Cafe moved to Sushi Fuku.  Having been a fan of the sushi from Taiwan Cafe, I ventured into Sushi Fuku.  Not realizing I was going to be given so many options, I asked for a traditional tuna roll.  My lack of desire to customize seemed to confuse them, but it all worked out.  The sushi was really good.  My only complaint is that the pieces are pretty big.  I don't understand why you'd make pieces so big.  You can't cut sushi.  So you are forced to shove the whole thing in your mouth, chewing like a chipmunk, apologizing to your co-worker for being rude (but I can't help it!).  Anyhow, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Interesting Concept. Build-your-own sushi roll. I like that you can choose what goes into your sushi, but you're paying too much for low quality ingredients. They're also a little skimpy on the fish and meat. The rolls are pretty large but it's mostly rice.   Everything is mechanized. They use machines to spread the rice, cut the sushi, etc. That's pretty interesting to see. This place is located in a college town and that's who they're catering to, so I guess you can't expect too much."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite spots for cheap-ish eats in Oakland. I am happy to say that after a recent visit, it is still one of my favorite places. Other review have called it \"sushi Chipotle,\" and that's pretty accurate. It's a unique approach to sushi, but what keeps me coming back is the ingredient quality. The fish is always very fresh and the veggies are always crisp and delicious. It may not be the best sushi I have ever eaten, but for the price and customizability, it's definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"The Concept: Sushi done Subway/Chipolte style.   've been to Sushi Fuku twice now. I've been more then satisfied by both rolls that i've had here. The workers are very nice, and idk about other people, but the lady working put a ton of meat and veggies into mine. The ingredients tasted fresh and even my fiance, who isn't a sushi fan, said it was very tasty. I got the rainbow roll with spicy mayo on it, and I honestly don't remember what i had the firs time, but it was tasty as well. I will probably come here again if i am in the general area and in the mood for sushi. I will make my own concoction next time!"}
{"text":"After church today I was feeling quite ravenous and in the mood for some sushi, so my sister and I decided to head to the closest sushi place, which happened to be here. Although we had been hoping for a dine-in option, we decided to order anyway and eat in the park a few blocks away.   The menu was easy to understand and fairly simple, which for someone who is incredibly hungry and wants food immediately rather than being confronted with endless choice options is a huge benefit. We both went with the make-your-own bowl option, and it was a great choice. I don't know that sushi connoisseurs would necessarily approve of the bowl/burrito format, but the finished product is wonderful as far as taste goes.   The ingredients in the bowl I ordered were fresh and tasty, the sushi rice was at its peak stickiness/sweetness combination, and the price was fair for the amount of food and the satisfaction index. I will definitely be back and recommending to others!"}
{"text":"Recommended.   like Subway but for sushi! sushi bowl at @Sushi Fuku in Oakland  pick your protein: Tuna, Unagi  pock your veggies upto 4: Kim Chi, Avacado, seaweed salad (x2)  pick your rice: brown  #OnPoint #GreatIdea"}
{"text":"I crave sushi pretty much 24/7 and I work in the Oakland area, so having Sushi Fuku around is absolutely fantastic. Everything I've eaten from there has been delicious and very fresh. They have a great variety of different choices of proteins, veggies, and toppings so pretty much everyone can find something they like on the menu. Their yum-yum sauce is ridiculously tasty, I put it on everything I order from there. I love the design-your-own bowl or roll idea and it's executed really well here. This location can get busy during the afternoon, but the staff does a good job of getting everyone's orders completed quickly. I really like that I can order takeout on Yelp beforehand and just go grab my order during my lunch break. Highly recommend overall!"}
{"text":"The sushi and bowls are great quality food. The only issue with this location is that they are very slow even with just a few people in line they struggled to keep up. Other than that the location is nice but just a little cramped."}
{"text":"Very good food and quick service. I ordered with 3 classmates on a Saturday night. I got to choose the ingredients for a poke bowl that were all in containers right in front of me.  You can design your own bowl or if you're like me you can choose a pre-designed one although there was only one option. Thankfully it was good! Two of my classmates chose sushi rolls instead of a bowl.   The place had plenty of seating and was moderately busy for a Saturday night in Oakland. I ate there and it was clean inside. Most of the patrons looked to be college students. The manager offered to clean up for me which was great but I was happy to throw away my own trash.   I got water to drink but there is a soda fountain with unlimited refills as well. I don't hang out in Oakland often but would be happy to go back next time."}
{"text":"I've ordered spicy salmon roll again. Only one word can describe my feeling: awesome. As a Japanese food lover, the rice in the roll somehow is a little bit less than expect, but how can we expect more with total amount of 7.25 with 10 p! Further, the flavor still good!"}
{"text":"The line moves fast at this sushi mto assembly line...too fast. I asked several times to skip their teriyaki sauce on my roll but alas...I watched as the employee put the stuff on my lunch! Ugh. So beware if you go off script with one of their menu items. The roll itself is a good size and was a filling lunch (for me). I got the special for restaurant week...shrimp tempura roll. It was delicious.  I also grabbed a miso soup on that cold day. This took much too long to procure from the kitchen. I stood at the checkout and waited. Off to the left against the wall is an assortment of soy sauces and plastic ware etc. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is #awesome - Great vibe, very clean, #sushi -made-to-order all for a very economical price. For the non-sushi lovers, check out the \"Oakland Roll\" It's crispy chicken (deep fried), #bacon and other good stuff, and you still look cool and hip without eating something that you are not 100% sure about!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the menu you can choose from, the employees working there, being able to see how they make the rolls, and the actual rolls are tasty. Sure, it's not some magical concept for sushi and everyone has their spot they prefer, but this place has yet to disappoint me.  I usually get some version of a crunchy roll or spicy roll with salmon and I always get wasabi mayo. You can ask for extras in a container on the side. I don't usually eat in so I can't say much about the inside other than it's clean and rather small. I like not having to sit down and wait for my sushi to be brought to me by a waiter. This is efficient for people on the go such as myself."}
{"text":"Convenient sushi shop for college kids.  The assembly line setup is really good for getting orders through, but still, lines can still get pretty held back at peak hours.  The food is just alright. The manager is pretty cheap on toppings and fish, so you won't get your filling for just one order. The fish quality is pretty mediocre---you know it's definitely frozen, and sometimes they don't even bother to defrost it all the way before serving it to you. Toppings are also pretty limited, which really makes it difficult to get any satisfying order without paying a lot. The bowls are worse than the rolls, I'd say, because they tend to give you a ton of rice and not much fish and toppings."}
{"text":"Sushi Fuku is the sushi equivalent to Panda Express. I'm a sushi-lover myself, and Oakland doesn't exactly fulfill my cravings, but I've given Sushi Fuku a fair share of chances. The reason I make the Panda Express comparison is because of how it Americanizes sushi. For those who are uncertain when it comes to raw fish, Sushi Fuku is suitable (cooked chicken, mayo, crunchy, cream cheese, steak, bacon as options).   All in all, the atmosphere is nice for a quick lunch with a friend, and it's pretty affordable. I like the sushi \"bowl\" option, but the toppings to rice ratio is always off."}
{"text":"One day a man had a dream.  Probably not an inspiring \"I have a dream\" kind of dream, but more likely a poorly understood collection of images viewed while unconscious and only vaguely remembered.  At any rate, this man woke up one day from his slumber and said, \"Hey, I like Qdoba and Chipotle, but instead of burritos, could I customize rolls of extremely inauthentic sushi from limited options?  And make sure it's mostly rice.\"  BAM!  Sushi Fuku was born.  So pick a protein, some add-ons, a sauce and a type of rice, and throw it all together in a bowl or a roll (yes, it rhymes, and yes, you can't walk 2 feet in the place without being reminded of it).  It's not bad, but once the limited novelty wears off, that's about all you can say of the place.  It's sushi fast food, and though I felt it was a little overpriced (though admittedly each roll is quite large), I'll probably wind up back here.  Especially if the line is longer at Chipotle."}
{"text":"If you are looking for gourmet sushi, then you might want to check out somewhere else. But if you are looking at quick, made to order, and cheap(er) sushi then you should definitely check sushi fuku out! Chipotle style, pick what you want in your sushi and enjoy :) they can make your sushi into a burrito and they have teriyaki bowls as well (which I haven't tried either)"}
{"text":"Healthy Japanese sushi version of Chipotle. Consistent, tasty, but they're quite skimpy on the fish... What's the deal? I'd give a B+ for tastiness but B for value. I'll still go there for lunch but would find another snack or two to truly feel satiated."}
{"text":"I've seen a lot of mixed reviews about this place. It's clean, roomy, and has an enjoyable atmosphere. Yes, you can make your own sushi combinations, and some may be gross but the orderer is responsible for their combinations. They have a good selection of featured rolls which didn't disappoint anyone in my group. The staff was friendly and I enjoyed my meal very much."}
{"text":"Delicious, large portions and friendly service.  Always my favorite place for lunch and dinner, plus they sometimes have great specials on bowls! If you've never had sushi before, if you love it, or even tolerate it as a food option, hit up this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place and it's right by my office in Oakland!  The sushi is fresh and I love the flexibility to get it prepared many different ways, either in a chirashi bowl format, a burrito, or a standard sushi roll.  They let you choose what kind of fish you want, veggie and other toppings, type of rice, several different sauces, etc. It's like the Chipotle of sushi.  The staff are always very friendly and efficient and there is a comfortable seating area."}
{"text":"SETTING Cool modern look with big screens on the wall to walk you through the ordering process. Casual. Chipotle/Subway-esque \"made to your order\" assembly line. Clean environment, which is hard to find in Oakland.  FOOD I don't think Sushi Fuku is trying to be a fancy sushi joint. It knows it's place in the sushi market and efficiently cranks out rolls that attempt to be the \"best bang for your buck\", only that there wasn't much \"bang\".  I made my own roll: Brown rice (choose white or brown), shrimp tempura (choose 1 meat), avocado, cucumbers, kimchi (choose 3 veggies), wasabi ginger sauce and sesame seeds (choose 2 sauces). Rice was kind of dry, avocado was browning a bit, and they gave me carrots instead of the cucumbers I asked for. They do have some creative sauces, though. I went with the wasabi ginger sauce, and it was okay. I like putting ginger on sushi, and they only give you a few small pieces on the side.  Everything just seemed a bit dry and bland. I'm not a sushi snob, but when I eat sushi, I prefer the rice to be a bit vinegary and a tiny bit moist and have the avacodos fresh. I LOVE avocados.  SERVICE Fast. They definitely have the assembly line down pat, which helps during busy lunch hours. Order and pay up front, then seat yourself.  IMPRESSIONS For 10 pieces at $7 (unless you order a menu item), it's not a bad deal, but I feel there are a few basic requirements that a properly made sushi needs to meet. Unfortunately that was not the case here. However, if you need a fast and light lunch on a budget you might want to give Sushi Fuku a try."}
{"text":"I work close by and have been anticipating the opening all winter long, and the other sushi offering on Craig Street is subpar. I walked by and saw that they were having their soft opening so I decided to try it, because it's Friday and why not?  I tried the Sashimi bowl with sprouts and avocado and brown rice. The quality of the fish is decently fresh tasting, and the service was fast. I wish they would have built the space out a little more to include seating, but beggars can't be choosers.  I am still really like this concept and think they put it in a great location and for sushi the price point isn't too bad. The rolls still come with 10 pieces and I was glad to see some new menu offerings that I'll have to try another time. I hope this place does well!"}
{"text":"As evidenced by how many times I've been here in one week, I'm in love. As someone who loves sushi, but dislikes the seaweed paper, they make it so simple and easy to get what I want without the stuff I don't want.  I typically get a chirasi bowl with salmon and cream cheese. I like nigiri sushi so this is the perfect option for me in terms of similarity.  The prices are decent; a bowl that certainly fills me up is about $10 or so depending on if you add extra protein or mix ins."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch last Friday, and while the place was pretty busy, there were just enough tables for the eat-in crowd.  That was nice.  There are paper copies of the menu as you enter as well as a giant menu posted on the wall where you wait in line.  The two of us split 3 rolls, which was more than enough for a lunch, and reasonably priced on that front (with drinks, about $20). We tried one of their house rolls, the Korean roll, and I wasn't super impressed.  The kimchi was far too mild and the roll lacked the punchy flavors one would expect.  Our designed rolls were pretty good.  The fish is a pretty good quality, and the vegetables are all sliced properly such that they give a pleasant texture and an even distribution.  But the rice is pretty sad.  It's too thick a layer and too glopped together.  This may be a function of the machine, but this is something they should try to address.  One of our create-your-own rolls was a particular success--bacon, cream cheese, jalapenos, and scallions, with sriracha mayo on top.  If only they had tempura flakes--I could have made it a true jalapeno popper roll!  I wouldn't recommend their house rolls as they aren't authentic enough to live up to their simplicity, but this place is definitely worth a visit if you always had a hankering for some strange sushi concoction and you don't know how to roll your own.  This won't be my new \"go-to\" lunch spot, but it's a good contender among the rest of Oakland's options."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm going to be totally honest - the name initially drew me to this newest addition to the Oakland sushi scene. Yeah, it's the seventh grader in me perhaps. But c'mon - the place IS named Fuku. Admit it. You just smiled.   You know what else will make you smile? The sushi options here! Based on the Chipotle/Noodles & Co. approach of \"choose your own adventure food,\" Sushi Fuku allows you to build your own rolls with options such as white or brown rice, a variety of fish (including eel - yea!) and non-fish proteins, interesting veggie choices (such as the Korean treat kimchi), and tantalizing toppings like wasabi mayo.   I withheld one star only because this place gets PACKED weekdays at lunch, so you'll end up standing in line for quite a long time and probably won't find a place to sit. I also wish they had more adventurous options for the specialty rolls. Several of them aren't even made with fish. However, this is likely due to the typical Pittsburgher's less than daring palate. (Frankly, I'm surprised none of the specialty rolls are topped with fries. This is something they might want to consider for the Pittsburgh area.)  Overall, this place is worth a lunchtime visit. Just try to avoid going right at noon, unless you love long lines and eating while you stand."}
{"text":"It's fast food sushi at its finest. Choose your ingredients: protein, rice, veggies, sauce, etc. and they will 1.) Roll it up  2.) Make a rice bowl  3.) Make a salad bowl. Mine was delicious, fast and fresh. With more then I could eat (I went for bowl option). The only thing I'll pass on next time was the Fuku chips. Not my favorite. Going to try a roll next visit.  I wish there was this kind of restaurant for ALL my favorite ethnic foods (is that terrible to say?) Not for every meal, but perfect for fresh. fast lunch on the go that's not your burger fast food. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Food: 2.75 Service: 3  Really just a takeout sushi place, as there is minimal seating at this location (much less than the Oakland location).  You can make your own sushi roll (or even a sushi burrito!), or select from suggested combos.  The special sushi roll of the week that Ms Beffrey ordered was the Craig Street Roll, half eel half imitation crabmeat, with tempura shrimp and avocado topped with sweet chili sauce. Also ordered the California roll and a side seaweed salad (a steal at $2.50).  The rolls are very dense and incredibly filling.  Rice is okay, more of a binder rather than adding anything to the flavor profile, but pretty much what was expected for a \"fast food\" establishment.  This is a smooth takeout operation -- there's a machine that rolls the rice onto the seaweed, the staff packs the toppings and rolls it up, and a machine slices the rolls. Service was relatively fast.  If you have bad food allergies, would be wary of eating here, as there's no way the roll-slicer can be decontaminated between rolls."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fast, fresh, and delicious.  The customization of the rolls and the quality is an extra bonus.  Highly recommended!  And they move incredibly quick during busy times!"}
{"text":"Horrible, thank god for the ginger to get the taste out of my mouth. Go to Oshii Bento instead."}
{"text":"Sushi Fuku adapts the business model of Subway and Chipotle to...well you guessed it, Sushi. I like that the customer is encouraged to build their own roll, rice bowl, or salad. There is also no confusion about what is or is not available.   On the other hand, the model extracts the art of being a sushi chef from the process; that is, they have a machine to bed the rice on the seaweed, a machine to cut the roll,  and the fish all comes in pre-cut rectangular prisms. (Part of the sushi experience for me is finding a sushi chef who can perfectly cut along the seam of the fish which ensures a smooth taste to the fresh fish).  At Fuku, this mechanized process yields a huge roll (as you can pick three vegetable ingredients in addition to a meat or fish) with a disproportionate amount of rice at a reasonable price (my customized roll cost under $9). Which works out as the establishment is clearly target at college students."}
{"text":"There's a negative for every positive at this place. It's cheap, but the amount of food you get is sparse (I got a smoked salmon bowl that was filled mostly with rice). You can create your own rolls and bowls, but the selection is quite random and mostly fillers. The ordering process is quick and easy, but who knows how long the ingredients have been sitting out there."}
{"text":"At $8 a roll, 5 stars. Charging any more than that, I'd want to see them cut the fresh fish in the pieces (like in Wholey's in the Strip District). Watching the sushi chef make the cuts is part of the experience. Since it's cheap, and all the ingredients that will go into your roll is already prepared similar to Subway and Chipotle--it's a good deal.  I like salmon, brown rice, with tamago, avocado, cucumber, sesame seeds, and spicy mayo sauce on the side. And if I feel like paying $2 extra that day, the fish eggs (masago).   A warning about customizing your own roll-- **IT MIGHT NOT TASTE GOOD** Know what you're asking them to put in your roll. I made this mistake when I wanted to add everything that I liked, which basically taught me how kimchi doesn't taste great with everything.  If you've been reading the other reviews, yes, this place is very \"Americanized.\" They have a menu of uncommon ingredients such as bacon, (cold) chicken, and steak. English translations are also next to the Japanese names. They have quite a few original rolls with interesting combinations--Pittsburgh Roll, Oakland Roll, Twin City Roll, etc.   I always appreciate a sanitary restaurant. It's really clean with someone always cleaning the table and rearranging the chairs after a party leaves."}
{"text":"Sigh. I used to like this place a LOT when it first came out. I still advertise it to a lot of people too. But at the same time I think i've been disenchanted. After my one friend complained how little food you actually get I couldn't stop myself from feeling the same way when I visited again. I guess it makes sense for the price. The amount of rice is 2 or 3 times what it should be for the amount of meat they give you. They don't give you that much avocado either. Don't get me wrong- they're plenty generous when it comes to cucumber but that just doesn't cut it for me.   I think I've become jaded. I came here on the day it opened (i had subscribed to their fb page in extreme anticipation since i had first heard about it) and it was really nice to see such a modern interior in beautiful red and black. Maybe they DID give out more meat on that day. I also liked the sauces the guy recommended...an unexpected blend of eel sauce and creamy miso? And the free nori chips they were handing out were really yummy too. But alas, I'm not sure If i'm going back for bowls anymore. Maybe rolls, since the rice is rolled up and doesn't dwarf the meat/veggies. Or maybe I should just stop whining and pay the extra $2 for more salmon."}
{"text":"4 stars for concept/service, 2.5 stars for food/quality. I found Sushi Fuku on Yelp when my boyfriend and I were looking for a new sushi place to try out because our regular spot was closed for a special event. I was very surprised when we walked in because I was not expecting the Chipotlesque atmosphere at all. I was super impressed by the concept, selection and aesthetics. Where else can you have a sushi burrito or do a make your own roll? Awesome. We were not aware that the portions were larger than your average sushi eatery, so I ordered a Twin City roll and a Teriyaki Chicken Bowl. The prices were pretty low, so I figured that most people ordered several items. I was wrong. The portions were huge and even someone with as robust an appetite as I have should likely start off with one item (granted, I had just eaten ice cream prior to going for sushi).   The fish used in the roll (salmon/tuna) seemed fresh and the portion was decent, but when I started eating it, I just wasn't impressed. It wasn't NOT fresh, but it wasn't trying to swim around on my plate either, if you catch my drift. I found the seaweed wrapper to be extremely gummy with an unpleasant, overpowering flavor. I can't really put my finger on it because the roll wasn't awful, but I just didn't like it very much. My boyfriend ordered a rainbow roll and a golden dragon roll and felt the same way about his. I took a bite of the golden dragon roll and liked the crunch of the shrimp tempura (not soggy at all, which is good!). Unfortunately, the chicken teriyaki bowl was terrible. The \"chicken\" was either super low quality thigh meat or various chicken organs. It was chewy and gross. The veggies tasted too floral (the carrots literally tasted like lavender or something, which was weird) and the sauce did not taste like teriyaki sauce. One star for the chicken teriyaki bowl.   The service was quick and helpful and someone who I assume was the owner came over to chat with us (joking about how our eyes were bigger than our stomachs!), which I liked. The tables were clean and the condiments/utensils bar well-stocked. I was not impressed with the food at Sushi Fuku, but would be willing to give it another go and try different menu items if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Like a fast food sushi place. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I like the concept but the execution is lacking.  The sushi rolls are meh at best and the rice bowl I ordered was pretty much inedible."}
{"text":"I grabbed some sushi to go last weekend.  It smelled a bit fishy (which should've been enough of a warning sign, but we ignored it).  Sushi tasted OK.  Wife's been sick for two days after eating it.  Won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"First time here , the sushi burrito is great, it was essentially make your own type thing with a Chipotle like bar. The food was fairly fresh and the burrito came out really good, would recommend !"}
{"text":"Good sushi, can choose what you want. The portions are big, so you don't need to get a ton of different things."}
{"text":"Great place for takeout. Everything is fresh and made in front of you. Staff is efficient. So even if there's a line you won't be waiting long. With the chipotle like concept, the line moves fast.   I got the rice bowl and everything tastes fresh  and the flavor were balanced, which was great. Seating is limited, especially if you are coming in large groups. It's perfect for a quick lunch though. Will be going back to try other items. It's just a tad but expensive."}
{"text":"I can't say I'm too excited about Sushi Fuku. I have been here several times and have tried their rolls and bowls. You're pretty limited by the number and amount of ingredients you can add to a bowl. They even have a limit to the number of veggies that can be added to an order. I think the food here is overpriced and the quality of the fish isn't that great.   The line moves quickly, but then again, not many people frequent Sushi Fuku compared to the numerous neighboring businesses."}
{"text":"It should be 7. I love the place - the price is good and the food is fresh. I always ordered the salad. I just hope that they will come to Squirrel Hill to open a store."}
{"text":"Described as \"Chipotle for sushi\", I was excited to try Sushi Fuku. I brought my daughter who loves sushi for lunch. The description is perfect. Pick bowl or wrap(seaweed instead of a burrito), pick rice(brown/white), pick your meat(they have cooked meats too), pick 3 veg, and then pick 2 sauces. There are a few other customizations available, but basically that's it. Could it be any more like Chipotle?  Verdict: we loved it. I had a tuna and salmon bowl (it's a few bucks to get two meats) and my kiddo had a tuna roll. The rolls are enormous so she only finished 7/10 pieces. I finished about 5/6 of my bowl. The kiddo did have a bit of a problem with the size of the sushi pieces. She had to take multiple bites of each one so some of them fall apart. She's used to her food falling apart so she didn't mind, but I can see being annoyed by that.  Incidentally, I am adding the \"rice spreading machine\" and roll cutting machine\" to my Christmas list. Quite cool.  Next time I'd like to try the cooked chicken and have a warm bowl."}
{"text":"Have been to Sushi Fuku several times. Would give a 3.5/5 stars. A great concept of create your own sushi, sushi bowls, or sushi burrito. I opted for a create your own sushi with salmon, cream cheese, avocado, cucumber, red onion, and a spicy mayo and yum-yum sauce. All the options can be overwhelming and I am always afraid I will pick a bad tasting combination.   Their prices are reasonable for sushi about $8 for a salmon roll with tax. The roll was pretty good. I liked the crunch from the red onion and the sauces added a nice flavor. Unfortunately, they put so much sauce on I really couldn't taste the salmon too much. My friend got a teriyaki chicken sushi bowl and was pleased. A convenient place for decent sushi if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Like others have said this is the Chipotle of the sushi world.  You stand in line and tell one person if you want a sushi roll, bowl, or salad.  Then your food is handed off to the next employee where they ask what you want in your sushi.  Finally your food gets handed off to a third employee and adds in whatever type of sauce and finishes off your dish before handing it to you.  Price - Around what I would expect.  I had an eel roll for $7.   Portion - At first I thought \"how can one roll possibly fill me up?\" but I was struggling with that last piece.  The roll is bigger than your typical roll.   Ambiance - Minimalistic Asian inspired I would say.  They have a wall of condiments so you can grab as much soy soy, siracha, etc. for your dish.  I wouldn't recommend coming here in a big group because the tables are set up so you either sit by yourself or in a table for two people. Location - GREAT location if you work/live/or go to school at Pitt.    Great for vegans and vegetarians and you can get as crazy and inauthentic as you like.  My friend made a roll with asparagus, cream cheese, and crab.  We all enjoyed our meals and will be coming back."}
{"text":"It was better than my expectations but my expectations were really low, but I enjoyed it. I really enjoyed making my own bowl, that spicy sauce was good! I liked the variety and the ability to choose what you wanted and the quality was great too!!"}
{"text":"I am a recent sushi convert, but I am still pretty picky when it comes to your average sushi options.  I'm pretty willing to try any protein, but I can't stand the texture of avacodo, and don't like the taste of cream cheese.  This makes finding a sushi roll I'll enjoy fairly difficult off a normal sushi menu.  I was pretty excited when I heard about this place, and have eaten there 3 times in less than a month. As far as sushi goes, the rolls are by no means the best sushi I've ever tasted, but they're reasonably priced, and fairly large.  A whole roll definitely fills me up for lunch, and I will continue to be a patron of sushi fuku, and recommend it to sushi-lovers in the area."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I like you Sushi Fuku, I really do. However your customer service started badly but then ended up good. My husband comes here for lunch quite frequently and likes your food so I decided to give it a try. I visited before the lunch rush so no one was there and not knowing what to do I started to read the menu of how I should order and then a team member asked what I wanted. I replied back asking for help on a custom bowl since it was my first time and his response was \"you pick your ingredients like for the rolls.\" I thought his reply was a bit rude since I had no idea how many ingredients and what kind and had never ordered a roll before (this was probably compounded by the fact I just had some dental work done) but then luckily the other team member on the floor swooped in to help me. She told me to pick a protein and then four vegetables along with a sauce. I ended up with the eel, brown rice, avocado, tomago, fried tofu and kimchi topped with a teriyaki sauce from her recommendation. Finally she wished me a good day with a smile and that put Sushi Fuku back into the positive for me. The meal itself was great considering the price at $10 and eel is expensive!! The eel was cooked and marinated well, the toppings were good and the rice was moist.  However as other reviewers have said the space is really only for take out - where you order is small and there are maybe two seats in the front so know where you will eat your food from Sushi Fuku afterwards."}
{"text":"Sushi Fuku?!?  I feel like I'm in an Austin Powers movie. But I digress.  SF is a tiny little restaurant in Oakland, directly beside another sushi restaurant, Mt. Everest.  It's set up like a west coast Poky place, or a Subway. You order at one end, they build your meal, you pick up and pay.   The food. They have a small menu. It's essentially rolls, bowls, burritos and some apps.  The burrito is really the star of the show. They place a full sheet of nori under this machine and it craps out the perfect rice spread.  They then add the proteins and toppings of your choice and roll it all up in tin foil like Chipotle.  It's big, it's fresh and it's delicious!   The only complaint I would make is that the only fish they have is tuna and salmon.  It's not like a traditional sushi or poke place with lots of options.  I think they had some chicken but I'm not positive.  The place is clean and the soft drinks are refillable.   If you're in the neighborhood it's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"cheap, delicious and fast sushi rolls, burritos, and chirashi bowls. I can see myself coming here for lunch everyday. The tuna tasted fresh. The inside decor was clean and spacious with well-maintained bathrooms. definitely better than sushi boat."}
{"text":"Great place for consistently good sushi in Oakland. The line gets long during lunch but it moves quickly. I usually go for a chirashi bowl to go. I love the yum yum sauce!"}
{"text":"This is the chipotle of sushi, service is quick and fun and it's a great quick dining stop. It obviously won't be top quality jiro dreams of sushi level, but it's more than good for the price."}
{"text":"Sushi Fuku has to be the most put together single location restaurant  I've had. They sell amazing sushi and rice bowls. Hands down the best rice."}
{"text":"Always come here on my lunch break, it's quick and fresh. You can make your own rice bowls and get fresh sushi. The staff is friendly and always makes whatever you want."}
{"text":"Sushi Fuku is always a cheap treat if you're tired of eating cafeteria food! I love that they have brown rice as an option. I like their smoked salmon option. Plus, the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I love sushi fuku, basically it is a sushi express. You choose what you want in your sushi, they make it in front of you. What's not to like ? The sushi rolls are good size too, and reasonable price. I come here way too often. They always satisfy my tummy though :) way to go Fuku!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem. I've never been to a place like this!  So it's basically Japanese chipotle. I'm not a big sushi eater, so this place is actually perfect for me! I always order the bowls with teriyaki chicken and I'm able to get any kind of vegetables and sauces I want! They even have yum-yum sauce like Hibachi restaurants! When my brother comes to visit he always loves coming here!  The employees are super nice and helpful and the pricing isn't too bad. Come give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Today I bought the volcano roll. As soon as I took my first bite, I noticed that the salmon tasted terrible. This is the second time I have been here that the fish was disgusting. I paid 10.00 for a roll I can't even eat. I do not recommend this place if you want fresh sushi."}
{"text":"The place was empty on Saturday around lunchtime. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and the golden dragon roll. I enjoy Sushi Fuku much more than it's competitor across the street (Oiishi Bento). The chicken teriyaki bowl is larger and has more vegetable toppings for roughly the same price. The golden dragon roll, which contains tempura, avocado, and salmon, was disappointing. The roll was equivalent to a supermarket sushi roll (e.g. Safeway, Whole Foods)."}
{"text":"One of the better food stops on Craig street. You can create you own bowl, sushi roll, or sushi burrito, or you can choose from one of their preset options. They have a good selection of toppings (including tofu, salmon, spicy crab etc. for proteins). I particularly like how they have seaweed, edamame, and inari as \"veggies\".  I've never seen too much of a line here, and I've always been able to find seating.  Don't expect life changingly delicious food, but this place is great for a quick lunch or dinner that's not too expensive."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today for some lunch with a couple of friends! I've been to the Oakland location a couple of times but this was my first time coming to this one on Craig Street. It was pretty empty so there was no line, but the staff was very polite and service was fast.  I ordered a chirashi bowl with a side of gyoza. And my other friend ordered a shrimp tempura roll. They were both good. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. It's nice that you get to pick what you want in your bowl/roll so you're not stuck with things that you don't want. Prices can be a little expensive but for the portion and the fresh ingredients, I think they're mainly okay."}
{"text":"Worst sushi place I have ever gone... A total waste of my money and appetite. I don't want to admit they are making sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi with training wheels.  This is where I take my friends to try sushi if they have never had it before. Lots of selections and many cooked options for a good price. You can choose a established combination or choose your own. I caution you that if you choose your own to be familiar with the ingredients as not to make something that doesn't taste good.  It's kind of like subway for sushi.   I f you have someone who has been scared of trying sushi this is a perfect place to take them."}
{"text":"Great prices and even better sushi. Went in to grab some quick lunch to go and it was super fast. Will most definitely go there more often when I'm in Oakland."}
{"text":"Sushi are more America style ,large and lots of choice.it is a good choice for lunch- fast and taste really good. I like twin city roll"}
{"text":"The restaurants employees were pretty friendly (spoke Chinese to me, but I struggled a bit with conversation because my Chinese is a bit rusty :) ). The tables and chairs were clean, but a downside is that the seating area is pretty small, so it can easily get cramped. I enjoyed my \"make my own\" sushi and there are many other options other than the typical sushi roll (a bowl, vegetarian options, etc). I thought my smoke salmon tasted fresh and the other ingredients were typical. I'd definitely come again!"}
