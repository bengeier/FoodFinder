{"text":"Not China Town, but more like China Oasis

This is the closest thing to a China Town in Phoenix.  There is not comparison to the ones in LA or NY, but there is a lot of character present.  I usually come here for Dim Sum at Golden Buddha and go to the L Ranch Supermarket, but it is small and quaint, but does give a fun representation of the Zen Chinese in the Koi Fish Pond and garden.  Don't expect LA or NY China Town, but not bad for the desert. 

If you find this useful, funny or cool, please check below."}
{"text":"The Ranch Market is the ONLY place I have been able to find that has had my miniature money tree!! I have looked all over the Untied States since my last one died with no luck until today. Needless to say I was absolutely thrilled beyond belief!!! I must also give them credit for promptly returning my lost LV wallet! THANK YOU for being honest!!! =)

The import store over next to the Golden Buddha has a great selection of different Chinese figurines, Buddhas, furniture, bamboo, fountains, miniature tea sets, Hung Bao, etc... Always a joy to go in there and browse around. Last time I walked out of there $200 poorer!! hehehe 

Check it out. It's a small complex but lots of browsing fun. Enjoy."}
{"text":"COFCO Chinese Cultural Center is located in Phoenix, Arizona; it is downtown and fairly easy to locate. There are several different stores and restaurants located within the center that anyone may go and explore when they want to. On my first journey here I parked outside of the supermarket called Ranch Market. On the outside and on the inside it looks like a typical grocery store that you would find in Arizona, such as a Safeway of Fry's; the only main difference is the produce and items that they sell. Each aisle is stocked with unique foods, candies, drinks... Their fresh produce section, along with their \"deli\" section was the most interesting thing to me personally.  You can find crazy colored and shaped produce that you typically would never see at a Safeway. The \"deli\" section was filled with baby octopus to fresh fish. Ranch Market offers many Chinese cultural foods. The only main down side is that it smelled strongly of seafood, because of their foods they offer in the market. 

Visiting the market, my friend and I walked around the rest of the center. We found the Chinese Cultural Botanical Garden. This was my favorite part of the whole center, because it is a beautiful garden set up around a large pond filled with lily pads, fountains, statues, and koi fish. Around the pond you could walk along a path that had interesting marble statues that you could read, observe, and touch if you wanted to. The statues had plaques in English and Chinese that you could read, in order to learn the history of what it is that you were looking at. The Botanical Garden is nicely set up as a little journey pathway. The architecture is extremely interesting and vibrant. I did not think that there was a single down side but I would suggest that you go the the botanical garden when it is nice and cool outside. Because it is all outside, you would not want to be walking around trying to enjoy it in 100 degree weather. 

Lastly my friend and I decided to walk into a small shop called The Oriental Factory Direct. This was a shop filled to the brim with Chinese cultural artifacts, clothing, weapons, pieces of art, jewelery, stationary... You could find almost anything in this shop. The atmosphere was extremely welcoming and calming. My favorite part of this shop was looking around at everything they offered for me to buy. The shop keeper was also tremendously friendly; she was eager to answer any of our questions and teach us anything we wanted to learn about. I loved the atmosphere and the people here.

I gave the COFCO Chinese Cultural Center  a good rating, because I completely enjoyed the new experience. It can be a good drive for some people, but if you live near it, it is extremely convenient. The only thing I would have done differently was given myself more time to enjoy the other restaurants and shops. And i definitely would have gone when it was cooler outside. This center is very unique, beautiful, and fun."}
{"text":"We go here all the time. Whole family loves it. Enjoy some good food at the grocery store while you're there."}
{"text":"They have a 99 Ranch supermarket that stocks all the awesome asian necessities like tendon, tripe and chicken feet. However,the area is almost barren with hardly any businesses. They should really step this place up do some development and market this area. They have plenty of parking which is non-existant back home in Honolulu."}
{"text":"After a couple days without caffeine, I was in the panicked, desperate, yet very composed search for instant coffee. I am traveling and coffee seems to be weak tea everywhere I've gone and I am too cheap to buy Starbucks every morning.Through previous experiences, Korean instant coffee packs are quite delightful! So I was on the search for said coffee packs. To begin my expedition I asked where I'd fine an Asian store, I was directed to a small store and after looking, they did not have what I was searching for. My second option found me here. Much smaller than what I expected, but I was able to find a product similar to the brand I was seeking and was completely satisfied!  Great products and very organized."}
{"text":"When I want to just get away for awhile I come here, and let my mind relax...over all its not that big but worth checking out!!  It also has food and shops to enjoy this great culture."}
{"text":"Flavoring is not consistent. Sometimes it could be salty enough to do more than 
double serving. Counter Service were really poor as You have to wait and look for them."}
{"text":"Honestly I go here rarely.  My recent visit was to watch my godson while his parents were doing family picture photo shoot in the Chinese gardens and pond areas.  You can walk the whole cultural center and its gardens in 10 minutes, so there isn't alot of sightseeing here.  But to get a little glimpse of some replica gardens and seating structures from China, where else to go?  So 4 stars for the somewhat idyllic gardens in back behind the shopping plaza, cuz there isn't any other place in the valley like it."}
{"text":"I love visiting the Chinese Cultural Center. There's a really cool replica garden and quite a few restaurants. I'm always drawn to the Ranch Market full of Asian goodies. This market reminds me of the stores I used to frequent in Seattle/Tacoma. I haven't actually eaten at any of the restaurants there yet, but it's coming. What a great place to go check out something different and check out some new foods in the market."}
{"text":"Most of the place is closed right now. I was told it was remodeling but I am not sure.  What is there is good but there is not much to see right now at the cultural center."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times and have said to myself that I need to go and check it out. Well with it being the 2013 Phoenix Chinese Week, I had no reason not too. 

The architecture is pretty neat. 

The market has some many cool and different products you will not find at Frys or Safeway. I could spend a good two hours going up and down the isles checking everything out. 

There is an herbal store the smelled of earthy tea upon entering. I quickly became overwhelmed as everything was in Chinese (which for the record I cannot read or speak, outside of the brief lesson when I open a fortune cookie). They had so many containers and boxes that I chalked up that if I'm really that interested, I'll make another trip in the future when it isn't so crowded."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood stop and as close to what you get for a \"china town\" here in PHX.

The Ranch Market is my grocery store and the Golden Buddha is the watering hole I am closest to and its been fun to be exposed to something \"different\" in the neighborhood. Yeah it's a strip mall with a coy pond and garden to those in other more metropolitan back ground or source, but it's what we got! ( I knocked off that last star for a reality check).  Within the center their are doctors offices, apartments and travel agencies that specialize in travel to Asia. Our stops signs are in Chinese too to paint a picture. All nationalities get their fresh fish at the market and you have to try the bakery for arguably the best chau siu bao hands down.

A definite place to go for lunch if you are here.
Walking through the gardens is the best attraction to walk off the dum sum. Its ponds and series of bridges and temple type architecture will make you feel less like you are under the flight path of PHX and more like you are on a different latitude and longitude if even for a second... 

Adjacent to the airport it represents a grain of cultural sand in a desert of fast food restaurants and Circle K's that is most of phoenix.
Short walking distance from the 44th ST Light rail station where one could possible stumble to while on a light rail jaunt Tempe / PHX bound.  Also next to main airport destination and hotels including a \"W\" and parking to the airport.

It's a pretty industrialized neighborhood outside but it contains some of the best Chinese restaurants in the valley as well Chinese medicine shop and other various shops hardly found anywhere else in AZ."}
{"text":"Phoenix has a large but scattered population. I'm not sure why developers picked this location for a Chinese Culture Center.  It doesn't make sense to me as the area around Dobson might seem more appropriate.

The center seems like it'd have potential if it gave incentive for small businesses to set up shop and stay.  I've heard the lunar festival held here charged admission and was dismal.  It's now not much more than a nearly-empty strip mall with \"Asian\" architecture.  I live up the street and would rather drive to Mesa/Chandler for anything Asian. Sad because I hoped Phoenix could do better."}
{"text":"First off, this is not a china town as some keep trying to say and then act as if it were substandard. It is the Chinese Culture Center , big difference. And for what it is I enjoy stopping and checking out the various shops and restaurants along with the great grocery. As a whole I enjoy this place. This place that is not China Town."}
{"text":"If you go here expecting to find a \"China Town\" you will be disappointed.  However, this place does not market it's self as a Chinatown. It is a cultural center which holds special events and displays as related to the Chinese culture. What a great place to relax in the garden. Also has some wonderful restaurants, shops a business center and a Chinese grocery store there."}
{"text":"Glad to have stumbled upon this neat-o place. Bummed it doesn't have more activity though. I'm used to the hustle and bustle of China Town in L.A and S.F.
The supermarket there has ready to eat food, ie: duck and pho. Other neat things to buy too like tea sets, pots, fresh live fish, crab, clams, gooey duck, etc and a bakery."}
{"text":"It's not CLOSED!!!!!!!!!!! It went up for sale and the CHINESE Community offered the prior owners $13M they sold it and before they did they started dismantling the Chinese features of the building which is the roof. 

Very sad that the city din't step in and find some way to preserve it since the city paid for artisans from CHINA to help build and design it. 

Depending on how this transpires I won't be back if the Chinese Community is shut out of there!"}
{"text":"For being in the middle of Phoenix/desert, this place looks real nice. There are several events held here throughout the year including Chinese New Years celebrations and the Fall Moon Festival. Not usually the most entertaining performances. The International market that's in this center is AWESOME. You can find just about anything here that doesn't exist in the US!"}
{"text":"The smell, the vibe and feel as soon as I opened my car door was apparent. This is very Asian for the likes of pretty much every street corner in parts of LA. I only wish we had a more concentrated ethnic specific area beyond south Phoenix like LA.. or any other city for that matter. Hell, look at the Asian part of town in Vegas, its awesome!"}
{"text":"For Phoenix, this is pretty great. In all honesty it is only slightly worse than DC chinatown so we should be pretty proud. (DC just dubs over chains with chinese writing). I agree, not at all comparable to NYC or Chicago's Chinatown but delicious and a great inexpensive grocery store with all the specialties (just no fake purses or as big of a selection of stores)."}
{"text":"Not the best but not the worst Chinese food.

Had the Schezwan Shrimp for lunch. Egg drop soup was brought out promptly and the main course after two spoonfuls of the soup.

Soup was nothing special. Egg roll almost flavorless and mushy. No ability to substitute Lo mein for rice. Better like rice. This IS a Chinese restaurant right? 

Everything came out on same plate. Cold salad next to hot entree next to hot rice. Most places serve these separately. Obviously a move to save servers work.

Iced tea was basically water. 

Check was delivered halfway through meal. Thank you very much. You may go now."}
{"text":"Check out the Dorayaki at the Ranch Market, if you get there on time, they make a red bean paste pancake on a griddle in front of the store. Deelish! Go to the Szechwan Palace and request the non-English menu for the true authentic items. The gift shop has tons of gift ideas if you are stumped. I might also mention they have some really, really nice shrines made out of cherry wood and lacquer. I was in the market for one to make my altar and these are the real deal. Beautiful furniture finds, although they can be a bit pricey. They are willing to negotiate with you if you ask. 

The store has what you need but the variety may seem lacking in comparison to Lee Lee's or Mekong. Anything you try at the bakery is amazing, if you are in the mood for perfect deco-den like whipped cream cakes, this is the place to get it. Their fruit selection is lacking which is probably my only gripe, but they make up for it in their vegetable selection. The Chinese Herb shop next door is a great place if you are into holistic/Chinese medicine. I wish this place was bigger with more stores, that would definitely put it over the top."}
{"text":"5 stars for the fact that Phoenix even has a Chinese Cultural Center area.  The only place I've been to in it is the grocery store but one day, I plan to check-out the lil gardens and restaurants.  Can't wait until they get more in there! (Don't go expecting a big Chinatown-like scene.)

The take-out from inside the grocery store is pretty tasty, inexpensive and fast!

See ya there!"}
{"text":"We were on our way back to LA after visiting Sedona and were curious about Phoenix's Chinatown. Turns out it's not far from Sky Harbor International Airport and easy off exit #3 from eastbound 202 freeway, not far off I-10, at S. 44th St. towards Scottsdale. We noticed there were not many retail stores. In other words, there were lots of empty shop spaces. There was a restaurant, furniture, and herbs shops on the east end of the center by the parking lot. We were drawn to the market, where most people were coming and going. The pancake baker was busy at work just outside the front doors, baking both red bean and, I think, lotus seed filled, molded 3\" pancakes. Her process reminded me of aebleskiver, Danish pancake balls, only these were flat. Very soft and a great treat! We found some packaged daifuku mochi for snacking on the drive home. Very well-lit, clean, wide aisles in the store.

A well-placed sign to indicate the  location of the Koi pond and statuary would have been useful. We did not see other Yelpers' information at the time. We both would've enjoyed seeing them."}
{"text":"Not a large cultural center, but it does have several Asian shops and a large Asian gocery store."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I like coming here and going to the shops and looking at all sorts of diff things"}
{"text":"This is/was my favorite place to visit in Phoenix. Out front are historic pavilions based on those at a Chinese palace. The center has shops full of Chinese imports and at least one Chinese restaurant.
I just found out that the center has been purchased and is closed, which sounds like very bad news."}
{"text":"Really fun place to go on your lunch break.  They have plenty of dining options (some better than others), great stuff in the Ranch Market, and beautiful grounds with a koi pond and replicas of Chinese sculptures."}
{"text":"Love to come here, always a great experience & the restaurant is amazing! Our last visit was fantastic!"}
{"text":"While I'm no expert on Chinese culture, I do enjoy the cuisine. The Cofco Center is an interesting place to visit, and there is no shortage of new dishes to try at the various restaurants. The Lao Ching Hing restaurant was very good, and not difficult to get in and out of during a lunch hour. 

The Asian Seafood Buffet used to be one of the places my coworkers and I would go when we were really short on time. The food was all right, and there was a decent sushi bar in the middle. However, during our last visit we came back to our table and found a roach waiting for us. Inexpensive or not, cleanliness is a big deal."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing purely the gardens here, not the actual stores or restaurants in this shopping plaza. It's a really nice area to come and walk around, take some pictures with the family, which is exactly what I did with my parents on Christmas day when nothing else was open. 

I don't have much to say other than that it's a really scenic spot great for a casual photo session. I'll let my pictures say the rest :)"}
{"text":"Chinese themed strip mall which or local take on a china town, houses a wide range of businesses aimed at that demographic. Of note is the grocery store which is huge and has a pretty decent little restaurant in the corner. Did I mention that it was also cheap, yeah, that too."}
{"text":"I realize I'm from Houston, and I've been to San Francisco's Chinatown, but wow, this is a pretty dismal place. The cultural center is beautiful, but unfortunately, there was one grocery store, 3 restaurants, and 2 knick-knack stores (at very high prices) open. The rest of the cultural center was empty and advertising for rent space. After you eat lunch, you can cover the entire cultural center in about 5-10 minutes.

However, I think the greatest disappointment was that 2 days before Chinese New Year, the cultural center was not decorated. Furthermore, the grocery or knick knack stores had very little decorations to buy and bring home. What a disappointment, especially for the biggest holiday of the year!"}
{"text":"Bread grill pork bun, taste as good as always!"}
{"text":"If the Chinese economy has a \"hard landing,\" it will look like Cofco Cultural Center. 

Most of the storefronts are empty. There's one gift store, woefully declaring \"yes, we're open!\" There are restaurants on either side of Ranch Market that may be the same restaurant with different names. The architecture is pretty in a \"Disney does China\" way, but it's essentially a strip mall with a high vacancy rate, anchored by a supermarket."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place is on a downward trajectory it appears. Many businesses have closed and there are many vacancies. The ones that are there, apart from the Asian Market have changed hands. Not bad, but not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"Having a Filipino wife means lots of trips to the Asian store located here. The place looks grate. Like a little slice of china. The Asian shipping store usually sales many much of whats needed for my wifes Filipino dishes. As well some hard to find items for chief's. Like frog legs. 

There are two restraints.  Here one has sone great food. The other is like any other Chinese restaurant. There are a few trinket stores. But other then that, the place has a lot of empty store fronts. So it kinda has a ghost town feel to it.

The parking lot and surrounding area is kept very clean. 

Simply put - The place is nice,  but has a lot of unused potential."}
{"text":"This was a beautiful place to visit. It's free and would be fun for the family. You don't see what's in the back behind the 44th street view. There are restaurants, shops and a grocery store. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. Parking lot in the back."}
{"text":"The Chinese Cultural Center was a great distraction from a busy Phoenix day.  There was plenty of parking and getting there is easy off the 202. The center has several shops that sell furniture and accessories, herbs, apparel, etc. There are several places to eat.  We ate at the Golden Buddha - very beautiful inside with an aquarium and attractive seating area. Good food, but be ready to deal with ordering some stuff you may not understand at first. After lunch we went to the food market.  Really cool to walk around and see all the different stuff.  You definitely won't see these ingredients down at the local super market.  You are guaranteed to have a good time looking around. Have fun!"}
{"text":"It's unique and it's in Phoenix, for that alone it gets 5 stars.  This is a fun place to kill a couple of hours with out of town visitors or on a date.  Stroll through the gardens. Wander through the grocery store, (yes it stinks but it's part of the ambiance) and look a all the strange and gross foods. Try one of the restaurants, but not Quizno's that doesn't count.  Check out the curio shops for some odd trinket to take home with you."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just me but this place was a bit of a let down.

The bakery was passable and I found the food selection to be inferior to Mekong, Lee Lee's, and Asiana Market in Mesa and Tempe.

The Chinese Culture part is a bit of joke really, if culture can be absorbed by walking through oriental themed buildings and the grocery. 

One could glean more Chinese Culture in Chandler imo"}
{"text":"It has gotten a lot worse over the years due to the economy.  The huge dim-sum restaurant that was there with visits from celebrities such as Jackie Chan has been closed for a couple of years now.  All you see is the huge Buddha statue sitting in the window looking out to the Chinese courtyard still filled with Koi fish and warrior stone statues.  There is one surviving Chinese restaurant that serve Szechwan food, a Ranch Market for food, and small Asian souvenir shop.  The place really looks abandoned in the middle of Arizona with surrounding nonAsian population.  It is said that those that once did business here now left because Asians in AZ just felt it too far to travel to this one location.  I'm just glad I got a chance to see it."}
{"text":"I went in on Friday, 8/11 to the Super L market to buy some lottery tickets (don't judge!) and their machines have been removed because the market is set to close on Saturday, 8/26 and relocating to Thomas and Hayden in Scottsdale.  This is the anchor of the complex that kept it relevant among the many vacancies.

Edit: There is a news article about the center now.

{"text":"Always a fun visit....typically for the Lunar New Year celebration, but also for the Full Moon festival in Autumn any time is good to visit...great year round shopping and Asian market."}
{"text":"This place is essentially a strip mall, but offers more than the usual strip mall options. The biggest attraction is its architecture, as its designed with  traditional Chinese architecture. The top floors hold office space, the bottom retail and restaurant space. Facing 44th Street is a beautiful garden. There's a large goldfish pond on the south side,with small bridges and walkways over and around it. There are numerous statues and pagodas along the south and east side of the building. It's a beautiful and relaxing addition to the city. There is a large store that sells Asian goods, namely furniture and decorative items. The owners are very nice and friendly. There is also a bridal gown shop and Asian video store next to it. Ranch Market owns a large grocery store that sells Asian foods, though in my opinion LeeLee Market in Chandler has a better selection. There are several restaurants and a coffee shop as well. The Golden Buddha is excellent and the wait staff moves fast. During the day, you can order dim sum from carts the wait staff pushes around the dining floor. The food is excellent and you may be able to get a seat overlooking the aforementioned goldfish pond. It's definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Great beautiful place to visit. Lots of yummy food choices and great scenery. The manager Patrick is super nice and does a wonderful job!"}
{"text":"I've never been to China, but this is close as I've come.  The buildings have Chinese style architecture and there is a large pond with fish in it.  Fun place to come and take pics and walk around."}
{"text":"My husband was born and raised as a British Expat in Hong Kong and loves the Chinese Cultural Center for its authenticity. There are some great, inexpensive and authentic restaurants there serving a wide variety of Chinese foods. There is a place called the Seafood Buffet on the west end of the plaza and the food there is fantastic and lunch during the week is around $7. Golden Buddha (next to the amazing wedding shop) has an inexpensive lunch menu and I've heard the Dim Sum is incredible. 

The grocery store in that plaza has tons of authentic Asian foods that you won't be able to find anywhere else. Just the smell of the different foods and spices takes me back to my last trip to Hong Kong and really adds to the experience. I don't know what half the stuff there is, but if you wander through the candy aisle you should pick up a few random pieces and just try something different. 

The Center has a festival around the Chinese New Year  where they have street vendors selling all kinds of goodies including a huge selection of decorative Koi fish and various cultural performances. It's really a unique place, especially here in Phoenix, and is worth an afternoon visit if you're looking for something different."}
{"text":"I drove a Chinese friend to medical appt last Monday, Sept 18, 2017, took 5 hours out of my day, when it was supposed to be 40 min.  On the way back she treated me to lunch special Beijing restaurant at Chinese Cultural Center, but while we were still driving down 44 St toward the shopping center,I told her \"COFCO center has BAD FENG SHUI!!!\"   She is a real estate agent and told me she KNEW it would be bad when they first built Cofco 20 years ago.  No business lasts long there.

Well, when I turned into the  COFCO shopping center, I was so shocked!!!  The parking lot WAS EMPTY!  And the Ranch market's sign on building was gone, just a \"shadow\" of the lettering that was no more .  There were only 4 tenants left at most, Szechuan Palace, Beijing, some non-public office, and something else.  The East wing was entirely vacant and they were remodeling it.  I thought they were remodeling it to \"change the feng shui to be better\".

The owner of the Beijing place told us Ranch Market moved REAL FAST!!!!!

  He did not know the reason, nor did he seem to care.  He said his business at his restaurant was good enough to stay there.  He said he heard Ranch Market moved to Scottsdale.  I said Scottsdale is 34 miles long, where?  He did not know.

When I got home I Yelped Super L Ranch Market and saw that they had already changed their address on Yelp.  It is right next to my other favorite store I go to 2 x a week - 99 Cents Store, ONLY TWO MILES FROM WHERE I LIVE.!  I was so excited!  I called them there.  Lady answered and told me this sad story.  She said their lease was expiring and new landlord (True North Companies, LLC) said they were not renewing the lease and gave them only 30 days to pack up and get out!  New Landlord told them if they did not leave at the end of the 30 days, LANDLORD WOULD LOCK THEM OUT OF THEIR STORE.  So ....\"they moved real fast!\" ...said the Beijing owner.

Poor Ranch Market could not find a vacant space BIG ENOUGH to hold their store in 30 days, so they ended up at the old Fresh and Easy location at SW corner Thomas and Hayden, next to 99 Cents Store, only 2 miles from where I live.  Good for me I guess, but I went there Saturday, the day after they first opened. Employee said the sq. ft was only 1/3 of the COFCO location.  I think it looks more like 1/5th!  No one inside the store except a few employees.  Worker there told me they have so many refrigeration cases that they could not move to Fresh and Easy , and that they had orders and orders for new groceries to be shipped and delivered to the Cultural Center location, that kept coming and coming, and they had so much to do .  \"STOP THE SHIPMENTS STOP STOP! \"

I think new landlord True North was \"mean\" to Super L.  When landlord of Scottsdale Pavillions on Indian Bend did not want to renew lease for my favorite Chinese buffet Oriental Garden, that landlord gave OG 6 months notice.  Sadly OG moved to new building in Peoria and in 2 years went out of business.  

Here are some links to what happened.  55 employees had to be laid off.

http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/08/20/phoenix-chinese-cultural-center-hundreds-protest-sale-and-possible-renovation/584970001/

I feel sad for Ranch Market, but I lived in my area for 22 years.  I tell people I have everything I want within 3 miles of my house.  Lowes, HD, Scottsdale Community College,  Sprouts, mall, casino buffets, Main library, nice greenbelt, lake, two 99 Cents stores, Dollar Tree, BUT one thing I did not have close was Chinese grocery store.  Now I  have that right next to my beloved 99 Cents store where I buy most all my produce, wow! 

 But I feel MORE SAD for Super L Ranch Market forced to pay cost to move and downsize employees and space so drastically, THAN I am happy I have Chinese grocery store only 2 miles away from my house.  I felt the new Hope you live close enough to support Super L at their new location at Thomas and Hayden."}
{"text":"This place is full of culture, even though it is very small.  It has several little gift shops, Asian restaurants, a Asian grocery store and a beautiful back area with a koi fish pond with statues and beautiful architecture.  When there is a festival, they really make the place look nice.  I recommend going to the Chinese New Year Festivals that happen during the month of February.  It's a free festival, but parking usually cost money.  I honestly park across the street and walk over to the festival.  

If you are a teacher, you can take your children to the Chinese Festival during the day!  They have performances with dragon dances, karate, tai chi, and dances.  They also have several stands for kids to get their name in caligraphy, orgami, and places to do mah jong.  

The main place I like to go there is the gift shop and the grocery market.  The grocery market, in my opinion, has the best sales compared to other Asian markets in AZ.  The gift shop is great when I want to get my non-Asian friends a Asian trinket or item I think they would enjoy."}
{"text":"I like that there are a few restaurants in this center. And one in the Market too, which a while ago changed ownership to the store (vs. 3rd party vendor). The food choices got slim, and were less fresh, but they seem to have that all fixed as of recently.  So I am going there almost weekly again."}
