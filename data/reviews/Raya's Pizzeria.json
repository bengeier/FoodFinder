{"text":"It's just ok basic pizza. If you want a good pizza there is a couple of other spots close by that are better"}
{"text":"I could find nothing good about this pie.  It is along the lines of a Papa Johns type pizza but not as good as one.  It is a shame that people put this type of product forward.  Pizza is so easy to make.  You start with a good dough, add some good sauce, and top it with great cheese.  It is that simple.  This pizza has the lowest quality ingredients at every step of the process- bad cheese, bad sauce, bad crust.  The problem with using the cheapest products is that you end up with crap.  I used to eat DiGiorno's when it first came out.  I can honestly say that DiGiorno's was better than this pizza."}
{"text":"Went in there because a friend told me to try it since it's under new ownership. Guys there were friendly and professional. Steak sub was amazing to say the least and the pizza was also perfect. Defiantly will order again. Also probably the cleanest pizza shop I've ever seen. Great service."}
{"text":"People, I know it says \"pizza\" on the sign outside, but on the menu it says, \"gyro\". Pay special attention to this.  I've had their pizza, and it's pretty good, but it's not why they are getting five stars. They make fantastic steak subs. Also not the reason. They've got service down to a simple science. Not it. The place is clean, understated, and local. Nope, nope, nope.  Warm, doughy pita bread. Check. Fresh iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and onion. Check. Tart, creamy cucumber sauce. Check. Best gyro lamb in Pittsburgh. CHECK.  Forget Mike & Tony's. Order the lamb gyro from Raya's and never look back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local pizzeria. In downtown Carnegie, this is a great place to order from on a Friday night. I wouldn't recommend actually eating in the restaurant, as the seating and atmosphere isn't great (think clinical) which is why I generally limit this to take-out or delivery only. (Truthfully, I think they prefer this.)  The pizza itself is delicious. I am not a crust eater, but I will eat theirs. They also do not skimp on the toppings, so while you can certainly order the same sized pizza for less money, you don't know how much cheese or pepperoni is going to be on there. For me, being able to see through the cheese is a dealbreaker.   Because they are a bit in the pricier side as far as pizza goes, look on Facebook for coupons. Even if they're expired, they still honor them."}
{"text":"This review is for the gyro only. The gyro here was perfectly acceptable and on the better end of average. The pita was chewy and soft with crispy edges. The meat was juicy and crunchy with plenty of flavor. The sauce is everything I wanted from a taziki. The produce was fine. A pretty decent gyro."}
{"text":"My go to pizza place in Carnegie! Delicious and a lot of specialty options to choose from. Try their gyros too they are delicious!"}
{"text":"First impression is this place is very clean and has an organized view of the kitchen. The pizza is pretty good and they have a comprehensive menu."}
{"text":"Awful pizza! I got 2 plain pieces. It just didn't have any flavor tasted like cardboard. The only thing I can say is the slices were big. Maybe the gyros would be better. But I don't recommend the pizza AT ALL!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!!!  The sauce they use on it makes it great!  Not a fan of the wings.  But, they also gave me all pepperoni (I ordered half cheese, half pepperoni).  With this high rating you can tell how much I liked the pizza with all the other problems."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! This place used to be on the bottom of my list, but since the new owners have taken over, the food is really good! Stopped in and ordered to carry out. Staff was friendly & quick. A pizza & hoagie took a little over 10 minutes.  I was impressed and will certainly order again!"}
{"text":"For the most part I don't take a lot of time considering pizza because, as far as I am concerned, all pizza is good. That said, Raya's deserves a special mention....it is AWESOME. Their pizza is some of the best I have ever had. My husband is a huge fan of the steak ranchero pizza, but as far as I can tell you can't go wrong with any of their pizzas. If you are in the area and want pizza this is by far the place to go!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the new(er) management/owners are way more friendly. I previously stopped ordering from then because the staff was extremely rude, but they are completely different now and much more welcoming.  The pizza is probably my favorite in the area and the hoagies are great too. This isn't a wing shop, so the flavors aren't that broad, but the mild we're pretty good."}
{"text":"I ate there a few months ago on a Sunday evening, they sold me some burned chicken tenders. Never Again !!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza shop with selection of hoagies and sides as well. My office was down the street and we often ordered from here for employee functions. Orders arrived at the times requested; often ordering 15 larger pies or more. If you're in the Carnegie area it's an ok place for delivery."}
