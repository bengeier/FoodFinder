{"text":"Great pitchers of magaritas and sangria.  Huge patio. Staff is friendly and competent.  Food is ok but not great."}
{"text":"Macho - the best thing about this restaurant is their guacamole. Tacos are solid, but it took us 45 minutes to receive our fajitas. We ended up paying our bill and not being able to enjoy these.  The positive thing was the manager came out and offered us a shot / drink. Ill give them another chance in the future!"}
{"text":"Nothing special at all. Very bland and overpriced food. Lots of much much better Mexican in the city. Wouldn't bother!"}
{"text":"Okay so when we went they may have underestimated how many people were going to stop by or maybe it had something to do with the fact that they had only been open for a few weeks but the first thing they told us is that despite our reservation we would have to wait fifteen minutes which I think means they didn't quite understand how reservations work. To be fair it was the day the Blue Jays went 18 innings with Cleveland so they maybe more people stayed than was normal. That being said once we got in and once they figured out who was serving us (again, think they were still getting their sea legs) things got better as the food was fantastic. 
I had the Southern Smoked Short Rib which was great and my girlfriend had various tacos (can't remember which specifically) and all of it was delicious. I can't remember what our friends had but it was also tasty. The desserts were also great (although we all agreed the flourless cheesecake was just okay). We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Its a hit or miss here... Sometimes service is incredible but half the time we were ignored for more than 10 mins... Food is always great! Mondy specils is fajitas and they re amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for Taco Tuesday! And while the deal was great (3 tacos for $10), the same can't be said for all the tacos. I personally, had the basa, pork belly, and beef brisket; ranked from best to least imo.

The beef brisket in particular was very underwhelming as it lacked any and all flavour to which one would enjoy.

In addition to this, we had the macho fries (with Chorizo), which were excellent, and well received from our entire table. 

They also had some drink specials ($5 tequila) or $6 tequila of the day, and that was a fun way to kick off the evening.

Overall, it was a good experience, that could have been better had the service been a bit more prompt. They appeared understaffed from the onset, but it was really telling after we received our bills and then subsequently had to wait quite some time for another waiter (not even our own) to come hand us the machine to pay. The staff was friendly, but just not enough to handle the volume of customers."}
{"text":"I went there the first week it opened and right away I can tell it was knew by the poor service.
Food was great.
Must order Guac!!
Had the chili chicken taco - super tasty.  
Also had the flatbread - original and tasty
Overall, I would go back and try other menu items
I blame the service quality on the mere fact that it's super new and they are getting used to it."}
{"text":"Space is great with nice music but kind of loud for my taste. Food is ok for a Mexican place but the attention was poor."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on her recommendation.  I'm so glad we did.  It was a Tuesday evening at dinner time and it wasn't too crowded.  We ordered the Fajita special -- it was delicious.  Note: it's not standard fajitas - the veggies come stir fried, but the chicken breast is cooked separately, sliced up (but still whole) and then served with sauce.  Different but delicious!  It's not a huge serving but perfect for the mid-sized eater.  The restaurant is very clean and has a lovely covered patio - just right for a hot summer's dinner.  And I loved their frozen margarita's - reminiscent of the ones we enjoy in Puerto Vallarta.   I have to note the service from Alex - he was amazing.  Attentive - but not that \"in your face\" attentive!, quick and very nice.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Tagline: Macho Radio Bar -- Needs to buff up.
2.5 stars

We decided to visit Macho Radio Bar for my friend's birthday celebration on a Saturday evening. It was around 6 or 7pm, and the wait staff was very apologetic that we would have to sit inside (as opposed to the patio). No big deal!

However...

Restaurant size:
CRAMPED. The four of us were seated at one of those higher bar tables where if you fell off your stool it wouldn't be pretty. The tables are way too small to comfortably contain all 4 of our massive serving dishes, drinks and cutlery bin. Also, it would have been a more comfortable idea to have foot rests near the base of the table, rather than just on the stools. While eating, I can only mimic being proper or riding a motorcycle for so long. I felt really bad when the servers and other patrons kept bumping/grazing their butts and chests into my arm/elbow. 

There is a larger bar area, and even some tables with couch-like seats.
The patio looks pretty spacious.


Food quality:
Disappointingly un-macho. 
All 4 of us ordered fajitas, which gives you 3 small soft-taco shells to build your meal with. Some of these mini tortillas will be stale and slightly discoloured. 

The steak was nice and tender, and the slow-cooked rib was very fall-off-the-bone; flavours were OK.

We also ordered nachos. Go to Sneaky Dee's for nachos. 

Have you ever had margaritas in the States? you know how the cup is massive and you get a lot of booze? Not here. Also un-macho.

Garland everywhere. Everything has garland on it. Everywhere.
Much green.


Service:
We had a wonderful server who really took care of us. I let him know that it was my friend's birthday and he made sure to surprise my friend with a complimentary birthday dessert. The staff are conscious about the minimal amount of space available and will try to clear your plates as soon as they can, when they see that it's empty. They'll also try to top you up with more napkins without you asking; quite appreciated. 


Final thoughts:
If you're looking for Mexican-inspired fare which is filling and is reasonably priced, you should consider elsewhere. If you're looking for large margaritas you should also look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome service. Great vibe and the patio is fantastic. I had the fish taco and nachos and guacamole. Really good and done right. Not like other \"Tex mex\" places. Can't wait to try out their brunch!"}
{"text":"Tonight five of us walked into the bar and we're greeted with no hostess/host. Only three tables were occupied at this time. After a few minutes, a bartender came by and offered to clean off a table for us. Over the course of five hours, we had four different servers. They were hard to find. Every single time we had to track them down, we never once had someone come to check in or see if we needed something. I am not picky but I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican at its finest. Met a friend here on a Tuesday evening, it wasn't busy so I was seated right away while I waited. Servers seemed friendly enough, though she got water for the tables seated after me first, it wasn't until I flagged down a hostess that I got water. We got drinks, I ordered a margarita, I wish I had paid more attention because I ordered the one that was 20$! My fault, not theirs. It was tasty but for 3/4 cup of liquid it was nowhere near worth 20$. 
My biggest issue was the food. It was terrible. Extremely bland. We spilt some guac and pico. The chips were under seasoned and the pico was basically large chunks of tomato and onion placed on top of the guac, sadly that was the highlight of the meal. I got the fajitas, came with 4 taco shells (they are the flavourless kind most restaurants in Toronto use). The fajitas were pretty meh. Tiny piece of steak and overwhelmed by red and green peppers. I asked for actual hot sauce, not the sweet orangey stuff they give and was told it would be 2$ extra. Any other place I've been to just give real, actually spicy hot sauce, no charge. My friend got 3 tacos - pork belly, fish and corn fritter- as there are only 5 taco options?. She said they were terrible but begrudging ate them because she paid for them. 
All in all your better off at any other Mexican place in the city. Save your money, this place is a let down."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio and great staff. I had heard about this place a few times and decided to finally check it out. I'm glad I did. 

I ordered the fish tacos followed by some pork belly and they were both excellent. It's definitely worth checking out and highly recommended."}
{"text":"So disappointing - asked the hostess how long the wait would be on a clearly busy night.  Was told no more than 30 minutes and that they would call when the table was ready .   Went for a coffee nearby and gave up after an hour.   Never got a call or text.   Pretty crummy service.  

Although looking at the other reviews on here, not sure we missed much."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to agree with some of the lackluster reviews. 

I came here with a friend the other day. We had guac and chips and tacos. The guac, as another reviewer mentioned, was such a disappointment. It barely tasted like avocados. It was so thin and was more like chopped tomatoes and onions on top of a very thin, tasteless schmear of avocado. I tasted no lime, no cilantro. No seasoning, really. And they do honestly give you the smallest amount. It's like they're cheaping out on the preparation and the portion. Just pitiful for a Mexican place. The guacamole should be awesome and plentiful.

The tacos were doll-sized. Seriously. We each ordered three, and my friend who has the smallest appetite of anyone I know promptly said, \"We need to order more food.\" The tacos were maybe three inches across (prefolding!) and the toppings were skimpy. The pork belly had great flavour and crispness. The pork shoulder was dry and ropy. The chicken was okay. 

We ordered the churros and they were undoubtedly the best part of the meal. Small in size, but fresh and yummy.

I probably wouldn't come here again. We both left not quite satiated. The value for money just isn't here and the quality is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food! 

Michael, the manager, truly cares for every customer that comes through. He is very hands on and takes time to get to know the customers. Service in general is very attentive. The staff does explain the menu in detail if you've never been there before. 

There is an extensive drinks menu, in addition to the main menu. Their frozen margaritas are quite strong, which is always a good thing. We also tried out their shots of grenadine and frozen margarita mix (forgot what they were called). Good way to start (or end) your meal but just be careful for the potential of brain freeze ;) 

The nachos are honestly amazing - huge portions. If you split between two people, you can just order an additional 1-2 tacos per person and you'll be more than full. Their quinoa and kale salad is fresh and refreshing after a heavy dose of nachos. Everything comes to the table piping hot. Their dark chocolate churros are fresh and taste amazing as well (didn't try the two other flavours available). 

All in all, good experience - would come back!"}
{"text":"Cute spot! The patio is perfect for patio summer, very comfortable and nicely decorated. I know it's advertised as \"Tex Mex\", but I guess I was expecting a few more traditional Mexican options. However the food was still good!

Tacos are pretty small but packed with flavor. Definitely recommend the fish and buffalo cauliflower tacos over the chicken, just more flavorful. I recommend for small apps or tacos, maybe not a full dinner. Will be back often this summer for drinks and small bites."}
{"text":"I had the nacho and cheese fondue. My lord the fondue was way too salty. 
I do like the atmosphere. Very nice location to being friends on a evening out. Try to get the outside patio if you can. In the fall they try to have heaters to make it bearable to sit outside."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. The atmosphere is great, laid back, loud music with a great vibes. I love the bar set up, very visually appealing. This place is great for groups and they have board games 

The staff, amazing hands down. Extremely welcoming and helpful. I would honestly return just because their staff is just that awesome.

I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict and it came with these potato taters... they were so good. The even have a decent hot sauce which of course is a bonus."}
{"text":"popped in here after a night out in Toronto! 

my boyfriend has walked by it while working and saved it. I didn't even know this area had developed as much as it did.

we sat on their patio and it was so super comfortable. we were served right away, we asked so many questions and the server had all the answers (I really really appreciated that).

we started with an order of all non-vegetarian options, my favourite by far was the fish tacos (they were so good we ordered a second round). 

the pork belly came second, first time trying it and I was impressed 

the chicken and pulled pork were good, but not as amazing as the fish. 

I would definitely come check this place out again on a Friday or Saturday, it's got a wonderful ambiance and I find that it would be \"happening\" on the weekend."}
{"text":"Went to Macho last night for my boyfriends birthday. We had gone the week before to test out the food and see if we liked the vibe. Round one wasn't terrible. We sat outside and the food was quite good. We decided to make a reservation while we were there for the following Friday. We spoke to the host and explained that we would be a group of about 15 and that we would like a booth, outside, on the terrace. She punched in our reservation and we went on our way. Fast forward to last night, we get to the restaurant and they have us at a table inside. When I asked the host why we had been seated inside as we had deliberately made a reservation outside, she said (very flippantly) that they don't take reservations for big groups outside. Extremely irritated, I asked to please speak with a manager. The manager came out and was quite apologetic but explained that no, they unfortunately don't take reservations for large groups outside. When I pointed out that the hostess had never once mentioned that, he apologized and said he would  let her know so that she doesn't make that mistake in the future. My boyfriend wasn't too phased by it though so we decided to stay and try to enjoy our evening. About 30 mins after my interaction with the manager, it started to rain and all the people who were sitting outside, came in. The manager proceeds to come over to my table and say \"do you know how valuable this table that your at, is right now? You should thank your boyfriend for being ok with sitting inside\" and points outside to the rain with a smug grin (as if the fact that it just so-happened to rain, meant I wasn't justified in being upset that they  didn't honour our original reservation). Then, our waiter. Literally, THE most incompetent waiter I have EVER had and the attitude on this guy was incredible. He never once smiled, any time he would interact with my group he was rude, short, and impatient. He fucked up multiple people's orders... and I can appreciate that we were a large group. It's completely understandable that a few things got messed up but this guy would drop the ball and when we would point It out, he would be completely unapologetic and shrug his shoulders. Finally, the cherry on top. When I went to track down the waiter to order a birthday desert for my boyfriend he was like \"ok, you could do cheese cake\" I asked if there were any other options so we went over to the computer and he listed off the different deserts and I ended up picking the churros. I asked if he could put a candle in them somehow and he said yea, that they could just melt the wax on to the plate. I said perfect and He said it would take about 15 minutes for them to come out. I went back to my seat and, after about 30 mins, I flagged him down to ask if he knew roughly when the churros would be out. He gave me this confused look and said \"what churros\"? I initially laughed because I thought he was joking but he kept looking at me like I had six heads. He was like \"you didn't order them from me right?\" I reminded him of our 5 minute long conversation about the birthday desert, literally 30 mins prior. He thought about it....and then thought about it some more......and then a light bulb went off and he was like \"oh, yea I think those went to a table over there\". He goes \"I can put in another order for you but, oh yea btw we don't have candles either\" Fuming at this point I told him not to bother. 


If I'm being fair, the food and the drinks are decent 3.5/5, but the service/ambiance was so dismal that I would never recommend going there."}
{"text":"I was there last night with some friends who live in one of the nearby condos. We were happy to sit outside until it started raining, so we were forced to sit inside.

Though it's a nice looking restaurant, it was hot, sweaty, and uncomfortable. We were all sitting there on hard stools and high tables sweating like crazy. Also for all the dishes the four of us ordered, the tables were just not large enough.

The food itself was not bad, I was stuffed after 5 tacos. I ordered the corn quinoa fritter, chili chicken, and pork belly. I love fish tacos and wanted to try their basa but they were all sold out at 9pm. Even all their Sunday specials were sold out...

Our waiter was a nice guy, and even though he mixed up our order, he brought us 4 free tequila shots which was a nice gesture. The drinks were all watered down though, even their sangria tasted like fruit juice.

A big plus is that their washrooms are very clean, and the staff is really nice. They clearly have to work on some improvements, but I think they can do well if they changed the management."}
{"text":"What a great spot! Pinball machines, a cool display of classic Vinyl on the wall, the staff in there are all wearing their favorite band t-shirts while there is some great music playing through the sound system. 

A cozy patio for the summer days, and lots of seating at the bar!

An amazing selection of tequila to choose from, and of course, the food. Amazing! The pork belly tacos were my favorite! Fresh ingredients always do the talking!

Well done Macho! We will be back, and will recommend to our friends, to pay you guys a visit!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Okay, this is my new fave restaurant in this area. If you compare it to Hunter's Landing next door, which is absolutely horrid, this is the place to be! I am a hard food critic, and this place is great! I'm gonna review in sequences, so first, service:
-New place, so give them a break. We have been twice so far, and sat both outside on the patio and at the bar. We liked that they had waitresses of all sizes, races and ages. Outside: our waitress was inexperienced, and slow. However, halfway through our dinner our waitress was inexplicably replaced by a more experienced server. They took our orders slower than expected but they also didn't rush us out. Calm down. You want to be turned over as soon as you finish your bite? Inside: we sat at the bar because the place was packed and we didn't want to wait for a table. The service was 300% faster. The bartender was incredibly friendly. Big TV's inside so we could watch the game. They had 2 games on, so if you are a sports fan and the game is on, go inside! I think they have a couple TV's outside, but it's so packed, you might not be able to watch comfortably. 
Food: so far we've ordered:
Mini Tostadas: overpriced at $9 for 3 mini tostatdas, HOWEVER this dish is what got me to return the 2nd time. If you like ceviche, this is your dig. It was hands down the best ceviche I have ever had. FRESH. FRESH. FRESH. The 2nd time, The tostada itself wasn't as salty or was altered (did you deep fry it?? Why??) and we were both disappointed a bit as we both noticed. However, I would still order this again. It is FUCKEN GOOD! Fix it back to the beginning. 
Chili Chicken Taco: BLAND. DO NOT ORDER. Remove this from your menu unless you add some spice. It does not have anything worth ordering. The flour tortilla fell apart and we both hated it. It was borderline gross. We thought the pineapple would match with the chicken. However, the chicken was flavourless and everything added (everything on top was bland and gross) drummed it out. It needed a spicy pepper harder than a jalepenos to become re-orderable. The chicken wasn't properly spiced either. 
Pork Shoulder Taco: Very Good. Not our favourite, but nice. 
Beer Battered Basa Taco: Okay, so this is why we will be back also. It is absolutely amazing. We over ordered this instead of dessert on our 2nd visit because it was just that good. Don't order this because I will be pissed if they run out and I'm going. This is hands down one of their best menu items. 
Pork Belly Taco: Our 2nd favourite. It's devine. The flavour balance is amazing. They do a good job with this hard dish. It's worth a 45 min drive, haaahha not us but still. 
Milk Chocolate Churros: We did the 3 for $5 the first time and let me tell you the only reason why we didn't repeat this 2nd time was that we were simply stuffed. This is absolutely decadent. We love this. It was hot and FRESH. I complained all night that we should have gotten this to go. Relationship problems. LOL.
We have only ever had classic margaritas here and I am a stuck up margarita drinker. IT IS WORTH COMING HERE JUST FOR THIS DRINK. Right amount of mix, right amount of salt and right amount of booze!!!! I ABSOLUTELY love this margarita. So far, unless you are overseas in a tropical place that has top shelf 5 stars you will not see it mixed this way. If you ever make this not as good, I will never come back. 

WHERE IS YOUR BEEF TACO??????????????? Do it GOOD and you will be invincible. 

You are welcome, Macho, but I hope this doesn't increase your business as I am in the condo's next door and you are MY place! Take the chicken off your menu or fix it!!!!! YUCK"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night around 10 pm, their patio is so gorgeous and romantic! It had fairy lights and we got a nice corner seat with a comfy couch. We got the macho fries and 3 tacos, the tacos were 3 for $10 which is nice considering they are normally $5 each. We got the basa fish and the corn fritter, both were really good, I think the portion is a bit small though. The fries were so fresh, flavourful and cheesy! The cilantro really made it the only thing was the cheese was melted on this black paper which kept ripping as we were trying to eat. The servers were super nice and I asked one of them about a non-alcoholic drink and another girl came by later recommending some which was nice that they communicated. I ended up getting coke that was imported from Mexico and made with cane sugar ($4) which was pretty good. Overall for 2 people we were't that full but I think we got mainly snacks, our bill came up to under $30."}
{"text":"I recently visited macho with a few friends. We happened to stop in just as the jays game was getting out. It was very busy inside and out but our service and food were amazing! The food selection is great for sharing with a small or big group. And if you like tequila this is definitely a place to visit. They have many selections with very reaspnable prices.The decor is also great! It is very modern and spacious inside and out! It is a must visit place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"To feed the brunch obsession, a group of us headed to Macho Tex Mex. Luckily, we made a reservation as it was packed! Our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived, but that was understandable once we saw how busy it was; it is a popular spot for large groups. Lots of large tables, high ceilings with equally giant windows, it is a welcoming spot for brunch....and bottomless mimosas.  

Did you just say bottomless mimosas?! I did! 

Choose your dish from the brunch menu and all for $29, the bottomless mimosas will flow! They've got a few different juice flavours to choose from: orange, grapefruit, raspberry and more. I, of course, ordered Eggs Benny($14), because I have issues. The other photo is the Big Breakfast($13). The metal plate was an unusual way to serve food. Presentation is clearly not their focus. The food was average. I couldn't stop eating the fried potatoes. I ate mine and anyone who left some on their plate. I definitely stole someone's bacon. No regrets. I was stuffed!  

The service was great. They were a good team! They kept our champagne on ice and the juice flowing.  I'm not sure if I needed a nap after because ate too much or had too many mimosas. I was happy either way!"}
{"text":"a random walk by sighting of a drink I wanted in my hand promoted me to walk onto their patio on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Service was warm and friendly. Big comfy couches and good tunes. Drink list was what my dreams are made of; I wanted it all. Frozen margarita was a good call. Tacos were awful, edible but painfully disappointing. I left our server know and the manager brought us an ice cream sandwich on the house, and it was good and the gesture was nice. I'd be back to give them another shot and hope they get their food act together"}
{"text":"Service here was very good, we stopped by on a weeknight and it was fairly empty (around 7pm) and we got our food fairly quickly. Staff was polite and there were no issues there.

I wasn't too impressed with the food though. I would say it was mediocre - nothing to write home about, and I wouldn't go back here just for the food. I tried the Tacos, which were good, but again, not the best Tacos i've had. I believe they have special one day of the week for $10 for 2 tacos I think.. but don't quote me on this!

Overall good atmosphere, so-so food, high prices.."}
{"text":"Bottomless boozy mimosa Sunday brunches. Yup, you heard me correctly. I almost wish I didn't know about their $29 bottomless mimosa brunches which include a meal, because I now expect to spend my foreseeable Sundays here. 

Sometimes it can get really busy so reservations recommended if you're part of a bigger group. They have a really nice patio section as well. Staff are pretty attentive here and keep the bubbly flowing non-stop. Bottomless truly means bottomless here - they'll let you drink from 11am - 3pm and they have a few selections of juices to add to your sparkling wine. They also have $20 sangria pitchers. 

It's the perfect spot to spend a lazy Sunday."}
{"text":"Though we had heard from friends that the reviews were not good at all, we decided to go out on a limb and try Macho Radio Bar.  I am so glad that we did!

We walked over, which was awesome and were then seated on the lovely patio.  Our server came to the table and was helpful and informative right from the get go.  HIs name is Cody and he was amazing!  He went over the menu with us, offering some great tips and recommendations for us.

We shared guacamole and chips to start.  The guac was very good, the chips were excellent!  I then had fish tacos, one of my favs.  They did not disappoint.  My partner had the beef short rib fajita, the meat literally fell off the bone.  Another hit.

My frozen margarita tasted like 10 more!!!  However, I am saving that for another day this summer since we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came by with some friends on a night of downtown exploration and ended up here late in the evening. They offered us the late night menu and we got right down to business.

The bar was quite small inside, with lots of tables put in, but it surprisingly didn't seem overcrowded. It felt very welcoming!

It was a little surprising that they didn't offer tacos on the late night menu, but they had some awesome treats on there. We went for the Guacamole & Salsa, Mex and Tex Flatbread, and the Mini Tostadas. The guac/salsa was absolutely amazing, lots of flavor and the chips were amazing on their own too. The flatbreads both had their own unique taste, with the Tex a little better in my opinion. The Mex was just missing a little depth of flavor, even though it had the chorizo. The Mini Tostadas were okay, but cilantro and lime on it was just too overpowering.

For drinks, we decided to share a pitcher of the El Diablo, which was AMAZING! A great drink to share over, and it came in beautiful glasses/pitcher. Service was very good, very quick, friendly, and a wonderful smile.

Definitely recommend checking Macho out, and I will be coming again to partake in their regular menu!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing evening at Macho! The atmosphere and food were great, as always, but the staff made it extraordinary this time. Veronica and Leah were fun and friendly, and together they made the night extra special. Now I'm going to have my birthday here!"}
{"text":"First off: I like how they put 'tex mex' in their name as many try to pass themselves off as Mexican when they aren't. I also enjoyed my time here being with good company.

The place was packed out for brunch, in no small part I'm sure to the unlimited Mimosas special. I personally didn't opt for that, but I thought it was practical how they simply provided various juices and sparkling white wine which allowed people to pour their own. I'm sure they would've been more overwhelmed had they needed to make and bring out individual mimosas when they were AYCD.

We had a great server, but with that said, I don't think they put out enough. There was often a long wait and my food came out cold (more below). I'm also not too sure why they have mostly high tables. Does it fit more people? Is it trendier? In any case, for me, it's not that comfortable.

I ordered the Huevos Racheros and they disappointed in terms of: size, value and taste. Effectively, it was just two smaller sized (wheat - not corn) tortillas with a bit of egg (I chose scrambled), some pickled onions, salsa and some avocado. It came with home fries. I also ordered chorizo. I had hoped the chorizo would be the looser, not in casing type, which would've lended itself better IMO. In all fairness, they didn't claim it would be that way, but it was still disappointing paying $4 for one 3\" chorizo sausage - which was overcooked. The rest was okay, probably a 3 star plate, but the room temperature egg brought it down.

It wasn't bad, but wasn't great either  -and of all meals, you should leave a brunch feeling full which I didn't."}
{"text":"I love me some tacos, but these are not it for me.

Pros: Great patio, great space for a summer's day; They aren't lacking on number of servers and they are fairly attentive. Limes for each serving.

Cons: The food. It's really meh. Not authentic mexican and not tex mex. Like an upscale tex mex without any of the unique flavours or ingredients to justify the price.
Serving sizes are just too small. Mains come out before starters. Beers are expensive, poor selection and come in an obnoxious heavy glass to make you buy more (beer's here only come in 14oz- that's pretty terrible. Selection of beers is also just terrible for the upscale prices.

And when you throw down a taco- you MUST give me hot sauce- this is an automatic requirement. 

Bottom line: The flavour isn't there, it's expensive for no good reason.

Hard pass. Expect to spend $30 per person for food and drink."}
{"text":"Upbeat, amazing Tex mex resto located in the heart of Toronto! This place serves up quality food, with amazing flavours. Come drop by on a Tuesday for $10 for 3 tacos (note: the tacos are small but packs a bunch of flavour)! If you like your tequila, then you will love this place. Macho offers a variety of different types of tequila, with a $6 tequila every day!"}
{"text":"Ordered pretty much all the non pork items on the menu. Only the calamari was good. Everything else was okay. Had much better tacos and fajitas in other places. 

Overall ... very average"}
{"text":"Outdoor patio brunch.  Uhmazing!!! Bottomless mimosas with brunch $30.  Had the huevos rancheros with a side of chorizo.  Very flavourful and delicious!!  The patio is heated and has glass windows that creates barrier for wind.  I will run here again for brunch!!"}
{"text":"Service, interior, music, drinks and patio are all great. Price is reasonable for all the dishes except tacos. For $5 the taco is way too small. Presentation is great but to be honest the texture and flavour of all the dishes we had (guacamole and salsa and chips, a Santa Fe salad, two tacos and a fajitas) are not that well balanced, quite a few tasted under seasoned to my boyfriend and me. Overall, I think it's a great place to hang out in the cityplace neighbourhood with some Mexican drinks and food, but don't expect outstanding food here if you are a fan of La Carnita and Grand Electric."}
{"text":"Macho is a short walk from my condo and I've been meaning to try this place for a while. Overall I left disappointed. The popcorn squid appetizer was very too salty and we had to return it - all we could taste was salt! The tacos were okay. Bland and flavorless, and no comparison to grand electric or seven lives. At the time only a handful of tables were taken and they still managed to mix up orders between different tables and we waited a good 45 minutes for our tacos to arrive. However, once the Jays game was over - you would think they would hire more staff to manage the post game crowd? The place got packed and it took forever to get our bills (which was incorrect at first), ~15 minutes to get a corrected version, and then again a solid wait to pay. The only saving grace was our server who was very friendly, attentive (before the post game crowd rolled in), and very apologetic. Overall this establishment appears to be quite disorganized."}
{"text":"A group was organized for a get together for a going away brunch for one of our friends.  This place is located in the rather vertical neighborhood just west of Spadina and east of Bathurst along Fort York Blvd at the base of a condo complex.  While the place didn't have their patio set up yet it's obvious that they have the space for it but it was just getting warmer so it wasn't necessarily up and running just yet.

The space itself has high ceilings and the look of a pretty cool place.  There is a rather impressive vinyl collection on display as wall decor as well as the bar itself has a collection of cross and heart shaped something or others that I didn't know about but they the collection was also quite impressive considering it was the entire length of the bar.

The music playing was great and considering they have radio in their name you'd think that music would be a priority and it was.  

For a Sunday morning, I'm not sure what time brunch begins because I arrived at noon and the place was near capacity.  We had a reservation under my friend's name for 11 but the table we were given didn't really seat 11 comfortably.  It was a high top table against a vertical beam.  If we were 9 maybe but 2 more people couldn't sit at the other end.  Thankfully the other table across from us was leaving and the staff were able to move us to that table which had both ends open which allowed for us to all fit.  For as busy as the place was, the service was good.  

What makes this place seemingly busy is the fact that they offer a bottomless mimosas and brunch for 30 dollars.  The meals on the menu range from 12 to 15 bucks each and the mimosas should you order them separately are listed at 8 bucks.  You would have to drink about 2 to 3 to make \"make it worth your while\" so to speak.  Supposedly the rules are you can only have one at once (not order multiple at once) but since we were a large table all they did is bring over two bottles of chilled sparkling wine and juices to mix ourselves so that one at once rule sort of flew out the window if you're big enough of a table.

Drinks aside, the food was just ok.  I wouldn't go as far to say it was just meh but it's basically something I could have easily made at home.  What was listed as a 13 dollar breakfast was really in fact just perhaps a 4 dollar breakfast.  I had ordered the Tex which included Texas toast, home fries, 3 eggs, 4 slices of bacon and a few small pieces of chorizo.  Not exactly a good representation of Tex/Mex but rather just a pretty standard brekkie.  

While the service seemed friendly the food was just average at best and the unlimited drinks being the draw was also not extremely overwhelming of a deal.  I would have preferred unlimited bloody caesars instead as sweet juices aren't normally my jive.  Those are about 9 bucks each by the way.  I can see that this place is a business and morning cocktails are a thing but I didn't leave really feeling I received great value for what was received.  Still, this was only brunch, not dinner so I can't speak for the entire menu either.  Others that ordered other menu items, theirs did not necessarily look spectacular either.  

Macho while having a good vibe doesn't take me to another place with their food and drink and for that I can only give them a 3."}
{"text":"This was a very fun Mexican restaurant. Great decor and awesome staff. 

They had tons of choice and many of them were vegetarian. We opted not to have an appetizer and I'm glad that was the case because the main entree was so filling. 

I had a bean burrito and absolutely loved it! It was super tasty. 

We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"NACHOS was SOOOOO GOOD one of the best nachos I've ever had! Tacos were very pricey for the size! 

I left my purse (don't ask me how) and the staff were kind enough to hold it for me, great customer service definitely!"}
{"text":"Service sucks
I asked for a Sol and the server didn't know what that was. Lol your telling me your working at a Tex mex bar and not familiar with one of mexicos most popular beer??

I've been here enough times, same story, shit service. Food has potential and the place itself is nice but the people working there are fools

Go to el cabillito, el catrin, or La Carnita instead."}
{"text":"The $35 Margarita pitcher is a huge waste of money. The tacos are decent, but far from the best in Toronto. The atmosphere and patio are terrific, and we really enjoyed the flatbread Tex-Mex pizza and chorizo nachos."}
{"text":"I came to Macho Radio Bar looking for a solid patio, well-made drinks, and maybe some tasty dishes to snack on.

For starters, the patio is great. It's expansive, has plenty of seating, and is shielded from the wind with tall panes of glass. The couches are comfortable, but they definitely make you sit lower than if you were to sit on a chair, so drinking and eating off of the table may not be as easy as it should be, but damned if you won't be comfortable. The only downside is that you may not get much sun while you're there, given that it's situated between two very tall condos.

Service was good - our server being quite friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, providing quick and concise answers to questions about any food or drink we brought up.

I ordered an El Diablo cocktail to start, which I found to be a tad on the weak side, bordering on too-sour, possibly washing out any hint of tequila or ginger beer. I followed it up with the Mezcal Old Fashioned, which I also found to be too weak, and was a bit too heavy on the sweetness.

Our group split a plate of guac, and I ordered a pork shoulder taco, beer battered basa taco, and pork belly taco. The guacamole was great, no complaints. All three of the tacos were quite tasty as well, but I found portions for the proteins themselves to be on the small side, which was on an already small taco.

Overall, good patio, good service, but the food and drink really weren't very good. I'd go back, but I'd probably stick to a beer and a plate of guac."}
{"text":"I got an invite to come back after someone from management read my review and I'm honestly so glad I did. The service was amazing, the weather was perfect for the patio, and drinks are always great. I really loved the vibe of the patio--it had lots of lighting and the heaters really helped as it got a bit windy the later it got. A manager came to greet us to make sure everything was going well which I really appreciated and our waitress was the best (I wish I remembered her name).

To eat I got the nachos which was such a generous serving for an appetizer that I ended up taking the rest home and they still tasted good later on. My niece got the macho fries (I believe that's what they are called), and for someone as picky as her, she really enjoyed it and was impressed by the large serving as it was also an appetizer. We also got churros which we also enjoyed as they arrived at our table nice and hot with a delicious vanilla dip (which was my favorite) and a chocolate one as well. Drinks were also good--we got some tequila shots and mojitos. Last time I came I couldn't figure out why the mojito tasted different and the waitress informed me on this visit that they make it with tequila instead of rum. Nonetheless I enjoyed my drinks. 

Based on this experience I would definitely come back. Food was great, and service was too."}
{"text":"I don't get downtown much. Usually, my brother brings me takeout. He's wonderful that way. Tonight, he brought me back a pork belly taco and a beer battered basa (hehe. BBB) taco. At regular price, each one is $5. Supposedly, they have a 3/$10 special on Tuesdays. 

Upon looking at the pork belly taco, I was concerned because of the amount of chilis on it. I like spicy but I don't have a high tolerance for spice, so I was worried, but these chilis weren't too spicy. They added a tiny amount of kick, but more freshness that cut through the pork belly fat than anything. That was quite nice.

The BBB was almost fruity and coconutty, but to my knowledge, neither of those flavors was actually a part of the taco. I preferred this one, as it's on the lighter side and doesn't feel as unhealthy for me, even if the basa is deep fried. There was a decent amount of fish given the size of the taco. I kinda wish there was avocado in there, but that's cuz I like avocados, and I think a tad more creaminess in that taco would have worked well.

Both tacos were tasty, and I'd get them again at 3/$10, but I don't think I'd justify $5 for one (regular price)."}
{"text":"I swear, this must be the place where beautiful people gather. I mean everyone was a looker girls and guys. Sit on the patio for the best people watching.  Came here to check out the tequila bar..and had time to kill before Meeting Be careful because the flights can really take off. I started with a Dos Equis on tap...was flat..so I traded it for a Modello Especial.  Ahh hit that spot. Ordered 2 of the battered fish tacos...looks good and tasted ok. More fish less slaw next time... Got the tromba flight to wash it down. Blanco, Repasado and Anejo. Did the shot- taco-shot-taco- shot...and then ended with a margarita on the rocks. ..all in all it was a good 30 minutes of waiting. Will enjoy again."}
{"text":"Food was great and timely for 11am brunch. Service by Meaghan was amazing. Suggested bottles for brunch so we were in control of how much we were putting in our drinks. Louder music and fun environment. We played cards against humanity and drank with no pressure to leave. Plates seem small (we're from New York) but the portion was more than enough). So happy we came here! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's ok... for pre or post game from the Rogers Center.   Ask for the $5 drink specials."}
{"text":"Coming here mid-week to meet up with some of the guys. This is a relatively new spot in Concorde Place right across its stiff competition, Hunter's Landing.  
The place is hustling with lots of locals with no shortage of eye candy. 
Interior wise, the place is well spaced, beautiful open concept bar, big floor to ceiling glass with plenty of Mexican or Tex/Mex decor and furniture.  In addition they've got a beautiful patio which was out of commission due the a rain storm.
With its weekly specials, the service was great, however in terms of food, perhaps due to the time of day, our meals took forever to come out. 

For entree we ordered their popular, but small, and overpriced Tacos; Pork Shoulder, pork belly, and fish tacos.  Overall I would rate these tacos at a 1.5/5.  Though the flavors of the cilantro and other condiments were present, it lacked overall flavor of the meats/ fish aside from it being small.......smaller than La Carnitas.
Dessert, we all decided to try their popular Churros (Chcolate & Vanilla).  Churros were perfectly made, but just beware! it's HOT since its coming straight out of an oven. With rich sweet filling, the dish made up for the mediocre entree we had.  Overall I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"We had a large group (reservation) and they sat us at a fairly tiny table (like we were squeezed into a  table - great if we only wanted drinks, but no way if we wanted to eat as well).  We did ask to move (which did happen, but had to wait until another group left and the table was cleaned).

The space Is large - there is additional seating at the bar and a patio (not open when we were there).  The décor is interesting - vintage-y/eclectic/hippy.

There is a bottomless mimosa brunch special (which a few people did order) for $30.  If you want to drink a lot with your friends then definitely get this option.  I ordered the flatbread and could eat about half of it.  It was not very appetizing..lol .  I didn't get the tex/mex flavours from it either.  You can get additions to your meal but the prices seem odd - $2 for sour cream?  No thanks. 

It definitely gets packed here - the draw I'm sure is the brunch mimosas specials for sure."}
{"text":"First time to the restaurant. 
The food and drink from a quality standpoint were fantastic. Great Great food... But... Given the price... The portions were very small.... And the service was very confused and spotty."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great location
Outdoor patio
Great layout
Food was AMAZING
Staff was very helpful even when very busy
Great service
Great first experience
Price
Design

Cons:
The patio felt a bit busy
Didn't know about the restaurant until a friend showed me

Summary:
Great service and food, also great decor. I assume it's all about who you are with, but I will come back to Macho Radio Bar another time and see if i have the same experience. I want to give it 5 stars, but need to go back once more."}
{"text":"Here's what I love about this place (besides the bottomless mimosas, obviously): you can arrange a brunch for a large group of people without jumping through hoops. Whenever I've tried to book something similar at other restaurants, you have to pre-pay, you can't order from the regular menu, if one or two people cancel you need to pay a fee on their behalf, etc - I get that they don't want people to book huge tables and then not show up, but all the rules just make booking a headache. Not so here - the staff are super laid back and great at accommodating large groups. Both times I've been for brunch, Kevin has been our server and he's awesome - super friendly and attentive. For $32 you get a choice of brunch entree and bottomless mimosas with your choice of juice - orange, grapefruit, pineapple etc. If you have a big table they just bring bottles and all kinds of juice and you can mix and match. One star off just because the food isn't the greatest (it's not BAD, just not amazing) but for the price, it's good enough. In any case, I come for the mimosas!"}
{"text":"Very cool looking patio and nice vibe bar.
Food is good but very tiny portion. I had Taco and Fajita.
it's more fun in Summer that you can enjoy, but I wouldn't recommend if you are hungry and like to drink...
They are expensive... more like tapas restaurant."}
{"text":"Where do we even start...the decor is fine..the chair seat cloths are stained and ripped...
Service was...not really there...they sprayed table cleaning solution quite carelessly next to us so we were in the splash zone twice. The food came out at such different time intervals that we were pretty much finished the first dish before the second came out.  

The food is ok. The sauce for the flatbread waa good but the yolk was overcooked and the base too thick. The salmon benny was oddly small...one small pc of salmon for 2 benedicts.

The coffee was decent.

Probably wont go back..."}
{"text":"Not feeling the vibe here.  Bad karaoke inside or hockey on TV outside... like choosing firing squad or lethal injection.  This place picks up the overflow from neighbouring Hunter's Landing which has a much better crowd and feel.

The bathroom situation is a curiosity as there are three unisex closets to service a venue licensed for 180 occupants. How is that possible in a building less than two years old?  I digress...

Thinking guacamole and chips couldn't possibly be a challenge- I was mistaken.  Chips over-seasoned, and guacamole had more tomatoes and onions than avocado.

Came as close to dining and dashing as I have since high school after waiting 25 minutes to pay the bill.  In fairness, one bartender and one server tending to a jammed packed patio of maybe 80 customers .  Tough night."}
{"text":"Macho is a welcome addition to CityPlace! We've gone here quite a few times and have never left disappointed. 
We regularly ask for Cody because he's fantastic but other servers have not disappointed when he's not there! 

The Hits: 
The music, venue, overall vibe, Pork Belly Tacos, Basa Tacos, Guacamole, Mini Tostadas, Santa Fe salad and The Specials! 

The misses: Mex flatbread, popcorn squid 

Definitely worth trying out! This is a new regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Macho Radio Bar is located on Fort York near the condominiums that we stayed during our trip to Toronto. Given a few words, the restaurant / bar is clean, spacious, trendy, and offers an ambiance that suits well for yuppies.  

The menu is not as extensive, but it does have the necessary categories of drinks, appetizers, salads, tacos, and \"macho plates.\" Prices are a bit higher and portions can be a little small, but that is kind of expected given the location of this bar. 

I ordered the smoked steak show fajitas:

- Included red peppers, poblano, red peppers, onion, tortillas. All of this is served with side condiments of onions, guac, sour cream, and the delicious green / red bottle of house hot sauce (4/5)

- The steak was tender and complemented well with the sauces and greens. The only thing to note was the portion was very small, as I was given three tortillas and a few slices of steak - a bit pricey (second most expensive dish), but again, remember the location and targeted audience 

Overall, Macho Radio Bar gets the job done for some decent Mexican cuisine in a more trendy and rooftop feel"}
{"text":"Was there when it first opened and have to say, the place has gone downhill for sure.  Maybe because it was raining out, but the place inside was filled. And loud.  Very loud. But no one was eating.  That should have been a sign.  We ordered the steak fajitas, a large guacamole/chips and a salad.  Portions are now pathetically small.  Drinks are cheap (I guess that's why no one else was eating - $5 house wine on a Friday night and $5/6 other drinks).  My suggestion:  eat somewhere else then come by here if you want a drink. You can't really talk, though, so don't count on being able to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Worst nachos I've ever had. I realized after the plate was put in front of me that I should've read the list of ingredients better, but I'm so used to having nachos with diced fresh veggies that it didn't even cross my mind to read. Beef fajitas weren't great either, chewy and fatty meat. The only positive thing I can mention about food was the fresh guacamole for fajitas and tasty tortilla chips they used for nachos, but doubt they made the chips on site. Sangria was ok, a big pitcher for $20 (special that day), but definitely lacking flavour. Definitely don't come here for the food.
The patio is nice and very comfortable, just try to keep the seats clean not just tables! The hostess took us to a table and she saw me sweeping crumbs of the bench cushions before I sat down and didn't even occur to her to apologize or acknowledge it. Our waiter was great, one of the best services I've had in life, both stars go to him."}
{"text":"Visited for the weekend and checked this place out because we saw something online for bottomless mimosas. They aren't actually bottomless anymore, but $22 got you a brunch meal + one mimosa, then each additional bottle was $10 or glass was $2, which was still a great deal. Not too many options but the food was solid, I got the huevos rancheros. We got there at 11am right when they opened and were the only people there for a good 45min but by the time we left it was filled out. Good music, good vibes, good service. Definitely would head back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"great food and atmosphere! Prices and daily deals are really good! Weekend brunches are also really good. Good service."}
{"text":"A really, really great brunch experience! Tasty brunch options, and $2 top up mimosas with four different juice favours available...this is a go-to place for my friends and I!

I love their eggs benny, but I find the portion to be a bit small for the price...nonetheless extremely tasty. If I find myself to be really hungry, I usually go for the Tex Mex big breakfast, which comes with a very large portion of classic breakfast foods. The mimosas are all very refreshing, and for $10 you can order a whole bottle of bubbly and a carafe of your choice of juice to mix your own mimosas!

Always had superb service here, the servers are extremely attentive and cater to your needs. It does get busy pretty quickly, but it just adds to the fun atmosphere. Would highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Came for the bottomless mimosas at brunch, which are really the only reason I'd come back.

Food portions were surprisingly small, and weirdly served on a silver metal disc instead of a proper plate. The food was just okay. The home fries were mushy and not at all crispy.

Servers were friendly, if not very attentive or organized. I sat for 10 minutes before being brought water or a menu. Juice for our mimosas sometimes came in a proper pouring vessel, and other times in a regular drinking glass, which meant lots of spilled juice. I did like that our server just left a bottle of sparkling wine at the table for the two of us."}
{"text":"One of the few places in Toronto that offer a bottomless mimosa bar for a reasonable price of $29. Also there is a range of juices to choose from.

The decor is modern and open concept with a large patio. The servers are responsive and friendly. 

I find the food portions a little bit small and overly salty, but overall it's a nice experience. I've been there like 3 times in large groups, and splitting the cheque is never an issue."}
{"text":"i had a good experience at macho. the service was prompt and friendly, though perhaps a bit confused. 

the decor is laid-back, sports bar friendly, but you can also still see evidence of its past glory as citta. depending on your mood, it's either eclectic or weird.

the food is generally very good. all the tacos I tried were delicious. the beef brisket was a bit odd looking, but it tasted alright. the dish I really loved was the macaroni and cheese. it was the perfect blend of cheeses.

regarding the value, given the quality, the price is acceptable, but it's pushing it a bit imho."}
{"text":"We decided to come back and give it a second chance because we live a block away and it's a great place to hang out with friends. We noticed the service was a lot better this time around. 

Our server was very attentive and constantly checked up on us to ensure we have everything we needed. All the food came out quickly and it tasted good. 

Unlike other reviews, I actually don't think the price is high for the quality of food your are getting. We ordered the steak fajita, it costed $14 and came with 4 tortillas, guac, pico de gallo and sour cream.  The meat was tender and perfectly cooked medium rare.  There was an abundance of meat that we actually asked for more tortillas which our server happily gave us.  We also ordered the Santa Fe salad,  for $8, you get fresh corn trimmed from the cob, cherry tomatoes, chickpeas and fried corn nuts for the crunch. It was very refreshing and definitely the crowd pleaser of the night. We also order a mix of tacos, $5 each but that have 3 for $10 specials every Tuesday. My favourite is still the chilli chicken. It has a really unique blended taste that just goes well all together. Lastly, if you like cheese, the mushroom cheese with chips starter is a must! 

I would definitely come back again. Keep up the good service level!"}
{"text":"Not sure about this place. I finally gave it a try and it happened to be karaoke night. I was not impressed. 

Drinks: On the expensive side unless you get their specials.

Food: Flavours are ok, not wow. Portion sizes are tiny. We're talking two bite portions or Tapas sizes. 
They're supposed to be known for their tacos and fajitas, but you'll be better off going to Wilbur Mexicana, or la carnitas for the same price and better flavour and portioned tacos. I've tried their fish, pork shoulder and pork belly and they were all just decent. Not memorable other than how tiny/expensive they were. ($5-$6 each for bite size tacos I know I can make better). $15/$16 for fajitas that come on a plate the size of your palm was not exactly what I had in mind when I came for dinner. 

Service: Not so great at first. Sort of just walk in and try to find a clean table and seat yourself. No one greets you, no sign telling you to seat yourself or be seated, no eye contact from anyone working there.. you really can't even tell who works there.. unless you see their apron. Someone will eventually come to give you a menu after you find a seat at a table that is not dirty. 
+.5 for the server who came to help out. 

Not sure if we picked a bad night but this place is like walking into a restaurant having an identity crises. It's usually dead in there but the crowd must have been there for the karaoke that night.

 I think it's trying to go for a casual Mexican Tapas bar theme. (which would be cool if they could pull it off). It feels more like a Tapas restaurant selling overpriced bar food or an upscale Bar selling crappy Mexican style Tapas. 

First time and probably last time I would be in here for food. It has potential, but unless the service, food portion, or price points change.. it's sort of a tourist cash grab.."}
{"text":"Executive Summary: Macho Tex Mex Radio Bar is a cute place to check out if you're hungry for something above basic pub fare and are in the area for a game, visiting friends, or livinng in the area.

Value (Price/Quality): Good - price point is fair for portion size and quality of ingredients

You'll like this place if: If you're a local in CityPlace neighbourhood who doesn't want to go far for decent Mexican. Gorgeous bathroom if you need to go and like bright outdoor spaces.

Don't go here if: If you absolutely love Seven Lives or El Catrin

Transportation: No parking. Limited Street parking, Ample bike parking. Limited parkades in the area. Best to walk. Public Transit only on Bathurst or Spadina streetcars

Tip: Sangria Sunday's $20. Daily specials to keep you coming back! Cute crowd too for singles or for date night.

The Good, Bad and Ugly Details: Gorgeous patio space with heaters on cool nights. TV near the outdoor bar for game nights!

Yelp Customer Bottom Line: Come visit if you live in the area or visiting friends. Not a destination.

Business Opportunity: Price per Taco is high compared to competitors offering larger sizes at cheaper prices. Taco Tuesday is a good deal!"}
{"text":"Ok I have been here several times and I am giving this place 4 stars. It has one of the best patios in Cityplace, and great  Mexican dishes at very reasonable prices. Start with the Guacamole and tortia chips. I believe its made here fresh everyday. The wings are very good too, but avoid the 'hot' wings as the spice empowers the chicken to the point where you can't enjoy them (unless of course you love everything hot). Service is great, décor is very cool and they have a games room set up in the corner with a vintage Miss PacMan and Galaga game, a golf game and some pinball machines. Great place to hang out, but definitely not a good place if you are disabled (this is something they need to address) I used to be a regular at the Fox , just down the street, bu now this is my main go to place when I want a drink or a snack with some friends. I don't think I would have a full course meal here with so many options on nearby King, but its definitely a fun, clean place."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for the small servings but very tasty. The chicken wings are so good. I got the spicy ones but I couldn't handle it."}
{"text":"Location and menu looks promising. Disappointing first experience. We were seated in the patio area - table was dirty, one of the chairs was missing a cushion. Service was.. forgivable, I think our server was a trainee. 
My biggest issue was the timing of our food; the appetizers and main came almost 20 minutes later.. at the same time, if not later than our mains. If I order appetizers, I expect it to come first.
Dessert had to be sent back, cause one of it was wrong. Again, forgivable for a new restaurant still training their servers. But the service just didn't feel sincere.. and if I'm choosing to spend my time and money visiting your establishment, I think it's fair to expect a good experience.. and unfortunately, this was not it. 
Oh, I almost forgot about the food. Got the tostadas, fish taco, and fajitas.. all very underwhelming and presentation was lacklustre. Really wanted to like this place.."}
{"text":"Overall disappointing.

I'm not hard to please but it was just one thing after another. Went for my birthday, which my friend told the server who didn't acknowledge. Tiny portions for high prices, asked for large chips and guacamole and was told AFTER the only difference between small and large is the guacamole, not the chips (4 people obviously need more than a sad cereal bowl of tortillas). Smallest soft shell tacos I've ever seen, server didn't know the drink menu and the ounces aren't listed. That on top of the crap chairs and tables, just so disappointing.  The food took ages too, and by the time my friends meal came everyone else was finished.

Would also say very Limey food, and the server's clear plates faster than you can eat off them. 
It was super clean however, nicely renovated and good music. Still a bummer though!"}
{"text":"What to try:

Their flatbreads. Mex or Tex flatbread. Both for $13. Portion size is just enough for one person though. They bake their flat bread in their wood burning oven and the dough of the flatbread is soft and warm. Very flavorful and not too heavy. 

What can be better: 

The tacos. For the price of $4-$5 for one taco, one order of the tacos  is not enough to fill a meal. More like a snack. However when I received my basa taco, on flour tortilla, it was cold and the tortilla was hard at the rim. This means it wasn't fresh tortillas and may be either pre made ahead of time or left out to dry for awhile. I don't think the price justifies the taco portion you get. When I went they didn't have the macho fries and the nacho loco because they sold out. So be prepared when you go, they might not have all the menu items available for order. 

What to expect of the decor:

Nice ambiance. Very laid back and there are arcade games at a corner for you to enjoy. Good amount of tv screens to watch sports and a very big patio space to host parties or hang out. 

I didn't like the high top chairs for dinner though. Feels uncomfortable to enjoy your dinner after sitting for awhile. The music gets way too loud when the late night hours start. If the music was a tad softer, it would be great to enjoy a beer, have a conversation and still enjoy the music. 

Last tips: book early and request for patio if you want to sit in the patio over the summer time. I'd say go for the flatbread because it's the freshest and not so much a fan of the tacos. The late night menu has some of the items in the dinner menu but still at the same price so it doesn't matter when you go. Going late night doesn't mean you're saving money!"}
{"text":"I'll leave my previous review below as reference to my experience there yesterday.   

Again after a Jays game but not on a Friday night.  Lots of Eurocup soccer fans around, very busy and vibrant scene. 

At the front reception though, again had an issue with people being let in ahead.  They didn't have a reservation and nor did my friend and I.  However we were there first and asked to wait 5-10 minutes, no problem.  When I saw the other two people get seated immediately I questioned why I was bothering.  Reception staff were the same as our last visit so I was even more concerned.   I asked to see Miguel, the manager who reached out to me after my last review.  

I explained the concerns, he listened calmly and asked if we would try it.  I said yes because he was very sincere and honestly once inside have no regrets. 

Drinks were great, palomos are awesome.  Gorditas and tacos are phenomenal.   Nice atmosphere inside, great vibe. 

The only qualifier is the front reception.  Once the game was over everyone left.  However at the restaurant next door is was packed still.  So something is up there.   

I'm going with three stars, because of the reception both times.  Once you're in you will love it.  




If I could give a minus rating I would.

Normally I'm pretty tolerant of busy spots but the greeting staff managed our large poorly. They allowed smaller groups around us and then told us later they wouldn't serve us. 

Yes this was after a Jays game but be professional and say sorry and no before letting us wait for 25 minutes.  

Disappointed."}

Machos biggest problem is its wait staff.
