{"text":"Best Brisket Ever! We had a Christmas Eve party and had it catered with the help of Matt and Andrew of Pork on a Fork Catering.  The order was correct, they arrived on time, and Andrew set up all of the food. Our guests loved the food. The brisket was \"the best brisket I've ever had\" according to multiple guests. It was finished long before the rest of the food items. Next most popular were the au gratin potatoes. What a hit!"}
{"text":"We had Pork on a Fork cater an event and were really pleased with everything, especially the customer service.

We ordered the turkey and pulled pork, as well as mac and cheese, beans, buns and cornbread.  I was pleased that they provided 3 types of barbecue sauce, each in a plastic squeeze bottle, which is so much better than those typical messy styrofoam cups and spoons.  People really liked the food. 

The delivery driver arrived on time in a professional vehicle and set everything up nicely.  She was great!  The trays, stand and chafing fuel things did a great job of keeping the food warm and still worked 4 hours later. 

POAF even threw in an extra pan of pork! Plus they responded promptly to our initial request and even wrote us a follow up letter to make sure we were happy. How nice!"}
{"text":"Pork on a Fork catered a sales event at our apartment complex. It was so delicious!!! The brisket was smokey and the perfect texture. The chicken was not very appealing, honestly. It was rubbery and dry. But the Mac and cheese was on point! Not dry or bland at all. The baked beans were surprisingly delicious and had a little bite to them. To top it all off there were 3 yummy bbq sauces- smokey and sweet being my favorite. We will definitely be in the restaurant to try out more!"}
{"text":"Where to begin with this DELICIOUS CORNICOPIA of Yumminess that is Pork on a Fork!!?  
Please allow me to paint you a picture...
You open the door and before your eyes can adjust an amazing aroma literally grabs your taste buds, lifts you off your feet, and as you float on flavor clouds of sweet tangy and smokey, you drift further into the building!  The charming staff is all hustle and bustle but they smile and greet you with a big friendly \"Hello\"!   
At first, you may think the line you're facing is a negative and you'll consider leaving, but I'm going to implore you to instead recall that saying \"All good things come to those who wait\"!!
You'll want all that time to review the menu options.  Did I say options?  I meant...lots of OPTIONS!!! Hasn't anyone ever told the owners, you don't give a woman options!?!   Or a man when it comes to MEAT selections!  
You'll be challenged to decide on getting; Bowls, Burritos, Slabs, Sliders and for the true Meat connoisseur they will happily give you a beautiful tray of your choice of JUST THE meat!  Not just meat...but WORLD famous PORK... and then THE most TENDER BEEF BRISKET your mouth has ever had the pleasure of melting!  Oh ... don't forget the Pulled Chicken!   Right in front of you, let's call him the \"Meat Godfather\" or MG for short, the MG will cut your steaming hot meat to order right in front of you. No ginormous heat lamps...no heat chaffing dishes or other apparatus' just a cutting board, scale, knife and your meat selections!    How the MG doesn't burn his glove covered phalanges of magic off from the heat, well I have no idea...but he cuts, pulls slices and builds your meal again right in front of you!   LOVE THIS!!! Nothing behind the scene here folks.  And the cuts of meat ... no fat to tip the scales!    Whatever meat you ask the MG for you WILL NOT BE disappointed!  NOTE:  They DO have meatless options as well - Bless their little round heads, they've just thought about this for everyone!
How do you compliment 15 hours of smoked heaven???  Choose a sauce my friends that is how!  You'll get to pick from the following sauces:  Sweet & Mild, Smokey Tangy and Crazy J's Hot!   Now, I'm all about the flavor of meat so I don't use a lot of sauce.  So, it's only fair I only review my favorite which is Sweet & Mild which is exactly like its name sake sweet and mmhmmmhmmmMild! 
What!?!?! This review goes on...why yes! YES! it does because now we must talk about my two favorite sides!!  To compliment your proteins, they offer Baked BBQ Beans.  Now these bad boys have the right amount of sweet and savory along with a little smack on your tongue at the end, which to me is equivalent to a smack on the derriere that says \"good job fellas\".  But truly, your number one side selection is going to be the always hot, steamy, cheesy, makes your eyes close as the flavors explode in your mouth, 3 Cheese Macaroni & Cheese!  What makes this side stand out from the regular Mac & cheese you microwave...it's got to be that Fantastical Spice - BOLD R DASH!   It's like that famous chef says \"BAM!\" They sprinkle that delicious spice on top of the three-cheese gooeyness and trust me you'll find yourself eating THAT alone before anything else!
In addition to all this wonderful food, I must say the Energetically Passionate Staff is Amazing!  I've had them cater my work and personal events more than 10 times over the past two years!     They are kind, polite, clean Food Magicians!  And how many companies have the owners making deliveries!?!?!  Yep, that's right!    He didn't think I knew, but on more than one occasion our event order was delivered by the owner!   The GRADE A Service he delivered with a smile makes him my number one choice when I'm called to get an event catered.
In short folks, you can't go wrong if you stop in for a bite!  There isn't anything on the menu that I've tried so far that hasn't had me quoting Homer Simpson \"Can't talk eating\"!!!   It's EXCELLENT food, prepared by passionate employees and rounded out with extremely humble and wonderful owners!  I wish this company many more years of growth and prosperity!    
 
Here's some fine Print I'd like to bring to light:    All Natural, Fresh Never Frozen Chicken, Meats Smoked over 15 hours with Pecan & Mesquite, No Antibiotic, Vegetarian Fed Pork!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about Veronica and her team at Pork on a Fork. I threw a big party for my husband's 50th birthday, but the one thing I didn't really plan was the food.  I needed quantity for an affordable price.  With short notice, Veronica pulled together a meal for my 70 guests, delivered the food, and did not break my bank.  The food was delicious!  Thank you to Veronica and her team for helping me be the \"best wife ever\" by pulling this party off with the best food ever!"}
{"text":"I have catered Pork on a Fork multiple times and the food is always a crowd pleaser!!  I cater 5 times a week and Pork on a Fork is the easiest place I've worked with to date.  You receive an email when your order has left their store and another email when the order is arriving.  I LOVE THIS!

It's a smooth process to order online and a quick confirmation response. Veronica is always so helpful if there are any questions.  

I always order the 3 meat package (Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket and Bacon Wrapped Meatballs, Mac n'cheese, Beans, Salad, Cookies for desert and drinks)....mmmm..mmmm....delish!  The food is always fresh, warm and hands down beats any BBQ place in the valley that I have catered before.

I will be sticking to Pork on a Fork for all of my BBQ catering needs."}
{"text":"I used Pork on a Fork Catering for a company event.  Veronica and the rest of the staff were knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating.  They were able to help be order the correct amount of food and were flexible with any last minute changes.  They were here at the agreed upon time and handled all of the set-up.  I have worked with many other catering companies in the past and Pork on a Fork certainly exceeded my expectations!  The service was excellent and the food was delicious!  I look forward to working with them again in the future!"}
{"text":"Pork on a Fork is the Best!!!  All the meats are cooked to perfection and the pasta salad is incredible. Try it with some Tabasco and that alone will keep you going back. I use them every year for my Christmas Party and everyone there rants and raves about how good the food and sauces are! I also referred them to my mortgage company and they have also used them for a number of events!  The staff is incredible and food is just that good!  Writing this review is making me crave it right now. See you soon I guess!"}
{"text":"We love pork on a fork! 
Called the catering dept; the woman I spoke with was very nice and extremely helpful! 
A girl named Hail delivered our food and was right on time and very friendly!
All of our guests loved the food! 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have had Pork on a Fork cater to our office a few times. From looking at their menu, I found more than enough options for me to choose from for our 80 employees. We usually go with the basic bbq - pulled pork, chicken, brisket, beans, and coleslaw. Everything is always wonderful; from the customer service to the delicious food!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing...My company has an office in Los Angeles and one in Phoenix.  When there is a large function requiring lunch, it is my job to order for the Phoenix office.  Imagine my delight several months ago that I stumbled onto Pork on a Fork.  The result:  A very large office full of people happily eating delicious bbq to their hearts' content.  This place is amazing!!!  Not only is the customer service great, which it is, but my orders have always been delivered on time by very gracious folks with nary an issue.  The food is always hot and fresh.  I should insert here that this is feedback I get from those associated who are fortunate enough to get to eat it.  Oh Pork on a Fork, when will you open a location in the Los Angeles area???

Another plus...their prices are crazy good also.  Listen folks, if you're looking for great food at great prices with an awesome staff, then this is where you need to order from.  Whether it's work-related or personal, Pork on a Fork is THE go-to place!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were bored with the same ole' wedding menus that many caterers offered so when we started thinking about places that just offered good food we reached out to Pork on a Fork. The process to get a quote was painless and we had a lot of options to choose from. We selected the three meat option with hand pulled chicken, brisket, and pulled pork. For sides we chose potatoes au gratin, mac and cheese, and beans. As starters we ordered the chicken wings and bacon wrapped meatballs. We opted to do rolls and corn bread as well. 

Our catering contact Kristina set up a testing at the location closest to us and we had an amazing spread of options to taste to ensure we were happy with our selection. We had two people on site the day of our event for a group of about 80 guests. We asked the caterers to bring out trays to our guests during cocktail hour and then they hosted a buffet style line for our dinner. The set-up looked nice but we did opt to use our own plastic wear rather than the plastic bundled sets provided. They provided plates in either black or white included in the price. Service was friendly, went swift, and there was plenty of food (and then some) for our guests. People were very excited to have an interesting and yummy option to eat at the wedding and we didn't hear a single negative comment of the food. 

There was some confusion about our order so the caterers originally did not bring any cornbread but once it was brought up they took care of it right away and got the bread there in time for our guests to enjoy it. 

I would absolutely recommend POAF to anyone looking to host an event and if I have the opportunity again in the future I will absolutely use them again. This was one of the least stressful things on my wedding day and that was a huge blessing!"}
