{"text":"Great burgers and a great menu to choose from. For less than 8 bucks you will be satisfied believe me. Inside is a little bit cramped especially if it's the rush hour when schools let's out around 3pm. Before sure to avoid that time."}
{"text":"The food is very good and the prices a good.  But its all so Painfully slow!! Take an order - run down stairs, take an order - run down stairs get a burger, take an order - run downstairs get something else.  Why can we take all the orders then run downstairs ang et all the stuff in one go!??  Today I figured Id get ahead of the game and phone in my order they told me 20 mins so that's when I got there.  When I got there the order was sitting waiting but due to the 2 people in front it literally took be 10 mins to get to be served!!  If they could just serve in a more timely manor this place would be excellent and I for one would go there much more often."}
{"text":"Grest pricesGreat place great food  Moment I walk in he always knows what I want.always friendly smile"}
{"text":"I went there at least twice a month but the owner didn't like to treat me as a regular customer and wanted to charge me 50 cent for some mayo for the fries... Typical cheap Chinese owner. Never going again."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall burger joint.  Burgers are cheap (around $4 or $6 for a combo) and the service is always friendly.  This is my go-to burger place."}
{"text":"Not bad for a little place along Lakeshore. I used to stop in here from time to time when I felt like a burger, as I went to school close by.   There isn't much in the way of decor. Just a small counter to order at, and a separate counter to eat at, enough room for like 5 people. The burgers are pretty good. Always well cooked, with a nice texture. They're slightly on the bland side, but the condiments easily help with that. The poutine is decent too. I like their choice of fries.  The wait for food isn't usually too bad. The guys behind the counter are alright too.  Super Burger isn't gourmet or anything, but it's good and cheap. Don't expect to spend more than 10 bucks (unless you really go all out)."}
{"text":"I don't know. I was told about this place from a co-worker. I would go to the burger place up the street. This place has better food but not enough toppings. Over all I wouldn't go out of my way for a super burger.  The serving of rings I got was horrible."}
{"text":"Yes, another burger joint review. Don't like it? Go read some hot dog reviews.  So, I stumbled upon this place one burger-jonesing afternoon, though I still swear the sign read \"Super Burger\" and not \"Burger Super\", but maybe I'm going senile at my young age.  In any case, we're not reviewing the sign.  Inside, there is only a small counter to sit at, which seats maybe 8 people, but this appears to be more of a take-out place.  They had varying thicknesses of their burgers, but of course I opted for the much-desirable Super Burger.   Their prices were cheap, the service was friendly, the wait was short, and the selection of condiments was very decent.  As for the burger itself, perfectly cooked, very tasty and filling! I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"My favourite place when I was in college. Their menu is as good as it is (unintentionally) funny. Prices are on the low end, but most of the food is a lot of bang for your buck.   Especially the super burger used to be a feast for poor students. They used to do buns covered in cheese on the inside. Hope they still do!"}
{"text":"Visiting town & stopped here for take-out tonight.  Great food & great service.  The whole family was pleased!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers with good combo prices.  It can take some time for them to get to your order.  I do wish they did wings also.  Place is popular for the student crowd."}
{"text":"It's a small store in a corner of a small street. I was roaming downtown and drove by this place. I decided to go in to check their menu. The mini fast food parlour had a great variety of burgers/ side dishes. I had the grilled chicken burger and a regular poutine on the side. The wait didn't take long and the total came up to around $9.50. All the items on the menu are very inexpensive compared to all the other burger joints. The poutine was a large portion and gravy was the right amount. I just felt that they should have put a bit more cheese. For burger toppings there wasn't many and that when I asked for shredded lettuce it was an empty tin but a burger joint should always have inventory. I guess he was too lazy to get me any.. He ended up digging up the sides of the lettuce and gave me the few pieces that were left. There weren't many dressing options for the burgers. I found that the bun they used was a bit on the dry side but the grilled chicken had a special taste to it that made the burger stand out to me. Not the best but also not the worst."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. A 1000x times yes. This is a true burger joint. Great price for a tasty burger, and I loved the fries too. The owner, who is very nice, is the only one I've seen in there. Skip the McDonald's, because this is a better bet without a doubt. Better priced for a better burger."}
{"text":"Don't underestimate this place. The burgers are surprisingly delicious, and the fries are better than a lot of famous fast-food joints. The owner should get a Nobel Prize for his Onion Ring Poutine."}
