{"text":"I really like this place. Close to Nature.  Coffee is really good  and I really like drinking it outside on their patio. Oh and the ice cream is delicious. Hidden gem in Fish Creek Park."}
{"text":"My wife was super excited when she saw the historic building housing this bakery and cafe. Two stars mostly for price, and limited selection for a spot that bills itself as a bakery. The items on offer were pretty tasty, but neither old fashioned farm style, nor particularly fancy for a shop run by CRMR, and two items cost $7+.  This price tag would be easier to swallow if the nondescript interior of the shop had a rustic atmosphere, like the heritage building that houses it.  Two stars is a bit harsh, I realize it's tough to make a profitable seasonal business out of such a venture, but I was disappointed after going out of the way to try it out. A more apt name like Annie's Snack Shack would set expectations appropriately, and adding a few rustic touches would set the mood better."}
{"text":"While the food there is really good (soups, salads,  sandwiches, cookies, ice cream, and  even some gluten free treats) and it is a great place to pop in while biking through Fish Creek Park, the staff can be quite rude. The woman taking orders impatiently sighed and rolled her eyes at me, twice, when I asked her a question regarding the beverages that were offered.  VERY unprofessional!  I thought the soup nazi was only on the Seinfeld show."}
{"text":"This little ma and pa cafe in the heart of Fishcreek park. Menu is limited to soups, coffee, sandwiches and of course hard ice cream.   Staff are friendly and debit and credit is taken here.   Lots of sitting area for the size of the cafe but also lots of picnic tables outside too.   Overall great place of a light snack and ice cream while strolling through Fishcreek Park."}
{"text":"I remember visiting Annie's when I was a little girl before the buildings had been bought and refurbished into what they are now. After Annie's and it's more sophisticated neigbour, the Ranche Restaurant, opened, it was a favourite summertime hangout with friends.  For anyone living in the neighbourhoods surrounding Fish Creek park in the south end of the city, Annie's has been a popular seasonal destination for years - ice cream being the biggest draw. It usually opens up in May and closes down by mid-September every year, so check their website for updated hours of operation  Annie's has undergone many changes in management over the years, so there is often a new menu and approach taken to the baked goods and lunches served each summer. The food is almost always top notch however, with ingredients and dishes courtesy of the Ranche's kitchen and made from inspiring combinations of local ingredients and exotic flavours. The honey-melon dressing on a simple spinach salad used to be my favourite, and the date squares and pear and mascarpone turnovers can't be missed - if they haven't already sold out.  For a quick breakfast or morning coffee, the muffins and other baked goods are always good value. However, be sure to bring your credit/debit with you if you plan to ride your bike down for a lunchtime meal - the prices can be quite high for a family order, and most leisure riders are not prepared for the extra expense with enough change in their pockets.  Annie's is best visited in the mornings or late afternoons, to avoid the midday rush. With its deep roots in Calgary's homesteading history, and natural (although not entirely native) setting in Fish Creek Park, it's worth a visit by bike, car, or foot for any Calgarian or visitor looking for a bite of the past."}
{"text":"Located just a stones throw away from Bow Valley Ranche Restaurant is a tiny cafe called Annie's. We decided to stop in after brunch for a little dessert.  Lots of selection to choose from including soups, sandwiches, salads, ice cream and pastries. You can even get wine, beer and cider if you're feeling boozy. Pastry case is filled with all types of goodies. Muffins, scones and cinnamon buns to round things out.  - Passionfruit ($3.75) - one scoop is $3.75, two is $5.75. Add another dollar for a waffle or sugar cone. O is apparently in love with their passionfruit flavour but I couldn't quite pinpoint what it tasted like to me. It didn't have a hint of passionfruit. Kind of tasted like a really light, subtle peach flavour. This ain't no Village Ice Cream.  Cute spot to drop in if you're walking/biking/Pokemon Go'ing in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to try it."}
