{"text":"Great Bubble Tea.  The milk tea taste very authentic and unlike other places I had been around town.  I think it's because it came right from Taiwan."}
{"text":"This place is great and is in a perfect location for when I need to satisfy my bubble tea cravings during work hours.  The employees here are super friendly and helpful - especially to the new comers. There is sooo many options/modifications to make your drink really \"your drink\" which always makes me happy. (PS they have popping pearls!!)  It can be slow/ fast service depending on when you go and how busy it is, but I never mind waiting since the product I leave with is magical!   I cannot wait to go back - however, just keep in mind that this space is tiny and it is a grab and go concept."}
{"text":"Oh em gee! It's bubble tea!   And that, my friends, is my rhyme of the day.   Dale and I stumbled upon Itea on a random very cold weekday, and what a fun find! This place is half the size of most bubble tea places, but ten times more fun! They had a huge menu, but the best part was everything was customizable! You want a hot bubble tea or cold? Want to watch your sugar intake and want less sugar? Or like everything extra sweet? Or how about your bubbles, how do you like em? Straight up tapioca bubbles? Lychee/green apple/aloe vera jelly? Or what about mango popping bubbles or yogurt popping bubbles???? It's all customizable! The amount of sheer choices is plain awesome!   The Taiwanese popcorn chicken was tasty also. Once again, 4 different flavours.   Oh, the ladies working at the counter deserve a special mention. I can't even tell you how many times they asked us if we liked our bubble tea, or if we would like anything else, or if we would like to try any other bubbles! Seriously unlike most Chinatown establishments!   I will definitely be back - more yummy bubble tea times await at Itea!"}
{"text":"Peaaaarls! Pearls! Pearls! - Is what Mötley Crüe would have been singing had this place existed in the 80's. And I'm glad it didn't! A song about bubble tea, no matter how delicious, flops in comparison to the sex, drugs and rock'n'roll power ballads that dominated hair metal. BUT, when it comes to straight up Bubble Tea sans song lyrics, iTea flops in comparison to no store!   This place is my favourite serendipitous stumble upon in quite some time. It's super small, crazy colourful (tight and bright if you will,) and is run by the sweetest ladies in existence. There were more quality and customer satisfaction checks at this tiny, take-out bubble tea nook than your favourite high-end restaurant.   I'm not going to pretend to be a bubble tea savant, but if you are, I think these teas will live up to your standards. They told me they are more than happy to make the teas less or more sweet to your preference.  Why pearls pearls pearls? They have more pearls and jelly varieties than I ever knew existed. They're laid out along the counter so you can look them over before making your choice. They even let *Sabz and I sample a few. I went with a Peach Tea with Mango Popping Pearls. SO good - I regret nothing! Popping pearls, if you're not familiar are small, round, edible packets that explode with juicy flavour when you bite them. **They're like a tiny bath bead, only much much more delicious.**  If you want more than one you can get multiple pearl flavours, its possible for an extra 50 cents.  iTea is spot on where it matters with a quirky touch of authenticity. One of the ladies apologized for a spelling mistake on their Bubble Tea stamp card (312 Cetner St.:) ) but little things like this just make me like my experience at iTea all that much more.  FOOD TO GO! They've got 4 flavours of Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken, and fish balls. The popcorn chicken was a tasty snack to go along with the teas. Any fish ball fiends out there let me know what you think.  *If you don't follow Sabahat N.'s reviews, you're missing out: http://www.yelp.ca/user_details?userid=uEKuEB0lsvd-Ht8z4ekEiw  **Despite their look and aroma, bath beads taste REALLY disgusting. -This life lesson brought to you by 4 year old Dale E. I take no responsibility if you decide to snack on your Body Shop products."}
