{"text":"amazing!!! I am so happy I found a Hungarian place that serves AMAZING food. the owner is so so nice, and the food was fantastic. these people deserve your money!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin. Great find in the upper beaches area. Home cooked Hungarian food. Atmosphere is laid back easy going with great service. My husband I ordered the Hungarian sausage and the crepe with beef/sauce to start. OMG! The crepe was delish! I had the chicken parikash for my main and he had the weiner schnitzel. The portions are huge and the flavour is miraculous. I cannot wait to be back."}
{"text":"If you have a grandmother who makes schnitzel, sorry grandma this is better. These ladies know what they're doing, call ahead and get take out. These women are amazing and have great local pride."}
{"text":"This little gem deserves wide spread advertising. However, it is very busy most of the time so word of mouth appears to be equally as effective. The first time we went there, I felt as comfortable as if I were in my Hungarian grandmother's home. The owner who is also the chef is Hungarian born and the food is truly familiar and made with love. She is very precise about every order that leaves the kitchen and makes each of her customers feel special. And it shows. The customers come back again and again and many have chosen this cozy little establishment for celebrations. A young couple actually got married right in the restaurant about 2 or 3 weeks ago, and celebrated there with a meal right after the ceremony. They also make arrangements for larger parties like birthdays, bridal showers and graduation. AND, they have no problem adjusting the menu to suit specific dietary needs. Some people call this place heaven. Me... I call it home!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to in Toronto! Gets an A+ for everything: food quality, selection, service and portion size. Plus, you cannot beat the reasonable prices here!  Everything at Budapest is made from scratch with delicious, fresh ingredients that just blend perfectly together. The chef is Hungarian and has consistently delivered on making traditional dishes that never disappoint. I've had both the wiener and Parisian schnitzel, which are delicious. The wiener version is more traditional while the Parisian one is fluffy and lighter. The cabbage rolls are to die for! They are so full of flavour and served with an excellent sauerkraut.   Perogies are fantastic and so is the beet salad, which I get every time. My friends ordered the special for two, which features a little bit of everything on the menu for about $20 each. We were in awe over the presentation and quantity of food. Definitely come here hungry!   Lastly, the crepe (I've had chocolate and walnut) is probably the best crepe I've ever had. For around $5, you cannot go wrong with this dessert.  I'd be amiss not mention that the co-owner - who is also a server on occasion - delivers the very best in customer service with a smile every time.   Thank you Budapest for setting a high standard for restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This little hidden gem is worth the trip no matter where you have to travel from. The food is fresh, the portions large and above all, the food will exceed all of your expectations. A simple decor but the smiles and friendliness of the staff and owners makes this little restaurant shine."}
{"text":"We were a group of 4 who had travelled to Hungary together and wanted to satisfy our craving for Hungarian food.  We decided to give Budapest Restaurants a try.  The portions are huge and food tasted amazing! We all left with very full bellies!  The restaurants seemed to be pretty popular.  It was completely full by the time we left and people were even waiting outside for a table.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I saw this place on Yelp.ca and since all the pictures and reviews looked good my husband and I visited last Sunday for lunch, We went for a \"Meat Platter for Two\". It came with cabbage rolls, sausages, schinitzel, porkchops, dumplins, beats and homemade fries, My husband is a big guy, he can eat and eat and eat but this platter was definitely for more than 2. portion was great, presentation was awesome and it tasted right. Especially their cabbage roll was so mouth watering. The place is spotless clean, the ladies working at the restaurant are attentive, very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The wines they have are from Hungary and we'd definitely come back here to try them.  Only downside for me was, parking was very hard to find."}
{"text":"So just had a terrible experience here. Ordered for pick up. The girl mistook the order couldn't hear didn't think to take the phone somewhere where she could hear.  Then charged us $50 for a side of sauerkraut. Sent soup instead of a meal.  Argued with me on the phone about spätzle.  It's dumplings not spätzle. If you knew what I meant then what is the issue? Very disappointed and frustrated.   My husband had to go back because even though they offered to have their delivery guy bring the refund and proper order the girl could not get my address right. Because she went back into the loud restaurant where she can't hear the me on the phone.  The only positive thing is that the chef did try to figure out what happened and make this right.  ****. Added note.  Hubby went back and they tried to blame him for not noticing the overcharge.  Since he had no idea what he was picking up he just assumed we ordered a lot.  What nerve.  Didn't she notice that 95$ was a lot for 2 schnitzel dinners and a soup?  So put off."}
{"text":"I'm Hungarian and this place deserves the current 4.8 stars rating. I'd give it 6/5 if I could.  I went there with a group of 6 people last night. The place has about 40 seats and has a casual atmosphere. The two servers bring out dishes with a smile even when it gets busy. Dishes arrive on time as expected (about 10 minutes).   All the dishes I had were authentic and delicious. The chicken paprikash is made with cream, not with flour and you can taste that the ingredients are carefully selected. After speaking with one of the chefs, Atilla told me they prepare everything fresh, in-house (the incredibly good strudels we're out of the oven when we arrived - they were also out of this world). The chicken thighs in this dish are cooked so well the meat just melts off the bones. Get this dish with \"uborkasalata\" (cucumber salad) to balance the rich flavours with some vinegar.  The breading of the Parisian schnitzel has a light, soft texture (made with eggs) and the regular schnitzel is as good as expected. Both are the size of my face but thin and so delicious they were gone in no time. Which, is a feat - the portions at Budapest restaurant are generous and prices are great for what you get.   My friends had the \"platter for two\" (see in photo) which is a gigantic mountain of meat, including a Parisian schnitzel, regular schnitzel, pork chop (made with mustard, the authentic way), sausage and home fries. They loved it!  To top it off, the desserts were delicious. One of the best strudels I've had (they have cherry and apple). Tried the chestnut purée, which is really what it sounds like, comes with whipped cream and some chocolate syrup and rum mixed in - a unique dessert to remember. Also try the \"somloi galuska\" or a \"kremes\" for a heavy but very traditional finish.  I'm elated to finally have a Hungarian restaurant I can wholeheartedly recommend. It was time to fill the void and I hope more of you can try our cuisine and wobble home with a smile on your face."}
{"text":"I would give it 2.5 if I could.  OK?   I finally got a chance to try this new place that got off to a checkered start: it opened last late summer, was open for maybe 6-8 weeks...then a sign on the door \"closed until January\".  They finally opened late February.   As we would often drove past while it was closed my wife and I speculated on why it could be closed so long?   What had happened?  (OK. Not writing a novel here so I will tell you this much... We never did figure out why so long.  My wife figured rat droppings in the dumplings and I more courageously defended their potential 'cause I loves me some fried meat.   Mmmm m mmmm.). Wife not crazy about Hungarian food and rat poo, this had to be a solo endeavour.    I ordered two mains.  The layup: the schnitzel dinner with dumplings.  And comfort food of sorts for me:cordon bleu.    Good news.   The food was clean!  The restaurant - which was closed remember? - was just not nice.   Not pleasant. Not warm.  Not comfy.  No rats at all on my visit.  Nada.   Glad I was doing take out still.   Food was well cooked.  Looked very nice but sparse.  Just meat and starch and a bit of sauer kraut in a strange homemade tinfoil tray.   Packing looked cheap: Bad choice in Styrofoam fold top trays.    Back to food.  Good sized hunk of meat.  Nice finish - golden brown all over.  I was so excited.  Huge huge huge schnitzel fan - remember the Corona, on Bloor, I think?  That place was IT for schnitzel.   Yum.    Now.  Getting back to THIS dish...the side - dumplings: Were very good 8/10.  Seemed homemade. Right texture. Right firmness.   Then the meat- First several bites were delicious.  I will give them that.   Lovely.  Subtle. Just salt and the lemon I squeezed on the food.  But after a few bites the quality of the meat was a bit sideways. Now much tougher and sinewy.  Carried on for the rest of the slab - and it's not fun going into each bite wondering if you are going to discover a springy mouthful of ligaments.  So the good bites were \"meh.  At least I didn't eat a rubber band\"!  and well. the bad bites were...well.  (Insert gaggy sound)   And it was the same story for number two.    Not great.   So.  You are a Hungarian restaurant - you are going to one thing really really well?  It's schnitzel!!!   Sigh.    And since it's a hole in the wall my other suggestion would be to cater to take out and delivery and narrow the menu - after you up the meat quality.   The menu is some three full (if a bit sparse) pages - remember, there are 8 or 10 seats in this place.  It is ridiculous that they have money tied up in Animal Shaped Chicken Fingers for kiddies and Regular Chicken Fingers sitting in their freezer when they are not getting the best quality of their core product from their suppliers.  OK OK OK.   I really think If they geared the menu to take out, did less, like 8 items...and did it all really really well I think they would do better.  If they want to be a restaurant they have a lot of decorating work to do.    I know these people who put their heart and souls into making that place work are working hard and are putting love into their product - it could just be so so great.   But it wasn't even \"good\" in any regard.    I was really hoping for more.    They are close by.  I will probably try them again.  If it's different I will definitely update this review.  I really wanted it to be good."}
{"text":"Oh my G-d!!! This place is a hidden gem.  The food is out of this world, but first of all the service was so amazing that I gotta mention it up ahead.  We've got certain food restrictions and we called the restaurant to make sure we can eat there.  They said that it's no problem so we came, we didn't make a reservation or leave our name -- we just came in.   So, of course, when we sat down we repeated our request.  It turned out that they had recorded what we said, and made sure that we are the people that they had talked to earlier and that they understood everything and triple checked every little thing.  It was just unbelievable -- considering that at other Hungarian places we were told that if we wish to eat their food we better eat it as they make it or not come at all.    Well -- now on to the food -- the quality was just superb.  We ordered the cold cherry soup which was lovely -- last time I'd had it in a Hungarian restaurant in Romania and this version was just as lovely as I remembered.  We also ordered the cucumber salad which was a really cool and unique dish -- I've never had a cucumber salad like that.  But the chicken breast schnitzel was what totally won me over.   The meat was so fresh and flavorfull and light and amazing!   I've never tasted schnitzel - and I was curious but a little concerned because all too many restaurants consider breading the meat as a lovely means to hide the fact that whatever animal that meat had belonged to had died a long time ago of natural causes...  But this thing was just PERFECT -- I can't wait to come back.    One thing though -- the restaurant is really small, so it's better to come early or else make reservations."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Fantastic food, friendly service and a cozy,little restaurant. Definitely can recommend the schnitzel and the goulash soup what is amazing.They give a really big portion so you won't leave hungry. I'm Hungarian and the food taste like back home."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the upper beaches. Five stars all around. Great value for your money, great and pleasant service and delicious food. Tried their Weiner schnitzel, cabbage rolls and crepes with cottage cheese for desert. Simply mouth watering and amazing. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very authentic flavor! The restaurant is cute and cozy. They have good size dishes and excellent service."}
{"text":"We love Budapest. The food is delicious, the decor is inviting and the staff are lovely. Cabbage rolls are always flavorful and fresh and the mashed potatoes are amazing."}
{"text":"Loved the food, lots of it and very tasty indeed. reasonably priced, I'm surprised its not packed all of the time"}
{"text":"Excellent flavour and authentic taste.  The dumplings are hand made daily and the cordon bleu schnitzel was full of cheese with a nice crunchy crust.  The cherry strudel was the perfect balance of sweet and tart.  With friendly and enthusiastic service, this place is a definite winner!"}
{"text":"They have delivery now. Takes under an hour and food comes nice and hot (depends on how busy the restaurant is and they will be honest with you about the time when you phone). Closed Mondays. Very good schnitzel. We like the traditional; the Parisian is an egg batter instead of breading.  Cold cherry soup is refreshing. Cabbage rolls with sauerkraut are also very good. Not a place to get burger and fries (not home made). The mashed potatoes and home fries are home-made.The pirogies are very tasty.  The beet salad and the cucumber salad are worth getting. Desserts are hit and miss - not always fresh but good when they are. Service is very friendly and helpful. Ask for the total and have change because the delivery guy tends not to have much. There is a $5 delivery fee."}
{"text":"Had late lunch. The place is pretty small but we were the only ones there. I assume the hostess/waitress was the owner and she was pleasant. My wife and I found the food uninspiring.  Complimentary bread was a few pieces of store bought rye served with butter patties.  I ordered the chicken paprikash with dumplings (spaetzel). It was two legs and a thigh smothered in a bland sauce. My wife had the cabbage rolls and mashed potatoes ( with onions mixed in). It was a generous serving and flavorful, far superior to the paprikash. For what you got, I thought it was pricey, with tax and tip $38.   Verdict - disappointing."}
{"text":"Very cute and cozy with a great selection of dishes. They have schnitzel but I usually end up with pork paprikash or mushroom stew. The pork/mushroom is always tender, meaty, and flavorful, and the nokedli (dumplings) are done perfectly - springy, slightly savory, and not floury or rubbery.  As for meats, I've only really had the Debreceni sausage, but it's definitely some 5/5 sausage. Haven't really tried the desserts but I managed to nab a bite of the Russian cream cake once and it was phenomenal.  A+ will return."}
{"text":"Food and service were really good. Not licenced yet (it's supposed to be in the mail). Unassuming little spot good for a quick dinner or hearty breakfast. Big portions. Best meal in any direction for several kms."}
{"text":"Terrific service in this cozy, clean restaurant serving some of the most delicious and authentic cuisine. We started with the Crepe (slathered in delicious gravy) and the perogis and sausage. Ended up ordering a second plate of each cause they were so good.   The Wiener Shnietzel and Cabbage Rolls were out of this world.   Bottle of white wine was tasty too and $29.   Overall very cute spot with great food, family friendly and fast."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! Honest price for a freshly done food. The plates are also very tasty and you feel like you had eaten a healthy home meal. The service also was fantastic. Big smile and very cordial. I recommend and I'm definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"I loved this little gem.  Heard about it and almost passed it as there is construction scaffolding nearby. I had perogies with sausage and coleslaw and my partner had schnitzel with spicy hunter sauce and home fries.  It was absolutely delicious.  I tried my partner's schnitzel and thought I had died and gone to heaven.  I wanted the dessert...they looked delicious but I had no room... I was so stuffed.  This is very very casual and small but well worth the visit.  Right now they only take cash but there is an ATM machine.  Our server was lovely.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The red glow of this restaurant is a beacon you should follow for a hearty meal of Hungarian comfort food. The inside is small but cosy, with only two lines of tables against the two walls. On a Thursday night, there were two larger groups tucking into goulash and cabbages rolls. I imagine this place gets busy of the weekends. The service is warm and friendly, happy to explain anything or provide recommendations.  We split a budapest platter for two, pork paprikash, and a somloi galuska for dessert between the three of us. The budapest platter starts with a large cabbage roll, generously stuffed with meat and doused with a light broth. It was one of the best cabbage rolls I've encountered. The platter itself makes an entrance to the table. Two Debreceni sausages perched on top of a Parisian schnitzel, laying on top of a larger Wiener schnitzel, balanced on top of a port chop, resting of a bed of potatoes with a cup of  beet salad and rice on each side. It's like a mini mountain with two knives stabbed through to keep it from toppling over. The presentation is impressive. My favourite from this hill of meat is the Parisian schnitzel with a bite of the beet salad. The batter is lighter and less dense but the pork is still moist.   The pork paprikash came with dumplings and a creamy sauce that mixed together perfectly. A great hearty meal even on it's own. The somloi galuska is a their version of a trifle with prominent notes of orange, raisins and plenty of whipped cream on top. A lovely little local restaurant with genuinely great food and warm service."}
{"text":"My only problem with this restaurant is deciding what to order. I've been several times and I always want the perogies or the schnitzel or the cabbage rolls.  It is a really great restaurant. Food and service are wonderful. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First of all I am part Hungarian grew up eating and learning to cook Hungarian food . The food here is delicious very traditional items on the menu have never been able to eat at a restaurant other than while visiting Hungary or food my family has made. Great service very friendly.  We ordered pork stew, cabbage rolls , cucumber salad, noodles with cabbage and several desserts everything was wonderful. A must try for anyone."}
{"text":"My friend mentioned Goulash the other day. I looked it up on yelp and found the Budapest.  We loved the Goulash and took schnitzel sandwiches to go for Mondays lunch. (Makes going to work worth it.) For desert I had the Russian cream cake, it was so light and delishous. (I'm thinking of asking them if I can buy a whole cake for when mom comes to visit) It's a cozy little place, so happy to find in the hood."}
{"text":"Amazing food and lovely service that feels like home. I highly recommend making a stop to the Budapest restaurant for a tasty treat."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  We had the platter for two - it had enough food for three.  It has a good selection of tasty selections, and our server was friendly and attentive.  Price was very reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My wife ordered the chicken sandwich based on all of the positive reviews being posted on Yelp. To say that her $12 sandwich ($8.50 plus tax and tip) was disappointing is an understatement. The sandwich looked and tasted anemic at best, and the homefries looked like they were heated up leftovers from the day before.  Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this place the second we entered it. It is a lovingly-created, simple and homey, old-school European gem! The food was authentic and the service genuine. If you want real Hungarian food, then this is the place for you. We will be back many times."}
{"text":"Amazing meats. You don't even need to decide what to order. The meat platter for two has it all!  The meat platter for two was substantial and we were expecting tons of left overs when ordering, but found it was the correct amount for my wife and I who aren't big people."}
{"text":"Best schnitzel in town, bar none.  And their dumplings?  Absolute perfection.  I have been going there since they opened.  There were a few glitches on opening (not consistent food/service).   But my oh my - now that they have expanded - wow!!!!   I've been back a few times only to be blown away at how delicious their food is.  Service is very pleasant and fast. Price is incredibly low for the quality and size of your meal.  I always have leftovers which taste just as amazing the next day.  My favourite is the Hunter Schnitzel but I was coveting my fellow diner's Cabbage Roll as I overheard her praising her dinner to her partner.  Definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Hungarian restaurant. The food is plentiful and authentic. The price is reasonable and the staff is very friendly and courteous. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Definitely coming back.  Great friendly staff and accommodating for our kids (no kids menu but have some great kid friendly food).  We ordered pierogies, goulash soup, beef tripe stew, cabbage rolls and wiener schnitzel.  For dessert we got the house-made apple strudel and the Hungarian trifle.  The food came out really quick and piping hot.  My son who has been picky of late asked about the dumplings in the goulash soup and the server brought us some extra with the gravy since she overheard he liked it and wanted more!  The tripe was tender and flavourful with the dumplings and the schnitzel was nicely breaded and didn't feel too heavy like it normally does.  The cabbage rolls are classic comfort food.  The apple strudel had a phyllo crust and a different style of filling than a German/Austrian strudel, and it was so good we had to order another one since the kids ate most of it!  It feels odd to say it but I think this place is better than the restaurants I went to when I visited Budapest (but student budget may have something to do with it).  Can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Good Hungarian wholesome comfort food meal! It's been a while since my college days when we would eat huge cheap Hungarian platters along Bloor at Bathurst. This restaurant falls in line....good, wholesome, tasty, filling, friendly service, simple clean decor and very reasonably priced. They serve from 8 am through til 8 or 9 pm daily. Dinner traditional staples; schnitzel, paprikash, goulash, cabbage rolls, dumplings all simply served, large portions and quite tasty. Dinner entrees were around $14. And fast service. What's not to like? Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing staff. Fast delivery. They have expanded. My go to place for amazing Hungarian food made fresh to order. Try them out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is quite good here.  I had the chicken shnitzel with a salad.  They were freshly made and tasty. My husband had the chicken paprikash with dumplings and had the cherry strudel for dessert.  Everything was very fresh and home made. I was surprised the restaurant was not busy at all.  We were the only ones in there.  Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This little spot has everything it needs to become a neighbourhood favourite: delicious food, friendly and helpful service, and great value. We enjoyed our Weiner schnitzel, cabbage rolls and dessert crepes, although we had some trouble deciding--the menu includes many Hungarian classics. All the dishes were carefully prepared, nicely presented and generously proportioned.   We overheard our server consulting with a potential customer about dietary challenges, and it seems both she and the chef are not only knowledgeable about assembling an appropriate meal, but also happy to adapt dishes a bit. Budapest deserves to succeed."}
{"text":"Don't give them Tips, they already included in to ur bill, as SC (service charge 15%) the food not fresh at all, I visited many Hungarian cousin in the GTA but this one is the worst. Don't waste ur money and time."}
{"text":"Food was so amazing! Went on a double date and had the budapest platter for four and it was just yunmy and so filling. Lori was just warm and sweet will def come back again! Thanks lori"}
