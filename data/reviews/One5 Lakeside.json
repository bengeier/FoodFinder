{"text":"Oh my goodness. I cannot imagine not coming here again. I've been here twice over the course of a year and have been blown away every time. The staff here has been nothing but kind.

I had the Island Burger and the Mac and Cheese and was just blown away! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and John and Laura are fantastic servers. They have bottomless mimosas on the weekends but should definitely order more cases of champagne (it'll get drunk eventually after all). Management is outdated"}
{"text":"After looking at the other reviews here, I felt the need to also throw in my own as I expierenced the same issues as others. Hopefully after enough of these reviews, the owner will take notice and actually issue some changes. We visited during the 4th of July celebration and were loking for a place to eat. After noticing the line at other restraunts, we noticed One5 that had basically its whole patio empty. We asked for a seat and we were promptly rejected, the hostess said that only the bar was avaliable even though there was clearly seating outside open. It's as if this place doesn't even want business, there were hundreds of people visiting for the night and they wouldnt even seat to their capacity. Will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"As long time locals, we see restaurants come and go often. This location is no different. However this new restaurant is now on our go to date night places. We walked in and immediately felt welcomed, and loved by the ambiance. Laura and John were absolutely amazing, with top notch knowledge of the menu's, and specials. The 1/2 price happy hour menu was superb, as well as the wine selections. This place deserves a try, and you will love it!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here last night. We didn't even know it was there. Tried to eat next door, but the wait was too long so we wandered over. John was our server, he was very attentive. Food was great. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I feel compelled to review this restaurant after the treatment we received at other places in Lake Las Vegas.  Went to this recently renamed restaurant, used to be Essence and Herbs (?), for dinner with a couple of friends late on Monday evening.  We were pleased to be shown to a table after having been told at 2 other places out here that they were already closed.  Our server was very pleasant and accommodating even though it was clear they were finishing up for the night.
Our waiter explained that they serve only prime grade steaks, all natural organic chicken and salmon, and organic produce as much as possible.  This isn't to say that their entire menu is this way, but for the health conscious \"foodie\", there's plenty of options.
We ordered a number of dishes, an appetizer of meaty crab cakes came with a spicy-sweet mayo sauce, decadent mac & cheese with truffle oil, wagyu sliders, all very tasty and reasonably priced.  Grilled salmon with a sweet vinegar cherry sauce was outstanding, cooked medium rare like we ordered.
All in all, worth the visit.  On the downside, on a hot evening they have no cooling misters AND they have NO website, we were told it's under development but for now the email and website listed on their business cards doesn't exist.  I can imagine that makes things more difficult informing people who you are, where you are and what you do."}
{"text":"We have made this steakhouse our \"go to\" place!!! Max's knowledge of wine and paring with foods is above any restaurant here in LLV!!!!

I love the relaxed atmosphere------- not 
The uptight, loud, herd you in lake cattle Way of other restaurants!!!!!

Thank you, Max---hope to see you very soon!!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here the Friday before Christmas. The area is quiet this time of year, but John offered us excellent service.  He was friendly and very attentive.  We started with the truffle Mac and cheese, which was amazing!  I had the Spicy Prawn Linguine and my husband had the Petite Filet both of which we would order again!  The filets were cooked exactly as ordered.  We were very impressed by both the service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"We ordered 14 ounces ribeye steak and sea bass. They taste so good and service was so good. There was also a piano performance. We had a very good night along the lake."}
{"text":"The village of Lake Las Vegas is beautiful. It's a shame it's not busier. One5 is right on the lake with great views. It wasn't very busy and service was incredibly slow. There was only 1 guy taking on the roles of hostess, bartender, waiter, and even helping in the kitchen. He was friendly but they need more help. 

We sat on the dog friendly patio overlooking the lake. My husband had a beef and cheddar sandwich & I had a pesto chicken with roasted tomatoes. Both were pretty good. No complaints. Prices are pretty reasonable on food and cocktails. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"Food is a little simple, but the price and ambiance make up for the loss in quality. Compared to other nearby venues they are reasonably priced and fresh."}
{"text":"The escargot is fantastic. 
Right by the lake. A great location for a date or special occasion, though my wife and I come here for no reason at all. 
Probably the best location in the village if you want a great steak."}
{"text":"Ok....so if you have 22 tables (and yes I counted them) clear and there's a line of people wanting to eat eat at your establishment then maybe you should make a dollar or two instead of saying you can't take reservations until after the fireworks ....this place is ridiculous !!!!and regardless of any events you should pay attention to your clientele rather than  shoving people off! I will never return to this place"}
{"text":"Dined here tonight, ordered the Ceviche, guacamole, & mac n cheese to share! So filling and DELICIOUS . Presentation was amazing! Our server Laura was great & attentive! Definitely coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"First impressions filled my heart!

It was my first visit to this lovely local restaurant at Lake Las Vegas.  Our friends had invited out to a place they frequent often.  We were happy to join for some HH treats.  Now, why was my heart full?  Upon talking with our waiter, the restaurant donates most of the proceeds to local charities around the Vegas area.  He went on the tell us he was actually on his way that evening to distribute some items for the homeless.  The very caring owner set up this restaurant to do exactly that...  help.  That's incredible.  The owner also has another restaurant at Lake Las Vegas which supplements One5.  Applause!

As far as our food, we started with the 2 meat 2 cheese option. They were fresh and delicious.  I always love meat and cheese starters to get my appetite brewing.  They offer a HH Brussel Sprouts dish.  It engulfed all of the roasted flavors of cranberry, blue cheese, bacon and balsamic glaze.  I would order that again.  The BLT with avocado was crisp with fresh ingredients on lightly toasted sourdough bread.  There were plenty of fries served with this sandwich.  I can't forget to mention they offer Moscato, my favorite!  And the reasonably priced bottle was a light and sweet taste in every glass. 

I'm delighted to recommend One5 and hope to return again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my birthday dinner here, the service was excellent, the atmosphere was charming. We ordered Chateaubriand for two, the chef cooked it perfectly, the sauce was divine!! Dessert came with the dinner and the server gave us champagne to celebrate. First class!!"}
{"text":"I would've have something nice about my experience at this restaurant if it wasn't for the fact that the lady at the desk when you enter in had to say something under her breath and I heard it. At around 5:45 pm on 04/29/2017, I had to use the restroom and enquired as to where it was located. I was a paying customer sitting outside the lovely restaurant.  And I referred to it as the \"bathroom\", my mistake..she corrected me under her breath as it's called a restroom. Like is that necessary??!!!  So unprofessional.  If you don't like your job and/or customer service, find another job. So rude. My mistake in coming to this restaurant and will never happen again..best to find a friendlier place to take my business too."}
{"text":"Celebrating our 32nd Anniversary. Great food and ambiance. Outdoor dining was great and the piano player was wonderful."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way back from BC as a 1/2 recommendation from a friend. We shared a wedge salad, chicken kabobs, buffalo fried chicken sandwich and the ribs. Can't really rave about any of it. The salad was drowning in dressing. The kabobs lacked any flavor whatsoever and the ribs are St Louis style, which is not really a bad thing if that's your style. The meat was fall off the bone tender but you could tell that they boiled them first. The menu quoted them as \"slow cooked\". The bbq sauce is really sub par as well. As for the sandwich, well it is like chicken fingers on a bun. We had them remake it without the buffalo sauce and it became the best thing we ate there but I really wouldn't recommend these dishes to anyone. As for the rest of the menu, I can not say but the place is really cute."}
{"text":"Ok, so here goes. The waitress is the rudest bitch I have ever dealt with. EVER!  Our table asked for more bread and she said \"I've already brought it.\"  The temperature inside the restaurant is very hot, asked waitress about it and was told \"it's not my fault.\"  If quality of service (especially given the astronomical prices here) is what you're looking for, go elsewhere. Go. Go now!  The owner of this place allegedly owns other restaurants in the area. I hope she has a good 401k, because her restaurant skills suck ass. As I type this review, I am going on 20 minutes with an empty water glass and wine glass. I'll be the bad guy because I will tip accordingly. At 30 minutes, I went to the bar and got a pitcher of water and poured water for my table and another one that had empty glasses.  The useless excuse of a waitress WATCHED THE WHOLE THING!  

The steak I had (7 oz filet was average). Brussels sprouts and pancetta was filled with very bitter sprouts. Did I mention that it was over an hour to get served in a place that was barely over half seated?  

Sweat running off my forehead and down my back, tablemate said (about the waitress) \"she's hostile!\"  Ya think???  I just poured a second round of water for my table and an adjacent one. 

No offer of another glass of wine or cocktail for ANYONE at our table. 

God forbid someone order dessert!  

This place sux all forms of ass. For the money, the distance I travelled, never again and you shouldn't either. Shame on you one5 suck ass!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, extremely disappointed in this restaurant. Was excited to see that they were doing a weekend brunch and drove to Lake Las Vegas specifically for their brunch with a few friends. After the server telling us at 10:40 that they were running behind and wouldn't be able to serve brunch, our group left and the next day I called to ask what the issue was. The manager was immediately defensive and condescending in describing why they were running 40 minutes behind schedule. Would have been happy to have been seated and have a drink or two while they caught up. For a seemingly new restaurant and location, they don't seem overly eager for people to have positive experiences. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Place was ok. Food was bland. I ordered chicken milanesa and chicken was bland, mashed potatoes had no taste and steamed veggies are steamed vegetables. I liked the fact that they had a kids menu, but kids thought tenders stunk fishy. This place was so so"}
{"text":"Great breakfast,  had the avocado toast.  Potatoes are good too.  Nice decor,  have an outside patio with views of the lake.  Great service. Offer bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"16$ angus burger looked like a previously frozen small patty. It was so charred and burnt i couldnt taste it. Tomatoes were pale. The waiter served it anyway. 2 stars for the view"}
{"text":"Stopped in this past Saturday night on a whim with friends and glad we did! 
We originally sat on the patio, there was great weather, but when the band started playing on the lake it was tough to have a conversation. So we asked to move inside and we did. Dining room has a very nice atmosphere. 
We ordered some appetizers and our entrees. Two ordered the Sea Bass, one a steak and I did the lobster roll. 
The Sea Bass was cooked perfectly (so glad I took a bite) My girlfriend said her steak was delicious. However my lobster roll, was not what I expected. It was more like a lobster salad roll. I don't believe it was fresh lobster and it was mixed with things to be more like a tuna salad. However it was served on a roll that was topped with slaw, way more than the lobster salad. It came with a side of chips that came out of a bag so I was not to impressed. Most importantly it lacked flavor. The drinks were great. I enjoyed their red sangria. 
Nice atmosphere, great service and I'll order the Sea Bass next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I saw a sign (right outside their doors) that stated this place did brunch from 10-3 on the weekends. We were excited for an new brunch spot to try, we went back the very next day with some friends. Only to be disappointed when they told us they were \"running behind\", and to \"come back in 30 minutes.\" We did, only to again be disappointed when they informed us it would \"still be awhile.\" Don't advertise to be open when you're not. Since we were hungry, we left to go elsewhere. Won't bother coming back since they clearly did not want us there."}
{"text":"I decided to write my review after reading all the negative ones. First thing I gotta say is what a bunch of whiny ass people. My family and friends have eaten here 3 outta 4 Saturday nights for the better part of 4 months. We've also attended several private events there. 

Now do we like everything on the menu? No, but we have discovered many more things we like than ever disliked. We have never had bad or spoiled food and the staff has always been helpful with suggestions. 

We had a great night on the 2nd. Sat outside and watched the fireworks. Was it hot out? Yeah it's Vegas and it's July... Its's hot inside? OK they had A/C issues - Remind me never to invite you to my house when the A/C is broken. Rude staff?  I've been waited on by everyone that works there. No complaints. Laura and John especially bust their butts. 

This has turned a little less of a review and a statement about what a self absorbed group of people have become. You have one bad experience and you can't wait to run to Yelp, Facebook and Twitter and scream to the world about how you have been wronged and how who wronged you will be punished because you told the world. Move on.

Now back to the food - rib appetizer, wedge salad, seafood fried rice, truffled mac and cheese - all awesome!  Like I said earlier - been there over a dozen times and still going back!"}
{"text":"The view and service is really great. The French onion soup is also killer.

 The crust on the tuna was charred, had to pick it off. Don't buy the red sangria, is like grape water.

The extra plate was filthy, my wine glass was chipped, and I was served the wrong drink, or rather, screwed up a drink recipe but they \"fixed it\"

Overall I'll go back, because it's cheap, our waiter was so nice and the view is awesome."}
{"text":"Was suppose to open at 2 didn't start serving food until 4:30. Apparently nobody knew how to keep the grill lit. Waites 45 for my burnt burger. My cheeseburger was like eating burnt toast with cheese. Accepted cash only so it cost another $3.50. 2 burnt cheeseburgers and a coke 19.50 crazy for shit food."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant with another person and both ordered Lobster Tails.  I ate one bite........and noticed the tail smelled like it was rotting so I flipped it over and it was BLACK!
The second tail was mushy in consistency and tasted just ok. The black tail was sent back and I was given a shy reluctant apology asking if I wanted anything else.  Ummm no lol. The chief here is not Culinary trained.  No real chief would let a tail leave the kitchen that smelled like that.  And it's obvious the tails are not being stored properly and are expired.  
I'm a local I drive a golf cart down and I can say without a doubt this restaurant will not survive.  Celine Dion lives in this community and they are serving Bad shellfish? Girl bye lol. Btw I'm pregnant.  Hoping that I don't get food poising now and I have already called my doctor ..... he has informed me that I am probably going to get bacterial food infection in the next 12 hours and in rare cases it does affect the baby. Like wow"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Kudos to the chef! The menu offers a nice variety of dishes. There are some great wine pairings to go with your dish. The atmosphere is so warm and cozy for date night. The building is situated lakeside and you can dine on a lovely covered patio. Lastly, the service is always great!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why all the bad reviews at this great place. I really enjoyed the dining experience and food here. I came with a party of four and we all loved everything! 

The crab bisque is soooo delicious, one of the best soups I have had in a while. All the other small plates were tasty too. 

The rib eye was cooked as ordered and flavorful. Dessert was also delicious. The only fail was my cappuccino, but the waiter apologized and took it off the bill without hesitation. 

Service was five stars, but we were only one of three tables there so that's pretty hard to screw up. 

I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This is an update to my recent, previous review, and an update that I truly wish I wouldn't have to write. While I could have just left things alone, it wouldn't be fair to other Yelpers, as this restaurant didn't leave things alone. 

They changed their menu completely, and the food quality also has suffered. 

My wife and I used to love going here on weekends for brunch and occasionally during the week for dinner. Sadly, we will not return.

I pressed on my wife for us to take our guests there this morning, fully expecting the same caliber of food we have enjoyed EVERY time before. My wife wanted to stay home and for us to enjoy a wonderful meal and drinks in our lovely home, all comfy, cozy, and chill. Nope. We went to One5Lakeside and saw a completely different menu than our previous visits, my favorite grilled chicken sandwich is gone and the chef wouldn't prepare it. The French Fries we loved, because they were the thin, crispy, Pomme Frites like we have enjoyed at some excellent French Restaurants, have been replaced by double-baked fries akin to Burger King. Yucky, lacking any flavor other than the oil they were fried in, and put an aftertaste in my mouth that I would prefer not to share or explain. 

Our favorite waiter was there and served us, and still wonderfully friendly and accommodating. He even mixed a custom margarita for me that tasted fantastic. It's because of John, our regular waiter, that I'm giving 2 stars, otherwise this place has slid so much in quality they would deserve 1 star.

The food was good before. Very good. However, it appears few patrons fully appreciated the quality, the flavors, and the textures. Now with their new menu and mediocre tasting food, the place is busy and seemingly successful. What does this tell us? It can only be assumed that the area patrons desire mediocre food and have no appreciation or understanding of quality. Sad! Really sad, and especially for Lake Las Vegas. However, no surprise as everyone in LLV that I've asked for recommendations on pizza, Mediterranean, and Mexican food has all proven to be bland, boring, and poor quality overall. Thus, I can see why these people now love and praise the food at One5Lakeside. Ugh! Missing really flavorful foods prepared with passion and flare. 

Previous review:

My wife and I have been to this nice restaurant maybe 5-6 times in the past year, and love it!

John is such a nice and attentive waiter, friendly and entertaining. He's served us all but once when we visit. The manager is also attentive and aware, and she cares about making her patrons feel welcome. However, as much as we love the staff, it's about the food, right! Well, food and drink as my wife really enjoys their bottomless mimosas during weekend Brunch. 

We've tried dinner there 1-2 times. Good and tasty food. Small plates so order many to try and share.
Brunch is our fav there, however. Okay, not only because of the mimosas! My wife gets a conventional eggs, bacon, toast breakfast and I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich which is bursting with flavor and never over cooked and dry, and it also comes with awesome fries! In fact, it's even worth ordering fries ala cart for spud lovers!

Looking forward to this establishment changing hours of operation during the week to open at 11am
Instead of 4pm! This means we will be visiting more often."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, the previous TAPAS place was not as good. We are vegan/vegetarian and had a great meal: vegetable risotto, vegan lentil soup's, sautéed mushrooms and quinoa tabouli w/ pitas.  The last dish, was the only one I would not repeat. It just wasn't for me. My husband did like it though. The waiter was excellent. I think they need a new host/hostess.  The current older gentleman didn't seem like he really wanted to be there. We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"My family ate here on the first night of our vacation. Yes, it's on the pricy side but all our meals were prepared perfectly and delicious. I had the filet-minion...I wished I could have it for every meal. My husband had the salmon and said it was wonderful. The bread with the fresh butter and olive purée (tapenade) was a new item for our pallet and it scored high with the kids. 

The cheesecake was a fluffy dream, I wish I had room for a second piece. 

The service was prompt, polite and professional."}
{"text":"Rude and unaccommodating staff that seem to prefer an empty restaurant. Happy to help them keep it that way."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to One5 Lakeside and I was sooo excited! 

I've heard nothing but how good this place WAS. 
I ordered an Avocado BLT that was mostly thick slices of tomatoes(for height I presume) and only 1.5 slices of bacon?! I questioned myself when John our waiter placed the plate in front me because it was just messy and the fries looked like they were fried twice in a fryer...just saturated in grease.
Needless to say my dissatisfaction level matched my excitement level by the time we left."}
{"text":"As the \"Duchess\" of One5Lakeside I am sad to say that this restaurant has changed in a bad way.  The first thing I noticed is that the person that sat us was not friendly or outgoing. I'm pretty confident this is the new manager.  I called the restaurant a few weeks ago right before they were having a grand opening and I spoke with him.  This sounded like the same person.  Had I never eaten here before I would have just walked out because he does not have an inviting demeanor.

The menu has changed.  I was entirely unaware of this before we visited today.  We were here at brunch time but there was only one eggs option.  It was a Denver scramble or omelet.  I didn't care. I didn't want it.  The food quality is not as good and the portions were considerably smaller.  I ordered plain fries (that I've ordered every visit before) and they were double coated like they sell at Burger King.  I am not a fan of this style of potatoes. I got about 15 total pieces. The fries I had a month ago were not the puffy, coated variety.  They were delicious.  I was a huge fan of the fries.  

On this trip I brought 2 other people and my husband, my normal eating companion.  The only thing we are used to ordering that was still on the menu was the calamari.  This was more onions than seafood.  There was a strange sauce that I didn't even bother to try.  It looked like a mix of thousand island and ketchup.  

I didn't take pictures of anything.  I was underwhelmed.  I'm currently eating Fritos as I am not at all satisfied.

Update to my update- - - - 
Hubby and I are here again during the Mardi Grad festival.  I forgot to write about our experience at AYCE dinner a few Thursdays ago.  The $15 cost is a steal.  We had some truly delicious pasta, cooked al dente.  This was the highlight of my meal.  I love pasta.  It actually filled me up.  I tasted the ribs. They were tender and delicious.  Great rub.  I wish I had more room in my tummy to eat more of them.  Laura was my server.  Super sweet and friendly.  I believe she's also the manager.  The all you can eat menu changes so don't get mad at me if they don't have ribs.  Call first.  I did! Laura told me what was in the menu for the night and it sounded good so I came do

Update----- 
My second trip for brunch was even better than the first.  John remembered us and put us at our original table.  That was so cute.  He is a great conversationalist and great with customer service.  

Our meal was excellent.  I tried the Chinese Chicken salad even though I really wanted eggs.  This salad was massive and filled with fun.  Haha!  They included fresh ginger and seaweed.  I like
The flavor or seaweed and actually have a huge pack of seaweed snacks that I munch on at home.  If you don't like seaweed or fishy then just ask them to not add this.  Otherwise, I don't think anyone could not enjoy this meal.  They're was also an ample amount of well seasoned chicken and walnuts.  Nice addition for texture and flavor

I really enjoyed by brunch here this past weekend.  The bottomless mimosas were a happy bonus.  Me and mimosas are besties! 

I ordered the basic American breakfast with 2 eggs, sausage, potatoes and a side of fruit.  The eggs were perfectly scrambled to my liking which is not wet.  I hate when they barely seem cooked and they are slimy.  Not at all, and they had added seasoning.  Not tons, but some.  My sausage was also cooked the right way.  I get leery eating gray sausage that seems pink inside.  That is a sure way to get sick.  The breakfast potatoes were crispy brown and salty (not too much). And I was given toast though it wasn't listed in the description.  That was a happy surprise.  I can't comment on the freshness of the fruit because it was Honeydew melon and I truly hate the taste of that particular fruit.  Not their fault.  It looked fresh though.

John, our server, was attentive and made the perfect mimosa.  He knows his ratios.  He would bring a new glass by as soon as I took the last sip. John is on my list of potential future besties just because of this.  

I also ordered coffee because I had my toast to munch on.  I was particularly hungry when we got there because I hadn't had breakfast so I kept going.  The coffee was fab!  I asked John what it was and believe it or not, it was good old fashioned Folgers coffee from way back when.  He said he always uses two scoops to brew it.  If my Nespresso at home gives out I'm getting two scoops of Folgers and moving on with my life."}
{"text":"Excellent food.. happy hour.. the porch view is amazing.. and the server Laura was absolutely the best!!"}
{"text":"One5 Lakeside is one of the best breakfast locations I've been to in the Las Vegas area. This restaurant is very clean, chic and in a very pleasant location right on the water.

My family was here for a family brunch and we very much enjoyed our meal. The servers were great and also very prompt and friendly. Prior to being seated, glasses full of water were already on the table. We also had a customized menu set for our family reunion. The owner, Chanthy was a pleasure to work with in our last minute trying to find a location for brunch for our group. 

The food was amazing. My families from Tahiti, New Zealand and many other states here in the US all had good things to say about the restaurant. 
The salmon, omelettes, sandwiches and all were so good, we found ourselves picking from each others plates. LOL. 

Overall, I'm bummed I was so busy I didn't get pics of the food, but I did manage to snag a picture of some of us in front of the restaurant :D 

I'd highly recommend booking here if you have a large party. They will definitely take care of you! :)"}
{"text":"Sadly, service was less than stellar.   Left to go somewhere else.   Perfect location and they could do great if they didn't treat customers like they were a burden."}
{"text":"It was my wife's and my 4th anniversary. it was over 100F in the restaurant. I was uncomfortable the entire time.  I asked if they could turn up the A/C and they said it wasn't hot. I probably sweat less at the gym. The food was terrible overpriced and I found a dead fly in my meal. I left in a hurry to try to avoid vomiting everywhere. You wont catch me dead in that place again. DIRTY DINING 911!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here once or twice now.  The food is very good and tasty.  The service was up to par also.  I look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"I consider Lake Las Vegas the hidden gem of Las Vegas . I love it down here . Normally I would go to another restaurant down here (not naming names) but the service is crap. I am so glad that there is a restaurant down here with great service and a solid happy hour seven days a week. This has become my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Food was not great. My burger was burnt. My husband burger was rare when he asked for well done.  Instead of them remaking the burger it seemed as though the put it in the microwave. Chicken kabob was great."}
{"text":"Totally excellent.   Wonderful atmosphere - whether you opt to sit inside is the very cool dining room, or outside on their patio overlooking Lake Las Vegas, it is beautiful.   Great service, and the food is to die for.  Fantastic small plates - my favorite was the crab corn bisque, and also loved the scallops.  Looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Laura was the best server ever! They accommodated our larger group in 2 tables on their great patio. The ribs were to die for, lobster sauce was incredible, prices were reasonable, they were so agile and accommodating. I can say for our group and our week and lots of outings, this place was the best. Lake Las Vegas isn't booming - but it should be and we believe it is growing. However this fact is why it was ok for 6 families, seeking warm weather, and lake Las Vegas Village, offseason was just fine. We had realistic expectations and they were more than met. Thank you Laura and Nick and chef team! We will be back!!  Yum!!"}
{"text":"We love tapas and found their Thursday specials to be very good!  The setting over looking Lake Las Vegas is lovely this time of year.  Wine was good and half price on this night.  Will go again!"}
