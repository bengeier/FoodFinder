{"text":"Dined here last night with my husband and was very impressed.  We both had the lent fisherman's platter and it was very good.  It  was a fried fish and seafood platter with a generous portion and very tasty.  The hamburgers looked delicious and we will try nexr time.  The beer was very good and the service was very good The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and is very clean.  We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Good service. Food was very reasonably priced. Nice selection of specials. Food was delicious! Great local craft beer selection! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Below average bar food with average at best service. We ate on the bar side with one waitress. It was cold and the waitresses had a lot on her hands so it wasn't very good. The food was where it really missed the boat. I had a burger that was okay but I wouldn't order again. Not a single person with us had anything memorable.  I want to like it but I can't imagine i will be back to try again."}
{"text":"Bad deal here got chicken rap chicken Ice cold. Sent it back net time out spotted hot and cold. FF were hot . I don't know place is suppose to be ok. 12.00 for draft beer and Bad chicken rap FF but the fries were hot. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx      Xxxxxxxx they want me to keep writing"}
{"text":"Ate ate the bar with a friend.  Better beer options than many standard sports bar.  My Philly steak was fresh off the grill and fries were piping hot out of the fryer.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"Closed, for good it looks like.  Been closed for awhile now. Was in one of the oldest buildings in Cuyahoga Falls.  For some reason, food at this location was not very good, which explains why it is closed.  Overpriced for bar food and just not very good considering nearby options and the Rockne's that was here at one time."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and decor. Wide arrange of options on menu. I had grilled chicken salad. It had a good blend of greens and was tasty. My husband had a wrap and son had chick parmesan. Nice size portions. We all needed a box to go."}
{"text":"When is this place open???  I stopped for lunch in April when the OPEN sign was lit and there were cars in the parking lot and the steps were shoveled, only to wrench my wrist on the door handle which was locked when I tried to open it.    Remembering the amazing french fries (my husband and I love crispy, thick fries) we have returned numerous times for dinner.  Unless the owner is cooking in the kitchen, the food seems to be sub-par.  We often end up at Treichel's on Wednesday nights, which is Karaoke night.  This is a busy night for this establishment, however this is not a good night to watch sports or enjoy a nice meal.  I don't hold high hopes for this restaurant unless they make great profits based on weekend nights or Wednesday night Karaoke money."}
{"text":"In the old Rocknes location. Pretty good food for a reasonable price. Portions are pretty large, particularly on the burgers. Restaurant on one side with a bar area on the other. Gas station / service garage themed. Be sure to check out the motorcycle encased as a table on the bar side!"}
{"text":"The soup was home made and excellent!  The fries were cooked perfect...no greasiness !  Everything we ordered was fantastic.  The martinis were made to order; the olives were even hand stuffed with blue cheese.  The decor is very inviting, and the whole restaurant is CLEAN and spotless....a big change from the establishment that was here previously.  It's obvious that this owner really cares about his business and clients!"}
{"text":"Hmm, I don't know where I stand with this place... It's been hit or miss but I will say their burgers are delicious & their onion rings aren't greasy. Aside from that, everything is just ok. The interior isn't my thing with sports-car theme. A theme doesn't turn me away but there just wasn't any getting away from it. The bar is so loud and is very annoying in the dining room. Visited three times and probably won't go back unless my BFF calls and wants to meet for a burger. She and I get two different ones & split them. So, it's always good company and the rest is, just ok.   Good for kids & closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We took the whole family and it was affordable and tasty. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the restaurant in any way.  The service was horrible and the food was ok.  Nothing to write home about at this establishment."}
{"text":"Excellent Bloody Mary's. The fries are really good; perfectly crisp. Good beer selection. He got the Reuben which was very good & I got a grilled cheese with tomato & pickles. Very laid back atmosphere & comfortable. Prices are reasonable and staff was very friendly & make you feel at home. The only thing missing from the menu is wings."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a pint. Good beer selection. I was a little confused on the decor. There were too many themes going on."}
