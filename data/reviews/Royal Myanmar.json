{"text":"Fantastic Food, great service! 

This was our first time at Myanmar Cuisine. Foot at Royal Myanmar is really good. We tried some Sushi, Different Appetizers and couple of entrees and found everything really good. 

We had never tasted Fried Tofu this well! Samosa and Chicken Satay were really good! Basil Chicken was our favorite main course. 

All the food seemed to have been cooked really healthy. Very less oil, fresh ingredients. Multiple options for lower carbs diets as well. 

If you are looking for an upscale elite decor place, this is not the one for you. But best bang for your buck from the friendly people with healthy and fresh food, search no more!"}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out for their sushi. I got a spicy tuna roll and the mynamar roll. They go extremely heavy on the \"special sauce\" they put on top of the rolls. So much so that I found myself scraping it off because it was too excessive. I've always read that if a place overloads on the sauce, the sushi underneath is probably not that great."}
{"text":"A no frills local restaurant with excellent, delicious food. They offer both traditional Burmese food as well as a pan Asian-American menu and sushi. Great for both take out and a casual sit down meal"}
{"text":"Nothing high end to make you go out of your way but half the price of sesame inn and same quality. Our local sushi go to!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've only recently discovered it even though it is right in my neighborhood. I've had 3 different dishes so far and believe it or not each one is not only excellent but some of the best food I've ever tasted. I would  definitely put this restaurant on your must try list. Don't be put off by the lack of decor but get ready for the friendliest service and the best tasting food you've ever had!  Try the curry. I had the chicken and potato curry it was awesome."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great. One of the best places around. The staff is super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"This is probably my fav food place in Pittsburgh. The food was so delicious and scrumptious. I would definitely stop by again"}
{"text":"Holy heck, I love this place. My fiancé and I were a little thrown off when we walked in. It's small and very quiet and only one other person was inside eating. So glad we decided to stay! The service is fast(so fast) and the food is good. Side note, Thai iced tea is AMAZING. 
I stayed with sushi and my fiancé got a basil chicken dish. Not disappointed at all. 
We just moved into the area a month ago and have already made a second trip! Don't let the outside fool you, it hides between a karate place and a laundry mat and the long blinds hide the inside. 
Recommend."}
{"text":"So I will start with what they need to work on. The lights. We are eating dinner, not breakfast, where we need the lights so bright we can read the newspaper. Turn them way down and you are there, as the food is marvelous!!!  We took a couple of bottles of wine. I order the dragon and rainbow rolls. Excellent!! I asked for a garlic fish sauce for dipping and no problem!  My hubby's pad thia was decadent!!  Our friends pork with peanut sauce was as well. I will go back even if they don't turn the lights down, but this is such a simple way to make your restaurant special. Please do it!!"}
{"text":"With all the good reviews, I had to try this place.  I started out with the spring rolls.  They gave me six of them. They were fresh and very good dipped in a sweet peanut sauce. The salads were nice and cold and crisp with a ginger dressing.  I had the spicy basil beef with peppers, mushrooms and cilantro in a great sauce served with brown rice.  We also had a shrimp dish that was like shrimp fried rice but with noodles.  It was great too!
Good size portions, everything fresh and tasty!  Oh....and the Thai iced tea!  OMG it reminded me of a White Russian!  No wonder I sucked it down!  It was fantastic!  If you like Burmese food, a little Thai, Indian and Chinese dishes, you will love this place.  The place is small, not fancy but very reasonable prices. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh. You can tell that the cooks go above and beyond making the food, it's maybe the most flavorful Asian food I've ever had. The presentation is simple and clean, and so is the interior of the restaurant - nothing to distract you from the food.

When I first went I ordered samosas to start and the beef and pumpkin curry. Definitely the best samosas I've ever had, ultra crispy and bursting with flavor. The beef was tender and seasoned to perfection. Since then I've ordered a couple other things off the menu and it's all excellent. I haven't tried it but I've heard their sushi is good too!

The service is fast and friendly and the prices are incredibly reasonable for such well made food. If you haven't tried this restaurant I highly recommend you do so!"}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly and the food was phenomenal!  I ordered the crunchy roll and the west view roll and they were so good!  10/10 would eat again"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place after Slippery Mermaid said they were done seating people at 8:30pm on a Friday evening. So glad they did because the sushi here was some of the best I've ever eaten. We ordered a sushi platter and got a delicious sample of sushis. 38 pieces for only 30.00. The rainbow roll was so fresh and made to perfection. The staff was super friendly and stayed to talk to us after our meal. This hidden gem will be a place I will most certainly be frequenting. Only had sushi but their menu is extensive and impressive as well. Add this to your go to place!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a hidden gem! I became very fond of Burmese food while living in Washington DC and was very excited to find this restaurant here in Pittsburgh. Although it wasn't on the menu, the chef prepared a delicious Nan Gyi Thoke for me - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Asian restaurant! Not too Americanized so food is fresh and healthy! They have Burmese and Thai dishes and a sushi bar if you're craving sushi. Ordered the  Myanmar combo sampler - chicken satay was amazing, crispy tofu was perfect and the samosas the best I've ever had. For entrees, the chicken Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw was good (think peanut-less pad Thai with chick peas) and the Spicy Basil Beef was delicious. Huge menu, we'll be back to try and sample everything. 
They gave us a free soup and salad since we ate in - 
Finished with mango sticky rice - which was legit (mango was amazing). Support them so we can keep this gem in the area!"}
{"text":"Went there after seeing high ratings. Location is not easily accessible  unless you live in the area. Was disappointed unfortunately. Wait time was long despite only one other family seated , food was very ordinary and bland. Tofu was dripping in oil. We tried the chicken on stick and chicken coconut curry. It felt re heated and Probably Not fresh. Only liked their samosas and the sauce. Service while slow was very nice. Only one person was serving food to the whole place. It was Friday night but about 1/3 capacity full. 

For someone who is not familiar with authentic Burmese/Indian style food, it may work. Because of the location, quality of food and wait times, will not be going there again. 

You can't say now that no one warned you !"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great prices and portions. My favorite dish is the spicy basil fried rice and I ask for the heat to be about a 6, which is perfect! The sushi is great too.  I can't wait to order more, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi. Excellent customer service. Amazing prices! We will be regulars. I can't believe we waited so long to try them out. Ashamed to say we live right around the corner. 
We had the tempura shrimp, the spicy tuna, and a chicken coconut curry. Perfect."}
{"text":"I am so pleased to give the Royal Myanmar my 
5-star review.  Don't let the modest decor fool you!  The cuisine at this little restaurant is packed with delightful flavors. We began with appetizers, including the Fresh & Crispy Spring Rolls and the Sampler Platter, which included Chicken Satay, Crispy Tofu and Samosa, all of which were fresh and delicious and were accompanied by flavorful sauces.  We were all very pleased with each meal; once again, the flavors were just wonderful. We enjoyed them all:  Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw, Spicy Basil Fried Rice, Lemongrass Beef w/Coconut Rice and Kyarzan Kyaw.  I thoroughly recommend this diamond-in-the-rough as a must-try."}
{"text":"I have had lunch here around a dozen times. Food is amazing. Tried something different every time.  You can't go wrong. Have not tried the sushi yet. Atmosphere is a little sparse but service and meals are out of this world. If you are looking to try Burmese cuisine give Royal Myanmar a try."}
{"text":"Hi.. I am the waitress here at Royal Myanmar! And I believe that our food here is the best Asian food in Pittsburgh. If you like authentic Asian food this is the place for you! We have Thai, Burmese, some Chinese, and Japanese (sushi). Everything here is fresh, you get big portions for your money, and the chef's here put their heart and soul in to what they love to do.. which is cook for you. It's about time we've got something new in West View.. come and check us out you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant. But, Great food. I ordered fish curry. They start cooking when I ordered. Very fresh taste. Tea leave salad was amazing. Yes, TEA LEAVE SALAD. Real TEA leave that you can eat."}
{"text":"I could eat here every day.  The sushi is phenomenal (try the West View roll!), and the rest of the menu is very authentic and tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place. Tasty fresh sushi and excellent service and a beautiful presentation."}
{"text":"Never expected to find a legit Burmese place in Pittsburgh. So happy to see a place that offers different kind of Burmese noodle that I haven't ever tried - boiled egg noodle with chicken, rice vermicelli soup with meatball and quail eggs, and I also got the stir fried egg noodle with pork. My drive from my hotel all the way on the southern suburbs, passing all the traffics, was totally worth it! I'll come back to try the dishes next time."}
{"text":"I ordered take out on Memorial Day, which was seemingly hard to find since it's a holiday and many restaurants weren't offering take out besides pizza places. 

I ordered the dragon Rolland 8 piece sashimi combo. 
Everything was very delicious and the fish was fresh. I was delighted with my food. It was well worth it!

Thank you so much for the tasty lunch"}
{"text":"Hard to believe this place is a block from our house and we didn't even know it. Now we're going to have a problem with access to good sushi and Thai food on a daily basis.

Started with the typical house salad with ginger dressing - much more flavorful ginger than most Chinese restaurants.

Followed up with two sushi rolls: rainbow and west view roll, perfectly prepared and both $10.

For entrees I had the spicy basil chicken and my wife had the coconut curry with LARGE portions of chicken breast. Excellent portion sizes and absolutely delicious. Ordered a 7 on the spice scale and it was perfect for me - enough to make my nose run.

Needless to say it's a hidden gem in West View."}
{"text":"We just came back from a vacation to Myanmar and we were excited to try this place and see how it compared. This place is the real deal! We had the ohnno kauk swe and it was the best thing since returning for myanmar! The pickled tea leaf salad which is a staple in Myanmar was good though the density of cabbage to pickle leaves probably reflects the price of importing pickle leaves. This place is definitely a 5+ Star! We will be back tomorrow for lunch!"}
{"text":"After spending an artful morning in Millvale, we looked on our nifty Yelp for somewhere unique to eat for a late lunch.  Royal Myanmar popped up as a ten to fifteen minute drive - it immediately caught our interest after having watched a couple of documentaries on the country of Myanmar and reading about its politics in recent news articles on NPR.  It was an easy drive with convenient parking, and we were greeted with very nice service - the waitress seemed equally as appreciated with us as customers as we were with the food!  A nice, quiet setting to enjoy some talk with a friend over some unique and exotic cuisine.  We ordered the Royal Myanmar tea, which was very delicious, and quite essential for a cold day.  We also ordered the sampler appetizer, but substituted it with three fried green squash and three tofu, as we didn't want meat and they were out of samosa at the time.  The appetizer was served with a very tasty sweet and spicy dipping sauce.  I ordered the pickled tea leaf salad (as I had heard it is a very good traditional Burmese specialty with all the right balanced eats from herbs to veggies to crunchies) and my boyfriend ordered the drinking noodles with chicken.  The salad was like nothing I've ever had before and was very tasty!  It had a salty and savory flavor; a sufficient yet lighter meal, which I enjoy.  The drinking noodles are awesome according to my boyfriend; a good mix of savory sauce with the addition of bitter vegetables.  We very much enjoyed our time at Royal Myanmar - they have great what I assume to be more culturally traditional brass band music playing, creating a nice atmosphere for a calm, lighthearted afternoon outing.  Again, the service was absolutely amazing - I definitely recommend this unique eatery to anyone with an open mind and passion for Asian food and culture."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to visit Royal Myanmar based on earlier reviews. We are so glad we did. I had really fresh sushi and my husband chose the chicken fried rice, which was very tasty. Both of us enjoyed the miso soup which was the best I've had. We plan to return to try other menu items. So many!!"}
{"text":"Great food! We had the fried rice and the house special
Noodle soup - both very good with a unique and authentic flavor that we've not had other places. We will be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Maybe more of a 3 or 3.5-star, but I'll round up to 4 for being the only Burmese restaurant in Pittsburgh. (RIP Burma-Tokyo.) I'd say this place has Burmese food on par with Philadelphia, but not on part with Southeast Asia. In particular, the tea leaf salad and the pork with pickled mango were both very tasty, but the flavors didn't come through as strongly as they might have. Stir-fried noodles (I don't remember what exactly) were unmemorable. Chickpea tofu was really strange, but in the best possible way."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times and both times were very good. I would highly recommended the sushi to anyone. I was also very surprised and happy when I learned there was 10 pieces per roll. Very good overall quality"}
{"text":"Great food and very nice owners. Wish they didn't mix the noodles with the soup when ordering to-go as they were soggy."}
{"text":"I stopped by for some quick noodles to go and was delighted by how tasty the food is! I will definitely be back, delicious."}
{"text":"I knew nothing about Burmese cuisine so I was pretty excited to hear that there was a Burmese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Thanks Kristina P. for putting it on my radar!

Anyway, the restaurant is not fancy and it's pretty much like any other Asian restaurant: white walls with functional, rather than decorative, tables and chairs, little to no decor. The menu looked to be a mix of Burmese, Japanese, Chinese, and Thai. There were no distinctions so we had to ask the owner which dishes were Burmese and she was incredibly helpful. We ordered the Royal Myanmar Combination Sampler to start, I got the Ohn-no Kauk Swe (Chicken noodle soup with coconut milk) and the hubby got the Coconut Chicken Curry. My favorite part of the sampler was the samosas. They were filled with a potato and onion filling which carried a slight curry flavor. They had what seemed to be a spring roll wrapper as the outer shell so it was crunchy on the outside and soft and comforting on the inside. Our entrees were very comforting and rich, making them great items to order on a cold fall or winter day. Flavors were mild too, as in not at all spicy. 

Overall, I would come back to give other Burmese menu items a try!"}
{"text":"Trust me - this is The Best Sushi in the North Pittsburgh area.  We used to go weekly to Cranberry's Taipei (Jimmy Wan's).  And we do enjoy the atmosphere of the Slippery Mermaid in Sewickley.  However, NOTHING compares to the fresh and thoughtful sushi at Royal Myanmar.  We have ordered platters for parties, dined in, and we take out weekly.  The portions are generous for the price - Taipei in Cranberry is serving fractions of the amount of food, and charging well over Royal Myanmar's prices.  This place is SO worth the visit!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious every time!  Their spice level could be higher but great tasting food."}
{"text":"Sushi was fantastic! Didn't expect to like it so much. And the prices are great too! I'll be back soon to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Good service. Had small sushi plates. Just the right size sushi bite. Reasonably priced. Will try Burmese next time."}
{"text":"Yet another delicious visit to Royal Myanmar. This time, we dive right into this amazing plate of sushi featuring three rolls and 10 pieces of nigiri (of your choosing). Wowzers! It was so good and at $40?! Best value in this area. We had to have that addictive samosa thoke again. So unique and flavorful. Love it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must-try! The food is phenomenal. Everything is well made with the utmost care. We had the sampler platter, Thai tea, and sushi. The staff was so kind. We felt bad after getting there on the later side (930pm), but she reassured us there were no worries. Excellent server. Took Mango rice dessert home - still too stuffed from all the awesome to try it yet! I'm not super good at reviews, but I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The food here reminds me a lot of Thai food. We asked the server, who was telling us her story of being a refugee, which dishes were traditional Burmese dishes. She grabbed the owner for us, who is very warm and amiable. She recommended several dishes, after which I got the Lemongrass beef stew that comes with a side of coconut rice. It was very tasty. My partner got the thick rice noodle dish with chicken, and it was also good. I ordered a Thai iced tea and it was the biggest I have ever seen!  Which I was very happy about because usually they are mostly ice. Overall, very satisfying.  The service was good, food was good."}
{"text":"I went in and got some sushi to go.  They were extremely nice and helped me through the menu.  The presentation was great and was served on one platter to take home.  The food was really good and I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I don't judge a book by it's cover when it comes to Asian restaraunts, but maybe I should start.  This place is very drab looking from the outside in.  It was also very cold when we were there, so I wanted to leave very soon after we ate for fear of freezing to death.  The lady that served us was very nice, but the food was nothing to write home about.  We both had stomach aches and had indigestion after eating there.  My gf had the only vegan menu item, which was their curried vegetable plate.  I had some of it and it was very bland.  I couldn't taste any of the curry spices at all.  I would like to say that I would try it again, but I really don't think I would drive to West Veiw again for their food.  Especially when there are so many restaraunts with the same kind of food, but much better quality and taste.  Also, the problem is that I don't eat sushi and I am not that into seafood as well."}
{"text":"Ordered some chicken basil and I have to tell you it was delicious ! Full of flavor and fresh, may be the best one I had so far  ! Definitely getting this again during my next visit and some sushi platter !"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Went for my daughter's 18th birthday - five of us.  Delicious food, wonderful people....this is our new home!"}
{"text":"Really impressed with the food at Royal Myanmar
 Every dish I've tried has had an amazing depth of flavor - not your run of the mill stir-fry here! I particularly liked the Spicy Basil Fried Rice. The sushi menu is varied as well. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great place to try new type of food, especially in Pittsburgh where diverse food selection seems to be quite limited. This was the first time I tried Burmese food and I've gotta say it was good and interesting. This restaurant seems quite popular, too. When we were there for dinner around 8pm, 6 of 9 tables in there were occupied.

We opted for tea leaf salad, ka poew chicken (essentially kang pao chicken..but we had no idea it was kang pao chicken..so we ordered)  and pickled mango curry. My husband also tried Burmese tea which was quite strong and not too sweet either (he couldn't go to sleep that night..that's how strong the tea was!). Overall, food portion was large and prices were reasonable. The food itself tasted good..though compared to Thai food that I'm used to..I'd say burmese curry tasted stronger but at the same time...food is generally blender than Thai ones, too.

Nice service though and I was glad I tried it. Burmese food is definitely rare to find..even in my current hometown Seattle...so I was personally happy to get to try something new during my trip in Pittsburgh this time around!"}
{"text":"Good food.   Like being invited to an Asian friend's home.    Sampler was great.   Spicy basil chicken was good, but the lemongrass beef missed the mark :(.   It would have been tastier if it came in smaller pieces.   The beef wasn't tender, and I could really taste the coconut in the coconut rice...it just tastes like white rice.   4 stars for unpretentious decor, good service, Thai sweet tea, and the sampler :)"}
{"text":"3.5 for this place only because my two girlfriends and I agreed we have had better sushi, it was a tiny bit heavy, and the ambience of the restaurant could use a little work.  Don't get me wrong the sushi was excellent and fresh, great price for the amount of food they give you and our service was attentive but not invasive.  I would definitely come back to this little hidden gem.  It is centrally located in West View not far off of McKnight and just about 15 minutes from my office..so that's convenient.

We weren't sure if this was a BYOB and I forgot to call, but when two of us arrived we saw a sign so we ran to the liquor store down the street and grabbed a bottle before our third person showed.

When we arrived, the young boy, I assume someones son, was sitting at a table and politely instructed us to seat ourselves. It was so cute!!I don't believe there was a corking fee and the inside of place was pretty simple.  Only one other table was taken when we got there, but by the time we left, most every table was occupied.  

Between the three of us, we had the West View Roll, Center Ave Roll, Shrimp Tempura, California Roll, California Roll and one other I cant remember the name.  We had two portions of edamame which was more than enough to share.  Each dish came with the side ginger salad which was crisp and fresh with a ginger dressing that had a lot of peanut flavor - which I liked.  Our bills were extremely reasonable with each roll being under $10 each (which is extremely rare from what I have found at other sushi restaurants).  They had really awesome large combination plates to share with anywhere from 15-60 pieces of sushi that were also really reasonably priced.

I would love to come back and try other things on the menu as well as more sushi options!  So glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in a little corner across from dunkin donuts. We were greeted immediately upon entering and sat very quickly. Service was excellent. They have a good sushi selection, not too overwhelming. We tried the dragon roll, royal Myanmar roll and sashimi platter. Everything was delicious. The prices are ridiculously good. Overall, excellent service, quiet atmosphere, very casual, great prices, very good food."}
{"text":"Great food! Been here 3 or 4 times now. Pad Thai is my favorite dish here so far. Also tried spicy basil fried rice amongst a few other things. Looking forward to exploring the menu more. Everything has really been great. Wish I lived closer so I could come more often!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Had the West View Roll along with the Royal Myanmar Tea and it was awesome. Perfect lunch and great service."}
{"text":"Had the royal   Myanmar appetizer, house salad, and sashimi combo. The appetizer was delicious, and the royal Myanmar tofu was super tasty. The salad with ginger dressing came free with checking in through yelp. the sashimi with combo was not that great since it had a weird taste to it; it seemed like it came out of the fridge with a mildew taste. 

I would like to come back for the tofu but the fish really disappointed me."}
{"text":"Being vegetarian we were skeptical initially but all others Indian restaurants were closed at that time (4 pm). When went there, we instantly liked the place and the very warm welcome. There were so many vegetarian choices. First she served salad with ginger sauce. We had amazing samosas with sauce, super duper fried rice with rightly fried tofu and rice is well done as well as tasty chewy, classic veg curry with coconut sauce which is out of the world, veggie noddles and what not. Superb food. Excellent service. Reasonably priced. I would rate it as a five any day!"}
{"text":"The Royal Myanmar is a wonderful surprise. I am new to Burmese cuisine, but I won't be for long. I ordered 3 vegetarian dishes, the spring rolls and the mango with sticky rice. Everything was delicious. The dining room is small but clean and comfortable. I liked the music, and loved the attentive service."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem right in the North! This totally unassuming restaurant tucked in West View has a great menu, including a variety of asian favorites. They have a pretty extensive sushi menu also that is priced so much more reasonably than most places. You can get a speciality roll with all the fixings for under $10... the same roll would run you $13-$16 at most places. And even though it is cheaper, it doesn't sacrifice on quality. We got a sushi platter for $29.99 that included 38 pieces of sushi, most of which were speciality rolls. It was delicious and filling and the perfect size for two people to share as a main meal."}
{"text":"Delicious food. From appetizers to salads  to dinners, the food  here is wonderful.   I'm not sure what characterizes Burmese food but the names of many dishes on the menu are familiar from Chinese,  Thai and Indian restaurants.  The chickpea tofu was wonderful  and I'd actually prefer it to soy tofu.   I also recommend samosas, pad Thai, spicy fried rice (nice big shrimp).  Service very accommodating, for example, modification to make a dish vegetarian.  Prices reasonable to a tad high.  BYOB.  Ambience is not this restaurant's best quality.  There is a lot more to explore on the menu.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious. More importantly, food is naturally made without artificial ingredients. 
For drink, do try Royal mayammar tea and mango milk shake."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's fresh, affordable and no frills.  The owner is the most flexible with substitutions and the sashimi platter is so good.  They take credit cards, are great for lunch and there are plenty of seats. Parking is plentiful and we love eating here.  Try the sashimi platter!"}
{"text":"It should be filled with people. My husband had The sushi,. It was fresh, good quality, and a very nice presentation. The Spring rolls are pretty fabulous.I had a tofu curry dish, it was just OK. It had a chicken broth base. Didn't taste much like cumin or curry. I would try them again, when I decide to eat meat."}
{"text":"We have been sad ever since the closing of Burma Tokyo in Oakland. Now that we've finally made it out here, it's pretty clear that this will be the replacement. It's totally a local hidden gem, and if you are just passing by it may just seem like another sushi bar. I can't say anything about their sushi, but the rest of the menu has plenty of Southeast Asian dishes to go around. Lots of different appetizers and salads, noodle soups and fried noodle, fried rice and meat/vegetable dishes. A good chunk is Thai-esque or close to Thai, while many others are more Burmese and can't be found elsewhere in Pittsburgh as far as I'm aware. The stir fried flat rice noodle (N3 on their menu) may remind you of a pad see ew, but it tastes quite difference and has lots of flavors in its own way (for one thing, more variety of ingredients). We also enjoyed the rice vermicelli and meatball soup (SP4, kway owe)--the noodles were very thin and fine, the meatballs (more like chunks) went well with the quail egg, and the richness of the broth was on the lighter side, which put the whole thing together. Overall, along with nice facilities and friendly service, this is definitely the place to go for Burmese food."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is truly a hidden gem in West View.  It is definitely not a fancy place inside, but they more than make up for it with their food.  If you eat in, they have the cutest little ceramic fish that you rest your chopsticks on.  I'm not quite sure why I love them so much, but I do!  Take out is also a great option, but make sure you give yourself a little extra time, as they can get very busy on the weekends.

I go mainly for their sushi, which is delicious!  Our typical order is spicy tuna roll, crunchy shrimp roll and blue crab roll.  Everything is always fresh and tasty.  They have many options from the simple roll to the more complex rolls.  The samosa appetizer is a fried dumpling like creation with a spicy, potato and onion mixture served with a sweet chili sauce on the side.  The prices are more than reasonable for the product you get.  Usually 3 rolls between my boyfriend and I and were are done! (And I promise we live to eat!)

The service is always polite and friendly.  It is obviously a local, family owned establishment which I always prefer over the big, chain brands.  If you haven't checked out Royal Myanmar yet, then definitely make plans to do so soon!"}
{"text":"Back again!
Had the Spicy Basil Chicken and the Spicy Salmon Roll.
And of course the Chicken Satay again ... With the awesome peanut sauce?!
For Dessert, Burmese Cake (Golden She Ji)
Get this à la Mode it is great with a little ice cream!
Every time I come here it makes me want to return to Myanmar to have good food and see my great friends there!"}
{"text":"I have stopped by here twice now for lunch, most recently with my father this a couple of Tuesday's ago.  We arrived at around 11:30 to find an empty restaurant.  As soon as we walked in our server hurried out from the back and gave us our choice of seats.  After taking our drink order she also turned on some calming music which I assume was Burmese.  The inside of Royal Myanmar isn't too much to look at.  The walls look like they can use a paint job but there are some paintings hanging on them.

For my lunch entree on this day I decided to go with the spicy basil chicken, spice level 9.  My dish consisted of stir fried chicken with basil, onion, bell pepper, scallion, cilantro with house special sauce and a side of rice.  Both my meat and my vegetables were cooked nicely in this dish.  What I really enjoyed the most about my dish was the sauce which had both some heat and some really complex flavors.  It made eating the dish incredibly enjoyable.  Service here was also really good as our server was constantly back to our table checking whether we need anything.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Everything that I have tried here has been good on both of my visits and the service has been good as well."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised! We didn't expect much out of a sushi place in west view but a 5 star review fits well. From the ginger salad, to the spicy basil chicken, everything was good... But the sushi, wow! The west view roll, Myanmar roll, shrimp tempura roll were all very good, better than ones I get downtown. The only way I know this place existed was by word of mouth, so I hope more people find out and keep a great restaurant in business."}
{"text":"Can we talk about the Drinking Noodle dish? I'm in love. So much umami. And I love these veggies in it but I don't know what they are. It also comes with shredded carrot. And the noodles...omg the noodles!  Thin and wide. Delicate yet Chewy. Perfect vessel for the yummy sauce. The sauce could be mostly butter for all I know. I have no idea how it's made but I just ate the whole portion by myself. 
If you haven't been to Royal Myanmar yet you're missing out."}
{"text":"Day after Christmas such a crazy holiday my husband and I had a chance to slip out and try this little place in Westview. Upon entering you think no way this food will be worth five stars. But the moment we met our hostess we knew we were in good hands. So do not be turned off by the lack of Decour and the very small size of the restaurant.
The menu has a nice Thai and Indian influence. From Currys to spice and slightly sweet drinks we enjoyed every bite. My husband ordered the spicy basil pork and I had the coconut chicken curry. We shared a Thai iced tea definitely order the Thai tea. 
I especially enjoyed talking with and having her her explain the influence the regions took upon the menu. Can't wait to go back and try other items."}
{"text":"OK the fried tofu is to die for!  We got a sampler appetizer platter the Royal Myanmar combination. They make their own tofu from scratch with chick peas. And they must work some kind of magic on them because I don't really like chick peas.  We also tried the broil Myanmar tea, and the Thai iced tea. Both were excellent. Spartan atmosphere but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and staff was super friendly. Went with a group of 4 and ordered appetizers and sushi. We got the spring roll, edema and crispy tofu for apps and the 38 Piece Royal Myanmar Platter that came with ginger dressing salad. So good, very happy we decided to try"}
{"text":"I've never ventured into the Westview before but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to check out Burmese cuisine! I went on a Friday night around 7 with my family. Upon entering, we were a little unsure based on the appearance. This place is small and lacks decor and proper lighting for the dinner crowd. We were told to pick our town table and as we headed to a spot in the corner, a waitress passed us carrying a sushi boat. The moment we saw that boat, we knew all the Yelp reviews were accurate! Wow- beautiful presentation and variety! 

We started with fresh spring rolls, squash fritters, blue crab roll and philly roll. They don't offer gluten free soy sauce but the sauces with the fritters and spring rolls are delicious. The rolls were fresh and exactly as described in the menu. The spring rolls were also freshly wrapped and not pre-made chilling in a fridge. I didn't try the fritters but my mom loved them, especially the sauce. We also ordered a Thai iced tea and an avocado milkshake. I thought my mother was going to choke on the milkshake she drank it so quickly. Her eyes were the size of dinner plates, she was so excited about how good it was. My Thai iced tea was refreshing! I used to make them when I worked at a Vietnamese restaurant & was very pleased with their version. 

Our entrees were spicy noodle with steamed tofu and veggies, singapore noodles with shrimp ,beef with lentils and miso soup. I was disappointed with the spice level of my spicy noodle dish, especially since I asked for an 8. I had to order a side of hot sauce. Fortunately, they gave me chili pepper paste and it was the perfect addition! The Singapore noodles were amazing. The best I've ever had. I couldn't believe how much flavor pulled through the noodles on their own. I tried the lentil sauce and it had in Indian flavor twist. A bit of spice so the side of rice smoothed out the punch. The miso soup needed salt but other than that- it was just how I like miso! Loaded with seaweed and tofu!

For dessert, we shared sticky rice with fresh sliced mango. Alone, the rice isn't that sweet but enter the mango to spruce up the dish! Fantastic combination! 

The prices are incredibly reasonable. Portion sizes are huge, everyone in my family had a to-go box. Service was very friendly and wait time wasn't too bad, considering how quickly the restaurant filled while we were there. I am pumped to go back and try more of their menu, especially a sushi boat!!"}
{"text":"I dont feel the food is anything different from Thai (same feeling as Nepal food to Indian food). The decoration was also disappointing."}
{"text":"Very good food, enjoyed the chicken curry and appetizer sampler.  Certainly different, but very good.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! We drove 30 mins to eat here and it was worth it. Fried tofu (made with chickpeas) were delicious and so were our entrees. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We went here tonight for the first time.  We loved it and will be back soon!  We did takeout but would like to try and dine-in next time.  I hope others hear about this place and patronize it so we can keep this gem in west view."}
{"text":"Don't let the Spartan decor fool you, the food here is seriously good.  My wife and I split an appetizer of chicken satay skewers.  We got 3 large skewers, expertly cooked, tender, juicy and delicious. The peanut cucumber side sauce was a nice compliment.

For dinner we had the Royal Myanmar noodle soup and Pork Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw.  The soup was delicious in a flavorful but mildly spiced chicken broth.  The pork Nyat was spiced to taste (I went with 5 on a scale of ten) and was hearty and delicious.

It's BYOB so if you want alcohol, bring it.

Dinner for 2 was $26 before tip, which given quality of the food was a screaming bargain.  Worth a trip."}
{"text":"Delicious unique food. Rather sparse and plain atmosphere. Yes a hole in the wall. BYOB. Bar around the corner that does take out six packs and liquor store a half mile away. Had dishes I've never had before.  

Seems out of place in West View. They should move it to Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"Holy crap - what? Is the most fun sushi in Pittsburgh being served in a little hole in the wall in West View? it kind of seems like it is .... the way DiPietro's belongs as the undeniable anchor of the Centre-Perry, frankly, Royal Myanmar belongs there on merit alone. Their sushi offerings are HUGE, and it's clear the ingredients are fresh and of high quality. Where this joint really shines is in the specialty rolls. At like 8-10 bucks, these things are seriously like 30-50% bigger than your average GOOD roll from your typical joints around town. Not to take anything from them - I do love, like, Umi, and Andy's in Wholey's - but for like $9 to get a specialty roll unlike anything else I've ever had (there are plenty of fun, creative ingredients and combinations they've come up with here) is good enough to make a guy like me happy. The fact that it is enough maki to fill like a full-sized dinner plate really just makes it a home run.  

And that's before talking about the Burmese food. I only had one dish, some savory pork thing. It was awesome. This was a delivery order - I just left a note saying something to the effect of \"please make this as spicy as possible.\" Normally, I leave a note like that and expect, really, literally nothing in response. Even when I leave a note like that, if they ignore my note but the food is good, I'm a happy camper. But the awesome ladies at Royal Myanmar actually just went ahead and killed it on this. The woman who met met at the counter explained that they saw my request for extra spiciness and stood about for a moment thinking about how to make the dish spicy where they did not normally offer it as spicy (I failed to think of this). She assured me they'd come up with a great plan -- included in the mix were some hot green chiles that they'd decided would add heat to the dish without screwing up the flavor balance. This was contrary to the red fried chiles we're all used to seeing in spicy-designed dishes and/or the red chili paste that restaurants (and I) just slather on to make dishes spicy. That was just like incredibly thoughtful and cool. And you know what? My pork dish was awesome; it had some added spice from the green chiles, but even if it hadn't had that, it would still have been great because the quality of the meat was really good and the vegetables were perfectly cooked.

That's the level of attention to their work they have at this place... The sushi is insane, the stir fried cuisine is just perfect.... frankly, I can't wait to eat at Royal Myanmar again. I want to eat the rest of this place's menu. It's just awesome. I hope West View steps up and proves it deserves it."}
{"text":"This little restaurant has been on my must do list for a while now and after 1 visit, I'm looking forward to more! Burmese cuisine was different than what I pictured in advance and I have to say our minor sampling intrigued me to know and explore their menu more. The prices here are so reasonable that you can sample many dishes very reasonably. 

There are several amazing sounding soups and salads. The ginger salads were included with our meals & they were possibly the most flavorful I've ever had. Good start. We shared the seafood sushi sampler - very basic but at $6.99 for 16 pieces, you can't go wrong. I order the pickled mango pork and my husband got the chicken curry with cumin. We intentionally picked more traditional Burmese dishes and we're really glad we did. Both were dishes of roasted meats packed with incredible flavor with a side of rice. Sort of felt like delicious comfort food. Very unexpected in a very good way. 

Service was exceptional and the space is very basic and casual. The food is clearly the star and its apparent they do a brisk take-out business here, too."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! They are very friendly and provide excellent customer service. The food is really delicious. I've tried their spicy Thai basil fried rice, mango sticky rice, tempers roll, crunchy roll, tofu salad and fried tofu! All exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"Burmese food in West View. Crazy! I've been ordering 2-3 different dishes a week since it opened. The chicken dishes are really solid. Lots of great non-Americanized dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Small family restaurant but big in portion. My gf and I couldn't finish the 2 entries that we order. Avocado milk shake was delicious and again, have to take the extra in a to-go cup. We will b back again to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"The BEST sushi! I have had several different sushi rolls from here many times and have not had a bad experience yet. It's so fresh, delicious and well priced. I prefer this sushi over anything I've tried at upscale restaurants downtown! This is my go - to take out!"}
{"text":"Wow! Yay for yelp, bc I certainly would've never found this on my own. Very impressed. Sushi was outstanding. Pad Thai was very good. Spicy chicken curry was like nothing I've ever had, which is always exciting to me (if it's good, haha). Reasonable prices. Really looking forward to going back sometime, even though I don't live very close."}

{"text":"Do not let the decor fool you. This place is awesome. We've tried a little of everything the few times we've been in- sushi, salads, noodle dishes, soups- everything has been delicious. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly people and reasonable prices. I have never been disappointed with any of my many meals there! The portions are great, too. If you want good sushi, come here!! I do feel bad that there's barely anyone who eats in, but I think they're doing well for themselves!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Asian food in Pittsburgh, look no further. Real crab meat in their sushi!! 

I have tried different things on their menu and each time blown away! Rice dish was authentic not Americanize. Sushi was fresh. Also called to make a last minute order for a sushi platter for an office party.  It was beautifully presented and was a popular item ;) gone in minutes.

Keep up the awesome job Royal Myanmar ;)"}
{"text":"Best sushi for the price!  Friendly staff.  Walls could use a fresh coat of paint but the overall dining experience was pleasant and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Started off with the Kim Chi Kyee Gae soup which is a Kim Chi spicy soup that was really good and spicy. Then a fresh salad with ginger dressing. We ordered Lemmongrass beef with coconut rice and Kauk Swe Kyaw. The beef was fall apart tender and delicious in a lemon broth. The Kauk Swe Kyaw is a noodle dish with vegetables and egg.with your choice of meat. It is a spicy dish. 

The person that waited on us was very helpful and patient with our questions. Great place and fair prices and I will be back."}
{"text":"Yessss! I am a fan. Royal Myanmar has been under my bookmark since two years ago, and I finally decided to come try it with one of my girlfriends. It's actually a far drive from me, but I'd said it's worth it. Especially theres very few Burmese places in Pittsburgh.. I was very satisfied after my visit. My initial thought was wow this place is small but very homey. There weren't many servers but the customer services we got was great, always make sure we have enough water and didn't rush us out after we paid. 
For their food, I ordered a noodle dish with chicken, I don't remember the name but it was so delicious. I asked for a spicy level 6/10.. which was definitely spicier than I expected but I love it. That is how you know a Thai or Burmese place is authentic. Lol
I highly recommended this place, and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Finally... I've been wanting to check this place out for months! With all the rave reviews, and also the lack of Burmese food in Pittsburgh, I was super excited to check it out. A little venture to West View never hurt nobody, right? 

The place is not fancy, but it's not necessary when you have delicious food and friendly service! We were the only ones in on a Tuesday night, but hopefully that will change as more people hear how great it is!

We pretty much stuffed ourselves with everything that was recommended as authentic Burmese. We started with the Royal Myanmar combination sampler, which was somosas, chicken satay and crispy tofu. Plus we ordered the squash fritter. Everything in the platter was okay, but that chili sauce really added to it all. The fritters were a little bland unfortunately (the sauce fixed that right up!). 

The main dishes were really the fab! We ordered the Coconut Chicken Curry, Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw and Lemongrass Beef. The beef we were told, is slow cooked all day, so it was seriously just falling to pieces as you picked it up. The chicken was the same in terms of cooked to perfection. And both sauces were incredible. 

The beef came with coconut rice... which I'd opt for instead of regular rice any day! The coconut rice specifically only comes with a handful of dishes and isn't listed as a side. I'd definitely see if you can order it instead of the regular rice if you can though! 

The Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw was good, but I could have done with a little more flavor. I love noodle though, so I'm interested to come back and check out the other noodle dishes. We thought about ordering sushi, but didn't. I'd also be interested to see how that is. Basically what I\"m saying is, I\"ll absolutely be back. All that food we ordered came to around $60 and it was a feast! Can't wait for the next feast..."}
{"text":"I did some take out and was very happy with my order. So glad to have found this new spot ! I had a few sushi rolls and they were delicious and well priced. I'll be returning for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here six or seven times, and we are \"old friends\" to the owner, who is extremely friendly. She will happily explain each dish and how it is prepared. My wife tends to get P3 (we don't remember the name), which is delicious every time. I always get the sushi, which is just as good as the other reviews say it is. I like the simple Philly roll with smoked salmon, but have also tried the West View roll and several others. The complimentary salad is VERY good, with exceptional ginger dressing. 

There is usually quiet Burmese background music, which sets a nice mood for dinner. 

Like many family-owned Asian restaurants, the family's children are often in attendance. They are invariably quiet and well-behaved, and we really enjoy their presence. One boy is often present doing his school work (education is very important in Myanmar/Burma)."}
{"text":"Having been to Royal Myanmar twice now, I am very conflicted in my review.   Both times the portion times were generous.  The price points are reasonable and the staff is warm and inviting.  Finding Burmese cuisine in the North Hills of Pgh is also very exciting!  I will be back to try them again. Probably for dinner. 

The first time that I dined the food was amazing. I went to dinner with friends. Spice levels were on point. I was amazed. I shared entrees with my table so I was able to try several dishes. Which were all amazing. My favorites were the Pad Thai which was served with noodles with crunchy fresh peanuts, carrots, and sprouts in a chili paste.  So good. We had it served with chicken. 

Our meal began with sushi and samosa. Honestly, I didn't real dig into the sushi.  My friend was in the mood for it. I just wasn't in a sushi kind of mood and went for the samosa. It was delicious. Filled with warm, perfectly chopped potato, peas, and veggies. Wrapped in a tasty, crispy shell. Spiced perfectly. Each bite better than the previous. 

The mango sticky rice also stood out for being A-MAZ-ING.  I was hesitant to order it but my friend insisted. So glad she knew what she was doing. It's now a favorite item. We also ordered the Spicy Basil Fried Rice, Coconut Curry Chicken.  I loved the it. It was served with big plump clean tasting - as in it tasted like higher quality- pieces of shrimp. The seasoning was perfection and the Rice was filled with fresh basil, green beans, carrot, and just - perfect. 

The coconut curry & spicy basic chicken were also delicious from the small bites I had. I wish I had given them more attention but I was too full to really get to know them well. I hope to return another day to become better acquainted. 

I left dinner happy, full, highly impressed, and looking forward to my next return. The owners were a delight. I loved the family dynamic of the management and ownership of the restaurant. 



Looking forward to another exceptional meal, I invited my deal friend to lunch at Royal Myanmar. We each ordered our own lunch. (Mainly since she is a red meat eater and I'm not.) 

We started with the Dragon Roll. Which was HUGE and a delight.  Since it was lunch, we didn't even finish it before lunch arrived. We each ordered an entree. I ordered the Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw.  It was not what I expected having previously had their Pad Thai. The Pad Thai is really good. The Nyat Khaukswe Kyaw was singular in spice when hitting my tongue, lacked heat, and not what I expected. Which was extremely disappointing for THIS dish and THIS restaurant. It seemed to lack spice in comparison to my last visit. I'm hoping it was just an off day and that the next time I visit the spicing and notes of flavor are back up to par. Since I've really only had that item once before at a different establishment, I'm not an expert in this ethnic delicacy but it's my understand that it typically has a kick to it that was missing. Despite this dish not being a favorite, I plan to return again soon. This is a restaurant that is worth taking a trip to West View to visit."}
