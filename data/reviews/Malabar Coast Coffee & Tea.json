{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday. I got my usual soy milk latte and it was perfect. Love the feel of this place. I could definitely see myself hanging out here on a regular basis. Coffee, atmosphere, staff A+. I live in Chicago so I was surprised to see such a large hometown shop here but I'm so happy I found it!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop has changed a few times over a handful of years. I am not sure what the problem is? Since it had become Malabar Coast Coffee & Tea I have stopped in about 10 times. Stoughton desperately needs a good coffee shop with better (later) hours. I work till 5 in Madison, and if I ever want to stop at a coffee shop after work to read or even just to grab a coffee I know I need to do it in Madison as this location closes by 6pm most day (or earlier).  The coffee has always been great, I typically order the turtle latte. I like a coffee that is hot but not so hot that I can not drink it right away. They also have a decent selection of loose leaf teas to choose from if coffee is not your style.   There is a small food menu, I have tried both a breakfast sandwich as well as a sandwich for lunch. Both were good but do know it can take some time for the food to be prepared.   The atmosphere is cozy with a good mix of table/chairs and lounge chairs and couches. I would say this coffee shop isn't exactly kid friendly as other coffee shops I have been to.   Perhaps it is a staffing issue but I feel like I either come at the busiest times or they are just under staffed.   This place gets a solid 3 stars from me. If their hours change, I could see it getting more stars from me."}
{"text":"First off - located at Anytime Fitness so they are hard to find but worth it. Lovely breakfast sandwich and good coffee. Scones are very good - soft and delicate instead of being chunks of granite. Outdoor seating when weather permits. A great find!"}
{"text":"Took over for True Coffee Roasters at some point in 2015 and they are doing a much better job with our favorite local coffee shop. They have made some small updates to the seating and set up, which is nice. Good food, friendly-ish service, and they've added a loyalty card. I'm a tea drinker so I'm not sure if the coffee's good, but the tea is fresh and that says a lot in my book."}
{"text":"I WANT to really like this place. It's adorable. The drinks are good. The atmosphere is comfy and cozy.. It has all the key elements to make it a good coffee shop.   The first time I was in, one of the very first things I noticed was if you're waiting to place an order, and the barista is busy making something, there will be absolutely no acknowledgement of your presence.   Not a \"hi,\" \"hello,\" or \"it'll be just a moment.\" Absolutely nothing. The first time I thought, okay, maybe it was a fluke.. but I was back this morning and the exact same thing happened again. So both visits now have started with long awkward waits for rushed order placing.   Both of these instances were at roughly 7:30am when there appeared to be just one person working (and it was fairly busy, too!). Around 8am or so, another employee arrived. It seemed to me that in both instances the coffee shop was under-staffed to handle the amount of customers. I get it that the barista's were working, and trying to get things done as quickly as possible, but if it's a struggle, as it appears to be, management should do something about it."}
