{"text":"I went here with my husband and our whole experience was wonderful!  This place just seems like it was the owner's dream to open a restaurant and that's what they did.  It seems super authentic from the atmosphere right down to the food.  I've never been to Mexico but I was instantly brought back to seaside restaurants in Brazil.  The service was great and our server was super friendly.
I ordered the fried red snapper with garlic and it was absolutely amazing!  The plate looked beautiful and the flavor was so good.  It came with french fries (this is a common thing at a Brazilian seaside place so I just assume it is in Mexico as well), rice, garlic bread (yummy) and a salad (the salad looked nice but was mainly iceberg, which I don't care for, however, I'll point back to the fact that I think this is traditional).  My husband wasn't that hungry so he got tacos el pastor, which he said were good.

I've seen some complaints that I wanted to give my 2 cents on.  This is a Mexican seafood restaurant which means it isn't going to be like stereotypical Mexican place that many people are used to.  If you go in expecting it to be like the more common U.S. Mexican places you WILL be disappointed.  While the menu isn't exclusively seafood, seafood is really what this place is about and that's what they do best.  Don't give this place a bad rating because you didn't realize it's a fish restaurant.  Also, I've seen people complain about prices as well which I really don't understand.  Seafood is usually pricey.  That's just how it is.  When you go here you should expect to pay seafood restaurant prices, they need to charge enough to stay in business!  I'm not saying you should eat here if you're not into the food, but it isn't really fair to judge this place because you were under a misconception about what it is or should be.

Las Islas Del Mar transports you right to the Mexican seaside and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Found this place in Yelp and tried it out with 4 other friends. Definitely the best Mexican seafood in the down! Will definitely visit again when the weather get warmer."}
{"text":"Good chow, reasonably priced.  Fish tacos delish with lightly fried fish chunks.  Rad snapper Diablo also fried but not greasy and not that spicy. Salsa and some other dip were great with crispy tortillas."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place one star if I could go lower. No one in my three person party enjoyed their food. I was just in the mood for a nice saucy enchilada. What I received was the driest Mexican travesty I've ever seen. It was inedible. I really wanted to like this place, as having a great Mexican restaurant so close would be a dream come true, but unfortunately, for now, I'll have to keep on dreaming."}
{"text":"I'd give the food a 5 and the service a 2.5-3. Went for Father's Day dinner tonight. The fish ceviche and green sauce appetizer they bring to all tables is wonderful! Only wish it hadn't taken 15 min for our drink order to be taken because it has some kick. We also had the guacamole which was fresh and super reasonable. So delicious. Great selection of bottled Mexican beers too. We had fish tacos, prawns, grilled mussels, shrimp empanadas, pork tacos, crab tostada, steak tacos and fried shrimp between the five of us. It was all wonderful. 

I will definitely be back and hopefully the service is faster so I can change my rating to a five. It is super authentic Mexican seafood so don't expect anything texmex. The majority of the clientele were Hispanic as well which can vouch for the authenticity in my opinion too.

Glad we took the chance to come and try something different."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to this new business. The outside is painted a bright light blue and is very inviting. The inside is very clean and new and has nice tables and comfy chairs. Staff was friendly and professional.

 Now- on to the food. I opened the menu and was presented with voluminous of all but impossible to read and understand items. The entire thing is in spanish with english subtitles printed in a white/black reverse over all these photos of the food--it might get clearer after a margarita or two. It was so confusing and hard to understand.

 Like many new restaurants they are obviously experiencing growing pains with trial & error. There are no traditional combination platters available but rather all the different food categories are listed out separate. 

 I ordered a tacos, the chicken was pretty good, grilled and nicely pulled, but the carne asada was inedible, it was almost 100% comprised of gristle and sinew, and sadly, had zero seasoning. The \"spanish rice\" is not spanish and is just white rice with frozen mixed veg (carrot, corn, peas, beans) added to it--very strange and unappetizing.  Even the salsa verde was lacking, this is just ground up pickled jalape√±os and does NOT compliment the food one bit.

I HATE giving such bad reviews on a new business, I want them to succeed, we need a great mexican restaurant in Monona, but unless they make some sweeping changes and soon, their days are clearly numbered, sorry to say."}
{"text":"Awesome food, ambiance, and it's authentic. I'm always happy with service because I know they have only a few people hired. Been back many times."}
{"text":"Wow! First time at Las Islas and it won't be my last. This place was hopping! A number of families were enjoying their dinners with gusto. Very pleasantly surprised the server presented us with fried corn tortillas, salsa verde (yum) and ceviche. I could have gobbled up the ceviche in a moment but I restrained myself so that my husband and friends could get a bite.  The basket of tortillas also had a ton of saltines for the ceviche but I preferred the crispy tortillas. I got a coctel de camarrones y pulpo - shrimp/octopus cocktail. It wasn't as flavorful as I've had expected but the octopus was tender and, hey, we're a long way from the coast. My husband got the fried tilapia with garlic.  It comes as a whole fish which I like (I don't look it in the eye!) but I'm bet the cook would remove the head if you asked. It was super crispy and wonderful. The garlic was not overpowering but made a great sop-up-the-sauce for the piece of garlic bread. MMM. We were both sucking on the fish bones!! My mouth is watering just thinking of it. A friend got the molcaheta nayarita (new to me) served bubbling in a stone bowl: it was made up of shrimp, octopus, scallops and fish in a wonderful, complex-flavored sauce. Although it seemed pricy at $29, the portion was huge and he was able to take 1/2 of it home for another meal.  Wow, I'm going to get that next time! They have a juke box that plays LOUD and although it provided a for a festive Mexican atmosphere. It was a little hard to hear each other. Once the tunes were over they had a soccer game on the 2 big screen TVs and they were not blaring. The only other thing that was a little annoying was that the tables for 4 are just a little too small to comfortably seat 4 people side-by-side. Minor detail. Compliments to the chef and the very friendly, knowledgable staff who made this a great meal."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with all the options.  I ordered the octopus platter and it was really good.  I am very picky and they accommodated to my substitutions. My husband had the fish tacos.  They were okay, a little oily.  The ceviche was very good.  We will definitely go back, as it was very reasonable and the food was good quality."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh authentic Mexican seafood. We will definitely be back soon. Loved the ceviche and fresh salsa!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had a delicious soup with seafood. The service was great. I give the restaurant and service 5 stars. The best Mexican food in Madison."}
{"text":"omg...go here- all about the garlic shrimp. This place reminds me of those great seafood restaurants in Baja Sur. My husband got the fried fish tacos which were also really yummy."}
{"text":"Don't go!  Don't go!  I was there last night and was charged $20 for 2 pina coladas that I swear were virgin lada nothing.  I could of had my own bottle of rum for $20.  Sorry guys, you are not a place that makes drinks worth that much.  I would pay it when it is worth it, but this was a regular sized pina colada glass and all coconut milk which I believe is $1.20/can at a store and they probably get it in balk; I am just saying.  My table ordered the big $58 feast that we saw was on sale, but we were charged full price.  I believe that was a difference of $10 or just about that.  I guess looking at us, we must have screamed \"has $ to throw away\", I work for my dollars and for hard working people, it is not fair to be ripped off.  Look out your windows, there was no cars in your parking lot on a Friday night.  We should have seen the sign, but instead we tried your mafia front restaurant and \"NO\" we did not like your mystery sauce that was not listed on the menu.  I believe we were supposed to get grilled seafood, not boiled in old tomatoes to hide the old fish smell prawns and such.  Its Christmas, do you think everyone has money to just hand over to you guys?  The service was great; until our waitress left before we were done eating.  

The worst was my vegetarian friend, for her bean burrito turned into everything they had to get rid of in a can.  Good thing she was given a dull steak knife to cut her canned vegetable- \"where are the beans\" burrito."}
{"text":"Very bland. I've definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"Yes, this looks like a Burger King on Monona Drive painted blue...but don't be deterred.  Las Islas serves up very generous portions of delicious seafood, Mexican style, as well as the expected tacos, etc. You start with complementary cerviche and home-made tortillas.   I recently had Sopa de 7 Mares (soup of the seven seas) and it was delightful, as were the piping hot shrimp and cheese empanadas. My big bowl had crab legs, oysters, octopus, fish, prawns, and shrimp in a delicious soup.   Portion big enough to take half home for dinner.  I have also tried the \"cocktails\" with shrimp, octopus, fish, whatever you want - cool and delicious large portions.  My only complaint is the TV on loud for the fans of Mexican soaps and soccer, but oh well, the other patrons enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Came here to eat after driving passed it many times and I got to say I was pretty impressed. The food was great and the drinks where very good as well. I had their fish ceviche which was great. Recommend the place if you are looking for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Its a 4 star for the food but had to take off a point for service.

The menu was a bit difficult to navigate as most of it was in Spanish.  OK, I can deal with that but this IS the US and MOST of us DO speak English so maybe the next time (if it happens) they can update the menu a bit.  At least write the same stuff in the same font size.

Anyway, beer selection was great and the waitress brought out the appetizer right away and it was very good.  We didn't have a huge appetite so ordered some burritos and sat back and enjoyed the beer and chips.  And sat back, and back, ordered another beer and waited.  Other tables who came after us were getting served.  We sat back and had more of our beer and waited.  Come on!!! How long does it take to make a burrito??  Apparently 50 minutes!  All the time we saw the wait staff and kitchen staff standing around and yakking.  

When we finally got our food, it was VERY good.  But it was not a VERY GOOD experience."}
{"text":"What a gem! Just driving by in search of dinner I almost missed it. There was a lovely complimentary ceviche to start and super friendly service - off to a great start. Empanadas with shrimp and cheese were delicious  (4 for a small order) and were followed by garlic shrimp platter with generous amount of garlicky shrimp, French fries, salad and rice. Filling and more food than I expected. Leftovers for tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place.  From the palm tree in the parking lot to the bright, clean, cheerful interior and very friendly wait staff, there is much to make one smile.  The complimentary appetizer of tostadas and ceviche is a very nice touch, but the ceviche is devoid of seafood flavor and, but for the fresh red onion and cilantro, would be flavorless.  I ordered fish tacos,which should be a standby.  They were unlike any I have seen:  small breaded cubes of tasteless fish, fried to a greasy and limp consistency.  My friend had shrimp,tacos, which were somewhat better but could have been crispier.  The corn tortillas were soggy and oily.  It was as if the oil in the fryer was not at a sufficiently high temp, which may have been the case because we ate on the early side.  We also ordered a ceviche cocktail.  It had lots of shrimp and octopus but the seafood was overwhelmed by the V-8 flavored liquid in which it was served.  I am accustomed to ceviche that is \"cooked\" in a citrus-based acidic liquid, not tomato juice.  I will give this place another try because I really want to love it."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once. I probably should try again but won't.

I thought the food was under seasoned and over-priced. I understand that seafood is expensive but I want to be able to taste it. I could just as well have been eating chicken. 

I see other reviews that are way more positive. I think my negativity also stems from the fact that service was terrible and there was only me and another table of two."}
{"text":"Las Islas Del Mar - the Islands of the Sea. I'm not sure why you would be surprised if your land based dishes were simply okay when you're going to a seafood place.

That said, I've been here a couple times now and it's been great. Service was friendly, though not the best with English. Food was great, though it is a little bit of a wait for food. They keep you occupied with fresh fried tortillas and cerviche as an appetizer.  The food.. that was consistently delicious. First time I got the fish tacos which were flavorful and had great texture. Not much to elaborate on, as they were textbook good fish tacos.

The second time I split the Molcajeta Nayarita, which was exceptional. It was a seafood bowl filled with prawns, shrimp crab, mussels, clams, a delicious sauce and awesome. You will make a mess, and you will leave satisfied.

Definitely worth coming back again."}
{"text":"The Langostinos were amazing. Just the right amount of heat and the spices were incredible. We will definitely be back when we drive through again!!!"}
{"text":"We came In for lunch and decided to order dinner entres. They just looked so good...Seafood was cooked just right and flavors are great. Prices are reasonable for seafood and the food came out quick. The courtesy chips and salsa were awesome. service were good and friendly. Will be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"How did I not know about Las Islas Del Mar? This place is great! We went on Friday night. The building is not too impressive from the outside and there were not many folks there when we arrived. There is plastic outdoor furniture if you want to eat outside. Inside it looked like a fairly typical festive Mexican restaurant albeit w/a seafood theme. The waiter showed us to a table. There were four chairs crammed around it but we pushed a couple of chairs aside and made room. We ordered margaritas which were delicious. As we were eating more and more people arrived.

Our waiter was friendly, courteous, and prompt. He checked up on us multiple times and made certain we were enjoying our meal.

The menu is primarily seafood based and is in both English and Spanish. While we were perusing the menu our waiter brought us a platter with flat fried tortilla shells, soda crackers, lime wedges, a green salsa, and ceviche. We'd never seen anything like that and it was amazing. The ceviche was delicious. I could be happy with a meal of just that ceviche. The salsa was fresh, bright, and really spicy. A little goes a long ways. We were off to a great beginning.

For appetizers we ordered the oysters topped with shrimp and octopus. The raw oysters came covered w/chopped up langoustines, onion, pepper, cilantro, and tons of octopus which had the texture of dry mushrooms but amazing flavor. The appetizer was huge and we were getting full. The meal just kept getting better.

I ordered the langostinos a la plancha and my partner got the octopus with garlic. My prawn platter came w/a mass of fries, a lettuce salad, a ball of rice, and a dozen prawns in a garlicky, buttery, spicy blend. The prawn were shell on, including head, so they were very messy to eat. But the flavor? Wow! I was licking my fingers clean. The fries could definitely have been crispier, too much starchy potato texture for my taste, but I dipped them in the sauce from my prawns and the leftover green salsa and they went down quite smoothly.

We left completely stuffed, yet wanting to try so many additional items. I can't wait to go back. This is one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times now. Ceviche served as appetizer is always fresh and other dishes I've had make me feel like I'm eating back home. Drinks are also really good, I recommend trying Cantaritos, a tequila and grapefruit soda drink."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend tonight. You can't beat getting ceviche and salsa as a free app instead of your typical salsa and chips. We both had the shrimp and octopus cocktail, but I had the spicy version. The spicy one came with nicely cooked, shell-on shrimp (three) - with the heads on - loved it! The medium is PLENTY for one person (but I could try to tackle the large if I was really hungry and didn't go to town on the app). There are so many other delicious-looking seafood dishes, too, that I have never seen anywhere else in Madison. A hidden gem! There was plenty of seating, too. We got there at 5:30 on a Wednesday, and there weren't very many customers. Honestly, I can't imagine why, since the service was speedy and friendly, and the food was plentiful and flavorful."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim on a Friday night knowing only that they had pretty good reviews and this was a Mexican and seafood joint. We weren't sure what to expect based on the looks of the place but we are happy we came! It was nice to have ceviche and hot green chile sauce for complimentary apps in place of the usual chips and salsa.. we ordered 6 tacos to split between the two of us- just $2 for meat and $2.50 for seafood tacos. What a steal. They don't have traditional salsa on the menu but they do offer pico de gallo, so that was a must, and it was SO fresh and tasty. The atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired, but it really was an awesome value and friendly service too."}
{"text":"One of my first reviews of a WI based venue in almost a year! Mexican fare of all things! (like I dont have that all over in SD right?)

Anywho, my folks and I always try and pick a new unique place none of us have been to before I head back to Cali after vacations home so after some talk, Mexican was the cuisine, what kind or what theme was unknown. Yelp's help got us to find this place. Open for 3 years almost we liked what we saw and I liked the idea of a seafood-centric Mexican place over what I normally find in SD (tacos, burritos, chilaquiles, tortas etc....)

Overall this place was awesome. I really did end up liking how much seafood selection the place had to offer. It did offer non-seafood dishes and options, yes but by and far most is food from the sea prepared in Mexican fashion with all the traditional staples accounted for,

Between our 3 entrees, the large sized molcajete stone bowl, 7 mares bowl of soup we have more than enough for 3 people let me say! 5 easy even with my bottomless pit!

I would order everything we had again for sure. My fajitas were a little bit on the oily side I must say. I like mine more on the dry grill/char side vs soaked in oils. Still good but not ideal.

The server/co-owner was very nice and kind. We spoke to her quite a bit about the restaurant, the food, their start, what items they pride themselves on etc. Pretty neat to get the inside scoop from her.

Our bill was right about $90 but again, 3 entree's and 3 large shareable items were ordered and we had 3 boxes of take home AFTER we ate what we could. So this made for almost 6 meals of seafood based Mexican food that we enjoyed. Plus this was a splurge of sorts as its the last good meal I had with the parents before scooting back out to SD. 

If you're in Madison and crave Mexican but want something clearly off the beaten path and like seafood, this is your place for sure."}
{"text":"Change your hours if you're not going to be open until the posted time.  We went out of our way to come here."}
{"text":"My wife and I try a new restaurant almost monthly.  This was our first outdoor meal this year and a very pleasant surprise.  We ate under a palapa (grass umbrella) next to realistic looking palm trees.  Not your stereotypical Mexican restaurant, this place is really about seafood.  I have always loved the fresh seafood when we are in Mexico and these people do a great job.  The staff was prompt and courteous, bringing complimentary whole fried corn tortillas (tostada), green chile salsa, and ceviche that was refreshingly different and quite good.  The menu is extensive and varies widely in price (fish tacos to a platter of raw oysters, scallops, shrimp, abalone, crab legs etc).  The waitress was very helpful and told us which items were also designed to serve a party of 4 or more people (fun idea for future outing with friends).  The menu is Spanish with English subtitle ingredient summaries and there are pictures of most dishes on the menus and also above the windows.  At least I could read it without my glasses, I guess if you want a completely English menu, stick to Taco Bell.  The portions were more than we could eat.  I had Pulpo Diablo (Octopus in devil sauce) that had a some tang but not hot for the sake of hot.  Seafood is often overpowered and this was complimentary and delicious.  The presentation was nice with a lettuce, cucumber tomato salad , an orange slice and really good bread (see photo).  I found french fries a bit out of place, but I didn't have room to eat them anyway.  All in all a great experience and I can't wait to return and try other menu items.  I hope we can keep this unique seafood restaurant in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Literally no complaints here. Fun exterior, good prices, huge menu, good food and good service.

You get fried tortillas, salsa and civiche for a free app when you arrive. The civiche is a bit different than any kind I've had before and it was good, pure fish and lime. I had the garlic shrimp (camarones al ajo), which were cooked just right, piping hot and drenched in garlic, just my style. If you only sort of like garlic this is not a plate for you. Also, wasn't a fan of the frozen oven baked French fries. Plate was 13.99.

My hubby got the fried fish tacos. Tricky though as the fish isn't fried the whole taco is, with the fish inside. Unique take and pretty tasty. A bit on the oily side though, for obvious reasons. Plate was 8.50.

We would go back for sure. Unique Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"We've driven by this restaurant so many times.  I'm just sad it took us this long to stop in. 

Casual atmosphere with great service. Ceviche, salads and limes are served with tostadas instead of your regular chips and salsa.  The ceviche is different then I've had before but oh so good.  

I had the fried shrimp tacos.  3 tacos, a side salad and their ranchero sauce come with the order.   The food is fresh and made to order.  He tacos were filling and super delicious.  

My mate had the garlic shrimp.   Come hungry and don't expect them to skip on the order.   His order came with fries, rice, a side salad and some bread.   Again very fresh and very filling.  

We will defiantly come back soon and can't wait to try their specialty drinks."}
{"text":"Really happy to have stopped to try out Las Islas Del Mar! We were lured in by the appeal of outdoor seating under umbrellas. There was a bit of a wait for a table as only a couple waitresses served the entire restaurant, but service was prompt afterwards. But let's get down to brass tacks: 1) the meal comes with free ceviche and delicious, spicy salsa; 2) the tacos al pastor are on point. The fish tacos weren't quite as tasty (fried fish, kinda tasteless), but the shrimp tacos were alright and the accompanying sauce hit the spot. The sauce reminds me of a great condiment they serve everywhere in France (called \"samurai sauce\" for no logical or apparent reason) and seems to be a mixture of mayo and harissa. I'm a fan. Excited to come back to try some of the more adventurous crab dishes and the gigantesque cocktails. All in good time!"}
{"text":"I've lived within walking distance of this place for over a year and I refused to go in because I didn't like the exterior color of the building (it's a truly horrible teal blue pastel).

Turns out, I didn't know what I was missing. Last week, my husband and I decided to give it a try. We went back again today.

Last week, we ordered some asada tacos (pretty good, though not as good as La Rosita's asada tacos, which is down the street). We also ordered chicken fajitas. They were decent as well. Turns out, we should have ordered the seafood.

One thing we did notice was the the service was slow. Not because they were super busy or overwhelmed or anything. It's just slow. And as long as you go in there expecting to enjoy a leisurely meal where time means nothing, this place will exceed your expectations.

Today my husband and I took a friend to dinner at Las Islas Del Mar for our second visit. I ordered the deep fried shrimp tacos. They were fantastic. My husband ordered some soft tacos (shrimp and fish), and he says they were excellent.

Neither of us could handle the spicy sauces. Too spicy. That is because we are wimps.

Our friend ordered a noodle dish that seemed heavily infused with various types of shellfish. He said it was really good. Our friend also enjoyed the spicy sauces. That is because our friend is not a wimp.

The beer selection is certainly not suitable for hipsters or local brew aficionados, but if you're looking for a summery Mexican beer selection, you'll have a fine time ordering beer.

The side dishes (rice, beans & salad) are your standard, run-of-the-mill side dishes, and are nothing special. Fillers, I guess, in case you're still hungry. But that's all salad, rice and beans are good for, anyway. The seafood main courses were outstanding.

I'm not sure why some of the other reviewers have gotten bunched up about the employees speaking Spanish and the menus having Spanish text on them (the english translation for each menu item is on the menu, too). So if you really can't handle the Spanish, just point at what you want on the menu. They'll get it right, I promise."}
{"text":"Awesome food. If you're here to order something like a chicken taco or a beef burrito then go away. This place has some incredible seafood!!! The complimentary appetizer served once you sit down is outstanding. The food is very well seasoned and comes in large portions. Yes, the prices are leaning towards the high side but I thought it was well worth it. The service we received was good and our waitress was sweet but it was clear that they had other customers who received higher priority than we did. Maybe the owners family and friends?"}
{"text":"The entrees are flavorful and the horchata is decent, but I can't get over the terrible sides that come with dinner entrees. Limp iceberg \"salad\", sad, mealy french fries, and white rice with frozen mixed veggies drag the main entree down. The complimentary shrimp ceviche tostadas that come at the beginning of the meal is nice. The service was fairly prompt on the Sunday night when we went. Not sure if I would go back. Sides are not the main attraction but they are terrible enough to detract from the meal."}
{"text":"Went here spontaneously for Memorial Day Dinner. 

Cute island/tropical Mexican decor. Seems like a family run place with polite, prompt service. 

The menu has your typical Mexican fare with the addition of a full spectrum of seafood dishes. I think gringos like me forget that Mexican cuisine spans much further in many directions, especially coastal seafood. 

We ordered crab legs, raw oysters, and cooked shrimp in their special sauce. The food was a tad salty, and the oysters weren't outstanding. I would stick to the cooked seafood in the future. There was also a delightful ceviche that came out with the tortillas.

Overall not a bad place, but the cost can ramp up quickly depending on what you order."}
{"text":"Really good food and wonderful customer service! Will definitely be going back here. A friend and I went for lunch on a Saturday. Right away our server brought out tostadas and ceviche. The ceviche was to die for! I ordered the shrimp burrito and she the shrimp tacos. We ended up swapping our meals half way through. Both dishes were amazing!  All throughout our meal the waitstaff was checking to see if we needed anything even though they were very busy."}
{"text":"I love their fish tacos (you can get them soft or hard shell- I tried hard shell once and I prefer mine soft shell). 2 or 3 tacos for a meal is perfect. They give you fresh cerviche (instead of salsa) to munch on while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"Wow, some of the best coastal Mexican food I've ever had, hands down! 

So who needs to go on vacation to get this type of food. Not this person.

Free chips with seafood Ceviche as your wait person greats you. Good horchata and blended drinks. Oh yeah they have a wide assortment of Mexican beers and sodas. But the food is amazing. A very large menu. Many of the dishes share a similar yet very different spice combination that makes them all worth trying. I have been to there Madison location more than a dozen times and haven't had the same thing twice. All were great, some seasoned better than others, but all great. 

I look forward to going to this establishment and even crave it at times."}
{"text":"I guess this place is ok if you like an ambiance with Spanish boxing. The service is very slow but kind. Everything comes with stale tostadas and saltines, very hot salsa, and seafood ceviche, which was good. Salsa too hot for me. Margaritas arrived 14 minutes later and were weak. We ordered the fish tacos for $2.59 which were friend and decent with a sauce (were they even fish?). Won't be back. Didn't like ambiance or the stale tostadas"}
{"text":"Love that they serve ceviche and chips as a complimentary appetizer. Guacamole is really fresh and phenomenal. I had grilled shrimp and steak tacos. Can't really go wrong with those. The down side is my friend had the camarones a la plancha and the shrimp were over cooked. I've been there other times and the food has always been great. I would go again."}
{"text":"La gente que pone 5 estrellas a este lugar a lo
Mejor es conocida del due√±o o de los empleados! La comida est√° bien pero el servicio es muy p√©simo no se si el due√±o o el manager de ese lugar se dar√°n cuenta que tipo de gente trabajan ah√≠, la verdad yo no lo recomiendo, solo de ver todas las caras de gente amargada!"}
{"text":"The drinks were good! AND the food was edible BUT a few things were definitely an affront to fine dining. 

Both our entrees were extremely overpriced for what you get. Most regular entrees on the menu are either shrimp, tilapia or snapper. Basically the least expensive seafood there is. But the prices are what you'd expect from a gourmet menu (~$14-$23).

There was nothing fancy about our food, in fact, it was quite the opposite. My shrimp came with white rice, French fries, and garlic bread.(?) And a decent iceberg salad. All very cheap, cheap carbs, not to mention laughably out of place!! I was expecting *seasoned* rice, maybe Spanish or yellow? Basmati at least? But nope, plain short-grain rice with frozen vegetables mixed in. Never seen anything quite like that at any restaurant before. 'Twas bizarre. And Not okay for $14. The shrimp was good but the sauce it came in was kinda greasy and not the yummy flavored kind of grease. It had that faint taste of cheap margarine that seems to be the sloppy go-to for too many Latin joints. :( 
Hubby got chicken enchiladas. They were ok but certainly nothing special. Also came with limp undercooked fries?!? 
Unfortunately this place was not worth a return trip. I hear the tacos are pretty decent though.
But gosh, those margaritas were good!"}
{"text":"VERY COOL RESTAURANT!!!!
Ceviche wasn't really what I expected, but it was very tasty and turned out to be a great appetizer. 
Also tried a few specialties, the huge combo platter with every piece of seafood on it. They are very generous in the amount of seafood given! As for the crab legs, you know you're in the Midwest so nothing much to complain about. The flavor of the crab legs is very good. Also tried the pasta. It was sour and spicy, but very refreshing.
My favorite was the seafood cocktail. The staff recommended us to try hot cocktail instead of cold. It was like a warm bowl of soup with TONS of seafood in it! Very interesting."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times when I am in Madison. They have the best margaritas. The fish tacos are the best. I have never had bad service and I like the authentic Mexican feel. 
If you are looking for good Seafood Mexican food and strong margaritas...this is the place."}
{"text":"So I can't speak to the lobster or higher ticket items as I've only had the fish tacos.. But seriously Madison.. Best fish tacos EVER! So good and unique that every time I come here I have no desire to order anything else. The taco consists of small little pieces of fish with the usual assortment of onions, cilantro, tomatoes and cheese mixed in between a corn tortilla... But the holy shit moment is their own sweet aioli concoction that you put on the taco! It's everything you could want but never had imagined. Eat it!"}
{"text":"The beauty of having random date days with my husband is the fact that lunch dates are a lot quieter than dinner ones.  In fact at 11:45 am we weren't entirely sure if the restaurant was open.  The sign declared \"yes\" so we went in.

There is ample parking here and you must ignore the drive-in window from when the building was previously a fast food place.  I loved what looks like hand painting over the brown tile for decor and there are also other tropical and beach decor to complete their theme.  It's not awesome, but that's ok.

What stands out in this restaurant is the food.  It was phenomenal.  The menu is full of seafood meals galore and upon seating you are greeted with hot crispy tortilla shells and salsas.  There was a fresh ground shrimp salsa that I could have eaten with a spoon.  

I ordered a garlic shrimp dish.  The shrimp were large, meaty and much to my husband's dismay, very garlicky.  I still taste garlic and there shouldn't be any vampires near me for a few days at least.  The shrimp is served with fries, fresh salad veggies that were lovely and crisp, a piece of garlic bread that managed the perfection of a hot crispy outside and fluffy inside.  The rice was not mediocre, it also had bits of veggies in it, though it wasn't a heavy fried rice.  I couldn't finish my meal even though I wanted to.

The service was spotty, great at some moments and then overlooked at others and I wasn't fond of the tv blaring a soap opera in Spanish, but the food was still worth a 4 star review."}
{"text":"Prices have gone up, but the quality seems to be just as good.  Very sorry to see the increase in prices.  We used to go twice a month, but it'll only be once a month from now on because of the increase.   Too bad."}
