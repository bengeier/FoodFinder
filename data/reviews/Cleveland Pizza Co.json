{"text":"sub sandwiches are large and wonderful.come in a cardboard box which keeps them warm without the steam you get from Styrofoam .we usually  get the Italianio and the meatballl sub.Pizzas are quite good.make sure you pay attention to sauces.accidently got the sweet red sauce on pizza and we did not like it. The specialty pizza with pepperoni and cheese is great.even the deep fried mushrooms,while nothing special  come with a dill sauce that takes them to a whole nother level. all in all one of the better pizza shops in lake county."}
{"text":"i friggin love this place! its the only pizza my diva husband really wants to order locally. get the fried dough with chocolate sauce, holy merde! also veginator calzone and strombolis perfect for me (a vegetarian) and for my carnivores they have amazing subs, wings etc."}
{"text":"I used to order from them 2 maybe 3 times a week. And big orders at that.... As of today they will no longer get my money! I ordered 2 salads last week only got one, even tho I paid for both. Well I go to order today and they have in my account that I get the price of a salad off due to last weeks mix up. Well the manager today told me I could not use my military discount and get the money owed to me off, it was one or the other! And then the delivery boy was a rude little SOB! I was polite to him until he started giving me crap. NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM THEM!"}
{"text":"Stopped there for a Italiano Sub.  What a waste of $9.99.  If there was meat on it, we couldn't taste it, or see it.  Cheese??  Compared to other sub shops in our area it was terrible.  Last time they will see us, will never go back.
No rating, they don't deserve a one.  But I have to rate them to post this."}
{"text":"Called in and was told that it would be 40 minutes for delivery and I told them that I would pick up the pizza's instead. They told me that it would be 25 minutes. and I arrived in 25 minutes and they had not even started the pizza. The girl behind the counter was eating a cookie when she walked up to the desk. When I posted comments on their Facebook page about the lack of service I received a nasty response stating that I called back and changed the order. That did not happen. No customer service skills and no concern for the customers time. Second time we had issues with picking up a pizza here so we will not return."}
{"text":"I love their pizza!! The ingredients were fresh. Nice and hot food. Awesome service. And speedy delivery!! Awesome job Cleveland Pizza!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite local pizza places. The buffalo chicken and chicken club are great!"}
{"text":"Calzones are amazing!!! Pizzas really good! Salads are yummy! Pretty quick delivery, sometimes even under the time given!"}
{"text":"We ordered for the first time last night and I was pleasantly surprised. The dough was really fresh, just the right amount of sweetness, and NOT GREASY which is a true bonus for me.  We got the spicy sauce and it paired well with the sweetness of the dough.  I love that they give you sauce options.  It was also a nice big, round, traditionally cut pizza. 

We will be ordering from here from now on.  I may need to write a second review after multiple orders, but this pizza shop deserves to be recognized."}
{"text":"The staff was ok, but their customers must all be on Crack because the one behind me got his order put it in his car then looked at me and called me a bitch in parking lot, and proceeded to cuss me out ...the reason ..I still don't know, then a van pulls up with a couple in it he is yelling at her saying why the 'F' did you order from here, he gets out the car slams the door, and last the delivery guys are in the parking lot arguing (THE ARE ACTUALLY SITTING IN SEPARATE CARS ARGUING ) well one gets mad at the other and speed off.This is a Zoo!! I'm sitting in my car waiting for my pizza now all this just actually happened!! Now I'm looking in the place the staff is laughing and dancing...Wow where is management! !! I guess this would be my last time whether the food is good or not!"}
{"text":"This place never lets me down, frequent diner via delivery and pick up. 

Their pizza is exceptional, and their delivery service is timely, courteous, and professional. 

Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza I have ever had. We order from here at least once or twice a month and are always pleased! 

Last night was no exception - we ordered a large pepperoni with traditional sauce and a some spicy garlic wings and were quoted an hour wait. We received everything hot and fresh in less than a half hour! 

Delivery guys are always pleasant and never have trouble finding our tricky condo! 

We will never order from anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Wings are awesome, very meaty! Baked potato pizza and Hawaiian pizza are my favs.... Never had anything bad from there.  Even the delivery drivers are friendly!"}
{"text":"We've ordered here quite a bit since moving to Euclid. Its refreshing to finally have a yummy place to get pizza delivery. They are friendly, fast, accommodating and offer online ordering."}
{"text":"Cleveland pizza company dishes out high quality pies in large portions. I strongly prefer CPC to the other chains near the lake county/ Cuyahoga county border. 

The pepperoni plunge is one of my favorite pizzas around.  The seasoning, cheese blend and amount of pepperoni are consistent, and never soggy or greasy.  I recommend the spicy red sauce over the more traditional sweet red sauce.

I will say Cleveland Pizza Co. can be pricey, but the larges seem bigger than most places, and they always have great coupons. Also, the delivery times have burned me enough that I know only do carryout orders, and usually place them online because calling in an order takes longer."}
{"text":"Love their subs and salads. Phone service is subpar. Takes some time to get a delivery but 9 out of 10 times it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This was are Sunday night pizza choice and overall it was a good experience.  We ordered a thin crust family size and a deep dish, we place the order online and within 3 min i got a call telling me they where out of deepdish crust (major let down) so they asked if a traditional crust would be okay but did not offer any discount since they did not have the deepdish, i said okay since i did not want to wait longer and order elsewhere.  Are food arrived quicker then expected and was hot and fresh both pizzas where very good but topping were thrown on very inconsistent and very sparce.  The funnel cake fries were the best and cheapest thing we got, with those issues and the $61 bill for the 2 pizza's and funnel cake fries i dont feel it is worth the price for inconsistent pizza making and lack of menu items and for that reason im not sure if i will be ordering or recommending this place in the future."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite pizza and they have the best honey mustard wings and ranch dressing. I've been coming here for a while and always receive great customer service and awesome non chain pizza!"}
{"text":"Great Fathers Day lunch! Italian sub and corn dogs are very tasty  best dipping sauce!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places. Easy online ordering, great menu choices, fast delivery, great food every time I order it."}
{"text":"Closest pizza to my NY standards!! Decent price for your normal pizza's. Always here within given time frame.  Buffalo chicken pizza is delicious (needs more hot sauce though). While I'm living here, this will do!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE pizza in Lake county! The cheese blend they use is the best!!! Yummy appetizers too! Mini corn dogs with signature honey mustard are great and so are the wings! Keep it up CLE PIZZA CO!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here twice in the past month and a half. Something has changed with this place. The attention to detail is definitely on the decline. The first order we got the extra spices added to the pizzas (extra charge) it looked like whatever they used lost its cap and dumped on the middle of the pizzas. The $7 in extra sauces we ordered were half wrong, disappointing m, when the pizza is priced so high anyways. The delivery people have been going down hill as well. The last girl handed me my receipt to sign and I had to run to my office for a pen. Obviously I'd have a pen at my house, but if you're working for a tip maybe make the customer do less work. After all that's why people order delivery. I think we're going back to just being Giuseppe's people. It's worth the drive to pick it up. High prices but still a better value than Cleveland pizza co. And we like the consistency of good quality food."}
{"text":"Loaded Baked Potato Pizza. Yes!

Random pizza shops are a dime-a-dozen in any neighborhood. Cleveland Pizza Co. opened around a year ago in my hood. It took me forever to check them out because I foolishly assumed they would be blah like almost every other pie joint in my area. I was proven wrong. And sometimes I like to be wrong.  

Their pizza isn't anything out of this world. It's not wood-fired, rustic, etc. It's just better than average, good, decent pizza. They do have some fairly unique specialty pizzas. Like I mentioned above, I tried the Loaded Baked Potato pie and it was very tasty. I'm eager to try some of the others. Cheesesteak?! 

I'd probably give them 3 stars but I just checked their website and was almost blown away by how awesome it is. Any restaurant that has a thorough website with full menu and pricing just may get another star from here on out."}
{"text":"Last night it took another shot at a yelp review for pizza place we contacted the Cleveland pizza company we ordered a medium thin crust and medium thick crust pepperoni pizzas with traditional sauce and a order of onion rings the pizza was delivered hot and fresh the sauce was good the cheese is adequate and that Crust  was great the onion rings though could need a little help they were frozen out of a bag but other then that it was all good"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have ever had Cleveland Pizza Company pizza-This pizza has topped my go to pizza joint of callas in Willowick-CPC does not skimp on the topping at all like most pizza places do-My only complaint is there could be a little more sauce put onto the pizza but all I would had to of done is ask for it and I'm sure that would not of been a problem-Ee got two medium pizza's last night cost us $16.00 plus a delivery fee-little pricey in my opinion for to medium 8 cut  but good pizza"}
{"text":"This place delivered to our location for over a year.  Placed an order tonight on line and received a call that they don't deliver to our location and never have. We are .8 miles out of delivery area.  Guess they don't need the business.  Will never go there again plenty of good pizza places that appreciate the customer."}
{"text":"Love the Pizza and Wings ...Great deliver, and the Ranch Dressing is to Die for!"}
{"text":"Our first time here we got large pepperoni pizza, garlic bread with cheese, and honey BBQ wings. The pizza was greasy but that good kind of greasy that you look for with a decent pizza now I'm not saying all pizza has to be greasy but it's good some times. We absolutely loved the garlic bread it was gooey with a lovely sauce. My husband loves wings and we both liked these the honey BBQ sauce was a little sweet on the first bite but the lovely spice came out at the end which was needed. Now this is not the best pizza, garlic bread, and wings that we have ever had but it was good which is why I am giving it 4 stars they were in the weeds and still only took 30 minutes to get everything out so good for them."}
{"text":"Ordered today and it was definitely an off night for Cleveland pizza. Garlic Parmesan wings were just breaded wings with no sauce on them and the pizza had so much grease the whole bottom of the box was soaked. Hoping they just have new people and that this is not the new norm"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  They delivered to us for over a year.  Place an order tonight and the manager calls and says he won't deliver and they never deliver to our area.  Really we only purchased around a dozen times and you delivered every time.  Oh and we are .8 miles out of their delivery area.  Guess they don't need the business."}
{"text":"Just started working around the corner from here. 
Ordered delivery. Was here in less time than quoted, delivery guy was very pleasant, even complemented our office set up.
Price was pretty fair. Happy the fries stayed crisp and the sub was still warm. 
Definitely going to use them more during my time here.
Josh"}
{"text":"Tried this place while in town and I will say that my sub (Italiano) was good but the chicken parm was less than stellar (super sweet sauce). 

Next time I'll try the pizza"}
{"text":"If I order pizza delivery, this is my go to. Their pizza tastes fresh and isn't as greasy as the other Big Box chains. Their ingredients taste fresh and their employees are very nice. Their loaded baked potato pizza is the best. I love potatoes on pizza. They also make their own ranch for dipping and I could drink it straight it is so delicious. 

Please support this company instead of crumbly Marcos, Dominos, Pizza Hut, or any boring chain pizza shop.

Cleveland Pizza Company is Cleveland's own. Hope they can open a store on the Westside at some point."}
{"text":"Really solid pizza in large portions for a super good price. Very much has this place become one of my go-to's."}
{"text":"Ordered at 7 on a Friday. Told it would be an hour (no big deal) took over 2 hours and was Luke warm. Threw it away and got gross McDonalds instead. Chicken fingers soggy pizza gross. They comped the meal but that still didn't make up for making us all hangry and wasting our time."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and wings. The wings are huge and meaty and the sauces they have pair well with the wings. The pizza is very fresh and delicious along with the phenomenal customer service."}
{"text":"Good pizza with a nice variety of sauce options. Consistency of the crust can vary pretty dramatically from visit to visit. One time it was thick and dense and not too appetizing, but another time it was thinner and fluffy. The place is staffed almost completely by teens though so that is to be expected. Nevertheless, I'll take it over most national chains and some regional chains."}
{"text":"So pizza Friday is something in our house and this time we wanted to try something different. A friend recommended this place. I was able to order online and it was a easy process! Then when we go there for pick up- it was about a 2 minute wait and I was serviced. The cashier was super polite and my food was hot and ready!  Everyone in my family enjoyed it. Only reason they are getting 4 out of 5 is because they don't have a store that will deliver to my home. But great 1st impression. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great traditional pizzas and a sides. The staff is always friendly and accommodating if there are any issues."}
{"text":"The best pizza place for the best price in this area! The have a lot of options, and while I recommend their app, it has caused me some problems because I kind of go crazy when I order and get too much!!!  That's not a bad thing for CPC though. Make sure you save the rewards bucks on your pizza box because I wasn't aware they existed til recently!!"}
{"text":"This place is slightly better then just ok. It seems a little expensive to me for what you get but it is good I guess, this parking lot is a mess when it is busy though."}
{"text":"This place is good stuff. Their selection of specialty pizza's is pretty big for a take out place and their topping and sauce options are amazing. Very highly recommend the spicy red sauce and the ranch for something different. They also have pastas, calzones, strombolis and subs. Also, each box has some \"Cleveland Pizza Cash\" on it, to use toward future purchases. When we are in the mood for a quick easy lunch or dinner, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Used to order from them weekly. Now I'll never order from them again. Every time I order from them they act like I'm ruining their day by trying to order their food. The staff is incompetent and rude. They screw up your order more often then they get it right. When confronted with a customer service issue their response is either \"not my problem\" or \"I don't care\". If you want to be treated like an inconvenience rather than a customer order from these half wits."}
{"text":"I was reached out to by a member of the Customer Service team about my previous issues. They worked with me and assured me that the issues would be taken care of. I will up the review back up to 5 stars once I am able to give them another try and receive satisfactory service and I am very happy with how well they handled this!"}
{"text":"Had these opportunity to try a couple of their sheet pizzas at a recent work detail and I was not impressed.  On the plus side, the sausage pizza had very large chunks of sausage, but on the downside, the crust is white bread, flavorless and bland.  The sauce was thin, not enough of it to even rate it.  All in all it was just a forgettable pizza experience."}
{"text":"I got a veggie sub, veggie calzone and antipasto salad. The sub would have been amazing except that it was drowning in dressing. The bun was so soggy it was falling apart and very hard to eat. The calzone was eh. Good toppings and plenty of cheese but barely any sauce and crust was very thick. Salad was ok, but the ranch dressing had dill seasoning in it and I was not expecting that. I wanted normal ranch. Place is ok if your favorite pizza joint is closed. Also delivery guy didn't even attempt to come inside building. Called me before he was even parked and asked me to come down. Those who go the extra mile get that extra tip. My favorite pizza joint always brings it right to my door."}
{"text":"Changed menu to a la carte & no more chicken parm......adios!!
Margherita pizza no longer made w fresh basil...dried stuff out of a shaker& it totally makes it no longer worth it to buy one. Stick w the meats & veggie toppings on their reg pizzas, those are still good! 
Subs aren't so good, very stingy w the meat, so go somewhere else if you prefer meat on your subs! Ok taste, but pitiful, the sub roll was twice as big as what you get inside!"}
{"text":"It's really not that good I like to support it when I come home (Timberlake) and visit my parents only because I like to support anything Cleveland related and I like to support small businesses but is not that delicious.  But still Yumma!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this relativity new pizza place to Mentor a try,  have to say, unimpressed. Online ordering was very easy to use. Ordered a large, regular crust garlic sauce pizza & a Cleveland Burger. First, pizza was ready when I arrived & order was correct. Now, to the actual food. I would say that the crust was a bit overlooked for my taste. It was quite crisp but not burnt. I felt like the sauce was non existent. I understand that garlic sauce is a light sauce, but I have had some great garlic sauces. Plus having only cheese, I should be able to taste garlic. Overall, bland. Now the Cleveland Burger - think a Roman Burger. I would venture they cook the burger in the pizza oven. The edges of the burgers are extremely crispy, yes, crispy. Even with the Italian dressing, cheese, tomato & lettuce, it still crunched when I bit into it. I would be a good sandwich if the burger was properly cooked. Sorry, I don't like crunchy burgers.  With so many options in Mentor for pizza, I think I will stay with my tried and true favorite."}
{"text":"Last week I called 7 times to no answer around 11 am. This review may change once I taste the quality of the food. It very poor customer service, the quality of the food can't be that great if your not willing to get the orders needed and answer calls that was a loss of 48.00 plus on there end.

Update: good portion less then 48.00 how ever lots of sodium which isn't a bad thing the mozzarella sticks where really really good, and the pizza was okay. Just hydrate well before eating the pepperoni specialty they sell."}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken pizza is to die for! They never disappoint! They're super fast too! Always delivers in under 45 minutes!"}
{"text":"The managers from CPC reached out to me after they was how dissatisfied I was with my last order. They asked me to give them another chance and I did. When I ordered the food it was great! I'm happy I decided to give them another chance. They went out of the way to help me rectify the problem. I look forward to eating there again soon."}
{"text":"I love the Cleveland Pizza Company. They make quality pizza with a nice selection. I am now a Vegan, and order their Vegginator pizza without cheese with sweet sauce. It is hard to find a good vegetable pizza and this is the best I have found. Give them a try!"}
