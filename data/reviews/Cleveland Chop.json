{"text":"I am in Cleveland for work and looked up beat steak house. This was apparently it. I had a good caesar salad with the special, flank steak over potatoes. The caesar was good the steak would have been good had that seasoning on it not tasted burnt. But the potatoes were cold and I wonder if they has been reheated from last night or earlier in the day. I did finish the steak but left the potatoes in a great cherry sauces (sauce was good had it not been on the potatoes) mostly uneaten. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good food, atmosphere, and good craft beer selection.  Priced right and we got great service- would recommend to friends"}
{"text":"If your looking for a nice bar to have a good meal at them grab a beer and a strip steak here, it's great.  Prices are better than some of the upscale places near by and the steaks are great quality."}
{"text":"Went for brunch here today. Service was terrible. Steaks were sent back because they were not prepared right pancakes sent back because they were not cooked in the middle. No jelly served with toast. No butter served with pancakes I asked for butter she never brought it. Asked for jelly she brought one little packet.  Our waitress looked like she rolled herself in crumbs before she came to work her clothing was so dirty. Never brought an ashtray as we were sitting outside and could smoke. What happened here?"}
{"text":"Food was average and WAY over priced.  I had a much more detailed review before they took their first listing off yelp.  Beer is way over priced at $5 dollars a pint for domestics, $4 at happy hour.  you can get much better deals other places in the warehouse district.  If they change their prices and up the quality a bit, it will be a nice place."}
{"text":"I would have loved to give this place 5 stars.  The beer selection was great, the bar tenders were cool and knowledgeable.   The only thing they did wrong was the music. My buddy and i had to leave it was so bad.  Classic rock please!"}
{"text":"Another great restaurant Cleveland should be proud of. My fiance and I visited for the first time during the 8th Annual Downtown Cleveland Restaurant week. We each had the NY Strip with Risotto. The steak was cooked perfecly and paired nicely with my Basil Hayden on the rocks. Our server Dori, was terrific and made us feel right at home. She even offered to take a picture of us which my fiance gladly took her up on.  The setting is casual with a very classy wide open feel. Definitely a place I could stop for a drink after work. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Took advantage of the Travelzoo coupon and we're happy we did so.  Excellent service from the hostess to the young man who brought water as soon as we were seated to our server, JaJa (hope that's spelled correctly) who came by about two minutes after we were seated.  She's very good at her job.. Ordered Steak Cigars and Bloody Mary Shrimp, very, very good. Then Wedge Salad and Caesar, as good as it gets.  Could have stopped right there because of the size of the portions, but  ordered the 10 oz Filet Oscar and Catch of the Day, steak was perfect, fish very tasty. Then ended with Brownie Sundae and Cheesecake.  Absolutely everything was hot when it was supposed to be hot and cold when it was supposed to be cold.  Very nice atmosphere, great staff and excellent food.  Try this place again if you went once and were not satisfied.  Really, really worth a second chance.  My friend is very hard to please when it comes to food and even he did not have one complaint.  That rates 6 stars."}
{"text":"Just had two amazing apps, the ahi poke tacos minus slaw, fresh seared tuna, pineapple soy and guac, and my new fav - fried oysters, cornmeal breaded and served in a bed of sautéed spinach, onions, chopped pork belly and chipolte mayo on the half shell.  One of the best apps I've ever eaten. Excellent size portions and just downright delicious. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Awesome late lunch.  Visiting OH for the Hall of Fame tour ~ stopped in for a late lunch.  Was pleasantly surprised at the options and the prices.  Great service, and the food was really good.  Nice house wine, and micro brews."}
{"text":"When I still lived in Cleveland my boyfriend and I used to go to this place and order a barbecue chicken pizza and some wine all the time. We were addicted, and we dragged all of our friends there whenever we could. From the reviews it seems this place has gone downhill since then. That makes me sad. On the other hand I never ordered a steak here so perhaps you should all try the pizzas."}
{"text":"The pizza we had was great, but the mussels were way below par. We got a flight of beers made by the local brewery, and were sorely depressed with their lack of taste.  The service was great and again the pizza was very good. I give it three stars based on this."}
{"text":"Chop has a great happy hour menu and the cheapest beer I've had in Cleveland. Server was friendly and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I had the filet- the entrees can be pricey- but it was delicious. I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I have been too the Chop House many times in the past for cocktails, dinner and most often lunch.  It is pricey, but I have always enjoyed the quality food and better then average service.    Yesterday, I was enetertaining clients for lunch and chose the Chop House as I often had in the past.   One of my guests ordered the seafood cobb salad and what came out of the kitchen was a gigantic bowl of greens, three shrimp and a tad more then a tablespoon of crab meat.  I asked the server about it and she said that was the proper amount.    I am certainly not cheap, but that was embarrassing to present so little value for a $16 lunch salad, especially when entertaining guests."}
{"text":"Tried this place from the reviews on yelp and once again yelp is right on.  Our server Lauren was great.  They bring Jalapeño  corn bread to start and it was really good.  We tried the fish taco appetizer and a bowl of crab bisque. All was fantastic.  Our main course was again very good and priced reasonably.  Over all a very nice place to eat."}
{"text":"We came for my birthday with the Travelzoo voucher.  The appetizers were great we got calamari and muscles.   Our steakd were cooked perfectly. Amanda was our server and she could not have done a better job. She took very good care of us."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Cleveland Chop this weekend and enjoyed our visit. I had the tenderloin tips and boyfriend had the house burger- both meals were more than what we expected, very delicious and good quality. Atmosphere is romantic and servers were very helpful in selecting meals and providing service. They also serve cornbread in a cast iron skillet instead of your typical bread basket, which I found very creative (and delicious!)"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT happy hour! Strolled in on a Friday afternoon, great prices and their happy hour appetizers are just as generous as the main dinner appetizers. My husband and I had two drinks each and split an appetizer for $37!"}
{"text":"Ate here on recommendation from the hotel staff from the Marriott.  Good beer selection and speedy service.  Great when grabbing a late dinner with the kids."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great, otherwise the food is pretty good. Would definitely stick to happy hour here and dinner somewhere else.  Good atmosphere, nice staff.  parking across the street."}
{"text":"Amazing. Thanks yelp. We searched online for a steak house and no disappointment here. Started with calamari and it was great. I had steak... perfect my husband had shrimp and gnocchi he wants me to make it at home. My son had ribs and they were delicious too. Waitress was wonderful and my wine was perfect. Fun, cool atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Why pay megabucks for XO when Chop House is every bit as good, better for my taste (although XO, Hyde Park and others have much better selection of sides)?  This is my standby for a good steak and risotto!  And the cornbread in a skillet . . . Mmm! Good beer selection, ok wine choices, friendly atmosphere, food NEVER disappoints!"}
{"text":"The Cleveland Chophouse is an average steakhouse in the Warehouse District. I was there for lunch today and walked into a nearly empty restaurant (granted it was 2 in the afternoon). The restaurant itself is very nice, the exposed brick and the high ceilings add a nice feel to it. We sat ourselves at a table in the bar area. My biggest complaint of the meal was how slow the service was. There were few people in the restaurant, yet we went long periods of time without seeing our waiter. I couldn't figure out why. I will say this though; while our waiter was slow, he was very helpful as someone in our party had severe food allergies and he helped this person choose what would be safe for him to eat. We ordered a Beef Bourbon Pizza for the table. It was a pizza with cheese, sirloin beef, grilled onions, and tomatoes with a steak sauce base. The pizza was good, but it wasn't spectacular. The crust was excellent, but I feel the pizza was lacking substance. Overall, if you're in the Warehouse District and are looking for a safe place to eat, the Chophouse is good, but there are better options nearby."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SERVICE, AMAZING BEER!!! I have read several of the reviews on this site and can't help but wonder where the pathetic need to tarnish a reputation comes from. I can't tell you how many restaurants I have tried since living in Cleveland, an how terribly unimpressed I have been with not only the sad, small, over thought dishes I have received, but more so with the incredibally poor and inefficient service I have received. So as a frequenter of the Chophouse I can honestly say that the food is great, portions are enormous!!!, the beer is amazing (if you think it's flavorless, move past the light lager, because that beer is made for those of you with bland taste) and the service staff is exceptional. The Chophouse may not be an every night kinda place, but for special occasions, business dinners, and first time in Clevelanders this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We went Sunday for a valentine dinner, place not crowded good atmosphere , started off great service was excellent, apper. Was great \" chicken tenderloin \", I order a 24oz porterhouse along with a lobster tail, the steak was crisp burnt, the tail had no flavor or taste what so ever ,and hard to cut,  the wife order porkchop, and it was dry no taste either , for $150, I expected a wow factor, let me tell you I will not ever go there again. Can anyone tell me who has a great wow factor steak in Cleveland ? ! ,"}
{"text":"Yum, I had the tuna and my boyfriend had a steak, both of which were delicious.  It was pretty empty when we went in here on a Friday around 9:30, but I think that was because the Cavs were playing in town that night.  We also got to see LaBron's winning shot!  The mashed potatoes were amazing and drinks were strong :)  I would recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly floored at the number of low ratings for this place, so I felt a moral obligation to provide my thoughts lol  Been here a number of times for dinner, brunch, and happy hour.  Always had great service, always been delighted at the meal.  It's an upscale, but comfortable dining experience at a great value. Happy hour has delicious bites and the deserts are excellent.  Definitely don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Live downtown and decided to hit the Chophouse with a group of friends for a later happy hour.  They have always been known to have a great happy hour that goes untill 9PM on Fridays.  In the past the happy hour menu consisted of pizzas, sliders, and about 15 other items.  We used to rush over at 6PM and fight for a table in the bar area.  The place used to be jammed!! Not anymore.  Walked right in at 6:50PM on a Friday and the place was dead.  My buddy and I were thrilled we didn't have to stand around and scope out a table when people were leaving.  The waitress came over and was very nice.  She handed us the Happy Hour menu and told us we had 4 mins to order since happy hour is now over at 7PM.  The menus didn't have any of the old happy hour food other than onion rings and chicken fingers.  It was a total shame.  We asked the waitress what happened and her reply was great.    \"This place sold out to the Gordon Biersch chain and they have ruined us.\"  I respect that she was honest and knew how great this place used to be.  With the weather turning to winter what a shame they ruined the best thing going.  It will only take one slow winter for them to realize their mistakes.  Hopefully someone from managment reads these reviews as an overall 3 stars for a steakhouse is pathetic."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here while visiting the Cleveland area. The food was very disappointing and the service was slow. Both of our dishes were very bland, steak included. Service was kind of slow but the waitress was nice. Would not return."}
{"text":"My overall experience here tonight was laughably bad from start to finish. We sat at the bar which seemed like a good idea because there were already about 8 people seated there. The bartender wasn't there when we sat down. When he returned a few minutes later, he didn't even glance in our direction. He spent about 5 minutes chatting with the other people at the bar before I gave up and went to the hostess stand to ask for a table. My bf insisted we be able to see the game though, so we went back to the bar and actually approached the bartender so that he could see us.   My glass of wine had floaties that looked like baby spiders. The appetizer steak cigars were mostly flavorless egg rolls that contained steak bits.   We ordered our food to go. Mistake. My steakhouse cobb salad was supposed to contain blue cheese, egg, tomato, and avocado. I asked for no tomato. So my salad had radish and cucumber on it. Not a big deal but could you mention it on the menu?  There was one tiny piece of avocado (less than an ounce). My \"egg\" was half a deviled egg. Basically the cook was too lazy to locate and peel a hard boiled egg, so he simply threw ONE half of a deviled egg (already made because it is an appetizer item) into the salad. Give me a break.  I've had salads from Wendy's with better presentation, and they cost 1/4 as much.  I've worked in a kitchen and the difference between a good restaurant and a crappy one is whether the cooks on Sunday evenings care enough to prepare things properly. That isn't happening here.   There is no way I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends saturday. Service was Slow. Food mediocre. Friend bit into toothpick found in oreo pie. Hailed waitress she apologized and got them another piece to go. No manager stopped by the table, and they were still charged for pie. Cheesecake very unimpressive."}
{"text":"This is one of my wife's and my favorite places to eat in downtown. I think it is very underrated. We have always had a wonderful time and meal."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch here while passing through Cleveland. Steak salad was fresh with a generous portion of meat; hamburger was equally pleasing. Enjoyed talking to the bar tender about the city. Prices were pretty reasonable. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Came for a late dinner with some friends. The place was not very crowded, but it was also after 8pm...  We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp, which was awesome! There is of course, complementary corn bread in a cast iron pan as well, which was a nice touch.   Between us, we had the salmon and ribeye steak, both of which were well executed. The sauce on the salmon was particularly good. I can't say that it's the best steak around, but it's definitely good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food! Would highly recommend as one of the best restaurants in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Such great food, reasonable price and completely great dining experience.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail and calamari as an appetizer with a few pre-dinner cocktails and the start of our meal was great! The drinks and the appy's were a perfect introduction to The Chop as we couldn't wait for dinner. At the table there was prime rib, ribeye and filet. All steaks were great and our service was fantastic. I would definitely recommend The Chop to anyone heading downtown and looking for an upscale meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Travel Zoo coupon.  We got such a great deal (2 appetizers, 2 soup or salads, 2 entrees, 2 desserts) for $69.    Let me say first, if you are looking for a high end steakhouse, I wouldn't suggest the steak here, while it was good it was a little tougher than I prefer, but then again it didn't cost an arm and a leg (steaks averaged about $30).  The restaurant hasn't changed from the ChopHouse, which is fine, because it is a very nice space.  So we started with appetizers: Bloody Mary Shrimp Cocktail and Ahi Poke Tacos (sesame seared tuna, pineapple soy, spicy mayo) both delicious.  However with the tacos, I don't think it was have made a difference if you had the Ahi on there or not, the pieces of tuna were so small that the other flavors overpowered it.  Still really good though.  Then we both ordered the More Than a Wedge with 'buttermilk dressing, all the fixins'.  The 'fixins' were bleu cheese, 1/2 deviled egg, croutons, tomatoes, cucumbers, bacon, and maybe a few other things.  The salad perfect of the toppings went well together and the amount of dressing was perfectly proportioned.  Next up...our entrees.  I ordered the Filet Diane (3 pepper crust, wild mushroom confit, cognac cream) and he ordered the Bleu Filet (Worcestershire cream sauce, bleu cheese).  We both ordered our steaks medium rare.  His medium rare was more on point, while mine was a bit more on the rare side.  However I didn't mind as that was better than having it come back well done (like other places I have ordered).  The toppings on both were tasty.  We both enjoyed every bite!   Oh yeah...we both ordered the white cheddar mashed potatoes for our side...YUUMMMMM!  And at last...dessert! Creme Brulee and Key Lime Pie.  This is where the meal took a big flop!  The creme brulee tasted like something you would buy from a store.  The caramelized topping was soft, should be a nice crunch when your spoon hits the sugar.  The custard was sub par.  Key Lime Pie...was just okay as well.  Better than the creme brulee I guess.  In the end, the service was great, the food was great, the dessert was blah!  With that said, I will definitely come back here again (even with out the great deal on Travel Zoo).  I totally recommend to anyone to come here."}
{"text":"I've been dining at this restaurant over the past five years when I visit Cleveland for work.  The consistency of the service and quality of the food is too-notch.  Margaret, the manager, always greets you with a warm smile and a kind word. The staff welcomes you as if you're returning home.  The food is always well prepared, flavorful and you won't leave hungry.  Cleveland Chop is a gem in Cleveland's culinary crown."}
{"text":"My review is only for the happy hour experience. There drinks offerings during HH really good and a lot of variety to choose from, not the typical 2 drinks and drafts of other HH. The pizza was good as well as the spinach dip, not super spectacular but it goes well with the nicely crafted $5 drinks. There is a lot of room at the bar area and the waitresses were very attentive even though it was happy hour time. I will definitely recommend this happy hour to anybody that wants good appetizers and really good drinks."}
{"text":"Our waitress Dory, was very nice and attentive. The food was excellent, but it came out a little slow. Other than that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"My review is based on their Happy Hour.  My friends and I came here after running an errand downtown and we found on yelp that they have a good HH and I definitely agree. It was actually very hard to find HH downtown around the W 6th area.   They offer $3 draft beer specials- did you know they have their own beer?! They also offer $4 wine and $5 specialty drinks. They also have a lot of HH food options! This is great because I feel that a lot of places slack on the food offerings but Chop has a ton and we ordered a ton! My friends and I ordered Steak Cigars, Lobster Nachos, Short Rib Bowl and Margharita Pizza. The short rib bowl was out of this world flavorful and I really didn't want to share (ha ha). The lobster nachos actually had decent size pieces of lobster- that's not always the case. For the price we paid for the food (between $6-$8) I feel like we got a steal.   Next time you're downtown looking for a HH make sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first experience dining at the chop house. Everything we read about this place was true. Let me start by saying you have to try the Moscow mule. Then we ordered  steaks that were perfectly cook and so tender.  Plus the cornbread is the best! Service was excellent. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"An amazing Night. Remembered us by Name and an incredible server. Literally have eaten throughout downtown and this place has the \"It Factor\". Put it on your list of must do's."}
{"text":"I always forget about Cleveland Chop but today we stopped there after the Cleveland Film Fest. I got the steak cobb salad- delicious (fresh ingredients, steak cooked perfectly) and the other member in my party got a burger. Both menu items were great. Great quality food and experienced servers. I want to go back for brunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best happy hours downtown. All of their craft beers are $3 and they have some great, affordable cocktails. I got an Ithaca Flower Power IPA and a friend ordered a dirty martini. Their happy hour food selection is also great - with a wide variety of options floating around $5. We ordered some Ahi Poke Tacos and Spinach Artichoke Dip.  Four tiny fried tortillas filled with ahi tuna, avocado, and a tangy sauce - the tacos were delicious. The spinach artichoke dip was also good and served with some crispy pita bread, that I believe had some parmesan and pesto seasoning. Cleveland Chop had some other great HH options including neapolitan stone pizzas and loaded chicken tenders. I will definitely return for happy hour."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Wednesday night to grab a quick bite at the bar.  I mentioned to a friend I was on my way to BRGR 9 and he suggested I stop in at Cleveland Chop because he thought their burgers were good.  So I saddled up to the bar and ordered the Chop House Burger and fries.   The burger arrived undercooked (asked for medium) and the fries were limp. Two strikes.  You're out."}
{"text":"I just moved into the Bingham and my roommate and his family asked if I wanted to join them to the Cleveland Chop. Of course I will like to come, new place! The first thing is that the entrance threw both cohorts off; being my mate's parents went into the wrong door prior to us arriving and then we did. So there are two doors, the front which I think goes to the bar and then another on the right. The immediate left has another door that takes you into another building, we both did that and there is what must be a service entrance that takes you somewhere else and into another building.   Anyways we survived this time. We got in and sat down in a booth, it was very dark but lit up enough to read the menu. It was a nice ambience so I am not complaining let me tell you what. The steaks are variable from aged, well aged, paired combos etc. They are around $30-40 range depending on the cut. We were worn out from the move in and we did not partake in a steak. I got the Beef Tenderloins which was great and the rest of them got burgers. The tenderloins were $22 I believe and they gave with the beef and cheddar mash. You could not really make out the cheddar though as the tenderloin sauce was in plenty and strong. Just the way Eric likes it so I am not complaining let me tell you what. The burgers they got, which I believe were $13 were great size and you got a gracious serving of fries. They were unique fries though, they had a sweet taste that made them very delectable in my eyes. Both my roommate and his father liked them whereas the mother did not, so the fries may not be everyone's favorite slice of pie per se. The table also gets free cornbread which was unbelievable and we ordered a second one which was basically for me since I can eat like no other and it is sitting in my refrigerator waiting for mastication.  Overall, quite the splendid dinner and I certainly recommend this for those visiting Cleveland, particularly the Warehouse district. Very good. Good for friends, family, or romance."}
{"text":"Cleveland Chop has managed to go completely downhill. Is the front of house friendly? Yes. Timely? Yes. Food ideas and recipes on-point? Yes. Food execution good? HELLL NOOO!   For a place that relies on it's steaks as it's income, you'd think that someone in the kitchen would know how to cook one. No such luck on both our plates. NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!! When that is the majority of the meal, it has to be right. Apps were good. My brussels, as my side, were WAY underdone. Worst part is that there were maybe 2 or 3 tables even seated in the WHOLE PLACE on a Friday evening at 6pm and we STILL couldn't get good food. For plopping down well over 150 bucks for two people, you'd think they'd at least have comped a small amount as a goodwill gesture. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Stopped by before a show and this is definitely my kind of place. Not the high end high class high price place but a very nice steakhouse with great food at a fair price. I started with a ginger beer drink because I had never had one before an it turns out I'm not a fan but that wasn't their fault. Next up was jalapeno cornbread with just a hint of jalapeno and was very good. I had a NY strip steak with their \"special\" mashed potatoes and thought both were fantastic. No time for dessert but I absolutely loved the food, the ambiance, and the service and am definitely going back."}
{"text":"I ordered the filet oscar, my husband got the T bone. We both asked for our steaks to be prepared medium rare. Mine was medium and his was closer to rare. I didn't think I would mind a steak that was overcooked, but this just didn't taste good at all.  I get that it isn't easy to cook a filet, but it seems like this place would hire someone who knows how to do it."}
{"text":"I was shocked.  This is a steakhouse which had 5 cuts of beef.  They were out of both the porterhouse and the new york strip.  We didn't find out about this until 1 hr into dinner.  Overall appetizers were good, sides were ok, and steak was great.  Service on the other hand was sub-par.  Overall, I'd say it's good place to eat but for the price its not up to par."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. First of all, I have been to Cleveland Chop several times, but today I had the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant. I called ahead to order and pick up food on my lunch break. The lady on the phone was bitchy and acted like she had no time for me. It's funny because guess who screwed up my order? She did!!! And when she came to apologize, she charged me full price for my order. And when I said something about it, she walked away and acted like she didn't hear me, and when I asked AGAIN she asked me if I come in often and to ask for her next time and it'll be free. LOL. Her name is Margaret and she seems to have been a Manager. I will NEVER go back there just because of her. If you're going to be in the restaurant industry then you better have excellent customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Review after earlier post. At a large business lunch. Order a burger medium well. It comes medium rare at best.  Instead of just picking it and getting a new one the waitstaff argues that I am incorrect. It is properly prepared. Being a large business lunch I was in too awkward a position to properly address the situation.   I would not recommend this establishment. I want to point out there were 3 wait staff that helped the party. It was only one that was an issue. She had blond hair.  Again, the other two ladies were great!  I have tweeted about this. No response. So I take it they don't care."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at Cleveland Chop celebrating my 12th anniversary. We were immediately greeted by our waiter who provided us with a complimentary glass of Prosecco for our anniversary. We came during restaurant week and I ordered the garden salad for my salad, Gouda cheese and bacon stuffed chicken for my entree, and raspberry cheesecake for my desert. My husband ordered the executive cut filet for his dinner. His filet was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. My chicken had an amazing taste and a tasty bacon creamed sauce to go with it. The cheddar potatoes were great and the raspberry cheesecake was perfect. Not to mention every table is given a complimentary skillet of jalapeño cornbread to start. It was so tasty. We paid only $70 + tip for an amazing meal and great service."}
{"text":"I came here during lunch time. I got the grilled cheese with meat and my boyfriend got the hangover burger with sweet potato fries. Nothing really special or exciting about the service or the food. The dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries were good. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes and they did not have much flavor and appeared stiff and old instead of hot and creamy. I thought the meal was average and overpriced. Our waiter seemed inexperienced and seemed like he was rushing us despite the few customers in the restaurant. The aura was nice and more classy than other restaurants I've been too. However, I have heard the Brunches were delicious along with their alcoholic beverages but they only serve them on Sundays."}
{"text":"Clean casual Dress. Waitresses/waiters are on point. We started with the Calamari, very crispy on the out and smooth on the inside. If you like to get this as an appetizer, try this... it's good. Oscar Filet was incredible minus the lack of Crab on top, the Blue Filet was over kill but still extremely delicious. Both could be cut with a butter knife. The Brussels Sprouts were salty, try before you season... and the white cheddar mashed were incredible. The Risotto was very very good, if you are confused on a side, side with the risotto. The corn bread is like dessert, i suggest you do just that, so save it to save room for your dinner, especially because portion sizes are great. One side will feed two.  Atmosphere is cool, very old Cleveland the brick walls are mysterious.  All in all a great place to dine."}
{"text":"Went to Cleveland Chop for the first time with a buddy of mine for Cleveland Restaurant Week and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  We ordered off the special menu along with the app sampler.  The app sampler is HUGE!  This  sampler is more of something about 4 or more people.  Even 3 is going to be pushing it seeing as how much food is on that platter.  To start I had a caesar salad and it was very well done.  Croutons were fresh and crunchy, dressing was just enough and flavor was mild and nice.  Main course I had scallops and shrimp over rice with a leafy vegetables on the side.  This dish was simply delicious!  Scallops were a bit on the smaller side but still fresh.  The sauce they put over the dish was flavorful and the seasoned rice below was cooked very nicely.  Vegetables were a bit overly salty but bearable, especially if eaten together with the rice.  For dessert I ordered their mousse with raspberries on top.  I haven't had a dessert in a restaurant in awhile and I remember why.  It was perfectly whipped and just the right amount of sweetness but the guilt definitely settled in along with the food when dinner was finished.  All 'n all, this was an amazing place worth a try.  I will be back to eat off their regular menu as I saw plenty which caught my attention."}
{"text":"We popped in on a Sunday for lunch on the recommendation of a Sr. local hotel concierge.  I'd requested walking directions to a new local burger joint in downtown Cleveland; he immediately told me I was misguided in our quest for a great burger, and redirected us 2 blocks up from our hotel to Cleveland Chop.    This place is relaxed and laid back, def chill atmosphere without the swank steakhouse pretension, casual dress code.  We were greeted immediately and slunk comfortably into a sweet little booth, and had a most excellent server, Andrea.  The Manager stopped over and we chatted for 10 minutes.  Margaret is the one to ask for if you need anything special or want to know a bit more about the place; she was super welcoming.  Food & Drink:  Solid in both areas.  Numerous draft beers, some local and some not, but all were fine choices for craft beer fans.  Our burger (shared, and split for us w/o asking, back in the kitchen) was a solid 9 in my book.  Fries were outstanding, but back to the burger: large fresh handmade patty, gruyere cheese and a bacon compote, and all the side fixings were fresh and cold, like they'd just been prepped for us.  Ambiance:  cool as hell, 1930's star/glam/local meets 2013 updates: dark wood, lots of booths, large dining area, lots of large historical photos on walls.  Very inviting and relaxing.  If we had had 3 hours to kill and another night at our hotel we might have hung all day there.   Cannot believe these negative Yelp reviews as they are the polar opposite of our experience, but hopefully the restauranteur has listened and has taken the necessary steps with his management staff to resolve all the issues other Yelpers have brought to the forefront.  All I can say is  an absolutely stellar first visit so we'll make a beeline for Cleveland Chop next trip!"}
{"text":"Yummy cornbread great Steak Diane, Steak Oscar & Crab cakes. The Chop Margaritas were delish! Perfect Moscow Mule & good beer selection. Great service from our waitress Heather; very attentive."}
{"text":"I am writing this review based solely on their Sunday brunch.  We were looking for a good place before a Brown's game and this came highly recommended.  Absolutely unbelievable!!  It is a bit pricey, $30/person but the food selection and quality is amazing.  It includes your typical breakfast foods, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.  But then they put out lunch/dinner items and each dish is better than the next.  Come hungry!!  It's perfect before a football game because you will not be hungry until later that evening!  Definitely one of the best brunch spots in the area!"}
{"text":"It's definitely the cheapest of the steakhouses downtown... service at the bar is pretty good as long as there isn't any more than 7 people sitting there. Asked for a steak medium rare and it came out extremely rare. I hate sending food back but I'm not paying 40 dollars for a meal to be cooked wrong. Half way into it, the cook came out behind the bar and gave me a weird look... sorry you don't know how to grill a food that you're known for   Just spend a little more and go across the street"}
{"text":"Brunch was perfectly satisfying. Our waitress Laura was great. Patient, kind, helpful. Food was really quick and very good. Coffee was good. Hangover Burger looked amazing (I wished I ordered it). Chef's Skillet was great. Salmon plate isn't anything to write home about but it was tasty. I will be back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything we had and the price was reasonable. We actually went a few months back so I can't remember the appetizers we got (all good) but the dry aged cuts of meat were phenomenal. They gave us cornbread which was amazing. I was feeling the food coma when we left here but was very satisfied.  The parking is a little rough depending on when you come ( with the location if there is a game it's going to be crazy) so I suggest researching the team schedules ahead of time to know what to expect."}
{"text":"Had been to the bar area for Happy Hour several times before but until last night had not tried a steak. Bar area is very nice and classy without being pretentious.  They have some excellent food and drink specials.   Last night got the 3 course restaurant week menu from which I selected the Onion Soup, Strip Steak and espresso Creme Brulee. We also shared an appetizer platter which had nice variety of selections.  Soup was ok but I wouldn't get again, Steak was good cooked perfectly to medium rare. Desert was wonderful. Honestly they don't have the best steak in town compared to the high end places. This spot has a more relaxed atmosphere then competitors. Good spot for a group of friends. Also if you don't eat steak they have some other lower priced entrees."}
{"text":"Initially, there was no one to greet me and my guest at the door. I watched this happen all night. At least one hostess should be present at 6:30 on a Tuesday evening. A manager fiddling in the wine shelf noticed us and then proceeded to show us to a table.   The server was pleasant but I was disappointed that she did not offer us an appetizer or a drink. I ordered them anyway without a recommendation. The cocktail came out in less than two minutes (great!) and the appetizer shortly after. The entrees were good, not great. The lemon demi glace on the chicken picatta was not desirable but my mother's gnocchi tasted like it was made in house.   We were asked if we were finished without being offered after dinner drinks or dessert.   Overall the experience was ok."}
{"text":"This place isn't upscale but it has that feel. I like the layout, tables, furniture, all of it. They also give complimentary sweets while you wait. We got the cinnamon rolls.  I don't like that all of the breakfast meat are pork options! I had the eggs, potatoes and pancakes. Presentation means a lot when it comes to food, and my pancakes looked horrible! However, they tasted really good.   I had a pitcher of the mimosa and the pitcher had too much ice and not enough champagne! The fill the pitcher and then pour you a glass. So don't expect to get a nice buzz from that small pitcher.   I recommend trying the chicken and waffle."}
{"text":"I appreciated the house salad that came with my meal but  was underwhelmed by dinner. Had the Gorganzola Fillets. The cheese and Worcestershire sauce was very tasty. However the two fillets were quite tiny, and they were very skimpy on the mushrooms. Steak was cooked medium rare as requested but the meat itself simply didn't have much taste. The cheddar mashed spuds were ok but could have been hotter. My friend loved the fried calamari and said the onion soup was only ok. Would have given it 3 stars except for the prices charge vs. the food we had."}
{"text":"Brunch:  This is the best brunch place I've found downtown.  It's not as original as a place like Latitude 41, and it's a little pricier than the Inn on Coventry, but I definitely enjoyed it.  The menu is a good mix of traditional and creative, a \"pitcher\" or mimosas (about two wine glasses full) is $7, and everything was good to very good."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a big disappointment after hearing it was one of the best steakhouses in Cleveland.  We had a party of six and we were seated at a table that was really two tables pushed together.  That is fine, except for me, sitting in the middle, I had a place setting with two tables of different heights.  The white table cloth covered it up, but not a good first impression.  My martini was fine as was my shrimp cocktail.  I had the dry aged strip steak which was nicely prepared.  The real disappointment was my side dishes.  The serving of cheddar mashed potatoes was certainly big, but it lacked any sort of creativity or flavor.  It was just potatoes.  My asparagus were even a bigger disappointment.  Again, my portion was big, but there was absolutely no flavor in them.  I ate one, pushed the dish away, and a minute or two went back for another just hoping that they would have some flavor.  Asparagus should jump off the plate with flavor.  These laid buried under a big dollop of butter, kind of like a stack of pancakes.  My one friend sent his steak back two times, once it was overcooked and once it was undercooked.  He didn't have the appetite for the third time.  The stout was very good, and the service was excellent.  Maybe I'm jaded by steakhouses on the east coast, but I don't rate the Chophouse highly."}
{"text":"I had a private event there recently and it couldn't have been better! The private room is warm and inviting as is the staff. The food tasted as good as it looked! The cornbread was delicious, the sound system was great, and Margaret was a joy to work with. Looking forward to my next event there!"}
{"text":"I came in for work lunch on a Saturday.  Yeah, you heard me right, work lunch on a Saturday.    The atmosphere is that of a old steakhouse (similar to a casual Smith and Wolensky's or a Palm Steakhouse, key word casual).  It was pretty quiet with a bunch of football games playing in the background.  Despite the how quiet the restaurant is, the service was pretty slow.    A co-worker ordered a large beer battered onion rings, which is supposed to be their popular item, according to the server.  Unfortunately the onion rings lacked any seasoning or any real flavor.  It needed more salt on the rings, at a minimum.  The waitress brought out onion ring sauce to compensate, but good onion rings shouldn't need a dipping sauce.   I had a chicken cobb salad, usually a pretty safe bet.  The cobb salad was served in this delightful refrigerated metal bowl, which kept the salad fresher for a little longer.  Luckily, I got the dressing on the side with my salad, my co-worker's salad was completely drenched in caesar dressing.  The cobb salad was mixed well, definitely a large portion for your pricing.  Again, it was a plain salad.    Will have to return and try a few of their other dishes, next working lunch.."}
{"text":"Came here for an early Sunday brunch. Ordered a $14 Steak-and-Eggs (my favorite brunch item). It was good, but nothing exceptional. I did like the variety of items on the plate (eggs, potatoes, a bowl of sliced fruits, and of course the strip of steak)."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches I've had. We went on a Sunday & it wasn't busy at all. There were five of us & we all got something different & everyone's food was great. The biscuits and gravy were amazing. The prices for brunch are extremely reasonable. For under $20, I got the breakfast tacos with potatoes, a side of fruit & a side of pancakes. Each table gets complimentary hot cinnamon rolls too. The food, the service, the atmosphere, and the music they were playing was all excellent. You won't be disappointed. Only issue was they don't have valet for brunch so you have to either valet at blue point, or park at a meter-- there were plenty of open meters when I went."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great. Steak cigars were delicious. Prime rib was fatty and filet was overcooked. However, the manager waived our bill. That was great but disappointing for our first visit. Customer service was better than the food. They were not busy..."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I haven't had a good bite of food there... but I'm giving the Chophouse 3 stars because I really enjoy sitting at their bar and having a beer :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The cornbread is freshly made in a hot skillet. The beef ribs are so tender. It's just amazing."}
{"text":"I had the chop burger, don't order a starter, this dish is very filling! I ate the onion rings toppings like they were an appetizer. This is a very tasty complex burger.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was very helpful at picking a pumpkin ale! I was on my own and felt very comfortable at the bar.  Would go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar & restaurant in Downtown Cleveland, OH. This place is like a \"Cheers\" for me, where everybody knows your name. Excellent steaks and some smattering of seafood entrees. Best known for its microbrews, usually about 6 on tap year-round, with seasonals added regularly. Ice bar is always a conversation starter, there is a 6 inch wide strip of ice lining the black marble bar to rest your drink on. Service always top-notch. You won't be disappointed, give it a try next time you are in town. Tell them the Beer Guy sent you."}
{"text":"Good for the price. I wasn't expecting the best meal of my life but had a nice dinner with some coworkers while I was in town on business.   We had the private room reserved behind the bar which was nice for our size party (9 people). The cabs playoff game was on and the big flatscreen in the room ensured we didn't miss a moment of the big game.  We ordered a bunch of apps. I don't remember them all but the steak cigars were pretty darn good.  Decent cocktail menu. Moscow mules were solid and the old fashions weren't too sweet which i find at many places these days.   Only downside was the first attempt at ordering a steak.  I got the filet oscar. The entire table had been served and mine came out last (which made sense because I ordered rare plus-like any real red blooded AMERICAN.) unfortunately as my serated knife first penetrated this once majestic best, I knew this poor cow had given it's life only to be served to me close to medium.  Not being one to hardly ever send food back (i don't enjoy conflict), i asked for another.  To my enjoyment, the second attempt was superb. I knew the way this beef jiggled on my plate before the waitress even set it down to the table, was spot on.  Service was solid but not memorable.  I might be back after I try a place called XO so many told me about."}
{"text":"So glad this place closed. My husband & I had a horrible dining experience. Our server acted as if we were putting her out the whole evening. We vowed to never return. We would rather spend our $130 at a place that was more interested in customer service, than personal vendettas against their 1st time customers. Sad and ashamed with the economy the way it was in Cleveland. Many could have used her job."}
{"text":"Oh what to do when the service and atmosphere at a restaurant are great but the food not so much? So here's the scoop: went on Saturday night for a late night dinner with some friends that were in town, a party of 6 of us with a reservation, I didn't arrive until well after my other friends since I got caught up at work though. As soon as a sat down, the server was at the table asking if I would like a drink and boy was I ever ready! I ordered my drink and took a look at the menu, while my friends were working their way through the gigantic appetizer sampler they ordered, it looked phenomenal. I was debating between getting 2 appetizers as my meal but settled on the Seafood Cobb sans bacon since the server commented on how she loved it. Let me say, I have never been so disappointed in a salad in my life, looking back I really should have taken a photo of it because it was almost comical that they called this thing a seafood cobb and charged $16 for it. Iceberg lettuce, small chunks of what appeared to be shrimp and random veggies scattered throughout. I know going to a chophouse and ordering a salad is risky but hey, I like to live in the edge, who knows when you'll find a hidden gem in an unexpected place? Everyone else ordered steaks and when they arrived at the table the presentation was great and everyone seemed to enjoy them. I'm not a huge meat eater, hence the salad choice but let me tell you, it had me seriously second guessing my dinner choice. The ambiance was nice, dark and warmly lit, just how I like enjoying dinner and drinks with friends. I may return to give it a proper go around one of these days but there are many other great choices in the area that offer great ambiance, great service and great food!"}
{"text":"In need of dinner, Boyfriend and I take a walk. Cleveland Chop House stands out from the crowd of bars and restaurants in this area as it is not jam-packed and pumping dance music out onto the street. You can actually sit down and carry on a conversation. There are even tablecloths on the \"fancy\" side of the restaurant.   After skimming the menu, I chose the Chop Chop Salad (as it came chock-full of yummy things like dried blueberries, avocado, pumpkin seeds, and more). Boyfriend went with a fillet mignon dinner, medium rare.   Boyfriend's meal came with a house salad, so while he was eating that, I dug into some warm cornbread. I'm obscenely picky when it comes to cornbread (a childhood in the South will do that to you) and I was impressed. Crispy edges, warm, soft middle - cornbread heaven.   My salad arrives... and there are no dried blueberries or pumpkin seeds to be seen. Alas. I'm debating saying something to the server when I pull out a dried blueberry from the bottom of the salad. Ok, so they are there... 4 or 5 of them... at the way bottom. No worries, the salad was still very good, just a touch less exciting than I'd hoped.   Also a touch less exiting was Boyfriend's steak (medium rare, remember?). The steak's preparation was not consistent throughout. Most was medium rare, but part was... oozing cow-tears as it was cut. Mooo!   So, the brewery. My Irish Stout was delicious. Boyfriend's Pilsner was fairly standard. Note, beer-lovers. Get the smaller size if you want to try multiple kinds of beer - the \"tall\" is quite tall, indeed."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner.  Based on the reviews and great looking menu we were looking forward to it.  The bacon wrapped shrimp was amazing.  We split the 16oz strip and it was cooked perfect and they split the meal for us.  As sides we had the mashes potatoes and risotto.   Both were amazing!  They also have a cornbread that comes and it was great too. Our waiter, was friendly and gave recommendations very easily.  For dessert he brought us a brownie & ice cream on the house.  Overall, we had a fantastic time and will definitely be going back if we are in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"It was suggested I come here my first night in Cleveland. By the shuttle driver at my hotel. Well played, Mr. Shuttle Driver Man! I was told that no matter what, I must have the cornbread.  I was given the option to dine at the bar or in the dining room - I was too tired and hungry from my travel day to care - and was led to the dining room. I was served by Karen, who was VERY patient with my lack of decision making abilities. For a drink, I couldn't decide between the Irish Stout and the Doppelbock - Karen brought me samples of each. (I decided on a pint of the Doppelbock with dinner, and a growler of the Stout to bring home as a souvenir.) All entrees come with the cornbread - so I told Karen that I would like EITHER the 12oz prime rib OR the tenderloin tips and mushrooms. She should pick one and surpise me.  She brought the prime rib - and it was a nice medium rare throughout. A little bit more fatty a cut than I would have liked, but the seasonal root veggies on the side were so incredibly amazing that I couldn't help but overlook any shortcomings with the meat.  And Mr. Shuttle Driver Man was right - the invididual iron skillet of fresh cornbread served with honey butter was amazing.  Service - 5 stars Beer - 4 stars Ambience - 4 stars Beef - 3 stars Veggies - 5 stars Cornbread - 5 stars  Overall - 4 stars  See you next time I'm in Cleveland, Chop House! And in case I wasn't clear - SUPER KUDOS to Karen! She is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great find in the downtown area, great happy hour and great food.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cleveland Chop is officially my favorite Happy Hour joint. For Downtown Cleveland, you can't beat these amazing happy hour prices: $3 beers, $4 wines, $5 martinis, and $4-7 apps! The food is always hot and delicious and the drinks are tasty too. The only complaint I would have is that the service can be a bit slow (depending on when you go of course), especially when you want to get as many drinks as you can before happy hour ends, but other than that everything here is wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is good. But very unevetful/creative. And overpriced. It has a nice atmosphere I would think especially in the winter with the dark wood and big comfy booths. But overpriced. We got complimentary cornbread to start with. Ok this was amazing cornbread. best i have ever had. Then i had a side salad and it was just whatevs. I got the Bohemian Pilsner beer that has apparently won awards, It tasted like Bud Light. So then me and the bf got two entrees and did halvsies. The gorgonzola steak was delic. Really spot on medium rare. And some mushrooms and gorgonzola to go w it. The mashed potatoes were pretty dry. The burger was wonderful. perfectly cooked. Fries were average. So all in all good food but nothing new. I just feel like I've eaten that same food before. So if you have some old or young fogies in town in Cleveland and they don't like trying new stuff and want quality food w a very nice atmosphere and service go here."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good for the lack of variety this place exhibited.  I expected to see my favorite cut on the menu, but unfortunately prime rib was nowhere to be seen.  Not to worry, what I did was trade in something old and familiar for something fresh and delicious.  I ordered the center cut porterhouse which was a whopping 24 oz slab of beef slathered in Bourbon butter.  I ordered it medium rare, but it came out a little more red than I wanted it.  This was also true for my friend's cut, so order your cut one step above the way you want it cooked.  Since Chophouse is a part of Rock Bottom Breweries, the beer is excellent.  Their freshly brewed wheat beer was light and refreshing.  You can actually buy their little jug which you can bring back on future visits for cheap ass beer.  If I was going to be in town for a while I definitely would have opted for this.  I came here on a Tuesday and found tons of street parking.  I can't comment on the weekend, but I'd imagine it's packed since this is probably the only place in Cleveland that's happening."}
{"text":"(sign)   My 1/2 glass full attitude was completely shattered.  The other yelpers are right....the CLEVELAND CHOP is just okay.  I mentioned to the waitress that this is the first time YELPING at her restaurant and the there was a deal for 1st time yelpers to get an appetizer for free with the purchase of an entrée.  The waitress had no clue to what I was referring.  She didn't even know what YELP was(.... how can you be in the service industry and not know who YELP is? )  She did say she could call a manager to find out what I mean....too much of a hassle.   The food did come out in a timely manner.  However, my meat was not cooked correctly (thank gosh it was tender cut).   I have never used a salt & pepper shaker as much as I did for ANY meal(I was not alone on that one either, a few other folks had to do the same).  Yikes!  My co-dinner, thought the prime rib dinner special for $20 was a good deal and would return for this prime rib Saturday Night Special.  To be honest, it was the few dishes that was even \"plated\" prettily.     On the positive side:  - the cocktail menu is creative, especially the \"mules\" , served in a copper mug  - it is a great space, in a great part of downtown  - the cornbread smothered in a whipped, sweetened butter was a hit   - the roasted brussel sprouts were well liked  Service was average, when our waitress was around.   We had to go hunting for her for drinks, for our check and to get the credit cards settled.  She was nice enough  but I am not there to be her friend.  I would return for a drink but a lot must change for me to want to eat there again.  Maybe this is just meant to be a happy hour joint."}
{"text":"The Setting:   It was a chilly Sunday morning in March. The sun is shining and Cleveland is bustling with the after-church and Sunday-Market day crowds. A friend of mine invites me to brunch with her at the Chophouse. About $25 for all you can eat brunch buffet, carving station, waffle station, and dessert table.   The Spread:   Wow! They had everything from cold salads and smoked salmon to mussels di napoli, sausage-gravy with biscuits, and fried chicken and ribs The carving station was serving up roast beef, turkey and ham all with Au jus and horseradish sauce. Belgian waffles were made to order. And the dessert table was stacked with an inviting array of mini-cakes, pastries, and chocolate mousse.   My friend and I also took the liberty of ordering omelettes ($6) and a make-your-own Bloody Mary bar ($8). The Bloody Mary fixins' were spot on with everything from sour and bitter to tangy and spicy. Although -- no Sriracha (which if you're reading this, Chophouse, add Sriracha to the bar)   I digress... the Sunday brunch buffet is highly recommended. It can get busy but they have plenty of space for everyone and the buffet is too large too ever get crowded. Service is extremely nice and helpful. The people on Sundays are generally really nice and polite. My only negative is that there are too many rude kids running around... but I can hardly blame them... Its Cleveland after-all."}
{"text":"Visiting friends in Cleveland led us to many fine drinking and eating establishments. This one was mediocre. Staff very friendly but not attentive enough. Don't order the caprese salad. Their version of half ripe tomatoes, too little basil and too much balsamic glaze (I think everybody is using this glaze on overboard mode) didn't come close to what it should be. The complimentary corn bread was a nice touch but way too sweet with the honey butter (my companions told me this as I resist these items). Our strip steaks and filet were very good and the sides worked. The crispy brussel sprouts were delicious but begged for tums later on. Our Manhattans were fair but I am a self proclaimed conissuer. Will not be returning to this restaurant and it's probably off the list for the locals too"}
{"text":"Chop House is lucky that I waited until my second time there to try it out. That's right, Lucky I say! The fact is the first time I went I ordered a salad. Not something I would usually do, but the girl that was treating me to lunch said they were amaaahhhzing. Yes, it was Penny from \"Happy Endings\".   Anyway, the salad was an enormous bowl of green with a couple of pieces of chicken on it. There was no dressing. Literally, i had to ask for dressing. And in general it was a total waste.   However, my second trip was Amaaahhhhzing. I ordered the lobster club and it was delish. Huge chunks of lobster and very tender. The bacon was also NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM. And there was a great citrus aioli. I ate every last scrap on my plate.   Note: It is not a delicate thing to eat. Ladies: DO NOT go on a first date and order this. I mean, you can. But only if you don't think you really like the guy."}
{"text":"I have recently been here 3 times in the last month and I have nothing but good things to say.  I was never here when it was Chophouse so I have nothing to compare it to, but I have had nothing but great experiences as the new one.    The first time I came, was for dinner with some friends, our waitress was excellent! She recommended the perfect appetizer for all of us to split, then when I ordered wine she kindly suggested another brand as she was not the biggest fan of the one I ordered.  Which some people may take that the wrong way but I greatly appreciated it! I did not want to have to forcefully finish a bad glass of wine.    We split the Spinach Cheese Dip with homemade pita chips on the side which are to die for.  The actually gave you too many chips for the dip when usually the problem was the other way around.    On this trip I had the Asian salad and it was delicious and very large! I would definitely order it again - my friends had been there before and got the burger and a seafood pasta and both looked out of this world and heard no complaints for them.  All in all a great experience, with good food and a great staff.   But... the REAL reason why I gave it 5 stars is its Happy Hour!!!! One of the best happy hours downtown in my opinion.  Every draft is only $3 - and that may not seem like a great deal but all of their drafts are high end craft beers, which you cannot find for $3 anywhere.  Then they have $4 Martinis and $5 specialty cocktails including a very tasty Moscow Mule.    They also have Happy Hour food deals with 6 different pizzas, crab cake, sliders, calamari, ahi tacos, chicken fingers, and a few other things and the prices for all of them are between $5-$7.  I get their ahi polk tacos every time because they are so good I can't not get something else, but my friends LOVE their loaded chicken fingers and black and bleu pizza.    If you are looking for an after work spot Cleveland Chop is the place to stop.  You can get a filling meal and cheap drinks, but if you want something nicer their dining room is stellar."}
{"text":"I had a delicious prime rib (so tender and perfectly cooked)  with crispy brussel sprouts ( roasted but a little too salty/burnt) and mashed potatoes (good but nothing out of the ordinary) . My husband had the filet Oscar (excellent). And my in laws had the bacon wrapped shrimp ( a must try!!) sweet potato fries (comes with a spicy chinese mustard- a very interesting pairing) and the Cobb salad (huge! portion). Cornbread comes first and it had bits of jalapeños which I loved.  We had a great time. not busy at all on a Sunday night. Would like to go back and try more of the appetizers and non steak dishes!"}
{"text":"We went to Cleveland for NBA finals. We had reservations there and we were pleased from minute we walked in. Excellent service and food was delicious. Waitress was so knowledgeable and helpful. Their cornbread before your food was out of this world!! We are from Fort Texas.....the land of great steaks and would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The only reason I've given this place three instead of four stars is value for the money.  Service was very good--both the hostess and waitress were very attentive.  I had a straightforward meal--salad, steak with baked potato, and a glass of wine.  The Caesar salad was forgettable (they had a $1 charge if you wanted anchovies that I didn't opt for).  The ribeye steak was cooked perfectly but definitely didn't warrant $42.  The baked potato wasn't completely cooked through and while they immediately hopped on that and brought a replacement, it was cooked the same way.  After tip, the meal set me back $70.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner after a show downtown....Dori our server made our stop a special and enjoyable experience - offering to take our family photo, providing excellent menu recommendations, and remaining attentive but not intrusive.  We will be back for the excellent steaks, generous portions and will be sure to ask for Dori!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday expecting the brunch buffet but they don't  have the brunch buffet anymore we were somewhat disappointed so we order off  the brunch menu and it was still very good."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday night around 9:15 and it was almost empty!  Granted it was freezing and slushy raining, but for its location, I was surprised when we walked in.  I have never been to Cleveland before and we wanted to go somewhere with good bar food and drinks before we went out for the night and we found exactly that at Cleveland Chop.  Actually, they had GREAT bar food.  Highly recommend the fried oysters.  We ordered a burger and sweet potato fries and I had the crab cake appetizer with a cup of the crab bisque for my dinner.  Everything was amazing.  The soup was thick and creamy and cheesy and filled with crabmeat and the crab cake was the perfect amount of seasoning and mayonnaise goodness to not totally over-stuff me before we went out on the town.  Boy said burger was cooked to perfection and the sweet potato fries were really good too.  The only thing I wasn't a fan on was their ranch! too sweet. and I was sad because I LOVE RANCH. anyway. everything else was great. our server was excellent and our drinks were good and stayed full.  Wouldn't mind going back next time we are in town:)"}
{"text":"This was a solid 4.5 stars.  I had not been to the restaurant since the change from the Chophouse.   I stopped here on a Monday evening for Happy Hour and left happy and full!   The bartender was super nice and very attentive without being overbearing.  I ordered a cocktail which was placed in iced tray that runs the length of the bar (nice touch) and I proceeded to order the calamari and a wedge salad.   The wedge salad was fresh and well-prepared, but just a little bit different than I'm used to.   Classic iceberg wedge of lettuce, with red onion, yellow heirloom tomatoes and just a few pieces of bacon.  The entire salad was drizzled with bleu cheese crumbles and dressing.   There was a deviled jalapeno egg on the side.   The calamari arrived shortly thereafter(huge portion).   Small, tender rings dredged in a crispy bread which included black sesame seeds.  The calamari was lightly covered in a wasabi cream sauce with an apricot glaze on the side for dipping.   This was a great combination, crunch, spicy and sweet!    There was also an individual serving of jalapeno corn bread served in a cast iron skillet.  The corn bread was dense, sweet and flavortul.   All in all this was a great Happy Hour meal.   I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"We dined in for New Years and the food was delicious! The ambiance is nice and our server was amazing.. wish the valet guys were a lil nice (one let the door slam on me while I was walking in) but other then that, perfect downtown restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a good steak. More casual than some other steakhouses, but that comes with the brewery part of the name. I tried their pumpkin beer and an irish style stout. Both were spot on. Great beer, good food and an enjoyable atmosphere. Service can be a little slow at times, but friendly and offers good suggestions."}
{"text":"After receiving several recommendations, I finally went to the Cleveland Chophouse for dinner. I wish I had gone sooner. I had the Gorgonzola fillet and a baked potato. The meal was perfect. Additionally the service was excellent. My waitress Jen was very friendly and extremely helpful. the next time I am in Cleveland, I will defiantly make it back to the Chophouse!"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I were in Cleveland for a conference and on the last night decided to splurge a little.  It was a Wednesday night so the restaurant was rather empty.  Everything was fantastic! Our waitress was awesome and didn't blink an eye when all ten of us asked for separate checks.  She was prompt and friendly with everything.  The food was also fantastic. I had the crab cakes with white cheddar mashed potatoes. It was delicious.  They also brought out a skillet of jalapeño corn bread which was a welcome and yummy surprise.  For dessert a group of us split the salted caramel ice cream sandwich. It was to die for!!!!! I would definitely recommend a stop here!"}
{"text":"This location in downtown Cleveland is located near many other restaurants. It was recommend by a friend of mine so I gave it a shot. The seating is a bit cramped.   The first thing I tried on the menu was a bacon wrapped shrimp starter. They managed to put a tiny piece of blue cheese in the center of the shrimp before they wrapped it with a small piece of bacon. The blue cheese really added a twist to the flavor combination. The only downside was that there were only five of them.  Just prior to the main course they brought out a small frying pan of corn bread with a small ice cream scoop of butter on it. The corn bread had some whole kernels of corn in it, which added to the texture, but the size of the additional dish was more well suited for a larger party.  For the main course I ordered the fillet oscar with a side of Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were rite and buttery but slightly over cooked on the outside. The fillet oscar was ordered to be medium, but was cooked much closer to medium rare. The crab topping was very good but had far too much sauce in it. Overall the fillet and meal were very good."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but the food was terrible! Thank god for the beer. I would recommend going somewhere else if you are looking for, what most would call, decent food.  Over priced and tasteless food.  The only saving grace were the Microbrews. The service was great, but the food was over priced for the portion and quality that was served to me. I ordered the fried calamari, it was soggy and more breading than squid. i would not recommend going here."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of Cleveland chop and I have been for years. I have always told people they have the the best happy hour in Cleveland, despite great restaurants like XO and Bluepoint being close by...well now it's changed to \"had\"...I'm not sure if they have a new chef or not but the menu is constantly changing and now the food is very lack luster. I ordered a pizza tonight that was nothing better than a personal pan from pizza HUT...my friends food was cold and the crab cake was about the size of a silver dollar. I think I'll begin going to pier w...it's sad"}
{"text":"Well after seeing the wonderful Paulius's thoughts I just couldn't resist but put mine out there.  Meh If I'm going to spend that kind of money I'm going um. . . anywhere else.  After growing up in a traditional slovak home and never having had a rare steak until moving out on my own. . . I'm a little more than picky when it comes to a big slab o beef placed in front of me. Especially when I'm paying as much as I would be at the Fig for the duck.  Upon moving to Cleveland I heard rave reviews from people. Now I do understand most people are not as food snobbish as I, but when 10-12 people say something about a place. . .not applebees you can usually guess it will at least be palatable. Not so much with the chophouse.   In the times I have been to the chophouse I have ordered a T bone (I most certainly was not paying for that meal. It was a wine and dine by a biotech co) and a steak salad (Honestly how bad can you really screw up a salad?) and a few other times just for beer.   The beer is usually the highlight of the visit. The service is usually lousy so you'll be waiting til your stout reaches room temp but there's nothing wrong with a stout served at proper temp.   The T bone I had was cooked to oblivion when I ordered medium. It was a waste of a. . .honestly not even decent cut of meat. It was chewy, DRY, fatty fatty fatty which is interesting when the meat itself is bone dry.  I was so turned off I could barely look at the mashed potatoes with any thought other than just what I need now more dry food.   The salad would have made any decent veggie vendor at the west side market go into convulsions at seeing the horror. The poor salad greens were left sitting in dressing probably since sometime around morning prep. The meat was chewy. Most certainly not the skirt steak it was supposed to be. And again cooked to oblivion. Honestly can you not figure out how to not kill a cow all over again by butchering the goodness of the meat.   Not to miss: The handcrafted stouts are quite yummy  Hit or Miss: waiter? waiter? hello? can I get my beer?  Avoid like the plague: The steak oh the humanity the steak don't even think about it. Get up do not pass go do not collect $200 and head straight to Morton's or Lola you'll feel much better about spending the money TRUST ME."}
{"text":"i recently dined here with my girlfriend.  now, i did not frequent this place when it was known as the \"chophouse\" so this is a review based upon my experience.  we were seated promptly and they have a cornbread dish instead of bread that is brought out.  im not exactly a fan of cornbread but this was quite tasty.  the starter ceaser salad was more palatable of lettuce than the dressing.  ive had better ones.  wine list was pretty good.  our entreés consisted of the 12 oz ny strip steak along with a rice/veggie pilaf and some sort of chicken dish with mashed potatoes.  i requested the steak medium well and it tasted well done...very chewy and burnt in some spots.  the chicken was very good from the few bites i had.  i will add that this was during \"cleveland restaurant week\" so i expected it to be busy but it was a pretty nice environment and very laidback.  everyone who helped us was generally pleasant.  i was slightly miffed about my steak, as well as the place running out of menu items, but overall i did enjoy myself and will be back."}
{"text":"Very impressed with my visit here. Good atmosphere, not too bright but not all cave-like either. Decently priced, but apps and drinks can push the bill quite a bit.  Service was good, fairly attentive.  I'm a big fan of the menu, good variety but still small enough to concentrate on doing the dishes well. I like the fish offerings and look forward to trying more.  The soup du jour was fantastic in flavor. The asparagus was firm and both cooked and seasoned very well.  I also had the Colorado Trout...cooked well, very flavorful, good portion.  I was not able to sample the brews this time as I was working, but I look forward to doing so next time."}
{"text":"after eating at sushi rock (a block away) my friend and i wanted to bar hop a little. after walking around the block and checking out the scene, we decided on the cleveland chop house and brewery. we thought \"this place reminds me of rock bottom in downtown long beach\" and as i search for this yelp review im surprised to find out that this place is actually part of them! hahah  anyway, we sat in the bar which had a live band playing good jazz music. it was nice but SUPER loud since it was right there in the bar. so loud its hard to hear anybody whos not up in your face.   anyway, i ordered their \"seasonal wheat beer\" which our waiter said is like blue moon. im not sure if it actually was blue moon but it was pretty good. my friend ordered a red wine and said it was pretty good as well.   they have outdoor seating, where you cant really hear the live music from the inside, which i thought was good since the music isnt blaring as you walk by on the sidewalk.  i havent been to rock bottom out here in cali but want to try it out =)"}
{"text":"I'm literally shocked to see the number of low ratings for this place because we had such an outstanding experience.    We came here upon the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel on a Sunday afternoon when he heard we were looking for a good burger for lunch.  This place has such cool decor and atmosphere- like a high end steakhouse but more relaxed.  We were greeted immediately by our server (Amanda I think?) who was able to answer our questions about the beer menu right away and got our drinks quickly.    We checked in on Yelp and saw that they have a Yelp deal for a free app.  We also had a coupon that the concierge gave us, and the manager on duty, Margaret, explained that we couldn't use both, but ended up bringing us some AMAZING cinnamon rolls anyway which went a long way with us!  She also hung around and we had a nice conversation with her, and she told us a little bit about the history of the place which was really cool- and showed how much the ownership and management care about this restaurant!  We ordered their burger to share that came with a Bacon Gruyere compote which was to DIE for.  They also split the burger on to two plates for us which was nice.  We ordered the fries which comes with a honey glaze of some kind- the flavor was not overpowering and just perfect- they were delicious.  The burger was also cooked perfectly- and one of the better burgers I have had in awhile.    Our service was excellent, the food was outstanding and we will most certainly return next time we are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Brunch here is very good, dinner was a little disappointing. The atmosphere is really cute and kind of fancy. The staff are nice. When you order brunch you get little cinnamon rolls which are nothing special but good and fun.  Dinner is expensive and overall not really worth it. My boyfriend ordered beef roast and garlic mashed potatoes which were really good. I ordered the appetizer tuna tacos and a salad. The tacos were bland, and the salad was too sweet with gross cheese. It just seemed really expensive for dinner."}
{"text":"This was our first and last visit to Cleveland Chop.  The waitress seemed to be in such a hurry and kept rushing us for our order.  We got their famous steak cigars as an appetizer and they were very greasy.  My husband's petite fillet was very good and so was the brussel sprouts.  I ordered the seafood bouillabaisse with risotto (the special that night).  The tuna in the dish was way, way over cooked and smelled (unpleasantly) fishy.  The waitress was kind enough to take it off our bill.  Very over priced for what you get.  There are much better steak places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Cleveland Chophouse & Brewery is like one of those movie previews that got you all excited, but when you see the actual movie, you're left thoroughly disappointed and utterly ripped off of your hard-earned $9.25.  I was pretty excited, after 3 nights of eating room service food, to finally have a proper food in a restaurant that is supposed to be more than decent.  And what's not to love about the place - the dark wood-paneled interior, the servers in crisp white shirts, the interesting posters on the wall, ad infinitum.  So we ordered the sampler appetizer.  Huge, two-tiered platter of chicken tenders, breaded calamari, portobello mushrooms, and prawn cocktails.  Quantity, yes.  Quality, uhm....  Then out came the special for the day, bone-in steak with blue cheese crust, cooked medium rare with mashed potatoes.  The steak was the toughest piece of beast I've ever had, semi cold and a bit too rare for my liking (and I'm the type that likes my steak bloody).    The mash was strangely hard - not sure how that is possible.  I don't cook and my version of mashed potatoes is out of a box and into a pot of boiling water and it still tasted better.  The saving grace was the warm apple pie with vanilla bean ice cream.  But then again, the Hyatt's warm apple cobbler (also with vanilla bean ice cream - must be a Cleveland thing), was just as good if not better."}
{"text":"Went on a few nights ago and sat at the bar.  I was not acknowledged for 20+ minutes by the two people working behind the bar (hard to call them barTENDERS when they are not tending bar). I was finally acknowledged and told \"I'll be right with you\" to which I waited another 10 minutes before I got up and left.   I've been here before.  The food was pretty good, the drinks were okay.    This experience though... I'll never be back."}
{"text":"I. Love. Cleveland Chop.  This place always wins for me. I love the warm cornbread with a little spicy kick, the house cocktails and varying Mules, crispy fries, and don't even get me started on the steak salad. Okay so this salad!.!.. I'm always so full from apps, cornbread and good drinks that this salad is perfect every time. I get to taste the delicious savory steak and also get the fresh flavors from the salad veggies (and big bites of blue cheese). I get it every time I come here, leaving happy and taking plenty home for lunch the next day.   Did you know they have a back patio here? Super private and cute, like you're sitting on someone's family deck (but in the middle of an old courtyard in Cleveland). Don't look down at the abandoned office furniture and just enjoy the quiet ambiance.   Brunch is killer here too - free cinnamon rolls!! Service is always attentive, kind and professional. Business lunch, birthday dinner, date night or brunch - go here.mm"}
{"text":"Went here after the Browns game on Sunday. Sat at the bar. Got calamari. Really good. Got a burger and sweet potato fries. Both good. Nothing outstanding, Just good solid food.  Yeah, I know it's a steak place but we just wanted some quick food before heading home. And surprisingly, this place worked just fine.  The bartender was friendly and we had a TV in front of us with a game on it."}
{"text":"I had the salmon, which was cooked perfectly. The spinach cheese dip appetizer was great as well. For dessert, I had the salted caramel brownie - also wonderful. Overall, great food here."}
{"text":"Terrible service and they ran out of everything on the menu. We showed up with a party of 20 on a Saturday... The restaurant was empty. They ran out of salmon, didn't give me a choice on my side and our steaks were not cooked the way we asked them to be. I would not recommend coming here. The one star I did give them was for the wine.. Because it's the only thing that got me through waiting the hour and 1/2 for my cold food."}
{"text":"I recently visited Cleveland on a business trip--haven't been since I was a little kid heading to Municipal Field for an Indians game with my dad. And from what I recall, downtown Cleveland hasn't changed much. STILL TERRIFYING. I live in Chicago proper and I'll walk downtown with little trepidation. Cleveland at midday is a ghost town. Cleveland at night is even more disturbing. The city has SO much going for it (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Tower City, the Flats, etc.), but it has clearly been hit by the economy.   Rant about Cleveland over. :) Cleveland Chop House was a pleasant meat-fest type of place. All diners are served cornbread in a mini-skillet with a side of honey butter--delicious. Their drinks are poured generously and their meat portions probably contribute a great deal to the nation's obesity rate.   All this said--if you're in the city for business and you have the option of going anywhere, I'd steer you away from this location and towards the Nauti Mermaid or Blue Point Grille."}
{"text":"Good spot for happy hour in the summer. Moscow Mules for days. Good appetizers as well."}
{"text":"This was a to go order.  I ordered the steak cobb salad and calamari. Salad was ok, but they forgot the dressing, steak was tender and flavorful. Calamari was ok, a little too much breading. My coworker ordered the crab cake and bread pudding. He did not care for either of them."}
{"text":"Incredible establishment. Brought my parents here for dinner and they loved it. Our server Ryan was very attentive and polite. All of our food was brought out quickly. We had a calamari appetizer that was to die for. We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time at the  Chop House. The interior is beautiful and has the old school tile and molding appeal. The service was fast and thorough and my filet was cooked perfectly. You do receive alot of food here so come hungry or order wisely. I will definitely be back during another visit to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Not good at all. 6oz steaks are really about 3 - 3.5 ounces at best. Over cooked filets ; of 4 steaks all were literally burnt on outside. Not seared, crusted and burnt.  Visual appearance of each 7 dishes was lack lustre. Save your money and bypass this over-rated so called steakhouse."}
{"text":"We had read all the great reviews here before selecting Cleveland Chop as our dinner destination on Valentine's Day. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. My boyfriend had made reservations far in advance which they misplaced. Once seated, we waited almost an hour for a glass of water. When we inquired about some selections on the wine list our waitress could make no recommendations. Those seated around us were constantly waiting for the waitress to reappear & one couple had to send their food back. The waitress bumped into me at least three times during the course of the evening & the food was just OK. Then, at the end of our dinner I actually had to ask for the dessert menu. All & all just a huge disappointment. What was even more amusing is we sent a letter regarding our horrible guest experience & the management team emailed us back & expected US to call THEM! We didn't even bother. In my opinion save your money & skip the Chop. If you want an incredible dining experience head down the street to Blue Point. They won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I had a good experience here. The service was great. The shrimp cocktail was good and the NY Strip was nice. Overall I would go back."}
{"text":"This isn't a place I'd go for dinner, but you can not beat their happy hour. They have great happy hour food prices ($3 off appetizers), but the beer is what keeps me going back over and over on an early Friday evening.  It's $3 for a 22oz. beer.  $3? Yes, I said $3.  They have some great House Brew options.    It is a great drink deal, so the place does fill up.  If you're meeting friends, send one early to snag a table."}
{"text":"I love going to Cleveland chop! They have such a variety of food! They have an amazing brunch as well! They have happy hour deals that are well worth it. The place is great and it so large that I've never had to wait to be seated. They also have a nice patio for the warmer months."}
{"text":"The name suggests a steakhouse, but I'm not a steak guy.  Let's just put that out there.  Therefore the menu was a little limited for me.  Started out with the calamari which is really bland.  You need to drench that calamari in lemon or something, because it tastes like nothing.  Ended up going with a chicken caesar salad.  Which was surprisingly good.  But my friends thought their food was just okay.  So I'd say it's not worth a return trip."}
{"text":"I went here for a Dishcrawl event and I was very pleasantly surprised! The interior was nice, but the main point of this review is to talk about the food!! They served us a sampling of their tenderloin tips and the chicken piccata with a huge pile of mashed potatoes and some fried straws. The sauce on the tenderloin tips had this sweet delicious taste to it and the caperberry paired very well with the chicken. Both were excellent and I would definitely go back! I'm actually salivating right now thinking about the food mmm.  Others at our table got a margarita that came with it's own pitcher, so for $9 you got almost 2 1/2 drinks!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. Four of us ate there last night. App's were great, everyone loved their meals and service was excellent.  I'll definitely eat here again next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant online when a friend was in town and wanted seafood. He ended up getting chicken and I got the most amazing crab covered salmon with risotto. I am still telling people about it and I went weeks ago!   The atmosphere was great-very classy and homey. The service was excellent. The price was about was you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber-about $20 a plate. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Decent.  Good decor for a chop house, I got the Steak Chop Salad and it was basically flavorless.  The brussels sprouts were good though.  Our service was excellent which completely saved the lunch.  I would go back, but possibly try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place my son who is 9, loves the steaks, we usually get the filet mignon executive cut. The steak doesn't need a knife it is so tender and juicy. I love this restaurant. The service is exceptional. My family likes to try different restaurant's and we are steak connoisseurs and this place is a great value and so reasonable!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why but I thought the beer selection was a little weak - and they didn't sell pints so I couldn't add to my collection!  The Irish Red was pretty tasty though.  Nothing stood out about it, pretty standard.  My meal was amazing.  First of all, the fresh baked cornbread is to die for.  Crumbly and sweet on top.  Mmm...  I had the Gorgonzola fillet medallions.  One medallion was plenty, considering the amount of Gorgonzola on it - but anything with that kind of cheese and I MUST order it.  To substitute broccoli for carbs was a $5 charge.  That's a little ridiculous I think, especially since I didn't even get the sauce on it.    Overall, great bar atmosphere, awesome flavors, and decent service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. They're brunch, lunch, happy hour and dinner are all very good! They have a decent size brunch menu with a variety of options. My favorite may be the crab omelet. They also offer carafes of mimosas which are a little over 2 drinks so a pretty good deal. I've come here with friends in tshirts and sweats for brunch and we don't feel underdressed here. The lunch menu offers a ton of options as well- sandwiches, salads, soups, tacos. It's always hard to choose. The happy hour specials are great deals. My favorite item is the pizzas. Even though this is a steakhouse this isn't a super fancy place. It's also not too expensive. The Warehouse District has a lot of expensive restaurant so nice to have a reasonable place."}
{"text":"Oh, Chop...how the mighty have fallen. Returned for another Restaurant Week experience and left with a bad taste in my mouth (and not just from the sunblock-flavored cheesecake.)  We were told reservations were running 15 min behind when we got there a little before 8:30, which is no big deal. But to be seated 45 min after your reservation - during which time the hostess gives away the table she tells you is ready - is a little frustrating.   While waiting, we decided to have a beer at the bar, which needs some major help. One bartender makes all the drinks for the tables, while the other does god knows what. Had to track someone down after 10 min of sitting there without ordering (only about 12 people at the bar, total), and again when it took 10 min to cash out after we got the bill. When we finally got to our table, we also learned that the bar is very light-handed, as the $9 Crazy Burro (tequila - lime - ginger beer) came out as 100% watered down ginger beer and zero tequila.  That one got sent back, a personal first.   The only saving grace of the night was our server, who was genuinely friendly, and the gouda stuffed chicken, which neither of us could resist. Overall, restaurant week menu could use a little more variety, especially when it comes to the one dessert choice of the aforementioned Coppertone cheesecake, which was served warm (no thank you).   Have had a few positive experiences at Chop in the past for both dinner and happy hour, but this one will keep me from returning for a while. Unfortunately (for them), there are literally hundreds of other places in Cleveland to spend $100 on a dinner for 2 that offer better food and much better service."}
{"text":"This review deals specifically with their happy hour, which I definitely recommend. From 4-7 on weekdays they have great deals on appetizers and drinks. You can get three dollar wines along with other drink deals, and the appetizers are all pretty sizeable and delicious for under $10. The atmosphere in the bar area is your classic upscale bar, with dark wood accents. I love the ice shelf they have built into the bar for your drinks; it adds a nice touch. This is definitely one of my favorite happy hours to go to when looking for something relaxed and it is a great bargain for a quality experience."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after getting in at the Cleveland airport.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't have any beer (at a brewery?  blasphemy!) but the food selection was pretty amazing.  I had a hard time narrowing it down but ended up getting salmon with some citrus sauce and a baked potato and it was amazing.  Downside is that another guest had ordered a side he didn't love so the waitress offered another side (perk!) and he settled on the mashed potatoes.  First, they brought about four sides of mashed potatoes on a side plate (nice, I guess) but the potatoes were so, so, so salty.  I don't think I am too picky especially when it comes to what I ordered myself but this was crazy.  I wouldn't be opposed to going back but rarely go out to eat in Cleveland so..."}
{"text":"Yes! Bartenders are to notch. Steak tacos are on point. Moscow mules are succulent. Try the fried oysters."}
{"text":"An upscale place that creates a 1920s vibe. Great cornbread to start and our meals were good, but not great. It's a place to try."}
{"text":"Service was extremely bad on the patio. Moscow Mules were served in glasses instead of the standard copper mugs. Ordered a burger from the menu which said a side of choice was included. When we got the bill, an upcharge for the side was added. Manager explained that, although the menu didn't mention the upcharge, the waitress should have told us. He said he would take the charge off, but never came back."}
{"text":"Solid food and excellent service. I had a burger and fries for lunch. My friend had a chicken sandwich, which he said was excellent,"}
{"text":"Two words: food poisoning. I will never go back here again."}
{"text":"We needed a convenient brunch spot in downtown Cleveland for a post wedding Sunday brunch for 80 people and I would recommend Cleveland Chop  to anyone looking for delicious food, top-notch staff and a welcoming environment. Margaret planned our event from start to finish and she was extremely caring for the elderly folks in our group, making them feel comfortable, welcome and well taken care of.  Margaret was there on the day of the event and made sure that everything ran smoothly. (Sometimes you plan an event with a planner and then because it's a weekend, the planner is not in attendance to deal with any problems.) Margaret was wonderful and she gave us various menu options and suggestions. The layout of the back room and their buffet set up was easy for people to navigate and the Bloody Mary bar was Instagram worthy.  David stepped in and helped with the technology, as we had a wedding video we wanted to play. We felt well taken care of and the guests from age 3 - 75 were delighted with the quality of the food, service and overall event. Thank you Cleveland Chop House!"}
{"text":"Very impressed... definitely a place for quality steaks! Highly recommend the chop margarita...AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Cleveland Chop was on their opening night and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Our second time around was not bad, but my review was teetering between 3 and 4 stars due to the slow kitchen/bar service this time (and the fact that the bar got the drink wrong after 15 minutes of waiting for it). Our waiter was awesome (his name was Sean) and he continuously checked in to either give us updates or see if we needed anything and also made us aware of the happy hour they have every day but Saturday (noted!). I highly recommend the delectable Steak Cigars as an appetizer (and thanks to a check-in on yelp, these were free!). I got the Filet Oscar (med-rare), which was pretty  good but it was a little tough to cut through. My date got the catch of the day, the herb-crusted sea bass, which he said was good, even though it was steakier versus flakier. I also opted for the healthier side of crispy brussel sprouts, and they were buttery, crispy and filling (I use the term 'healthy' loosely when I go out). All in all, it seemed to be an off day with the cooks, so I'll let it slide and be trying this place out again sometime soon (probably happy hour!)."}
{"text":"Chophouse has good steaks, but lunch has become unbearable there.  The new menu has higher prices and FAR less food.    One of their staple lunch dishes, tenderloin tips, has been reduced to four bits of tenderloin and a wedge salad, for $15!!  My office has blacklisted Chophouse for lunch."}
{"text":"Maybe it is a mortal sin to go to a steakhouse and order fish but nevertheless I expected more from $17 trout. In Russia we have a saying : whenever the food is oversalted the cook must be in love. Well the chef of this steakhouse must be head over heels. My trout tasted as if it was caught in the Dead Sea -so salty my eyelids swelled up.  The highlight of my meal was the warm corn bread. The highlight of my date on the other side was the spoonful of calamari  strategically landing in my cleavage (oops).  Decent malbec, polite service. But not worth it in general. Blah."}
{"text":"Ok, I know a good meal from a great one and I know a mediocre one from a horrible one but I can't really classify this one.   Stellar server. Hands down quick, knowledgeable and clearly one who knows the trade. But servers aren't responsible for the food.   The beer sampler is awesome. I'd go for just the beer they have.   I know I'm a food snob, but I  know what good food is.  The jumbo lump crab cakes were almost as bad as the ones I got at Ruby Tuesday. Dry. My cow was good but how hard it it to screw up a decent cut of meat.   My rice seemed to be missing an ingredient listed on the menu and it didn't look very presentable. Garnishing even with chopped Parsley does more than you think. My wifes mashed potatoes weren't  very hot, but that could be just because it sat in the window on a cold plate, who knows what happened.     I'd go back for a lunch, a beer (or two), but not my idea of white tablecloth fine dinning."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. My husband and I went for Father's Day and he enjoyed. He had the chicken and waffles and I had the hangover burger. Both were awesome. I can't wait to try more items. Might go again for my birthday in October. Beautiful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went tonite for a date with my husband. Reservations easy. Cool decor. Service slow. Arrived early to enjoy great Happy Hour prices. Had a cab wine was pretty good.  Bar was crowded but a group was leaving and gave us their table.  Sitting for 30 minutes we hadn't had a server to clear the table or pick up the previous guest bill. Wanted to order apps, server ignored us.   Went to our table. Nice server again but SLOW. French onion soup extremely hot!!! Our entrees came out my petite filet ordered medium...came out well done for a 6 0z filet it looked to be the 3 0z. my husband 8 oz filet cooked perfectly. i had to wait for a redo. Ate alone as my husband was finished when my second steak arrived.   It was cooked medium rare and delicious but I lost my appetite waiting. Brussel sprouts were burnt and dried. Quite dissapointing for the price 120.00 plus tip and poor service as it was early in the evening and not very busy. We will not be back. I am not a picky ester but at these prices I expected better"}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse that is great if you have kids. Hey have a $5 kids menu (FYI there is no steak on the menu) along with high end premium cuts of steaks that are both wet and dry aged. I enjoyed the food and service. I also appreciated being able to have a really nice meal alongside my 11month old and 9 year old. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"A pretty good lunch option in downtown.  The burger was flavorful and juicy.  It was actually cooked medium, as ordered.  Fries, service and ambiance were all adequate for a lunch.  Fairly priced."}
{"text":"Came here with some coworker after our training in Cleveland. Since we were able to get reimburse for our meals we decided to go treat ourselves to some nice steaks. We started with some drinks. I ordered the 22oz American pale ale- which was pretty good. Thought it was cool that they had a brewery in there. For my meal I ordered the Gorgonzola Filet and had mashed potatoes as my side. The entree came with a salad (ceasar or house) and fresh warm cornbread for the table! For me, the best part of the meal was the cornbread and honey butter. My steak was decent but it wasn't mindblowing or anything like that.  The waitress recommended the mashed potatoes which tasted like cheddar or some type of cheese was added to it. It was a bit too salty for my taste. My bill came out to $45 which included 18% gratuity."}
{"text":"Been here once while it was Chophouse, twice as the Chop.  Never awful, never great.  Most recently went there for Downtown Cleveland Restaurant Week.  The Market Salad was okay, but was nothing as it was described.  The salad was supposed to have pears in it, and I had not a single pair.  One of my friends at the table had one thin slice of a pear in hers.  The NY strip steak that I ordered medium was more medium-well to even well.  It had a lot of gristle and fat.  The meat was difficult at times to even cut with the steak knife.  The asparagus risotto was delicious.  I ordered the Espresso Crème Brulee and it was eh.  Not awful, but nothing I'd be craving in the future.  The ambiance is very nice and has that steakhouse feel to it.  Our waitress was very nice and catered to us very nicely."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not bad, but it has some areas for improvement.  The beer is palatable and, as some other reviewers have noted, their happy hour specials are downright impressive.  The dinner prices exceed the quality of the entrees, however, and the service can sometimes be spotty.  If Chophouse worked just a little harder on staffing and management (both kitchen and front of the house), I think it could easily reach the next level."}
{"text":"Just left brunch. If it is indicative of their dinner menu, STAY HOME! One of the worst quality brunches in Cleveland and have had them all. Also the group has never been charged for coffee with a buffet brunch. Drinks were good."}
{"text":"Came here today for Sunday brunch and was not impressed. I ordered the lobster and asparagus omelette with hollandaise and received what was really an asparagus omelette with less than half an ounce of lobster meat sprinkled on top like a garnish and flooded with hollandaise. The food was not particularly flavorful or tasty and sadly I left feeling that the brunch was something I could get at Denny's for a more reasonable price. Will not be returning for brunch. In all fairness perhaps if I ordered a beef or steak dish, my feeling would have been different given that they are, after all, a chop house."}
{"text":"Oh Cleveland Chop you have earned a special place in my heart after tonight's dining experience!  It started the moment I walked in.  I was greeted by the biggest, friendliest smile ever.  It was a smile that understood that I took the time to venture downtown, pay for parking, and walk a 1/4 mile in the snow just to patronize this establishment.  The smile said 'I Thank You for choosing us!' Sigh... Off to a great start!  I made my way over to meet my friend and was greeted by yet another big smile who asked me would I like to order anything.  I perused the happy hours selections and settled on the libation known as Veranda.  My Veranda arrived in a her delicious, pink glory and from the first taste I knew that this would be the beginning of a beautiful relationship!   My friend and I made our way over to our reserved table.  It's Restaurant Week in Downtown Cleveland so there is a pre-fixe menu to choose from for $30.   At the table we were greeted warmly by our server Dori! It seems she's been around Cleveland Chop for eons as she mentions that she's given it her 'best years'.  Lol. Humor from your server is a plus I must say.  Dori goes over the menu and we both select the market salad to start, the blackened scallops and shrimp with cheddar grits for the entrée, and the cheesecake with raspberry drizzle.  Excitement!! (Say this with a French accent).    Dori brings over a nice warm skillet of cornbread with honey butter dolloped on top.  I love corn bread. I especially love corn bread with corn IN it.  And I darn near die over corn bread with corn in it topped with honey butter!  The pearly gates of heaven have smiled on me!  Dori returns with the market salad and asks if we were in a rush.  No not at all my Sweet Girl. We're here to hang.  Dori says she'll stagger putting our courses in so we have time to leisurely dine.  I love this woman.  Our market salad had soo many components to it.  Grapes and grape tomatoes.  Slivered almonds and pear. Crumbled Gouda and English cucumbers. The light vinaigrette becomes more full bodied as you take bite after bite.   After requesting another skillet of corn bread, Dori arrives with our entrées.  Beautifully plated sit the shrimp and scallops.  Nestled in the middle is a frothy looking portion of cheddar grits complemented with a fresh tomato sauce.  The first bite was taken and it was time for Mouthgasm 2015 to begin.  This is not a dish to scarf down. You savor it.  You love it. You wish you could marry the chef after it.  It was divine!   All along our server Dori has checked on us to make sure all is well.  She's even offered to take our photos for us as she notices the several selfies that are being taken.  She's a peach.   After we finish our entrées, Dori arrives with desert.  Cheesecake drizzled with raspberry. Note...If you don't care for raspberry, the kitchen will whip you up any topping that you desire.   Now that's SERVICE!    After desert my friend and I laze around and enjoy the calm, yet lively atmosphere.  The steady banter of patrons immersed with the sounds of cool jazz.  It's just a lovely evening at Cleveland Chop.   Overall the dining experience was TOPS!  Cleveland Chop represents CLE well.  We give you all thumbs and 2 tongues up! Keep up the great work!  We'll definitely be back!    Risa S."}
{"text":"We had a very good meal here.  I had whiskey braised short rids, with white cheddar mash and a couple of glasses of wine.  My husband got the steak with a Worcestershire sauce on top of it and a couple of glasses of wine also.  We shared an excellent salad and the meals came with hot buttered corn bread that was excellent.  I got the brownie for dessert with a salted ice cream.  Can't complain about anything.  Very good meal."}
{"text":"Great food! I had salmon and my fiancé had steak it was amazing I mean melt in your mouth good. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a normal, non-chain steakhouse. This fit the bill. Everyone was super nice - from the hostess to our waitress. Our waitress was especially friendly - I gave her a hug even after dinner!  We started with the stuffed peppers which you don't see that often on a menu. It was a nice size portion for three of us to share. It comes with three large peppers pleasantly filled with sausage, parm and some creamy cheese. 4 slices of crispy, buttery toasted slices to help sop all that tomato sauce.  I ordered the 6oz filet, chedder mashed and I split a side of corn gnocchi with my friend. We weren't sure what to expect with the corn gnocchi - but it was standard potato gnocchi with sauteed veggies.   It was a really delightful meal. I'd happily go back to this place."}
{"text":"Ate here twice over Christmas 2015 and had a wonderful experience both times. We had their ribeye steak, seafood Alfredo, calamari, and desserts. All the food was expertly prepared and absolutely delicious.  Calamari was the best I have ever had. The atmosphere is charming, well decorated, in the service impeccable. The prices are very reasonable and an over all great value."}
{"text":"Had dinner here a few weeks ago for our anniversary and was impressed. We had drinks and happy hour at the bar before dinner. HH specials are a good deal - especially the drink prices. We had the ahi tuna tacos and they were good (but small portion for HH). I had the French onion soup which was very good. Husband had the crab bisque -- waiters warned us it was thick/heavy and boy was it. Would probably not order again w a meal. I had the filet for dinner and it was exceptional, but was too full to enjoy:( All in all a great experience.   UPDATE: went back for HH before the Cavs game. Sat at  bar and waitress was great (again). Drinks exceptional. Ordered the ahi tuna again and was perfect. Also tried the lobster nachos -- probably the worst I've ever had. Chips were stale and sauce was tasteless. Also tried the loaded buffalo tenders and they were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Been here twice this past week. My friends visit regularly and were eager to bring me along. My first visit was during happy hour and was very impressed with the selection of drinks and food. The special runs from 4-7 everyday except Saturday. The appetizers were discounted but I choose to go with a 1/2 price pizza. Laura, our server, was very helpful, recommending her favorites. The pepperoni pizza was definitely the right choice and sided it with an Oberon, a summer seasonal draft still running on tap.   Second visit, I returned for Sunday brunch with the same friends. Sitting down, were given very tasteful cinnamon rolls. The Bloody Mary is thick with a kick, but definitely worth a try if that's your drink. I'd recommend the breakfast burrito, which was ordered by almost the whole table. Good sized, and the mix of pork, eggs and veggies was just the start to my day I needed. Topped with guacamole as well. I know I'll be back for more chop and not to mention checking in here gets you a coupon through the yelp app: free app with an entree purchase!"}
{"text":"the food here is really delicious. id only order an appetizer here if you have a lot of people to share, or are REALLY hungry. because they start you off with amazing homemade cornbread, and the entrees come with a starter salad thats pretty huge. the dressing on the salad is a tasty vinaigrette that's not too overpowering. i had the filet mignon oscar, which was awesome! it was two medallions topped with lump crab with home made bernaise sauce, and some steamed asparagus and white cheddar mashed potatoes on the side. YUM! everything was cooked to perfection. i also had an IPA, which was tasty and hoppy. my only complaint about the experience is that the bathrooms were a mess. two stalls had water/urine (i dont want to know) all over the seats, another one had no toilet paper, and another one had a broken toilet seat. when the dinners are $20-36/plate, i'd expect nicer facilities."}
{"text":"Arrived at this place after exploring downtown by foot. The outside looked elegant and promising. Service from our waitress was good. Not the best, not the worst either. The hostess didn't make small talk and was on her phone when not tending patrons. Whatever happened to acting professional at work?   Anyways, onto the decor. It had nice ambiance. Had me fooled for a minute. I thought it was going to be more upscale. My husband ordered a burger that came with sweet potato fries served in a basket. I liked the presentation. I ordered the salmon, one of the pricier menu items. Let's just say I can prepare a better salmon at home. The belly was still attached to my salmon and so was the skin. A big no no in my book. Seasoning was fine. The risotto had a good amount of mushroom but the seasoning was bland- was in dire need of salt.   Didn't get to try any desserts. Felt too full after all that risotto and cornmeal bread appetizer which I forgot to mention. The cornmeal comes warm in a small cast iron skillet, accompanied with butter that melts right onto your bread.   Overall, not disappointed nor impressed either. Will keep checking out places around Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Loved the sampler!  It is a very large platter but the \"cigars\", calamari, tacos, wings and dip was amazing. Because we go the sampler my husband and I got burgers, but they were just as tasty. We will be adding to this our \"favorite placed to eat in Cleveland\" list and will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner plans with my sister-in-law and her husband on Saturday - and settled on Cleveland Chop after I persuaded them to give this a shot, since they wanted Italian.  Last time I had been there was when it was Chop House - and loved it.  The evening started out great - we ordered some drinks (great craft beer list on tap) and the lightly breaded calamari as an appetizer.  It was delicious.  Then came the salads that we ordered to accompany our meals - wedge, Caesar and market greens.  Loved the homemade dressings.  Oh, by the way, we had a super friendly and attentive server, by the name of Christine - she was great.  My sister-in-law and I both ordered the prime rib (12oz for her (medium); 14 oz for me(medium-rare)).  And this is where it went downhill.  Her prime rib was served first.  Looked great.  When she cut into it, it was probably a bit more red than she had liked, but she was fine with it - especially since the outside had a nice crust on it.  When mine came out, it looked OK until I cut into it.  Oddly, the outside of it was more red (or pink) and juicier than the inside.  The inside was medium-well at best - just barely pink.  Since this was a $30 piece of meat, I decided to ask for another cut that was more to my liking.  I even told our server that I would prefer it to be cooked more like my sister-in-laws (oftentimes, when you return a cut of beef - indicating that it's been cooked too much - they'll return with a piece that is as rare as gets.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what I got.  In fact, it didn't even look/taste like it had been cut from one that had been slow roasted.  This was the rawest, most unflavorful, tough piece of prime rib I have ever had.  Once again, I apologized to Christine and said \"i'm sorry, but this is just way too rare, can we try one more time?\".  A couple minutes later, someone from the kitchen - with a disgusted look on their face - brought out the same piece (the slice from my knife was still there) and hadn't been cooked any further.  At that point, I gave up.  I had hoped to at least eat around the edges where it's typically more cooked and flavorful, but unfortunately, the whole piece was nothing but fat and extremely raw/rare meat.  I really enjoyed the cheddar mashed potatoes though.    Boy did I really want to like this place - especially since I'm the one who selected it.  Unfortunately, I probably will never return since there are so many other premiere steak houses in Cleveland.  Next week, we'll check out Red."}
{"text":"I met a friend at Cleveland Chop just for a drink at the bar. The beer list was decent, I went with a local seasonal beer. We were the only ones at the bar, so the bartender was attentive. Pretty forgettable experience."}
{"text":"The Corn Bread was a nice alternative to the traditional bread offering prior to dinner.  I ordered the Short Ribs, with mashed potatoes and green beans with gravy.  The meal was decent, Short Ribs were tougher than expected but decent flavor.  Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans were aa nice complement to the protein.  Nice selection of local beers.  Julie the waitress was very pleasant and helpful.  I may give it a second chance but would not order the same meal."}
{"text":"This is one of the best steakhouses I've been to! The atmosphere is really great and comfortable, service is friendly, and compared to other steakhouses in the area, the prices are reasonable. My boyfriend and I both got steaks, which were cooked perfectly medium rare, and we shared the calamari appetizer. The complimentary cornbread is also to die for. I always look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself, I ordered the Calamari with Creamy Wasabi Sauce as my appetizer which was slightly under flavored and oily but delicious none the less. For entrée I ordered Tenderloin Tips with White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes and Garlicky Spinach. I enjoyed the  steak and was pleasantly surprised by the lightly sweeten sauce and crispy onions. The service for me is what made the meal most enjoyable. My server Shawn was extremely pleasant, and efficient on all measures. The odds of me going back are good. Good job and keep making good food."}
{"text":"BRUNCH=AMAZING! We had a group of 4 visiting from out of town over the weekend. I saw online that you could make reservations in advance so we did that. The brunch menu had plenty of drink and food options. After we ordered our drinks, our waitress brought out complementary cinnamon rolls. They were delicious and very unexpected! Our food was out within 15 minutes. I went with the crab cake bennedict which was beyond words. My boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy, another girl got the breakfast burrito- everything was very very good. About every 5 minutes someone at our table would say \"wow this is just so good\". The waitress was great the food runners were great. I can't say enough good things! We will definitely be coming back next time we are in town :)"}
{"text":"In from out of town stopped for a late lunch. Amazing cornbread great steak great staff"}
{"text":"Absolutely not worth the price. In my opinion, it seemed like they had all food made ahead of time and then they just grabbed a steak and side and brought it out. Everything came out super fast, but the food wasn't even hot. -drinks: I had an old fashioned and was kind of thrown off when there was an actual orange at the bottom. My boyfriend had a craft beer which was tasty.  -appetizer: we got the bacon wrapped bleu cheese stuffed shrimp. You can tell it had been sitting in a container because it was barely warm and the bacon was not crispy at all (which made the fat pretty gross). -dinner: both of our steaks were not properly cooked. When you pay $30-40 at a steakhouse, at the minimum you would want the steak to be properly prepared. I ordered a medium steak, and received rare. I also received the incorrect steak because it came with mushrooms and onions on it, which I don't even like/wouldn't order. My boyfriend got the filet oskar, which was tasty. But, he ordered medium rare and received medium well.  We did go on Valentine's Day, but they weren't busy at all. We both left disappointed and agreed we wouldn't recommend or go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to places!!! The shrimp tacos are great! The Chophouse Margarita goes great with them. They also have a good selection of beers on the menu as well! Don't leave without trying the cornbread! Best cornbread ever!!!"}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch was sad.  The breakfast meats were bad, cold and very greasy.  The rest of the offering was cold or just badly prepared.  The omelet area was the exception which was good.  For the price $29.00 they need to really step it up I was ill after eating."}
{"text":"two and a half stars  not bad, not good, just decent  ....not memorable...   OK, so I went back for dinner last night. We wanted to eat some cow, but did not want to venture too far from the 'hood. Service was OK. I did take issue with the server leaving our wine glasses unattended at an empty table while she dropped off other drinks elsewhere.   The food was pricey for what it is. The crab cake appetizer was unremarkable. It had a respectable crab to filler ratio, but it lacked any discernible flavor. Nice fresh corn relish with it, and a sauce of sorts, with a flavor I can't really remember. -Which is either strange, or telling, considering I ate it only a few hours ago. I crab cake, 13 bucks.  My lady had a filet, served wrapped in bacon which was alright. Not my favorite cut of meat, but what I tasted was decent. A huge portion of mashed redskins with white cheddar came with the entree. Seriously, there is about 2 lbs. of mashed potatoes on every plate.  I had the \"Tenderloin Tips\" with a balsamic and stout glaze and mushrooms. I was hoping the meat would be seared on the outside and still pink inside, but alas... It was more like a beef and mushroom stew. The sauce was OK, but could do well with the chef having a heavier hand with the seasonings.   So there you have it. For a steak place, it's quite a few notches down from the heavies like Morton's.   Carry on."}
{"text":"Was here for a business trip and stumbled upon this little gem. Food is above par, atmosphere is great, and the service is phenomenal. Had the steak tips medium rare and they were delicious. My business partner had the mac and cheese and he said it was delicious as well. I'd suggest it to anyone that is new to the area and is looking for a solid place for dinner."}
{"text":"This review is for their Sunday brunch only.  I decided to give the Chophouse a try for their Sunday brunch.  First off when we walked in the place was dead which was a huge red flag as most good places for brunch are packed.  The coffee was god awful (really, who screws up coffee??)  and the orange juice was very watered down.  The eggs Benedict was Incredibly chewy borderline inedible, everything else I tried was mediocre.  I will say the waffles were pretty good though.  The worst part was the bill, incredibly expensive for what you get.  Though I will never return for brunch I looked over their beer menu and it looked intriguing so I might return for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We had the Walleye and it was over the top!! The corn bread appetizer is killer good. Staff was superior to many the other locals here. Food was fast and over the top. Found my new hang out here !!!"}
{"text":"Night two in Cleveland and the boss took us out to the Chophouse. I am definitely a fan of the brew house/restaurant as unoriginal as it may be. The inside is welcoming, the have house brews on tap and the service staff is great.  I went with the peppercorn steak with mashed potatoes and honestly I can say this is one of the better steaks ive ever had. I've experienced many a decent steak house in my day and this steak ranked up there with some of the best. Perfectly cooked, great sauce and a nice compliment with the potatoes. It helped having a couple glasses of Cab to go with it.   The price is not cheap but if you are looking to splurge for a night in Cleveland I would recommend the Chophouse. This is of course coming from an out of towner with not much experience of other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We came in for happy hour, which has a decent selection of food, wine, beer and cocktails on the menu. I think they must have changed chefs because we were disappointed in the food we had. The calamari was okay, but I found it salty. The pizza looked like a frozen pizza they threw in the oven. We will be back for the happy hour drink specials but will probably not eat here any time soon."}
{"text":"My son and I had dinner here before a performance at Playhouse Square. We were seated promptly and had to wait about 7-8 minutes for our server to come take our drink orders.  I honestly wasn't overly enthused with the Moscow Mule I ordered. It had limes in it, but they no actual lime juice (I think they threw it in as garnish and not as an integral part of the drink.)  We each ordered appetizers. I enjoyed their deconstructed version of caprese salad, Tomato/Tomato. The seasoned bread wedges served with it were fantastic. For our main entree, I ordered the ribeye and my son ordered the sirloin. The steaks were cooked to the proper temperatures and the mashed potatoes were delicious. Mid-dinner I ordered another Moscow Mule, hoping for an improvement from the first drink. Unfortunately that drink came at the very end of my meal and was just as unsatisfying.  Our server was polite, but I found her somewhat inattentive and hurried.  We literally had to wait until we were each almost done with our steaks to actually get steak knives.  It's a steak place!!!!!  How does that happen?  I feel like I'm being pretty gracious with a 4-star review considering the service and food quality was not on par with the price point. Doubt I'd eat here again. Go to Red, the Steakhouse if you're looking for great service and steaks at that price."}
{"text":"Cleveland Chop is a great place to have within walking distance if you live downtown.   Although I think the dinner menu is a bit pricy, I do love their awesome happy hour specials. The drinks and appetizers make for a great evening and you can walk out with a couple drinks, app and tip for $20 or less.  I actually discovered my favorite wine here a couple years ago, and will happily pay their happy hour price for a few glasses!   The bar has one of those ice cooling features to keep you drinks cold which is pretty cool, and there's also shuffle board to play with your friends.   For dinner, they serve a melt in your mouth cornbread starter which is delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner during a business trip to Cleveland. The experience was great. The food was amazing, even though they did mess up my steak (minus 1 star because I will still eat my steak how it was brought out), although I did not request it that way.   So the ambience inside is nice, slightly dark seats spaced apart for more romantic and secluded conversations. Staff is dressed like an upscale restaurant.   Now the food is great! Even though my fillet mignon was cooked incorrectly it was still good and the greens I had were great as well.   Prices are that of a fancier steakhouse not your average run of the mill roadhouse style steakhouse.   If youre ever in the area and want a steak, I cannot say The Chop cant be beat, cause I was a visitor. What I can say is give this place a try."}
{"text":"I visited for happy hour on a Wednesday evening in September.  I had a pilsner and a pale ale to drink, both were good.  For dinner I ordered the NY strip med rare. It and the mashed pototoes were also quite good.  The bar was nice, the service was attentive, and the food was great."}
{"text":"I go there for happy hour and Sunday brunch.  Their happy hour is among the best in downtown Cleveland. A good list of on tap options and cocktails for very cheap. their chop wheat is absolutely heavenly.  Their brunch is also a very nice. The pancakes are delicious and those sweet rolls... Don't even get me started!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best French onion soup I've ever had... You might not like it if you don't like fried onions and cheese, in which case, none of my reviews will be of use to you, because my love for cheese is unmatched. The crab bisque was also amazing, and my filet was prepared perfectly...Service was a tad slow, and my husband's prime rib was a little chewy. I've heard the brunch is amazing, and they've got a good happy hour - so I'll be back for more than just the perfect soup."}
{"text":"We decided on Cleveland Chop after an appointment at Cleveland Clinic. We are from Akron but since we were in the area decided to try something new.   Walking in the decor has an open speak-easy feel with deep bold paint on the walls, exposed brick, and dark wood architectural details.   We came in on a Monday afternoon after lunch time. They allowed us to order off of the Dinner menu. We chose the Ahi Poke Tacos and the Steak \"Cigars\" (basically Philly cheesesteak egg rolls). Both were phenomenal. My husband ordered French onion soup, some of the best I've ever had.   For entrees, my mother ordered the short rib grilled cheese which was PACKED with tender short rib meat and such a delicious choice. My husband had tenderloin tips in a sort of wine sauce (reminded me of Marsala sauce except darker) served with Cheddar mashed potatoes and I had an 8oz. Filet Mignon with fries.   My reasoning for 4 stars instead of 5 has to do with meat quality. My husbands tenderloin tips were extremely tough. My filet Mignon (which set us back nearly 40 dollars) was cooked incorrectly the first time (over cooked). When they brought back a new one, it was cooked well but seemed to be tough for a filet Mignon and the seasoning was nowhere to be found.  I wouldn't have had such a problem with the meat except that the name of the restaurant is Cleveland Chop which to me stands for Chophouse. When I think of a chop house I think of a place that should have high quality meat and the BEST steak in town. We were nothing short of wowed by everything EXCEPT for the steak and tenderloin tips. I expected a beautiful seasoning crust on the steak and melt in your mouth quality for the price I paid and it just simply did not meet that standard whatsoever.   I would be willing to try Cleveland Chop again but hope that they will improve their meat quality and or processes for seasoning/tenderizing."}
{"text":"You have to go to local steakhouse to get the flavor of the city. For me, born in Iowa, living by KC, it's a test. Can a local steakhouse hang or out do what I know to be fantastic. Cleveland Chop passes with flying colors!!!! My steak was cook to protection!!!! The bartender was excellent and informative, he gave me the tip about a great breakfast place. The day after St. Paddy's day, you would expect a distant or lack of enthusiasm, no here. Everything from the beer to the desert was excellent!!!! There are plenty of steakhouses to choose from, I'm glad I picked this one."}
{"text":"Been in Cleveland on business for almost a week and in search of a good steak.  Chop is the place to get one.  Had the standard filet.  I did ask for a steak knife but didn't need one.  I was able to cut the steak with a butter knife.  It was delish.  The white cheddar mash potatoes were very delicious as well.  I'd go ahead and skip the Caesar's salad; it wasn't worth the money.  Service was pretty good, but that was because the guy was new.  He was congenial and wanted to do a good job, so no points off for a little lax in service.  Really happy to have spent some time at The Chop."}
{"text":"Went for lunch while in town for work.  A bit spendy for average food and service.  I'd shop around before coming back here, but options in this neighborhood seemed limited.  The IPA I had was okay.  Noting to write home about but not bad either.  Its just A-OK."}
{"text":"We were in town for the clinic and read the reviews on Yelp. Since they were mostly positive we gave them a try. We were not disappointed. We had a very nice meal and the staff were welcoming and friendly. We started with the calamari which was good but would have liked to have more of the wasabi sauce they garnished the plate with. My wife is not a big eater so she ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer and French onion soup for her dinner . Both were delicious and were plenty for her to eat for dinner. I had the Walleye and found it delicious also. I would not hesitate to send a friend to Cleveland Chop and we will probably go back ourselves if we get back in town"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, the mix and match is a great deal, the crab bisque is excellent, the turkey club and a good size salad competed great lunch, really great spot especially if you can sit on the back patio area,  good service and great value, would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good lunch spot."}
{"text":"Cleveland has some amazing steakhouses and I've been to many of them. However, it had been a few years since I had been to Cleveland Chop and they had undergone a rebrand/new owner or something of that nature. I decided to try it out during downtown Cleveland Restaurant Week. My hubby ordered off the RW menu and had three courses for $30, a great deal. I chose to order off the regular menu.  The ambiance is fine with music playing and it being darker on the inside. Our waitress was very friendly, chatting us up, taking our place photo, etc.  Their bread service consists of corn bread with a little kick of jalapeño. It was delicious and the highlight of the meal.  I had an 8 ounce filet with their white cheddar mashed potatoes. The steak was just okay and they served it with their house steak sauce which neither my husband or I was a fan of. It tasted okay at first, but then left a terrible after taste in your mouth. The waitress told me they were known for their mashed potatoes and while good, they didn't blow we away.  Hubby had the Caesar salad which was basic, but he dressing was good. He got twin stuffed lobster tails with crab, which were tasty. His side was broccolini which was just okay. For dessert, we had chocolate mousse which was good, but nothing over the top.  If wanting to go to a great steakhouse in Cleveland I'd recommend Red or Strip."}
{"text":"I come to Cleveland chop frequently. Especially for happy hour. The food is usually good and drinks are pretty strong. Tonight was a little bit different. I ordered the lobster bisque  and it tasted stale! There were tons of onions in it and hardly any lobster. I asked the waitress to sub it out for the happy hour pizza... another bust. The pizza was over cooked and the crust was burnt.  It seems to me that due to the inconsistency in the happy hour menu, the taste and look of the food is suffering. They continuously change the happy hour menu, subbing for cheaper less tasty items. Management needs to do better, chefs are not up to par... hopefully they improve and fast!"}
{"text":"It's got potential! I was pretty bummed when I heard the Chophouse was closing, but I'm excited that the Cleveland Chop filled the space. The bar area is much bigger (too bad they didn't extend the patio).  My friends and I went for brunch and the service could've been way better. It took a while to get drinks and took even longer to get the drink that our waitress forgot.  The menu looks great, but I think they need some more time to work on the execution of the dishes. Eggs Benedict should be runny and not hard. Pierogis should be soft and not over cooked.  I'll attribute these fixable items to opening month jitters.  Looking forward to trying it again!"}
{"text":"I am a fresh out of college student with a fairly limited budget and I found the quality and price of Cleveland Chop to be extremely satisfying. I took my girlfriend there for our 3 year anniversary and everything was amazing especially the complementary corn bread. Would highly recommend Cleveland Chop for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Went on a double-date with my wife and a friend and we had a great dinner experience at the Cleveland Chop House.  My wife and I each started off with a Guinness and we ordered steaks (of course) for dinner.  I had a delmonico and my wife had a strip.  They were both cooked how we like them - medium.  The steaks tasted delicious and I got a side of mashed potatoes that was also delicious.  The prices were reasonable and given its location, this is a great place.  Recommend!  http://www.chophouse.com/LocationHome.php?FKLocationID=10091"}
{"text":"The brunch is better than the dinner and lunch. I like the bread and cinnamon buns they give before dinner and brunch, respectively. Nice atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"My flight just got in..bags Dropped off at the hotel..I explored a little and ended up here! Very nice atmosphere and the service was nice as well.   I got the loaded chicken tenders as my free appetizer, which was ok, the double mac & cheese with blackened shrimp was great I should've gotten additional shrimp though. For dessert I got the banana cream pie, definitely the way to end my first visit here!"}
{"text":"I always feel very comfortable at Cleveland Chop. The booths are nice and roomy, and it's hard not to feel delighted when they bring a warm pan filled with cornbread to your table when you arrive.   The cocktails are good (I've tried two of the mules. The traditional is good and I enjoyed the Kentucky Kickass tonight in honor of my love for Louisville, and it was a nice twist on the original.) The food is bordering on great. I don't think this would qualify as a favorite place I can't wait to go back to, but it's solid, the presentation is nice, and there's lots of flavor.   Tonight I had the chicken piccata. Be prepared for a very strong lemon taste. But the creamy, thick mashed potatoes underneath balanced it out. I could have done without the super salty capers, but hey, I'd rather have too much flavor than not enough. You can always scrape them off. It was a hefty portion... Even enough to save some for lunch tomorrow.   Our server was very sweet, and seemed to actually care that we had a good experience. It wasn't too busy, so we lingered after paying, and she kept coming back to fill our water. All around an enjoyable evening!"}
{"text":"I am specifically rating the Happy Hour. I met some colleagues up after work and this is one of my new favorite happy hours downtown! The bar was not too crowded, parking is fairly easy around 5:30 and the specials were awesome. They had happy hour pricing on beer, wine and cocktails which is a huge plus in my book because there is something for everyone. The lobster nachos were very good and I can't wait to come back and try more on the menu or have dinner here. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! My wife and I came here in January from Chicago  before the BULLS/Cavs game and my Bulls won just so everyone knows lol. Coming from Chicago I wasn't expecting much from Chop and Cleveland itself but it was 5 stars one of the best steakhouses my wife and I been to.   Service was great it was a Friday night and not packed at all plenty of room. Our server was great very attentive, polite, and funny, the 3 things I look for in service. We started with the sampler and DAMN it was good! Huge plate of calamari ahi tuna tacos chicken strips artichoke dip and the infamous steak cigars which were bomb.   We were shocked that sides came WITH the steaks. Being from Chicago everything is expensive and served a la carte but not at Cleveland Chop. I ordered the bone-in ribeye which was one of the best I've had very tender and juicy and only $45. Wife got the filet it was like $35 or something but it was also the most tender filet she ever had. The sides we ordered with were potatoes which were bomb too the Brussels sprouts were decent. Dessert we got the brownie/ice cream thing which was good but it would've been great of the brownie was hot!  All in all dining here was awesome and the bill for the 2 of us was only $130. Back home in Chicago it would've been an easy $200. Will def come back here to watch my Bulls or Bears when we play Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"While visiting in Cleveland, I went to Cleveland Chop House for my birthday with my coworker.  We arrived early enough to order off their tavern menu aka happy hour menu.  All items are $3 off.  It was a great deal!  I, actually, ended up ordering off of their regular dinner menu, but did manage to take advantage of their happy hour offer of $3 off their Sesame Calamari.  It was really good!!!   I ordered the Sesame Salmon with garlic mashed potatoes.  The portion of garlic mashed potatoes was HUGE.  Everything I had tasted great and had enough left over to fill me up for lunch the next day.  The creamy spinach the salmon sits on top of was soo yummy.  I definitely recommend to anyone that would like to have a great happy hour meal for a good price!"}
{"text":"Like this place better than some of the other bar place in downtown Cleveland. Tried their wings and burger taste better than many other yelp three star restaurants. They also have some games to play."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is wonderful. Very soothing music and relaxed seating.   The evening started with sweet corn bread that was amazing. Being someone from the south, I am used to the flavor, but this was not dry at all.   Of course the reason for my visit was the steak. I have to admit that most places leave me wanting A1 for my steak, but here is doesn't need it. I recommend this place to anyone in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We LOVE Cleveland Chop! Especially the Executive Chef, Dave! He is incredible! You cannot go wrong with ordering a steak and telling them to have the chef make it his way. The service is impeccable, the atmosphere is fabulous and the food is always wonderful. The cornbread they serve before your meal is delicious.   Save room for dessert! This is also a great place to host a special event."}
{"text":"Been there once. Nice food, relatively big portions. I had the berkshire pork chop which was very good. Tenderloin tips were delicious. seafood fans will appreciate the lobster and shrimp gnocchi.  nice atmosphere, friendly stuff, a little bit expensive. I would go there again!"}
{"text":"Went on dinner date before a play at playhouse square.  Great service.  Excellent food and dessert.  Appetizer started dinner off right.  Romantic atmosphere.  She loved it."}
{"text":"I went to lunch today with my boyfriend and we both ordered salads with chicken. To star, it took 45 minutes to get our food. I took a bite and under the lettuce that I picked up with my fork was a dead fly. Obviously, I immediately sent the food back. The server said 'sorry' and walked away clearly frustrated. He came apologizing again and asked if I wanted anything else. Unfortunately, since it was in the middle of the work day and I had already waited 45 minutes, I was starving and needed something so I ordered a chicken breast and some veggies. I wanted nothing to do with another salad. The manager came over to me and said ' I hope you're not too grossed out, I am so sorry.' My meal was comped, but my boyfriends salad was not. I understand that these things happen, but when something this disgusting happens, I firmly believe the management should do everything to make the situation correct. In my eyes, they should've taken care of our entire meal. What they did not realize is that I am an Executive Assistant and Office Manager at a global marketing firm. We often have clients, visitors and other colleagues in our office and Cleveland Chop has long time been a list of our favorite local spots for lunch, dinner or quick internal meetings over meals. I can assure you, they've lost business from 15 folks in our office + the frequent visitors we get. We'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice place! Ambience and food were great! I had the Seafood Fettuccine since I don't eat much red meat and I was pleasantly surprised. It was loaded with seafood and not too heavy.   Lauren our server was very polite and attentive. Desert is in it's way. Great dinner!"}
{"text":"Awesome Steaks and Seafood along with all of the beer you could want from Ale's to Pilsner's. You will feel like you walked into the 1940's when you step in this building. It is a beautiful, old building that is casual.  The atmosphere is very warm and friendly and the sauces they use on their steaks are worth coming back time and time again!"}
{"text":"there was no char or color on the steak - lack of flavor. The meat itself was quite good, but it could've been elevated.  burger was overwhelmed with excessive amount of blue cheese. components could've been enhanced without the cheese.  Fried oysters were a waste of money. what are you guys thinking putting this on the menu for the price you are charging. Bits of overcooked pork bellies, terrible bland sauce, and tiny fried oysters in a shitty batter. Does not make sense to me at all.  Best part was the cornbread, which is complimentary.  call this place \"Cleveland Cornbread\" with other items on menu with own discretion."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and one of my favorite shrimp cocktails!  The spicy bloody mary sauce is just perfect!  We ordered a few other things, including the deviled eggs, which were good, but not great, but the amazing bartenders put extra candied bacon on them for me.  Yummy, but too much mayo for me.  The other items on happy hour menu were good, but not remarkable (bacon wrapped shrimp was better than average, but very filling), but the staff is very friendly and accomidating.  Great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a late night of drinking with the guys and this place hit the spot. Brunch menu was nice but the only draw back was you couldnt order bloody marys until a certain time or something and that was a main reason to go there. Over all decent place to eat."}
{"text":"First, a correction to the hours, it's open on Sunday. Veggie Omelet was a little bland and the Bloody Mary was a little too spicy, but both were fresh. Server was friendly, but a little slow to get started. Overall, the atmosphere was welcoming, comfortable, and clean."}
{"text":"Went here for a group lunch.  10 of us and the service was fantastic.  Our server was right on top of all our needs.   I had a grilled chicken salad and the portions were hearty.  Tasted good, but nothing memorable.  Other people at the table had pizza (very generous size).  Comp cornbread is tasty.  We also had some apps such as the mushrooms and it was very good.    All in all, not a bad place for lunch.  Clean and good atmosphere.  I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Premium Steaks cooked to order.  Wine list offered options.  Quality was excellent.  The Staff here are professional friendly and customer focused.  There is a pub or restaurant option.  Watch the game or entertain guests.  Recommend.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit, the staff was extremely nice and very attentive.  We had a large group and they took very good care of us.  Food was excellent, drinks superb!  We really enjoyed the evening, great atmosphere.  I'll be back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the most underrated restaurants in Cleveland. Every time I go, I have an amazing meal! To start off, the complimentary corn bread with sweet honey butter is to die for!  The poke ahi tacos and lump crab cakes are great. They serve the crab cake app with a delicious fresh little salad that is flavored to perfection. My boyfriend normally gets the blackened shrimp gnocchi which is out of this world. One time I got the catch of the day and it was mahi-mahi served with spinach and tomato risotto. I absolutely loved it!!   Also, they have an amazing Sunday brunch!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place in Cleveland! My friends and I stopped here for a big steak dinner and we were not disappointed! The staff greeted us immediately upon walking in the door and we were seated in a cozy and quiet booth.  Then we were served some delicious homemade bread and ordered right away. I recommend any of the steaks or salads and the side gnocchi! Although I thought the gnocchi could have been a whole meal in itself, it was my favorite part. It was in a creamy white sauce and every bite was better than the last. My friends ordered various dishes and loved them all. A must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this gem of a restaurant to be the perfect ending to a perfect day.  The service was excellent as was the food.   I had the Louisiana Shrimp with spinach and crabmeat risotto.  My shrimps were cooked perfectly and the risotto was so delicious! My husband had the 6oz filet and said it was cooked perfectly.  Wonderful ambiance and not noisy."}
{"text":"Not a bad dinner spot, if you can find parking. They offer valet parking which you should just do. It'll get your evening off to a better start than endlessly circling looking for parking. I really liked the atmosphere and they were playing great music all night. Our waiter seemed a little flustered all evening and misinformed us about the specials, but no harm done.  For appetizers we got the crab cake and calamari. The calimari was a little chewy for my taste and I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce the put on it, but I liked the dipping sauce. The crab was great and I sort of wish I had ordered it for my entree. I had the mac n' cheese because I was intrigued by their potato chip crumb topping. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't order it again. The cheese sauce was incredibly thick and didn't stick to the style of noodle they went with. I snuck a bite of the lobster mashed potatoes off of my boyfriend's plate and wish I had just gotten a bowl of that!  All and all a good place and I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a nice dinner spot downtown that isn't crazy expensive."}
{"text":"Three stars?  I say Chophouse is better than that....by a whole star!    Typically I just hit it up for happy hours, because honestly, it's one of the best happy hours in downtown.  I've also stopped by for steak and am perfectly contented by it.    My only regret is that it comes with a starch and not a starch/vegie combo.  Plus, when I asked for rare, I got a medium...but it was Prime Rib so there often isn't as much they can do with that."}
{"text":"Don't go here thinking you're going to be getting some local flavor. I went here on the recommendation of the bartender at my hotel. It wasn't until my bill came that I realize what this place was. Yes, the beer tasted familiar. That's because this place is owned by Rock Bottom Brewery. The sign is the same, the beer is the same.   Its not bad, but its not stellar either. With the number of other resturants within 2 blocks of this place, I imagine you can have a better dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have been here twice, a few years ago, and the food is outstanding. Portions are huge and it can be pricey, but you will come away satisfied. Needless to say, you want to order steak or pork chops. I had a NY strip that was to die for!  This is in the warehouse district of Cleveland, a really nice area to walk around, get a drink and watch the people.  Cleveland Rocks!"}
{"text":"This place was a staple of mine when I visited town in its pervious incarnation as the Chop House.  Although it is a new entity, it's hard to discern the difference.  My wife and I met my brother and his spouse for dinner before last night's Tribe game.  At 515, the place was quiet, not many had settled in.  My wife and I both ordered the Bleu Filet, my brother the steak burger, his with the tenderloin tips.  All dishes were prepared to specifications and delicious.  I really like this place.  But it doesn't seem to have that added punch, that pizzaz that warrants five stars.  But, hey, four stars...you can't really go wrong by choosing this place!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Happy hour specials are excellent value. Good selection of drinks and small plates. I tried the whiskey braised short ribs and really enjoyed them. Loaded baked potato was huge and tasty. First time here and will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night.  I ordered the rib eye, one of their specials of the night, and she ordered the filet mignon.  The food was good, everything cooked perfect.  The staff was nice and the service was great.  We enjoyed our meal here and will come back."}
{"text":"Anticipating a great lunch. But I kept anticipating and waiting and not eating.  This felt like health care reform and i was waiting for the other shoe to drop. First the hostess saw us waiting outside. We pulled on the door and were denied like a 16 year male on his first date. There were others waiting, it was 11:25a. Chophouse opens at 11:30.  I was almost tempted to go to another place but my client really wanted to eat here.  At 11:35 doors opened and we were seated. Here's where the epic trilogy begins. We were quickly asked for our drink order and given menus. 10 minutes later waitress comes back and asks if we want any starters. I asked what the special for lunch was. She looked at me like deer in headlights and went to find out. 10 minutes later she comes to tell me the special. Asks if we are ready to order, we kinda were not ready but pushed my guest to order before we lost her to the black hole she kept on getting sucked into. I ordered the sirloin and so did my guest. Also ordered inion rings as a starter. After reminiscing with my guest and recounting our teenage years trying to get into clubs on the east bank of the flats when we were underage, still no onion rings.  I said I really don't want the rings now if they come out with my entree. Like a shooting star, the rings appeared out of nowhere. Steaks come soon after and were cooked to order.  Steak was ok. I liked their house steak sauce. Onion rings were very big and tasty. The waitress offered us dessert after the meal and recommended the apple pie. Ordered it and 10 minutes later...maybe she was taking smoke breaks in between, she told us the apple pies were still being baked. You think she would have checked before she started her shift. She then recommended the chocolate cake. Said it was \"to die for.\". Cake was a little stale and was not even close to being anything special.  The food was below average, service was very slow. Come on chophouse and represent the restaurants in the warehouse district. If you can't hang then please take the \"Cleveland\" out of your name. It fuels the fire for bad comments regarding Cleveland. If you read this far you now have a feeling of how long the wait will be here."}
