{"text":"Earned every star do not pass this place up! Amazing food amazing family. I've never been welcomed like we were when we walked in here. Fantastic!! You will not be sorry!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by the Express Deli after going the the home & garden show at the I-X Center.  We were just looking for something easy & quick to take back home and this establishment definitely hit the mark.  First, the owners/proprietors are incredibly nice & welcoming, we both ordered the turkey Reuben and they were very good. A good portion of sliced turkey and the 1,000's island was spot on, loved the rye bread but could of had a little more slaw - make sure that you get the garlic sauce too. While we were waiting she gave us a generous portion of corned beef to try ( if I hadn't of had a corned beef sandwich earlier in the week I would have gotten it, very good & lean), and then when I mentioned that it was our first time here she made a small pastrami sample with rye bread, garlic sauce & pickles.   Long story short, we will be back for the good food & even nicer people!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Favorite lunch place around where I work. Not too expensive, it's well worth the $6-7 price."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service and food.  Rueben was fantastic, best I have ever had.  Very reasonable price too."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way back to airport and glad I did!  Got the pastrami wrap and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich I ever had !! There were 5 of us first time there. They gave us a sample plate! The service was like we were part of the family! We had different sandwiches and all were great!"}
{"text":"Just picked up a rental car at the airport upon arrival and needed something to eat.  Not knowing what was around, I checked yelp and Express Deli was close by and had good reviews. I will also give this place a great review. I had to go with the classic Rueben sandwich on rye. It was delicious. And the gentleman making the sandwich was a very friendly person and I enjoyed visiting with him while he fixed my sandwich. Just FYI, you order at the counter and there are only about three tables if you are eating there. I was there around 2:00 so no problem with getting a table. Not sure what it would be like at noon. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. We stopped in from the airport and Pierre and his son immediately made us feel more than welcome. The food was excellent and it was a pleasure to talk to them both. Quite a gem :)"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new deli ever since my previous favorite closed; I've been ever so lucky to have found this place. The family owned deli is a gem in a city of coal. Their customer service is outstanding especially in reference to their first time customer routine where the give you samples of their popular sandwiches. The prices are fair especially considering their portion size is equivalent to two. If you're looking for good food & a respectable loving family environment, look no further."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The food is amazing and the service is the best I've experienced."}
{"text":"Worst place in town. For one my sandwich was undercooked and I got food poisoning from it and when I told the owner he told me to FUCK OFF. How rude I told him to get his shit together and sell it to his mom for $10. Then he banned me for life because I wanted a refund. So glad I'm not aloud to go there no more THANKS"}
{"text":"If you are in Cleveland, make sure you go here.  If you don't you are crazy, crazy, crazy.  The food is fantastic and the owners and staff are wonderful.  They really make your experience special because they do their best in every aspect.  They are very nice people and that food is made with love.  I had the Reuben which was delectable.  We also got hummus and pitas to take back to our hotel room.  All of it - the best you ever ate!"}
{"text":"Friendly smiles, engagement that you completely would not expect. Customer service beyond belief!"}
{"text":"Super place to go, just don't expect to eat there. You will have to take it to go. Get the Reuben wrap."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Food and service at Express Deli did not disappoint! Father and Son both oozing with fun, positive, dynamic personalities. I will be back whenever we travel through Ohio!"}
{"text":"Such a great sandwich! 1st time here and the owner Pierre could not of been nicer!  I'll make this a regular stop for sure! Thank you Pierre!"}
{"text":"The wraps are are so good. Best spot for lunch in the area. Employees are super friendly too."}
{"text":"We stopped by after arriving in town via the airport and had to try based upon the awesome reviews. Once they knew it was our first time, they had us try some samples including the corn beef and turkey, and it was great! Between the quality of the food and their passion towards it, this was a special find, especially with the great hospitality we received. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to repeat what everyone else said, but my experience was identical, from the sampler board to the terrific sandwich served by the friendliest people in the world."}
{"text":"It's worth coming to Cleveland just to try the corned beef. Also, the owner is so welcoming and friendly!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for a quick meal on the go. This is a corner store that offers beer, cigarettes, lottery, snacks and the best sandwiches in the city! For right around $7 you can have your choice of meat (pastrami-excellent, corned beef-made in house, turkey, ham, lamb and chicken gyro and so many more), your choice of bread (Italian, sub or pita wrap-all are very fresh, made locally), cheese and house made sauces (every sauce made in house is just delicious-I recommend the garlic sauce).   This is a locally owned, owner operated, independent business. Pierre, the owner has been here for 14 years and recently lost a lot of business with cut backs and lay offs at the Ford Plant and GM, so I always try to patronize and eat here when in the city. Plus, with as clean as he keeps the place and as wonderful as their customer service is, why not."}
{"text":"I ordered about 15 sandwiches for our St. Patrick's day lunch at my office. When calling to order everyone was lovely to speak with and willing to make all the sandwiches individually. Upon arriving I immediately received warm greetings and noticed how clean the whole place was. They had my order ready and boxed and a kind gentlemen brought it out to my car for me.   Everyone at my office loved the corned beef. Very lean and thinly sliced. Horseradish, mustard, and cheese were all included on the side. They also individually wrapped the pickles which was extra effort for sure.   If you're looking for a friendly, fresh, clean deli this is your spot!"}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich I have ever had.  The owners are extremely friendly and outgoing and made me feel welcome.  They provided a sample of their sandwiches and provided examples of why they are different from other delis.  Love it and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything I have had there was very good! Pierre and his son (and the staff) are very friendly and welcoming. They will even make you a teeny tiny sample sandwich to see if you like it. They are a little pricey but the food is that good!"}
{"text":"Got recommended to try this place because I'm funny about corned beef. I like it lean and less fatty. I walked and was offered a sample tray and I loved everything on it.   I ended up getting the Reuben and it was phenomenal. They put it in a pita and it was surprisingly good. Also, they really care about the customer experience here."}
{"text":"I was told to try this place by a co worker and i was really not impressed the corned beef was gristly and too chewy....maybe undercooked but the real kicker was the cockroach I saw ...yuck!!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't think a deli could consistently get 5 stars but I was mistaken. This place deserves even more. If you let them know that it's your first time they will whip up a small tasting platter for you. From the platter I decided to get a Reuben mostly due to the delicious sauerkraut. The location also had tons of drinks and chips to choose from. The people are great,  the food is great,  what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review. My experience at Express Deli definitely warrants it! This was my first time here and when the owner asked me if it was my first time, he personally prepared a \"sampling\" plate. He carefully took his time to go over everything he prepared. Everything was fantastic. They make everything from scratch except for the bread. After cleaning up the \"sampling\" plate, I chose their signature Rueben wrap. Phenomenal, seriously. From the unsuspecting Storefront, they create some seriously delicious food. Next time I will be getting the pastrami, it was out of this world!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for lunch! Everyone in my office has been running out of ideas on where to eat lunch. We discovered this GEM 3 days ago and have been back everyday! The owner is one of the nicest people you well meet and is very thankful for everyones business.  They always get their orders right and everything is packaged and boxed perfectly.   The Rueben and the Turkey Pepperoni wrap were both amazing.  Just put my order in for the Hot Italian Wrap today.  It's pretty safe to say, my whole company is hooked on this place."}
{"text":"I found out about this establishment by reading a Facebook article, so I decided to give it a shot today, and all I can say is WOWWW!!!!! Their Reuben wrap was out of this world!!!! You have to try it and the customer service is outstanding. From this experience they have definitely gained a loyal customer thanks guys see you soon"}
{"text":"Express Deli gets my Best of 2018 Award for restaurants.  And it's only February 5th of 2018! What lured me initially was the unanimous 91 5-Star rating.  Unbelievable right? Not. Come here and find out for yourself.   As for my experience, it felt like I came home to family upon entering.  There's no better feeling for a lone business traveler. I was asked what I'd like and truthfully answered \"everything\" because it looked and smelled so good. I was asked if it was my first visit and was then honored with a \"taster sampler\" that they offer all their newcomers.  Prior to tasting, an explanation of the development of the taster entices each new flavor.   Downright amazing how this family-owned Lebanese business has perfected deli staples like Reubens and other sandwiches, sides and condiments.  Mike was a fantastic ambassador of his family and their passion.  I thank them again for their hospitality, graciousness and time.  Their passion deserves patrons and are no shortage of them as I sit and eat while I write this review.  They deserve my expedited 5 star review in case someone is nearby looking for great food and service.   Honor this family and establishment with your business and you'll leave wanting to give them your own reward and accolades."}
{"text":"Fantastic Lunch!  I ordered lunch for a corporate meeting from this establishment without any personal reference other than a high Yelp rating.  Thankfully, everything was delicious, far better than the average sandwich take-out.  The service was also excellent and delivery was on time.  We could not have been happier.  The pastrami and Rubens were amazing...as was everything else.  I could not give a higher recommendation.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have lived in New York for 5 years and have never really been a fan of Reubens. Who would have known that the best deli sandwiches (and the best Reuben as a matter of fact) that I will ever have is in Ohio!   I stopped here when I was coming to Cleveland for a brief visit and I must say that the food is not only delicious (they have some secret special sauce for every item), but this is a family owned deli has the friendliest owners! If they know it's your first time there, they will give you a tour and have you taste the famous items on their menu.   Long story short, I don't think I will order a Reuben anywhere else..."}
{"text":"Really tasty wraps & sandwiches made so fast. Family owned with outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Wow. Walked in for the first time, after I tentatively asked for a tune sandwich the gentleman asked me if I had been there before, I told him no so he said he would give me a \"tour\". He took a slice of bread and cut it into 4 and made different miniature sandwiches. They were all good, and he described them all well. I ended up going with the chicken gyro because a patron had told me it was his favorite. They put a home made honey mustard sauce on it which is great. The staff was very helpful and genuinely friendly. Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Wow what a true gem! This mom and pop place was outstanding. From the excellent service and fantastic quality food! Will be back for sure. Going in for the first time we were welcomed by being offered samples of the meats and specialty sandwiches (talk about customer service). The Reuben I ordered was out of this world good. Great spot for lunch and when your craving a delicious sandwich."}
{"text":"After flying into Cleveland from Texas we found this wonderful gem.   To say it was good is an understatement.   Starting out with the sample tray was extraordinarily.   I ordered the Reuben wrap, my wife got the corned beef, one of our friends got the Regular Rueben, and the other got BBQ beef and Chili.    Everything was fantastic; best Rueben I have ever eaten.  We actually plan to eat there before we fly home next week.    It is easy to see why this place has been there for 20 years and is very popular with the locals."}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you! This is a hidden gem. The food and service is always on point. Ive had quite a few of their items over the years, but the Reuben is always my go to. I recently got a wrap platter for a party and it was a hit. If you're looking to mix it up, try the Reuben Mac-n-cheese. It's a great twist on a traditional dish. Exciting to see the growth of this deli and I'm excited to see what they will cook up next."}
{"text":"Went to College/roomed with the owners son, so when you see reviews about the nicest staff and owners, it's true.  They are some of the most genuine people you will meet!  Whenever I'm up that way I always make a point to stop in and either get the pastrami or corned beef wrap with lettuce and their garlic sauce...Mmmm.  So good!  Literally my favorite of any wrap/sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped her on our way to the airport and between the hospitality and the food this is they best deli that I have eaten at at. We ordered the Reuben and pastrami wraps and both unique to the typical sandwiches."}
{"text":"The best Ruben wrap I have had. Passing through town and found this little place. I'll be going out of my way to go back. Lol"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the corned beef sandwich here! Very friendly establishment with great food. Quick service and if it's your first time, let them know so you can try a few samples! Favorite local deli close to work."}
{"text":"A decent deli with food @ very good prices.I work over this way a few times a week and Express Deli is a good place for lunch.I suggest the bbq beef,cornbeef,and macaroni salad.The place is very clean and service is top notch so give express deli a shot."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are AMAZING. I had the Reuben but also tried the turkey and the pastrami and they were all delicious. The corned beef was especially good. And they were soooo nice - let us sample each type of sandwich before and they were so funny with the kids. Super helpful and super yummy. Great place!"}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing Reuben wrap, and my wife enjoyed her veggie Reuben wrap. Before we ordered we were taken on a culinary tour of their house offerings. The owners were so incredibly warm and welcoming. You gotta go!!!"}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough. The combo of veggies and sauces with the fresh pita makes all of the wraps I have tried stellar. The stand out for me is the hummus wrap. Never had anything like it"}
{"text":"I wish I could visit you every day, Express Deli.   My boyfriend and I went based on the amazing reviews and we were NOT disappointed.  The customer service here is top notch."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and my colleague and I were looking for lunch in the way to the airport.  We took a look at Yelp and noticed the great reviews for this place.  We walked in and told them it was our first visit, and they made us up a sampler of their \"specialties\" - corned beef, turkey, pastrami and the Reuben.  The food was SO GOOD - I'm not usually a pastrami fan, but ended up getting a pastrami wrap.  Their corned beef, which I believe they cure in house, was absolutely sublime.  Highly recommended and don't let the convenience store-look location and the less-then-fancy location dissuade you."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches. Outstanding service, very friendly. I could tell locals come here regularly, because they were addressed by the owners on a first name basis. It's near the airport. A must try if you're in Cleveland. I had the Reuben on a pita, and their homemade sauce."}
{"text":"Hard not to try a place that has over 100 ratings and nothing less than 5 stars. This little family deli is  bright spot during travel. I ate here 3 days in a row. They let you try everything on the menu before you buy it. Even if you get full, no charge and come back to order next time. They went above and beyond to cater to a special diet. A+ stuff happening here for a quick stop and go."}
{"text":"Beat sandwiches in Cleveland! Along with the friendliest service I have ever encountered! Try the pastrami wrap!"}
{"text":"Best corned beef out there and the nicest owner! You should make a stop here of you are in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Excellent deli! I walked in and asked \"What's good?\" The man behind the counter happily tells me he will give me some samples. He proceeds to make me some finger sandwiches of their pastrami, turkey and he heats up a small taste of their homemade corned beef. All of them were fantastic. I got a pastrami/corned beef combo on rye. It only took a couple minutes to make. This is another of those \"Diamonds in the Rough\". A very unassuming convenient store that makes killer food and all of their employees have happy attitudes and want you to leave happy. I totally recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Just had my first experience here: AMAZING!! Such nice owners and fantastic sandwiches. Don't think twice."}
{"text":"This deli is amazing. My wife and I were lucky enough to get a taste of their menu as part of tour, and the service and tastings we were given were to die for. There are many places you can go to get a sandwich, but this is one of those places you can go to get something made with a personal touch.   1st, they know how to season or apply the proper dressing to any of their wraps, sandwiches, or other sides. No assembly line dry, flavorless sandwiches and side dishes. 2nd, they have exceptional customer service. They will smile, talk with you, and bend over backwards to make sure you are happy with your order.   This is easily one of the best places to stop in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I love a good, traditional deli, and miss the ones that were on every corner when I worked in New York. Express Deli feels exactly like those corner delis! They made my Jersey Sloppy Joe perfectly -- and didn't make 'that face' when I asked for coleslaw and thousand island on a turkey and swiss sandwich. I Cleveland-ized that sandwich with some stadium mustard, and I was in heaven. It's a bit of a hike from my office, but I've been back a few times, and look forward to trying more of their menu."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and delicious food. It was our first time and we were pretty much full after the samples they gave us. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone is so welcoming and friendly! Not to mention the food is amazing and the place is always sparkling clean! Recommend 100%."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing. This was my first time there and they gave me a \"tour\" which was actually a tour of 4 different sandwiches that they make. They were all phenomenal. I quickly changed my order of soup to the pastrami wrap. Their garlic aioli that they make in house is delicious. I want to buy a bottle of it! I have been trying to save my wrap and take a few bites of it throughout the afternoon to make it last because it is that good! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough! I drove to this deli for lunch based on yelp reviews. As I pulled up, I thought I most certainly had the wrong place. It looks like a crappy old convenience store. Upon entering, I was greeted by the owner. When he found out it was my first time there, he told the person making the food, to give me the \"sample tour.\" The sample tour included 4 tiny sandwiches to sample, and a sample of their homemade meats. I went in for a salad and I came out with a giant Ruben, thanks to my sampling experience! There was also an assortment of side dishes and desserts. The owner and family could not have been more welcoming, generous and customer service oriented! My food was so so delicious! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, friendly staff that makes delicious food! It was our first time visiting so they set up a sample platter for us to showcase their homemade sauces and flavors before we ordered. The Ruben wrap and Pastrami wrap were a hit!  Great food, large portions, good prices, and amazing people. Would highly recommend this deli."}
{"text":"Saw the 100% five star reviews and had to check the place out (first time I've seen that with so many reviews).  Definitely a well deserved 5 stars.  I asked what their most popular dish was, and the person behind the counter told me that he would let me answer my own question.   He then proceeded to carefully prepare a tasting plate with 3 different sandwich samples and a sample of their corned beef (awesome btw).  Each one tasted amazing, but the moment I tasted the reuben, I knew that was what I wanted (he replied that he knew I would want that one, and so he saved it for last).  Best and most unique reuben I've ever eaten.  Price was very reasonable as well.  Definitely coming back tomorrow for the Reuben Mac & Cheese.  Found my new favorite place for when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I just moved to CLE and stumbled upon this gem! First, the service is adorable and perfect and would just go back based on how pleasant the owners are. They seem to really enjoy being there and share that happiness with every customer. Second, their love and light shines true in their sandwiches also!! It was our first time so they quickly prepared samples for us to taste before ordering and then once we decided, again the service was so quick. My group ordered the rueben, the turkey and the veggie wraps and we all loved them! Thank you!"}
{"text":"First of all best Ruben of my life. Secondly, this is the best family owned deli I have ever been to. Wonderful people - wonderful food."}
{"text":"Looks like the inside of a gas station, but the employees were friendly and the sandwiches delicious. The people working the small deli in back were eager to give us samples. We had the pastrami and reuben, both on rye. The pastrami featured super thinly sliced pickles which were amazing. The reuben had nice layer of sauerkraut and just enough 1000 Island dressing. My only knock was the so-so rye.  Try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! Nicest people, close to the airport, and DELICIOUS food. Let them know if it's your first time and they'll give you a little taste tour of their famous corned beef & Reuben sandwich. So glad that I happened upon their precious reviews on here."}
{"text":"Friendly and welcoming. We came from out of town from the airport and had a filling lunch.  Lots of tasty sauces on the wraps and sandwiches- fresh bread, great cuts of meat! Quick service. I would definitely go back- would be a great lunch to take to the park."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Deli in Cleveland and the customer service here is by far the best I have had."}
{"text":"Amazing! These guys have perfected these sandwiches with their own spin to them. They let you try a sample if you are a first timer. If I could give this place more than 5 stars i would."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and owners. Some of he best corned beef I've tasted. So glad I work just down the road and can keep this as a quick lunch option when I'm  deciding where to nosh for the day. The staff always makes you feel welcome and since the first time I visited I've been treated like a regular. I will definitely keep coming here and recommend that if you've not tried this place you should! Ya don't know what you're missing if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus this place is good! I'm often skeptical if a business only has glowing 5 star reviews, but this place is legit and their praise is well deserved!  Outside is nondescript, heck even the inside is nothing special, but oh do they make up for it in food and personality! The front is like a little convenience store and the back is where the deli counter is at. Just let them know you're new and they will quickly make up a little sampler platter for you and they make sure to explain what is on everything while they do it. You'll get some bits of shaved corned beef; turkey with house sauce (kind of like a creamy Italian dressing); pastrami with garlic sauce (amazing garlic sauce!), cheese, and thin pickles slices; and their famous reuben. I took my little sampling to a high top table and savored the gloriousness that was happening in my mouth.   While there the owner with his legit moustache made some friendly conversation with me. Right away you can tell that this guy is genuine good soul and passionate about his food. He was like \"you break bread here, you are like family now!\" \"I'm so honored to have you come and try our food\". He even called me sweetie, but in like in the nice old guy way, not the condescending creepy guy kind of way. He talked about how him and his wife are Lebanese and how they met in Michigan and went to Cleveland State, he spoke fondly of his son who wants to take over the family business, and what a smart family too! Degrees in business, math, engineering, (I forget what degrees, but they were definitely the kind the smart kids get).  I decided to go with the reuben $8. They make it on pita or white bread and boy this thing is huge! I also got a side of coleslaw $2. They let me sample some of their chicken and freshly made hummus too. The latter was warm and tasted amazing. Oh man, and they make reuben mac & cheese! They were out of it when I was there, but the owner was like \"you just call and I make it for you, no problem\". He said they usually have it in the colder months.   Shout out to the lady at the deli counter, she was personable too. Everyone who works at this place is family. I like it.   All in all, I highly recommend. Like forget Danny's Deli, forget Slyman's, go to Express Deli! Your belly is going to be so happy! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I have to say after reading all the rave reviews I had high expectations going in and was a bit disappointed. Express deli is a little place not far from the airport, inside you find a long store with the deli counter at the back.  The menu is straightforward, being a pescetarian, I had limited choices; in two visits I had the tuna wrap and a falafel wrap.  Service was friendly and fast.    The tuna wrap was a nice portion with cheese and vegies; decent but I found the tuna salad to be a bit watery, they needed to drain the tuna better.  The sandwich wasn't bad, but I would not order it again.  The falafel was better then the tuna, a nice wrap with tuna and hummus instead of tahini.  I do need to nitpick that the falafel balls were reheated in the microwave, which meant that the balls weren't as crisp as they could have been if they were fried fresh to order.   I also would have liked some tahini for the wrap as well.  Overall a good falafel, but not in my top 5 in Cleveland area.  I had heard that they offer new guests a 3 mini sandwich sampler; they did offer to do this for me, but when I explained that I didn't eat meat they said that they usually do it with meat.  They could have offered me some of the vegetarian options, but they did not.  If I ate meat I may have had a much better experience, but if you are looking for tuna or vegetarian options, they are available, but not exceptional."}
{"text":"Got take out for the office and two pounds of corned beef to take home on St. Patrick's day. The food was outstanding!  Best corned beef I've had in a long time!  The staff was not only accommodating but very friendly too. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant.  Been by it hundreds of times.  But never stopped till I read all the rave reviews.  I don't think I ever saw a place with all 5 stars.  They deserve it.  Great food and the friendliest service you will ever find.  Reuben sandwich and wrap were unbelievable."}
{"text":"Our office has ordered lunch here twice and the food is great! Their delivery is prompt, the food is fresh, and the employees are very helpful when we call w questions and when we place our orders. Prices are cheap too. Great place for lunch! It's better than any fast food around!!"}
{"text":"The plan was to add some pictures on here from our meal but we ate too fast...which should say a lot about this place. Especially after the owner teased us with a bunch of samples.   The bottom line is that a place like this actually cares a lot about what they do and it shows. From making you feel welcomed, to creative spins on the actual food, it's exactly what you hope for. I can't say enough about this place other than the fact that it just became a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"I went here on a trip to Cleveland, and it's definitely one of those \"best kept secret\" type places. The food is only matched by the incredibly nice service. They really do have just about the best and tastiest selection of deli options that I have ever had, absolutely delicious. Not to mention I was treated like a regular the first time I was there, as greeted with samples and recommendations. I have and will continue to make it a point to make multiple trips every time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after landing at Cleveland airport. Wanted something quick to eat so looked up yelp for deli places. This establishment came up so I decided to try it out. Upon arriving at this place, it does give off a gas station look. Walking inside the rectangular building, you can't help but feel a deli look to it. Drink frigs on both sides and a small counter in the rear.   I asked for a recommendation and immediately the lady asked if I was a first time customer. I said first time and then proceeded to make me a sampler platter of their famous subs which in this case is made in a pita. First was a turkey, pastrami and then their famous Rueben. All three samples were out of this world. I opted for the pastrami and cheese in a pita shell. It was delish. The amount and taste was perfect. I also got the seafood pasta.   I don't know when I'll be back but I'm counting down the days when it will happen. Stop on by this little deli. You won't be disappointment and the workers here are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Express Deli is hands down the BEST!  I have been coming here for ten years. The BLT wrap was always my favorite thing to get until I tried their rueben! If you are looking for flavor, this is the place you need to visit! I have introduced many of my friends to Express Deli, and I watched their eyes light up when they took their first bite of whatever wrap/sandwich they chose to eat.   You can get food at lunch time or even dinner time. Everyone who works here is so inviting and kind, you could never leave angry, or hungry."}
{"text":"The five stars is not by accident. This place came highly recommended from coworkers. I landed and sought this place out. I walked in and immediately felt like I was part of the family. They offered me samples for my first time experience, all were delicious, and then suggested the Reuben wrap. It did not disappoint. Go here!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely outstanding. The sandwiches that are made here are one of a kind. Pierre and his staff are very polite and always helpful.  You don't see many 5 star places on Yelp these days, but this place deserves everyone of them!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazeballs! The food is outstanding, and the service is makes you feel like you're at home!"}
{"text":"Just impeccable service and food. They went above and beyond with their customer service. Their pride in their food and their business is what every business should strive to be like. If that's not enough THE. FOOD. IS. AMAZING. Go get a workout at old school iron and then head there to smash a sandwich after. Very impressed."}
{"text":"I am from Memphis, TN, so while visiting on business I decided to see what all the fuss was about this place,,,and I can tell you it was the BEST Reuben I had in my life...he makes is sauce fresh from scratch every day..I tried to buy some, but he does not sell it. The owner and his son are so kind and friendly. Because I was undecided what I wanted to order, he let me sample until I found what I wanted...one of the best experience from a small business owner..would go back every time I come to OH.."}
{"text":"Wow!! After seeing reviews on yelp I decided to stop by with my wife for lunch.  Y'all were right!....so good, such a friendly and helpful family deli with great service and awesome food!   I'm pretty sure we will be trying every sandwich here! My wife had the ruben sandwich and I had the New York corned beef wrap!  Oh my....OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Favorite, favorite, favorite Pastrami wrap!  You have to try it with the extra garlic sauce/mayo.  I don't do deli nor do I eat any sandwich with a pickle on it BUT I actually CRAVE this wrap!  Owners are extremely nice and always thankful.  Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best reuben in my life. Very friendly owners. I read about the reviews on the yelp and i already decided to have a reuben sandwich. The lady owner still made me a bunch of samplers. I was already half full before even ordering. Every single one of the samplers was fantastic. I ended up getting a reuben wrap which was amazing. I would go again to try other sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is the best deli!! Very nice family owned deli and market. Wish they were in the Canton area.  I definitely recommend you visit you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Literally the best sandwiches ever.  I had the chicken gyro and my better half had the roast beef.  The sample sandwiches convinced me to order the Reuben next time.  The owner was so kind and friendly.  This place is a treasure.  We live an hour away and will come back for sure.  Its worth the trip!"}
{"text":"We asked Suri where to eat close to the airport and she sent us here. From the minute we walked in we were treated like royalty. I can't even think of enough adjectives to describe how amazing the food was. We made a special trip back before our return flight to get a Reuben wrap and it was more than worth it. Pierre and his family/team will make you feel right at home and make you a wrap/sandwich you won't forget. I couldn't recommend more highly."}
{"text":"Working in Cleveland and visiting from Arizona  I found my self looking for a place to have lunch  Checked yelp and came across this place  great food I would recommend this place to anyone  Owner was very nice and even gave me a free sample of the pastrami. If you around this place I would go check it out"}
{"text":"Super yummy food I love their originality! They put a refreshing spin on a typical corned beef sandwich! I loved that it was my first time and they gave me a sample of 3 different styles of sandwiches and also got to taste the corned beef by itself! Definitely a new lunch time favorite"}
{"text":"Pierre, Michael, and the rest of the family and staff are a joy to see every time I go into Express. The menu is fantastic (although I'm bias to the wraps and always get them). Highly recommend especially if you're looking for a quick, quality bite to eat."}
{"text":"I had just landed in Cleveland and was looking for a place to eat. Stopped by this place and was blown away with the kindness and customer service. Received samples as a first timer and had the best Rueben wrap I ever tasted. This is a must dine for sure."}
{"text":"Not that they needed another 5 star review but this place is so amazing! The owners are fantastic and treat you like family. The food is spot on. Hands down the best Reuben in Cleveland and that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"Best Corned Beef around! Pier and Tony are GREAT people! Blessed to have them in the community!"}
{"text":"Simply the best customer service out there.   Their wraps and sandwiches are great.   I have had most of them......I can't pick my favorite.   A must try."}
{"text":"Met the owner tonight what a great personality. Could have walked out of there full after trying some samples. Ended up getting a corn beef wrap which was well worth it. Highly recommend it if your in the Cleveland airport area."}
{"text":"Quite simply put, this is the best deli I have ever been to. Not only was the food full of flavor, the staff was beyond friendly. It was my first visit so they brought a sampling of their 4 most amazing meat choices and sandwiches. Well done Express Deli!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! You can drive by and miss this place but the wraps are amazing and so worth going out of your way. Turkey wrap with the house sauce is my favorite!"}
{"text":"It is astonishing to watch Mike work his magic at the counter. This is a one of a kind customer experience that showcases Express Deli's unique curations of cured meat comestibles.  The Reuben Wrap marries exquisite corned beef with the subtle tang of sauerkraut, the delicate sweetness of Russian dressing and precisely the right note of cheese, all lovingly tucked into a pita bread blanket and warmed to precisely the right temperature to create a chorus of flavor, texture and aroma unequalled in the annals of takeout.  You may have eaten Reuben sandwiches. Until Mike and his crew caress your senses with their crowning corned beef achievement, you are comparing cave paintings with Monet's water lilies, mosh pit slam dancing with the Joffrey ballet, and Honey Boo Boo with Lauren Bacall."}
{"text":"The first time I came here. Service was amazing. The sandwich maker at the deli offered me some samples to help me decide which to choose. I had chosen their Rueben wrap which apparently is their best seller.. The cashier was very nice too. Not too many delis and corner stores that give you that feeling of welcome. Reminds me of the good old deli/store where the employees have passion in making great sandwiches and go out of their way to make customers happy."}
{"text":"From out of town - found this place on yelp. Some of the most friendly people I've ever met and the food is excellent! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So amazing it compelled me to write my first Yelp review. Amazing service and food! Worth everything penny. Support this local business. I'm from CA and we have nothing like this!!!"}
{"text":"My company moved locations recently and I depended on Yelp to find a new place for lunch.  Express Deli was the closest place and we decided to try it one day.  We have been back several times and have made it a weekly Friday tradition.  The Rueben wrap is to die for and the overall atmosphere of the place really adds to the experience.   I try to refer them new customers whenever the opportunity arises because they deserve it.  They have earned a lifelong customer right here!"}
{"text":"I needed something quick that I could take to the airport with me and thank goodness for Help, or I'd have never stopped at this amazing place. The service was outstanding and the food is heavenly."}
{"text":"The express deli is such an amazing place. The service is amazing and the owner, Pierre, is the nicest person. I live very far away, and I have gone there three times! Every time I come to Ohio, I feel an irresistible urge to stop and get a veggie Reuben. Speaking of the veggie Reuben, the food is amazing! They've definitely got something special, from the awesome hummus to the perfect pita. Most of my family is vegetarian, and their vegetarian options are amazing! The falafel is just right in every way, and the veggie Reuben is unlike anything else that I've ever tasted. Overall, it's the most amazing place, with the most amazing food, and I have no idea why anyone would dislike it. The food is great and the service is great. I hope I come to Ohio again soon, if not for family, for this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches! You have to try the wraps! Excellent customer service! When I went there I was asked if I have a few moments and the owner made me two small tastes of meat and bread to share what other selections they have. They also have chips, drinks and beer available."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing but the staff is very nice. We got the Ruben wrapped and it was amazing."}
{"text":"I travel quite a bit for work and love to find great places while on the road... Today I was in the Cleveland area looking for a deli to get a sandwich .... And found (insert angels choir music here) Express Deli!! First - when we walked in, the lovely women behind the counter were fresh slicing homemade corned beef and gave us a few slices to try - delicious!  Then they put some homemade pastrami on a little piece of bread with a homemade garlic spread and a paper thin slices piece of pickle and I fell in love!! I am sitting here in my hotel eating this sandwich and I can honestly say - you MUST come here and get one of these!! Hands down - The. Best. pastrami I have ever had the pleasure of eating - I will be back any time I finds myself in town!!!! Keep up the amazing work Express Deli!!"}
{"text":"I love the turkey wrap. I give this place 5 stars because of the owners, they always make me feel welcome when im there. If you want extras, it's never a problem. They are great people with good food, I will always be a cutomer here. Have them cater a lunch for you some time, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One word.  Amazing.  Located in a very small strip plaza on Smith Rd near Brookpark.  When I saw the glowing reviews I thought it was a joke.  This place is very small.  But it's no joke.  When I walk in I am greeted by a gentleman behind a counter with an interesting moustache and a smile.  He is extremely nice and very genuine.  I sat and ate my lunch at one of the 4 tables close to the door (that's all that's in the place).  He knew more than half of the customers that were checking out by name.  Asking how their mom is doing among other personal details.  I could see why because when I checked out he struck up a conversation.  It's hard not to talk with him.  He is very genuine and easy to talk to.  He asked me if it was my first time in.  I said yes.  He told me to go to the counter in the back and they would take care of me.  A much younger version of the moustache gentleman (with a beard) made me a sandwich sampler.  So I know what to try on the menu.  Apparently, that's what they do for first timers.  They are known for the their wraps over bread or hoagies.  And their prize sandwich is the reuben wrap.  They explain that is their baby and what they are most proud of.  They make the corned beef from scratch in house.  With aged house made kraut.  And all the sauces on their sandwiches are house made.  The flavors that are layered in the reuben make it one of the best I've had anywhere.  Tender pita for the wrap.  Tender and flavorful corned beef.  The tangy kraut with a savory crunch.  Mixed in with smooth and tasty 1000 island dressing.    Their business is based on superior customer service.  Spending extra time and care to get to know their customers.  Spending extra time and care to create some of the best food in a sandwich I've ever had.  It shows.  Easily worth the 5 stars they get here.  Well deserved.  I can't wait to order their catering so I can share this place with others in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in while on a business trip.  Excellent Rueben Wrap and very friendly staff!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had to try it due to the reviews.   I can't believe I haven't heard of it before.  Amazazing. Must try every sandwich. Try the sample.  I'll be back alot"}
{"text":"Food top notch. My BLT wrap with egg had the perfect balance of bacon, veggies, mayo and whatever special sauce is in there. Lady behind the counter made sure I was satisfied with what she was putting in my sandwich. Pierre makes the experience there the best. It's like going to an old friend's house in the neighborhood.  He took the time to chat to get to know me and my son.  This was the first time for me there, so I'm sure he treats everyone like this. This will be a great place to go to before departing or after arriving from the airport or if I'm just in the area. The 5 star review this place gets is as accurate as you can get on a review forum."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good sandwich spot near the Cleveland airport. This place has 5 stars for a reason. Their hospitality is second to none. Let them know you've  never been there and they'll give you a sample taste of what they offer.  They have one of the most flavorful Rueben sandwiches I've ever had. Don't drive by!"}
