{"text":"Bland food, terrible atmosphere, front staff are unfriendly and even less knowledgeable about what they are serving. They charge for a small amount of peppers and onions (and other toppings) on the sandwiches which they neglect to tell about or advertise very well. Didn't even consider pizza as it looked sad and grey. This is a poor example of Italian cooking in a town full of Italian eateries."}
{"text":"I ordered from here Saturday night for myself and the family, a simple Margarita Pizza and for the adults, Diavola. The staff and chef were extremely nice, gave me some recommendations for hot peppers and even gave me some homemade hot pepper oil to take home to try out. The pizza was fantastic and I will 100% be back to give everything a try."}
{"text":"High quality pizza. Thin crust. Home made sauce. Hand tossed and delicious. Fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection. You have got to try their pizza. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Ok.. So I got a whole pizza. The pizza comes naturally with a thin crust. Its quite delicious.

The place SERIOUSLY needs to be redone though."}
