{"text":"A good place. The bar is always clean and they have entertainment regularly. The owner clearly has pride in his establishment. Bartenders can be distant; they don't project an inviting atmosphere.  The music is either from the jukebox or, on weekend nights, the Dj. Song selection is common club mixes. Dance floor is not heavily populated because it is in a separate part not viewable from the main bar.   The crowd is mostly thirty plus guys. People are dressed well in the sense that they are attempting to project status. Definitely more trendy types but it is possible to find friendly people."}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland for the Gay Games and Twist was near my hotel in Lakewood. It seemed to have a fairly laid back vibe, a place you would want to pre-game at or drink and socialize with a group of friends. It didn't appear that many strangers were mingling with others but perhaps I was wrong.   I did like the space; simple, straight forward room with a rectangular bar, tv's and music. The bartenders weren't necessarily friendly but not rude by any means. Overall though I would visit this place again if I was in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I\"ve been here twice since I moved to Lakewood and I've had a good time both times.  Everyone seems really riendly, but I do see cliques walking around, which is kind of lame.  Not enough lesbians for my taste, but that's just me.   Drinks are ok, it's \"hag friendly\", and I even met a famous Cleveland criminal there.  One of my favortie memories of moving to the West Side.  However, I've only been here 4 months, so I'm sure that will change"}
{"text":"The crowd at this bar is generally older and likes to \"stand and model\".  They are very disdainful and people here trying to convince others they are omnipotent.  The bar tenders would rather cater to their friends and hand out a beer or glass of wine then take the time to make a mixed drink for a customer since this takes too much time.  I am an executive from Brecksville, Ohio and have taken my clients from NYC and LA to this bar.   We got there on a Friday night and had to wait in line for about 20 minutes for several martini's only to have the drinks taste very bitter and over-poured in the glass dripping on the bar.   I have gone to this bar in the past and was told to walk to the downstairs bar where they have more time to make mixed drinks.  I was told by a bartender named Keith at the top bar they are too busy.   I stopped spending my $200.00 per night that I would have spent on mixed drinks at this bar, and traveled to The Cleveland Warehouse District to a straight establishment where they cater to upscale clients that appreciate my  business, thus spending my money happily elsewhere.   This bar has really gone down hill in the recent years and cannot cater to upscale clients that are willing to spend their  money here.   Since the bartenders have so much \"attitude\" and are unwilling to cater to the upscale clients that patronage this establishment I have told my gay hairdresser in Lakewood about the incident and he has managed to rely the message to his gay clients within the community.   We joke about this place every time I get my hair cut and talk about how this establishment has really gone down over the years and are really shocked it is still open? (they have a banner on their building now catering to Drag Queens so they are really grabbing at revenue here).  I have even tried to talk with the owner John about the customer service issue and he just blows you off as all the bartenders are his personal friends and he could care less about customer service and taking constructive criticism in order to better his business model.  I will not go to this place and spend a cent here every again,  as word has gotten out in the Cleveland gay community that people feel that same way about his establishment."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar located in Cleveland. The space has been recently renovated with a great copper top bar and exposed brick walls. We were there Thanksgiving weekend so the only downfall I felt was it wasn't that busy. The drinks are affordable and our bartender Steve poured a great drink. Great place to listen to the local top 40 and talk and catch up with your friends."}
{"text":"Wanna get tipsy?  Order anything that requires them to pour it from a bottle.  Seriously the bartenders are very generous with the liquor.    I love Twist any night of the week, but Thursdays are fun because of Margarita nights.  Fridays and Saturdays this seems to be the place people meet up before heading off to another bar so I'd come sorta earlier in the evening."}
{"text":"Twist is a clean place with a nice patio in the front.  The garage doors on the front open up on nice days.  The crowd is usually well dressed and a tad on the snobby side.  Mostly thirty and forty somethings who prance around wearing scarfs holding martinis.  This is a great place to take a few friends and sit on the front patio on a warm night.  The only problem is...this is the only bar I've ever gotten sober in.  Ordering a drink is like putting it on lay-away...you might have it by Christmas.  I actually order two beers at a time because the service is so painfully slow.  The bartenders are nice, but prompt service doesn't seem to be a priority.  I wouldn't suggest going to twist alone looking to meet someone .  Talking to some of the patrons is like talking to a houseplant.  Take a friend with you...and a cooler full of beer."}
{"text":"I've been here several times during trips to visit friends in Cleveland.   It's a pretty basic bar with a friendly staff, though they could use an extra bartender to help out. The decor is modern and it's accompanied by a pool table that is usually occupied. They also have a nice outdoor section that's separates the bar from the sidewalk. Drink prices aren't bad and they definitely hook you up.   Memorable? No. But worth stopping by for a drink or two."}
{"text":"As others have said, this seems to be a good place to grab a drink or two earlier in the evening and move on. The drinks are definitely strong and it's nice to be able to drink on the patio. The crowd is a bit older than what I was expecting, but I guess that's because it's more bar/lounge than show bar. The dancing room, or whatever you'd like to call it seems a little small and out of place, but if you want to get up and shake it, you have that option."}
{"text":"this is a place to pre-game.  better in the summer time with the nicer weather so you can comfortably go outside with your cocktail.  sundays have a make your own bloody mary bar for $3 a drink.   i dont mind this place, but i wouldnt spend all night there.  good for a place to swing by for a while, and be on your way."}
{"text":"Twist Social Club is the same pox today as it has been since Day 1. The original owner set the bar, and substandard customer relations is his legacy. Not only are bartenders and management uppity primadonnas who put themselves on a pedestal high above the customers, but they pour a stingy, watered-down drink. Even with the ice in the glass at snowcone levels, the contents never reach anywhere near the rim--which might be a good thing on the frequent occasions when they serve a concoction that isn't even in the range of what your ordered.  There's absolutely no employee accountability required, as evidenced when they falsely reported the consumer complaint I posted to Facebook as containing nudity. Even if I had posted a photo, I never post nudity online. Next time you consider Twist, go to an AA meeting instead. Even if you're not an alcoholic, you'll have a more fun, productive time and you might actually meet someone."}
{"text":"4 stars because the drinks are good and everyone I met there was amazing!!! So friendly and funny! Went on a Thursday so not sure what the weekend scene looks like but I really enjoyed my time!"}
{"text":"Definitely for the trendy and cute crowd. Bartenders are not very friendly if you are not young or pretty. The hot summer spot for queens in C-Town."}
{"text":"Strong cheap drinks. it's a small bar with a little dancefloor beside it. We always started our nights here. it's a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very expensive drinks--we paid $32 for 5 coronas. Also, the bartenders were uninviting and continued to change the music to horrible songs. What the hell."}
