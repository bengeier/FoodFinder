{"text":"If your a woman you will get harassed by a local who sits at the edge of the bar.  I thought it was a one time deal but saw it week after week.  I assuming he knows the owner or is the owner.  It's too bad otherwise a nice bar.   He is just a bully needs to punched in the mouth but I would assume he would sue you.  One of those guys."}
{"text":"Bad service and unfriendly staff. Everyone looks like working there has made them bitter, fat and angry. The food is not good; NEVER ORDER THE FRIES! The crowd there  is so-so at best, usually on the trashy side. Guard your wallet or purse. Heavy smoking crowd as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I literally just walked out of this place after being there for a short maybe 3 minutes. The bartender was extremely unpleasant, clearly didn't know how to engage in conversation and had an attitude when I asked her if she could put on the Heat vs. Raptors game. It was evident she whispered something about us to another server as she immediately looked over at us. My husband wasn't even asked what he would like to drink and when he acknowledged the bartender for putting the game on she basically ignored him  and was completely expressionless. We refuse to spend our money at an establishment like this. Its no wonder the parking lot was pretty much empty! On to someplace else....thank goodness!"}
{"text":"The food is good but very very slow. I've been here a few times hoping that it was just a one time thing. Nope. Your order gets taken and then you wait. And wait. And wait. Once your food finally arrives, it's good."}
{"text":"Went with some friends for lunch, had the B.L.T and was pretty good.  The service however needs some work, slow and not very attentive."}
{"text":"last time I went here the bartender was more worried about giving his friends shots, eating his food and drinking coffee than to take my order.  when he finally realized me standing there with my money in my hand five minutes later he acted as if i inconvienced him.  Gave him a two dollar tip on a drink, went back up to bar the second time he didn't notice me again, and i got his attention by saying \"hey man i just need an empty glass\" then he walk past me and the empty glasses across from me takes a dudes order who just walked up and grabs a glass after helping him so he oviously heard me."}
{"text":"45 minutes to receive order on a not too busy day, BOTH meals incorrect, told the waitperson not to bother fixing, hit Arby's drive through instead. Surprisingly bad experience. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is a lot smaller than it looks on the outside, basically a square building and straight row for the bar area. With that said, they offer karaoke nights and really generous birthday specials (free drinks all night in their complimentary glass! See my photo for the full detail). The bartenders were nice enough, the ambiance is a bit divey, and they tended to go heavy on country while we were there."}
{"text":"Found this little gem from a co-worker we were sending off. I have to say that this place is awesome for watching a game of any kind. TV's galore! This is a quaint little place right on Monona Drive and frankly there isn't really anything bad to say about it. The drinks are well priced, the food is pretty dang good, and the staff is friendly and attentive. 

Two small qualms, the door leading to their outdoor smoking/patio area is obnoxious. We were trying to watch a basketball game and it seemed like every 5 minutes that dang door was slamming like a jet fighter flying by over the speed of sound. AND I was told the Boom Boom sauce was hotter than tobasco sauce NOT EVEN close haha but that is really nothing to scour at. Once again, a nice little place to enjoy a good meal, couple beers, and whatever game is on."}
{"text":"Great staff.  Great happy hour.  Great food.  I would recommended the Boom Boom Wings, any burger or the club sandwich.  Happy Hour is 2-for-1's.  I also think it runs 3-7.  Lots of TV's too"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out but unfortunately there is s thing named Lou who patrons the bar and has no problem harassing and putting his hands on women. If management would rid of this bar vermin it would be an even better place to hang out."}
{"text":"A Madison sports bar staple for over 20 years. I like the specials they have daily. Birthdays you drink free and get a glass mug. Great place to watch sports and have get togethers with friends. Simple menu with bar and grill classics. I love their triple decker club and their new prime rib salad. Both are cheap, large portion, tasty and simple. Had both twice now and it's been consistently good. Wait times can be long when it's busy I find. Expect 25-30 mins when local teams are playing. 

Seems to be a regular place for my family to go when relatives have birthdays so I come along every time when the name comes up and I happen to be in town."}
{"text":"You never want to be \"those\" people who show up on a Sunday about 5 minutes before the kitchen closes and there's only one person in the joint and they might be the bartenders boyfriend...and yet... we were. It's my Husband's birthday and they give you a complimentary burger and beers to celebrate another turn around the sun. Sweet deal! Delicious burger! Friendly staff...even if you're the last at the last minute on a Sunday. 

We're looking forward to going back! Nice place with great friendly faces behind the bar!"}
{"text":"Was lured here on my birthday by their offer of complimentary burger and drink on that special day. Enjoyed burger which came with very good fries.Domestic tap beer and rail drinks included [not wine..] Service was attentive. All in all an above average bar and grill."}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast: website says the bar opens at 8am.  Actually opens at 9am on Sunday. The service is terrible. But the bloody bar is fun and they have really good burgers."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time on Friday, July 18.  Wow, what a disappointment.  I had the \"Monona Cheese Steak,\" which is marked on the menu as a house specialty.  The bun was unremarkable, and there was nothing identifiable as cheese - there was some type of cheese sauce that more closely resembled dressing than cheese.  Worst of all was the meat - riddled with gelatinous fat.  Steak sandwiches are supposed to be lean!  Disgusting.  I wasn't expecting Philly quality, but this was gross.

My girlfriend had the fried shrimp (it was fish fry night), and her reaction:  \"Meh.\"

We believe in second chances and may be back again someday, but it won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been to the Silver Eagle a few times over the years and it has always been a pretty decent experience. The food is decent but the drinks are always good. Their prices are reasonable as well. It is a very casual environment and the service is always good."}
{"text":"The food is ok...but the service is just bad. Either you get a woman squeezed into a junior high schooler's shirt who would rather be somewhere else OR you get a super hyper guy who thinks asking 40 questions about how your day is going is deemed good service....how about just not disappearing for 25 minutes when I need a refill?"}
{"text":"I eat there every other week if not more often.  Service has been great and one of the best club sandwichs in town.  A lot of tv's to watch the games.  Friends like the burgers, but I always stick with the club.  Surprising a decent beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Called ahead to confirm karaoke was happening, they said yes it starts at 9pm. Arrive at 9:30pm, no karaoke. Ordered our first round of drinks. Karaoke DJ says he is waiting for the manager to tell him to start. The waitresses said he could start whenever he wanted.

When I finished my drink still no one had made an effort to say \"hey, customers are leaving because karaoke isn't happening\"...

10:30pm, still no karaoke.

We drove 30 minutes to go to this place that we called ahead to and they didn't care, even when I mentioned it.

Don't recommend this place for anyone who is looking for karaoke."}
{"text":"A girlfriend that lives in the area brought us here for a very early Sunday funday and breakfast. 

They have a GREAT Bloody Mary bar (lots of options) and cheap food. Perfect for a hangover. :)"}
{"text":"Decent place, friendly bartenders. Lots of options for tap beers and amazing cider beer on tap. Yum! Bloody Mary's were great too and can't wait to get back for the Bloody Mary bar. Overall, good place and well be back. Younger crowd. Close to home. :)"}
{"text":"Perfectly nice place with good food (burgers are charbroiled) and very attentive staff. Lots of windows for looking out at part of the Aldo Leopold/wooded area across the way."}
{"text":"Well, dang... my experience at my most recent visit to the Eagle left me with a bad taste. The male bartender was just not friendly, at all. Not one smile did he crack. I got the Eagle burger, and it was just blah. This is a major contrast from the beautiful gut bomb I had the last time I went here. The fries were waaay too salty, to the point of being inedible. I did use my VIP card, which is cool... hey, VIP! While my friend and I had Hopalicious pints, most of the drinks served while we were at the bar were Bomb shots (these people were going in HARD)--including one that was a shot of Jameson AND a shot of Jaeger with Red Bull (WHY MUST YOU ABUSE JAMESON IN THIS MANNER!?). Finally, the majority of the crowd there kept going out to the smoking area, propping the door open and letting in gusts of Arctic air and NASTY cigarette smoke. This pretty much ruined my and my companion's evening; we were sitting right by that door. When I told one of them to shut the door, please, I got a dirty look. The staff did nothing about this.

Eh. Maybe if the Silver Eagle hired some real professionals to staff their tavern and wrangle their regulars, things would improve. As for now, I'm thinking I won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Love this bar!! I'm surprised I have never reviewed this place because I have been coming here for almost 10 years! My husband gets the Silver Eagle   Burger every we come and I typically get the chicken wrap with grilled chicken. Endless fries are always available. For your birthday you get a free meal and drink for free from a mug that you get to keep. It can be hard to get a table when it is busy, especially during any Badger or Packer game but even when it gets really busy, the staff do a great job of getting you food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I've been to Silver Eagle to eat several times and have yet to be disappointed. They have solid food that is reasonably priced. Their fish fry is good. I had the walleye and really enjoyed it.

They also do a good job with breakfast. It's nothing fancy, but it tastes good and is cheap. I usually go with the scrambler. They also have a bloody mary bar on the weekends."}
