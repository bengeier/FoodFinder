{"text":"I'm on a streak of bad restaurants.  Knowing this is not the good place I came with some friends.  We've ordered several items.  We had a little episode while ordering a three colour rice, my friend wants to have a fried egg instead of the egg cake.  The response we have is \"No\", we start laughing and ask how hard to make an fried egg then the waitress said to add a dollar.    First came the spring roll, temperature is good and taste is descent.  Then my friend's large special beef noodle came, the size would be just a medium at other places.  Then came the ketchup noodle which is ok.  I also ordered a three colour rice, the portions of each item are very small but that's ok, here I put some shredded pork skin in my month, it was cold and when I tried the egg, it was so hard that I couldn't eat.  The pork chop is just ok.  I couldn't eat any of it!!!!!!    One of the kid wants a ovaltine, they don't have it either !!!!! At this point we all start laughing at this restaurant.    On a Sunday lunch which the restaurant is not even half full I should have known better."}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service  This is the first time I've been here since Top Saigon was renamed to First Choice. They changed the boss as well it seems, cause I used to know the owners of Top Saigon, who presumably have now focused their efforts on the North York branch.  I came here for their tea time special, and they have quite a few options. I had the well-done beef brisket noodle soup, with an additional $1 charge to change to tomato soup base as I wanted to compare this place with Top Saigon, to see if anything changed.  The meal was overall okay. The soup base was a bit more sour compared to before, but certainly less oily. The beef briskets were cooked decently. However, the noodles were either of low quality or were simply not cooked enough, because they did not have the smooth and silky taste you're normally accustomed to in most Vietnamese restaurants.  Service was good, and they do have free wifi. Overall I wouldn't rush to come back here, but for what it is it's not bad at all."}
{"text":"2.5 Star for food + 0.5 Star for service  First Choice has so so lunch special but basically it is just similar pricing as regular menu but includes a choice of drink.  There are 3 items to choose from which is different every weekday. And for Thursday I decided to have Beef Satay Noodle Soup ($7.95).  My noodle was ok. The soup based though overwhelming strong and rich. The beef was lean but way overcooked.  Service though was really friendly and attentive! I was offered an extra napkin by my waitress without requesting when she saw that I probably need one!  First Choice though won't be the the first choice for me if I have craving for Vietnamese food but it is decent if you are in the area."}
