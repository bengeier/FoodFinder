{"text":"I love this place, the food is good, service is great and they are super nice. The place is small but not stuffy. The menu has a variety of items to choose from and everything i have tried has been good so far. 

Build your own burger and build your own breakfast are amazing!! You basically get to customize your own meal with those 2 choices

I like how they are located away from all the tourist attractions so it isnt full of party-goers. It is near the famous pawn shop."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food with some flavorful twists. The Nuthouse sandwich and Sunni Southwestern salad are wonderful. Lots of good choices!"}
{"text":"This place was a great find!! It was a couple of blocks to walk there from The D Hotel on Fremont Street. The food was top quality and good sized portions. The owner was taking orders and visiting with customers. The restaurant has a great history for a veteran who lost his life in Afghanistan. Any patriotic American can enjoy the story and support the efforts of the new owner to continue to honor his legacy. Hands down one of the best breakfast stops in Las Vegas and it is VERY affordable!"}
{"text":"Great lunch place during work week. Office is right down the street so super convenient for me. Love the Bubba! Oh yeah, and garlic fries!"}
{"text":"We walked in at 10 AM and it was empty, which made us nervous. My wife asked for
decaf and milk, and they had neither,  which made us MORE nervous. Well, very very glad we stayed.  We enjoyed an excellent breakfast at reasonable prices, with good service and a nice talk with a very cheerful owner.  Home run!"}
{"text":"Dougie J's - a tasteful tribute to a fallen soldier and all those who serve and have served. This brand-new, family-run cafe exudes a warmth and friendliness that you can feel with their sincere and attentive service. I enjoyed my fresh, hot coffee and build-your-own breakfast sandwich: eggs, bacon, pepper jack & avocado on sourdough w/side of home fries. Can't go wrong with a classic, affordable, American breakfast- in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Awesome cafe, great breakfast! Stop by and give them a try.  The owner is great and makes you feel very welcome here!!"}
{"text":"Super awesome!! I've been here now 3 times for breakfast & for lunch. The food is really good & also great atmosphere with great service! The owner is so sweet she even came over to talk to us. It's become our new hang out. Love love!!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the atmosphere is great, and the staff are very friendly. I've had both lunch and dinner at Doughie J's and been impressed with both. Last time I stopped in for lunch, they even offered our party freshly baked (and very delicious!) chocolate chip cookies for free. I will be back to Doughie J's again for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff n of course this was the best breakfast I have had in Vegas!!! My hubby had the Home Fries Bacon n eggs enormous size toast. I had the French Toast n Bacon huge serving, just remember u will order a second helping of that Apple Smoked Bacon!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! The restaurant has a great atmosphere! Food was excellent. Service was fast! I would highly recommend. The owner cane out and talked with us for a while. Very friendly!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful, but it is the owner who is the real star here. She is so warm and welcoming! 
When I asked for decaf coffee, the waitress informed me that they were out. A few minutes later though, here comes the owner with a nice hot cup of decaf coffee, that she made up just for me. Talk about hospitality! 
I will be coming back here again and again!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food.

Went here the morning of Feb 29, 2016. We explained to the staff that we had a flight to catch and a dine-in only groupon left. 

The staff was so kind and helpful towards our situation and the food was amazing! I love burgers and this was the best burger I had during my Vegas visit. 

The location is about a ten minute walk from downtown Fremont and it was nice to go to a bit more of a quiet area during our stay. 

If you love burgers and fries, I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and the staff was very gracious and kind! They were able to give me a trio of pancakes; I got their famous blueberry pancakes, a banana pancake-which is AMAZING- and a chocolate chip to top it off. Best. Decision. Ever! I recommend everyone to stop by and try it at least once. I'll definitely be coming back more frequently!"}
{"text":"Yumtown. This was a surprise. Quiet, dark, and relatively empty. The food was delicious (philly), the service was friendly and prompt, and the turn around was fast. I will be returning shortly."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. What a great cause. Go support the soldiers with an amazing meal and the best espresso we have ever had!! All employees are veterans too"}
{"text":"I love the decor, the food is delicious, friendly service. My new place to visit each time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place after seeing 4/5 stars on Yelp.  We placed a delivery order and about an hour later (which, hey, that happens it's lunch hour and busy) our order for three arrived in a 1/2 filled shopping size bag.  At first I thought they had forgotten some items, but no, that was the whole order.  We did 1/2 portions for The Dougie Sandwich, The B Salad, and The Sunni Southwest Salad.  

The B Salad menu price was $8.00, though only a 1/2 portion you would expect a lot more to an $8.00 salad.  They described the salads as \"rubbery chicken\" with that thin watery-style ranch.  I had The Dougie Sandwich, menu price *only* $8.00 (1/2 portion).  This turned out to be just a few inches of basic roll with cold bland brisket, though the sweet potato chips were decent enough.  Overall the consensus was this was very disappointing and overpriced.  

Maybe they treat customers better in the cafe vs. delivery orders, or maybe it was a bad day?  I don't know, but this is my honest review of Dougie J's Cafe.  The delivery driver mentioned they had great American style decorations, guess I will never know since I wont be back.

I uploaded a few pictures, you can judge for yourself if these are worth $8.00 before tax, delivery fee, and tip (comes out to about $11.00 each then).  At least it should have tasted good for the price..."}
{"text":"Pancakes are amazing fresh blueberries, staff is friendly. This please really has a very homey feel doesn't get much better then this...especially when you consider it's right on the corner of Bonneville and Las Vegas Blvd"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious. A plus they offer turkey bacon.  Portions are huge, enough to share.  Service and atmosphere was friendly.  Definitely would return!"}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love this place!! Suni The owner is amazing! She opened Dougie J's in honor of her son that was KIA defending our freedoms! Love the decor! Food is great! I'm sold on the chicken soup. I didn't get a pic cause I ate it so fast! They also deliver to the area for all u downtown workers! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I'm a fan.  I've passed by here so many times and never noticed it!!  They definitely need better signage.  At any rate the burgers are fantastic: deftly seasoned, nicely topped, great bread choices...yasss!  The service is competent--friendly and average.  The only real disappointment was the garlic fries...they're wimpy and limpy shoestring style :(  Owners...think garlic steak fries!!!  that'd be outta this world.  Despite this, I will be bahck!!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and service.  I had the granola pancakes and they were de-lish!!!"}
{"text":"We got there at opening and there was only one other table and it took more then a half hour to get our food which was very bland and cold. Do not recommend the huevos rancheros... Chili sauce was a mysterious color and no flavor."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem!! The food is incredible and the owner is a sweetheart. She has a great back story of why she opened the restaurant and appreciates meeting everyone that walks in. It's a little far from the main strip but downtown Vegas is worth the trip. It's next to the Pawn Stars shop and a short walk to downtown. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Great place and great people. Wonderful location with really good food!  Will be back again soon!!"}
{"text":"Very great hole in the wall place for breakfast or lunch,  families, dates, anything really. It's perfect. Very well priced and veteran owned with beautifully decorated walls with military memorabilia, suits, and pictures. The staff including Dougie J himself are amazing. They accept any coupons and promotions as well which makes the cherry on top. Must try! Support our troops!"}
{"text":"Funky place with pleasant service and wholesome food. The Huevos Rancheros which we both had, were good but not prepared in the traditional manner. Overall, to be recommended."}
{"text":"A must try in downtown vegas.  Suni and the rest of the staff so nice!!   Food is delicious.  
Make sure you pay to park!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! Super quaint and quiet. Food was delicious! Staff was friendly and very  reasonably priced!! I loved the decor!"}
{"text":"Great food. Our one meal feed both my son and I due to the large portions. Great deal on Groupon too."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since they opened and I'm glad I choose it for lunch today. The wait staff was very warm and friendly. I had the beef burger w/ sweet potato fries my friend had the Dougie. We ordered the tomato soup just because I can always enjoy a cup of creamy tomato soup. I wasn't a fan of the soup it was average but the burger and fries were delicious! I have to say the same for the Dougie since my friend didn't leave anything on her plate either. This place will be a regular lunch spot."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Groupon and it was really close to our hotel, so we stopped for breakfast on our way out of town. Husband LOVED the tater tots! I enjoyed my pancake, eggs, and bacon breakfast as well. The place is small, but service was extremely fast and friendly and a great value. I loved all the support the show the military, too."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service! The food was great, I had a chicken philly I only ate half! So very stuffed breakfast for me and the tots were made just how I LOVE them, crispy! Definitely will be coming back real soon since they said they're going to add new things to the menu, can't wait! Everything in their menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"The best country fried steak and eggs I've ever had. Gravy was savoury, eggs were cooked to perfection.

Service was quick and very warm and friendly. I stumbled upon this place during my visit and I will 100% return in my next Vegas visit 

My new favorite breakfast joint in the area"}
{"text":"They open at 9am and we were seated.  We ordered basic breakfasts of eggs and bacon.......45 minutes later it arrived.  Mediocre at best and with the wait, unacceptable.

A party of 7 walked in as we were still waiting, they engaged us and we told them about our experience and they walked out.  My wife's food was cold and undercooked....really, after 45 minutes you can't cook an egg?

Again, we are the only people in the whole place and grandpa had to repeatedly ask for coffee.

Never again, however the decor was great with all the old military gear."}
{"text":"Great little place to get lunch down here on Bonneville. 
The place is a tribute to a fallen soldier so if you're into supporting the troops it's a good place to support too.
Good food and good prices, I like the philly."}
{"text":"Nothing less than a perfect cafe. It was peaceful and welcoming environment. The service was great and very comforting and the menu selection was very broad! The food itself is nothing less than amazing. The coffee was perfect diner coffee. My friend and I both ordered a full sandwich, swapped halves and couldn't even finish it because there was a lot of food - well worth the price and absolutely delicious. Highly recommend! (I got the nuthouse sandwich, TRY IT)."}
{"text":"This amazing little diner has a new owner  so if you have been here before things may have changed.  It is a breakfast and lunch diner with an all American decor and menu..  Good basic, fresh food.  We went on a Friday morning for breakfast.  He ordered a 3 egg meal that came with 2 sausage patties, tater tots, (very tasty) and toast.  My French Toast was accompanied by 2 pieces of thick bacon.  Both very satisfying. We will surely return, maybe for one of the many lunch choices.

The new owners name is Ralph.  He sort of rescued this restaurant and is determined to make a success. He is a Veteran and it seems like his goal is to enhance the lives of other Veterans any way he can.  I think it's important to support all Military business and Veterans.  If you agree, stop by and say hi to Ralph. He's one of the good guys."}
{"text":"Decent small scale local diner.  Not the greatest food, but worthy option if you want cheap food and want to support the local economy."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast the food was good and the owner and workers were super nice and sociable. Great prices and it's owned by veterans and hopes to honor veterans. I will definately come back."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Had the Philly and Chicken Philly and both were very flavorful.  FAST service.  Very friendly.  If you are by this pet of town worth stopping by."}
{"text":"First time at this place and I have to say this place is great. We had two large breakfasts and food came out within 5min  I'm giving it a five star due to Ralph the server he was awesome. So welcoming and made sure we had everything and checked numerous times. Decor is military cool something you don't see that much off especially in Vegas"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. I got the Nutella and banana french toast (The Ritz) and it was absolutely delicious! However the turkey bacon it came with was WAY overcooked and basically disintegrated when I tried to eat it. Gross. My boyfriend got the huevos rancheros, which I really enjoyed, but he thought the tortillas were annoyingly crispy. Though crispy, I did think all the flavors were wonderful (i didnt mind the crunch at all). My complaint is mostly the atmosphere - the restaurant is very small and so I could hear the conversations at every table clearly. Noise echos in there a lot and there isnt a lot of decor to absorb the sound."}
{"text":"This place is great! We stopped in for some brunch in our last day in Vegas and I wish we had found it sooner. 
This place is a bit of a hole in the wall, but a great find. Their chicken fried steak is so tender it basically melts in your mouth, they serve coffee and it's run by veterans. I wish we had a place like this back home! Amazing amazing amazing."}
{"text":"Maybe we came too close to closing, came in at ten after two pm (they close at three). I was really quite underwhelmed. I had the sweet potato and chorizo hash which consists of sweet potato French fries and ground up chorizo meat. The flavor was actually good and the flavors worked well together. With that said they could do so much more with this dish. Use chopped sweet potatoes, put onions and bell peppers in there make it a hash and not just meat sauce over fries. My wife had the nuthouse was good but was too dry. The meat and the bread were dry but again the flavor was good. My son had a burger which was all good! Good meat and great pretzel bun. 

The service was great!! However I don't know that I would be back after the quality of food versus the price."}
{"text":"This place is a solid little diner for breakfast and lunch. They have a good variety of food items to choose from and even allow you to build your own scrabble with a HUGE list of items to add for breakfast, and a build your own sandwich for lunchtime. 

My friends and I were immediately greeted by a server when we walked into the place and noticed that everything was advertised as fresh and made to order. With this, it can add a longer wait time when it comes to getting your food. Don't worry though, it's totally worth the wait. 

The atmosphere is really relaxing and welcoming. They have a large amount of military uniforms displayed on the walls. After reading other reviews, it seems like the owners son was a member in the military and the place honors his legacy along with other servicemen. They also have a foundation set up to help military men and women. How can you not stop by this place and support the family's cause?"}
{"text":"Second time around. Still pleased. Had The Nuthouse sandwich and yum. Watch out for the Au Jus sauce its got a Kick."}
{"text":"We had their wings and the bacon and egg burger ... they were both delicious! Those wings are still on my mind! Definitely recommend this place!! Can't wait to go back and try out their breakfast"}
{"text":"Great food and people here. Loved the garlic fries. Music was calming. Place is small but perfect for lunch. Not crowed. Great Burgers"}
{"text":"All I know is that I will definitely return here for another \"build your own burger.\" I came here today with my dad & ordered the Brioche bun, medium cooked patty, pepper jack cheese, onion, lettuce & BBQ sauce with garlic fries on the side and it was absolutely fantastic. Our waitresses were very genuine and friendly, I love the patriotic feel to this place.. Overall great vibes and cannot wait to come back! Very good, highly recommend the burgers!!"}
{"text":"Great food, customer service excellent took a little bit long but that's good because this means food is fresh. I'll come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"after 6 times ... enough!   ... nice place, clean, friendly .... but a breakfast to go $15.67 ???  ...if you want it your way ... you will get all kinds of up charges ... a little gravy on tator tots = 75 cents xtra .... toast upgrade to a bagel = $2.75 xtra ... take out = $1.00 xtra ... i could eat a sit down full breakfast at the mirage hotel for about the same price.... food was okay ... but locals will wake up and resist the high prices.   coffee at starbucks cost $2.00  dougie's = $2.70 ???  sorry ... i hate being nickel & dimed .... i will pass....  adios!"}
{"text":"This little place was my favorite stop in Las Vegas! Delicious breakfast, easy parking, and an inspiring atmosphere! Coffee and cappuccino were delicious. I'll be a repeat customer for sure!"}
{"text":"There are many reasons to love Dougie J's Cafe: The burgers are awesome! The breakfast is so good! The owner is amazing! But the real draw for me is that the cafe was built to honor the men and women who serve our country in the military. The owner's son gave his life for our country serving in Afghanistan and his mother dedicates her life honoring his (including a foundation she setup to help service men and women deployed abroad called the Douglas J Green Memorial Foundation - djgmf.org). Whenever I am in the area and I am hungry, I will be dropping in for food and to support this amazing place!"}
{"text":"Great service, Delicious you-build-it omelet, paired with black beans and pancake.
WONDERFUL!!!   The salads that others were having looked GRETAT!!!"}
{"text":"We were headed out of town and wanted real food before our day of driving. This place didn't have good signage (they are getting it soon!) so don't give up! It is wonderful! The owner is so full of friendly energy that we were happy we stopped before we even got the food! Kids were able to order off the \"sides\" menu to get a pancake, French toast, eggs, etc in a smaller size. The coffee was good, and the tater tots were AMAZING! That sounds silly, but they were crispy and had some type of seasoning that made me really glad it wasn't a no carb day! 

Go for the food, but the atmosphere, people, cleanliness, EVERYTHING will make you glad you stopped by. If you are a veteran, bring a picture and they will add t to the wall. This was a wonderful find...we will be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients,  hot coffee, fantastic service. That a all I ask, and I got it. Loved the patriotic them and salute to our troops. Visable owners , who  made you feel right at home.If your downtown it's a must, on the strip jump in an uber"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars simply because our waitress Bernadette is AMAZING!! Totally incredible service!!! I'm not a huge fan of tots usually but those were tasty, too!"}
{"text":"Massive food portions.  Food is really good.  Quiet soft music playing.  Had a Groupon for breakfast.  Server was Genesis.  Young college student. My son's adored her.  Quick service & her menu suggestions were perfect.   I will be back again.   I know my sons will."}
{"text":"This place had great customer service! I went in during lunch time and wanted breakfast. They typically stop serving breakfast at that time, but let me order breakfast anyway. 

Great Americana atmosphere and the food was delicious. I will be going there again."}
{"text":"Incredible breakfast! Fantastic pancakes, sweet potatoes fries and French toast! Delicious chorizo and wonderful smoked bacon. Eggs are great. Staff was attentive and friendly. Parking is tricky so call and get info."}
{"text":"A small little breakfast/lunch spot. Only open until 3pm. The service was friendly, the food was good but food took quite a while to come out, approximately 40 minutes. We had to go re-feed the car meter outside because it took so long for our food to come out. 

I got the make your own breakfast which was a lot of food for $13. I went with an omelet made with chorizo, spinach and American cheese. Very flavorful and very filling. The home fries were fresh, the turkey bacon was also cooked to perfection.

Overall the food was good just wish it didn't take so long for the food. Especially since we were the only table there initially."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, I loved my philly sandwich and my daughter loved her patty melt. The service was very friendly, they tried hard and wanted to make everything right!!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast (especially the french with nutella). We went also here after our wedding at the graceland chapel... Sandwich and burger was excellent.
Nice place"}
{"text":"Took Uber and arrived at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday 5/3.  Place was not open despite published hours."}
{"text":"I went to Dougie J's with 2 of my friends I had the chorizo hash its was incredibly good!  Ive never tried anything like it before. I had it with two eggs on top over easy. Loved the decor very patriotic! I want to come back again and get the same thing it was that good.  My friends got the pancakes, they were huge! they could barely finish them all.  Service was great as well very friendly staff."}
{"text":"In Memory of a Soldier, Douglas J. Green

When I read the description of the restaurant it certainly wasn't your regular diner. When we arrived at the location in Downtown Las Vegas the outside did not look anything like a restaurant. The building belonged to a law firm or something. Paid parking is available right next to the building or drive inside the small alley way right next to the building and there is a parking lot immediately to the left.

We entered the restaurant and noticeable are all the military memorabilia displayed on the walls and small American flags on each dining table. Dougie J's Café is a restaurant dedicated to the memory of Douglas J. Green who was killed in action serving his country in Afghanistan. We were the only guests inside the place. We were not given any menus... there were none at the time? Instead the server told us of our choices. The menu was very limited but it's okay they had something we liked. I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger [$10.50] and hubby had an omelette. Our food was home-cooked and nicely presented... but most importantly, delicious! The restaurant served great traditional American food.

The owner and his server were nice and friendly. Owner chatted with us and mentioned that he lived in Sacramento over ten years ago. He served our country from 1988 to 1993 in the US Army as a 91B Combat Medic. He, a U.S. Army veteran, is doing an awesome thing with redemption program. He was telling us that the restaurant also serves as a culinary training course that introduces the knowledge and skills (with emphasis on planning, preparation and presentation of food) to meet the needs of the restaurant industry. I'd love to mention more about his program but if you happen to visit this place he'll be glad to chat with you more about it.

Review #1061"}
{"text":"We were in the area sight seeing and needed a place to grab a quick bite. This meal was delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place has to have the nicest owner here. Don't get me started on the Philly cheesesteak has to be the best in town.  Hospitality is a plus 10. Thank you for recommending it!!!!"}
{"text":"Dougie's has been one of my go-to breakfast places downtown. Although I haven't ventured around their menu too much, they have dishes that keep me coming back.

The holy grail dishes I constantly crave are their huveos rancheros and build your own breakfast option. 

1) Huevos rancheros: 
The dish comes smothered in green chili sauce, three eggs, pepper jack cheese and their salsa fresco is to die for. While presentation isn't the prettiest, the rancheros will certainly give your tastebuds a happy awakening. 

2) Build your own breakfast:
You basically have limitless options here: from getting your eggs anyway you desire, to making your meal into a sandwich, wrap, scramble or omelette. I'm set on constructing mine into a breakfast burrito. I suggest the same and please don't forget to ask for the salsa fresco. You won't regret it.

The vibe is always warm and welcoming. I almost always have Emma as a server. She is a delight!

So next time you're feeling breakfast and don't feel like waiting at your other downtown breakfast spots, check out Dougie's. It makes me sad that it this place doesn't get as much traffic as it deserves but I think it's just because people have discovered it yet."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant downtown, inside was clean with great decor. The food however was just ok... I ordered a southwest salad according to the menu Came with avocado, black beans, corn, red peppers & a chipotle ranch. Sounds good but what they brought me was lettuce with chicken on top & a few slivers of red peppers and regular ranch. No avocado No black beans No corn At first I was excited to find a new place for my breakfast or lunch everyday but sadly won't be this place."}
{"text":"Dougie house salad- basically a Caesar but the chicken was perfect. Good seasoning 
The dougie sandwich- pass
The crash- pass
Ricky tornado- delicious! They don't put it on the menu but it is possible to get half of this. Spicy and fresh but not worth driving this far to get it. 

Overall it was ok. Waitress gave us little to no attention unfortunately. She was the only server and had about 4 tables when we walked in at noon on a Saturday. We waited a good half hour to get 3 sandwiches, a Mac n cheese, and a salad. Currently waiting for our bill."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. A little hard to spot from the street but easy parking close by. Definitely plan on stopping in every time we're in town. Owner definitely cares about his business. He's cooking, bussing tables, bringing food out, AND checking on customers. Great place to stop in."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Close to downtown Fremont area, patriotic themed restaurant. The server was very friendly and helpful, and the food was excellent. Hubby ordered breakfast which he said was wonderful. Best pancakes ever, he said. I ordered a southwest salad which was not only delicious but extremely large. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My son recently graduated from the Navy, He volunteered in high school for Forgotten Not Gone a local nonprofit organization, Dougie J's partnered with FNG for this week. Veterans supporting Veterans. I  didn't know about Dougie J's and what it meant until today. I'm so glad I came out for this great cause. Great food, great service, and a veteran is the owner. Thanks for your service and I'll see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this new-ish place in DTLV!

My friend and I popped over here for lunch as it is super close to our work. At 11:30ish in the AM on a weekday I was pleasantly surprised to see it wasn't packed to the brim like a lot of other eateries downtown. The space, however, is on the small side, so if it were busy, you'd be in for a wait for a table!

Our server, who was very nice, and kept tabs on our table let us pick our seats. The place is decorated with military memorabilia and has the feeling of a small-town eatery -- just a place where the food is made with love for the locals.

I ordered \"The Oz\", which is on their sandwich menu. It's a hoagie roll stuffed with wonderful meatballs, topped with melty cheese. There was just enough marinara sauce for this sandwich to easily be eaten by hand, while only a bit of the sauce leaked out while I was enjoying it. What my friend and I really appreciated was that you could order the sandwich in a smaller size (there are two options for all the sandwiches in the menu). I opted for the side salad with a side of ranch. It's nothing spectacular, but I always appreciate a side choice other than french fries. 

I will definitely be back here to try a few more items off the menu!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing burger and the tater tots were perfect. More places need good tater tots. Had a chance to talk with the owner and I'm proud to support the cafe and what they're doing, and planning to."}
{"text":"Horrible portions sizes for the price. I ordered the Sunni Southwest salad it was $8 with tax delivery and tip my order was over $10. I received less than a handful of lettuce and 3 black beans and 2 very thin slices of red bell pepper, there was less than a 1/2 of ounce of chicken on the salad. Will never order anything from here again.  What a rip off"}
{"text":"First time here, it's a small place that has parking in the alleyway where the big church is located behind it otherwise there is paid parking on the street.

I arrived around 1:30 and the place was pretty empty.  The service was very good and everyone was very friendly.  Emma did a great job keeping everyone satisfied checking on drinks and just sharing a smile.

The food is comfort food and prepared with attention to detail.  The menu has a lot of items to choose from and seeing some of the dishes coming out of the kitchen makes you want to try everything you see, that is how much attention is being put forth.  To sit there and be awed by the plates coming out, they are doing something right in the kitchen.  

The decor is a tribute to the military and this great country.  I like this place and this is a place I would recommend when in the area or just wanting a place to check out.  Easy to get to and find, other customers here are friendly as well, something you don't always find here in Vegas.  Check it out sometime."}
{"text":"Really great neighborhood spot. Every time I've come in they have been extremely pleasant. The meatball sandwich is delicious, and the chicken and biscuit is tender and tasty."}
{"text":"The Sweet Potato and Chorizo Hash is amazing.

Employee here was super friendly and nice. Great find!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, big portions and great saucy flavors. I've eaten there several times and my favorites so far are the peanut butter banana bacon on french toast bread (for obvious reasons!) and the rueben style sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service.   Yeah, it's s hole in the wall and parking sucks, but it's a nice place once you get in there.  And, it's veteran owned, so all veterans are welcome."}
{"text":"Came in on recommendations from several Native Las Vegas people. Absolutely amazing food!! Got breakfast foods while the table next to us got lunch. Great atmosphere. Love the decor . prices were so low compared to other places here in Vegas. Definitely a spot of the beaten path to remember and enjoy."}
{"text":"Walked up to this place for the first time and my friend almost left thinking they were closed.  I checked the door and it was open and lights were on inside. It looks closed from the outside but go right on in they are open.  The place is quiet and has a good atmosphere. They were not busy at all but some of my food was cold.  everything tasted great and the prices were ok.  There is military memorabilia on the walls that was interesting to look at.  I would probably go back if I was in the area but would not go out of my way."}
{"text":"While driving down the street, you WILL miss this place, but that's the point of a hole-in-the-wall treasure.

Walking in, their unapologetic Americana decor reminds you that this place is Veteran-owned and operated. There's a down home, country aesthetic with modern touches to make you feel right at home. 

The wait staff was extremely friendly and made us feel like a part of their family. From the time we got seated to the time we got our food was exactly 6 minutes...AMAZING! 

The food - the food was great and perfectly priced. It doesn't over fill you, but definitely hits the spot. Everything was home made and tasted like mama made.

Overall a great place to escape the price-gauging of Vegas."}
{"text":"Had to wait to write this review...so here it goes 
The only reason I heard if this place was because of Groupon.  Was it great...not so much at least on breakfast.  It took waaaaaaaay toooooo looooong to be served...especially because we were the only ones there.  The reason we went was for breakfast...and just nothing special I found....so I thought to myself maybe if I order their sandwich for my dinner...again nothing special 
Sorry....the service was good(besides the wait)and the decor was great dedicated to our service men and women.  My advice put a boot to the cook with this great location put your foot on the peddle and SPEED UP!!!  
and maybe rethink something better for breakfast those chorizo plate seemed too lazy"}
{"text":"Super friendly, the food was great... this is an excellent place!!  I'll definitely visit next time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast one morning.  It seems a bit chaotic despite us being the only people in the place.  The oatmeal was the best thing we ordered, big and fresh.  We also got the simple bacon and egg plate as well as the hash.  Both seemed fresh but neither was super impressive.
Look for a groupon for here to perhaps save a few bucks."}
{"text":"This is an amazingly delicious place with an even more amazing/important mission.  The woman that owns this restaurant is so driven and talented!  Visit this place and if possible chat with the owner, you will definitely not be disappointed both with the company and the food!"}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to the downtown area! If you live in one of the surrounding high rises you should definitely take the short walk or bike ride and enjoy Dougie J's! 

I had a custom made breakfast omelette, courtesy of Brian. I asked him to make me what he likes and I most certainly wasn't disappointed. The food came out quickly and was both hot and delicious. 

It's important to help out quality local business, especially one with such an honorable background. The owner's son is a US Army veteran who was KIA while serving in Afghanistan. His name was Douglas J. Green. Since then she has worked tirelessly to help our service men and women, primarily through the Douglas J Green Memorial Foundation. 

I'm glad I stopped in. Please come support these awesome patriotic entrepreneurs!"}
{"text":"Crazy good food! Seriously, frosted flakes on French toast?! Yeah it happened and it's great! The atmosphere is stellar, military theme as a tribute to the owners son who was KIA in Iraq."}
{"text":"Fast service, great food, and an amazingly friendly owner! Love to support veteran-owned businesses!"}
{"text":"Gotta say, top rate food quality at a great price. Got it to go on Grub Hub today, and the sweet potato fries were crispy and plentiful, burger was cooked perfect (I ordered rare) and the bun was fresh. It was done quick (10 mins) and so convenient to park around the corner on bonneville and just walk in. Highly recommend."}

Owned and operated by Suni Chabrow with a menu crafted by her longtime friend and business partner, a former bodybuilder and attorney downtown, Dougie J's Café is Sin City's only Patriotic dining locale and with a portion of the proceeds benefitting the Memorial Foundation of Suni's fallen hero son it is undoubtedly the sort of space that everyone would love to see succeed, the potential no doubt there but a few tweaks necessary before the food will truly 'wow.'

Patriotically decorated without pandering to the \"USA, USA\" crowd it was after contacting Suni directly about the restaurant's concept and the possibility of ordering a few 'half-portions' to better assess the menu that I arrived at for Saturday lunch and with both Ms. Chabrow and the menu's creator present throughout my hour-long stay it can only be said that the whimsical cuisine and story of the space was interesting and inspiring, respectively, while both were thoroughly explained.

Largely opting to indulge in breakfast, while allowing the Chef liberty with portion sizes and price, it was with a full order of The Riz that the meal began and featuring well-saturated brioche from Bon Bread at its base the French Toast sandwiching Nutella and Whip was decidedly sweet, a pitcher of artificial maple syrup thankfully unnecessary both here and in the follow-up blueberry pancake that was fluffy and well aerated, more than suitable for sopping up butter as well as blueberry reduction though the berries within the batter were somewhat disappointing and bland.

Chatting with the proprietors as I ate, stories including Soni's decision to pursue a lifelong passion for making English Toffee striking a chord about the value of following one's dreams, it was next that a whole order of the Pink Diablo arrived and drawing on concepts other restaurants would just as happily attributed to Elvis both the portion and flavor was plethoric, though much of the nuance was lost due to far too much peanut butter, a half portion more than enough to satisfy my curiosity though I did indeed pay for a whole.

Next sent out a half \"Bubba,\" a dish I neither desired nor requested but was happy to try given the staff's glowing reviews, suffice it to say that between the watery pastrami and substantial amount of slaw little of the $6.50 I was charged for the gift was worth it, the 'Dougie Sauce' a lone exception with a whole lot of heat packed into the Russian-Style cream.

Back to items I'd inquired about, it was to a haphazard 'torn' half biscuit alongside fried chicken with thick country gravy that I was treated next and with the bird pounded flat and nearly flavorless while the biscuit large but no better than Bisquick suffice it to say this was a major miss, a fact made all the more humorous when the man behind the menu idly poked fun at the food at Hash-House-a-Go-Go before also admitting the lazy-man ingredient was used in Dougie J's signature blueberry coffee cake - a dish still well worth ordering given the substantial use of cinnamon and delicate, buttery crumb.

Unable to make me an Apple Fritter, one of the items I'd specifically requested and one that Suni couldn't stop raving about even after telling me the restaurant had failed to procure apples on that day, it was with a single \"Bad Influence\" cookie that my meal ended and served hot and gooey from the oven with bits of Suni's Whoa! Foods Toffee filling the batter alongside bittersweet cranberries anyone in the area, which means anyone in DTLV or East Fremont, should consider stopping in to grab one...or perhaps a dozen as it may just be the best cookie on Las Vegas Boulevard right now.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Originally served a bill with a pre-tip of just under $75 - whole stacks of pancakes, full sandwiches, and a full  order of chicken and biscuits rang up along with what I'd actually ordered...and the Bubba which I had not...but later adjusted to a tally of $62 inclusive of tax and tip, the prices at Dougie J's are unfortunately far out of line to the quality of product used or served and while I'm happy to donate to a great cause like The Douglas J. Green Foundation I'd have sooner done so on a voluntary basis rather than be upcharged for many of the things I tasted, though there are undoubtedly some gems on the menu to be found."}
{"text":"Rating is based on only one visit for breakfast. Food was great and portion servings were very generous! Restaurant was small and cozy. A bit hidden away in downtown Vegas, but an easy walk from the Fremont district."}
{"text":"Food was good, waitress was very nice but service was slow. We got here at 11:30am and received our food until 1:00pm. Only one waitress... she's running around trying to keep everyone happy. Overall ok but we won't be back."}
{"text":"How is this place still open?! They post no hours on their window?? I tried stopping by and the sign said open and the doors were locked? Something this simple concerns me. If you can catch them when they are open that would be a good start!  Guessing they are open when they want to be open."}
{"text":"We love our veterans! And this place is a good reason why! The staff here went above and beyond to please us girls! Even had GLUTEN FREE  tator tots that were delicious ! Philly cheesesteak omelette was amazing and wow, coffee was good too! Great people- great vibes- great food and great coffee! God bless the US and all who visit our lands!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and there was only one other table in the building. It's a small restaurant with a small menu consisting of burgers, sandwiches, and breakfast. 

I went with a cheeseburger on a pretzel bun with Dougie sauce. It took a while to come out. It smelled foul, I'm guessing something in the sauce. I take a bite and see the pretzel bun is dry and stale. After the long wait to order and receive our food I'd given up. The only good thing was the fries. I got garlic or parm and they were hot and delicious! I took the burger to go but ended up chunking it. 

Overall I wasn't impressed, maybe I should've went with their breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is delicious american food with an wonderful vibe. The sandwiches are all amazing. Do yourselves a favor and try the chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"Day after thanksgiving. The food was very good. There were 4 of us and we all enjoyed our breakfast very much. My eggs were cooked to perfection (not everyone gets over medium eggs right) the bacon was really good, nice and crispy with great flavor. One son and I had French toast and a side of eggs. French toast was really good. Hubs had huevos rancheros and other son had sweet potato and chorizo with eggs.  Both loved their food and cleaned their plates. Service was great. Very attentive! Even better we had a great Groupon."}
{"text":"One star because I got free cookies at the end of my meal. :) This place was overpriced and has super sub par quality food. Ham looks like it's out of an Oscar Meyer box, I asked if I could have it hot/toasted and they literally just put bread in a toaster then cold ham and cheese. :-P Meatball sandwich was dry and most likely frozen. No extra sauce and cheese barely melted. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and fries.  Service was mediocre as staff seemed to hang in the back.  Nice selection of lunch items and spacious.  I had the dougie special which I liked.  Not a fast place if you're on a lunch schedule.  Park off the strip."}
{"text":"What a quaint lil hole in the. But damn the food is awesome. The portions are huge. Well worth the short drive."}
{"text":"We went here because it is in memory of a fallen soldier that this restaurant was created. As a veteran I had to go. This place is great! Love the food! The owner Ralph is also a veteran and bought this place to keep Dougie J's memory alive! Seeing  that I was a veteran Ralph introduced himself to us and actually sat down and talk to us for a  few minutes. I encourage everybody to check this place out!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here, let me start bye saying parking is horrible! Secondly, we were a party of nine, and were prepared for a wait!! But 2 hours after being seated we were told the cook ran out of eggs and had left the building to buy more! Their was only ONE waitress and they were at capacity! Now, the food was good, but NOT worth the 2 hour wait! Sorry NOT Sorry! Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast in Las Vegas .Extremely friendly service extremely low prices cool atmosphere. if I had one place to go to for breakfast this would be it every single day"}
{"text":"Located on the outskirts of Downtown Las Vegas, this little diner packs a massive punch on flavor. They have the classic diner menu with breakfast and lunch items. I always go for the  make your own scramble breakfast plate. My go-to creation includes: chorizo, all the veggies, pepperjack cheese, avocado and salsa. It comes with their country potatoes and a side of toast. Whenever we have time  we also get the made to order biscuits and gravy. If you're looking for a filling meal at at a great price then definitely come to this spot."}
{"text":"Thank you for the great service and delicious, home-made tasting breakfast. My partner and I have dined at just about every breakfast place in Las Vegas; however, we have chosen to frequent Dougie J's because of the coziness of the restaurant and the natural taste of the food. After consequitevely having faulty eggs at other restaurants, I was happy my partner found Dougie J' s where the eggs in both our sandwich and skillet were fantastic! Thank you. I will recommend to my family and friends."}
{"text":"This is a hidden Las Vegas gem. Small intimate venue.  \"Dougie\" was the owner's son who was an unfortunate casualty in Afghanistan.  The decor is tasteful, respectful, Veteran oriented - not over the top.  Our waitress, Emma, was bright cheery and helpful. My wife had the sweet potato chorizo hash. And I had the huevos rancheros. Both were outstanding!  Dougie's is worth going to and is right next to \"Pawn Stars\" pawn shop - a popular attraction."}
{"text":"I attended the grand opening on dec 7, sampling various dishes, and ate here today for the first time. The food is unique, well thought out, and good sized portions. I tried the chorizo sweet potato hash and pancakes last time, and had planned on ordering the hash today...until I noticed something totally different.  I can't remember the name for some reason, but it's listed in the sandwich section. 

Peanut butter, bananas, and bacon (!) sandwiched between fried bread encrusted with frosted flakes. Sounds funky, but the blend of warm peanut butter and bacon--the salty--works great with the sweet corn flakes and bananas. It's not a burger, or a sandwich, so you may have to be looking for this kind of combo, but I cleaned the plate! 

I chose fruit salad (bananas, pineapple, apples) instead of fries. The only criticism I'd make is that due to the sandwich contents, I had banana overload, but the fruit was fresh, cut, and a good sized portion."}
