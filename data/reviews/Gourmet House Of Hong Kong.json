{"text":"One star for the cleanliness. Picked this place because the reviews on Yelp were very good. Well, the place appeared very clean, odd that they have you walk through the kitchen to the dining area. We were not impressed with the food. Do not order the appetizer sampler platter, everything is fried to a crisp. There was also a faint odor to some of the dishes starting with the egg drop soup. It doesn't get any better. Not impressed, not coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I needed some good ole fashioned comfort food the other night and nothing fits that bill like takeout Chinese. Since I abhor China Chili and we didn't want to drive too far, we checked the yelp reviews and gambled on this place.  He ordered the Mongolian Beef, his standard order and had nothing negative to say about it but, meh, nothing good either. It's supposed to be spicy, right? It wasn't I ordered the shrimp lo Mein with lobster sauce. Mmm, SOUNDS yummy but the ramen noodles just blew it for me.  Ramen. Noodles. For crying out loud, ramen?!!! The shrimp was good, the sauce was tasty, but......ramen.  The restaurant was set up kinda weird. You walk in and have a dining area to the left and to the right and in the middle is an open kitchen. The place could use a little updating and TLC.  I tried to like it but I think I'll just have to pass on this place continue my search for decent Chinese food in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"A great authentic Chinese restaurant. The Five Flavor Squid and Won ton Noodle soup with BBQ Pork, is as good as any I have had. Even compared to restaurants in the china towns of Washington D C or New York City. I have been coming here since 2005 and have tried most things on the menu. I haven't had a bad dish yet.   The service is prompt and friendly. It is a very casual atmosphere no need to dress up here. The food coming out of the kitchen is just good, real Chinese food."}
{"text":"Is it normal for \"Thai-style chicken\" to look like pineapple?   Just got back from lunch with my co-worker.  It was nearby, had decent reviews and I wanted Chinese. My co-worker, whose Chinese, jumped at the opportunity to go to a new place for lunch nearby since she usually only goes to places her friends recommend.  Overall - it was ok-good. Staff was friendly - suggested what I try. Co-Worker (CW) was excited about the Thai menu. She'd been talking about Hot & Sour soup and hasn't found any in PHX she likes except one place in the far away land of Chandler (compared to West PHX).   HOneslty, she seemed a little disappointed in the food. Hot & Sour soup (from the Chinese menu, not the Thai H&S) was sour, but not hot. She had me try, and I'm no hot & sour judge, but it had some funky (read: not good) taste to it. They brought a wonton and egg roll with her #7 Thai combo (can't remember what it was called). Both were overfried. She mentioned it's like it was fried then refried. HOWEVER, the insides of the egg roll were quite tasty. Wonton- not so much. Corn soup came with my #1 Pad Thai lunch special...it was broth with corn. Very simple. I suppose I expected a little more but it was exactly what they said, corn soup. I should have gotten a salad.   Moving on to the actual lunch. Pad Thai, I've never had much Thai food and I enjoyed this quite a bit. Now I can't compare this to anything else so it's just my taste buds talking. Is it normal for the chicken to look like pineapple? That threw me off - it was cubed and had a yellow-ish tint. It was very soft too - gave me a weird I like/don't like feeling. But i continued to eat and overall, I liked it.   My CW got the #7 Thai special that came in a bowl. Had lots of veggies, chicken in some creamy spicy sauce. She had me try the sauce and it was pretty good (I wish I had taken more to put on my meal from her bowl when she offered). I'm not so sure she enjoyed the place as much and I'm not surprised. At the end of our meal she mentioned she'd like to find a \"really good\" Chinese place to take us to and was going to talk to her friends.   I wouldn't mind going back to try the Chinese menu - they have a huge selection and it's nearby, a great price for lunch, not busy and pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Had Xmas Eve dinner at Gourmet and was sorely disappointed.  Wondering if the main chef was on holiday already.  The Peking duck was beyond dry and the sauteed fish was swimming in far too much gravy and didn't taste in the least bit fresh.  Kept wishing I had made the drive to Asian Cafe Express instead."}
{"text":"My husband and I first came here on Sunday 3/29/15 as China Chilli was closed. I was a bit hesitant due to the 3.5 stars. Let me tell you, I'm glad I walked in these doors. The sever was so nice and we placed our order. Good came promptly and it was DELISH!! My husband is a picky eater and said he was also impressed.  Today we felt like eating out and our first thought was lets go back to the place on Sunday. Today we ordered the egg foo young and it's made out of scratch (China chilli I found out makes their patties in the morning and they reheat them). We also ordered the chow main and that was good too. In closing, im glad we decided to try this place on Sunday as this is my new favorite place to eat Chinese."}
{"text":"I would rate GHHK a 3.9 if I could. Solid place, definitely recommend it for dine in or carry out. I almost always get carry out so the beat up digs are not an issue for me. Yes, the building is old and the location could be described as iffy. No, I've never felt unsafe nor have I worried about the cleanliness.    The orange duck is what keeps me ordering!!"}
{"text":"this place has slipped notably since ownership changed several years ago: smaller portions, fewer bonafide Cantonese dishes (beef stew, pork ribs, chow fun options) and service ($8 lunch, waitress nowhere to be had till bill, takes $10 and never came back).   it's above average, especially for lunch, but a shell of its former self. that the restaurant charges ($1) for hot tea (cheap tea bag) speaks volumes of the operation."}
{"text":"Dive Chinese food place in a neighborhood that unfortunately has steadily gone downhill over the past four decades. They serve exceptionally good food, all the standard options."}
{"text":"Staff is very nice Price is good. Close to home. Food is unfortunately mediocre not what we thought.  Had read the reviews and that's how we got here.  When we walked in it smelled like a ton of grease when we tasted it tasted like grease. Not sure if we got a bad batch but we had gotten five plates and they all were pretty bland. Have yet to decide if a second chance will be given."}
{"text":"After reafing the previous reviews ... they must have a new chef. Worst Chinese meal we have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Definitely an odd location, but I love it since I live pretty close by.  I agree with other reviews, not a lot of good Chinese options.  I give this 5 stars for the area, but really 4 stars cause it's not like this is the best place ever.  But I don't think you will be disappointed if you go here.  Odd that they do both Thai and Chinese, but again I think that is due to a lack of good asian food in the area.  I have only tried the Chinese dishes so far.  A lot of things come plain or with veggies.  Definitely catering to any style.  I wasn't happy with the Chow Fun the first time, because it came plain.  Then the next time I ordered with veggies, and it was exactly what I wanted.  Now I order this every time (the dry version).  I really like the Wunan Beef.  And the twice cooked pork.  Didn't like the black bean chicken, was bland, but I probably could have spiced it up with their condiments.    This is my new go to for take out.   Give it a try, I think you will be happy.  Just wish they delivered.  Oh - and the first time I went, there was about 3 cop cars out front, very good sign!  If the cops and firefighters eat there, it must be good.  Especially when there is more than 1 car, that means they met there on purpose... even better sign of good food!  And they have brown rice, not everybody does yet."}
{"text":"Food was garbage lo mein was spaghetti noodles in some weird thick cornstarch sauce bland to the maxx had cabbage core but no green cabbage inside who eats the hard white part of the cabbage. the entire dish was white and the chicken had a foul taste and the white parts of cabbage had black mold seriously....i did not eat it Its going in the garbage someone needs to call dirty dining on this place they need to to be shut down as soon as possible when you walk into the place your in the kitchen how is that sanitary this place gets 0 stars dont waste your time or money you might end up with food poisoning!"}
{"text":"This place is way more than I expected. The Orange duck was phenomenal. The staff was attentive but not annoying and the prices are very good considering the portions."}
{"text":"I have a tendency to judge a Chinese restaurant based on their hot and sour soup.  I'd have to say that 90% of the time the quality of the soup reflects the rest of menu.  Well, this hot and sour soup was disgusting.  The aroma it emitted was that of sewer/smelly feet.  Also what is up with the mini shrimp in it?  Since when does authentic hot and sour soup contain protein?  Never again."}
{"text":"\"Recently refurbished Chinese restaurant in an old part of town.\"  Go through the front door and you find yourself in the kitchen! Lengthy new menu with prices about $8-11 per entree. Service was excellent, even when we lingered for an hour after the meal, visiting. Food came out quickly, portions average size, ingredients looked and tasted fresh. We ordered \"deep fried fish\", that had black mushrooms, onions and slivers of pork, in a brown gravy. Extraordinary taste and smell!! Also had Sechuan Shrimp, a spicy dish containg many medium sized shrimp, flavorful, mildly spicy, both served with rice. They offered a special dessert, mango with sticky rice, but we passed, as we were full. They close at 9pm."}
{"text":"The food is blah. I ate there for a long time just because it is the closest Asian restaurant, but really the food could be better.... OK, it could be a lot better. A long time ago, I used to love their frog legs, but now they are so bad I cant even tell you. The abundance of sauce ruined the crispiness of the frog legs. I was so disappointed!  They raised their prices by 50% or more on some dishes & sides. Some of the prices have almost doubled. For example, the small rice was $1. Now, it's $1.50 extra. The large was $2. Now, it's $3.50.  It is something stupid but still annoying.  Also, it is hard to order food from them over the phone... To tell you the truth I sometimes have trouble ordering food from them there because they dont seem to be able to communicate very well in English. And you always have to double check your order.  The food is inconsistent.  It's not great but it's food and still fairly inexpensive. I wont bother eating there again because their food keeps getting worse & worse. I have had 2 friends get sick from their food. Watch out for their chicken! My friend said he got undercooked chicken from this place.  Also, They wont give out copies of their to-go menu with the new prices on it. So you kinda just have to take their word for it on the new prices... It used to be a place we went often but it's getting to the point that I'm kinda just over this place.  Yah, the more I think about it, I'm way over this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I lived in Bangkok, Thailand for four years while on assignment for the American Embassy.  While there we were exposed to all levels, including the finest, in Chinese cuisine.  A few years after retiring we moved to Phoenix and, for one reason or another, have been disappointed in the quality of Chinese cuisine found here.  That is, until last Sunday when we accepted a recommendation to try The Gourmet House of Hong Kong with friends.  We ordered several of the soups and entrees.  Prices were reasonable, service was excellent and all items were quickly served piping hot.  This first experience here brought back wonderful memories of the lengthy time we spent in Asia.  Items we ordered were Wonton Soup, Hot and Sour Soup, Green Curry Pork Clay Pot, Egg Rolls, Crab Puffs, Kung Pao Shrimp, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Peking Duck and Almond Chicken.  All were authentic in quality and flavor and will most surely be ordered and enjoyed again as we continue to explore the restaurant's lengthy menu.  This restaurant receives our best recommendation."}
{"text":"I have been here on two occasions and both times their crab puffs were cold in the middle (probably fried from being frozen, not fresh). Their beef lo mein had a strange flavor to it, did not like the sauce. And their sesame chicken was unlike any other I've had at other Chinese restaurants. My concern is the freshness of the ingredients: seems like they are either using frozen or canned. This place would be a hit if they just went to a grocery store every day and only cooked the freshest ingredients cooked to order. The kitchen seems busy and adequate enough, but the restaurant seating area is empty (at least the two times I went there). I get the impression that this is a large family-owned restaurant that has gotten lazy over the years. Gordon Ramsay needs to pay a visit."}
{"text":"We found this place by GPS. It was really much much better than what we had expected before entering the restaurant.  I highly recommend the daily soup, which is authentic. All other entrees we got were fabulous."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the complaints about this place.  I've been going here for years, and the food has always been solid, cheap, quick and really tasty.  The menu is huge, and I have no complaints about the service or cleanliness of the place, either.    I usually get the fried tofu with garlic sauce.  It's transcendent.  Crispy, delicious triangles of fried tofu and a fantastic mushroom-garlic-onion sauce with some brown rice....I have dreams about it.  If I have the cash, I'll get some spring rolls with spicy mustard, which are a hot, crispy delight.  Haters gonna hate, I guess.  I just wish it was open all night!"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer here for 15 years. The staff and food are great. The prices cant be beat, especially during lunch hours. A great variety of food from seafood to vegetarian to meat and poultry dishes. This is truly a Phoenix gem!!"}
{"text":"GHHK has been one of my favorite Chinese food restaurants since I was a child. Food is very authentic, delicious and always for a great price!"}
{"text":"So I sent the Lemongrass Shrimp back. They were gross. Not edible.  I've only been here twice. The first time I thought the food was good. I had shrimp, a chicken dish and a spring roll and it was was pretty decent. The second time (tonight) everything was gross. Like my stomach churns at the thought of ever going back.  The service was very good, though. So at least that aspect of my experience tonight doesn't make me quesy. I feel bad wrting this because they were so nice. I was going to give it 2 stars but they were really nice to me so 3 stars."}
{"text":"I hate when this happens.  You go to a restaurant you \"super-like' and then upon your return it fizzles out like a second rate firecracker.   The last time this place got 5 stars from me.  Here's what happened last night.    We started off with an order of two soups:  Egg drop and Wonton.  I remembered the fabulousness of the wonton soup in the past.  Delicate, very delicate wontons in an extraordinarily delicious broth.  Couldn't wait to taste it again. Ordered Chow Mein with beef which came with brown sauce. Told the waitress to keep the brown sauce separate.  She said she didn't quite think she could do this.  She said she could give me the noodles separate, the beef separate and the brown sauce separate.  I asked, \"Couldn't you do the noodles with the beef and just the sauce separately?  She said she would have to talk to the cook as he has never done this before.  Reminds me of the movie \"FIVE EASY PIECES\" with Jack Nicholson.  He asked for a tuna on toast and the waiter said he could have a tuna sandwich but not on toast because they don't have tuna on toast on the menu.  I will say no more.  You just HAVE TO watch the movie.    We also ordered orange chicken and asked if we could have it without breading and very spicy.  She said yes. We added an order of fried tofu which came with a sauce similar to the ones served with dumplings.  The soups arrived and the wonton soup was not what I remembered it to be.  (You guys are not going to start questioning my memory are you?)   The broth was mediocre and while the wonton were delicate, they were not flavorful.  Hubby said the egg drop soup was OK. (that means not so good in husband-speak).  The orange chicken arrived as requested, no breading. But with no spice.  He had to add spice from a metal jar on the table which was nothing more than pepper flakes in oil.  Does anyone want to consciously add oil to their food?  Don't most of us try to avoid adding calories if possible?  The preferred method to add spiciness to a dish is for THE COOK to sauté the meat WITH HOT PEPPERS thereby imparting a nice overall spiciness to the dish.  But this was not to be so spicy oil it was.  Remarkably, the beef chow mein arrived with noodles & beef together and the brown sauce separately. Amazing.  IT COULD BE DONE!  Is this NOBEL prize worthy?  The chef was actually able to serve noodles & beef together and the sauce separately????!!   Should we be sharing this accomplishment with other restaurants or with the FOOD NETWORK?    I marveled at the large amount of \"brown sauce\" they put on the side.  What exactly is in that brown sauce.? I'm afraid to ask.  But it seems that this brown sauce is their \"go to\" sauce for almost every dish.  Back to the dish.  The chow mein noodles were totally dry but the beef was moist enough to eat.  I now understand the purpose of the brown sauce--basically it wets down dry food, in this case the noodles.  I ate some of it but will tell you now that I would not ever order this dish again.  The fried tofu came out in blocks resembling kids play blocks; maybe a bit smaller.  Not greasy but not the most pleasant tasting tofu I've had either.  The soy-sauce based sauce that came with it is a MUST HAVE if there is any chance of you swallowing this tofu.  Another dish I would not order again.  Don't get me wrong.  I eat tofu.  I like tofu.  I order tofu all the time (and eat it).  It's just that the preparation in this tofu dish was really, really lacking.   And now for the good parts.  The portions are very generous.  The waitress was very nice and wanted us to accommodate us at the table of our choice since the TV was showing football and hubby's eyes immediately went to the screen.  (Gee, how unusual. ) Finally the pricing is very reasonable.  You can't go wrong with the prices, but then again you can't go right with the food either.  I, for one, am not returning."}
{"text":"Best hot and sour soup! Service is always top notch. Chow fun is amazing! Great affordable lunch menu and quick service if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Let me start with the positive. The corn chicken soup was hot and the won ton chips were a nice addition to the soup. The chicken egg roll was very greasy. My main dish was the cashew chicken. It was white meat but had to pick through it to get a decent piece without icky's on it. The flavor was bland, so I decided to add chili paste. It was hot, but tasteless. It was on the way to downtown, but will note return here again. YUCK!!!"}
{"text":"For such a big place like the Phoenix area there is a surprisingly horrible selection of Chinese food.  The Gourmet House is a pleasant surprise.  Driving up and seeing the bars on the windows with a bit of an old hole of the wall looking exterior it does make you pause a bit, but don't let that dissuade you.  They have an outstanding Moo Shu Vegetable dish ( Moo Shu pork sans pork).  They bring it out and the server actually wraps them for you using a big spoon and chopsticks without actually handling the flour wraps with her hands.  It's very impressive and fun to watch. I have never seen that done before.  Try: - Moo Shu Vegetables. - Peking Duck"}
{"text":"Great food... Had red curry chicken with rice, egg rolls, raggoons... And hot&sour soup... All but the soup was above average in taste!! The hot and sour soup has a strong vinegar taste, not a fan of."}
{"text":"I think I was spoiled growing up.   I used to live ten minutes away from the best Chinese food restaurant I've ever eaten at. I've traveled far and wide and still nothing matches my home grown favorite. Alas, the ten minute drive would now be a two hour drive.   Since moving to Phoenix I've been on the lookout for good hot and sour soup. On the advice from Iain B, I decided to give gourmet House of Hong Kong a try.   I've driven past this restaurant many, many times and never once did I think about stopping. The neighborhood isn't what I'd call inviting and the building itself doesn't exactly say, 'Eat here!' Nevertheless, I had faith in Iain and would see this thing through.   The menu is huge, like maybe a hundred items deep. Sifting through all of the choices it was nice to see all the usual suspects, but some relatively unique dishes as well.   Though I came here specifically for hot and sour soup, there were so many enticing options I decided to get a little crazy.   Takeout Order:   -Crab Puffs  -Mixed Veggie and Wonton Soup  -Curry Beef Stew and Noodle Soup  -Wunan Beef  -Sweet and Sour Chicken   Total: Around 25 bucks!   Fifteen minutes later I was able to sample the food from the comfort of my home and WOW! This place is legit! For the price I would have been pleased with adequate food, but each item really blew me away.   The crab puffs were more crab meat than cream cheese, with great flavor. The Curry Beef stew was amazing, with an excellent flavor (they actually put this in two containers, one for the beef and noodles with one for the broth. Nice touch!). The Wunan beef had just the right amount of fire to it, and was just plain delicious.   I'm already planning my next trip to Gourmet House of Hong Kong. The quality of food is truly amazing for the price.   Oh, and next time I'll get the hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"I don't get some of these poor reviews.  The decor is spare but attractive, the place seems clean enough to me, the prices are good, and I've never had a bad meal there over the past 20 years.  My current favorite is the mussels, either ginger-and-onion  or black-bean.  The mussels are big and plump and plentiful, nicely presented and piping hot.  My friends have liked their dishes, too.  I've had worse Chinese food (including in China), but seldom better.  Just wish I lived closer, but I can always make an excuse to travel to a place I like as much as GHHK."}
{"text":"My third timing coming. I really want to work with them because there's not much Chinese in Phoenix and the staff is super nice; however, the sauce is horrible! More so, it seems like every sushi us cooked in the same hiring, blabs way too sweet sauce. I will not be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were introduced to Gourmet House a long time ago. Nowadays it seems it's more the odd take-out order instead of going to the place, but today I met a friend for lunch at GH and liked it very much, again.  Food was quite simple but nicely presented. Really tasty chicken with bean sprouts, a nice simple celery vegetable soup as a starter.  It's much cleaner and has great plates, wish I had them at home!  I look forward to going again and diving deeper into the huge menu."}
{"text":"Looking for a Chinese food place had a hard time finding one that I felt like I could take my kids to and go inside. The area is kind of rough cost a grand down Phoenix so just wondering but gave it a chance the outside appearance is a little rough in the building but after going in the food was great pricing was good service was wonderful and the kids even enjoyed all the food"}
{"text":"Suspicious ambience but the co-workers rave about the food... After my visit here I probably won't be coming back. There was a bug on the wall when we sat down that was an instant turn off. The food was a little bland and had stomach issues after I left this establishment. Sadly, won't be coming back. Sorry co-workers!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. Huge menu, prompt service and a decent atmosphere. The lunch specials are fantastic and the sticky mango deer (when in season) is to die for!  Worth a stop if your in the area!!"}
{"text":"Until recently I have been a long time patron of what may have been the finest Chinese eating establishment in Arizona. There were many memories made here. I moved away several years ago which made it difficult to get back to one of my all time favorite restaurants. Recently between appointments I found myself at lunch time both hungry and near this landmark. I was unaware of the ownership change until I walked in and was not greeted by familiar or friendly service.   Since I was on limited time I ordered from the lunch menu expecting the the same service as I had been accustomed. Wrong. The order was taken in reasonable time but the food arrived luke warm almost 35 minutes later as I was preparing to leave. The lunch special wasn't very special and bordered on disgusting. Running late for my appointment, I had to track down staff so that I could get a guest check and pay my bill. I can say that both service and food quality were consistent: SUB PAR. It is unlikely I will return."}
{"text":"Very nice people.  The waitress was consistent and make sure everything was up to par.   Very good food and would highly recommend it again."}
{"text":"Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?  A few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.  The fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.    I'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge."}
{"text":"My experiences here are always a little weird, but the food is great and I love the patio. :)"}
{"text":"Ok - so I used to live minutes from china town in NYC...  so I'm perhaps a little spoiled.  I realize that.   I still have not found a Chinese food place here in phoenix that I'm crazy about...I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm not gonna. That being said... this is by far the *worst* Chinese I've had here so far. They are right around the corner from where i live so i decided to give it a try for take out one night... they got our order wrong, it took forever, and it was completely flavorless...  I had a few bites and lost my appetite.  Maybe I ordered the wrong things...  maybe I was there on an off night...   who knows.  But as far as I'm concerned - Vegetable lo mien shouldn't be that difficult to get right.  My boyfriends meal (forget what he got) was no better.   I won't be going back.  Its a real shame too since the location is ideal for me...."}
{"text":"i love this place we been eating here for over 10 years we eat the same dish all the time. dry shrimp chow fun beef broccoli five flavor shrimp with head chicken teriyaki  sweet and sour pork and ofcourse egg rolls thank you for the best food and very affordable."}
{"text":"Great food, try the rice noodle dishes and ask for it \"dry\".  Also, the lemongrass scallops are fantastic.  They obviously don't care a bit about the decor, and you'll feel like you've walked into someone's ratty old apartment, but this is one of those rare cases when the food makes up for it.  The menu is a bit intimidating - it has 15-20 pages of dishes, but they staff is willing to help you make up your mind.  Some things not to try (I've been here several times, and not every menu item is good) - the 5 flavor squid has a creepy salty/sugary thing going on, and the sweet/sour pork is a little too dry and salty.  Everything else so far has been great."}
{"text":"I have been coming here regularly for the last four years and I don't know why it has taken me so long to write a review. GHHK fills an important niche in midtown, there is no razzle dazzle here, this is not PF Chang, GHHK is like an eatery you can find in any respectable Chinatown, and since Phoenix does not have a Chinatown, this is about as close as you will get.. I don't know any restaurant that can serve lunch faster than the Gourmet House, even when it comes to large groups. The ambiance is very casual and there is no dreaded fluorescent lighting which instantly creates a relaxing environment. The waitstaff is very friendly, prices very reasonable and the food is several steps above average. Check out their seasonal specials like the medicine soup (does not taste like medicine) in the winter and fresh mangoes with sweet sticky rice in the summer.  I don't know what I would do if this place ever went out of business,"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled - the place looks condemned from the outside - however the food is great!!! The inside is OK. I will come here again. Be sure to clarify your order after you make it. Otherwise the service was super. The portion size was average so if you are hungry order the \"big plate.\" The soda was flat this visit but they substituted another drink."}
{"text":"I really should not enjoy bashing a Phoenician dynasty in the opening lines of this review, but what the heck, PF CHANGS SUCKS.  Yes, I said it, Its garbage.  Its a semi formal dining hall serving bland white meat chicken in a variety of sweet and sour sauces.  Restaurants like PF Changs exist, so that people don't have to motivate their taste buds to explore further reaching foods, especially Asian cuisine.    Then there is the Gourmet House of Hong Kong, masked in an entire ideology against Chain/Bad Chinese restaurants.  To say this is a \"hole in the wall\", would be an understatement of epic proportions.  Found on the corner of right around 10th street and McDowell, this inconspicuous dining hall stands, ready to show anyone who will listen, what true Cantonese cooking is.   Upon entering, do not be scared. No, it is not travertine tile, elaborate fish tanks, black napkins and the playmates of the month serving you your food.  Yes, that is really just a plain circle table with a white paper napkin and some soy sauce and chili oil containers. Yes, the restaurant is old and beaten up.  Yes, that is the smell of fish in the air, do not worry, in around three visits you will be swooning for that sweet aroma to come to your table.  Now lets talk about what matters.  THE FOOD.  Hands down, the best noodles in Arizona.  I recommend the shrimp chow mein.  It is a bed of soft egg noodles, crunchy on top with at least a dozen U-20 size shrimp and baby bok choy resting on a delicious sauce.  I could have this dish by itself every other night of the week and for ten dollars, I might as well.  The wor wonton soup is a deep flavorful broth, filled with not just one piece of broccoli and a few wontons, but swimming with shrimp, beef, chicken, vegetables and wontons.  The crispy dry noodles are a great accompaniment to the soup and are always on the house.  Want to try something different? How about a \"scramble with shrimp\".  This is just as it sounds, a Cantonese variation of egg foo young, that is a medium bed of fluffy scrambled egg with shrimp and green onion mixed in, just phenomenal.  Right now they are serving 1.5-2 pound lobsters for eighteen dollars. That's a ridiculously great deal for such a large lobster. They will make it any way you want, I recommend steamed with black bean sauce and green peppers.    I could go on and on and about this place, but I will stop here.  Let it be said though, if you are looking for atmosphere or a contemporary hip restaurant, this is not your place. If you are looking to get down and dirty and eat some real Cantonese cuisine, you will not find a better place in the valley."}
{"text":"Yes, the restaurant has been around for more than 3 decades and the building does show it. But the fact that it remains on the scene shows that it has staying power, and for a few good reasons. The food is tasty and very inexpensive - this is one of the best dining deals in the city, price-wise. The service I've experienced here is friendly and fast. And there's free WiFi; I love having long, leisurely lunches here while browsing the web. Parking is never a problem, and the location is convenient."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds more of Hong Kong (where I lived for a couple of years as a college exchange student many years ago) than any place in Arizona.  The atmosphere is definitely not upscale (more like some of the Long Wongs in PHX), and may be a bit of a culture shock to some, which is why I don't recommend it for everyone (4 instead of 5 stars).  The food, however, is very authentic, though they don't always have the exact ingredients that you would find in Hong Kong.  The dry flat rice noodles (ho fun) is among my all-time favorite Hong Kong dishes, and this place does it right. The clay pot dishes are also worth a try - really good. (Among the Chinese restaurants that I have tried in Phoenix, the Gourmet House of Hong Kong is #2.  Number 1 is the Great Wall, which I review elsewhere.)"}
{"text":"I had food to go from here in the past but I finally actually had the opportunity to eat here the other day. When you first walk in you find yourself wondering if you accidentally went in the wrong door as the kitchen is right there. We were seated quickly and the dining area was bright and clean. The lunch specials are quite reasonably priced so we ordered the sesame chicken and spicy garlic chicken combo plates. I did not care for the soup they give you. It was just flavorless broth with cabbage in my opinion. I would have preferred not and sour or egg drop soup. The egg roll however was pretty darn good. The combo also came with a chicken cream cheese puff that was tasty. My sesame chicken was a bit sweet but good. It also seemed just a tad overlooked. My dining partners spicy garlic chicken lacked spice so he had to doctor it up to get it to his liking.   This place is definitely worth checking out for a quick and affordable lunch."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. I love the \"Hong Kong\" style pan fried crispy noodles!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to eat here but then was a bit let down.  The fountain when you walk in is nice but the rest of the restaurant is pretty run down.  Service was efficient but not very friendly.  Food was the biggest disappointment.  Ordered: Vegetable Spring Rolls - cheap, came with two small ones, my youngest was happy Beef Lo Mein - beef had pretty good flavor and texture, good dish Vegetable Mu Shu - worst flavor of Mu Shu ever had Vegetable Egg Fu Young - over fried and not that tasty.  I would not choose to go back."}
{"text":"Well worth the $. We will definitely come back. The only reason we didnt rate it at 5 stars is because of location and outside appearance, but the inside was clean and had a nice set up. When you first walk in you wonder what you got yourself into as the kitchen is right in the front. The food was delicious. We ordered Honey Walnut Shrimp, Beef Teriyaki, fried rice, egg drop soup and Crab Puffs and 2 iced teas. Everything tastes great! Our bill came out to $36.00. Be back again with the rest of our family! E&O"}
{"text":"Lunch is down to a science here. No waiting for a seat, If you know what you want you can order quickly, your included soup comes seconds later and the meal along with the check only a few minutes follow. Perfect for a fast sit down lunch.   the lunch menu is quite cheap $5-7 and for 1.50 more they will give you a egg roll and crab puff, however most skip this option. I enjoy the vegetarian options. There is the monk style vegetables with tofu in a light sauce. Pad tai with tofu, and two fish options and a vegetable fried rice. If you like it hot every table has a container of crushed red pepper in oil, it adds a real flavor punch to any meal. Most meals come with seamed rice and for .50 extra you can get brown or fried rice.   There is a refrigeration full of many exotic beverages both alcoholic and non however I have yet to try any of them. The outside may scare some away however the inside is decent and the chairs are from a old coffee shop.   Great for a lunch the food is decent and the options are nice if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Ekkk! We went here after reading great reviews and seeing that it was one of The Arizona Republic's top 10 chinese spots in the Valley.  Nothing was good, I'm sad to report. The sweet and sour soup had such an odd overly bitter taste, it really wasn't edible. I ordered their version of Happy Family and the \"spicy brown sauce\" was watery, sweet and made the veggies soggy. My husband ordered the bell pepper chicken, which was just OK.  We got our order to go, otherwise I would have sent the soup and my dish back. And maybe would have had a different experience...  We've had such a hard time finding a good traditional chinese place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good fast food chinese food at it's best. Nothing special but was our go to spot for 3 years. House fried rice and orange chicken always hit the spot. Never ate inside, just did carry out and was always quick, and polite service."}
{"text":"Mu Shu was closed so we gave this place a try for takeout. Sundays and Asian food, I know. I'm Asian.  Currently suffering worst food poisoning in this decade, the kind that tears your back up from violent heaving.  Don't get chicken."}
{"text":"I have to say i am very impressed with the food and the service. It is some of the best Chinese food i have tasted in a long time. I can not wait to try the rest of there menu. I especially look forward to trying there duck..."}
{"text":"After a few recommendations, I finally paid a visit to this restaurant.  I'm glad I did because it was really great!  The building isn't the nicest but the food certainly makes up for it.  I ordered a few dishes for our family.  The Beef Chow Fun was my favorite.  This noodle dish has really great flavor.  We also ordered the Mongolian beef and Chicken with Garlic sauce; both were fantastic!  Our last dish that we ordered was the Green Curry with Chicken.  This was also good, a little spicy and a little sweet.  Overall, our meal was really good and we will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I tried Gourmet House of Hong Kong today with a group of co-workers. I'll admit I may be a bit jaded as I would have preferred a place with a patio to take in this beautiful day, but whatever.  Yes the decor sucks, it's dark inside, and the restaurant is laid out weird...but it's those things that give this place it's charm.  The menu is huge...potentially the largest menu I have seen at a Chinese restaurant.  Service was quick and we had ordered, ate and had the check in like 30 minutes. Of course, since we were in no rush to go back to the office, we sat around and talked for another 35 minutes.  The lunch specials are cheap. Like $5 or under cheap. The portions are also a reasonable size, so it's a good deal for $5.  The corn soup was...interesting to say the least. Not something that I enjoyed at all.  I had the cashew chicken as my meal (it's not on the lunch special menu)...large portion, tender chicken, and lots of cashews. I didn't care for the light sauce very much actually and was disappointed when there were no green peppers in the dish. Also, the carrots tasted a bit off to me.  My co-workers all enjoyed their dishes, which included sweet and sour chicken and peking duck.  The bill for the five of us (including tip) was $40. So an awesome deal, considering two people can't even eat at TGI Friday's for $40 anymore.  Can't say I will be running back to Gourmet House of Hong Kong, but not a place I would avoid either."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST when it comes to authentic cuisine. This place ain't for the light of stomach, as the kitchen is located in the middle and you can smell what's cooking. The first place I've had so many exotic dishes, and didn't have to travel much to eat those dishes!  Don't care for the decor, but seems like decorating and ambiance is not high on their list. If you just want some 'Chinese-inspired' dishes, go to China Panda. If you want to know what shark fin soup actually tastes like, then go to the Gourmet House. Don't waste your time in ordering mundane dishes, this is more an adventure than anything."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Had the sesame chicken lunch combo and did not like it at all.  The soup if a veggie and if you want egg drop it's a $1.00 more, the fried rice has nothing fried it's just yellow rice.  The chicken was hard and the sauce wasn't good.  It was just not a good experience."}
{"text":"Wow what a awesome place to eat. Excellent prices the portions are enough for leftovers for the next day. The orange chicken was to die for. Wife had teriyaki chicken said it was the most tender and juicy she has had in a long time  Aunt and uncle had combos and loved the soups and cheese puffs  Not a single complaint"}
{"text":"Gourmet House of Hong Kong has a lot going for it-  friendly staff, unpretentious atmosphere, central Phoenix location, a thick menu... However, my first visit there was kind of disappointing.  Admittedly, I had high expectations walking in, after reading this place had been voted \"best Chinese\" in Phoenix at some point.  I have been to many wonderful authentic Chinese restaurants in the Chinatowns of Boston and New York.  How did the Gourmet House rate?  My three star vote is a balance of my first experience eating there and the eager smile I had after leaving- and wanting to try again soon.  Sound a little confusing?  Well I think of it this way:  I place blame on the so-so dinner with perhaps our poor menu selections.  We chose generic potstickers, wunan beef (super greasy and not spicy as the menu promised), lemongrass chicken (there must have been some misunderstanding, for we were served some kind of lemon chicken, definitely not lemongrass) and plain fried rice (forgettable).  This place is much too likeable for me to stay away.  I can't wait to dive head-first into that long menu and try something a little more exotic.  My kind of place.  I'll let you know what happens."}
{"text":"A beam of light in an area which has seen better days. Bars on windows are common here. The restaurant would never make the cover of any foodie magazine but, the food is great, there's plenty of it and it's cheap! It's a no brainer. Had lunch here recently and the lunch menu prices would amaze! $5.39 for just about everything on the lunch menu. You can't beat that! I had the mongolian beef with fried rice and an egg roll all of which was wonderful. Could not possibly finish it all. The service was top notch. Very helpful and patient. When you want a good meal at a great price, keep this place in mind. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"My favorite wings in Arizona is gourmet house of hong kongs five spice wings. They are dry rub and perfect. Chinese food is good too. Use to work over by here years ago and every chance I get I stop by for their wings."}
{"text":"I crave this place, I dream of their Peking Duck. Better than sex, well maybe not better, but a close runner up. Went here with J.W. and a number of other friends for my birthday; great fun, fantastic food! Don't let the hoody decor scare you off, experience the Gourmet House!"}
{"text":"Things to order that you might not normally order - but should.  Ask what chinese greens they have. They usually have a bunch that aren't on the menu.  Order steamed with garlic. Chinese broccoli, ong choi, gai choi, bok choi are my faves. Order with black mushroom if you're feeling freaky.  The \"casserole\" menu is chinese hot pot. The taro one is great. My favorite is the fish filet and tofu. I order it with sauteed, not deep fried, fish, and soft, not deep fried tofu.   The fish fillet and green onion is superb.  On the thai menu, the papaya salad is the bomb.  The frog legs are pretty good! :)  The noodle soups are great. So is the congee, if you're into that.  Try some of the more exotic stuff on their menu. That's where they really shine the most."}
{"text":"Like other users mention, this place is in a strange location. Barred windows line the streets and dodgy neighborhoods encircle it, but the food is not to be missed. Not to mention the lunch special is definitely the best priced meal pound for pound in the entire city.  Unlike most American-Chinese places, you don't have to order the chicken to have a good time. Squid, fish, some weird beef intestinal lining thing, whatever; enjoy your meal and bring an empty, empty stomach."}
{"text":"Delicious food and awesome proportions! The veggies are fresh and not stewed down to mush! The building is a bit odd and dated but dont be deceived! Also, the customer service was excellent. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quick, cheap Chinese food. Don't get your hopes up for \"real Chinese\", but it's fine in a bind."}
{"text":"*sigh   Another place that used to be the best in town, and is now an embarrassment.   Food off the Chinese menu is still good, but the regular menu is no longer up to snuff. Sauces that were once delicate and light are now weighted down with starch and made unbearable with sugar. I went with about 6 other people and the only dishes we enjoyed were some pan fried noodles, and some stir fried greens. I don't even know what the greens were... maybe snow pea leaves... but they were good. Still 2 out of the 10 dishes we ordered isn't a good record."}
{"text":"I know this place got a few nasty reviews, but I think they probably went in for the lunch, which unfortunately isn't as awesome as their dinner. The dinner is consistently delicious, the egg rolls are obviously made there and not frozen. Last time we went there we got the cashew chicken (amazing) and the sweet and sour chicken (pretty good) along with egg drop soup which is great too. They don't use msg, and one of the waitresses even took the time to talk to us for a while, they're always pretty nice. It may look like a hole in the wall, but those seem to be the best places to get a good plate of Chinese food."}
{"text":"Gourmet House of Hong Kong has rolled out a Thai menu. I'm not sure what this means yet, but I'm going to find out."}
{"text":"I would like to make my rating based on three things: Food quality, customer service and consistency. I've tried MANY asian food establishments here in the valley since moving here three years ago and this is by far the best I've had! I usually order To Go and my food is always ready before I get there and am greeted with a kind hello and an appreciative smile (how nice!). I've ordered from them many times and have been impressed everytime. Thank you for the great food!!"}
{"text":"They offer an extensive menu of typical Chinese American restaurant selections, but also several dishes not often found in most restaurants, including several specialty noodles, soups and seafood items.   At times, they also have some Thai dishes.  They have several Lunch Specials for around $5 and quick service to go or dine in."}
{"text":"Really like the dry sauteed soy sauce bean sprout chow fun noodles.  I get take out here 2- 3 times a month -  have not eaten in.  The staff is friendly, helpful, food appears fresh and is ready to go in a heart beat.  It's rather lame they now charge extra for brown rice.  I go here mostly for the noodles, the tofu dishes I've had have been merely ok.  My partner enjoys the sweet and sour pork and kung pao chicken.  If I could do 1/2 stars, I would give Hong Kong House 3 1/2 stars overall - for this review, 3 is too harsh - so 5 stars for the noodles and fast service and the convenience."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Arizona. I highly recommend the Mogolian Beef, Steamed Fish with garlic and ginger, and the Twice Cooked Chicken. Their Hot 'n Sour soup is the best you'll ever taste."}
{"text":"The food was as good as we have had here for delivery, BUT.....why do these restaurant advertise the \"pancakes\" with the mu shu or the peking duck and when all they are only CHEAP tortillias. Really ticks me off. Just say tortilias and not try to scam with the \"pancake\" stuff. how dishonest. I am calling all you Chinese, Japanese restaurants out, is there any of you out there that make the real \"pancakes\" Lazy, lazy, lazy, cheap, cheap, cheap. And the sweet and sour sauce out of a bottle, probably CISCO. Throw in some pineapple, onion and a few green pepper in a cheap red sauce."}
{"text":"Lali, skip this review.  Crikey, this was something out of a Seinfeld episode.  Should have known better, the place was virtually empty on a Friday night except for a wild-eyed dude in a wifebeater. I was told this was THE place to go for Peking Duck.  No no no, I am still having nightmares about it.   It had been frozen, nuked, and maybe even frozen and nuked a second and third time.  It was dry and chewy, and lacked any of the usual delicious qualities of Duck.  The Mu Shu Shrimp was no better.  The sauce very thick and syrup-sweet, the pancakes dry. The curry noodles were a starchy mess, and had been doused in an exorbitant amount of curry powder.  Even the rice was off. Yikes!   I feel guilty giving the poor review because they are local and family-owned, but the truth must be told!  Maybe an off night but I won't be back to find out!"}
{"text":"Egg drop soup is AWESOME! Best in Phoenix. Now the crab puffs had nothing but cream cheese...I literally broke it open to search for the meat and I didn't find any so that was very disappointing. I had the house plate for my entrée. The taste was ok... But what really killed it for me was the texture... It felt as though the ingredients had been soaking in a pot for 4 days... It was soooo slimy... I couldn't eat it... So I just enjoyed my fried rice and egg drop soup... I would come here again only for the soup.... And I wouldn't go out of my way to make it here."}
{"text":"um. not great. i ordered the chicken lo mein and the crab puffs - and well, was a bit bored. the decor is shady. and to be perfectly honest, if i'm going to eat chinese it should taste good - greasy and with a ridiculous calorie count but good."}
{"text":"Food was Great, perfect amount for lunch, cost was perfect also. Staff was friendly, polite, courteous, patient, & helpful"}
{"text":"I suppose if there is one benefit to being single and typically eating alone, it is that you can try new, perhaps more obscure restaurants without worrying about poisoning your date. For lunch I set out to find a restaurant on McDowell. The neighborhood looked a little sketchy and the parking was minimal. I pulled in a lot which turned out to be the incorrect parking for the place I was visiting. Maybe it was a sign because the other place appeared to be closed, so I headed back toward the car and noticed I was in the parking lot for The Gourmet House of Hong Kong. I was hungry and I like Chinese, so why not?   The place didn't look that big on the outside, but it was very spacious inside. You walk in through the kitchen and the staff takes you into a large dining room. I also liked the chairs- a wooden chair with a cut-out design of a steaming cup of coffee...or maybe that is hot tea...either way it was cool. Speaking of large, the menu was expansive. A lunch time menu had a good selection of food for about $4.50 each. The regular menu was over 10 pages and as I flipped through and saw squid, live lobster, duck, frog legs and other things I didn't want, I became worried again that it might in fact be more than I hoped for.  I settled with the Kung Pao Chicken which came with steam rice. I added egg drop soup and the waitress asked if I wanted an egg roll. I then bumped up to the lunch plate that included the entrée, rice, egg roll and to my surprise a hidden fried rangoon. The soup came out almost immediately. First sight told me this was a hearty soup - I took a sample and YUM! Good broth, good egg and a ton of veggies - celery, mushrooms, onion and snow peas filled the bowl making it filling even for a small.   The food came less than 5 minutes later. The Kung Pao was loaded down with onions, green peppers and lots of peanuts. The sauce was sweet and not overpowering, but there was a subtle kick to it. The egg roll was good, as was the sweet and sour sauce. The mustard sauce was very strong and one taste opened my nostrils. The total was $6.08 for the plate, $1.69 for the small soup.   I stumbled upon this place by accident, but I am glad I found it. That and the sign on the inside proclaiming an award for Best Chinese by New Times Magazine (couldn't see the year) said I will be back next time I am looking for some Chinese close to the office."}
{"text":"THE BEST of Phoenix... outstanding hot and sour soup.  Also try the Sadha Squid Chow Mein with pan fried noodles.  They decor is amusing at best, but it's the food you go here for.  Better yet, you can now finally have a beer with your meal!  Great place."}
{"text":"There was a time when this place was decent even if never great, but it was cheap and the vibe was cool.  But now the dinner menu prices are what you might pay at much nicer Chinese restaurants, and the TV on in the dining area only reinforces the impression that some bad decisions have been made."}
{"text":"Hot and sour soup had a gallon of vinegar Mongolian beef had a pound of sugar  Gross, gross, gross. Thank god we only stopped by while road tripping..   Ick  Update: im close to throwing up from that gross taste of sugary (whatever the hell they used in that \"mongolian beef\" sauce). Seriously it was chunks of leathery meat swimming (really) in gross brown syrupy sauce. With several pathetic pieces of onions. Thats it, folks. Thats mongolian beef for the ghetto house of hong kong.  This is not chinese food. No, this should not even be food."}
{"text":"Adam M. was absolutely right: The Chinese Broccoli in Garlic Sauce and the Mixed Seafood Hot Pot (Casserole) are really, really amazing! I've also become a big fan of the Tomato Sauce Shrimp - tastes nothing like what you're thinking.   Eat these items we recommend or be seriously disappointed trying the chinese staples you've become brainwashed into enjoying elsewhere."}
{"text":"Gourmet House of Hong Kong changed ownership a few years back.  Michael and his lovely wife are no longer involved, but the new owners retained the same cooks.  The food has always been very good, and little was lost in the transition.    We once tried the typical Americanized dishes (sweet and sour pork, lemon chicken, etc.) and weren't too impressed.  We don't order that style of food anymore.    We never go for lunch.  We like the dinner menu, and prefer to eat \"family style\", with the various dishes on a lazy susan in the middle of the round tables.    Lots of Asian families are eating there, especially on weekends, so you know the place is going to have good, authentic Hong Kong style food.  We tend to order these dishes most often:  Hot and Sour Soup  Green Pepper Beef w/ Black Bean Sauce (over crispy chow mein noodles) Hunan Beef Kung Pao Chicken or Shrimp Mu Shu Pork  The Hot and Sour Soup is always good, and at times it is excellent.  We do see some variation in flavor, but we always start our meal with it.  Even on an \"off day\" it is still good.  You hit the Hot and Sour Soup JACKPOT when it has that perfect balance of heat (from black pepper) and dark vinegar, along with the meats and veggies.  I tend to discern Chinese restaurants by their Hot and Sour Soup, and this version rarely disappoints.  The Green Pepper Beef w/ Black Bean Sauce (over crispy chow mein noodles) is so good!  I could eat it every day for a month and not get tired of it.  If you like black beans in your Chinese food, you'll love this dish.  The Hunan Beef is a dish I don't find anywhere else.  It is what I think is their \"take\" on twice-cooked beef.  It is strips of tenderized beef, cut thin, that has been dredged in cornstarch and deep fried.  Then they stir-fry it with a dark, pungent, spicy sauce that has both sweetness and a sour tang.  It is strongly flavored, and quite satisfying.  The Kung Pao is standard, but very good.  Hot.  Pungent.  Exactly as it should be.  The Mu Shu Pork is excellent, and, as other reviewers have indicated, the pancakes are spread with plum sauce and filled at your table by the server.  They use a spoon and a set of chopsticks quite adroitly, so they never touch the food with their hands.  Very fun.    Those are our favorites.  We've been going to Gourmet House of Hong Kong since the early 90's, and it is still one of our favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"i like going to this place and have been going for years. proportions and prices have changed but its still worth checking out. hope you enjoy. by the way i think they have the best chicken fried rice here"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Did not have high hopes given location and outside appearance, but the food is quite good.  I have ordered a few items from this place now and have had pretty good experiences with them all.  Definitely a go-to for take out Chinese and it's relatively close too!"}
{"text":"I\"m a fan, I like it I love it I'll eat more of it.  This place has the biggest duck menu I have seen.  If you want to put a Chinese restaurant to the test try their Peking Duck.    What Can I say Price is Important This is not a $5.00 all you can eat, but the lunch menu give a great value. For under $8.00 you can get a large meal.    I like the servers they are short to speak but know their menu and everything is prepared with speed.  This location has its slow times, but if you look close its a big restaurant and even has a back room.    My fav I would say the Egg fu Young brings me back, it must be the gravy."}
{"text":"I only ever do this place for take out when I'm in the area, or if I'm looking for something special like congee. If you have not had congee yet, do it. It's awesome rice porridge. (Don't do the thousand-year-old egg though, it is interesting, but not nearly as awesome.)   I had my hopes high after hearing so many good things from long term Phoenicians in the valley that love, love, love this place. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Or just kinda settled.   And you know what, it's okay to settle some nights of the week.   Not every night can be a mighty! flavor! explosion! If that was the case then Pei Wei and Panda Express would have gone out of business years ago. Fuck it. I'm giving an extra star out just for not being a tepid commercialized variation of salty brown sauce plus rice. In yo' face, Pan-Asian corporate \"cuisine.\"   The prices are right, the food is piping hot, and the menu is extensive. A perfectly adequate option for Chinese take-out."}
{"text":"we went for Easter Sunday...had a group of us...family and friends.  Ordered in stages...some appetisers first, then 4 of the entrees...once those came we ordered the rest.  Worked out well.  Service was good, and everyone enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Not impressed whatsoever. Everything here tasted a little off, and it was very expensive. I've been here twice and my favorite thing in Chinese restaurants is hot and sour soup. Gourmet House of Hong Kong's hot and sour soup is an abortion. The ingredients in the soup are weird looking, the shrimp are little brine shrimp looking things about the size of a pencil eraser, and the taste of the soup is really gross. It's sweet and kind of tastes like bad faucet water.  As for the main dishes, they lack taste. My Kung Pao Chicken was completely bland, and this is supposed to be a spicy dish! For Chinese food this place is pretty gross, and I'm surprised at how many people love it. I guess there is no accounting for taste, which most folks apparently don't have."}
{"text":"Well to tell you every time I come here is amazingly awesome, never had a problem with there food or service. People just need to chill with the bad reviews.  Also not just the food is great but their deserts are delicious! Mango with white rice and cream is a must try!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place weekly in 2006 and found the food to be excellent.  Went there yesterday before my flight and was severely disappointed even after ordering 5 different items.  I don't know if my taste buds have matured or if they have changed cooks."}
{"text":"I lived here years ago and have eaten at Gourmet House of Hong Kong and I remember enjoying it.  I re-read reviews before I ordered it again (after 3 years) and got hot and sour soup, mu shu pork, and the dry sautee chow fun with chicken.  The soup wasn't great, not bad, but not the best Hot and sour soup I've had.  The mu shu pork was the strangest flavor and consistency.  Almost sweet and creamy, which mu shu pork should NOT be.  Then the chow fun also had a really off flavor, and the chicken was super dry.  I'm quite disappointed and sorry that I spent over $30 on this meal that left me quite unsatisfied.  What happened Gourmet House of Hong Kong?!?!"}
{"text":"If you can look past the giant Meth billboard right outside and the general uncleanliness of the entire establishment, it's pretty wonderful... especially if your intentions involve eating a whole lobster, like myself.  Gourmet House of Hong Kong has the cheapest whole lobster dishes I've ever found, anywhere. I don't mean a measly, mid-western, tourist trap restaurant kind of lobster, I mean a damn good, meaty, savory, juicy morsel of deliciousness.  It's served a number of ways, but I usually go for the black bean sauce style. Then, I eat like nobody's watching, vow to never let my boyfriend see me like this, and usually end up getting sauce on my face, clothing, table, neighbors, etc. Go messy, or go home."}
{"text":"Just got take home from here. Best food I have in a while that I did not cook myself. Staff was pleasant and had food ready before they said they would under fifteen minutes. I will tell everyone that is looking for Chinese to go here. Next time I go out I'll be there to eat in the patio I spied when walking in."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the exterior - this place is one of the best kept secrets in Phoenix.  The family that runs it provides great service and prices. Decor is simple.  Make sure to try the hot and sour soup and the Mongolian Beef."}
{"text":"I am going to start off by saying I am an egg roll snob and they got 4 stars alone on that yum! The location is a Little scary I'm not gonna lie but once you get in it is very cute. The service was great I was a little nervous when we walked in and no one Else was there I had the sweet and Sour chicken and my boyfriend had the Duck, My chicken was very tasty as far as the duck the skin was good and crispy but to greasy for the actual meat and would not really recommend that but the egg rolls and sweet and sour sauce were out of this world I can't wait to go back again..."}
{"text":"Great authentic Hong Kong food.  I don't like all of the food they serve, but the stuff I order is the exceptional.  This is one of those \"hole in the wall\" places with great food. I highly recommend the Chow Fun, the Hunan Beef, ginger and green onion snapper (fried)...  This is one of my favorite spots.   Updated:  We have been visiting this place once or twice a week and we are still loving it.  I just added sesame chicken to the rotation and it is also amazing.  We love this place."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for years and finally decided to give it a try. The place is nothing fancy, but they had a pretty good menu selection. I ordered the sampler platter and teriyaki chicken. The sampler platter had a lot of food but was a pretty random selection (like fried chicken). The teriyaki didn't look that appetizing but tasted pretty good. Overall, not the best food I've ever had, but for the price pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad. The Lo Mein was starchy and gummy, the chicken tasted like Mcnuggets, and the sauce tasted like oil, sugar, and salt-and nothing else. Mom's dish was just as bad. Her chicken was rock hard, her brown rice was over cooked AND old...and we arrived there only 20 minutes after they opened. Disgusting. The people are nice I guess, but if the food sucks, who cares ?"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for years and drove right by this place. I found by my GPS. LOL. Exterior doesn't stand out, small parking lot and the interior is rather dark. My daughter and I ordered the egg rolls, cheese puffs and terriyaki chicken appetizers. I was pleasantly surprised at how fast all the food arrived. The appetizers were very good! We then ordered the shrimp egg foo young and it was also very good. The portions were generous and we ended up taking all home."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed this place and liked their soups and egg rolls. They serve at least one alcohol free beer. If you like you're welcome to talk to the chef."}
{"text":"There are only two reasons I usually go to Gourmet House of Hong Kong--I need cheap, fast Chinese Food that's not packaged in a panda logo and I want a place where actual Chinese  people are behind the counter. The food isn't bad. It's what you'd expect in a Cantonese style place. But whatever I order seems boring and uninspired. Last time I had chicken and vegetables (really weren't many veggies) and a side of fried rice. I was disappointed that it was just white rice with bits of egg. I thought there would at least be some onion or scallion. And the rice still tasted more steamed than fried. I think they are playing loosely with the definition of fried rice. Anyway, I was glad last year that they fixed up the decor. The peeling paint on the outside did not do much to whet the appetite."}
{"text":"Everyone was very nice here, but oh boy. Hot and sour soup is my favorite soup and I have a forgiving tongue for the varieties that chinese restaurants offer, but this was the worst. Downright horrendous. Just tasted like a TON of vinegar without any quality or flavor. I forced five spoonfuls and then could not continue... the fried rice was also the worst I have had. You really can't afford to have bad rice as a Chinese restaurant, but without a doubt, this was the worst. I want to say some nice things, but all I can really say is avoid at all costs. :("}
{"text":"This is my uncle's favorite Chinese place in Phoenix...and I have no idea why.  It's a little junk Chinese food spot...but it begs the question: \"Isn't Junk Chinese at least supposed to taste good?\"  I mean, I know what I'm putting into my body isn't actually good for me, but Gourmet House of Hong Kong makes the act of eating it not even pleasurable...so what exactly is the point?  The spot isn't very clean (the bathroom=complete ew).  The noodles are gummy, the tofu is rubbery...The sweet and sour sauce was kind of good, but I think it added to my stomach ache (which began mid meal).  The crunchy things they'll give you if you ask--those are good.  Crunchy things and a semi-doable sweet and sour do not a restaurant going experience make."}
{"text":"i don't understand why this place always gets such good reviews everywhere. i guess the fact that it's not panda express or pei wei gets it some bonus points but honestly the food isn't that great."}
{"text":"greatly enjoyed the inexpensive lunch menu.. fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"FOOD: Mediocre, Menu is pretty extensive for a small Chinese Joint, basic Lunch menu for under $6.  I typically come here with my co-workers and we do it family style.  SERVICE: Mediocre, not too much too complain about, generally nice when ordering  AMBIANCE: Dive (x3) inside and out, same goes for the parking lot.  While its a pretty small place, they do have tables that can accommodate a group of 12.  CONCLUSION: While the FOOD and SERVICE is a respectable 3 and 1/2 stars, the overall dingy appearance inside and out brings it down to a 2-star.  I have noticed a bug crawl up one of the picture frames one time in the dining room.  I have not been back since."}
