{"text":"Toronto's first cider house and what a house! Brickworks Cider has always been a pretty face at brew festivals, on LCBO shelves and now on location in the east end! 

I came here for an afternoon flight of cider before hitting a concert in the area. Perfect spot! It was sunny out and the place wasn't too busy, so we got a table right away. The service was super friendly and easy with our time crunch to get to the show on time. 

When the mood struck, we ordered two flights of cider. It feels very generous! Between the two of us, we got to try nearly everything on the menu because a flight gets you four samples each. It was presented very beautifully, in a labelled beer trough with branded mason jar glasses. Also! We had a delightfully cheesy, spinach and artichoke dip and that was pull apart fun."}
{"text":"Came here on the night of the ice storm for my girlfriends Bday, originally we were a group of 17 but that dropped to 9 and they were very accommodating. I stuck to beer but most of our group dove into the huge cider selection. There are a lot of different types that are not available in stores... we want to go back to try a batch that was fermenting. The food was awesome! I got the chicken Schnitzel and it was amazing! All in all the staff at the ciderhouse when above and beyond for us all night and made it a birthday to remember. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday evening with colleagues for a work celebration, and the wait time was only 15 minutes. As soon as we entered this place, I was impressed by the expansive restaurant and high ceilings. You can choose to be seated on the first or second floor - we chose second floor for a bit of a quieter atmosphere. The ciders on tap at the bar are totally Instagrammable, and everything looks very clean, professional, and enticing. 

Each of us ordered a flight deck of ciders (4 5oz pours for $6!). Make sure to call ahead if you want a specific cider, as three of them weren't available when we went! I got the Queen street 501 (traditional apple cider, semi sweet), the Stadium Island Peach, the Hawaii 5, and the Guest Tap. I absolutely loved the first two ciders, which were both semi-sweet and reminded me of drinking Somersby. The Hawaii 5 was totally disgusting - it tasted sort of like warm pineapple juice, but at that point I'd rather just drink regular juice. Finally, the Guest Tap was really a matter of controversy at our table - some of us loved the strong bodied taste, while I found it too boozy tasting for my liking. One sip in and I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it.

For food, I ordered the rigatoni without chorizo (server was able to add extra pasta and cheese to compensate for the lack of meat in my dish). What I loved most about the menu here is that each entree comes with advice for what cider pairing would go best with it! Though my rigatoni was pretty mediocre, I learned that it paired best with the mint&basil cider, and my server happily swapped out my Guest tap for the herbaceous mint&basil cider. 

Overall, this place provides a really great space to catch up with friends or colleagues, while enjoying a slightly more upscale meal and expansive cider options! The only thing I would change next time is to order off their sharing platters (think tabouleh hummus, mussel frites, baked Brie, etc) rather than their entrees."}
{"text":"My 3rd time here already and I'm pretty impressed. Super friendly and helpful staff, cider is delicious, and they have a great wine selection. Menu looks delicious so I'm looking forward to trying everything. Tried the fries as a snack and they were spot on. Great addition to the new east end entertainment corner."}
{"text":"ave you been to the Brickworks Ciderhouse yet? I've been a couple times and boy, was it tasty! The high ceilings and plethora of windows make this space inviting and spacious. There are 2 levels and an open concept kitchen. Yes, I know this is a Labatt owned company, but that's not its fault and it doesn't make the cider less tasty.  

In my couple visits there, the service was on point. It's a busy place, so sometimes patience is needed, but you did not feel forgotten! My visits occurred in the first 2 months of opening; so fresh!

y first visit consisted of a flight of cider and fries. First off, the fries are good, but the curry ketchup it comes with is SO GOOD. If you're looking for a little something to snack on with cider, this is a great, shareable option. On the flight side, there were a few ciders I hadn't tried and I was curious. One is the ciders was Mint & Basil....weird, right? Not weird at all actually. It smells like basil, immediately making me crave pizza, but it tastes like heaven. More savoury than sweet, this cider is super refreshing and begs to be drank on a patio. This one was definitely my favourite of the 4. The Peach Cider was the runnerup, but the Mint & Basil had my top spot! 

The second visit was a large brunch date; there were 14 of us. We had a nice big table on the second floor. Everyone enjoyed the food and cider; even the coffee was good! The only complaint was with the Eggs Benedict. It's a staple for brunch and you've gotta get it right. About half the group ordered it, but most of the eggs were hard boiled; only 2 people received a runny egg. One person sent theirs back and I don't blame them. As a brunch addict, I'm hoping by now they've got their Eggs Benny together! Can always ask the people how they'd like their eggs, that way everyone is happy!

It's a great space and I hope they get the food more consistent as they are still pretty new. I'd still go back to try more of their food. Watching the plates come out of the kitchen makes me want to go back!"}

One trip = 1 star; second trip = 3 star : average 2 stars.

First trip (1 star):
Three of us showed up at 1030 pm on Saturday, March 10.  There was lots of empty tables.  Host told us there would be a thirty minute to 45 minute wait.  We said that's fine, and asked if we could wait at the bar (which also had space).  He said no, we weren't allowed to wait at the bar.  He said he'd take his number and text us when a space became free.  (I'd like to add we are three industry-professionals in our late 20s/early thirties who were dressed very nicely. The company we work for actually carries Brickworks Cider, although I have advised them to stop carrying it)  He never text us.  I wrote them and let them know that was really disappointed and confused by this experience.  They never wrote me back.  They clearly don't give a F.

Second trip (three stars):
At least this time we got in, but the host situation was not much better.  I returned on Saturday March 17, just a week later. There was one couple ahead of us, and when we went to the host she quoted us 20 minutes \"to clear some tables\".  At that point, the couple ahead of us said they were going to leave because they didn't want to wait.  (N.B. this host said we could wait at the bar)  Just as they walked out, the server came back and was ready for the next table of two...which was us, since that other couple left.  So the quote time of 20 minutes was actually 20 seconds.  Very odd.

I don't know if this was our server's first job ever, but when she came over she just stood at the end of the table staring at us, and we had to say hi, and then she said, \"I forgot what I'm supposed to say.\"  She continued to just come over and stand at the edge of the table and stare at us the whole time, though.  

We shared a cider flight - all apple ciders, disappointingly, and the flavoured ones tasted almost artificially flavoured.  We ordered baked brie, which was meh (HOW CAN YOU MESS UP BAKED BRIE) and pork  belly ribs, which I think were just pork ribs, and were also meh.  For better beer: go to Blood Brothers.  For better food: go to Godspeed.

A cute idea for a place, but terrible execution and the owners clearly don't care."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday morning for brunch with my friends. I got their eggs benedict are really enjoyed it! They had hashbrowns as a side and they were really well seasoned and crisp. My friends got the burger, but found that the meat was a little overdone. You could tell that it was dry. 

Also shared a flight. I don't remember all of the ones I got except Cuppa - an Apple Cider with Earl Grey, Lemon, and Honey. I remember this one because I really didn't like it. I don't know what it was about it, but I think once the Earl Grey flavour kicks in, the cider doesn't taste great. 

Definitely would come again though. Really enjoyed the place and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Could've been a two star review if I only had tasted brunch on my visit, but fortunately I shared fish and chips with my wife which helped bump up the experience.

It's a nice space with about as much natural light as you can have. It's two stories tall, and right on the corner of Broadview and Queen, with windows all along the 2 sides of the restaurant facing the streets. 

They were very busy for brunch, but seemed to be fairly well staffed to manage it.

My wife and I decided to split our dishes, so we were both able to have the eggs benny with pork belly, and the other dish being the fish and chips.

The big flaw was the eggs benny. The eggs were cooked hard, as were virtually everyone else's at our large table - apart from one person. We told the server, and he came back with two poached eggs...which were both as hard as the first ones. On the third try, the eggs came out right, but it was far too long into the meal to salvage the experience. Apart from that mistake, the pork belly was over cooked and too lean in comparison to virtually any other pork belly I've had.

The fish was really good however and a nice batter. The fries were shoestring cut, which isn't my preference, but they were served fresh.

I think that they may be fairly new, and hopefully they can improve the quality of consistency of what's coming from the kitchen, as it is a nice spot."}
{"text":"Our first time here! I really liked the cider from this company so we were psyched to see what the restaurant and brewery were like! We had the schnitzel, mussel frites and a flight of beers. The service was really great even though we were on the upper level! 

Chicken schnitzel: This seemed to be the most popular meal in the restaurant, for good reason! The schnitzel was perfectly breaded and the gravy was so unique, I felt like I could taste a hint of Apple, but it really worked well to balance out the usual saltiness of the dish!  

Mussel frites: This was honestly the most disappointing part of our visit. The mussels were in a very basic tomatoe sauce, and were passable. They were Okay but there was nothing really unique about them and I wouldn't get them again. For starters though, the bread bowl looked really good from where we were sitting! 

BEERS!!!: THE MOST IMPORTANT PART! : Our server was actually super helpful with our selection, and since the mint basil wasn't up to standard we got the Hawaii (pineapple) queen street 501, raspberry and peach. The worst was the raspberry because it was far too tart and sour. But the best was the queen street 501: That's what I think the perfect cider tastes like: a little tart, plant sweet, but not in a fake way, like you're drinking the essence of a bushel full of apples 

So although the mussels were a bit disappointing, I rated this so highly because I see the potential of great service and drinks, and I can't wait to come again and try different things!!!"}
{"text":"Actually more a 2.5 star review. 


Service: way too slow. We got seated at a table, and it took over 10 mins to even get any type of service. Server didn't come by table, until we flagged down hostess to ask who our server was. Didn't get any water or anything till almost 20 mins after seating. This was an early Sunday evening. They weren't fully packed or anything. Service did get better after that. When our food was taking too long, server did come by to explain and offer us discount. 

Kitchen: was super super slow that days took almost 45mins before we got served any type of food. We ordered apps and mains, and they just came out all together. 
We had ordered 2 burgers, my brothers came out first, I had to wait almost 10 mins for mine. So the rest of my table was eating before I even got anything. 

TheIr explanation was their kitchen staff was new and training. I completely understand that, but they should have told us at beginning of meal, and not after
We're super annoyed already. You could tell other tables in restaurant were annoyed too. The servers were all hoovering by kitchen waiting for food, instead of going explaining to their customers. 


Food: certain dishes are better than others. The Korean wings were delicious. Nice and crispy with a good spice and kick to the wings. 
Fries at good and crispy. Nicely seasoned: 
House burger was bit too greasy for my liking. It tasted great, but there was oil dripping out every time I picked it up. 


Drinks: dill pickle Caesar was amazing. Salty and sweet. Would defiantly get that again. Want to try their ciders too: 


Overall: MEH. I'd like to try it again later on once they've figure out their service staff and kitchen staff problems. I feel that they have potential to be a great restaurant, just not there yet. Lots of improvements to be made first."}
{"text":"They change their taps often and one of the menu items listed wasn't on the tap. Nonetheless, several options to choose from and they're all pretty refreshing. The cider pours are a good amount. It is, however, very loud (music) in the place and made it difficult to have a conversation across a table. Seating for small parties is generally quick. They have food selection as well, but we didn't have any. Would recommend the cider."}
{"text":"It was 3pm on a Monday, about 1 month after they had opened.

Hostess was nice and offered us a table, but we just went and sat at the bar. (Great spot to see all the cider tap selections).

There were two of us. My friend got a cider flight. 1 cherry 2 honey 3 raspberry 4 ginger peach - cherry was good, as usual. honey tasted like well water from a farm. raspberry was very sour, but good in the end. ginger peach was just OK. I've had many of their standard ones before Queen Street, Batch 1904 and Peach and those are all great, so maybe get two classics and two new ones to try if you get a flight, so you aren't disappointed. The mint-basil wasn't available that day, but I hear it's quite good.

The bartender didn't bring us waters until after the second time we asked for them...after our food had arrived. He wasn't particularly friendly, but he did the standard check in when we got our food...which was bad.

We shared the pulled pork poutine and the ciderhouse salad. They both sounded great on the menu, but they both were quite mediocre. For starters, the poutine was not hot, it was hardly even warm. The cheese curds weren't melted because the fries weren't hot at all. The pulled pork was lukewarm and not particularly flavourful. The salad was boring and looked like a pre-made salad you could get at a grocery store salad bar, definitely not worth the $14. These were both a disappointment. The kitchen could've made more of an effort, it's not like they were busy (we were 2 of the 10 people in the restaurant, so it was pure laziness). I would not order those menu items again. 

I think because it's only been about a month for this establishment, that they still have some kinks to work out. The atmosphere and the layout of the place are quite nice, so let's hope they can bring the staff and the quality of their food to that level. 

I will give this place another try in the future, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Queen E is starting to come alive!  This new cider house is a great addition to the neighbourhood.

Went to brunch here a few weeks ago and got a lovely table on the 2nd floor (highly recommend the top floor).  You get a nice view and i don't believe it is as hot up here as it is on the first floor.  This place has large windows but no window coverings and I think the windows aren't double glazed...so all that sun..streaming directly into the place...and onto you...makes it HOT IN HERE (and not in a good way).  Dress light...lol

I had the fried chicken sandwich and it was pretty good - a good size of chicken with \"spicy\" mayo.  It could have been spicier but that's my personal preference.  The server asked if i wanted fries or the slaw so I went with the slaw,  I didn't realize afterwards, when i got my bill, they charged me for the side of slaw ($3).  Not particularly impressed b/c I was under the impression that I got a choice of side with the sandwich.  Perhaps a misunderstanding on my part.  Also, could have sworn the menu showed the sandwich was $16, but was charged $17 (my friend also commented on this so i know it wasn't only me that thought there was a price mix up).  I didn't try any of their ciders, but several people did and quite enjoyed them.  

If I was in the area I might stop in for a drink at the bar.  It's a huge space but it fills up fast - loud, noisy, fun!"}
{"text":"Food: 1/5
Drinks: 3/5
Service: 1/5

If you choose to go to Brickworks Cider House, I would only recommend going for the drinks. I would not come here for the food. 

Came for brunch on Sunday with a friend. The space is beautiful - floor to ceiling windows, lots of light, high ceilings, and a buzzy industrial vibe. It's very spacious and has two levels. We were seated on the second floor balcony and were able to see into the restaurant down below.

We each ordered the simple breakfast ($14) - my friend ordered over-easy eggs, which were fine, while I ordered poached eggs. The kitchen doesn't know how to do poached eggs. The centres were NOT RUNNY - they were solid! I could even see a border of fully cooked yolk. One of my eggs was shaped like a little log, actually, and had a chunk of solid egg white running through the middle. I'm pretty sure that egg broke while in the boiling water, and I think they tried to rescue it but failed. I was not impressed. The sausage and bacon were fine. Pretty standard, nothing to be too excited about. I liked the toast - it was a multi-grain toast with sunflower seeds embedded in the crust, and the strawberry jam added a sweet touch. I'm pretty sure the hash browns were frozen, machine made and merely tossed into the deep fryer. However, it was a bad fry job - there was a pool of oil on the plate and when I bit into the hash brown, I could taste the grease. I will give them credit for serving 2 decent sized hash browns instead of 1.

We each ordered a flight of ciders ($16 for 4, 5 oz each). My favourite was the peach cider, with the cherry cider a close second. Hawaii 5 was not bad, though I felt it could have had more pineapple flavour. My friend really enjoyed the mint basil cider, though I personally hated it (it's very herbal-y). We both agreed that the raspberry cider was a bad choice - it's dry, watery, and SOUR! It needs some sweetness to balance it out. We wanted to try the wild honey cider, but it wasn't available that day.

The service was not great. Our server was extremely abrupt and disgrunted - not sure if he was having a bad day or just not a morning person. He didn't smile or make us feel welcome, didn't even say, \"Hi, how are you?\" After taking our orders, he left and then returned shortly after, saying, \"Who ordered 3,5,9,7?\" No context, nothing. We were confused and slightly taken aback. Apparently, he wanted to verify our cider orders (each cider is numbered on their menu). He could have communicated it more clearly and nicely to us, e.g. \"Hi there, can I quickly re-confirm your drink orders to ensure I have them correct? Who ordered XYZ ciders?\"

The place had a great vibe but the food and service really left us desiring more. Quite a disappointment."}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem while staying in Leslieville.  This review is based only on beverages as we were coming back from dinner when we decided to stop for drinks.  The space is big and open and bright with a lofted dinning space over the main room.  There is a big glass roll up door at the front of the building that was open as it was a nice evening.  It really creates a large space that is very airy.  Unfortunately like most high ceiling rooms it is LOUD.  This is a consistent downside to me for every establishment with this design.  The sound travels throughout the space and ultimately ends up with me not staying very long.  That is my only negative and the reason for the scoring down of one star.  The ciders are delicious! We sat at the bar and did a flight of 4 ciders but I believe there were 8 or more to chose from.  My favorite was the peach but honestly they were all fantastic if you like cider.  Each is crisp and then has it's own unique twist.  Some are tart, some sweet, some dry and really in short there is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I have a few things to say about this place, but before I begin I will say that it had only officially been opened for 2 weeks before I set foot in there, so being fairly new, there were and still are obviously some kinks that need working out...

So, my boyfriend and I walked in just after 7 p.m. on a Wednesday night. The Leafs game was into its 1st period and showing bright and friendly up front and centre behind the bar. I immediately liked the vibe of the place, with its open space concept, high ceilings, and simple decor. A nice new addition to the neighbourhood.

Unfortunately, it started to go downhill from there...

We stood at the entrance waiting for someone to seat (or at the very least, acknowledge?!?) us and I found it weird that there was a young female who sat these two gentlemen who had walked in riiiiight before us but then didn't seem to feel the need to come back to her post to tend to the next customers--us.

While we were waiting, I happened to put my hand on one of the two tables that were at the entrance...just to lean on, and imagine my surprise when it started to roll away. If I hadn't caught my balance, then it would have been a silly little accident. I would just err on the side of caution if I were the establishment. Why put a table on WHEELS near the entrance, what if a less able person were to feel tired and think it was sturdy then lean on it and fall? 

Anyway.

My boyfriend took the initiative to find some seats at the bar, where we would have liked to sit regardless of table availability (it WAS pretty busy, unsurprisingly). There was one seat in the middle of the (long) bar area, plus another one near the end. If my math is correct, that'd be TWO seats available--just required a little bit of shuffling around. NO problem, because this is Canada and we are a friendly, open nation, right?

Nope.

While my boyfriend went and got the stool at the end of the bar, I stood in the spot in the MIDDLE of the bar (between two different parties of people) where he was planning on bringing the seat (yes, again, where were the people who worked here who were willing to help us? Or stop us from doing this at all, if it was a problem?) CLEARLY looking for some space to sit down, and it was appalling because nobody seemed to care or notice...not the patrons, not the staff. I told my boyfriend that we should actually move this stool from the middle of the bar to the end and so he came and got the chair and moved it down.

In this time, I asked the bartender (who just stood there looking helpless--actually, while we were doing this he ran to the entrance to help two NEW customers who had shown up...where was he when we were standing there???) why he wasn't asking people to shuffle down, and he seemed flustered. I don't want to fault him for this because I can understand it has probably been a crazy 2 weeks, but THEN he said something that I disagree with: \"I don't want to interrupt those two ladies, they're having a conversation.\"

Really? Two words: \"Excuse. Me.\" 

While I was getting frustrated with this guy, my boyfriend had successfully squished the two stools together at the end of the bar and walked over to the two women who, this entire time, had just been sitting there (clearly aware of our presence and need to sit down) talking the entire time, ignoring us. He asked them if they would mind moving over and they just stared at him like deer in headlights.

The couple next to them also didn't take any initiative to move over.

Thankfully, a man at the VERY end of the bar said he was leaving and when he did, that freed up enough space.

The bartender apologized to us but we could honestly not understand why he would use this pair of ladies engaged in conversation as an excuse not to politely ask them to shuffle down to make space for other patrons?!? Clearly, Brickworks would like our business, no?!? There was enough space at the bar, just not two spaces TOGETHER.

It was a very awkward and disappointing start to our experience there. THANKFULLY the ciders were quite interesting to taste (the bartender comped us our taster flight which was nice of him to do) and the hummus dish was delicious.

I'm just writing this so that management can speak to their staff about paying closer attention to the basic needs of customers. This is a great neighbourhood with lots of establishments that have loyal customers. We like to go out IN this neighbourhood because it IS our neighbourhood and are HAPPY to have something like Brickworks open up!!! Just please, next time anyone comes in, make sure to greet them and make space for them. The more, the merrier. If other people aren't willing to do it, then at least...make us feel at home so we'll come back :)

THANK YOU."}
{"text":"With so many breweries popping up all over town, this is a refreshing change from the usual options. They have a large selection of ciders to choose from, majority of them made onsite and a couple external guest taps. Also, they provide a good selection of food items. The space is bright and airy, with a wall of windows that let in plenty of light. I would recommend sitting on the second floor where it's less busy. 

We had a flight of ciders (four 5oz pours for $16) with brunch and it was a perfect way to spend a Saturday afternoon. We tried the Queen Street 101, Hawaii 5 Eh!, To Bee Or Not To Be, and the guest tap Winter Bliss. Each had it's own flavor profile, with my preference being Winter Bliss.  I had the fried chicken sandwich for brunch, which was absolutely delicious. The chicken is crunchy and moist, with a drizzle of honey which amped it to the next level. A solid recommendation!"}
{"text":"Before my visit, the only cider I was familiar with and absolutely loved was Somersby. This  is a great place to explore other original ciders through their Flight Deck Deal. I got to try a variety of ciders including Queen Street, Mint&Basil, Framboise, and Guest Tap which ranged from semi dry to dry, 20oz in total volume. For $16, I was amazed by the quality and distinctiveness of each cider. Personally, my palette favoured the original semi-dry ciders like the Batch. If you give each flight a try, you'll find a reason to love it one way or another with some time(with the exception of the Hawaiian that tasted like forgotten pineapple juice) 

Kevin served us for the evening. He was very accommodating. He informed us of missing flights (cider choices) early in the meal. Towards the end, I wanted to try the Batch to which Kevin graciously offered us a suitable sample. It turned out to be one of my favourites and one of the reasons I would come back. Note that if you're not particularly happy with one of your choices, they do allow you to switch to another cider.

The food options are quite pricey but I was impressed by the tenderness of the pork chop and how the acidity of the sauce combined the entire dish. The food menu is definitely worth a try but I forecast myself ordering more share items in my subsequent visits.  

This was a great visit. Looking forward to visit again!"}
{"text":"Below average food.  Kitchen a mess.  Slow service and it looked like there was a water fight in the bathroom.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - 5/5, it's more of a sit down place, as opposed to \"Let's meet at the bar\" type spot.  Open, loft-style, renovations look great!  It was a full house on a Sunday afternoon.

Service - 4-4.5/5 by Kevin.  He made some suggestions for my flight, but I really didn't like one of them.  I mentioned it to our server when he came by and he promptly switched it out.

3 out of the 4 drinks in the flight were in the wrong spot though!  Not his fault, but obviously a mix up behind the bar.

Food - Maybe a 2.5/5 for brunch.  Servings looked uber greasy with that unmistakable sheen of oil.  I ordered the Chilaquiles.  Eggs were a bit too runny, fried corn tortillas were tasteless and oily, and I didn't like their choice to put goat cheese in the dish.  Coriander was limp and uninspired, no red onions in sight.  Salsa was Old El Paso which is a pet peeve because pico de gallo isn't that difficult nor does it take long to make.  Guac was a weird creamy short-cut of some sort.  Everything tasted ok, but I had a \"reaction\" when I got home.  Let's just say it was a combo of #1 + a #2. 

Go for drinks!  But I'd skip the food, especially anything fried until they learn how to drain the greasy first before serving!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Brickworks Cider, so I was thrilled to find out they were opening their very own space in Riverdale. The new cider house is two floors of absolute delight. 

I had my visit on the weekend during their brunch service. When I arrived, the place wasn't too busy. But within 20-30 minutes of sitting down with my guest, the entire place was packed. Surprisingly, the services didn't lack whatsoever. Our server stopped by our table multiple times to check in on us, ask us if we needed more drinks, wanted to make sure our food was OK, etc. I was super impressed with just how on top of it these folks were. 

The cider list (we were provided) wasn't up to date which was kind of a bummer. When we arrived, two or three of the ciders were out plus the guest taps had changed over. But either way, we were able to order a flight which was delightful. Best $16 spent and a great way to try everything they have on hand. 

The food menu isn't too expansive at this point. We had ordered hummus ($13) as an appetizer and while it was super tasty, they only gave you two large pitas. The hummus to pita ratio was not really on par. For our mains, I ended up ordering their Fried Chicken Sandwich with a side kale caesar salad. The chicken sandwich toppings were great, but I would have loved a thicker, juicier chicken cut for the sandwich. My friend ordered the avocado toast (on the brunch menu) and it came with two hashbrowns akin to McDonald's hashbrowns. She wasn't a fan, but I ate them and they were tasty as heck.

The space is filled with so much natural light that it might it great for food photos. The pacing of food and drinks was perfect as well, as made this a great time to catch up with friends. Overall, would totally check out again sometime I'm in the East end."}
{"text":"Brickworks cider house is right at Queen and Broadview. It is a black building with a small sign, I missed it the first time I walked by it. The servers were friendly, the place is nice and spacious and sunny. I prefer the upstairs area it is quiter and you can have a conversation.
The ciders were good! I thought I didn't like cider until I tried the cherry cider and mint basil cider.
I still prefer beer, but the cider is worth a try even if you arent a fan.
The food was okay. I came here with a large group on Sunday and four of us got the eggs benedict.
Only my one egg wasn't overdone. All the rest had hard yolks.
The eggs benny came with pork belly and hollandaise sauce with sriracha.
In theory, it sounded dope, in reality, the sriracha really took away from the hollandaise sauce and I didn't care for it very much.
That being said, the rest of my food was yummy. I would visit here again with friends."}
{"text":"This place seemed cool but the service was really bad. I wouldn't go back just based on that. The food wasn't great and he cider was just ok."}
{"text":"I like the vibe of this place. My friends all did the cider sampler and they really enjoyed it. I tried the cider house salad and it was good. The poutine is pretty bomb too, wish there were more fries to balance the pulled pork ratio. Service was good but sometimes difficult to get attention because the place is packed. Their apple pie is delicious (house made!)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is right on Queen St. and entrance is accessible. It has a modern decor. I wish they would post more information about their food menu on their website and not just their drinks. I took my friend here for her birthday. My friend drinks, I don't, and I was worried about the food options.

I was relieved to find that they do have a food, your standard Canadiana pub options. We had to sit at a communal table because they had a lot of reservations that night, so make a reservation. I had the Brickworks burger, it was good. The great service stands out more to me, though, than my meal."}
{"text":"I gotta admit I was getting a little miffed with this place because I've tried to go a couple times and haven't been able to get in because of the crowds. As a local, I suppose I felt unreasonably entitled. Yesterday I gave it another go and the third time was certainly the charm. My friend and I pulled up at our very high table and ordered what we saw being delivered to another table. Holy Mother Mary! Yum! I started with a Batch cider and had the mussels in blue cheese sauce with frites. It was one of the most delicious things I have eaten in a long time. It was so good, I am rather bashful about admitting this, that I used a spoon to demolish ALL the sauce! And the frites were so spot on that we ordered more to share. This experience was made even better by the friendly staff working there. They seemed authenically pleased that we enjoyed ourselves so much. The only thing possible I can say against this place other than the wait if you come at a busy time, is the noise level. The decor is fresh and lovely, but all the hard surfaces and the high ceiling really amplify and echo all sounds. So go knowing it won't be some tranquil dinning experience, but the nosh is top notch. I will for sure come back soon!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the hood! After a long reno the Cider House is the newest and a very welcome addition to the Queen and Broadview intersection.  Barely resembling the old dingy Irish Pub, this bright and airy space is going to become a fan fave.  I had two of the 8 craft brewed ciders... and I'm not even a fan of cider.  Try the one that is a mash-up of a cider and mojito!  We didn't eat but I was tempted to steal off every plate that went by.  The staff was friendly and clearly excited to share the experience with the customers!  Hit this up!"}
{"text":"When next looking for something delicious in the easy East, I will definitely return to Brickworks Cider House! Sweet staff, sweeter snacks and the sweetest cider. 

I popped into BCH with a colleague before a work event and we each had a cider flight. I'm not a huge cider drinker, but I really enjoyed all of the different flavour options. I especially liked their Hawaiian pineapple infused offering. Delish. 

Along with our ciders we also shared an artichoke dip bread bowl thing. A loaf of crispy, cheesy bread that you tear apart filled with green goodness. It's definitely a full day's calories... but it's worth it."}
{"text":"another successfully BLOGTO.com recommendation! 
we have a new entry into my personal top ten of Toronto, read below how this restaurant blew my mind!
back in February I was on the blogto website, as I am on daily and I saw the headline, \"Toronto is getting its first urban cider house\" I clicked the link and was pleasantly surprised to see the details, a cider house on queen street and in the same neighborhood as the opera house?!?!!!(a venue I frequent often times a year) I was sold!. 
yesterday I was able to come to this location for some dinner before a show, because of timing restraints it was sadly not able to happen until last night. I walked into the restaurant and was instantly impressed, this location is super bright, open, and clean. as soon as I got through the second set of doors, I was greeted instantly, the waitress told me she had to clean up a couple of tables before I could be sat down to eat, I came on my own just a bit of context, as well I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar, which I politely declined. while the waitress went to prepare a couple of tables, I was really taken back by the size and the space of it all, to put it into words the restaurant would be comparable to a loft, lower seating, kitchen and bar area, and a upper area with seating only. within two minutes I was told to come to my table and of course it was upstairs. I get seated and I was taking in the atmosphere, music playing, a lot of talking, and the air inside the restaurant was very crisp, kudos to the hvac system they have in place cause the restaurant felt extremely comfortable and refreshing. I placed my order after looking at all of the options on the menu, and its very hard to chose given all the options. TABBOULEH HUMMUS Chickpea, mint, EVOO(extra-virgin olive oil for those who don't know), crushed chili, naan bread, cucumber $13.00 and POUTINE Cider-braised pulled pork, pork gravy demi-glaze, cheese curds $12.00. as well for my main I ordered RIGATONI Chorizo, tomato sauce, roasted red pepper, shaved Parmesan, sage $18.00. I couldn't help but notice all of the people and what they were ordering, cider flights, wine, other awesome food options like PAN SEARED PICKEREL, PAN ROASTED, CIDER-BRINED PORK CHOP and CHICKEN SCHNITZEL. everything looked and smelled fantastic, which only drove my hunger into overtime and overdrive, and after a morning and afternoon of chores, the sooner the better! my app's came within about ten minutes of ordering which was super impressive, the poutine was steaming so I decided to dive into the Hummus. I can truthfully say I was a bit worried about the addition of mint to my hummus, but it was a refreshing addition to it, the Naan bread that came with it was piping hot which made things interesting with loading the bread with the hummus. Delicious! my only recommendation is that the restaurant serve it with two pieces of naan bread, cause I had a good portion of hummus left over! the poutine was absolutely out of this world and I am a poutine Fiend, for those who have seen the movie ratatouille and the part when the critique had the plate of ratatouille and instantly was brought back to his childhood memories, don't know how or why, but that's exactly what the gravy on this poutine did to me, memories of summers at my grandmothers came rushing into my head, an amazing balance of poutine with the pulled pork was worth every penny! after I finished both of these app's I was left in an emotional euphoria awaiting my main course, within about five minutes of that my main was brought to me, and I requested some additional cracked pepper. the flavors in this pasta dish was mind blowingly great, from the noodles perfectly cooked, to the spicy chorizo, the red peppers and the sauce...AMAZING! my only recommendation to the restaurant would be to add bread to this dish cause that sauce needs to be eaten. after demolishing that bowl of carb heaven I asked for the dessert menu, only to be slightly disappointed, only two dessert options? I went with classic apple pie with ice cream on the side, with this amazing choice in menu options the dessert held up on its on to give a nessicary KO to my stomach and hunger, perfect apples, perfect sauce, the ice cream was a great addition as well. I kindly requested my bill and proceeded to pay and left a very full and happy person to my concert. 
honestly I'm still riding the high of coming here almost 24 hours later. 

great atmosphere, great food/flavors, decent prices and great service
