{"text":"This is the most awful pizza I've ever eaten. The sauce is sour and the crust was WAY over cooked. This is not the experience that you want to have when looking for a good pizza place.  Just look at the burnt gross pictures they have on here.  Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Burnt cheese on the ends, pickled jalapenos and extra sauce.  Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Michigan & Trumbull is legit. I will preface this by admitting I had never had a Detroit-style pizza before my visit tonight to M&T at Federal Galley. I do fancy myself a pizza enthusiast, however, and this place reminded me why. The dough is light, airy and succulent. The flavors were on point. That by itself would be enough for a return visit, but to top it off, Kristin (of Kristin and Nate, proprietors and chefs of M&T) is the bees knees. She schooled me on what makes a good Detroit-style pizza, and honestly a good pizza period. We shared stories on dough experiments and I left with a hunger to make more pizza at home. And to return to Michigan & Trumbull - because there isn't much better than good pizza coupled with good people."}
{"text":"I'm so relieved to not have to rely on just Little Caesars detroit-style pizza (which is surprisingly good, but, it's Little Caesars). I went with the Packard Pepperoni pizza that was absolutely delicious - the mixture of crispy pepperoni, sweetness from the honey, and acidity from the peppers worked wonders together.   The pizza itself was perfectly cooked, and the sauce and cheese paired together beautifully. The chef (owner?) was nice enough to stop by after we finished eating which we appreciated as well."}
{"text":"Believe The Hype! These are great pizzas!  Tiny Human and I hit the Children's Museum with The New Frank Sinatra, Chicken Nugget & Hippy Baby. After 2.5 hours with most of the children of Pittsburgh (as it was a rainy day & where else should small villagers go?!) we decided to cut out and walk over to Federal Galley!  I'd been social media lusting after this pizza & I figured tiny human would have many choices to pick from with the 4 different kitchens.  To my delight we both voted for pizza! And it was worth the calories! Deep dish, perfect dough & crisp sides. Inventive vegan selection! Kid loved it!!!  Come try!!!   Love you! Muah"}
{"text":"Amazing New style of  Pizza! so lucky to have it in Pittsburgh PA. The crunchy crust and charred bits of cheese are a foodies dream come true...."}
{"text":"We visited for lunch and absolutely loved it!  We went with the arugula salad and the Packard pizza.  The lemon dressing gave such a great balance to the peppery arugula.  The pizza was phenomenal!  The hot honey was such a great addition.  I can't wait to come back and try other options!"}
{"text":"Related to Chicago Deep Dish. Square 8x10\", 4 slice pizzas.  One size fits all!   Sausage Pizza was surprisingly blah. Most distinctive flavor was the dollop of marinara sauce on top (though listed as a red pizza,  it isn't really).  Burned crust (apparently a Detroit thing...) No condiments provided (cheese or red pepper).  Restaurant is hidden inside the Federal Galley food court along with the Provision restaurant - no signs outside!"}
{"text":"This is the best Pizza in Pgh. Thick cut, cast iron Pizza. Very similar to Iron Born Pizza in the strip M&T is better in every way EXCEPT the sauce. Iron Born has the most amazing sauce. But the crust at M&T is insane. So stoked we have good thick pizza in the burgh."}
{"text":"I have to say that I didn't know what Detroit-style pizza was until a couple of months ago. It has quickly become a staple. M&T is my favorite Detroit-style shop in the city. There is something about that square thick dough that speaks to me on a spiritual level. I'm obsessed. I find M&T's version less salty and the dough is softer.   The first time I tried one with a white sauce and what I believe was arugula. The pizza itself was great, just too many greens. Since then I've stuck with the Packard Pepperoni. Don't be scared by \"pickled chiles.\"  They're not overly hot and the hot honey adds the perfect sweetness. It is pepperoni pizza perfection. I would love to branch out, I just love Packard so much.   Seriously, go get this pie. It is amazing.  Oh, and they now have gluten free crust!"}
{"text":"We had trouble finding this place at first, thinking it was a stand-alone restaurant. It's actually located inside the Federal Galley amongst a bar and few other eateries.  We ordered the garlic knots, the Cutch's Curtain Call (hot sausage, chilies, vodka cream sauce) and a create our own (pepperoni, fennel sausage, and ricotta). Came to about $41 without drinks.  Holy. Crap.  Worth the 40 minute drive and every cent. This had to be the best pizza I have tasted. The doughiness, the sauce, the flavors, the crispy cheesiness of the crust.. I was on a food high.   What can I do to get one of these to open up in Baltimore?!  I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh! :)"}
{"text":"Okay, Michigan & Trumbull is literally so good. You can find this new spot in Federal Galley (part of the old Allegheny Center Mall - it's location is literally in an old bank vault. How cool is that?   This shared space features other restaurants and a bar settled in the middle of the Galley, but the main event was finally getting to try M&T. We hit it up for lunch around 12:00pm - it was busy, but we didn't have to wait to order and the food was delivered about 10-15 minutes later) we also were able to grab a table right away.   I ordered the Woodward Ave White pizza - a Detroit style pizza featuring (mozzarella, ricotta, hot pepper flakes, lemon zest, and garlic oil) - this pizza was out of this world and like something I never tasted before. It was delicious. My one coworker also ordered this pizza as well.   My other coworker ordered the Bagley Chorizo (mozzarella, pickles red onion, chorizo, and cilantro ranch) - I didn't get to try it, but she loved it.   We shared an order of the Teader Fries (crispy waffle fries, bbq chip spice, and cilantro ranch) - these were some of the best \"fries\" I've ever had.   We also ordered the Garlic Knots - they are literally as big as my fist. They are the best garlic knots I've ever had.   I'm bringing all the friends and family - Michigan & Trumbull is the best."}
{"text":"This place knows how to make a good pizza. Fluffy in the middle and a crispy crust! Toppings are top notch! Sensational salads for those who aren't looking for carbs. Washing it all down with a Vernors ginger ale is the end of a perfect meal. This place the gem of a new place in the heart of the Northside."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh! Kristen is so enthusiastic and nice every time we visit,  it's definitely become a regular spot since moving here from the Detroit area."}
{"text":"So when my Girlfriend asked me how my pizza was, I had to gather myself... I didn't want to be a creature of the moment, and say something outlandish. I took a deep breath, another bite of my pepperoni pizza, and declared that it was the best that I've had in Pittsburgh... Not only do I think that this might be an understatement, it could be flat out insulting. This might be the best Pizza that I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, perfect toppings, sweet, savory, spicy. All in all, an amazing slice of Pie. I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"Delicious. This Detroit style pizza is taking Pittsburgh by storm! The burnt cheese on the crust give this pizza a unique texture and amazing twist on flavor. Don't let the pizza distract you from the BBQ waffle fries with cilantro ranch dressing. My husband had been talking about them non stop. Get there. Get the ZA. Get the fries. Be happy."}
{"text":"OMGOMGOMG.   This Detroit-style pizza is the truth.   Thick crust, bubbling, crisp cheesy edges with flavorful sauce just waiting to flow upon your first bite like the river Brittany Spears cried for Justin Timberlake...  And they've got gluten-free pizza! And it's really good!  Just keep in mind that this square pie is filling. It would have been hard for me to each an entire pizza by myself, although at first look it's not too daunting. But each slice is rich, and the crust is thick and delicious, so make sure you've brought your appetite.  I was loving the whole vibe of Federal Galley, but this place right here was my most memorable bite."}
{"text":"Awesome detroit style pizza and the staff are super nice.  Great ingredients and always great tasting. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Being originally from the Detroit area, they have truly done Pittsburgh a favor by introducing the city to this type of pizza!  They were great people and in talking my boyfriend tells them I'm from Detroit.  They came to ask how we liked our pizza and it was seriously soooo good!  The teader fries mimicked BetterMade chips.  If you're from Detroit, BetterMade chips were a food group.  They also sell Faygo & Vernors, other Detroit staples.  We just had the pepperoni pizza, but will definitely be back.  Pittburghers act like they barely know where Detroit is, but I'm glad Michigan & Trumbull are here to represent!  Oh and I love that the pizza are named for popular streets in Detroit.  Next, they need a Coney Dog pizza."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Mondays ago with my wife for dinner.  We had come to the Federal Galley as part of a wonderful Yelp event and after trying all of the restaurants decided to finish our dinner with a pizza from Michigan and Trumbull.  As with all of the restaurants in the Galley this is a walk up counter where you place your order, they give you a number and then deliver your food to you at your table.  Due to that there isn't too much to say about the \"restaurant\" itself.  They do serve Michigan style pizzas here which means that they are cooked in a cast iron type skillet which gives it a nice crust.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split the bagley chorizo.  The menu described the bagley chorizo as a pizza with mozzarella, pickled red onions, chorizo and cilantro ranch.  After only a couple of minute wait our pizza was brought out to us.  It looked delicious, especially the caramelized edges and crust but I couldn't help but wonder about it's size (4 pieces) for the $16 that it cost.  Thankfully it tasted as good as it looked as the crust had a nice and crispy exterior while the chorizo brought the spice and the pickled onions added a much appreciated hit of acidity.  Combine that with the cilantro ranch drizzle and it was a really cohesive pizza.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  Their pizza was delicious and although I am not sure it was worth the cost, I do enjoy supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"Service was good. Pizza was Detroit style which outside of little Caesar's I've never had Detroit style. Honestly if blind folded I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference"}
{"text":"Perfect crust, perfect sauce, perfect toppings. That is all you need to know! I love this pan pizza/Detroit-style pizza trend. Keep it going! I've had two different pies when I've gone to Michigan and Trumbull, one was a spicy pie with pepperoni, peppers and hot honey. The other was a chorizo pie with cilantro ranch and pickled red onion. Both were so good and the chorizo pie was really unique and perfect. I know I should branch out at Federal. Everything looks so good at all the restaurants. However, it is very hard when this pizza is so amazing!"}
{"text":"Great! I do love Federal Galley - so mostly anything out of this place is exciting to me. I've tried the pizza at Michigan & Trumbull twice and was not disappointed! The first go-round was a standard pizza (tasty and perfectly cooked) and a side of the fries they offer... with that delicious sauce... sooo. delicious.  The second round was with a group of friends. I'm not exactly sure what the name of the pizza was, but it was the one with Mikes Hot Honey on it. YES! So. Good. I loved the combination of flavors and hot honey is tasty on nearly everything - but gave a perfect sweet kick to this pizza. If you like spicy food, definitely try this one! (even though I don't know the name...)"}
{"text":"Ok.  Pittsburgh.  New pizza in the Burgh.   We all have our favorites and this is now added to my list.  This is an astonishingly awesome pizza.  Sauce is wonderful and the variety of their standard pizzas is exquisite.  Quite the treat.  Then if you want to customize, go to town and create your own.  We are currently working our way through their list and have not even had a bad bite.   Each pizza comes with the crispy cheese crust.  Yum.  I never eat the crust on pizza until now. Ok folks. Enjoy. Yum"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing!!!! I wish I lived close by to eat it everyday! It's cut into 4 slices so it's perfect for a couple of small group. It's so delicious with the crunchy cheese around the outside. The crust is light and flakey. It is simply everything! I was stuffed with just a few slices but couldn't wait to have my left overs later on"}
{"text":"The Packard Pepperoni pie is delicious. The pizza has a nicely golden brown to burnt bottom that is complimented with a light red sauce with delicious notes of hot honey on top of fresh mozzarella.   The environment of the building is great with indoor and outdoor seating. There is a large bar in the middle to meet all your beverage needs."}
{"text":"This place in # federal gallery never disappoints! Their pizzas are incredible. The crust is out-of-thisworld and the combinations of pizza they come up with are delicious."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh and I've been to a lot of places!   It's a little hard to find, but it's worth it. I have no doubt Michigan and Trumbull will be making it big in the Steel City. The four corner Detroit style pizza is unique, especially in a city that isn't known for their pizza.  The flavors are incredible! You will not be disappointed.  I also bought one to take home for dinner the next day.   Don't forget about the waffle fries and arugula salad, perfect combination with a pizza."}
{"text":"I wish you could say you get what you pay for, but sadly you don't.  Michigan & Trumbull is located in the hip Federal Galley, it is also the newest pizza place recreating the Detroit Style pizza in Pittsburgh, a trend I hope continues.  With any of these cafeteria type food digs, M&T won't wow you with customer service although everyone was friendly enough (just not enough interaction to give an impression).  The place is too pricey in my humble opinion, a 4 piece pan pizza is upwards of $18-20 and I wish I could say was worth it.   I would prefer Iron Born or Jets to the overall pizza for this style and with the heftiest price tag I will pass next time."}
{"text":"I don't trust people who don't like pizza. I love that Michigan and Trumble aren't out to reinvent the wheel. They promise good Detroit style pizza and they deliver. They actually don't literally deliver but that would be cool if they did. I always go for the white pizza. It's like a cheese overload and that hint of lemon zest though gets me every time. They also have waffle fries that are delicious with their ranch but I always feel like a glutton so I don't order both at the same time but both is good. I wish they would put the fries on the pizza so I could give them all my monies but I understand why they don't. You can't have the best of everything on one thing.  I have zero complaints about this place as they absolutely know what they're doing. I appreciate the consistency and the fact that I can't by pizza by the slice instead just buy the box and eat some for lunch, dinner and breakfast because adulthood. Also, don't forget to get a sticker on your way out. They're always rotating them and they're hilarious."}
{"text":"The white pizza was very good.  Enjoyed the thicker bread like soft crust that is crisp on the bottom and edges.  The topping of mozzarella, ricotta, red pepper flakes, lemon zest and garlic oil was evident but wish it had just a tad more garlic. You get a pie that is about 8 by 10 inches and cooked in a metal pan to make the crust crunchy.  Will definitely return some time and try another style."}
{"text":"This pizza is so good. Has a great flavor. The crust is not too soft and not to hard. I had the Woodward ave white pizza. It has mozzarella cheese ricotta cheese red pepper flakes for some spice garlic and a touch of lemon zest. No red sauce. Perfect combo. Price is t too bad either for the size. Pizzas are all shareable but if your hungry you can eat one yourself. I also had the arugula salad.  This was also so good. The House vinaigrette they use is perfect. Very light but a great taste"}
{"text":"Federal Galley spotlight-Michigan and Trumbull. Whenever I visit Federal Galley these days it's for the purpose of introducing family and friends who have never had the opportunity to experience it.  I took my daughter here today since she is a pizza lover. Catching up with their chefs- Kristen Calverley and Nate Peck,they were glad to meet her. Their recommendation to us was the Woodward Ave white pizza. This pizza comes with mozzarella, ricotta, red pepper flake, lemon zest, and olive oil.   Nate told us it is normally cut in quarters but it could be cut 6 ways if we preferred. We thought since we were sharing that 4 cuts would be enough. The size was 8x10 inch pizza.  I explained to my daughter the drill-take a number, grab your napkins, utensils, and plates from a nearby station and sit down. Federal Galley for some reason was fairly empty this visit but finding parking was nearly impossible!! Guess it all depends upon the time you go.  We got our pizza within a reasonable length of time. My daughter was thrilled to learn they put some cheese in the burnt appeared crust. With all the cheeses the two slices were quite filling. In addition you can really taste the red pepper. Good thing we had plenty of water to drink.  My daughter really liked the way it was prepared and appreciated the chef style in which it was made.  Michigan and Trumbull also serves fries, salads, and even has a brunch menu for Sats and Suns. Open daily they make a welcome addition for upscale pizza in the Pittsburgh North Side neighborhood."}
{"text":"They make a really tasty and unique style of pizza - crispy outer crust with a softer, toasty middle. I really like the twists their menu offers including daily special recipes, but they also allow you to build your own pizza if you want something more traditional. The staff was very friendly and, despite the cafeteria-esque model of Federal Galley, we felt like we had a bonafide Michigan and Trumbull experience. We will be back to try more of their delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food this joint is slinging. I mean how can you go wrong with Detroit-style pizza? And they had me at Teader Fries!  Seriously fresh and natural ingredients with flavors that really tempt the senses.  The Woodward White pizza is so damn good. Perfectly blended cheeses with lemon zest that's bold without being overpowering.  Getting the Packard on our next visit!"}
