{"text":"Burger Wass ok just nothing special. Théorêt signature pasta dish as well was just ok. Over priced for what they offer. For the same price I would go to Chase or Buca. service was extremely friendly"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place. We were looking to actually eat at El Catrin right across but the lines was wayyyyy too long. Every other restaurant had a 2 hour wait but we were lucky enough to have the owner give us a reservation later on in the night for Pure Spirits. We had to wait about half an hour past our reservation for us to prepare our tables but we were a big group and I thought it was pretty fair.   I was worried about it being pricey and it kind of is; average of about $23-25 for a pasta entree, $30-40ish for steaks, and lobster is $50. I ended up getting a funky salad with poached shrimp, chayote, chillis, etc which goes by the name of Cold Noodles. The food took about 20 minutes to come out but everyone loved their food and all the servers were kind and patient despite our large group.   I recommend this restaurant, maybe for some special occasions rather than a casual night out :)"}
{"text":"WORST restaurant experience EVER! My wife and I visited Pure Spirits for the first time with two other female friends of ours (our party consisted of 4 females, ages 25-32). We drove in from Buffalo and arrived in the Distillery District around 1:30pm. We enjoyed one beer each at the Mill Street Brewpub along with a meat and cheese platter. We then headed to Pure Spirits around 3:30pm. We were genuinely excited to try the oyster bar out! As we sat down at the bar, we were immediately impressed with Tyler, the oyster expert. He shared much of his oyster knowledge with us, and we were greatly intrigued by the oyster selection (and education provided by Tyler). We ordered a basket of sweet potato fries to accompany our oysters. The food in general was good. We closed out our $150 check and tipped an additional $80. Three of us work in the service industry as bartenders/servers, so we always appreciate a knowledgeable and friendly server like Tyler. We truly enjoyed the friendliness of the wait staff in the beginning.  After closing the tab, we put on our baseball hats and prepared to head to Rogers Center for the Blue Jays game. My wife and I (we're both women) hugged and took a photo together in the restaurant. Then, my friend and I headed outside for a cigarette. We spent about 25 minutes outside talking to other tourists before heading back in to the restaurant. The new bartender coming in (who appeared to be 13 years old) was less than pleased to be introduced to us as we ordered our second beer. Before we knew it, a server we hadn't yet seen came over to inform us that we were \"cut-off\". We laughed, thinking he was joking, but he was not. After asking to speak with the manager, she finally appeared with a large security guard in tow. The manager, Nadia, offensively accused us of being \"intoxicated\" and told us we had to leave. One could imagine our surprise. After all, we had only consumed one beer and one shot each over the span of 2 1/2 hours we spent in Pure Spirits. I could understand being asked to leave if we were vulgar and disrespectful around other patrons in the restaurant, but I can assure you this was not the case. Nadia was abrasive, offensive, ignorant, and condescending. She was rather speechless once she realized that we were actually completely coherent and quite sober. We coached her in how she could've better handled the situation and advised her she would've been wise to approach the situation like a professional instead of treating us like common criminals. I doubt such clientele would tip $80 on a $150 oyster tab.  Moral of the story: If you are ever dumb enough to patronize such a poorly managed establishment, do not order ANY alcohol! You will immediately be labeled as a belligerent troublemaker. Also, do not hug anyone of the same sex. Gays and lesbians will not be tolerated. Expect to be accused of being \"intoxicated\" (probably even if you're only drinking water) and escorted out."}
{"text":"Came here for a co workers birthday dinner with 6 people.  It's was a Sunday night - shockingly empty. The server sat us drinks everything was well. One of the girls had a shrimp allergy so she re made her caesar for her. Got a free appetizer from the website which was awesome, oysters were great, calamari was good. My friend got the pre-fix dinner and got steak, it came well done sent it back and they actually came back out and made her cut the steak in the center in front of everyone to see if it was \"well done\"  which is was! If someone asks for rare or medium rare I'm sure you should be able to tell the difference for the price she paid. Anyway they re made the steak and it was till well done so I wouldn't order that again from there lol. Also my friend with the shrimp allergy asked if she could substitute her shrimp for 2 extra scallops because she has an allergy the server said yes without informing her there was an extra charge. Of the service and atmosphere wasn't so dissappointing I would go back for the seafood for sure."}
{"text":"It was a nice summer evening when we dined at this place. This restaurant is in a interesting locale. Perfect place to sit outside and watch the pedestrian traffic in the distillery district.  As for the food nothing to write home about. Bouillabaisse was very bland and tasted more like a cold fish broth.  We ordered sticky toffee pudding for dessert and were quite disappointed.  Bread was good and the Oysters were the only saving grace for the meal."}
{"text":"After walking around most of the morning being a tourist in Toronto I decided to stop in and have a quick drink to get my energy back up.   Came across this place in the lovely Distillery District and saw \"spirits\" & \"oyster\" in the name of the place and I was sold.   It was roughly 3 in the afternoon and they were obviously pretty quiet. I was warmly greeted and sat at the bar upon my request and commenced the not so short pit stop.  The service was really good, Kevin the shucker was pretty knowledgeable on the oyster selection and recommended well. My server Victoria made me feel welcomed and was on her own, as I guess staff were cut due to it being quiet. She still had several tables and she was hustling with grace and ease and I felt like she was managing the restaurant well for the amount of people she had.  I was a solo traveling and looking for a chat, both Kevin & Victoria between their regular duties most certainly filled my requirements to just shoot the shit and give me the local insider advice about the city.  Would defiantly recommend this place and loved the staff I interacted with. My quick drink stop ended up being 3 and a bit hours long."}
{"text":"Decent service. Oysters are great. The rest of the food is hit and miss. Mostly miss. Definitely overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have never been impressed (never again).   The reason that it is an \"unfortunate place to go\" could be that it is in a tourist area and they don't think that they need to try. They aren't looking for repeat business. Perhaps Pure Spirits know that there are lots of chumps that will be wowed by their patio and get drawn in light a moth to a flame.   Food is substandard and the service is too. This place needs to really improve. It's a shame really, the only reason that I gave them two stars is because of the atmosphere.   **don't go here unless you have an expense account, lots of time and really don't care about food**"}
{"text":"Ribeye steak for me- too thin, seemed to be mediocre sourced meat. Celery root + potato puree very good.   Lobster for gf- overcooked, somewhat chewy.   Dessert was dark chocolate cheesecake with cherry, toasted coconut. Really good but a bit too sweet.   I'm being picky about the food but paying $40 an entree brings with it high expectations."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Pure Spirits Oyster House and Grill to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary with a casual Saturday lunch.  The Hostess was very friendly, and Ben was very professional, attentive, and fast. The delightful little lady server (I believe she was Fillipina) was smiling all the time.  The bread ... oh the bread ... wow!!! We enjoyed our lunch  thoroughly. The oyster poi boy was out of this world! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great looking place for seafood in the Distillery District, with a big outdoor patio to boot.  Right near the Young Centre.  Seems like a popular place for lunch.  The menu has about 10-12 selections of fish, but the burger looked good if you're not in to seadfood.  I went with the seared tuna sandwich, which was good but nothing to write home about.  The service was excellent.  Pricey, but about what you'd expect to pay for the scenic location."}
{"text":"Strawberry, goat cheese, lemon, fennel salad...maybe 1/2 a strawberry no lemon or cheese $13! Better places to eat in the distillery."}
{"text":"We went as a party of four for dinner without a reservation. The place was packed but the hostess was very nice and found a booth that could accommodate us within 15 minutes or so. We had a drink at the bar during this time.  Once we got our table, we ordered 24 assorted East Coast oysters. Personally,  I liked the ones from Martha's Vineyard best. The oysters were fresh and tasty. For the main course, I ordered sesame seed ahi tuna and it was delicious. The tuna was cooked perfectly and the side was a wasabi mashed potato which was also great. We finished things off with a cheese platter that was good but sadly didn't live up to the rest of the experience.  The food was good if a bit pricey for what you get, the service was good and accommodating and overall it was a rather pleasant experience. The atmosphere was great and the music was good. I will definitely go back at some point."}
{"text":"The place,food and service is great......one of my favourite"}
{"text":"This is more like a mini-review since we were only there for a late night dessert craving. In fact, our group of 5 had some Pinot Grigio, port, cappuccino, chocolate pieces, and crème brûlée. We managed to grab seating outside though it took the staff a few minutes to clean a table for us. Service was rapid but a bit too eager to arrive and too hasty to depart as if patience was in short supply. The prices were obviously inflated because of the setting in The Distillery, but the oysters we never ate did smell rather good. I think this is a great patio to have some food, drinks, and desserts with friends and family but there is nothing spectacular to report or rave about."}
{"text":"We had 6 people and sat at the bar since all the tables were booked with reservations. Great wine selection. We ordered 3 dozen oysters and a diver scallop between all of us. Amazing oysters and great selection! I was missing the cocktail sauce though. :( The scallop was great with an awesome pico de gallo atop. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Wow that was a bad dining experience.  We are from Toronto and used to generally good service and food.  We are not fussy diners and pretty relaxed.  We would generally avoid touristy areas like the Distillery but had to pick up our daughter nearby so decided to dine in the area. El Catrin was booked so I checked reviews and we ended up here.  Oysters were the smallest I've seen anywhere. And one oyster was bad.  Oyster condiments included straight up ketchup with a bit of horseradish masquerading as seafood sauce.  Really?  French fries were pleasantly good. But the kicker was when my son ordered dessert which arrived while our table was literally covered with dinner plates.  This has never happened before to me and I made a joke when the waitress literally put the dessert plate on top of my son's dinner plate.  There were oyster shells and condiments all over the table.  Crazy.  I think the staff is so young they have no idea of what standard, never mind good, service is.  Beware!   I read a bunch of good reviews before we ate there.  But experiencing what I did I can't imagine having a good dinner here."}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping in for oysters and drinks when I'm in the area. The atmosphere is fitting of an oyster bar. The prices are good and service was prompt. I really have no complaints about this place. Nothing over the top excites me, but I really enjoy it and highly recommend it when in the distillery district. Even if you don't like oysters, they have a nice selection of other items."}
{"text":"Great for a date night out. Very beautiful restaurant with wood flooring, wooden semi-private  booth seating and brick wall.  Ask for Ben, his french accent is the best!  Food is superb. The winterlicous menu is perfect! Salmon was cooked to perfection. The clam chowder was the perfect blend. The creme brule was amazing.   The only setback was the time it took for the main course. A little too much time between items but if you aren't in a hurry this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Only 3 tables with people and just me at the bar.  Does it really take 40 minutes to get a burger and an old fashioned?"}
{"text":"Unfortunately three friends and I were in total agreement that our Tuesday evening experience here was poor on every level. We sat inside as the patio was busy and the service to be blunt was horrible, in fact the server we were told would be arriving never came to the table until we finally got the bill. We waited too long for water, too long for our drinks, two of us ordered the chicken mac and cheese and were surprised at how bland it was for the price. Nobody checked on us at all, we had to call someone over for basic condiments, nobody cleared the plates when we had finished, we had to eventually call someone over so we could get the bill.  Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Great selection of oysters. Large mussel portion. They served at least 3 dozen mussels in 1 order. The fennel sauce was amazing! Service was great. Will come again."}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Great for oysters, halibut and their fries!! Do not go there if you are not a fan of seafood!!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, there's a warm atmosphere (lights are dim and staff are friendly). My group of 9 ordered appetizers of oysters, we each had our own main, and we all shared a dessert platter at the end. My main was the Fresh Nova Scotia Lobster Pappardelle. I have to admit, I did eat a late lunch that day so normally my appetite isn't great before eating out. However, I devoured this Pappardelle. It was absolutely delicious. Totally worth it.  Would I come back? Hell yeah"}
{"text":"The oysters were fresh, great selection and affordable; the steamed mussels with the Provencal sauce and Delicious combination of apple & blueberry pie with ice cream. Great food, atmosphere and our server was excellent.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food and quality service. The patio is lovely and so are the surroundings. Consistent and a go-to for our family for dinner or brunch!"}
{"text":"Have not been here since the place first opened, and so returning to a Sunday Brunch I was pleasantly surprised. Sat at the bar while we waited for a patio table despite plenty of inside ones. Had a special brunch menu which was reasonable in price and acceptable in quality & quantity. Service & atmosphere (weather co-operated) excellent. Will come back again one evening for dinner but it is a little bit out of the way if one does not have a car. Although a taxi is not too expensive from Yonge & Front."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had dinner here on Saturday. We were not impressed with our meal and did not have a good experience.   For appetizer, we ordered fries with a trio of dips. The portion size was very generous, but the dips themselves were nothing spectacular.   For the main course, my fiance ordered the surf and turf. Although the lobster tasted fine, his steak was cooked well done... he ordered it medium. It was very tough to eat. I ordered the yellow fin tuna and it was awful. The tuna was over seasoned (too much pepper). The accompanying sides (egg and millet hash) were the worst part of the dish. It tasted terrible. The hash tasted like bird food. I left most of my plate uneaten. When the server came by to collect our dishes, he mused that I must have over indulged on the fries appetizer that I couldn't finish my meal. I think he should have realized that given we didn't eat most of our meals (appetizer and main dish) there must have been a problem.  The chairs were very uncomfortable. They seated us in outdoor patio chairs. I can totally understand that Saturday night is one of the busiest nights for the restaurant, and they probably needed to add in additional tables to accommodate more people, but please get better chairs! Your customer's backs will thank you for it. At the end of the meal we were both so happy to be out of them.  For the amount we paid for this meal, I expected more... at least a dinner that was edible. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Four of us went in for a bottle of wine and some oysters.   Venue: beautiful interior design. Although we sat at a booth, I thought the bar looked gorgeous and very inviting. $$$$$  Oyster and Wine: Oyster from PEI... very good. Wine fine. $$$$  Service: It is very disappointing when the restaurant looks great, food was good, but the service was so-so. Our server gave out the impression that he could care less. We definitely felt he was not friendly. By the way, it was around 5 pm, so the restaurant had about 3 tables occupied and a couple of drinkers at the bar. It was not busy at all. In a nice restaurant like that, definitely a let down when the server gave out a negative vibe. The restaurant is in the distillery district where there are many other fin restaurants. I probably won't come back to this one because of the service. $$"}
{"text":"I have only had oysters here, last summer and fall when they were $1 per oyster every Tuesday. I have never came for any thing else. For oysters this place is good on Tuesdays for the $1 price. The oysters on sale are always north american and are usually malpeques. They are usually cleanly shucked. I know I can probably buy a bunch in the grocery and shuck it myself for less, but really I hate shucking oysters! I however love eating them.   The selection of oysters here is decent, not extensive by far compared to Rodneys or Oyster boy, but they are ok. Service is polite and non intrusive, but not super attentive, you do need to look for your server a bit if you like sitting in the patio."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! I found a black parasitic worm in my oyster!!! Soooooo disgusting I wanted to puke. They do not clean their oysters properly and have the worst service EVER! I am usually not one to complain but this has never happened to me and I was a little freaked out.... Seriously do not eat here!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, most often for a seat on the gorgeous (and usually packed) patio. Most recently, for a prix fixe indoors with a large group. My opinion has not changed. The location is really what this place has going for it. The food is not bad by any means, but not outstanding. Definitely pricey.   The summer times on the patio are much more memorable, but the prix fixe wasn't awful. We started with a  simple ceaser salad, my main was salmon and asian greens with house-made dumplings (really unimpressed with the sloppy dumplings)  in a broth and then a cake for dessert. It was fun, but not great value, as the $35 prixe fixe cost us $140 after two drinks each, tax and tip. Ouch.   This is definitely one of those restaurants that you look at your bill and lament about what a fantastic party you could have had at home for the same price. I could have made a better meal and had better wine for the cost.   Service inside has been great, outside not as much. I am sure I will visit again, as it is a popular spot come summer, but I wouldn't rush there by any means."}
{"text":"Went here at my mothers suggestions for a birthday lunch, I'm glad we did. Stopped in about 3:30 and the restaurant was reasonably quiet and we got seated right away. Our server came we ordered drinks and oysters with the help of his suggestions. My mom and her fried sampled the kuushi, lucky lime and malpeque oysters and were very pleased with all of them. The freshly grated horseradish and three sauces were delicious. I ordered the pure spirits pappardelle pasta with wild mushrooms and lobster, my mom and her friend ordered the lamb sandwich. Both dishes were spectacular, the pasta was flavourful and light; the lamb sandwich came with wonderful crispy fries and a salad on the side. I also ordered the Kentucky Iced tea, it was pricy but really strong so I get the price point. Our food came out quickly, our server (I think his name was lance) was charming and knew the menu very well, helping us make choices with the oysters. Our experience was lovely and if we are in the area again will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 6 stars.  The ambience of the location was amazing. Because it was the holidays - we had to wait for 90 minutes to get a table. The server was friendly. The food was delicious. I ordered the pure spirits papardelle - it was well cooked and tasted delicious. I forgot my scarf there - the server chased us down in the cold maybe a block and gave me my scarf.  The customer service at this place is top notch. I will definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"Pure Spirits was a great find that was recommend by the front desk at the Sheraton hotel. My friend and I arrived at 7:30pm on Sunday and were seated immediately since we had a reservation, though the restaurant was not fully occupied.  Our glasses were promptly filled with chilled water, and was topped up throughout the meal by our efficient, but cool waiter. The recommendation of Prince Edward Island mussels cooked in the lemongrass sauce was excellent and were served with delicious sides of garlic ciabatta bread. Warm ciabatta rolls and butter were served, which was perfect for dipping in the extra sauce.  The grilled calamari salad was fresh and tasted excellent with the balsamic dressing. The pork chop schnitzel was well-portioned and relatively lean, accompanied with a creamy risotto and autumn vegetables. Dessert was a bread pudding shared between us, which proved to be an excellent end to the meal.  Overall Pure Spirits was a fine choice and highly recommended - the food and ambiance can't be beat (we loved the music track) and pricing was par with other restaurants in the same class, with entrees generally ranging from $20-30."}
{"text":"I chose Pure Spirits for my birthday lunch. Not only was the tuna poke absolutely delicious, the staff went out of their way to make the lunch special."}
{"text":"Ordered ribeye and burger. Not bad. Friendly service. Beautiful area in distillery but food is nothing special. Buck a shuck on Tuesday was the highlight"}
{"text":"I wanted to go to the boiler house and since they are closed i decided to go to this place. When we walked in, we were greeted by server which was nice.  I ordered fish & chip and it was right and portion was good. I will go back If I go to Distillery district."}
{"text":"Came here for the second weekend in a row because we had a great first experience here. My mother who is in a wheelchair wanted to sit in a patio chair with my sister and I. The waitress would not allow for an extra chair to be brought over to accommodate for three of us to sit. She said the 2 empty chairs without a table could not be separated because no one would want to sit alone on the patio. They were rude and not willing to help to provide comfortable seating when there was more than enough chairs to accommodate others as well. After this experience I will not be going back as they do not value their customers."}
{"text":"What a great venue for the Toronto Jazz Festival!  We sat on the patio and enjoyed pickerel ceviche and traditional mussels for a perfect luncheon on Canada Day.  Very cheerful wait staff--special thanks to Emily J who advised on our menu choices and made us feel right at home!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and apps and we were seated quickly outside. We ordered the mussels and fries but substituted sweet potato fries. We also ordered a set of regular fries and sangrias. The order came pretty quickly and we started wolfing down the food. The traditional mussels were great - fresh and generous enough to share with two. The broth was good and the mussels were large. The sangrias were fruity and the regular fries were great. Nice atmosphere in the distillery district and we really enjoyed our experience!"}
{"text":"**This was our third visit.  We love the atmosphere, the staff and food.  I know some people think its a bit pedestrian but they don't screw it up.  **We started with an arugula beet salad and 2 butternut squash soup.  Beets were sweet and the peppery flavour of the arugula really mesh well, the dressing was a blue cheese of sort vinaigrette just enough to taste.  The soup was hot (i hate when you get luke warm soup)..with a hint of ginger very nice.  **We of course ordered a doz. oysters, fresh, clean, crisp, cold and tasty. love the freshly grated horseradish.  If your have oyster in your name they better be good.  **Mains were 3 hanger steaks with fries (the fries need work seem like frozen job)....steak and peppercorn sauce cooked perfect.    **Dessert - We had 1 flourless chocolate cake and pecan pie tart....nothing fancy .just what we expect (all good)  **The service is excellent from the front of the house, to your waiter, runner and even management on floor, very smooth.  **3 appts, 3 mains, 2 dessert, doz oysters, one beer, bottle sparkling water, 2 coffees + tip   $140"}
{"text":"Was sitting in the patio at Pure Spirits today for the first time. When the waiter finally came over, after about 10 mins, we were ready to order, but we're told there were absolutely no substitutions or modifications to the menu \"because the kitchen is too busy.\"  All we wanted was for them to hold the tartar sauce and coleslaw from the fish and chips because we don't eat it. The waiter confirmed it was all on the side but he had to bring it to the table.  We decided to go elsewhere.   I gave the restaurant one star because you cannot post a review without a star."}
{"text":"I hardly ever write reviews but reason why this is quite different is because I recently just got back from visiting the distillery district My visit to pure spirits was on May 20,2016. The sun was out, the weather was great. We were immediately greeted and seated right away. Our waitress/server Tori-- very prompt at taking our orders and serving our beverages. I didn't think much of it but after I finished my three (3) oysters which I waited 20minutes for she finally offered us complimentary bread which I thought was quite off because some places would offer bread bread with our beverages not 20-25 mins of already being there. She noticed I was getting inpatient she apologized for the wait I accepted..but the excuse she gave us was that..its been awhile since there's been sun out so the restaurant is trying to get back into things. Keep in mind there were so many tables still open.. I'm not from Toronto not anywhere in Canada-- but makes me think how the service will be for others during the summer time.   The 3 oysters though!! Yumm!!"}
{"text":"This is by far Toronto's best Oyster house. The service and the food quality is number one. We feel extremely welcomed every time we come here, and BEN is our favourite server. He always the best of everything in this restaurant. You must try this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Pure Spirits Oyster House & Grill, but it fell way short of expectations. Toronto is my hometown but I have moved away for a number of years now and I never explored the Distillery District until recently.   My mother and I were exploring the area looking for a suitable dining option. Being the Yelper that I am, I researched the area beforehand and had my sights on Boku for sushi. Unfortunately, Boku was closed. We wanted to dine outside and Pure Spirits had the second most appealing patio (besides El Catrin), so in we went.   We ordered the Shucker's Dozen of oysters for around $32. I think it changes on a daily/weekly basis, but we were offered 3 different types: Fanny Bay from BC, Beausoleil from New Brunswick and also Pickle Point from PEI. I tend to like West Coast oysters for their sweetness, but the New Brunswick Beausoleil oysters were actually my favorite. Out of the 3 they were the most sweet and least briny.  My mom ordered the Ontario Pickerel for $27. I tried a few bites and it was good. Crispy skin with a moist meaty interior, the fish was perfectly cooked. The accompanying tomato-based sauce was a bit on the bland side. It tasted clean and \"healthy\", but besides hints of tomato and sour from the pickled sunchoke, there was no lasting flavor. With that said, I would probably still order again.  My dish, however, was the real downfall of the dinner and the impetus for my 2-star rating. I ordered the Blackened Yellowfin Tuna for $31. I find it difficult to come up with a single good thing about the dish. I guess it can be considered \"healthy.\" However, the tuna was over-seasoned and too peppery, overpowering the taste of the tuna itself.   Another odd part of the dish was the accompanying egg sabayon. What a strange addition to a fish entree. I don't think it belongs in a fish dish. First there was way too much of it. As you can see from the photo, it occupied half the plate. Secondly, it was too sweet and tasted out of place when combined with the salt and peppery tuna. Dessert tuna...yuck.   To make things worse the \"millet hash\" (carbohydrate portion of the meal) was almost inedible. I've never had millet before, but I am almost certain it was not thoroughly cooked through. It was dry and cardboard-like. I described it as \"rabbit food\" to my mom.  Looking back, I should have probably sent the dish back (especially when it's a $31 dish). I tend to just hold it in and complain later. The service, ambiance and even the rest of the dishes were decent. My tuna dish was just so terrible that it totally destroyed my entire dinner experience. It was definitely one of the worst dishes I've ever had. I don't think I could even go back."}
{"text":"Deadly slow and poor service. Food is mediocre."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying we ended up at Pure Spirits because they have an all you can mussel special on Mondays. For an upscale resto-bar this was a great option as most distillery food spots are overpriced. We ordered a salad with some drinks along with the mussels. The portion sizes were good for the price. The think that really made this experience was the great service. My dinner mate and I split salad and they actually went to the length of diving into beautifully onto two plates. Servers were attentive enough to look after our needs without hovering. Would definitely recommend checking out the mussel evening or another night if you're up for high end pub ambiance."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. Just got back from dinner here. Had made a reservation about 6 days in advance and left a message confirming the reservation mentioning that it was my husband's birthday and that we would like a nice table outside if possible... Table was inside, service less than mediocre. Requested wine, didn't come till into main course. They did absolutely  nothing regarding the fact it was a birthday evening though other tables had singing etc. When mentioned the waitress said \"oh I didn't know, do you want some fruit or something?\" Pretty sad, especially after making a reservation so far in advance... Food greasy and borderline cold."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while at the Distillery District last weekend. The oysters were great! Highly recommend sitting by the bar and chatting up the oyster chefs. You'll get to see them open and clean out the oysters (if you find that interesting as I do)."}
{"text":"The food was good. Its my fault I didn't enjoy it more,  we had the salmon mac and cheese and the lobster pappardelle. Which tasted good, I guess we were wanting something familiar BUT I went to a oyster house and didn't have any oysters.  The restaurant was nice and the service was good. I'd definitely go again and try something new!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for lunch, and were very impressed. The service was outstanding, and the food was amazing. We started with the escargots, which were plump and flavorful. They were served with thin crisp pieces of an herbed bruschetta... we ended up using the rolls to sop up the garlic sauce. The main course was a skirt steak, served with a side of cauliflower in a cheese sauce. The steak was great -- with a very flavorful reduction sauce. The cauliflower florets were in a ramekin, covered with a very rich cheese sauce and run under the broiler to make a cheese crust. For dessert we shared the creme brulee, which was done perfectly. Service was attentive without being intrusive. The music was a little too new-agey for me, but it was easy to have a normal conversation. We didn't have any wine; the total bill (including tip) came to CAN$105, which I think was quite reasonable for the quality of the meal."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. It's nice to visit the distillery district. This restaurant has a nice atmosphere. I have 2 complaints. Salt, salt, salt! Everything I had was way too salty. I like salt but this was way over board.  I had the olive crusted chilean seabass and the cucumber and tomato salad. I only ate a few bites of each and could not continue.   My second complaint is a terrifying one. We ordered the sweet potato fries to share with our daughter who is 2. The waiter gave her the ketchup which was not ketchup. It was extra hot spicy ketchup that no one gave us any prior warning about. This pretty much ruined our experience and has traumatized our little one for a while."}
{"text":"Warm cozy atmosphere, although the tables down the middle feel cramped and vulnerable. If you can go with a 4 or less people and get a booth, that's probably most comfortable. The food was good, I had some oysters which had great accompaniments, and the mussels and fries. The fries were undercooked, which I should have sent back. However, the provincial mussels were delicious, the broth was perfect. It seems everyone else enjoyed their meals too."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for what you get here but they do have a nice outdoor seating area to lounge in.  Had the freshly shucked Oysters, fries and mussels.   Place was pretty empty while all the other were pretty busy that is why we came here so we did not have to wait 1-2 hrs for Mill st. across from Pure Spirits."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool, but the food lacks flavour and is very overpriced for the quality. Go for a drink and don't bother eating here. For Oysters go to Rodney's. I was very disappointed and won't go back."}
{"text":"Well what can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. The Oyster deal for Tuesday at 1.50 is A-ok. The ambiance is great but I guess with these two things working for them they don;t need work too hard on the other stuff. We had the prix fixe 3 courses for 35$ per person. Two of us had the Octopus Salad followed by Salmon and Sorbet to finish the meal. The salad was nicely done.  Then our mains just disappeared and I mean we had to wait for literally 45 minuted before we saw the mains. I guess they make up for it my keeping us liquored up with wine (i.e. driving up our tab IMO) which may or may not be a bad thing depending on your mood :) We were offered a free sample of beer as well. Salmon was ho hum with nothing special to speak of in terms of taste. The side of polentta was better than the main which says a lot if sides have overshadowed the main. We had the sorbets which were also very average to say the least. Final tab left a lot be desired but I guess I had good company so the evening was fun nonetheless 2 Stars for food and 3 stars for ambiance and intangibles .  2.5 stars overall when you factor in the price.  BTW the oyster accompaniments were sub-par."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business luncheon. Had the oyster special for an appetizer. Oysters were huge and fresh, came with three different sauces, I quite liked the mango sauce. Atmosphere and service were excellent.   Would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for a birthday. It was only three of us and we made a reservation. There were no problems getting in but the service was something else. We ordered at around 7:45pm and it took about 40 minutes for our food to arrive. We ordered two steaks and the burger dinner all of which were sub par. Personally for the money we paid (bill was $160 +tip) I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Walked in on a really cold Wednesday night after an event at the distillery district and had wonderful dinner. SO and I tried some fantastic oysters - malpeque, fanny bay and my fav kumamoto. Our server was very frienldy, knowledgable and helpful.  My main was a pasta with capers with tiger shrimps - sadly underwhelming. The shrimps were ordinarly size - not tiger shrimps. The pasta was greasy and the food was a little cold. My SO ordered the salmon and that was OK although it did have a good crust on it.  I would go back for the oysters and the atmosphere. It seems like a warm place and worth a second shot."}
{"text":"When the sun is out, it's patio time!  I wasn't a huge fan of the sangria.  It was a tad heavy on the ice and not so much on the flavour.  For $10 a glass, that's the price you have to pay to sit and bask in the glorious sun.    The fries were yummy.  The calamari was strange.  The batter was too... White.  I like a golden brown, crisp coating.  This wasn't it.  The calamari itself was very tender though.  Our friends ordered a plate of a dozen oysters.  $3 each was about right.  They seemed to enjoy them.  It's tough to get a decent spot on a beautiful day.  I guess this place was alright."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday and expected a fair bit since I've heard a lot about this place from family and friends.  Also it was a nice opportunity to visit the distill district and have a nice dinner with some friends.   We were greeted by a rather rude waiter who proceeded to make us wait over 15 minutes when the place seemed empty and there were plenty of tables available.  He took a while to ask us for drinks and seems very reluctant to get into details about the specials and menu.  We ended up just ordering what sounded good and a bunch of oysters to share.  Food took a while to come out, the oysters were fresh, but no lemons were given and it took a while to get them.  I ordered the rib and it was decent, but again my food came out later than all ny friends who were basically finished.   We asked if there was any kind of birthday special, which the waiter replied \"no\" and he also wouldn't put a candle on a piece of cake for the birthday girl.  Some kind of service for a party of 8 people!  Needless to say I probably won't be coming back, the service was horrendous."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the Distilerry District.  we went there for a business trip (12 of us)...  since we made a reservation, we got seated right away.  we started with fresh oyster appetizer... they were amazingly fresh. we tried a variety of oysters from PEI (Prince Edward Island) to Kumamoto... the kumamoto oyster were amazing...    then we continued with the main close... half the table got steak. the other got fish... evenly split... the fish with risotto were excellent... very nice texture and well cooked.. i was pleased...  finished off with desert.... what could be better than chocolate cake...  good service though. our waiter was very attentive."}
{"text":"I visited here on a Friday night with a group of four. We were seated really quickly without a reservation and the venue was very busy. The atmosphere is great; dark lighting, comfortable and lively. There service was okay and the food was pretty good.  We ordered a few plates to share: mussels, deep fried squid, mushroom lobster pasta and the crispy skinned salmon with pommes anna. The squid had an off-putting texture but the mussels were incredible, and the salmon was perfect. I also found the pasta in the lobster dish to be overcooked and mushy but everything else had great flavour. I hope to try a few other things in the menu next time."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio!  A must visit in the summer.  Surprisingly good veggie burger, reasonable sangria, and friendly service. A great place to lounge in the summer."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some oysters and bubbly! Service was friendly and attentive, and the few dishes we had were great!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The service started off average; there was no personality in our waiter but we were served our drinks in a timely fashion, had some appetizers and our main's came out at an understandable time for a busy Saturday night. However, the night turned sour after the main dishes were served. Our waiter disappeared and trying to flag down another waiter for service was next to near impossible. We were never asked for a second drink and our water glasses went empty. We waited nearly an hour after our meals were finished (!!) for our waiter, but having wore our patience thin we tracked him down and asked for our bill. It took our waiter an additional 30 minutes (!!!!) to get the bill. Having waited over an hour and a half AFTER the meal was finished to get out bill, we were all in agreement that he deserved absolutely no tip. As we left the restaurant the waiter had the balls to confront us and make some crude statement along the lines of \"Is that what you've give as your final total for that meal?\" (!!!!!!!!). Having had enough we just left the restaurant and all bitched on the way out. Looking back, I wish I had called the manager and had the waiter reprimanded. I would never eat here again and I make it a point to complain about this place any opportunity I get."}
{"text":"Hey reader, I came here with a special lady for a special afternoon and the food was great. We had the salmon with salad and the green curry mussels and both plates made us happy.   The service was lacking and that really sucks. I am a fan of interacting with staff who love their jobs and I figured that maybe this guy applied to the wrong location. How could anybody have been so grim, working on a beautiful summer afternoon in the Distillery District during a time when it wasn't even busy? I would describe this grumpy grumpster, but you'd probably recognize him as the mid-thirties male waiter, who wants big tips from big tables. If he was actually providing service, perhaps I could describe him better. Yes, I was green with envy when he was talking up the table with the 6 or 7 older folks seated a few tables behind us since he had no smiles to share with me and my lady =(   I've been working in the service industry since I was 16 and I know boring customers are no fun so I make an effort to be social with staff everywhere. I know I didn't do anything to provoke his cold shoulder since we barely had a chance to have small talk or even exchange glances!   I still left a nice tip ($11+) for a $75 dollar meal for barely any service, in hopes that he can learn to appreciate everybody who walks through the doors.   That guy needs to learn how to turn lemon into lemonade. All he did was deliver the sour."}
{"text":"A bit too pricy. Good quality but the mussels were tiny!  And the dessert menu really lacking in anything yummy."}
{"text":"Went here for AYCE mussels on Mondays, with a group of 4. Seated without any problems at 6PM, started getting pretty busy around 7. There were two flavours for the mussels, traditional and thai curry. The thai curry flavour was pretty good, but all of us thought traditional was the winner hands down. Got the mussels with fries, which were okay, and the bread was pretty good. Would go again if craving lots of mussels. Our waitress was great, but service slowed down a little when it got busier (which is reasonable). Overall would go again."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice with a pleasant experience both times.  First time was a dinner and second time I did the summerlicious menu for lunch on the patio. The food is great, especially the PEI mussels as well as the oysters which you can never go wrong.  On the pricy side but definitely a great restaurant for those special occasions."}
{"text":"It was a breath of fresh air to dine at Pure Spirits Oyster House & Grill. It was mild, rain-free summer night (one of the few of this year's Toronto's summer). Pure Spirits was the perfect match to this now rare and awesome weather. Our dinner was very satisfying and very enjoyable from beginning to end. And the ambiance and service was ultra cool.   We shared all our delicious dishes that night: mussels & frites, calamari and 12 fresh oysters recommended by our knowledgeable and friendly waiter. My good friend and I our devoured all our food and managed to end on a sweet note with the flourless dark chocolate gateau. I am NOT a dark chocolate fan, but after consuming this dessert, I am definitely a fan of this dark chocolate cake! Promise me you will still order this cake even after you're full from dinner, okay? You best promise!  My friend and I were so engrossed in our delightful meal and conversation that we didn't notice we were still enjoying ourselves quite some time after Pure Spirits hours. Oopsy! But it was all good, the staff never rushed us once to boot us out the door and by the look on their faces, they weren't bothered one bit that we were there while they were closed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is overrated.  Management really need to take a better look at service here. Firstly, they have a huge patio with lots of empty tables and tons of people waiting in line without a clue as to why there are not being seated. The answer is: they want to avoid backing up the kitchen - aka. they are too cheap to actually staff that kitchen to match the demand on the patio.   The food was fine. The server however decided to add an \"event tip\" of 16% on our bill at the end. When questioned, this apparently was a \"group tip\", even though we were just 4 people! My husband went back to ask about it and the manager's response was \"I would have to check what happened\". Really? How about you go check and then come back with an apology.  Bottom line: I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent place for oysters with a large selection to choose from. Recently came here for a quick bite and ended up ordering the clam vongole, oyster Po boy and a dozen oysters. Everything was delicious. Will definitely come back for oysters in the future."}
{"text":"Great food. Outside , the oysters and mussels were very good. The burger was nicely smoked. Great service ."}
{"text":"I really don't like giving bad reviews unless they really piss me off and not care  about the fact that their customers are truly disappointed.  The Oyster house is one of those places, they just don't care about the customers . They might be doing alright because of their location and the beautiful Distillery as a destination but they wont stay in business for long if they continue having such a horrible service. I cant even get into details as it makes me even angrier."}
{"text":"We went to dinner there last night with a relative from out of town. The atmosphere is great and I loved the decor. We were served by Dom ( I hope I'm spelling his name right, he's originally from Algeria) he was extremely polite,  thoughtful, and gave us great suggestions: the Pappardelle was amazing and the cod was divine!  One thing I appreciate is that he kept refilling our waters, I know its silly but many restaurants don't do this enough.   I will definitely return on a Tuesday to try the $1.50 oysters."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend for dinner for his birthday. I know he loves seafood. He had the starter calamari , which was very unique and delicious, and the ciopini ; broth was flavourful , had melt in your mouth salmon, muscles, lobster, shrimp. I had the 12 oz ribeye. SO GOOD! I didnt enjoy the bed of kale and Brussels sprouts but that's just a personal thing.  It's upscale ish in price but worth the atmosphere and quality. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"the truffle sauce pasta tastes great, but the recommended one is...ummm...maybe I'll not have it next time."}
{"text":"The Distillery District is a very unique and wonderful place to explore. Shopping off the Parliament street entrance we wove our way through shops and we're ready for a drink and food (the wx was 45°)  ......And then we discovered Pure Spirits Oyster House and Grill.   What a Fantastic establishment. Tori (Victoria) was our host,guide, bartender and a Great person.   The menu was succinct and had a great array of options. We started with an excellent Sauvignon Blanc (Kim Crawford, NZ) and Pure Spirits 23oz Draft Lager  My wife went with the 1-piece Fish and Chips with fries and slaw (CAD 17.95).  I went with the Yukon fries with a trio of dips (chipotle ketchup, infused malt vinegar and aioli (CAD 9.50) - Loved it .......and I went right to the Oysters - Shuckers Special (CAD 35/dz). Absolutely fantastic...a mix of Tatamangouche, From Nova Scotia, Fiddlers Cave, MA and Kushi from British Columbia. The chef and Tory had me work through the East Coast oysters to the West's Coast Kushi - meaty and buttery. Loved it so much I did another 1/2 dz (Tatamangouch and Kushi).  Great location, Great Service, Great People, Great Food  Will we go back: ABSOLUTELY- we can't wait to get back to Toronto!!!!"}
{"text":"I came in with a group of 5 and we were aged from low  20s to mid 20s. I guess we weren't up to par with their standards of what their guests should be like because we were told that there were no tables available when it was clear that there was. Will never come back here after the disgusting treatment and will definitely be telling our friends and family."}
{"text":"Really nice patio in the distillery district. Our servers were really nice but food was not that memorable. Ordered the mussels (in thai yellow curry sauce) and fries (with chipotle ketchup dip). I'm not sure how I felt about the thai curry sauce for the mussels. There was something a bit off about it for my taste. It was ok for the mussels themselves, but not a good sauce for dipping the bread into. Fries were pretty average, and the chipotle ketchup was good."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, the bartender/server was wonderful, good suggestions and just the right amount of attentiveness.  Good was good. The wine suggestion was splendid with my meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite oyster bar / seafood restaurant!! I've been here for at least 5 times and never had a bad food"}
{"text":"We ate here on our last night in Toronto.   It was not that crowded, which surprised us and the restaurant.    The service was a little slow, but the food was most excellent.  I ordered the yellow tuna - my son a steak and my daughter and wife the pasta seafood dish.  Nothing was left on the plates when we were done eating.  We enjoyed 3 Desserts which were a nice size.   I ordered the pie.    Our hotel (Fairmont) suggested we try pure spirits for dinner, and as usual there recommendations were spot on."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious, and I've had better.   The oysters were very good , but they were also not cooked and prepared.   The food was okay. I had a soup and it was VERY salty. The food itself was quite bland or very salty and nothing special.   When we got the chocolate tart dessert, mine was covered in sprinkles and whipped cream with fruit, while my friends was plan with nothing on it. Standards much?"}
{"text":"The food and ambiance were great....had a perfect spot on the patio. The service was a little sub par...was served drinks in dirty glasses and getting the bill was a bit of a headache. That being said, I had a great meal otherwise. I had oysters and the bouillabaise....yum!  This would be an awesome place for a date, groups, and friends visiting Toronot"}
{"text":"Single worst bowl of gumbo I have ever eaten, period. Do not know why it's on the menu, when the chef clearly does not know how to make a roux. Thickened by what might as well have been raw flour paste. Big chunks of flavorless dry sausage and a few popcorn shrimp, so even the seafood involved was far from what you'd expect from an \"oyster house\".   Soup of the day, minestrone, comes with a shimmering top layer of grease.   One star added because the outside seating is pleasant."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious in July 2017 and the quality of food was not as expected. The portions were small, and 3/4 of the plate was covered by fries. Some might like that, but I would prefer a larger sandwich or fried cod portion. Also, the cubano sandwich came in a half-sandwich portion... unless someone can tell me otherwise and the cubano sandwich a la carte (not part of summerlicious menu) is also a half-sandwich, the portions should not be that different between summerlicoius and the a la carte menu. If the portions are the same between both menus, then the overall portions are just small and food is overpriced for what it's worth."}
{"text":"It was like a pricier red lobster. Very large and loud. Impersonal. Service was... just fine. Brisk and didn't check in much. Food was fine. I had the brussel sprouts side. It was very dry.  The duck was very nice. Well seasoned and cooked just right. Wine list is generous and great range of prices. Dinner mates enjoyed their meals. One had the burger and shake. Shake was good. Burger was dry and over cooked. Over all... meh."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. I was given a fishy salmon crab roll along with an appetizer that was basically water and cucumber. The waiter was very unfriendly so I tipped him 10% while my girlfriend tipped 3%, I laughed since she did a better job then I did. Never come here. Also, the oysters were bad."}
{"text":"Waited a while for a patio table but if you didnt care where you sat, lots of seating available indoors. Nothing compared to El Catrins hour plus line across.  Server was attentive maybe a little overly so as we werent ready to order for a while :).  The complimentary bread was delivered after we received our entrees - that was odd.  On to the food. Two of us shared the surf and turf, subbing mashed potato for fries, and the satay seared snapper. I felt the snapper soup base they recommended me dipping the bread in, was too oily, and taste wasnt satay to me, more like a light savoury base. Surf and turf was good. Fries were a bit overcooked.  Prices are high! Especially since portions are small. I enjoyed my overall experience though on the patio and thus, four stars."}
{"text":"We found this place after a recommendation from a tour guide. While the trout pate was delicious and totally hit our afternoon munchies requirements, the place as a whole was a little blah on atmosphere. The beers were adequate and the service was very average."}
{"text":"Only reviewing oysters here. Oysters were fresh enough, but the selection was limited on boxing day, with almost all selling out by 7pm. Sauces were good.  Staff was friendly and the service was good (we sat at the bar -- no wait). The decor is sleek and modern.   I'd probably come back here if I was craving some oysters and happened to be in the distillery district, but probably wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"I love the Distillery District ! It's always a 'must see' when we have people from out of town visiting us. Anyway, we wanted a place that had a large patio with a menu that would appeal to any palette.   * As mentioned by others, the patio here is quite big - they seem to be able to take any size group. When I went to the washroom, I noticed that the décor inside was nice as well. * Both food and drink menus were extensive, albeit expensive. You're definitely paying for the ambiance, but the food is pretty good too. As an appetizer, we had the oysters that came with three sauces: cocktail sauce, a hot/spicy sauce, and a vinegar/cucumber sauce. For my main, I ordered the Thai Curry Mussels with frites; the portion was quite large. * Reservations (which are needed) can be made conveniently on-line. * Service was great; our server was very friendly.  Good for: celebrations, patio, drinks, tourists"}
{"text":"Really good oysters. Some of the best I've ever had. I would have preferred a little cocktail sauce and tabasco for them but when in Rome. Beer was very nice. Food was very good as well. Yellowfin tuna was pretty solid. Service was prompt and courteous. The hostess even charged my phone for me. Not terribly priced either. I think we all got out of there for about $75/head.  Oh, and the bathrooms were really clean and nice."}
{"text":"Kumamato oysters were excellent, as was the service and scenery. The wait staff was helpful, Margie even gave us some great ideas for our next stops in Buffalo and Niagra Falls."}
{"text":"Great place to chill out and hang out. The oysters were delicious. 6 for $12. The moosehead radler is delicious which a hint of grapefruit. It's the best beer I've had. Definitely recommend for a laid back place to hang out and knock back a few beers."}
{"text":"I just got home from Pure Spirits and I'm still confused as to what just happened. My friend lives in the Distillery district and we frequently visit restaurants in the area. Being avid seafood/oyster fans, we have been wanting to try it here for a while. We usually go to Rodney's on King, and wanted to try something new and close by.  My friend and I ordered the $36 dozen oyster mix to start. Followed by two \"New England Clam Chowders.\" We were then going to share an order of mussles.  The oysters were not the best (I've had better, had worse.) Our main issue started the second the \"clam chowder\" was brought to us. Honestly - Campbell's makes better Clam Chowder than what was presented to us tonight. The soup tasted worse than canned, and barely had any clams in it. It did however have corn and celery.... and was extremely bland and watered down.  I was starving so I ate it anyway (the slow service did not help) - but my friend was truly disgusted, and could not finish hers. When our waiter arrived back, he asked how the soup was. My friend told him she did not want hers (and maybe only had eaten two spoonfuls.) I then chimed in telling him that I was also not so impressed. His response was something along the lines of \"that's a shame.\" No apology. No nothing.  Apparently our waiter took this complaint personally, and refused to serve us for the rest of the night. Would not refill our water, would walk straight past us, and would not even make eye contact. It felt brutally uncomfortable each time he would walk by and literally snub us. (He was talkative and friendly before this happened.)  Our mussels were then brought out by a different waiter and our water was now being refilled by the hostess.   When we complained about the soup, it was done in a polite and casual way - we were by no means rude about it. And this treatment from someone in the service industry was completely unacceptable.  Needless to say, we couldn't even enjoy our mussels due to this awkward experience. We did not even finish them.  Our bill came to over $100 , and they didn't even remove the $11 uneaten soup.  Based on this unfortunate experience, we will not return, and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for BFs Mom's Birthday, we ordered: -Seafood linguine (mom said she liked it) -Mussels and Parmesan & rosemary fries. (I enjoyed this, just bummed that the fries were really nothing special) -BBQ Baby Back Ribs (BF did not like the BBQ sauce they used, he also did not like the fact that fries were not a side...) -Side of fries (were good but went stale really fast when cold)   I had asked the hostesses if they were able to do anything small but special for birthdays, and was told nothing complimentary but they can put a candle maybe? I asked if maybe they could write something on a plate and they said no. That kind of made me disappointed. If low end and other high end restaurants were able to do something little on desserts we ordered then I don't understand why they could not do something special for occasions here.   Our server was basic, he did not bother to make conversation with us. Just came by and asked us what we wanted to order. Did not go out of his way to be nice nor bothered to ask us how we liked our meal. After we got our oysters I asked for bread...he would not have brought it out. I don't really understand if every table gets bread or only certain ones. Because if so, the bread is really slow.   For the price of our meal, I feel like the service should have been higher. I felt like we were shoved away and rushed in and out. The food was nice but the service was lacklustre. I'm sorry if I sound picky, but I really wanted it to be a special night for my BFs mom."}
{"text":"The restaurant hits all the basic requirements to be considered a great restaurant. The beautiful patio escalates the entire experience. The food was pretty good. I ordered the pure spirits pappardelle. It had a lot less lobster than what I was paying for and I tasted almost no truffle in the truffle cream sauce. The portions were perfect. Not to much and not to little. The service was excellent. I would highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Visited the Distillery yesterday with an old friend.  We first had lunch here and what a dissapointment.  We both had fish and chips and the fish was basically inedible.  Not cooked properly and quite tough.  The wine/beer selection was ok and we didn't complain as it was a congenial day out at the Christmas market and I didn't want to cause a fuss and spoil the day.  Maybe that was there only 'off' dish, but I would be very reluctant to return."}
{"text":"Good spot for a nice meal. Nothing totally over-the-top, but the food is really solid, and the drinks were good. Service is really nice, and what you'd expect for a higher-end restaurant. Super bustling, plenty of people here during the Christmas market. Considering the rush the waitstaff had it down really good.  If you're looking for a really unique meal, I'd still pick the place across the street, but if you're feeling like some pretty straight up seafood and other standard Canadiana choices, this is the place to go in the distillery."}
{"text":"Very nice location, and good service. Food was OK but not excelent or delicious. Pasta overcooked, light flavour of anchovies even if suppose to be putanesca .French fries  were totally not French. Good sauce  for meats but not enough to cover other issues. Staff were amazed that pasta comes with a spoon  and parmezan? !"}
{"text":"A good place to go for some drinks on the patio - their patio is huge. It wraps around the restaurant on the left and then continues into a larger area in the back. The oyster selection is excellent and starts with your standard cheapy malpeque oyster to the more expensive kaipara.   Drinks selection is also good but not great. They have a good assortment of mixed drinks along with a hand full of beer choices and wines. I got a mill street organic in the bottle and my friend got their seasonal beer, a delicious Quebecois beer called la fin du monde.   The oysters came out with 3 sauces: seafood sauce, mango sauce, and cucumber/onion mignonette. I didn't think any of the sauces were that great although the mango one was interesting. There was also freshly grated horseradish (very important!), tobasco and lime.   I'll be back to try their dinner/lunch menu for sure. I was eyeing the lobster as it was being carried out to another table!   Service was very friendly. Parking can be found either at the large green p nearby on the streets surrounding the distillery which are also green ps."}
{"text":"Commenting purely on oysters and beer here peeps.  My boyfriend and I came here two Sundays ago after some St. Paddy's Day celebrating. We ordered the Shucker's Dozen, which was a selection of various types of oysters.  Each of us ordered a beer to have with the seafood. My boyfriend's first beer was poured and it said it seemed \"skunk\" smelling. He is quite the beer connoisseur, so I believe he knew what he was talking about. Our waiter was very professional and kind about getting him something else. My beer tasted just fine to me!  I really enjoyed the oysters, loved the three different sauces accompanying the meal and also the fresh horseradish (oh how I love you!). My BF did eat an oyster that he said had some yucky grit in it, for which I have to remove one star. If you are an oyster house, something like that should not happen to your customers, especially when you pay $3 - $5 dollars a morsel and you have to leave it behind in your napkin.  Overall, I enjoyed our visit but will most likely not rush back."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile but last time was great. A fresh selection of Maritime oysters and an adequate selection of fish. A nice patio outdoors and a spacious interior. Pricey."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here on an EXTREMELY hot and sunny day. We had a table on the patio, which was perfect. It was extremely hot on that day we went but where the patio is located - there are tall buildings so there was wind and it wasn't utterly hot and we were able to enjoy the weather.  We first sat at the bar while the staff got our table ready. The bar staff was fun, nice, and friendly. The waiter at our table would forget some things but he was still great. He was friendly and courteous.   We ordered a couple dishes and just shared everything. I love family style because I like to have a taste of everything! Traditional provencale mussels: I generally like this dish but i'm going to say It was okay as it was nothing different and special. Chopped salad: this was very refreshing and the perfect had to our meal. I ate around the chickpeas but i'm just not a fan of that! =p Crab and salmon roll: this was good! The crab and salmon on it's own is a little salty but with the brioche bun, it is perfect! Even the fries it comes with is good. Lobster pappardelle: this was AMAZING. I definitely need to come back for this dish. I would even recommend another to come here just for this dish! The black truffle cream sauce was perfectly creamy and the lobster pieces were pretty big.  Food (Taste): 4/5 Food (Presentation): 3/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Price: 3/5"}
{"text":"Cute little spot in the distillery district.  Reasonably priced I had the fish and chips. Can't complain food tasted good with in house made tartar sauce. Staff was friendly I would go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"The oysters are fresh and tasty but not cheap. They have a great selection ranging in price from $2.50_$4 each. The seafood dishes are great. I have been  here several  times for dinner and have never been disappointed. The dinner prices range between  $19- $40 with the average per dinner entree around $30. So for 2 ppl with entrees and oysters you should be expecting  to pay $100 with NO alcohol. Still it's good food ;)"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times now and each time the service was outstanding and the food was absolutely delicious! Went there for my dad's 50th birthday a year ago and, although they were very busy and food came a bit delayed, our server was extremely apologetic and even brought out oysters on the house!   Parents loved it so much so that we came back here for his 51st birthday last week!  Different server this time, however, we still got amazing service (this time food came out much quicker - so no freebies :)   Everything, from oysters and fried calamari, mains (Yellowfin tuna was to die for) to creme brulee for dessert was absolutely outstanding, from presentation to taste!  If you are looking for a great seafood restaurant with an impeccable service and atmosphere, I highly recommend to dine here."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but incredibly expensive, which I suppose is just a mark up for being in the Distillery District. I got the Japanese clam chowder, which was savory and unique, as well as the Caesar salad, which was bigger than anticipated so yay! Husband got the fish hush puppies, which were surprisingly good and the falafel wrap, which comes with fries and a side salad. Service was excellent - very attentive on refilling the waters, and I appreciated that the water was room temperature and not with ice."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the look of this place. It's got a good vibe. Food is stellar. Always. The truffle pasta should remain on the menu forever. My only complaint is that we made reservations using OpenTable.com and our reso wasn't in their computer. Not a big deal, but the hostess kind of made me feel like an idiot about it... kind of blunt/sort of rude. That was until I showed her the email and confirmation. We were sat shortly after that."}
{"text":"3.5 for food, 4 for service  Went here for lunch and ordered the slow roast lamb sandwich, my friend ordered the kalbi beef (Korean short rib) sandwich with a kimchi slaw in it.  The lamb sandwich was ok...it had some pesto oil/cilantro sauce thing on it which I think ruined the lamb.  Now I love me some cilantro so when I say it ruined the flavour..that says a lot.  The kalbi beef sandwich  was DELICIOUS.  I could eat that all day!    The server we had (I forgot his name) couldn't have been more pleasant!  He asked if we wanted lemon or lime slices for our water and was extremely polite - but not in that fake ass way.  Never overbearing or pushy.  A pleasant time spent here - I would come back just for that sandwich!!"}
{"text":"We were here last night, and had quite a nice time.  Their patio is extensive.  With the brick floors, the atmosphere is authentic, but I did trip a few times (pre-wine) walking on the patio.  The wine list is ok, but a bit price, average of $13 per glass.  We ordered the mac and cheese with smoked salmon and seafood and a spelt pasta with sun dried tomatoes, caramelized butternut squash and goat cheese (there was something green on there too).  Both were quite tasty.  They will bring you unlimited amounts of bread (if you want it).  I think the portion sizes were more than adequate.  I think next time my friend and I will just share one order of pasta, rather than getting 2 orders.  Nice place to dine, but it was a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing food. I could go on and on about this place but ill just go straight to the point. We had mussels in spicy tomato sauce, grilled shrimp, crab cakes with black beans (the crab cake itself was perfect, however, I did not care for the beans made no sense to me) I had the Branzino which was wrapped in prosciutto, hubby had grilled halibut with couscous which was heavenly. My branzino had me speechless. Perfectly cooked. And anything wrapped in prosciutto to me is flawless. Dessert was passion fruit tart which was just ok and chocolate ganache tart was a little too chocolatey for my liking. All in all it's a great restaurant and a must try!"}
{"text":"Solitary seared salmon lunch was yummy. Service was a little perfunctory, but that might be because I was dining alone. But the manager saved the day by starting a conversation right before I was going to leave..."}
{"text":"While exploring Distillery District, we got hungry and had brunch at Pure Spirits Oyster House and Grill. In addition to dining room seating, this restaurant has an outdoor patio.  The Soup of the Day were Gumbo Soup and Tomato Basil Soup.  Being an oyster house, we had to get some raw seafood - oysters and clams. We ordered two of each of three kinds of raw oysters from Prince Edward Islands and six littleneck clams. The PEI oysters consisted of Malpeque, Raspberry Point, Lucky Lime. They were accompanied with cocktail sauce, horseradish, spicy mango habanero, and cucumber mignonette.  We were quite impressed with all of our entrees. The Calamari Tempura consisted of Chinese salt and pepper deep fried calamari rings served with two kinds of dipping sauces - tamari mirin and teriyaki.  The Cod Cake Benedict consisted of fried tasty cod cake, poached eggs, and goose island ipa hollandaise sauce. It was served with a side Salad tossed in a spiced balsamic vinaigrette and crispy French fries.   The Organic East Coast Mussels consisted of mussels cooked in tomato, garlic, herbs de provence, basil, and parsley. I expected the yukon fries to be served with three dipping sauces (i.e., chipotle ketchup, infused malt vinegar, and aioli) but It was served with just ketchup.  The Ontario Trout consisted of crispy skinned pan seared trout fillet served with mixed green salad and cherry tomatoes in spiced balsamic vinaigrette. We liked how the fish tasted and how it was prepared. However, the salad dressing was a bit too spicy so we exchanged it for a Caesar Salad. It wasn't your typical Caesar salad, it was tossed in a greek dressing instead."}
{"text":"Went here for one of my birthday lunches a while back and it was great! Oysters were delicious with the home made sauces and I really enjoyed their tuna tartare.  Service is great but a little pushy... But the food makes up for it. Sit outside in the summer and you'll be in a happy place ;)"}
{"text":"Situated in the distillery district, this establishment always has a hungry crowd at its doorstep.  This part of the city has a great vibe so you definitely want to stick around after shopping, a theatre event or just plain wandering.    Now, I don`t eat oysters so please head over and try that part of their menu because it is what they are known for.  However, for people like me that prefer land creatures or maybe shrimps, lobster and crab cakes - your eye tends to wander to what else they offer.  First off, we sat on terribly uncomfortable chairs in their lovely patio area.  I really did enjoy the setting.  Second, our server, though present in the very beginning, completely disappearred later on. We were making jokes on the likelihood, she would never come back.  On to the food, one clear opinion stood out about each dish, It was ok. Every dish tasted under seasoned. Falling flat in the flavour palette."}
{"text":"I love Pure Spirits. The oysters are the best. The service is excellent. It's a great place to relax and enjoy a nice glass of wine. The raspberry point oysters from P.E.I. today hit the spot. This time I also had the chopped salad. Fresh and light with chicken, avocado, asparagus, chick peas and roasted corn with romaine lettuce.  My husband had the Ahi Tuna Tartar and the Lake Erie pickerel which had a lovely crispy skin. So good."}
{"text":"The food here looked really crappy but no matter,  I only had one thing in mind,  and that thing is oysters.  I came here on my birthday, a Tuesday luckily enough for their $1.50 oyster Tuesdays.  Once again a place that claims it knows all about oysters has no green Tabasco. Fucking posers.  So I brought my own green Tabasco, got my dozen oysters with a nice White Russian (made fairly well here)  I can't really rate the quality of raw oysters but I was the only one in here at 2:00 pm on a Tuesday, some good music was playing and the decor is nice. I'm guessing the place fills up at night time because its HUGE in here.  nice place, I would go again for the oysters."}
{"text":"Last time I eat at this restaurant.   We went for Christmas eve and the food was average .   The waiter was doing us a favor working the 24th.    The place is tired."}
{"text":"Um. Good. Not great, but certainly not bad. Food was far better than the service. Drinks were stingy on the pour, but the entrees were quite yummy. Our waiter was a charming, affable space cadet with good intentions, an earnest desire to please, and no idea how to serve. We began with the Chinese mussels, had the tuna and the strip, and enjoyed all three. Very tasty."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate my engagement back in June 2013 and was not impressed with the service. The waiter didn't make good recommendations when I asked what are the most popular dishes. The dessert was not very good and his recommendations were not good. He didn't to ask me if I liked the food or not and didn't seem to care as they were busy. I told him that I didn't like my food and the dessert was way too sweet, one of the worst I have had which he recommended. He said everything on the menu was good. He didn't bother to suggest another dish or dessert as an alternative like the other restaurants that I have been to and didn't bother to ask if I want those bad dishes removed from the bill. I  should have demanded him to change my entree and dessert to something else. Usually at the other restaurants that I have been to where I complain that the food sucks. They would ask to change the dish to something else or remove it from my bill since I barely touched it or ate it. The food is not good here anymore. The service and food used to be way better back a few years ago. When I said the food was not good, the waiter defended himself and said he thinks the food is good. Overall it was a mistake coming her to celebrate an engagement. I should have gone to a better restaurant with better service such as the ones from Oliver and Bonnacini such as Biff's Bistro instead. I would never go back to this place. The only thing that is good here is oysters, that's it! Everything else sucks. Don't try their dessert (creme brule) and seafood (octopus)...It was crap! We spent $200 for 2 of us her and it was a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Not such a great experience on my first outing here. As a side note to my comments, the Boiler House was closed for a private party, so the overflow ended up at Pure Spirits.  The restaurant was packed and the only available seating was outdoors. We thought we would brave the patio. Okay, so we are shown our table and it is at the end, the very back of the patio.. in no man's land. It would have been okay had the wind not picked up and started to chill everyone. Oh yes, there were patio heaters... 4 to be exact. There should of been at least 10 for the size of the patio.  Server came to take our table immediately and wanted to know if we knew what we wanted to order... we had not even open the menus. So we placed our drink order. Ten minutes later another server came by and wanted to take our order. We mentioned we placed a drink order and he said that it will be coming out. In the meantime, another couple had been seated and got their drinks and appetizers even before we saw anything on our table. Finally,  20 minutes later, the server showed up with the drinks.  We decided to stick it out a bit even though we were freezing. We placed orders for appetizers and crossed our fingers. By this time, we decided to just have the appetizers and then leave. The server came back to take our order for the mains, and we told her we would be leaving after the appetizers. At that time she mentioned the kitchen was behind in getting out orders. You think she would have mentioned that when we sat down. We got our appetizers and asked for our bill so we didn't have to track her down later. Appetizers were good. We tried to find her to get our bill and pay. Finally got the bill, paid and left.  It was a BAD experience overall. For as many people as were being seated on the patio, there should have been more patio heaters. There weren't enough servers to accommodate the guests on the patio and there should have been some notification by the hostess of the time issues before being seated.  Will I be back... don't think so."}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge fans of Pure Spirits Oyster House & Grill.  We had the opportunity to eat here while we were in Toronto for our honeymoon.  The restaurant itself is located in the Distillery District, a very fun area to explore if you are visiting the city, and it offers a great atmosphere with a huge patio in the summer and cozy interior for the winter.  For an appetizer, we decided to order oysters.  They were fresh and fantastic.  For our entrees, my husband ordered the thai green curry mussels with wild lime leaves, coconut cream, and sweet basil ($17).  I ordered the chickpea falafel salad with smoky babaganoush, dandelion, tzatziki heirloom tomatoes and house pickles ($16).  Our entrees were absolutely fantastic, and we ate everything on our plate!  Typically, my husband and I will split a dessert.  Their dessert menu was so fantastic however that we ordered two desserts to try:  The Gin and Tonic with Gin semifreddo, tonic lemongrass fluid gel, and lime bubbles ($8) and Strawberries and Cream with strawberry consommé, vanilla honey yogurt panna cotta, fresh Ontario strawberries, and lemon poppy seed shortbread ($10).  Both desserts were delicious and we are going to have to agree to disagree on what was our favorite dessert.  They were both so good!  Our service was also impeccable.  Our server was nice, attentive, and fun.   In sum, we couldn't of asked for a better meal at a better restaurant.  If we are in the area again, we will definitely be dining here!"}
{"text":"This food here tastes really good.  If you're into seafood, it's worth going (even if you don't like oysters much like me... the other items on the menu are delicious).  The oysters are good.  I got the mussels in the white wine sauce which were very good (you get a lot of mussels... they could be considered a main even though they are an appetiser... maybe 30-50 mussels?).  The white wine sauce was very good.  For entrees/mains, we got the Halibut on cheese risotto, and the octopus with lentils.  Let me tell you, the cheese risotto with the halibut was so rich and tasty, the best risottto I've tried.   It was very rich.  Probably terribly unhealthy too.  The lentils with the octopus also had a very strong mustard/lemony flavour that went very well with asparagus.  I'd recommend both of the entrees we tried.  The only downside, and really big downside, to this place is price.  Don't expect to walk out of here with a date for any thing under $100.  This place for 2 is going to set you back between 100-200 comfortably.  If it weren't so pricey, I'd go back again more often."}
{"text":"I went today for lunch with a friend because of the beautiful weather.  We went around 12, and requested for a patio seat.  They told us it would be about 20 minutes.  They gave us this \"buzzer\" where they will contact you as soon as possible.  We went to the outside patio/bar outside for a bit, sat there for about 5-10 minutes, and they called us for a seat.  My friend ordered the calamari salad with the blanche de chambly, and I had the ahi tuna salad with the mill street lemon tea ale.  The salad was not worth its price at all!  The amount of food that was provided was not very filling at all.  I'm just glad that they had some bread for us before hand.  The ahi tuna was mediocre.  I was not very impressed.  The beer though, was a very interesting taste.  The service wasn't that great also.  I felt like the waitress had a fake smile on her face the whole time.  Patio was nice, but looking at the Boiler House right across the street made me really want to there instead."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night, busy but not crazy.  Had the Liver  Parfait - very good and then steak - good not great.  Service was fine, first bottle of wine was bad, 2nd adn 3rd choices were out of stock.  Overall good food, good service, prices seem a tad high in relation to food quality, so not great value.  Very limted number of places to eat in the Distillery Disrict so it is still a good choice."}
{"text":"First the ambience is very romantic.  Expect to shell at least $100 on dinner for two.. Prices are high but food was looking good. We only bought 1/2 dozen oysters for $18.00 ca.  Waiter was a little uppity and seemed upset that we only ordered oysters. We had reservations later that evening but was able to change it to an earlier time. Realized the menu was pretty small and went to another restaurant for good quality seafood with the just right price down the street from the distillery."}
{"text":"Our server JC was truly outstanding. The food was excellent, especially the oysters. Wonderful place - will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. We loved everything we had. The gnocchi is perfection and the lobster pasta was fantastic. Prepare to spend some money- a tad expensive."}
{"text":"We always have a great meal here.  But let's be honest. You come here for the oysters.   They are so good! Some nice sparkling wine, their really good sourdough bread and you are good to go.   Always a great variety.  They have a shuckers dozen always on offer.  Ask your wait staff what the options are before you order.  My faves are the Kussi and Fanny Bay.   Yum.    Fantastic wait staff too.  They remember you from previous visits.  Great ambiance.  Green P Parking on site."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow...painful.  Cesar salad was awesome.  Rest of the food was good but if you eat here make sure you have 2 to 3 hours to wait for the food and drinks."}
{"text":"Three of us wandered in out of the cold on Tuesday afternoon, while exploring the Christmas Market. We were greeted at the door and advised that the wait time was nominal...we were seated once a booth was cleared for us (less than 5 minutes). The decor is outstanding...warm woods, exposed beams, gorgeous original hard wood floors...it is exactly what you expect a restaurant in the area to possess.  Our server was over shortly after we were seated, told us the specials (oysters were $1.50/each) and off she went to get us water. She returned a few minutes later to take our order. She was spectacular....clearly explained the condiments for the oysters (when she brought them out) and was warm and friendly.  So far, so good.   I ordered the Buffallo chicken Mac and Cheese. It was described as smothered in a cheese sauce....what I got certainly didn't live up to the menu's description...it was fairly dry pasta (from sitting under a heat lamp too long) with very LITTLE cheese. If it weren't for the Buffallo sauce from the chicken, it would have been flavourless and awful. The Buffallo chicken tossed in was ok....but they tasted like frozen chicken fingers, diced up, tossed in Buffallo sauce. Totally disappointing....would not recommend....esp. at a $23 price point.   Person 2 ordered the catfish sandwich. Came with coleslaw (on top of the catfish) with a side salad and fries. He said it was amazing, flavourful and moist. The fries were fantastic ( I stole a few) ......he thoroughly enjoyed it....although the bun was way too big for the size of fish he got (he ended up leaving a good portion of the bun on his plate as it was a lot of bread).  The third person ordered oysters (started with 6 and then ordered 6 more). They came with a spicy mango sauce, a cucumber relish and cocktail sauce with horseradish. She loved them. LOVED THEM. She also ordered some sort of fish ball (I think the menu referred to them as poppers) which were composed of various types of seafood (crab, etc) rolled into bite sized balls, breaded and fried. She raved about them.....but her hilight were the oysters.   So, although I'd classify my meal as \"dreadful\", my dining companions enjoyed theirs immensely.    Ambiance is amongst the best.  Dinner, as described above with a glass of advertised wine ($15 for 8oz), a beer and a Diet Coke came to around $110."}
{"text":"As shared appetizers we had the oyster sampler, po' boys, calamari and steamed mussels I'd have to say you should pass up the po' boys as they had barely any oysters in them, more like bread and coleslaw. As for the calamari, its 4 tempura fried pieces for 13 dollars, over priced and nothing special. The oysters and mussels were however quite tasty and fresh. As for main entrees, my boyfriend and I had linguini with seafood and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was tasty yet the mussel in the linguini was not fresh and left a disgusting odour and taste, I ended up leaving it behind. Service was average, I've had better experiences elsewhere."}
{"text":"Avoid the snarky tall bartender with a bad hair cut. Gotta wait 30 min for a bill at the bar. Boooooo"}
{"text":"I have to say afternoon at pure spirt just before was very good. Enjoyed the atmosphere and food.  I was also would I enjoyed the Caesar salad delightful taste of the right balance of lemon juice and Parmesan cheese it had very fresh unique taste to it.  I am not generally a salad person but it definitely woke my taste buds up and kept my mouth watering for more."}
{"text":"Located right in the distillery district, this place looked super cute and inviting and we decided to stop for a couple drinks on a super hot summer day. We sat outside on the patio which had a bar and comfy chairs with tables and TVs - the atmosphere was fun and hip. However, the waitress took forever to come over and when our drinks finally came (I ordered a pina colada and hubby ordered a mai tai), they were watery as if they had been sitting for awhile in the hot sun. They never brought the check over and we ended up sweltering in the heat before we finally got up and asked to pay. Besides the atmosphere (and note, we didn't try the food), this place left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambience, good presentation, cute spot for date night and a quick walk around distillery district. Servers are nice and attentive. I really enjoyed the calamari, it was something different! Not your average deep fried calamari, I believe they used tempera batter, it's more Japanese style calamari which I enjoyed. My boyfriend said he really enjoyed the wings, tender, meaty and there were 3 hot sauces in dropped r bottles came with different levels of spice. My clam chowder was mediocre, you can definitely find better at like specialized fish and chip stores. Flavour was good but not a lot of seafood and a lot of potatoes. I'd give 3.5/5, great potential, I would come back to try other seafood items."}
{"text":"Summer + patio + oysters = wow  I've come across this simple equation through this establishment. It was a quite nice experience.  Afterwards, i realized they have 1.50 oysters on tuesdays afterwards.. So clearly I didn't read the yelp reviews before coming. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I read the three star review and i wanted to believe it was wrong.... the restaurant gets 5 stars for ambience and 5 stars for oysters. The oysters were super fresh and the selection of both East and West Coast was super. the Irish oysters were the only ones that dissappointed. the gentelmen who was behind the oyster bar was very knowlegeable!  Mussel menu looked amazing we did not have time to try them!  the Halibut fish and chips however were very soggy and extremely disppointing! French fries were painfully salty  Go for oysters and great selection of wines and local beers....and have an extremely enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was very excited to eat here for lunch,  however after being seated,  my excited turned to not impressed. We went here for lunch and there were maybe acouple tables occupied, it took roughly 10-15 mins to get a waitress to order drinks. There seemed to be double (at least) the amount of employees compared to customers which made me very confused. The prices did not impress me either even though it was an \"oyster house\". Once we got our drinks we placed our food order, ended up with the  chicken salad and asked if they could make the chicken blackened seasoned (personal preference) the waitress who was very nice said she had to ask her chef which I completely understood. She came back and said they could not (I didn't care too much, but what restuarant doesn't have that seasoning lol). We got our salads and for the price, the portions were small, was still hungry after finishing and they said they could make peri peri chicken (I had no clue what that was haha) ended up saying thank you and grilled chicken was ok haha.  I do not know if I will be back as the first impression was ok, but not satisfying. Salad was good and staff was friendly, but other ran that I was disappointed."}
{"text":"A-OK food and service. Found it pricey for what it is - but what can you expect being in the Distillery district. We can for the summerlicious menu but ended up eating off the regular menu. I think our server was new as he wasn't very knowledgeable of the menu.  Truffle pasta was tasty Calamari was disappointing"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times - once for lunch and most recently for dinner during summerlicious.   Nice atmosphere - elegant yet casual with a spacious patio in the summer. Service is average - nothing to write home about but adequate.   I had a mixed green salad which was fresh and simple. The pan roasted halibut was delicious, served with buttery mashed potatoes. The trio of desserts included a chocolate cake, tiramisu-esque cake, and one more that was apparently unmemorable.   Overall, solid place to eat if you're in the Distillery District. It's my fall back place when Archeo is closed for private functions (as it often is, especially in the summer. the last time I went they were filming a TV show there) and if you don't feel like spending too much $$$ (i.e. Boiler House) but still want a nice, sit-down meal."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday, booked with Open Table.  In the heart of the Distillery District, but you couldn't tell this was in a touristy spot.  Started with Oysters, which I know nothing about. Server was very helpful in my line of questions, and I can honestly say they were terrific. They were pre Shucked, which was a plus, not sure if this is their standard, or just realized I had no idea what I was doing. Had a huge salad, and split the largest bowl of Mussels, both of us could not finish and you could probably go here for mussels and a salad and go away content.   Wine deals were fair. Would go back."}
{"text":"Pure oyster yumminess! I've been here a couple of times and the service and the oysters have not disappointed yet. The location is great, I have been there both during the day in the patio, at night in the dining room, and it's always beautiful and pleasant. Today I tried a mango gazpacho which I didn't really like, but that's my own taste buds; the oysters were still great. Their bread is evil, soooo good!"}
{"text":"Had a mixed platter of the best looking Oysters I have had in a long time. Only $2.50 each. The West Coast Fanny Mae's were huge, firm and delicious. The PEI Malpeques were fresh tasting and while smaller than I expected, it may have only been in comparison!  Good service, and cold beer made the experience even better. But it will be the Oysters that bring me back.   Suggest this as an appetiser before Mexican food across the street :)"}
{"text":"We ordered burger and linguini. Both just average The burger was ok and the chocolate shake is just a joke... mostly foam ;) my favorite part was the bread and butter :))"}
{"text":"Love the venue and the location.  Got here with lots of hope and excitement.   We were greeted in good time and brought our menu, water and all quite nicely to start.   The wine of choice was excellent.  Enigma - Cab was excellent value and taste.   Unfortunately that was the end of the good and now with the disappointments.   The waiter did not get our orders right.  The sides came as appetizers which were to come with our meals.   The fish we ordered was sold out which came highly recommended and the waiter told us to order it.   The salads had way too much dressing.   The tuna bowl had more sauce than fish you couldn't taste the fish.   The side veg including the kale was so salty that you could not eat it.   The Korean fish dish was ok but unfortunately there was a garnish that was inedible by any means.   One of my friends got their salad and their dinner with the appetizer.   Very disappointing evening we didn't even consider desserts or coffee.   What a shame of a night. Two main issues here.  Time to cut back on the salt and cut back on the sauces so that people can enjoy the ingredients.   It looks like they need someone in the kitchen to review their taste buds."}
{"text":"Probably one of the handful of times in my life where I refuse to finish. First, warm bread, totally promising. But should have known when the hostess (there were 3 of them) took 7 minutes and 28 seconds to come back (and yes, I timed them).   Had to wave my arms like a crazy madman before anyone came, but that's ok, I'm a little crazy so who cares.  But then the food.   Caesar salad, absolutely drenched in dressing.  Mussels, seriously? 2x frozen mussels? You think people wouldn't notice? And seriously, you don't have to use half a bottle of olive oil.  Fish and chips.... wow... just wow... first of all, undercooked. Second, the batter was 3-4 times the size of cod, which would have been ok, except NOTHING WAS SEASONED. If you want to taste oil with undercooked fish with batter, yup, order this by all means.   Moving on, the crab gratin. Let me just say this. It is incredibly, let me repeat that, INCREDIBLY difficult to make crab taste like crap. The crab in gratin, of all things where you infuse cream then bake, dryer than my elbow. Wow. WOW.   Lastly, if you are going to charge almost $30 for a lobster pasta, please have more lobster than 2 knuckles and 1 knuckle size tail and 2 leg meats.   I won't even go into the soup of the day.  I felt like I was Gordon Ramsay filming an episode of kitchen nightmare. You should, by now, know what the answer is when you are at the distillery, where should I eat?   The bread was excellent, I had 5 ciabatta bread, so I at least didn't go hungry."}
{"text":"Food is great and fast. Very confused on their menu~ ordered calamari, we got 5 pcs chewy squids (Chinese calamari tasted better than this place), ordered Oysters, came last ( we have to asked other server to get an update if the boat is back cultivating oysters from the Lake.) Our server Patrick no where to find. I have to asked another server again if he can find Patrick.   Finally, he came not even have the passion to ask us how was our dinner. Then I asked for Togo box( hint buddy we are ready for our bill) but no MIA again.   Staying at the Ritz asked our concierge for local hangout and he recommend me this Distillery District expecting not to touristy but failed on our expectation.   Bad experience Will not recommend to come here  if your Server is Patrick."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner here tonight; it was good, but not great. The wine list is too expensive for the choices.  The Caesar salad was OK, but the dressing was a bit sweet.  I like bacon as much as the next person, but it does not belong in a Caesar salad.  Rebecca and Phil had nice pasta dishes.  There was plenty of lobster in the dish and the truffles were a nice addition.  The squash ravioli was very nice.  Unfortunately, my bar-b-que ribs was very ordinary.  Although the meat came off the bone easily, it was dry.  The flavor was ordinary.    This was an up and down meal.  Parts were good and parts were ordinary. I doubt i will return."}
{"text":"*How we heard of this place: It was a busy Friday night at distillery. We knew we wanted a patio seat & my significant other enjoys oysters so I figured from the selection of restaurants, this was the place to go! And with the hostess standing out front with menus to look at, it was hard not to stop by*   We ordered: Shuckers Dozen: Oysters from East to West Coast (PEI saltgrass point, Acadian gold???- I forget, BC marina top drawer) &  Pure Spirits Pappardelle: lobster, wild mushrooms, BLACK TRUFFLE CREAM SAUCE  Oysters were good. Saltgrass point was our favourite because it was nice and clean. The BC Marina top drawer is larger (hard to swallow lol) so you're going to have to chew it! And it's oddly creamy for an oyster. I thought it was interesting and liked it, however it was a complete miss for my dinner date. Dish of the night was most definitely the lobster pasta. We don't like to order the same thing but it just sounded too amazing. Savoury, Mouthwatering, Rich, Filling. Prepare to get itis after that pasta!   We sat at the patio and it was really cute. Our server was very knowledgable about the different types of oysters and he also recommended the pasta to us. Now Yelp reviewers gave this place 3/5 Stars but based on what we ordered, I would have rated it 4.5/5. I saw other tables ordering mussels and they give you a large bowl full of it. I would go back and try it. Complimentary bread is always good too :)"}
{"text":"Came by here because a friend recommended the place and I had a wonderful experience.   The place was beautiful. The interior and atmosphere was very cozy and I loved the brick walls which was what was left over from when this place used to be a large distillery or part of one. To start off, we ordered 2 of their dozen oysters from different regions. I can't say enough about their oysters and how fresh they tasted. It was as if they went to the ocean in their backyard and plucked them right there and then served them to you.. that's how fresh they tasted. I loved their homemade sauces as well as the staples of cocktail and horseradish sauces. I was very pleased with the oysters.  For Dinner I ordered their Yellowfin Tuna that came with black eyed peas, bell peppers, millet hash and egg sabayon. To be honest though, I thought the portion was pretty small compared to the price. The tuna itself was cooked to perfection though but I can't say I liked the egg sabayon. Overall, I wasn't really impressed with the dish.   Service was excellent. The server was very attentive and the manager came by and greeted us and we had small talk. Good experience but very pricey. Would come again but occasionally since it is so expensive.. at least for me."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar... Great service and atmosphere and amazing food.  We split some oysters, lobster, and the seafood Mac and cheese.  The lobster was so perfect.... Cooked perfectly and the cut out of the shells... All perfect with no hassle.  That is how all lobster should be done.  The food is amazing and the oysters were superb.  Great location and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting too much given the reviews but the overall experience was great despite a couple of minor things (forgot about my coffee, didn't really take drink orders).  The brunch menu was varied and catered to all types of diners but all the options were a bit different from your average brunch menu.  The portions were well sized to fill you up.  I had the lobster tagliatelle and it didn't look like a large portion but it was very filling given it was a cream sauce.  My husband had the mussels and fries and said the sauce was okay.  My MIL had the brunch special and enjoyed that.  And the kids shared chicken fingers from the menu.  It would have been great to have some cooked veg options in the kids menu but that is my general complaint.  The ambiance was nice, casual but still a bit upscale.  I would come back and try more other seafood options."}
{"text":"After dining at PSOHG I was pretty surprised to look them up on Yelp and find such a low rating. My experience was pleasant. Showed up for a late lunch on July 1st, Canadian Independence day for you Americans. There was a 10 minute wait for patio seating but well worth it. We decided to graze for the day so only ordered half a dozen oysters (I forget which kind) and a bowl of their Malaysian style mussels. The mussels, although a bit overcooked (shrinking) had the most amazing sauce. My date and I couldn't stop dipping our bread in the sauce. Definitely give the beer, patio and Malaysian sauced mussels if you get the opportunity."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious food, service was tremendous, waiter had great knowledge of the food the restaurants serves, especially the oysters. Will definitely come again"}
{"text":"This place situated in the distillery district where there are no chain restaurants. The entire area the food was expensive so this restaurant as well; however, me and my friend had an great experience at this place! though the food was expensive but the atmosphere was good and our waitress was nice! We had a bottle of wine and I ordered their specialty which was the raw oysters on the half shell (Rasberry Point) there were SOOOO good! Best oysters I ever had though i paid 21$ for 6 but it worth every penny! I would recommend this restaurant if you could afford it. This was our only expensive meal out of the whole trip."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday evening. The distillery district was pretty busy. The patio outside was really busy and we decided to sit inside. The patio was pretty big and looked welcoming though. The waiter who served us was great super friendly kind of reminded me of Blairs step-dad from Gossip Girl. He checked back periodically to make sure we were enjoying our meals.  I had the seafood mac and cheese and it was absolutely delicious. There was tons of seafood in the dish. Lots of salmon,shrimp and scallops. The dish was super tasty and filling. The portion was large and it was full of seafood they are definitely not skimpy on it.   Id recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice seafood downtown Toronto. Not a fan of oysters so I didnt have any but they have a big variety so Im sure if youre a fan you can find something you like."}
{"text":"I am giving it 5 stars because the food was amazing, I loved the ambiance, the people who worked there were very friendly, but the service wasn't 5 stars. Our wine was served after the food was sent out, and it was hard to get our server to come to the table. However, the food was SO good. The lobster pasta dish? Ridiculous. I'm so glad we went here during our time in Toronto. It was a blast."}
{"text":"Went to walk around and my girlfriend wanted to enjoy the last weekend of summer out doors so we picked a patio restaurant. Server was extremely slow getting to us. Had to flag down a girl that seats guests to get our server for us and even after that waited for a while. We ordered the Yukon fries to start and my girlfriend had the loaded summer salad and I had to raw platter. The fries were normal but too many small tiny bits. The salad looked okay but didn't taste well. The raw platter too forever to come out and when it came I was disappointed the shrimp weren't cleaned and oysters didn't taste too fresh. The waitress was missing half the time at the beginning and I could see her continuously chatting with this guy at this table. I think she finally knew I was getting ticked off so started doing her job. I didn't leave a full tip in the end but still left a tip and I heard my girlfriend say the waitress gave me a dirty look after. This place needs to train their staff better that's all I need to say. Totally not worth it, wouldn't recommend and wouldn't go back myself, I'm sure there are better options at distillery district."}
{"text":"Very good one, highly recommended. We had an issue with one of the meals, and they've replaced with a more expensive one at no charge.  Very good service, friendly staff and trained professionally."}
{"text":"I love oysters!   Fresh, salty and creamy these slimy little buggers are a gift from the ocean. I'll eat them however you want - raw, grilled, marinated, or soaked in a vodka shot.   Based on this indiscriminate love of these shell fish I was excited to visit Pure Spirits.   The one thing I don't generally love about oysters is the price, but every Tuesday there is a $1.50 per oyster special (all day!) that makes ingesting a dozen (or so) not so financially perilous.   Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. 5 out of 5 for her.   The oysters were great and the p.e.i mussels steamed in Malaysian laksa broth were super tasty, except for the 1 or 2 slightly dodgy ones my friend received.   The Ahi Tuna Salad was nice but nothing amazing. I had the Atlantic lobster spaghettini with wild mushrooms and a black truffle cream sauce. It was OK, but under seasoned and certainly a case of a dish that reads super well on the menu but is underwhelming in person. I expected it to be packed with flavor from the mushrooms and truffles to enhance the lobster but it fell a little flat.   A menu pitched at this price range needs to knock their delivery up a notch.   Nice ambiance in the restaurant. The distillery district was dead on a rainy Tuesday night but I certainly can see it being a great, busy location on the weekend."}
{"text":"Ok let's start off saying I don't like oysters but my wife does so thats how we ended up here on valentines day. Ambience is typical hip restaurant. Service was ok since we didn't have reservations but we had to sit at the bar. Good beer selection. I got the Asian duck leg which was bland but the duck was soft. My wife got the jambalaya which she devoured.  My wife enjoyed but I didn't."}
{"text":"Came to the district expecting a bit more as far as restaurant choices.  We are no huge fan of oyesters but were getting really hungry and did not feel like pub food.  We took a chance in spite of the low ratings and so glad we did.    Neither of us ate oysters, but I had the salmon which was smoky, flavorful and slightly sweet.  My partner had seafood pasta with clams, mussels and octopus in a spicy tomato sauce.  Both portions were ample and the ingredients were fresh.    We shared the French fries with parmigiano and rosemarry.  10 bucks is a lot to spend on fries, but I tell you what....days later we are still talking about how amazing they were.  They came with 3 dipping sauces....aoli, vinegar and a spicy ketchup.  DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT ORDERING THE FRIES.  Thank gawd they don't have these at home.  I would weigh a thousand pounds.  We sat at the bar and the lady that served us was awesome too."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Atmosphere was amazing. Service was fantastic. I definitely would come back. Especially for the Calamari Tempura (had to be MY favourite)."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is, it was over priced and very \"Red Lobster\" like. The food was quite tasteless. I ordered the salmon and my friend ordered the steak and lobster dish. It was nothing special. Skip this restaurant and move on to the next!"}
{"text":"Located in the busy Distillery district, it is easy to walk by and miss Pure Spirits with their simple and understated facade, especially with the more eye-catching El Catrin, Cluny Bistro and Mill Street Brewpub. But if you give it a chance, you will find it to be a worthy restaurant to dine at.  The inside of the restaurant is cosy. There is a nice outdoor patio area as well.  Me and my dining companion started our meal with some oysters. There was a very good selection of oysters from both the east and west coast, but my favourite of the night was the Coromandel from New Zealand. The pricing was not cheap, even when accounting for the quality and size of these oysters, but this is to be expected given the restaurant is in a heavily touristy area. I was delighted to find out that they do buck-a-shuck here on Tuesday nights for good sized PEI malpaques, and am already looking forward to doing that for my next visit.  We also indulged in some Vermouth tasting and loved the presentation: The red Guerra vermouth was presented in a round bottomed glass flask. Orange slices were caramelized with a flame and placed into the glass with ice, and the red vermouth poured over. This was paired perfectly with a pork hock croquette, which was delicious!  We shared all the mains afterwards:  Ceviche of Pompano, with leche de tigre, sweet potato, corn nuts, cilantro, poblano pepper and shallots: This was a refreshing appetizer and I loved the fact the acidity of the leche de tigre was balanced out by the sweetness of the sweet potato. The corn nuts gave nice cripsy textures which is a nice contrast to the cured fish.   Calamari Tempura: An interesting take on the classic calamari, with a light tempura batter. It was quite enjoyable with the lightly sweet tamari dipping sauce.  Vietnamese style Florida snapper: The fish was perfectly cooked, and the Vietnamese satay sauce was great with it.  Yellowfin Tuna poke: A good sized poke served in a cast iron (?) pot. The presentation was lovely. However this dish was a slight miss for us as we thought the sauce given to mix in the poke was perhaps a bit too much, resulting in a poke that was just a tad too salty. We also thought the pricing for this dish could be a bit better ($31.95) especially since there are a ton of cheap poke places in Toronto, but we did noticed that the ingredients used were high quality.  We finished our meal with the white Guerra vermouth tasting, which was presented much the same way as the red vermouth. This was paired with a delicious orange almond cake.  Service was impeccable during our meal and we really enjoyed our experience here.   Overall, I would rate this restaurants 4-stars, and stop short of giving it 5 stars given that I think pricing could be improved just a bit (Cluny Bistro next door is a tad more competitive with their offerings in terms of pricing). I think Pure Spirits would be a fine place to dine with their oyster specials."}
{"text":"OMG one of the worst fine dining experiences ever. for the prices they charge, i'd expect way more. just because theyr're in the distillery district they think they can charge those prices but it's so totally wrong. their whole restaurant smelled awful, like rank fish, but not just rank fish, but when fish gets past the point of rank and starts to smell like fecal matter. like the zoo. yuck! i even had to send fish back... it was so bad. i don't remember the last time i've sent fish back. mussels, yes, at cantine in yorkville during summerlicious (horrible), but fish?! usually restos can cook out that rank smell but that smell was completely embedded in all of the fish had to offer. i can tell you one thing, that pure spirits is purely rank... pure bacterial culturing going on on the surface of all fish and seafood here. the whole resto stinks and the food was awful.  i went there because of their nice website and a friend wanted to try but both items i ordered (whitefish, then sent it back to the kitchen and ordered the calamari) were not so fresh. you could taste the fecal/rotten fish/zoo taste. I don't know what else to say other than it tasted like what the zoo smelled like, which is animal poo, which is waaay too much bacteria!...meaning it went bad. toronto has such low standards for fine dining, and i say that as someone who's lived in toronto my entire life! i just get to travel and taste food from other regions and i realize that we could be doing much better than what we have to work with. awful. never go. WAY OVERPRICED... the patio is nice and the service is friendly (but fake).. definitely not worth the price, even if fresh. the ingredients were very basic and no culinary expertise went into it at all. probably one of my worst seafood dining experiences in a while!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful day it was today! The Pure Spirits patio was the perfect place to soak up the sun. The cobble stoned Distillery District provided a nice backdrop. The patio was pretty big and apparently quite a popular mid-week lunch spot. We had to wait at the bar and enjoy a bevvie before we could be seated. The short wait proved to be worth it though. Sitting inside wouldn't have been the same at all on a day like today.  My friend and I shared a bottle of sauvignon blanc ($45) and were quite satisfied with our selection. We dined on: surprisingly creamy (really, it looked like there was a lot of cream in it, which was most unexpected) sweet potato soup ($9); ungreasy dill battered fish and chips ($15) served with an apple celery root slaw that my friend is now inspired to try making at home; ahi tuna sandwich ($17) interestingly topped with tomato, bocconcini, alfalfa sprouts, and avocado which wasn't amazing until I asked for a side of pungent dijon mayo to add to it.  I would be interested in coming back for a pre- or post-theatre dinner to see how different the atmosphere is. If you don't have a whole lot of dough to blow, rumour has it that they've got a condensed menu featuring \"buck a shuck\" oysters between 3-5pm!"}
{"text":"Pure Spirits was my first encounter with the Distillery District. As soon as I walked into the place, I could feel the age and I instantly got the style. The room is great, the patio huge and the atmosphere inviting.   UNFORTUNATELY.....  Because we didn't have reservations, and apparently their patio was fully booked (empty when we arrived) we were ushered around the side to their \"IBIZA\" drinks patio. It was nice enough, but it didn't have the energy of the actual room and patio. IBIZA also only had one server handling about 10 tables, and no sort of support around him. That considered, he did a fantastic job and had a good sense of humour.... especially considering the situation.   The prices are expensive, and with that I guess I expected a higher level of attention as far as staffing goes. By far the busiest area of the resto was the IBIZA casual patio, and it was by far the most under-staffed. Mind you, we caught them around 7:00 on a Wednesday night, so they may have been preparing for later.  That being said, I liked the vibe, I liked the oysters and I will be willing to try it again. They had a good beer selection, great wine list and the staff that I did encounter were very nice. Stay tuned for an update!"}
{"text":"Got the Malpeque, Raspberry Point, and the Acadian oysters as recommended by the person at the oyster bar. Great flavor and very fresh. The bartender was very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Fantastic Oyster Place, here you are guaranteed fresh oysters of various species, some I haven't seen anywhere else in TO. They also have a great wine selection, which complements the delicious menu perfectly. I personally recommend Gewurz from Alsace with Lobster pasta...it's pure heaven! Service is not intrusive and servers know their menu and can make tasteful recommendations. Will be back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of the Distillery District but this was quite good.  The hostess may need some work around the edges and it is quite loud.  But the oyster selection was excellent and the server was quite knowledgeable.  The wine selection was more than sufficient.  It's all a bit over priced for my tastes but isn't any oyster restaurant?"}
{"text":"The best service!!!! Ambience is great feels like you're the only one in the restaurant! We had oysters which rates fresh out of the sea and coconut musscles. NY chef in GBC owns this restaurant so we got some free dessert and drinks! Thank you! Regards to our server. Can't recall his name but he was shorter and I think south Asian? Anyway he was impeccable,"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and welcoming here! I ordered a bloody Caesar and asked if they could throw in fresh oysters in my drink and  although they didn't have that on the menu they were happy to do it for me.  *In fact if they permanently put that drink on the menu and start selling it like it's going out of style, I would hope I get mine free when I go back ;-) Because I will be back!  The oyster bar master new in detail his product and was really good at describing the different tastes.  Oysters were perfect, cold, fresh and delicious.  The Rosemary Parmesan hand cut fries amazing too."}
{"text":"I still would give a near 5 mark to food but clearly service has to improve.  Last time I went there, my GF told me she found waiters not efficient and not nice but I did not find that obvious. This time I did! More than half an hour to get appetizers then again after, for the entrees. And instead of being apologetic, waiters became pretty rude whereas WE could have, as well as oblivious and totally neglecting for our waiting table!  I will NOT go back there until I hear/read that they worked on and fixed this. Such a pricey place with good food needs good, better managed, directed and well-mannered waiters and staff. Just instruct your staff how to please and respect customers when kitchen is a little bit behind."}
{"text":"Came here around 6pm (on a Tuesday) during the Christmas market and there was a lineup outside of ~6-7 people. We spoke to the hostess and she said we didn't have to wait if we were ok with sitting at the bar. We quickly agreed to the bar seats since the line at boiler house (right across) was even longer.  Their Tuesday special was $1.50 for selected oysters. Excellent deal! The oysters, sauces, and freshly grated horse radish were delicious. Also ordered a main salmon dish. Forgot the full name but it was something like hot smoked Sally. This dish was VERY SMALL in portion...the whole meal was slightly bigger than a hockey puck. It was delicious but not very filling on its own. Honestly, I don't think it was worth paying $27 for.   Ambiance is great and cozy. Overall, nice place for taking your special someone for a romantic date. If you're looking for something a little more economical, walk around the distillery, there are a few restaurants not so close to the main area that has a smaller line and are more budget-friendly."}
{"text":"They're set up as fine dining but the food is really lacking on a lot of fronts. The oysters are amazing, but hey, anybody can get amazing oysters--you just have to buy them, there's no cooking involved!  I had the special last night, a breast of capon with gnocchi, spinach, and asparagus. The gnocchi were so soggy they were almost mashed potatoes. Flavour also nothing special; tasted like they were boiled in chicken stock from a bouillon cube.   The capon was undercooked, a little bloody around the bone, so I had to eat around that. There's nothing less pleasant than underdone poultry. Consequently, the rest of the breast was a little on the gelatinous side and quite unpleasant. The spices rubbed into the breast were completely generic: a bit of rosemary, salt, and pepper. I was hoping for something a little more creative. Also, it apparently came in a hazelnut sauce, but the sauce did not taste of hazelnuts at all, more like chicken stock, so what's the point?  Veggies were fine; it's hard to mess up steamed spinach and asparagus, but they certainly didn't save the meal.  So I would come back, but only for the oysters and maybe possibly try their steamed mussels on the all-you-can-eat night. The chef's cooking is bland and careless, so better to stick with the stuff that comes ready to eat right out of the ocean."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Server took our drink order and never came back to take the food order. I asked for the manager and the server told that the manager shows up once in a while and she would grab me next time he stop by. I explained to the manager the situation and he offered to expedite the food order for me. Since my dead is diabetic we couldn't wait any longer. He brought the check and when he noticed I had the Yelp app opened he offered to take something off the check. He took a sangria off but we still had to pay for a beer and a coke. Toronto is an amazing city and had amazing restaurants. This past week I tried several different places. This is the only one I had a problem."}
{"text":"My lobster, grilled cherry tomatoes, and potatoes were SUPERB!"}
{"text":"Food was good could of been better I found my pasta was good but stuffed in this small bowl over flowing with pasta, my partner had the surf and turf she loved it but it was salty all the elements on the dish was salty, wine was good waiter suggested a wine, 1 sip and I sent it back, we wanted the cookie sandwich with ice cram was really excited to try, only to find out they didn't have any ice cream so fell short, could of had a wonderful review I would go back again"}
{"text":"Did they think PURE means without any spices or flavors????  Every dish we ordered here was cooked for people with blood pressure of 200 or above.  I don't cook, but I know I can cook better than these \"cooks\".  It's like they hired a bunch of dishwashers to do all the prep AND be line cook.  Actually, i correct myself, if dishwashers cooked food, they will have flavor.  DISH SOAP flavor, but these dishes did not have ANY flavor.  On top of all that, front of the house staff were friendly, but moving at a snail's pace.  I'd rather wipe my a$$ with that plastic Canadian money and set it on fire than spend another penny at this horror house of no flavor.  Anyway, if you are wondering here is what we ordered:  -Caesar Salad:  looked like it drowned in Hurricane Harvey, but rain was replaced with Caesar dressing. (Yes, I apologize, this was the only thing that had any flavor) -Crab Gratin:  stay away -Mussels and Fries:  looked like frozen mussels swimming in dark colored piss water... again WITHOUT flavor... -Fish and Chips: now this.. THIS really shocked me.  breading on the fish was not seasoned... fish itself was not seasoned... this fish NEVER tasted salt or any seasoning in its life... like EVER!!  Chips... french fries... THANK GOD FOR KETCHUP!!!! -Lobster Pappardelle:  you know pasta was cooked well just NO FLAVOR AGAIN!!  it was swimming in butter though so that was i guess.... good? -Salmon and Egg brunch thing I don't remember what its called, but doesn't matter it tasted like one of those fake food display models  PS their bread is really good. comes out warm and with salted butter."}
{"text":"***1/2  Our food and sangrias were good. I ordered the chopped salad (chicken, avocados, corn etc) and it had the most delicios cilantro dressing. My friends were quite happy with their meals too. Though it doesn't come cheap I must say.  The staff was funny. We asked for split bills. After they got the bills, we asked if we could pay for the third person 50/50. But they said they couldn't charge the third person's amount 50/50 between the other two on our credit cards. For that they'd have to find the manager again for approval. That's the strangest thing I've heard. I'd lkike to give it 3.5 stars, 4 is too high and 3 a little low."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in the distillery district. I've had their seafood Mac and cheese and their oysters of course. A little pricey but it comes with the atmosphere and the food. Would go for special occasions for sure.  To Rik. O: sorry just noticed your msg!  I definitely look forward to patio weather for our spirits :)"}
{"text":"Don't bother with the calamari appetizer. They prepare it in large strips that prove to unwieldy to consume with out making a mess of your table and a fool of yourself."}
{"text":"Came here for the oysters! We had the dozen mixed platter and enjoyed these with the mild mustard sauce of the three options. The server was helpful and honest (appreciated the heads up on not trying the cocktail sauce with the oysters - seemed like a weird option anyway so I stayed away).   Although the oysters were great, I enjoyed the large serving of the mussels more! The side of fries was a great compliment to the dish."}
{"text":"Great location in the distillery with a nice outside patio by the cobblestone street. With the exception of the \"duo of tuna\", which was pretty good, the food was a big let down."}
{"text":"Service was slow but friendly staff and very accommodating. Food is just not good - got a bunch of different things Mussels - flavoring was good but the mussels themselves were tiny - like pea size.  Paella - rice was way too sour Gumbo - lacking flavor and ingredients. Only one shrimp and about a few pieces of sausage Steak - forget about it - gross cut (although should know better than to get steak at a seafood restaurant right? ) Oysters - fresh, liked the selection! Overall food was subpar and not worth the price. I would maybe just return for oysters and beer/wine."}
{"text":"Remember, just because something is a deal, it doesn't mean that you should eat it!  If something costs $1.50, be careful what you pay for.      My husband and I came here on a Tuesday excited to chow down on some oysters.  We ordered 2 dozen Miyagi Tuesday $1.50 specials.  We sat right in front of the oyster shucker.  It was a little busy for a Tuesday, but this guy was shucking like his life depended on it!  He was really fast, but really messy.  I only saw him smell a few (for freshness) and the oyster shell pieces were all over his hands.    When we got the oysters my husband and I nearly chipped our teeth a good few times because there were oyster shell remnants all over the oysters.  Normally I slurp up the oyster from the shell, but I had to use the fork to pick up the meat and scrap off the pieces of shell.  Not cool....  Also, a few of them were fishy and really small.    Besides the oysters, we also ordered an ahi tuna salad.  The tuna was alright--not too fresh, but the dressing and veggie/lettuce combination were tasty.  We ordered the calamari and it was pretty good.  Just crispy enough with a side of cooked sweet onions.  My only complaint was that the portion was a tad on the small side for the amount of calamari served (and the price!).  One thing that bothered me was that there was a restaurant manager who was hanging around the oyster shucker and asking him if he needed any help. She was holding things in her hand--probably sheets and stuff from booking a large group at the back of the restaurant.  The shucker was getting swamped so she decided to help him.  WITHOUT washing her hands, she started picking up horseradish with her hands and placing it on the platters of oysters.  She also placed slices of lemons on the trays, making sure her fingers touched every part of the lemon. Normally I'm not too grossed out about this, but it was happening right in front of us!  It totally made me think twice about how my food is handled at all restaurants.    Overall, Pure Spirits needs to step it up. It's a shame because it's such a great location and the decor is perfect for a drink after work or a cute date on the weekend."}
{"text":"I booked online with Yelp ( Open Table ) for Valentine's Day Dinner. Reservation system worked perfectly. Pure Spirits called me to confirm and I also recieved an email with full details.  We have been to Pure Spirits before and have enjoyed both service and food. My partner has Celiac Disease and we tend to share gluten free meals. The waitress was very contienous and knew exactly which questions to ask both us and the kitchen. She even split and plated our shared mains.  We started with a dozen oysters on half shell. Extremely fresh and shucked perfectly. Just enough brine and detacted from shell. We like smaller west coast oysters and ended up with two types. Horse radish was fresh shaved and very fine grate.  For mains we shared a Caesar salad (minus croutons) and lobster truffle mushroom pasta (again GF). Caesar was traditional (not creamy) and great. Crispy bacon is nice touch and something I like to do at home. Pasta is very rich and full of flavor. Having a split order was more than enough given the flavors.   We looked to the server for desert recommendation and she made a great selection. Two perfect americanos ( nice crema and water level) with a milk and honey budino.   We had theater tickets for 7:30 and our 5:30 reservation worked perfectly. Stroll down Tank Lane and stopped in a few shops along the walk. Perfect dinner and a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Food was fine enough. Service was disastrous. My girlfriend ordered the seared Ahi tuna and I had the arctic char, and we split a dozen oysters to start.  Everything was going smoothly until, post-oysters, a server brought out our main courses -- a Nicoise Salad for my girlfriend and a \"halibut\" for myself. (I put \"halibut\" in quotation marks, because as I suspected -- and as I discuss below -- it was not, in fact, halibut.) We told her that's not what we ordered and it must be the wrong table. She apologized and went back inside to conference with the waiter.  15 minutes later she came back with our Nicoise Salad and arctic char. The \"halibut\" had been miraculously transformed into arctic char, as it was clearly the same \"halibut\" we were shown before, only now 15 minutes older. (Not sure how the server thought that it could be halibut, given there was no halibut on the menu). Meanwhile, the Nicoise Salad was the same Nicoise Salad we did not order, which we had to reiterate.  At this point our waiter came out to apologize that we must have ordered off the dinner menu by accident as \"the only seared tuna item on the lunch menu is the Nicoise Salad.\" He's only about a quarter right: my girlfriend did indeed (inexplicably) receive a dinner menu when we sat down, although we realized it was the dinner menu when we were discussing what we wanted to order and confusedly couldn't find on our menus what the other wanted to eat. In any case, we did order off the lunch menu -- THE SAME LUNCH MENU POSTED ON THE RESTAURANT'S WEBSITE (http://www.purespirits.ca/lunch) -- which clearly has a seared tuna entree in addition to a Nicoise Salad. Moreover, when he took our order initially, he confirmed we didn't want the Nicoise Salad (!).  What really pisses me off is how somehow this was our fault for \"ordering off the dinner menu.\" I'm always surprised when a restaurant puts the blame on the customer, and in this case, it's bizarrely inexcusable. Moreover, the restaurant made no gesture to us for the inconvenience or the fact that we ended up waiting over 30 minutes to finally receive our main courses. (A comped glass of wine or two would've been nice...at least it would've shown some effort or acknowledgement of error.)  I left an 8% tip but I'm getting worked up writing this review and feel like I shouldn't have left anything.  P.S. I should also mention one of our friends got his main course before his salad."}
{"text":"Great food for oysters and clams. If you're looking for seafood this is a great spot to go to. The server was attentive, and made sure that I was 100% satisfied. The Calamari Tempura and Cod Cake Benedict are the best two dishes on the menu. I also love the decor of the place as it makes you feel like you're at home. If you happen to be in the area, check out Pure Spirits"}
{"text":"Pure Spirits Oyster House & Grill put on one of the best presentations of oysters on a half shell I've ever seen. Not only did it look good, but it was very fresh, nicely chilled and had some great options for flavoring each oyster. I love the rustic setting in the restaurant.  If we're ever in Toronto again, we'll be back to Pure Spirits Oyster House & Grill as well."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant in all of Distillery District.   Came here with my grandparents and boyfriend for brunch and didn't have any expectations.  As we headed towards the patio seats I noticed the patio was basically empty compared to every other restaurant we walked by. I didn't think anything of it and we sat down. The menu is extremely small.. -Of the 3 or 4 entrée options they all contained pork.  -2 salads to choose from that had too many toppings and tasted horrible! I don't even remember the rest because everything looked disgusting. My boyfriend ordered a side of sweet potato fries for his brunch ...if that doesn't say the menu was small I don't know what else to say.  The server was missing half the time and the patio was too big to even wave anybody down if we needed something.  All I can say is they need a way bigger menu to cater to more people.. And stop making everything so \"fancy\" sounding and actually make good tasting simple food."}
{"text":"I hope I arrived on an off night, b/c the service was really questionable. The host was friendly and we were seated promptly on the patio. We ordered drinks + oysters + a few menu items to share.   The appetizers arrived first, I would normally expect drinks and oysters first but this was ok. We had to ask for side plates as we were sharing the dishes. One of my friends and I ordered the same cocktail, but hers with gin and mine with vodka. A runner brought them to the table and when we asked which was which, she shrugged and said \"how should I know, I was just told to bring them over\".  She asked if there was an allergy, and we said \"no, but we'd like the drinks we ordered\" (especially when they are $13+ drinks!).   The oysters arrived far later than the drinks and apps and there weren't any accouterments or little forks with them. We repeatedly had to ask for more water, and when more guests joined us, we had to ask if they could order something.   Overall I really enjoyed the food and cocktails - but expected far more from the service."}
{"text":"Came here on a stormy night in the midst of the Christmas Market. The wait was ~30 minutes in the rain and cold but luckily there was a heat lamp. Moans and groans about the weather aside (something the restaurant was not responsible for), my friend and I were seated and promptly greeted by our server.  We had about 2 dozen oysters (fanny bay, kusshi and kumamotos), sweet potato fries, salmon and bottle of red. I think the standout order was the salmon which was grilled to perfection, juices bursting with every bite and somehow melted in your mouth.   Would definitely recommend but perhaps when the weather is nicer and the patio could be taken advantage of."}
{"text":"We were there on the past Saturday night for a dinner with 4 other couples. The restaurant had very nice ambiance and the server as well as the hostess did the best they could but there seems to be something wrong with their procedures. Our table ordered 4 orders of the chef picnic and one couple ordered appetizers and pasta. We also had 2 bottles of white and one bottle of red. The wine took 40 mins to arrive from the time we ordered and the chefs picnic took over an hour from the time it was ordered.  We were told by the server that the oysters will be coming first as an appetizer followed by the rest of the meal but it all came together. The menu appetizers and pastas took much less time to arrive which made for some awkward timing at the table.  When we asked for extra condiments - pepper and Parmesan - the waiter told us that he asked someone else to get it but they didn't do it. The pulled pork that came with the chefs picnic was not fresh and tasted dry and stale. The pasta, although well cooked and flavourful was extremely salty to the point where it was almost bitter. Unfortunately, we did not enjoy the dining experience as much as we had hoped."}
{"text":"I was here last Saturday night and was severely disappointed. We sat on the patio and the table was in rough shape with things peeling off.   When we asked for glasses of ice water, we were given ice cold water. When asked for actual ice, the waiter laughed it off and never brought it.   I ordered the chop salad... very disappointed. I really expected higher quality. Maybe the Distillery District truly is a tourist trap."}
{"text":"As much as we enjoyed oysters there a few weeks ago, disappointed now.  Customer service either suck or extremely stupid. Called for reservations last night.  No reservations. But you cannot get there without a reservation.    Weirdos!  Just say you don't want any business.   There are plenty of other oyster bars around."}
{"text":"The Toronto Distillery District is charming.  They did a spectacular job restoring this area while making it current, relevant and a destination for locals and tourists alike. Several blocks of 19th century historic industrial buildings and cobblestone streets transform you back into Dickens novel, especially in winter when the streets are not filled with tourists.  Restaurants with lovely outdoor spaces and shops line the streets.  Pure Spirits is a charming, warm welcoming space with rustic plank floors, exposed brick and large window and true timber loft ceiling.    Welcoming staff seated us without reservations.  The place soon filled up.  Food was quite tasty.  I had the gnocchi and seafood paella both of which were very good.  A nicely recommended Pinot Grigio  paired the meal.  My dinner partner slurped fresh oysters and enjoyed a pappardelle, also excellent.    Two large parties (one party 16+ ladies) overwhelmed our waiter, who was really trying to keep it together but the swirling madness soon caught up with him, so I forgive some of the service unravelling as I watched him do the same in a French/Canadian sort of way.  The hostess charged my phone for me while we ate, which was very sweet."}
{"text":"A little pricey for the food and service, wasn't getting what was paid for.. We had to leave our table by 6:30 because they were busy, but we left at 6:50ish tehehe.  Our waiter wasn't smiling,.. seemed arrogant. Oysters were alright :/ nothing too amazing that I'd come back for.  I had the Nova Scotian Lobster Pappardelle, and it was yummmmyyyy :) :) My bf had the Mac 'n Cheese, with only one small piece of smoked salmon. My little disappointed baby, awwww...  The restaurant looked lovely and definitely an elegant place to take my boss to, perhaps. Customers are nicely dressed here. On other days, I'd like to spend my money elsewhere.."}
{"text":"Came down to the Distillery district for a date.  Nice atmosphere, and staff were friendly and attentive.  We ordered the trout rillettes and calamari tempura.  Both were good.  We had a couple drinks as well.  Overall it was a little on the expensive side when I got my bill.  Like another review below... our restaurant was empty, so they were closing up, and we left, only to see the place across the street still packed.  Maybe it's just a different kind of place, but I thought it odd.  I would like to sample some of their other menu items if I happen to be in the district again.  Menu is pricey, but looks like they offer some intriguing dishes."}
{"text":"The patio at Pure Spirits is a pretty cool place to hang out with a drink and grab some food.  I actually hate oysters but they have a lot of other seafoodie dishes to pick from. They're a bit pricey, but hey it's the distillery district.  I LOOVE shrooms so I had to go for the mushroom and lobster spaghettini! Wild mushrooms and lobster is win... especially when they mention black truffles!!!! ($24)  Sadly, I couldn't even smell a hint of truffles :( but the dish, though it looked like a pretty small serving, was filling and there was definitely a decent amount of lobster and mushrooms that lasted til I cleaned up the plate.    Service was attentive and friendly from the hostess and our server.  They had a page of beers, lots of wines, cocktails ($10) and martinis ($11) so I would consider coming back here for drinks on the patio on a nice sunny day."}
