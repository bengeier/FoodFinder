{"text":"It was my first dinner experience with my family.  The atmosphere is beautiful.  The staff is friendly.  It is a restaurant better suited for couples.  My kids are extremely picky eaters and it was hard to find something they would eat.  I ordered the Appetizer Platter that serves 4 for the children to sample.  The dish was well presented.  The platter was delicious.  We were not fans of the Thai dumplings & the red paste on top.  This is definitely an acquired taste.    The kids loved the Crispy Shrimp Sticks, also an appetizer.  My husband and I ordered the everyday special. You pick a soup, get a salad, vegetable spring rolls and choose a main dish.  The wonton soup was good.  The salad was mediocre, the vegetable spring rolls (reminded me of what I purchase at costco) & dipping sauce was good.  I found my shanghai noodles to be a bit oily but the meat was delish!  My husband found his general tao chicken dish to be ok.  The dish was good just not his favourite.   I felt that the server could have filled the water & removed the empty dishes sooner.  Considering the restaurant was not very busy.  But all things considered I would recommend and return again."}

{"text":"I'll give you my honest opinion on this place. I stepped in for a late lunch about a week and a half ago.  The sign said \"Open\" and I waited to be seated.   and waited  .......  and waited.......  .........  and waited.....  There was some guy in the back folding napkins and two other guys on the side having some discussion.  The normal response would have been to get someone's attention and see what the heck was going on. But I'm stubborn and I believe there should be someone who should keep and eye on greeting customers. Call me snobby, call me an ass but I think it's just plain manners at the end of the day.  I left and went to MySushi across the street. The guys there are awesome and always greet you with a smile."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I have learned as a nascent foodie, it's that restauranteurs can rarely go wrong choosing one thing and doing it well.   Witness the orgy of dumpling shops, taco trucks and artisanal charceuterie bars that command our attention here on Yelp, and elsewhere.   Rendezvous Asian cuisine bears this statement out; signage promises Dim Sum and Thai food. the menu drags Vietnamese pho and Japanese gyoza into the mix.   And by reaching for these pan-Asian stars it stumbles badly into the gustatory gutter.   We arrive for lunch around 1 pm on a weekday. There are other diners, which is a good sign. There are comfy chairs and white tablecloths and a menu promising the above, for very reasonable prices.   So we order; a bunch of dumplings, some spring rolls, hot and sour and wonton soups, and my favourite, pho.   The first item to arrive are the Thai wontons; a trio of limp insipid dumplings that look like wads of bloody tissue paper (I can come up with a worse analogy, but this is a family site). They are filled with tasteless chicken and covered in a ketchup-red sauce that tastes like peanut butter would, if you had a cold.   Spring rolls follow; reasonably crisp but stingily-filled, with a weird pasty note that reminds me of the chickpeas I found listed in the ingredients of a batch of reheatable rolls I bought at Wal-Mart a while ago.   Hot and Sour soup should be renamed Sweet and Sweet. It's vegetarian, but mostly bereft of vegetables. Wonton soup is wan, the 'tons likely a replay from the Thai dish earlier. Gyoza and Siu Mai both feature chicken. Both are meh.   I'm glad this wasn't my introduction to Pho, ordinarily one of nature's most perfect foods. this one featured chewy grey beef instead of tender rare slices, zero veggie garnish (cilantro? shallot? mint? Basil? Bean sprouts? Beuller?), and broth that could best be described as muddy; like someone started with a stock cube and, searching for some animal protein, opted to dump a big lobe of liver into the pot.  The portion of noodles is huge, but the amount of sriracha and hoisin (cutely served in mini squeeze botthles) required to achieve palatability still doesn't make 'em worth eating.   Service is pleasant enough, but there are plenty of good Thai, Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants to go around. If you're in thornhill and your party can't decide which cuisine to choose, just draw straws."}
