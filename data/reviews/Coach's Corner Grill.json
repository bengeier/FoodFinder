{"text":"Great hole in the wall sports bar. Great location to sporting events. Cool run down atmosphere. Good service, cold beer. Good pub grub menu. Greasy juicy saucy cheesy, burgers are good, philly cheese steak is fantastic."}
{"text":"Coach's Corner is the perfect neighborhood bar located off of light rail across from Chase Field.  Great service and excellent food.  The holy bacon burger is delicious.  Wonderful lobster bisque too.  If you are health conscious, they have a very good salmon salad and  hummus platter."}
{"text":"This is the best sports bar in Phoenix. It is located conveniently across the street from the Diamondbacks stadium and a skip and a hop from the Suns arena. The F&B manager Andy is very professional and he has hired a great staff. All the bartenders and servers are friendly and give a positive vibe. I have ate here over 100 times but the cold beer before a baseball game is by far my favorite part. Don't forget they give you 15% off to season ticket holders."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Super nice staff especially Monica and the manager Jeff. Great burgers and a crazy good green chili mac n cheese burrito."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did. Good was quite good. BBQ burger and fries were good. Huge onion ring on top of the burger was fantastic. Big choice of draft beers. Papago Orange Blossom is one of my favorites. Ice cold and Great!
Service was horrible. They finally asked if I wanted a 2nd beer. I said sure. 10 minutes later, I flagged down the waitress and told her to forget it. Took too long to be served. At that point, I just wanted to finish and get
my check. Then, Even though there was food on my plate, and I was still eating, another employee reached for my plate and asked if I was done. I wasn't, but enough was enough. 
Went to the bar to pay, gentleman sitting asked how was everything. Told him food was great, but service was horrible. Didn't know he was one of the owners. He offered to comp the meal. I thanked him, but said that wasn't necessary.
I spent 30 years in the restaurant business. If the crew is hustling  and restaurant is busy, I'll wait forever. But there was no excuse for tonight. Reaching for my plate is inexcusable. Good, good. Service. No."}
{"text":"Best little jewel in downtown Phoenix!! Food is delicious and the service excellent. It is bar food BUT has a twist plus the quality and freshness never disappoints!! Prices are wonderful too!! My family now has a go to restaurant that we always know our visit will be incredible and very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Had a beer and burger on a Saturday. I can understand it is busy on the weekends but I felt somewhat neglected. Other people were helped before my order was taken.  I had to yell for help. My burger was good though, and it did not take too long. They need to work on their people skills though."}
{"text":"We love this place - sure it's busy before a DBacks game.  And yes the food is a bit pricey, you're paying for the location.  BUT... At least they deliver with good quality and tasty food.  The chicken fingers are nicely breaded and fried.  You get a TON of French fries with your order.  The double Devil burger is amazing, spicy and HOT!!!  One of the best burgers in town.  Those green chiles are super fresh and spicy!!"}
{"text":"Wow....game day, place is busy.one waitress, one bartender and one host... Not enough help, beer was cold but not a happening place, like trying to drink a beer in a school cafeteria. Wanted to order food but waitress would never come back to table. Went to Friday's at the Ballpark and was told that they(Coach's) just opened and they(Coach's employees) were in Friday's couple weeks earlier trying to recruit their wait staff.  This place has potential but not sure if it will survive if they don't get their act together quick."}
{"text":"I ate at a few places during Phoenix Comicon 2014. I have to say that Coaches Corner Grill was the best spot. Saturday after 7pm only waited about 5 minutes. They got slammed by our group and a group that included the Hulk and some DOZD. There were paramedics called outside during dinner so that was interesting. Because of how busy it was and the large parties, food took close to an hour but with the conversation and our server being very attentive it felt like no time at all. The mac and cheese is amazing, the wings are hearty and delicious, and they have a bacon CRUSTED burger that was awesome too. The only thing to improve would be to serve the beer colder. That being said, I still give this place five stars. The reason that this gets five stars and not four is because unlike some bar food this food tasted great and did not do a conga line through me within an hour, like most bar food.  It will be a Con regular outing for years to come."}
{"text":"Best place to go before the game. Awesome \"branded\" burgers and scrumptious chicken fingers with the tastiest dipping sauce ever! Today.... We won a FREE Corona. Viva Los Hipanic Heritage Day!"}
{"text":"Out of towners from California, we stopped by here for a bite to eat on our way to meet up with some friends. Loved that I got to taste a beer before I ordered it. I ended up liking it and ordered it. We ordered the chicken nachos. My boyfriend is a little picky so we got a bunch of condiments on the side. Loved they accommodated us! The chicken was tender and the chips were huge and sturdy! The nachos had tremendous flavor. The best part was our service. We arrived a prior to a Diamondback game so it got busy as we stayed awhile and drank our beers. No problem to our server, Monica. She continued to swing by when she saw us empty (or almost!). Would definitely visit again next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Lobster Mac!!!! This place was great! Exceptional service. If you want to try something new you gotta try the Lobster Mac! This Mac and cheese was amazing! I couldn't put my spoon down! The amount of Lobster and Mac shells were pretty much equal! The cheese sauce was superb, very flavorful and at that addicting! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Finally a place for great quality food and drink prior to a Dbacks or Suns game at reasonable prices.  I recommend the SW turkey club, served on sourdough with house made pimento cheese. The Lobster Bisque as a side is worth the upgrade. Buffalo mac & cheese was also good.  Pretty good selection of draft beers with happy hour specials. Staff is good about getting you served and checked out in time for the game. Much needed place for downtown sports district."}
{"text":"The BEST bacon burger ever.  First yelp review because this burger deserved a review. I was visiting Phoenix and was looking for an outdoor place to enjoy a delicious burger without being overpriced. Coach's was the answer. They chop up he bacon and cook it in the burger- AMAZING. Perfect burger. Great service. Great beer specials. Will definitely try and remake this burger at home."}
{"text":"Second visit and the food was absolutely awful. My husband ordered the Wayno's Fried Chicken and it was a burnt pool of grease. The chicken must have stayed in the deep fryer for well past the normal time. The chicken was leather and inedible. After 15 minutes of waiting for the server we sent it back only to get the exact same burnt greasy chicken. My husband then switched to Holy Bacon Cheeseburger rare. The cheeseburger also came out well done (Crispy) and on a dirty plate with stale fries and no Ketchup. I had the Mac and Cheese; burnt and tasted stale, awful.
The service was even worse than before, it was the Dbacks Cubs game and we expected to wait however, friends of the business and staff zoomed right past all of us waiting. Very Frustrating 25 minute wait to get seated. Once seated, I ordered a Grey Goose vodka tonic and my husband a Jack and coke. The vodka definitely was not Grey Goose as it burned my mouth and the Jack and coke was coke with a splash of Jack. The alcohol prices are the highest around Chase Field so, be prepared for sticker shock.
The server never refilled our water (the best part of the meal) and never would give us the Wi-Fi login password. We left as fast as we could."}
{"text":"Great place, great owner, great staff. I often take my kids to this location before/after Suns games. My kids are 3 and 5, they love coach's corner. The staff is always very friendly to them, bring them crayons and make sure the kids are having fun. 
The beer selection is good and they have good food. Their wings are great and I love their salads. 
I highly recommend this place for drinks with your friends or a parent-child outing. Give them a shot, they may give you one back : )  
They don't get a lot of foot traffic and it would be sad if they didn't make it. 
Go SUNS!!"}
{"text":"I'm passing through Phoenix in route to California. I just looked for a sports bar near my hotel downtown. You always have to be careful on Sunday because some bars can be very home team and not open to visiting teams. 

This place wasn't like that. The staff wasn't the most happy to serve me, but they warmed up to me, what I liked about this place was the environment. They are very interactive with guests, bells going off, tossing out free stuff every once in a while. They even have the teams playing below each TV which is a simple enough concept that I would think more people would use it. 

Their menu was hit and miss for me. I had the cheese sticks which were awesome, but I had the Italian sub for lunch and it was less than great. Still, I'd imagine the rest of the food is good because there were lots of things I saw later which I thought \"I SHOULDVE HAD THAT!\" The liquor was a bit pricey for a game day, in my opinion. Stick with beer here. 

Overall if I had a chance to go back I definitely would but I'd pick my food differently, only reason it's 3 stars is because what I had wasn't mind blowing or anything like that."}
{"text":"They kill it!  Went before a Cubs game with a large group and they knocked it out of the park on food & service even though you couldn't walk in the doors it was so crowded.  Great job Coach's Corner!"}
{"text":"Great spot to pre game for our Diamondbacks game.  We shared a really delicious turkey Diablo sandwich. Very good. Also a good place to try new beers. Good spot and friendly service."}
{"text":"Fun place, right next to chase field. Visiting from SF for Dback /Giants opener, great place for a beer before the game. Staff friendly, service good...went back after game for flatbread pizza snack and it hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Burgers are good. Fries can be good but vary in what type they give you based on what you order.  \"Chopped greens\" is code for iceberg lettuce on their menu."}
{"text":"Staff are awesome in this downtown sports bar. I was there to watch football. Food was ok - generous portions but just ok quality-- had chicken strips and a salad-The drinks were reasonable for the pour. There were a couple of pretty loud groups of pretty intoxicated people- yes I know it's a bar- some  were borderline rude and inappropriate to others, not me but just made me uncomfortable.  Just not a comfy vibe."}
{"text":"Food was horrible (we ordered appetizers.. Hot wings (not hot)chix nachos & mozzarella sticks... Blah.. and craft beer was warm. Their cooler has been broke for 3 days, as the manager told us.. 3 days.. And you are located by the ballpark? Get ur shit together..."}
{"text":"Their hours are listed as being open until 1:00am, but apparently it is really whenever they feel like staying open until. We came in just before 10 hoping to have dinner, but were given a menu with 4 items on it and were promptly asked to order because we were holding the kitchen from closing. Terrible service."}
{"text":"LOVE The LOCAL Beer On Tap & Lobster Bisque was to die for. 
Going to a Suns Game? 
Come here First!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night looking for a beer and a bite.  AZ/WI bball & Yotes/wild on TVs, good start.  Sat at a table for 10 minutes and was never acknowledged.  Strange, wasn't very busy.  Approached the bar and asked for water, beer, and a menu.  Rude guy told me I couldn't stand there, gave me my goods and said someone would start a tab after I found a seat.  Back to my table of desolation.  A gent named Corey introduced himself and asked if I would mind moving as a party of 28 was coming in.  Told him it was all good as long as I could see the hockey game.  Service did not improve.  I would flag down any server that looked my way, but still took forever to get anything.  Sandwich came and it was tasty.  Corey came by again to ask who my server was.  Said I didn't know.  He asked if I'd been paying cash.  I told him, no I haven't paid anything.  Ordered another beer with 5 mins left in the game.  Game over, no beer, no server.  Approached the bar to pay the tab.  Guess who I get?  Rude guy!  Shoos me away and tells me to go pay my server.  I was here a few weeks ago, food was great and service was better, but I don't think I'll waste my time again."}
{"text":"Food was good. 3 stars for location, one for good service. Right across the street from the BOB.  I went there before a Giants v Diamondbacks game. Speedy."}
{"text":"Deciding to grab a quick bite before heading to Chase Field for a ball game, we wandered into Coach's.

It's the typical food fare at a pub - burgers and the like. We ordered Bacon & Cheese Tots (like anyone can say no to those!) and carne asada tacos to share. The drink special were margaritas that night so we got a couple.

Tots were soooooooo good, tacos were meh as were the margaritas. 

I can see how this place gets busy, prime locations and relatively cheap eats compared to the stadium.

However, if you're getting margaritas be forewarned that they'll charge you $1 extra for margarita mix! Seriously had I known that beforehand, I would have just gotten straight up tequila."}
{"text":"Ate here before the Cactus Bowl. It was swamped!!  (Made a reservation a few weeks ago, very good idea if coming on a big game night) The food was great, coming back for the lobster bisque. As crazy as it was got our food fast and hot. The staff was awesome!"}
{"text":"My review is based on the evolution of the place over time. Been coming here since it opened, and it keeps getting worse. Today the menu got smaller, and more expensive. This is about the 3rd time this has happened. And they literally removed the best two items from the menu - the bacon burger and the cajun wings. We asked why, and waiter said, \"getting ready for baseball season\". Really? The remaining selection is small and expensive. I will admit what they still offer is good, generally speaking. But this is an expensive sports bar with limited selection. I know a lot of people who have written this place off, and I'm reluctantly afraid that I may have to join them, not that they care."}
{"text":"Great happy hourand great food. The staff was so interactive with us. This is officially a great spot to have drinks before any game downtown. Cant Belive  i have never seen  this place while i go to dback games. This is my official pre-game spot before games."}
{"text":"So happy they opened this up here!  Great place to go for drinks, food, and watch a game!  Try the burger, steak, or lobster dishes.  Staff is very friendly and relaxed too!

Only thing I would change is the entertainment.  They need a pool table, darts, and/or shuffle board.  Maybe a poker tournament every once in a while?"}
{"text":"Love the peach on the beach. Good prices and good meal options. I was hungry wanting something light like a salad but not one of the whole salad options they offer and the server offered me a small one. Very accommodating. Definitely a spot to hit after a baseball/basketball game."}
{"text":"Went in here with a group of friends before and after the Diamondbacks game recently both visits were pitiful. Our waitress that we had I believe her name was Amanda..she was very rude, when she greeted us she threw down the coasters all around the table, she looked very overwhelmed granite it wasn't even that busy, coming from a sever like myself.. Oh and we had her both visits same day. We all order waters to start because we were dehydrated, we then ordered our alcohol beverages and in the meantime one of the managers who was also rude as can be came over and asked us \"so are you guys all just going to drink waters or what\"?  Our response no sir were waiting for our drinks. Anyways I've been here once before with my family and never experienced such poor service from the waitress and not to mention have a manager act that way towards someone. Don't think I'll ever return."}
{"text":"Great spot very close to the sports arenas downtown.
The food here is simple but well executed bar grub. The staff is always attentive. If anything does go wrong they are very quick to fix it. (we had and order of fries arrive cold and they were promptly replaced with some of the best screaming hot, crispy and perfectly seasoned fries i've had in a while. 

The people watching here is great as well. It is right behind a light rail stop so that keeps the entertainment coming. 

Stop in for a cold beer, All American eats and great service!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite to eat before the Suns game.  Very loud atmosphere with some outdoor seating.  Service was ok, for being busy it was understandable,  Food was really good, had a burger and fries, and the kids had the pretzel sticks appetizer.  Pretzel was tasty, soft and warm, dipping sauce lacked flavor.  The burger however was excellent.  Why only 3 stars...the bathroom.  It smelled like a toilet in the toilet.  I'm a realist, and didn't expect roses, but the floor was wet, the iced trough was old school, and the smell of pee strong.  And this is right next to the entrance to the kitchen.  It's a sports bar so perhaps there were a lot of misses, but still...it was bad."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great staff! Their lobster bisque is definitely a pleasant surprise and I have yet to order something off the menu that I haven't enjoyed. They have a wide variety of beers on tap that rotate on occasion. They are right off the light rail and located next to the baseball field which make its the perfect stop before and after a game! Stop in for a Paint Nite event a couple times a month to for a great change of pace!"}
{"text":"Was ok...for quick. But, did notice several fruit flies. That usually indicates and cleanliness issue. Staff was nice, but, not as proactive."}
{"text":"$10 mini buckets? You got me in the door. New server was friendly and funny. We felt great that they turned on golf for us- it is the playoffs. We even ordered a second bucket!  And then things went south.... Turned off golf for soccer - really? 70s music playing? It is 2015. 
I guess we learned this is a great place 2 hours before the Dbacks game but once it gets busy- don't expect much."}
{"text":"We were in town for a playoff pop warner game. 50ish people looking for a place to eat and watch some sports. This place was the best on all fronts. Food was good to great. My blu burger with fries was great. Service was great. Prices were fair. We liked it so much we made plans to come back the next day after our game. They were again great on all fronts....especially since we had to drown our sorrows."}
{"text":"Drinks were served tasting light and not what we ordered. Unfortunately when this was brought to out servers attention, we overheard employees using unsavory language towards our party. We promptly left, walked directly next door and had a fabulous time."}
{"text":"BUSY is the one word to describe this establishment on a Dbacks game day. Seriously first stop headed E on the way to the stadium on the light rail. It's like a beacon of refreshment of chilled cocktails & cold beer on a 107 day in the PHX. I'm happy to report they had ample seating/standing inside & a misted shaded outdoor patio & handled the large crowd like pros which is more than can be said for quite a few places around Chase Field. So that's why they get 4 stars even without me trying a bite of food. I have to admit though after perusing a menu it just looked like typical bar fare nothing to flood the calorie gates for. So I can't say I'll be doing that any time soon but definitely enjoyed the atmosphere, crowd & quick service."}
{"text":"Was disappointed, used to go to the Coach and Willies down the street, and do go to the Coach and Willies in Chandler.   Big difference,  the day we were there they were short handed on a Saturday afternoon.  Noisy,  slow service and had one beer and left after we couldn't get the time of day.   Looked like the Mgr. was trying to help.  There was a Civic Center event of some sort.  We drove from Chandler to try it out..  To top it off we had to sit at the bar next to a couple that looked homeless and was sharing a beer.   Gave it 3 stars just because of Coach and Willies respect."}
{"text":"Loved that it was walking distance from hotel. Steak sliders and chicken fingers are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"So this place before a concert is at a perfect distance from the Talking Stick Resort Arena. It was very loud as a walked in, but that is totally manageable. We were seated and immediately served by a nice and attentive waitress. So far so good. 

I kinda liked the vibe in here, and beer is beer and we didn't have any complicated drink orders in addition. Drinks came fast and correctly. Still good this far. 

The crowd drawn from the heavy metal band that was starting in hours, had the place packed with the metal crowd and they are always an awesome bunch. 

We ordered food, and again not much wait - waitress on par, fast and sweet through the whole ordeal. But that's where our good times took a turn. Every meal order, although correct, was quite bad. I didn't expect much - not from this kind of place - so my bar was already set low, and somehow the food limbo'd underneath said bar. 

I can see myself come here for a drink in the future... for the location, and service.. but there is no way I am eating here again."}
{"text":"Me and the boo were looking for a quick place to grab lunch before our errands so we found Coach's Corner. We were both super excited because we had heard the lobster bisque is amazing. While it was great we found it over priced for all the hype! A cup was $8.50 and not worth it. But their happy hour menu being pretty small it had some banging deals!"}
{"text":"(bald) Bartender, extremely rude. This review  would be too long if I listed our conversation. I spoke to a manager, about his \"treatment\" toward us. The manager apologized and bought us a beer. That was nice of him but I hope the bartender will work on his \"people\" skills. 

The place wasn't very busy, an hour or so, after a Dbacks game. We didn't eat. I've heard good things about the food. Baldy Bartender put a downer on us wanting to stay longer.  I do like that they have a few tvs. There was no way that I was going to ask the bartender to change the station, lol."}
{"text":"Standing at the little outside bar before Dbacks St Louis Cardinals game on 27 August. Chatting with bartender who was nice enough. Ordered a bucket of beers and pretzle which was good. Problem was I could see into the kitchen, beyond the little curtain thing they had up... well I noticed what appeared to be a hispanic guy (shorter stocky build, long dark hair pulled back into kind of a tail) wearing a hat backwards. He reaches into his lower lip and pulls out what appears to be a big wad of chew. Now I don't have a problem with people chewing tobacco but in the kitchen working over the grill? he turned right back around and kept working on the grill. Never saw him leave to wash his hands. He was not wearing gloves. Then he walks around the other side and starts handling what appear to be hamburger buns in baskets awaiting to be prepped and sent out to customers. Nasty man....nasty. have some care and consideration for the people who eat what you touch!"}
{"text":"Came in before a game sat down and ordered a round of beer. About 15 minutes in bar manager/tender takes another order for us. Before filling order he says we have to leave because he can't \"hold\" the table for us. Wtf. Why did u seat us and take our orders.  Looking around there was open tables everywhere and other patrons drinking."}
{"text":"My first time going here 11/13/17 decided to have some food and drinks befor the suns game. The nachos were delicious and it fed 2 people, we both got full. Beers were good price and was given one free for a beer taking a little longer then expected it wasn't a big deal and we didn't even make a fuss about it at all it was very nice of the manager. The customer service was great I will come back before any game I go to."}
{"text":"Went for opening day...it was crowded & some people asked us to join them at our table. Waitress refused to serve us because we \"joined\" a table. She stated that the management \"was onto us\". Ummmm, it's a bar! Ok...we met some people and we're having a good time. Wouldn't go back here...ridiculous."}
{"text":"15 bucks for 2 x 20 oz beers before Dbacks game last night....not cold and in plastic cup....complained my first Dos Equis was not cold....girl at bar had no clue how to resolve....as to price she said cheaper than in ballpark.....

Place was mobbed but please"}
{"text":"This has quickly become our go to spot before games. We grab a beer that is much more reasonably priced than all the venues around, and then another! We have tried the chicken fingers, they are good but not great. The regular wings however are fantastic. We will have to give some more of the food a try! Service has always been good and fast which is nice if you are just stopping in for a quick one before heading to the games."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. They don't pay attention to their orders at all. I placed a delivery order through Uber Eats for Mac and Cheese and paid $5 extra to have shrimp added. My order arrived without shrimp. When I notified them they said they would remake the order and when it came the second time I STILL had no shrimp."}
{"text":"From Texas, had to stop by coach's corner for lunch. Great spot to eat and have beverages!!! The bartender Lyssa was awesome,  I will be back next time in town"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for pre/post event dinner, food, or drinks. Service was much faster than expected and they were packed to the brim!"}
{"text":"First visit here and definatly not my last! 
Great food and even better bartender! Joe was great and made sure our visit was comfortable and enjoyable"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Love the atmosphere and service but mostly the food.... The wings and other apps are pretty awesome.... Not a huge fan of their mac & cheese cause it lacks salt in my personal opinion but my husband swears by it... The staff is very friendly and the prices are good, the only think I dislike about this location is how crowded the tables are. Their tables set up is way too close to eachother and it can get uncomfortable.... Overall, we enjoy Coach's Corner whenever in the area :)"}
{"text":"Our whole group was very unimpressed. From the time we put our name on the waiting list to the time we left, we were there for nearly 2 hours. 

I understand that it's a sports bar setting, but the music was so blaring loud that I couldn't hardly hear a thing. We waited SO long for our food that I became sick from having an empty stomach and all the people smoking cigarettes just a few feet away. 

We all got a coach burger with different toppings and the waitress had no idea which one was which. Nobody brought us napkins and the bathrooms were not well kept. 

The food was not impressive. The burger was okay and the fries were not appetizing. The girls working really only seemed to care about socializing and showing off their assets instead of actually working. 

Our waiter was nice and he tried to make sure we were taken care of, but honestly I will not come back here."}
{"text":"Great place to go to watch sports events and they had some good specials. Staff members were fun to joke around with and for some reason almost every one of them were beautiful brunettes!"}
{"text":"Ok this place surprised me - sports bar with awesome food?  Kind of an oxymoron but not this place!  Wow.  That's all I got.  Wow.  Ok one weird thing - in the men's restroom is a urinal that looks like a horse trough.  Cute idea.... Until another dude stands next to you to also use the trough and has to start the sword fight, man.  Get two normal urinals and this place gets 10 stars!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a pre-concert meal at this bar and grill near Chase Field. The same company also has a new taco bar concept down the street, but they decided to have a grand opening closed door party instead of letting 20,000 concert attendees access. Dumb decision. This bar was decent - it used to be at a different location. Most of the food prices seemed jacked up a few dollars, but we split a large Philly, so we won the battle in the end. Very good quality ribeye steak with provolone and onions served on a very soft roll. The hand cut french fries also were the co-stars of the show. The bartenders were nice and friendly and it still makes way more sense to eat outside of Talking Stick because the food choices inside are not of this quality at all and had even higher prices."}
{"text":"Having spent the night before at a downtown hotel after a concert, we were looking for a place for breakfast. Okay, maybe not *breakfast* exactly - we'd closed down a pub at 0200 and were calling the desk at 0300 to verify checkout time, but I digress.

So around noon on a Sunday we stopped in at Coach's. I love its feel of a local joint that may have been around for 50 years. The service was terrific from the hostess, the waitress, generally everyone we observed.

For a small sports bar which has certainly not been around for 50 years, the food is phenomenal! I have a weak spot for lobster bisque, and theirs is outstanding. Good and thick with the usual small chunks, as well as what had to be an intact seventeen pound slab.

Fish tacos - the young lady ordered these. I had one many hours later, and it was cold, but it was delicious.

In what universe would you expect to find \"Hatch Chile Mac & Cheese\" in a sports bar??? Very filling and so, so tasty. I took about half of it home and yes, it's good cold, too.

Bloody Marys were perfect. Heinekens were frosty.

Note to self: Add Coach's to list of favorite downtown establishments!"}
{"text":"Sweet little spot situated perfectly between the ball field and US Airways Center.  Never heard of it but it got great reviews on Yelp so we gave it a whirl before the Lady Gaga show.  

The Hatch mac n' cheese was extremely tasty and my friend's nachos looked delish.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Extremely reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Good, little spot in downtown Phoenix for a pregame Diamondbacks or Suns game. The bar area is smaller than most sports bars, but there are plenty of HD TVs surrounding the seating area. 

Happy hour drink deals from 3-6 are decent ($4 wells, $3 Coors Lights, $1 off regular drafts). The food options are so-so, however.

If you're looking for a different option than Cooperstown or Game Seven Grill, give the Coach a shot."}
{"text":"Great staff.  Overpriced food and beverages. Small portions for a premium $$$$ price. Wait staff friendly and accessible but could not compensate for the overpriced bar food. Wings were small and few in number for a excessive price"}
{"text":"This place does not know how to make a decent mixed drink. My daughter first drink was not was she ordered, then there was a bug inside her drink. She ordered another drink, something very basic but it was too awful for her to drink. I wouldn't go back. My drink was ok, so it gets two stars."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service even when they're super busy and I love love love their lobster macaroni and cheese is the best macaroni and cheese ever"}
{"text":"Great place to have food and drinks before a ballgame. The prices are aren't too bad and the food is very good. I recommend going early on game days because this place gets very busy."}
{"text":"They make a nice sandwich, plus they're close to the Light Rail. Too noise for my tastes tho', probably won't be back...three times and you're out."}
{"text":"Wel I'm giving this place a 3 starer.. It's a good place but the service is no Bueno. We were waiting for our check for 30min after we were done eating. We had to ask for a check. That is not good. But the food is good I expected a larger portion for my Mac and Cheese but it was a smaller dish..

I would be coming back but I'm not 100% sure."}
{"text":"Most obvious is the great location close to the ballpark and downtown phoenix.  

Loved the variety of menu items and atmosphere.  Unfortunately should have been a tip off when soup came out cold.  We asked for them to warm it up and after they \"nuked it in the microwave\" it tasted funny and was sick all night and well into the next day.  

Sometimes things happen, may try again, but definitely not their lobster bisque..."}
{"text":"This place right across the Phoenix Convention Center South side. I needed a quick lunch and decided to just cross the street and try this place. 

Customer service is awful (they seem to just gather in one place and chit-chat instead of checking up on their customers), but the food was good. I ordered their wings in local dry rub and my sister opted for their hamburgers. Definitely the food was delicious considering it's hamburgers and wings."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday football based on the good Yelp rating but am leaving disappointed. Service was non existent, we even had to go up to the bar to get new beers. The food looked and sounded like it would be great, also very disappointing. We had the chicken tenders, hot wings and the \"famous\" mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is the same as you'll get anywhere, not bad but not exceptional and also a little greasy. All of the chicken tasted like rubber with no flavor at all. Other than the location, which is very good, there's not anything I can recommend about this place."}
{"text":"I went with my friend before the Dbacks game yesterday night.  I had the lobster bisque.  So So So good.  I also added a little bit of Sriracha to give it a little spice...... was even better!  My friend had the shrimp guacamole which we were surprised by how much shrimp we actually got.  More than enough shrimp and the perfect proportion to chip ratio.  I would do a 30 minute drive down here just to eat here.  Highly recommend trying these two dishes."}
{"text":"Another great addition to downtown! Great food, top notch service and good cocktails.  In fact, we went two nights in a row it was that good! Really glad they carried some of the same menu items over from Coach & Willie's to this new place. Ask for Misty at the bar and she'll take care if you!"}
{"text":"The service was very attentive at first, then the wait person switched at it was less attentive. The food was good and there were many TV's to watch the game on."}
{"text":"Shalomin, this beeeesh! She's the best! She works special events, but no joke she's the only reason for me to come back. Her vibe and awesomeness is for the books. Thank you."}
{"text":"The food is so good. I go here every year during phoenix comicon or if im in the area. The service is usally lacking and slow but the food and drink make up for it. Nice patio seating area as well."}
{"text":"We have been to Coach's Corner on a number of occasions before a D backs game.  Get there early to get a good spot and get to the ballpark.  This place stays busy all game day and afterward.  you can also ride the train and get dropped off at their front door."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised that a place so close to chase field was so good! Lively atmosphere, fast service - especially since we went right before the game, great bar food! Everyone at my table really liked what they ordered: chicken strips, hatch chile mac & cheese, sweet chile BBQ wings, fries, burgers. Solid prices."}
{"text":"Quite aggravating when you seat your favorite people first and make us wait. Not a cool thing to do when it is a game night.  Otherwise we had a great service."}
{"text":"Wow now this place is a must go to if you are in the area!!! By far the best Mac and cheese I have EVER HAD!! I got the lobster Mac and cheese. Now this is no measly dish, huge chunks of lobster in an amazing sauce. To die for. I also got the brisket chilli. The sweet, smoky, and spicy flavors were so bold it was heaven for my palette. My friend got the buffalo Mac and cheese. So amazing with nice sized chunks of breaded buffalo chicken, bleu cheese crumbles and all around amazingness. 

Our server Paul was amazing. Super nice. Helped us out with suggestions. And was right on for what I wanted even though I had no clue. You better check out this place when you are in downtown Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Fun newer bar in downtown Phoenix that is starting to get their name out there. This place is located on Jefferson right next to Chase Field and only 1 block away from the US Airways Center.

Staff is extremely attentive and friendly. Other night the owner came around to make sure we were satisfied with our meal. I always love when the owner shows their face. They have good bar food and a great happy hour. 

Only downfall was they ran out of champagne for Sunday mimosa's today!! I don't know how that happens at a bar?! Other than that, you should check it out."}
{"text":"Well, everything happens for a reason. Our original plans for dinner didn't exactly pan out so we walked across the street and found this amazing place. Food was SO delicious! Seriously some of the best burgers we have EVER eaten. Service was friendly and prompt. Prices were surprisingly reasonable considering the location right next to Chase Field. Loved it and will positively be back when we return to Phoenix! P.S. It was pouring down rain the night we were there and the manager lead us through their back door to the parking garage so we could avoid the rain. Nice!"}
{"text":"We have been here three times since they opened and we enjoy going, but we will probably not order food from here anymore.  They have great local beers on tap with average downtown prices. In regards to the food, it has the potential of being very good, but every single food item we have ordered from here (on three separate visits) has come out cold. We ordered the nachos this last time, but their cheese sauce was cold, not even warm. This is a great spot for a drink though!"}
{"text":"I'm going to admit that I'm a sucker for french fries and I really like theirs.  The staff was super friendly to a bunch of us who just wanted to hang out for a lot of hours and just socialize.  My company is moving to downtown Phoenix later this year so I can see myself lightrailing down, grabbing a bite, and heading off to a game or concert.  Fun little venue."}
{"text":"For a sports bar to succeed, they have to understand their clientele. They must get that a bevvy of different tastes will walk through their door; from the deep pocketed to those expecting deals any given time. I feel Coach's really hits a home run and understands...so lets steal home and discuss Coach's Corner Grill:

~Fud/Drink~
Right off the bat, this place is so close to Chase Field I could literally throw a baseball and hit an entry gate. So, given that, you would think they price things up. NOPE! Happy Hour, right before the game!! I was relieved to find good prices on beer and some appetizer specials to munch on. This alone compels me to return next time I go to a game. The drink specials were good, as were the selection of beers. The food looks a tad above par a general sports bar. They have a variety of choices, general bar fare done up a tad. I will get a bite to eat next time, but the people I was sitting around enjoyed their food, no complaints I could hear of. Looking over the menu, I know for sure I will definitely return to try a meal next time.

~Atmosphere/Service~
The barkeep we had was pretty busy with all the fans in the bar, yet he kept a smile the entire time and was very talkative to me and all the Orioles fans who stopped in. Fun guy, took his time on the orders with all of us at the bar and did not ask every 5 seconds if I needed an extra one. I asked about food options next time I came in, and he was very knowledgeable about items on the menu, and pointed out his favorites. It is a smaller space, however, and this place I am sure fills up quick on weekend games. It isn't overly homely, the bar is long enough and they have walls covered with various memorabilia. Its nothing to write home about, but this isn't an issue with great service.

~Extras/Rating~
Only extra I have is to get here early, especially on weekends. I highly recommend this bar. This bar beats any alternatives nearby, and is so close to Chase. They get 4 stars for good prices, fun and upbeat service, variety of food choices, and location to Chase Field. They \"lose\" a star for lack of space and ambiance. Really, those two factor out to a 4 star location in my mind, and a solid addition to the bar scene for the DBacks games."}
{"text":"This is the best place before a DBacks game .. If you eat outside sliders rock..Jason the owner is always available and eager to hear any comments and truly cares. This place just in the last year has ballooned, there's a reason for that, the owner really cares..Misty on the enter bar is the absolute best bar tender always happy go lucky but not in the dim wit since very smart. Take her advice on food. Not as it sounds never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant and I must say we were so looking forward to have a great meal, but ended up very disappointed. Visited during the Volleyball Festival and they were severely understaffed for the large number of folks dining in. So we were often left tracking down our server for attention. 

The menu looks great. We were hoping for much more than what we received for our meals. First, ordered pretzel bites from the menu as our appetizer and had to have our waiter check on them. Unfortunately, what we received AFTER our dinner arrived were two large pretzels and watered down cheese sauce. I had the chicken club, which was under seasoned. The french fries were good though. Husband had the burger, which he said wasn't anything great, and daughter had spaghetti with meatballs, again just okay. 

After waiting for our server to bring us our check, was pleased that he removed the pretzel charge due to the oversight. Just done a little too late to redeem the poor service we received. 

Left disappointed and irritated. Won't be back. Sorry..."}
{"text":"Tonight, we had our annual Dback Nation Christmas Party here & not only was the party amazing, but so were the crew at Coach's Corner. Each member of the crew went above & beyond for us & were very accommodating. Our wait staff kept our drinks filled, checked on us frequently, & kept the food coming at a great pace. They certainly deserve lots of kudos for their superior customer service & they would like to host all our future holiday parties from here on out! 

The food was very tasty! I had the Hatch Chili Mac. It was very delicious mac & cheese with a chili twist. The portion size was perfect for me. I was content & not stuffed afterward. I recommend trying this meal! 

If you're looking for a great place to watch sports, have some lunch or dinner, or just a great place to have drinks with the crew, give Coach's Corner a try!"}
{"text":"OK dive/sports bar for overpriced pub food. service at the bar was just ok... some confusion and miscommunication though. really the only place near the ballpark that is not part of the ballpark. there are a few other options downtown that are better."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after a horrific encounter at another bar.  We were pissed off and the staff here turned our evening around.  Good beer selection.  We asked what awards the lobster bisque had won and the response was \"whatever award we printed online, but I assure you the soup is spot on\".  Plus one for you, barkeep.  The lobster bisque was excellent which is surprising for a sports bar.  I also had the pork belly burger which was pork belly on top of a burger with some pineapple.  A winning combination.  Thank you Coach's for salvaging our evening."}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere.. And all the TV's for sports...I enjoyed this place... Will have to return"}
{"text":"If you go to a ball game, you gotta stop by the grill. Real busy before and after the game and a great atmosphere. Good service for a busy place. Plastic cups after a certain time but that's to keep up with demand!!! It gets busy!! Sweet place to hang though. You must stop by if you go to a game!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Always love when you can go to a sports bar and get quality food. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Awesome place before a game, get here early it gets busy.  Great food and service, the chili is crazy great and the chicken fingers are home made and wonderful!!!!
Great owners too:)
Enjoy!!!!!!"}
{"text":"As a loyal customer and business owner I have to say that Coaches Corner WAS one of my favorite places to go to have a nice beer after a very stressful day at the office. Unfortunately though I have decided to go elsewhere now. The reason being that I do not like how employees handle themselves in stressful situations. 

For instance, I came in one day and overheard the manager Garret mistreating some of the employees. One employee had made a mistake and so instead of taking the employee to the back to discuss, he proceeded to yell and embarrass this employee. 

Ultimately to me, a business owner, that is extremely poor management. Not only was the employee being mistreated, I EVEN felt uncomfortable!! If there is one way to drive away customers, it's doing exactly that! This is not the first time I've seen Garret do something like this either. It's happened multiple times to different employees. 

I'm no expert, but bullying and harassing someone for an error they've made is an extremely poor way to, A: handle business, B: keep employees, and C: keep your customers!! I was appalled by Garrets' behavior and will never return to Coaches Corner again."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in after a women's expo at the convention center for a bite and I was pleasantly surprised! The food was great, the service was quick and the atmosphere is fun. I definitely recommend this place for anyone downtown looking for a yummy meal (especially the protein bowl with chicken!)"}
{"text":"Use to be a big fan of Coach's Corner, now not so sure. Some friends and I had an after work get together and I recommended Coach's Corner given previous experiences. Sadly, much has changed. Upon arrival and inspection of the menu it was disappointing to see the entire menu appeared to have changed. Wait staff confirmed this. My favorite steak salad, which was awesome, was gone, along with other great grub. So with that said, I settled for the power salad.  While waiting, a look throughout the joint and one could see they were short on customers today, like dead quiet. This was a pleasant sight as this establishment usually can be busy. I mention this given I expected to get good service given no one else was there. Sadly, not the case. Grub took some time and finally came out. I had asked for egg to be added to salad, ya that didn't happen. The overall taste of the salad was pretty good but there was little to no chicken. For every 15 bites, maybe a little chicken was to be had. Friends ordered soups that they claimed were subpar and another Philly cheesesteak not only lacked any meat but tasted poor. It had to be sent back. The icing on the cake for me was trying a new beer I was excited about and having it sent out warm. How disappointing. Overall, was frustrated given I selected Coach's Corner for my group to have good and drink and it was less than an average experience. I may try the joint again given past experiences but it may be time to find better downtown eats before ball games."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Super Bowl after we were told that their restaurant was promoting a deal of $100/person for reserved table seating and $50/person for bar seating. We asked the hostess prior to committing to seats if they planned to pack the bar with people and were told that they were only going to allow as many people in the restaurant as there were seats and the reasoning for the high price per seat, which instantly had us sold to watch the game there.  Low and behold, right before kickoff a flood of people come in and crowd the bar area which we would later find out those folks only had to pay a $10 cover for standing room. This really wouldn't have bothered me so much except for the group of  people standing behind us who were heckling us to the point where it was making me incredibly uncomfortable.  I finally had to get up and talk to the staff about the inappropriate behavior by the customer and false advertising by them. Their explanation was that the manager made a last minute change and decided to start offering the $10 standing room cover charge instead. It would be one thing if we were told that they would open it up to standing room later, but that wasn't the case.

As for the food and drinks - I actually really enjoyed all that we ordered.  The bartenders were all friendly and quick to get our drinks refilled.

I do applaud the staffs efforts in monitoring the situation after my complaints, but that did nothing to change the fact that they did not deliver on the Super Bowl experience they had advertised to customers who paid for seats.  I'm sure on any other day this is a great spot to grab some food and drinks."}
{"text":"Great place! Very friendly and attentive staff (Philly). A definite stop if you are by Chase Field!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat!!! Great food! Great service!! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for good quality food downtown. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Not only was the service amazing (even when they're swamped-it's a bobble head give away day). But that was the best Mac n cheese I've ever eaten! I had the buffalo chicken mac and my husband had the lobster mac, AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. Not for the food, or drinks, which was fantastic by the way, but for the staff! Our waiter Andy was EXTREMELY busy, as it was a game day, but you would've never known it by how attentive he was. We never sat without a drink, our food came out hot and fresh, and he was always making sure that everyone had what they needed. To top it off, one of the owners/managers, we believe he said that his name was John, it was really loud, so we couldn't quite hear it, gave us the biggest laugh, when my husband thought that he was Andy, so he handed him our bill and credit card, and said \"oh, I am sorry, I thought that you were our waiter.\" The man said, no worries, and continued walking on his way down the street, but then he immediately turned around and came back- Mind you there was NOTHING that said \"hey, I am supposed to be here\" on this mans clothes, hat, nothing. He said, Oh I'll take that for you... .which was met with a \"ummmm, nooo..\" The best experience at a bar and grill - EVER!"}
{"text":"This is a awesome bar and grill! Plus it it prime real-estate because of its location. I also love the name of the bar/grill. It's on the corner located by the Chase Field and just down the way from the basketball stadium. 

This bar is super cool with its decor. The staff is fantastic! They are So nice, plus they are cool. I enjoyed hanging out here because the atmosphere is fun! People are talking to each and you're not being judged by others. You can come here to relax and chill and have a fun time. Also One of the owners Jeff is a super cool dude. It was great meeting him."}
{"text":"Awesome and friendly staff. Delicious food, and not too pricey. A great place to wait for the ballpark to open."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!! This place is so rad! Get vibe and the staff is super friendly. I travel a lot for work so Yelp is usually my go to for picking somewhere to hang out and eat and drink! This place had rest reviews and I see why! If you are in the area check this place out!!! Delicious food and great energy! Definitely my type of sports bar!!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the closet options for restaurants close to the convention center, so we decided to go for it. I went with my boyfriend the first time and man was a crowded! There was obviously a game going on (everyone in jerseys and team shirts), but we came in in the middle of a video game convention and I was dressed up with a wig and everything. Not only did I get stares and whispers, but our food took forever to order. I ordered their famous lobster bisque and my boyfriend got a burger. We waited about 30 minutes for our food, my bisque was at room temperature and my boyfriend got a super overcooked burger when he asked for a medium and it was really dry. The salad wasnt bad, but the pork belly on his burger wasn't flavorful and way too thick. Won't be coming back to this restaurant again, this is the second time in downtown Phoenix where we got poor service. Maybe were just unlucky?"}
{"text":"Great place!  Bent over backwards for our VB team!  30 pp with a birthday. Randy hooked us up !  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Completely in prepared for a large crowd.  I wonder if they know they are located next to a stadium.  We will see how the food is, but if it is like the service it is going to be bad..."}
{"text":"This has been one of the worst dining experiences in Arizona. Waitress took my order and didn't come back to check on me until 45 minutes later offer to get me my check and no lunch yet... she grabs my burger from the kitchen threw it on the table and kept running. Burger and fries are ice cold. No one has come back at all. So sad!"}
{"text":"Went back that same week and everything was 100% better! Service, food, the whole 9! Must've just been a bad and/or busy day. So glad this experience was better! Cant wait to return."}
{"text":"I was here the first time in the fall of 2014 but more recently the first week (Sunday) of March.  It was the first place we went to after checking in at our hotel. Had the previous visit etched in my brain. They didn't disappoint!  Food is great here and service is fast and friendly. No need to go anywhere else!  See you all next time!"}
{"text":"Great place to hit before Baseball, events at Talking Stick or if your at the Convention Center. Has a great selection of food, including healthy options. Beer is always cold too!!

You can also buy water and snacks to take into the baseball game. Sooo much cheaper than at the stadium."}
{"text":"Great location, right next to Chase Field and right in front of a light rail stop. The atmosphere is an upscale/trendy sports bar. Plenty of TV's if you can't get into the game. The food is amazing. Mac n cheese with chicken is a must, along with their Lobster bisque that is more like a chowder with chunks of lobster in it. Burgers were dynamite -  juicy inside, slighty crisp outside, with bacon and bacon mayo (Holy Bacon burger). Nice briosche bun that they brand teh top of with 'CC'.

The bar and drinks is top shelf. Drink menu is creative, all named after a major league baseball team. My fiance drank the 'Cincinnati' all night, named Pete's Punch after Pete Rose. I had beer and teh El Pres margarita made with Herradura reposado and a side blanco shot.

The staff is friendly and fun. we spent 5 hours there on Saturday night and never were rushed or hurried. Everyone was smiling and having a good time. Our waitress stayed and talked with us for a while even when we were just winding it down before driving home. We can't wait to go back and share this place with friends!!"}
{"text":"This is my husbands and I staple before any baseball game we go to. If you get there in advance there are seats available but once you get closer to the game it is packed! 

They have a decent beer selection and the food is also really good. Last time we stopped in I had their dry rub wings and they were actually very good. I'm from the Midwest and as a bit of a wing snob, I was pleasantly surprised. We stopped in AGAIN after the game and I had their chicken strips which were delicious. Battered to perfection!  The hubby had a burger and said it was amazing.  The burger was huge and looked nice and juicy.

Highly recommend this place whether you are going before a game or even if you are just in the area. The staff has always been really nice and if you're lucky, Baxter will make an appearance."}
{"text":"Great location,  good service and great food. Has plenty of TV's to watch with a variety of sports to choose from."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way to a Diamondbacks game.  I had the BEST meatball sandwich I've ever had in my life! The meatballs were moist, flavorful, and simply amazing!   The Italian roll was fresh, and very tender!  I am a meatball lover, and creator!!  I would die to be able to replicate this meatball.... I just might die trying! 
Highly recommend this place!!! Will definitely be back to Coach's!!"}
{"text":"Service on the patio was terrible today after the game. She was eager to get our order, but never came back after she delivered our drinks. Almost had to beg to get our bill.  Went inside to pay the bill and the bartender gave it to a waitress to take to my table. What inattentive to detail. Will certainly tell 20 friends about the poor service and never go back."}
{"text":"After being stranded in Phoenix due to flight issues, we decided to explore downtown after not being back since Super Bowl XLIX. We were hungry and ready for some beer after a frustrating day at Sky Harbor, and found this place as it seemed to have solid bar food and lots of TVs for the playoff game going on. The visit turned into an exercise of trying to wave down someone to take orders, get drinks, and even napkins. One time, we were looking to try something local and finally got someone, only for them to tell us that they couldn't answer our questions cause he was only a runner. By our count, there was 2 servers, 1 runners, and 1 bartender for a place filled with people. The food was fine, but this would have been a classic place for the Bar Rescue people to have a field day with."}
{"text":"I've been to Coach's Corner Grill about 5 times since it opened. Without a doubt one of my favorite downtown restaurants. The friendly staff, lead by Manager Daron make you feel welcomed the second you walk into the place. Coaches Corner is in the center of all the action. Only steps away from both Chase Field, the Convention Center and US Airways Center. What I like about the place is you can get some really unique menu items such as the best Lobster Bisque soup I ever tasted, or their homemade mozzarella sticks. You got to try it yourself  to appreciate their eclectic menu.  This is the perfect place to go if you're heading to a game, concert, or an event at the Convention Center. Just step off the light rail stop. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Sports bar in phoenix! Their new menu is high in quality ingredients & extra large portions. Be careful, the homemade blue cheese is quite addictive. (My PMS cure all). The staff is always chipper & welcoming. Shout out to my fav, Kelsey! 
Must experience Coaches Corner family."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to grab some lunch at and a couple beers. The lobster bisque and lobster mac and cheese is what keeps bringing me back. 

Today we got the soup of the day (chicken tortilla soup), lobster bisque and then my date and I shared the philly cheese steak which was really good. Would recommend checking this place out for lunch if you're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Great staff.

Cheese sticks. Think egg roll meets cheese. Best ever. 

Great place for a pre- or post-game hang out."}
{"text":"Great sport bar welcoming atmosphere.
Good food. Came here for work made a stop to taste the food and services.

No complaint so highly recommended"}
{"text":"I had the Baja Power Bowl ($12) which was amazing and the Bell's Twohearted Ale both were AWESOME!! My husband got the Diablo Turkey sandwich (12?) which he said was amazing! Getting fueled up before the concert!!! Maybeeeeee I shouldn't post this because I don't want it to be crowded.......but they seriously need a shout out!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a Burger. Monica is the manager and does a one on one with customers so it's a different kind of bar. It's a dbacks sports bar that also plays other sports. They do a discount for season ticket holders. My friend Evan introduced me to this place and is a big d backs fan. So I will be returning to this place. See Pili too he's good help"}
{"text":"I went here the night of my company Holiday party for a quick drink before it began. Such a really cool place. Very laid back but efficient and with great service. My date and I even met the one of the owners and were able to chat a bit. A very personable place and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We went as a family before a D'Backs game and I was surprised at how fast our service was. The only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars it was a bit too greasy for me. My daughter enjoyed the kids menus and my husband liked his burger!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and the staff was really accommodating as we requested to sit in a specific spot *and* watch a specific game on a specific network. Food was yum, drinks were cold - glad we found it while in town for a family wedding."}
{"text":"This is NOT a place to go after anything in downtown.  One hour 45 minutes and still no food. Kitchen can't make a hamburger and Mac and cheese in almost 2 hours."}
{"text":"Had a great time after the Dbacks afternoon game.  Chicken nachos were the best I have had in years.  Good food and GREAT service are hard to beat. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"The lobster Mac here had me running back for more, they definitely don't skip on the lobster meat!"}
{"text":"I was in this place back in September of 2014.  I met a friend while I was in town and after we had done a tour of the baseball park.  They have a good assortment of beers and the food is typical bar food.  The service was very good and the one special thing about this place is you could meet someone famous.  I met Tony LaRussa who is the VP Player Operations or something like that for the Diamondbacks, but I know him from his St. Louis Cardinal days. Well, I don't know him like we are buddies, but know of him while he was with the Cardinals.  We also saw Eric Young, Sr. who was with LaRussa in the same bar.  He was a player for the Dodgers and hit the very first home run in Rockies history during the very first at bat in Rockies Franchise history in which he hit it at the old Mile High Stadium back in 1993 before Coorsfield was built.  Young was a Rockies players not a Dodgers player at that time.  Anyway, the place is nice and good place to go to meet a friend and have a beer."}
{"text":"Husband and I came here to watch some Sunday football. When we walked in we were surprised to hear.....nothing. No music no sound from the tv's. What?? This is their idea of a sports bar? We asked the staff to turn up something/anything but they didn't know how to work the sound system and had to wait for the manager to come in later. No drink menus available. Mac n cheese was cold and dry. Chili cheese fries tasted old, only part of the fries that was warm was from the microwaved chili and cheese on top. Chili tasted very sweet, like mostly ketchup. I wish we could get that hour back. Oh and once the manager arrived, still no sound. So strange to come to a silent sports bar and hear everyone's conversation and the baby crying in the corner. Plus the manager decided to take a smoke break with one of the patrons as soon as he came in for his shift. This place is probably still going only because of its convenient location before and after a sports event. Set the bar low for this place and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink during the game and this place was pretty cool. It was fairly empty at the time because they were hosting a high school reunion, but they were happy to have us all the same.

The wings were really good and I'm not a huge wing eater. We got the BBQ and traditional. The bartender on at that time, Misty, was awesome and cute. She shook our hands and was really sweet. She told us of some other good places to check out while we were downtown.

We will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give them another try. Terrible service, terrible bartender. Says they are a sports bar. Couldnt even put on Golfs US open for me. $6.50 for a Sam Adams ! Will never ever return. Will not recommend them to anyone. Sad. Why is it that so many of the downtown bars employ people that think that they are doing you a favor serving you."}
{"text":"We were finally in the area when there was NOT an event going on and therefore this place was not very busy. So glad we finally tried it! We had some good drinks, the kids had real mac 'n cheese, the \"worst\" chicken sandwich was great, and the mozzarella garlic cheese sticks were phenomenal (we were dreaming about them well into the weekend!) We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect much from a place in a prime location such as this but I was blown away by their food. If you are a Mac N Cheese lover you have got to try their mac n cheese! I also really like the chicken fingers. The breading on it is awesome. I would say the only thing left to be desired here is the service. Last time I was in there I never got a refill on my drink and it sat empty after I finished it. Today we were in a rush and made it pretty clear that we were but had to ask the waiter to check on our food to get it. When we got it the fries were cold. Yup it sat there for awhile.... I Was pretty disappointed in that but in too much of a rush to care."}
{"text":"Great friendly place, good for sports bar lobster bisque award winning. Has a healthy menus for those who are watching that waist line."}
{"text":"In town for a Diamondbacks game.  Quick stop here for lunch before going to the stadium.  Service was slow.  Food was alright.  Salad with steak could use more steak.  The fried onion strings added a nice crispy crunch to an otherwise boring blue cheese steak salad.  Enchilada with pork was a generous portion with 3 enchiladas and flavor was good."}
{"text":"This is s very cool place. We stopped in here one night after a show last week, and our was a really good time. Good food, service was pleasant, overall good experience."}
{"text":"Great little place to hang while waiting for the DBacks fans to thin out after a game or for a light rail pub crawl stop. Located right next to the light rail stop for Chase Field.. Domestic bottles are $4 as are PBR cans. Yesterday they had a little 4 piece band in the front window playing for some atmosphere. From the look of the place (ceiling tiles missing.), it appears they may not be quite finished with construction yet. They have a smallish patio on the sidewalk although it was way to hot to sit there yesterday. Haven't tried the food yet, but the beer is super cold!"}
{"text":"If I could rate a zero star, I would!!!

Not impressed by this place at all! I had to seat myself...the person at the front was too busy making silverware/napkin wraps!!

The manager actually came to take my order. Wait for food was a little long. The Jack Fire BBQ Whiskey wings were not spicy at all!!

Also, after showing 10% off bill voucher (from convention), the manager wouldn't take it!

Would not recommend this place to anyone! Shitty service, mod-high prices!
It seemed they were only interested in watching the Titans vs. Patriots game!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service spotty.  But here's my real complaint---get your drunk patrons under control.  We sat at the bar last night.  The drunk next to my friend get handsy.  And touched her.  Commented on her breasts.  And Dropped a napkin into our food.  And the owner's response----I just got here.  I didn't know. 

Bullshit.  Your staff watched this guy be an idiot.  Best part ---you actually charged us for our food, after I had to come off my stool and confront the drunk for dropping his dirty napkin INTO OUR FOOD.   

One star for your staff being stupid."}
{"text":"The food at this place is TOP NOTCH! I HIGHLY recommend the mozzarella sticks and the Worlds Worst Chicken sandwich. I could probably eat that as a meal every day (maybe not the healthiest idea though!!). The service isn't always the best but that's to be expected especially when there's a Dbacks game or concert going on. I have had nothing but good experiences at Coach's and can't wait to get back for the mozz sticks and chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Came here after packet pickup for Rock n Roll Marathon last week. Our server was very friendly and helpful...she gave me a good recommendation for an IPA beer. Also, I ended up ordering the Baja Power Bowl and she suggested replacing the lettuce for spinach...that was a winning dish. 
Wife ordered Coach's Classic burger - cooked well and plenty to leave her with left overs.
When I am in downtime PHX I will make a point to stop here again."}
{"text":"$9 a pint. There are no prices on the beer list. No big deal until they bring you your tab and they want $9 a pint. What beer is worth $9 a pint ? None at this place. Garbage!"}
{"text":"We met our friends Rachel and Mark here.   We had drinks and some appetizers, the food came out quick, the service was great.   My favorite was the Jalapeno Pork Sliders.  The atmosphere was full of energy...We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great sports bar to go to just outside of Chase Field.
I was strolling along beautiful downtown Phoenix and asked an officer for a decent place to eat and one of his choices was this place.  Most of the people walking around were headed to watch the Suns game at U.S. Airways arena so this place wasn't crowded.
My waiter Ray recommended the Turkey Club and it was fantastic. I almost couldn't get enough of it. Came with a side salad.
Lots of TV's and a great place to be.  Also right in front of the light rail train system, which took me directly back to my hotel.  
Perfect location, great food and great service."}
{"text":"I was here last Wednesday before a baseball game. I do not go downtown very often so I wanted to go somewhere with good food and beer prices. When my boyfriend and I arrived, we were happily greeted by many employees. It was very welcoming.

It seemed to be busy but that did not stop our waiter from bringing everything out super quick. We quickly got our beers minutes after we ordered. We were told our food would not be out for about 20-25 minutes, which was not a problem. 10 minutes later, our food was ready. It was absolutely delicious! Great portions and the burgers were fantastic. I will definitely be coming here again the next time I am in that area!"}
{"text":"First time here, the burgers are huge but not as good as they look. The Fries are okay. There's tvs along the walls so good place to watch the game and have a drink. I'm not sure if I would eat here again, to many good choices to eat in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere! Little pricey but what do you expect,  right by the stadium.  The mozzarella sticks were amazing, spring roll full of mozzarella cheese. Food was absolutely amazing...and for a busy day on game day, service was on on point. Will be returning.  Go dbacks!"}
{"text":"Worst Philly Cheese Steak in town. Very dry and small sandwich. They forgot the cheese sauce which could of helped with the dry meat. The gentleman sitting across from me had ingredients missing out of his salad. Just about the entire group had something wrong with their food. Had to find our own silverware. At least we didn't go thirsty. Only up side to this experience."}
{"text":"Nice local beer selection, and the food is really good. I especially recommend the nachos.

The service was a little slow (a long time between my water glass going dry and being refilled - and I never was given the chance to order a 2nd beer even though I finished the 1st before the food arrived - but I'm going to attribute that to it being a game day. If it wasn't packed, it would be a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was in a big hurry to get to Symphony Hall performance and upon sitting at the bar I asked if I could get super fast service and if it would take too long to get the dry rub chicken wings or if I should order something else and was assured that I'd get out in time and I did! Good to see some local beers on tap so swigged down something bartender brought when I asked for something dark, but in such a hurry I couldn't recall what it was, but bartender was sure correct in it being tasty. Wings had a sweet and lightly spicy barbecue flavor and were crisp yet juicy and very enjoyable. I appreciated the super quick service and honesty when I needed it and when I saw the burgers go by they looked good, so hope to return for a more leisurely visit."}
{"text":"Jenny makes the best drinks. She is quick, imaginative and intuitive. She made me a peach cobbler drink, an orange dreamsicle, and a blueberry white Russian. Will be definitely coming back because of her. Sweet as the drinks She makes."}
{"text":"Were seated and then no one came to talk to us or see if we needed anything.  15 min later still nothing, one server one bartender for the whole place.  Went to the bar and still no service.  Walked out without even them acknowledging us."}
{"text":"\"Put this Place on your List\" - Great food and even better Service.  Kevin (manager) runs his Restuarant with pride and passion. Aside from the very attentive service, their FOOD will blow you away! No bad choices on this Menu, there's something for everyone. Their food is served with a very pleasing plating presentation, you can tell their Chef's have integrity and it's obvious when you take the first BITE!!!"}
{"text":"The food was terrible. It's just your typical bar. Service was worse than the food. The one thing that stood out was the Mac n Cheese, it was pretty good for an average sports bar."}
{"text":"Great downtown Phx sports bar and grill!!  Food was fantastic as well as service!!  We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Went after a Diamondbacks game to eat. Waited 30 minutes to be seated, even though there were multiple vacant tables we could see. Ordered a beer and nachos. After waiting for the beer and nachos for over twenty minutes, I finally walked out. When I told the waitress we were leaving they offered no apology. Waitresses were standing around and chatting for the entire 20 minutes, while we waited for nachos and one beer. Horrible service. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"I've never had such a bad experience here in AZ. I was privileged to have the manager disrespect me in a way that way that I've never experienced in my life!!! I had another customer throw a plastic glass at me after slamming his drink and when I approached him he told me to move on! When it was brought to managements attention I was told to leave because I was only with a party of 2 and not 4-6 that he was with. He was in the wrong but yet I was told to leave. So sad!!! God Bless America!!! I'll never recommend this place to anyone ever!!! And yes I'm a Veteran who served our country!! This was the great management that I was dealing with!!"}
{"text":"Bacon burger is the bomb! Must come and eat at this amazing establishment!!! The staff is super friendly and ice cold beers."}
{"text":"It's our favorite weekend hang out joint before we go to the D backs games. We have so much fun people watching here and the food is delicious. Lots of draft beers. Give it a try, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Food was typical.  Nothing special. Service left a lot to be desired. They were hardly busy, so no excuses to not be quick to greet. The waitress didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken and salmon fit bowls off UBEReats, and I am currently counting calories and need to weight and measure everything I eat. I requested for them to separate all my good expecting it to be a very excessive request that they wouldn't do; but THEY DID! They seriously put everything in it's own ramekin for me! I love a restaurant that comes through for you!! 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Came to this place to experience opening day!  Not as crazy down here like it gets in Denver but finally a couple hours before the game or got packed down by the stadium.  But that said this bar was a great time!  We were going to bar hop but never left this place, Jessica and Joe were awesome bartenders!  Go here to pre game for any event downtown!"}
{"text":"One of my fav lil spots in downtown.  This corner of downtown does not get as much love as it deserves on non game/event days [TGI Fridays is across the street] But it is at those times where folks like me like to come hang out. [As you can guess I am not much for crowds.]

 It is conveniently located on the 3rd St and Jefferson lightrail stop (an eastbound station) or just few short blocks walk south from the 3rd St and Washington lightrail stop (a westbound station).   So if you are one of those like me who likes to do the occasional lightrail pub crawl with friends make sure to add this to your list.  

The booze is cold and their menu is pretty hot.  Hot in that it has some great items to choose.  My personal favorites are the nachos (those chips are awesome) add the beef or chicken and it just makes this plate of nachos much more yummy.  They make their own cheese sauce, it is not some yellow/orange glop they give you at a sporting event or movie.  Their burgers rock! Their salads woah.  But I still like their Mediterranean Hummus with the cool crisp veggies.  They have partnered with Mountainside Fitness to create a portion of the menu that is both tasty and healthy and I have to say it lives up to both.  The service has been excellent and I have never had an issue even at it's busiest."}
{"text":"We found this place while we were waiting for Chase Field to open before a DBacks game and have been coming in before each game since. The food is really good and I love the homemade nacho cheese sauce. The chicken on the nachos is really good too. They have a large selection of beers including several local selections. All of the dishes we have seen come out look really good but I haven't been able to tear myself away from that darn nacho sauce. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"I stopped by Coach's Corner during a D backs game on the 4th of July... they weren't terribly busy because the game was still going. I tried a couple of cocktails and the first one was undrinkable.... it tasted like grape cough medicine...yuck. Luckily, our friendly waitress ( the reason for the 3 stars) replaced the drink with a margarita, which was fine, but nothing special. I would like to go back and try the food, but I would maybe stick to beer next time."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVED this place!

After a game at Chase Field, we were looking for somewhere closeby to grab a drink and some tasty grub. Well, Coach's Corner is directly across the street and super convenient, so we popped in to check it out.

We were seated immediately by a nice hostess. It's a pretty big place, with plenty of seating and a large bar. They had a really good beer selection, and all of the food sounded tasty.

They didn't have any specials for the night, but they were offering tots for $5. I love me some tots, and I HIGHLY suggest ordering these if they are on the menu when you visit. They came out in a small sliver bucket and it was a HUGE serving. The tots were covered in nacho cheese, sour cream, bacon and chives. Holy crap were they amazing!

My friend ordered the chicken fingers with fries and they were surprisingly really good as well. You could tell that the fingers were made in house and not frozen from a package, and the fries seemed to be fresh cut as well.  I was pretty stuffed after a long day of eating a beer drinking, so I only ordered the Trio DIp - which was chips with salsa, guacamole and bean dip. Everything was fresh and tasty.

The prices were very reasonable, considering the location. The service was very friendly as well. I thought it would be a total tourist trap, but was pleasantly surprised. I definitely suggest stopping in before or after a game!"}
{"text":"We love stopping in here before a Dbacks game.  The menu is great. Weekday specials. Reasonable full price items. Great beer selection.  Killer burgers. And the Lobster Mac n cheese îs really good.  Get here early before baseball game or you can expect a wait for your table. The wait is not to bad."}
{"text":"Just ate lunch with a group from the convention center.  Salads and sandwiches were fresh and tasty with good portions.  Server was friendly and quick service.  Air conditioning was welcome in the heat!  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I stopped here before the Diamondback/Brewer game for a few drinks + apps, and wow does this place get jam packed! It's pretty teeny inside, and there were at least 30 of us trying to squeeze in to an already packed space. The drinks came quick (icy cold summer shandy and blue moon). There were also 2 girls giving out some kind of cider samples.. Can't remember the name but very good! We ordered chicken nachos, sliders, quesadilla, mozz sticks, and a few different burgers. I stuck with the quesadilla , fully loaded with cheese, chicken, peppers, and side of salsa. I couldn't finish it, was a lot of food. Very friendly and fast, will be back for sure before/after game days :)"}
{"text":"Visitor from out of town, looking for somewhere good to eat with co-workers and Yelp directs us to this place. It was a Sunday night, so the place was pretty empty, which didn't bother us at all. Started with the shrimp guacamole and garlic mozzarella sticks. Both were really, really good. Everyone also thought their cocktails were made really well. For a meal, I had the Baja Power Bowl which was delicious. Definitely felt a little healthier and will pretty filling. Others had the table had the wings, Buffalo Chicken mac and Fried Chicken Sliders and I heard nothing but great reviews on all of them. There is no confusion about this being a sports bar, considering its location and decor. Our server/bartender, Jenny, was very attentive and friendly. Overall, I liked this place a lot and would return if in the Phoenix area again."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because I checked this place out for the first time last night before the Suns game with my son and his friend. After being seated we basically weren't assigned a server. Waited 15 mins for a beer, finally flagged someone down. Got our beers....still no server. I finally flagged down the manager and explained the situation. He was awesome! Took our orders, assigned a server, who also couldn't have been nicer to us after discovering the mix up in assignments ...which I understand happens. What I was SUPER impressed by was how quickly they took care of us after that, excellent customer service. Top it off with some VERY yummy burgers, buying us a round of beers for our inconvenience, we ended up having a wonderful experience. I'll definitely return and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Service was great......food was above average.......a little pricey.....$3 for iced tea?"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner prior to a Rattler's game. Although we are not fans of bar food this is probably a notch above most bar food restaurants. The place was packed with people and very loud as to be expected, lots of sports memorabilia and TV's so you can keep up on what game is being played. They have a decent beer list, not a tremendous amount of craft beers but they have the most popular beers and a full bar. We choose to share the bacon burger which was good, not the best burger I've ever had but good. Bits of bacon were cooked in the burger so you get the essence of bacon flavor but you can't really see it. For an extra $3.00 we ordered the onion rings which were greasy and not worth the extra money. My husband noticed they had fried Twinkies for dessert and had to have it. Since I'm not a big Twinkie fan to me it was just okay but my husband loved it and bragged to every on how much better it was then getting it at the fair since it came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate and caramel syrup drizzled on top."}
{"text":"We are visiting from LA and this place popped up on yelp. I saw a bowl of mac n cheese and I was sold. I ordered that and my bf ordered some chicken strips. Both were completely amazing. I would definitely recommend this place... our server Nate was great, friendly, and knowledgeable of the area and recommended a few cool spots to hang out for the weekend. I will definitely return to this place when I'm back in town. Go Pirates! Thanks Nate!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Blasting classic rock while we there this afternoon.  Wings are great. Reasonable prices and friendly staff and can't beat a $5 20 oz draft!"}
{"text":"Started coming here a few months ago and really like it. It's a great place to go during the lunch hour. They have a great lunch menu and you generally get in an out pretty fast. If you go during the game, it can get really busy and service is slow. But - that's kind of expected with that many people stopping in.

Friendly staff and great beer selection. Nice outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Good food and fun employees ... 
Come here as soon as you can...
LOBSTER BISQUE!!!! THE BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Came here before flying back to Denver! Fantastic food, big portions, excellent service! Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food here is beyond delicious and the libations are extremely yummy! The service is wonderful, as all the waitstaff, especially Jenna (our favorite!) really seem to like what they do and it shows! The best place to hang before a game!! Thank you Coachs Corner!!! You have patrons for life! And thank you Jenna! You're the best!"}
{"text":"Good food but slow service. Friday lunch rush but still waiting way to long to order and check out."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by their Holy Bacon burger, because everything bacon is okay in my book. My former manager and I came here because we could never eat lunch together when we worked in the same office. She ordered the Italian beef and raved about it. I, clearly, ordered the bacon burger. It was fantastic, and seriously the bacon mayonnaise was to live for! What wasn't slathered on my burger was perfect for dipping fries. It's a condiment that would compliment any meal."}
{"text":"This wasn't where I wanted to go for happy hour before the Dbacks game but it was hot & my friends didn't wanna walk & this was close. After grabbing our own drink menu, waiting too long to place our order & again for the drinks to arrive, I was giving my crew the \"you should've listened to me!\" face. And then a manager walked over & said, \"You had to wait too long for your drinks & that shouldn't happen. I want you to have a good experience here.\" Already my mood improved because bad service is so common but having acknowledged? Wow! He comped us two delicious appetizers - nachos w/ shredded beef (the cheese sauce obviously, addictingly house-made) and chicken tenders w/ fries (loved the light, crispy batter on the chicken!) And, yeah, even my cocktail - slow though it was to get to me - was a really good drink. The manager saved our repeat business. We'll definitely try it again. The food & beverages were worth the visit & hopefully they'll smooth out the service kinks, too, to become a downtown fixture."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese, chicken tenders were yummy.  Service was great.  I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Tried there coach burger with jalapeño bacon that  was amazing. I left nothing but a small piece of bread on my plate. Service was kinda of slow but the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Incredible!!  We ate here before and after the Diamondback's game because it was so good!  Pork Sliders, nachos, chicken sandwich were all delicious!!  We are in Phoenix for a few days and we will be back!!  Plus, great happy hour specials!!"}
{"text":"As soon as I entered the place, I thought I was greeted by the hostess, but it was actually a frequent customer. lol. 

I ordered the Holy Bacon - applewood bacon crusted beef patty with a side of bacon mayo. I was expecting an over abundance of bacon, but it turned out to be nothing memorable.... well, with the exception of the \"Coach's Corner Grill\" stamped on the burger. 

Truthfully, I was looking forward to dessert. I had my eyes set on the Deep Fried Ice Cream. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I hoping. All I remember was a huge glob of whipped cream and sprinkles. Even the guy next to me looked at my sloppy mess, and questioned if I was going to run in the Rock n Roll Half Marathon the next day. lol. Totally not worth the calories, and I only ran the half. I am such a fatass. lol. jk."}
