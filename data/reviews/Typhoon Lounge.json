{"text":"The food is very good for a bar. The chicken wings are always perfect, their burgers are super tasty and the sweet potato fries hit the spot. They also have a cute selection of drinks, my favourite being the litchi martini. Amazing staff, I've never had bad service at Typhoon ever."}
{"text":"Really great burgers here!!
A very relaxed, laid back kinda place. It's in the basement so fairly dark which actually adds to the atmosphere. A great place to unwind and meet up for a couple drinks for those that aren't looking for something too fancy."}
{"text":"Hubby and I each ordered a burger (monsoon and monkland) and were very happy with the deliciousness of the meal. The burger was smaller than I was expecting (bun is about 2/3 the size of a grocery store hamburger bun), but the serving of fries is generous so we were both happily full. That being said, $15 is a bit high for a burger and fries, and there was nothing really exceptional about anything here (service, ambiance, location, etc) to warrant making this a regular noshing spot for us."}
{"text":"We're outside for the street festival here on Monkland and stopped in to try their BBQ. I have to say at $9 for a 1/4 of corn, and a spoon of slaw and potatoe salad accompanying a poorly cooked burger on a cheap ol bun is not worth it..and kind of disappointing. We also tried the turkey taco which was a bit better but a bit dry (one taco...). Also their beers were $7 for standard draft...at 12 Oz.  So nothing to see here, come back for their normal fare and normal prices, they haven't got their BBQ legs yet."}
{"text":"we enjoyed the food & overall experience, but the next day we saw on our cc statement that the waitress (Allison) doubled her tip when she put the transaction through (we had already given her a very generous tip)... SO BEWARE people, i had heard about this place before that the waitresses keep the extra change, but didn't think they would dare to do the same with credit cards... double-check your bills and count your change!
it's a shame cause the food was actually good. I would have gone back if this had not happened, but I will never go back and will not recommend this place just because of some the dishonest staff!"}
{"text":"Despite living very close I hadn't had a chance to try Typhoon until yesterday.

I had the Bullseye burger with the thai dumplings on the side.

The burger was really good. Perfect size. A wee-bit over done, so if you're picky about that make sure to order under your preference (as in, if you like it medium-well, order medium-rare).

The dumplings were good, but not as good as an authentic asian restaurant. good but overrated.

I have one note to end with, while being served I noticed the waitress seemed uncomfortable in her dress, she had her arms crossed to block her cleavage. I was wondering why she was wearing a dress that she was uncomfortable in and realized that every woman working in the restaurant was wearing the same tight dress that JUST covered the butt, was skin tight and showed a lot of cleavage. I find this quite distasteful. Its one thing to have a uniform or to ask servers to wear a certain color, it's very much another to stick women into teeny tiny dresses. If the point was to have attactive women serve their customers, here's a newsflash: women can be attractive and not have to be hanging out of their dresses and have the body language of someone who feels exposed.

If I wanted to see women in embarrassing outfits, I would eat at Hooter's.

note: my waitress was great."}
{"text":"This place is where I met my man so it has a special place in my heart.
It's a basement bar but it's ok.
Great outdoor seating during the summer, inside is on the small side.
A bit pricey but it's on Monkland so that's to be expected - the food is nothing to go for but I suppose if you're really hungry and you don't mind being overcharged for very simple food, go for it.
A nice little neighbourhood place to grab a beer and catch up."}
{"text":"Very nice classy bar/lounge in the west end of town. Excellent food menu as well and reasonably priced. Music was good but a little loud and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Bit of an identity crisis going on in this place. Is it a lounge? Sports bar? Don't know. That being said its a nice place, good service. The ambience is just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"\"I got chased by a rhinoceros, I got punched so hard at tomorrow land that my nose started bleeding everywhere on stage, I believe in leprechauns\" I'm screaming this at the top of my lungs because there's pretty much no one else in the bar except for 30+ students that just preformed a spectacular show. I  officially graduated with a bachelors degree in human relations! I got parking right in front of the bar. Finished performing the best play of my life and celebrated with my awesome classmates. I \"WOOHOO\" all I wanted and screamed playing two truths and a lie.

We got a few rounds of drinks. My first drink was the typhoon Lagoon, sweet but completely virgin didn't taste a single drop of liquor. I also tried the raspberry buzz, it was too bubbly and lacked taste. I even took a breathalyzer test and after a drink and two shots I was only at 0.01. I also ordered the volcano burger with half fries and salad. It was decent but nothing I need to come back here for. Very basic burger with hot peppers and cheese on the center, didn't have tomatoes or lettuce in the middle to add a hint of freshness. Then again it's bar food what was I expecting. 

Cocktails and sangria were about $8-9 per glass. Shots were about $40-$45 for 15 shots. Service was sweet and she was able to tend to such a big and rowdy group so good for the waitress. They played some throwbacks which I always appreciate and the ambiance is very relax but fun. Overall decent place but I will not be returning unless my classmates are there playing two truths and a lie."}
{"text":"Food is surprisingly good for a bar!  Well worth it.  When I first moved to the neighbourhood I went almost every night for dinner...casual atmosphere, nice bar.
Don't get there too late on the weekend if you are eating as it turns into more of a nightclub type hangout, which is also cool, but different than the dinner spot you think you are heading to!
It's kind of tucked away in the basement, you see it off the street, but need to look for it."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in and have a drink as well as some appetizers. I personally just finished eating when we got to Typhoon, so I didn't get a chance to try their food. 

The decor is lounge oriented and modern.  Service was excellent with very nice looking ladies that we're smiling the whole time serving drinks. 

I would recommend if your close to downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Typhoon Lounge is one of those places that has become a staple of NDG in Montreal. If you're looking for a good local bar without having to go all the way downtown, Typhoon will do. They have an interesting drink menu that isn't too highly priced and they do serve a selection of burgers and poutine that hit the spot when those late night munchies kick in. 

In the summer, their patio is usually full and you get a great view of Monkland village ambiance which I love. It's walking distance from Villa Maria Metro Station and plenty of Ubers in the area if you live a bit further away and need a ride home. 

I've been coming to Typhoon since I moved to Montreal in 2007 and have seen it change from a complete dive student bar to a cleaner, slightly more upscale place. The student ambiance is completely gone now though, not that I'm complaining."}
{"text":"Waiting 45 minutes for a burger and then being told, sorry we dont have it in our menu, would you like to order something else."}
{"text":"Monkland Burger - that's all you really need to know.
This place is a bit pricey and the service is slow, but it has an amazing atmosphere, great food and tons of drinks.
Perfect for a date, evening business meeting, or just to go with friends."}
{"text":"Used to frequent on Sundays for trivia nights but it seems that they are no more. They still have Whisky & Wings Wednesdays and have great food. I've brought a number of couchsurfers here and they always seem to enjoy themselves. Great decor."}
{"text":"I went to Typhoon Lounge a few weeks ago for my ten year high school reunion.  Now that I've dated myself, I'll get on with this ;).

The bar/lounge is deceptively large considering the apparently small footprint from the outside.  The indoor area has room for at least 20-30 people seated, and probably 50-75 people standing.  The outdoor patio is in the front, around the entrance.  The bar is pretty long, and easily accommodated a large number of our group.

I went for the Garden Wrap for a vegetarian option (I was glad they had at least one or two vegetarian options, but not a great selection).  Already overpriced at $15, I opted for the additional $3 to upgrade the fries for the sweet potato variant.  I was not impressed.  The fries were soggy and flavourless, and the wrap was just uninspiring.  It wasn't awful, I just expect a much higher calibre for the price I was paying.

One thing I found quite interesting and endearing is the plastic mesh guard in the men's room urinal.  Bear with me, I know we're in \"weird\" territory here.  It's cute because it's a hockey net!  I rather enjoyed the feeling of scoring the winning goal :P.

Overall, Typhoon Lounge is a perfectly adequate venue, but I probably won't be coming back simply because it's not really my scene, and the food was overpriced and disappointing to me.  Take my experience with a grain of salt, but your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"They've got some great staff, and you should definitely sit at Kristy bar when she's working. The burgers are always good. The Monkland is my fav! They have a great cocktail list, from raspberry mint lemonade and mojitos with pretty much any fruit you'd like. Over all a great NDG hang out!"}
{"text":"This place has some high and low points for me. The high points are lots of outdoor and indoor seating , great place to grab some drinks and sit outside in the summer and enjoy the great neighbourhood vibe of monkland ave. The drinks are pretty good , they have a lot of choice and often have specials. The prices are also reasonable for the most part. The food is not bad , it's mainly your typical bar foods like burgers , salads , sandwiches , poutine etc So nothing really bad to say about the food but nothing to write home about either, so when I do come here it's usually for drinks. While the service is usually friendly it is always very verryyyy slow. It usually takes a long time for someone to come take the order , then again to bring it out and they usually don't come check in very often to see if we want anything else , which is sort of a loss for them because without all that wait time people would be more inclined to order more drinks or food. It actually takes a long time to get the bill also. Once I waited almost 45 minutes for my bill and I reminded the waitress multiple times during that timeframe (it wasn't even a busy night), I ended up going inside right to the bar to ask them if I can please just pay my bill. and I have been told this has happened to other friends of mine as well. That being said this is still a fun place to go and does have its positives. I would definitely not discourage anyone from coming here (unless they're in a rush lol) and I will likely be going back myself at some point or another , so this 3stars isn't because I've had bad experiences here , it's more based on the very slow and sort of inattentive service that could be improved on and the fact that the the food while not bad , doesn't have anything really standout about it. so it is still a tad overpriced for my taste considering it is mainly burgers and sandwiches etc. But still won't break the bank or anything like that- it's just a matter of opinion."}
{"text":"Went to typhoon for the first time on Thursday night around 10:30 with friends. We sat on the patio outside and ordered a classic sangria pitcher to share. I was definitely not impressed by their sangria, tasted more like peach schnapps than anything else. I also ordered the burger because I hadn't eaten dinner. I had the goat cheese and avocado burger with fries (15$) and everything about it was delicious. Would definitely go back to try more food and I would recommend their burgers, but not their sangria (unless of course you secretelt like peach schnapps- in that case go for it)"}
{"text":"Great little pub away from all of the chaos of down the street. The menu holds lots of great items at a decent price. Service was fantastic. 

Get the Poutine - its delicious"}
{"text":"Bar dans un sous-sol, petits ecrans pour suivre le sport, un peu vieillot et petite restauration disponible."}
