{"text":"BEST coffee ever! My latte was AMAZING! Croissant warmed up to perfection, GREAT service, trendy decor, cozy atmosphere is just what you need in a coffee shop. I could do this everyday! ABSOLUTELY love this place!"}
{"text":"bright, friendly, and cozy little café. they've got it all! great espresso, drip coffee, homemade brunch on weekends, homemade vegan baked goods, wine, specialty coffees, brunch wraps, and empanadas. the owners live in the community and take pride in the \"haute\" experience.   free wifi, plugs everywhere, great service!"}
{"text":"They had good reviews, so I went there. It was a nice little shop and it was very creative and decorative space. It was a nice place. Small brewed coffee was $2.00 and it was small. Was it high quality? I am not sure. I was not that impressed with their coffee.  The barista who was wearing glasses looked depressed and she looked angry. I thought all barista were cheerful but not her. Their tables were very small, so you may not be comfortable with bringing your laptop."}
{"text":"Visited this little cheerful-fancy-homey coffee shop this morning on my way to work. I was greeted my a friendly lady (likely owner). Ordered an americano, she smiled and then presented it to me with care. Much better service than Ezra's Pound, I must say!   I will be back soon :)  Oh yes, and my americano was great!"}
{"text":"Montreal bagels and bright! Two things I like.   Came here on a Saturday afternoon for a little coffee and breakfast. I ordered the spiced goat cheese sandwich and my boyfriend ordered a bacon & egg breakfast sandwich. My sandwich came on lovely toasted bread and was quite filling. There was also kale, pickled onions and sweet potato- yum! But word to the wise, the breakfast sandwich is just english muffin-sized with no sides, so order up if you want to make this a true, brunch-stylez meal.   This seems like it would be quite a nice place to work for the day. It appears that nearly every seat has an outlet. Easy!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the booming Dupont strip. Delicious coffee and sandwiches, laid back vibe. Will return!"}
{"text":"This is a nice cozy cafe on this bustling with traffic corner. Since I have started to explore this area a bit I think this might become a good place to get a quick java fix.  The setup is clean and simple with neat little touches (hands under the counter to hand one's coats, bags is cool). I liked the people climbing the wall installation too as its bound to start a conversation provided one thinks its symbolic first :D  I tried a cappuccino so here is the verdict Espresso: Medium Crema: OK Milk froth: Decent Latte art: Average A decent drink for this area IMO though I have to explore a bit more. Will come back to try out their dessert offerings. Didn't appreciate that they only accept debit and cash."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast sandwiches ever. Great little coffee spot with a good selection of treats. They have a few hot breakfast items - the aforementioned sandwich had a red pepper pesto with a side of hot sauce - very tasty. The service was great and you can tell this is a regular spot for people on the neighborhood. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This cafe seemed pretty nice-- until I overheard the owner talking to a customer, both saying really offensive things about a particular marginalized/minority group. I was shocked...in this day and age, in this city, I don't expect my cappuccino to be served with a free side of hate speech. I just got up and left, and I'll be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our first day in Toronto started with pouring rain. Happy that we found this place to hide. My bf liked coffee so much that decided to buy beans for us to bring home. As I'm not a coffee drinker I tried hot chocolate and have to admit that it was perfect.  They only except cash and domestic debit cards."}
{"text":"I love Haute! The service is consistently friendly and the staff are fantastic and caring. It's a smaller cafe, but I love having a coffee shop in the neighbourhood to grab coffee from or take my laptop to, on the days I am working from home. I wish that they would be open later, for night owls like me who like to get work done in the night but I understand that it's not what most people want. Secret tip - they do \"happy hour\" after lunch, and sell discounted drip coffee.   I will miss HC when I move out of this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This is a quite and cozy place. I had ordered a cappuccino, the coffee is not amazing but it's not bad either. They do give out free samples of baked treats from time to time.  It does tend to get a little cramped in there at times, however I liked how all the seats in the house faced towards the coffee bar.  This is definetly a unique coffee shop in a vast desert of Starbucks and Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to stop by here for awhile, especially as a mid-walk break on a hot day. The cafe is quite small with forward facing seats and benches facing the counter and prep station (BUT there are plugs under the benches!).   This is definitely a 'quick stop' coffee shop that you probably won't want to bring a date, but it's perfect for a 15 minute cup of coffee and a snack. They have all the obligatory options: coffee, tea, cold beverages, cookies, scones, and make an assortment of foods like breakfast wraps and select sandwiches. Not sure about the options there yet but they do offer multiple non-dairy add-ons for drinks like coconut and almond milk. I had a very good cold brew (better than some others on the strip) and a delicious gluten free Almond Matcha cookie that the barista reheated for me.  They also serve wine at night but I haven't seen that yet, will have to come by in the early evening sometime.  The only downside I see is that literally since it's a skinny hole in the wall, it's not very accessible. Somebody in a chair or a wide set walker or with a stroller might have difficulty ordering and wouldn't have much space to sit. But that's not the cafe's fault, just the LITERAL size of the store. I imagine the staff know this and accommodate as they seem very conscientious, but it's something to note."}
{"text":"Was running errands in the neighbourhood and had an hour to kill before parking expires. Very glad to have passed by this cute little coffee shop  It's small, I can imagine might even be a bit cramped if it wasn't for mid morning on a weekday.  It has a rustic chic feel with small wooden tables and single yellow rose placed randomly on some tables.   The staff (or maybe owner?) Were very friendly and answered my amateur questions.    The Evvo cake was very yummy with a slight hint of sea salt and it really complimented the machiato.  Freely offered was lemon water and water for dogs (outside lol). Although it was not packed, many patrons came for takeouts and you could tell they were locals and knew the staff well.    Will definitely come back if I was ever in the neighborhood again"}
{"text":"Just a cute farmhouse style shop for a chill day. Coffee is good. Place is a bit small for a meeting. Good for take out or a laid back coffee."}
{"text":"The coffee is pretty good but is a little more acidic than I would prefer. Espresso on the other hand is much better and I opted for a latte. Soy milk was steamed beautifully and the rosetta was impressive. The interior is really creative and nice. Unfortunately had to give three stars for the bad customer service. I come in here at least twice a week and the morning barista is always very monotone and lacks enthusiasm and warmth. As a former barista it is important to keep the regulars feeling welcomed. Maybe work on people skills a bit more. All in all, a decent cup of morning pick me up."}
{"text":"I don't know what to do with this coffee place. It's convenient for my routine but my flat white is very inconsistent. Some times the flat white is beyond the milk ratio for a latte so I might as well ask for steamed milk. Other days my flat white is spot on. If I go back I probably have to settle for cappuccino that is most consistent. Friendly staff always."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband on Canadian Thanksgiving. One of the only spots open on the strip. I had a Montreal style bagel and being from NY I still give the bagel a thumbs up. I also had a delicious warm oatmeal raisin cookie. Very cozy in here but cute. Not for huge crowds but perfect for a quick in and out breakfast and coffee."}
{"text":"I've been to this coffeehouse once with my mother and we both had a nice time. Its centrally located, the coffee is fresh and delish and the staff were amazing. I also ordered a blueberry muffin which was terrific. Try it out if you want a quick coffee to go or sit there to do some work."}
{"text":"Came in on the Saturday morning after St. Patrick's Day. The cafe was packed full of people (the hangover fight is real amiright?), but I was served pretty quickly. Americano was delicious and they had plenty of really good looking food options (including a homemade French toast casserole ) that I'll definitely try next time I'm in."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon this place and sure glad we did! The staff was so friendly and accommodating and the food was great. Gluten free and vegan banana bread with chocolate chips was to die for! Boyfriend had espresso (he is a coffee snob and said it was very good) and the chorizo egg breakfast wrap- also very good! No complaints and would definitely return"}
{"text":"This coffee shop was a pleasant find for me. On DuPont near Davenport. Lots of coffee and tea choices plus pastries. Comfy seating. My American was excellent. Service is pleasant and fast. Nice spot for a break or chat with a friend. Not far from DuPont station."}
{"text":"My favorite cup of coffee in the city. Small spot, elegant décor and some food options."}
{"text":"The best little cafe! Friendly friendly service, beautiful bright space, wifi password for all to see, not too busy, not too quiet, two clean bathrooms, happy people. Americano served with a little caraf of steamed milk awww yea!"}
{"text":"Haute Cafe is an adorable french coffee shop. Staff are very friendly. Owner seems very nice. Service was great.   I had the egg muffin with pesto ($5). Egg had an odd texture to it. Not sure how that came about. Microwave? Baked abd then frozen? Sat in the fridge for too long? To honest, I can't put my finger on it. Just an off putting texture. Unfortunately, I really wanted to fall in love with this adorable french cafe. It really just did not high any high notes for me."}
