{"text":"The decor was very nice from the plants in the the fish bowls to the center pieces. Nonetheless, we made a reservation but still had to wait over 10min before getting our table. It was very difficult to understand the waitress because she spoke very fast.  The food was ok, I had the rebel which was beans and tomatoes, good but not extraordinary, could have made it at home. My friend ordered fries and they were cold. My friends who ordered a tempei dish said it was much too salty.  The portions were small and expensive for the size, left still a bit hungry. Overall, would not recommend, there are much better vegan restaurants such as momo sushi, Lola rosa and aux vivres."}
{"text":"We soooo wanted to love LOV.  First impressions were amazing with gorgeous decor and very courteous staff.  It ended when the food started to come.  I am of the mind that the food I'm eating has to be better or equally as good as what I can make at home.  We started with the Caesar salad.  There was nothing Caesar about this salad.  The dressing was tasteless and almost seemed watered down.  Where was the garlic?? The cheesy flavour?  Then came the Quinoa Fritters.  7/10.  My 3 year old had the Mac nCheese which is her go to at most restaurants...she had 3 bites and after I tried it for myself I understood why.  NO FLAVOR!! Nothing cheesy or creamy about it.  It could have even used salt!  My husband ordered the Hero bowl and described it as 5 separate dishes put into one bowl with no thought to flavour combinations or textures.  Vegan food is sooooo much tastier than this. There are so many opportunities here to make this menu great and we really hope the kitchen figures it out.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Glad this was one of the closest restaurants to where I was staying in Montreal! Went for brunch on a Sunday and back later in the week for lunch before heading to the airport. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The gluten free waffle was a bit heavy, but delicious. The strawberries, yogurt, and chia gel on it was perfect. The beet salad for lunch was out of this world. Extremely tasty and light but satisfying. Looking forward to going back when I visit Montreal again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere the drinks the vegetarian burger yum yum yum. The bartender Jessica was super friendly and helped me with the menu (I only know a bit of French) She recommended the burger and I said yes. They also had healthy options like a carrot and ginger soup and a LOVely sounding beet salad but I had come from walking 10 miles around the city in the snow & cold and I knew only a burger would hit the spot.  The patty had a nice crispy texture on the outside with a soft interior. It held together between bites underneath the buttery bun. The bib lettuce thinly sliced onions pickles tomatoes & cheese made the burger taste fresh and somewhat healthy. I mean it could be super healthy but it was so delicious my tastebuds were not sure. The sweet and salty LOV sauce rounded out the flavors of the burger. I ate the entire thing by myself very happily and very quickly.   My next favorite part of the night was the amazing PINK drink. Also know as the Castilian Paloma. Tantalizingly tart and slightly sweet. And so cool to look at. And so easy to drink.  This restaurant has great reviews on all the other review platforms. I was surprised to see such low reviews here. I personally recommend giving it a try. It's beautiful and fun and tasty."}
{"text":"My experience at Lov was exceptional. I walked in with no reservation as I traveled to Montreal on short notice for business. The friendly hostess greeted me with a smile and managed to squeeze me in on a bar seat near the window. The restaurant was filled but it was not overly loud. The decor was beautiful, very modern and welcoming. My French is rusty so I asked for a menu in English. Food selection on the menu was very diverse. Very good mix between imitation of non vegan meals and truly unique creations so your non vegan friends still feel comfortable and you can have have something new and exciting. I naturally got one of each, the kale mac and cheese and what was called rebel. The mac and cheese was delightful. The kale added some freshness to a very light cashew cheese sauce, very good balance. Rebel is what blew me away. It was a perfect symphony of flavors. Beans and squash added some heartiness to it, while the artichoke and tomatoes balanced it out. It was topped with some sort of crunchy substance, overall delicious. As I am writing this review, my mouth is watering from the memory."}
{"text":"Wednesday night, and the restaurant is packed. Maybe it's because of their excellent social media presence, or just because they hit all the right points, it's as simple as that. They nail it.  - The decor is what strikes you first of course. It's light, playful, refreshing; elaborate and curated but not taking itself seriously, like the food. - The food is on point. It's not a vegan restaurant that hides its preference, or a baba cool hippie from the 60's with only grain dishes. Each dish has it's own flavor and texture; inventive, satisfying, good proportions and careful presentation. May be the dessert was the disappointment (hence the lost star) as it was not up to par with the rest of the meal. Don't tell your carnivore friends it's vegan, and they will still be satisfied. - The service was nice and easy. They may be trendy and full, but they still have a smile each time they interact, and they take their time with you. You don't feel rushed and the service is friendly without being unprofessional.  A very rounded experience - the price is right, for a well delivered and executed experience. It's an experience that makes you smile and be happy, like the decor."}
{"text":"Must try for vegetarian food lovers. The cocktails were an interesting as well. Service was good and the waitress was very helpful. Not sure why some folks did not like it."}
{"text":"The decor was perfect. The food was good and innovative, but some of the flavors/textures were a tad off even for a vegan/vegetarian restaurant. The top seller, gnocchi, was too basil-y, I would add more pine nuts and real/fake cheese. The Indian chickpea pancake dish was far too dry."}
{"text":"The resto is beautiful, all white-painted brick, white tables and chairs...all space and light, very pretty. We were there for Sunday brunch. I had a complicated affair of delicious rosti topped with avocado sauce, a kind of mayo and a poached egg. It was ok, but a lot of fooling around for what it was. I like simple food, and this is not the place for that. The service was excellent and the coffee was good. My cousin had yogurt and fruit, but could the yogurt have been made of almond milk? It was wierd."}
{"text":"loved the asparagus with edamame appetizer, gnocchi of sweet potato needed something different I think, fruit salad with coconut was great as was the wine. thumbs up"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the cutest restaurants i've ever been to. I got a vegan cheeseburger and it was one of the best burgers i've had. I sat at the counter because the wait for a table was ridiculous, but i went on a saturday at lunch time so that was expected. Service was lacking a bit in the beginning, as our waitress thought we were waiting for a table, but everything was brought to us in a timely manner otherwise. The overall experience was great, and I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Very cute and fun atmosphere but Not the best food...I ordered the grilled cheese and was very shocked to discover that it was the exact thickness of perhaps a thick piece of paper or a razor blade (see video). I mean, this poor sandwich looked like it had spent a week at the bottom of some kids backpack getting smashed down by textbooks before being served to me. The flavor was good however but so tiny and thin!! And they only had gluten free bread left today so I had to pay $3 extra just to be presented with this paper-thin sandwich. I also ordered the Indian Casserole and the chickpea cakes were just not good. I overlooked that because they are just the vessel to carry the casserole, but the casserole was also not the best...not bad by any means but not enough to counteract the chickpea cakes. I feel a little jipped :("}
{"text":"It's a pretty place that's worth the detour if you're looking for a beautiful decor. The interior is bright and the swings in the back really adds a magical touch to the place. I went there in the early afternoon with a girl friend and it was pretty empty. I tried the mac 'n cheese for a snack and it was the perfect amount for me. It had a gooey texture and didn't taste like squash. I liked that they added kale but it wasn't enough to stand out. As a former vegeterian, I was excited to try it. The mac n' cheese (vegan) was good but it was lacking a bit of flavor. Overall it was good meal but I don't see the hype. Maybe by trying another item on the menu would change my review."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a better rating. The food is quite good, but the rest of the experience is just off. First of all, the don't answer their phone. Ever. They also don't respond to phone messages. Why bother even having voicemail? The first time I went, having made a reservation online, we still had to wait 30 minutes for a table. We felt rushed because the kitchen was closing and ended up cutting our evening short.   I decided to give it a second chance. I went today for lunch and lo and behold, their computer system went down just after we were seated. I should also mention that the seating process was disorganized and people who walked in after us were seated before us. We had to remind the manager we were waiting. Anyway, because the system was down, were told by our server that we could not order and would just have to wait for an undetermined amount of time. I totally understand that these things can happen but maybe have a contingency plan in place? We waited for 15 minutes and then ended up leaving.  The space is beautiful, the food is good, but the service just feels like amateur hour.   Tourists beware, there are no English menus."}
{"text":"Cute and fresh ambiance. Couldn't stop checking out the decor from the entrance to the bathrooms. Made you feel like it was summer already!  Food was refreshing, great veggie combinations. Not a fan of \"vegan replacements\" in general - but they fooled me. The cauliflower dish was so yummy! Must try!   Service was hospitable, attentive and informative.  Will go back, again and again."}
{"text":"This yummy vegetarian restaurant has wonderful artfully presented food which appeals to vegans, vegetarians and even adventurous carnivores. The decor is comfortable and welcoming with lots of plants. We especially loved the hanging chairs and gender neutral bathrooms."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and nice ambiance! The food was average with some dishes being unpleasant. We ordered a LOV and a Buddha burger and both fell apart and were so difficult to eat. The presentation was ridiculous just a cherry tomato on top, looked really cheap. A little salad or a small side on the plate would make it more appealing. The burger was dense, very heavy nothing I would expect when I'm going to a vegan place. Almost felt like there was filler in my burger, I felt \"off\" the next morning. The mac n cheese was ok but the kale in it made it have a weird aftertaste. Even the wine by the glass selection was off. Although the decor is lovely, the menu and kitchen definitely need more work. So many tasty vegan options in the area, would skip this one"}
{"text":"An extraordinary palate of taste and ambience come together in what can only be described as a sensual experience of superb wine, food and service. This new vegan restaurant is making its mark on the Montreal dining scene in way that assures it will become a star in this city of high pleasure and exquisite food. Not to be missed. If you don't experience it soon you are missing out on a delectable sensation that was truly out of the world."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday night knowing that it was fully booked but just checking to see if they could squeeze us in, and sure enough they were kind enough to give us three seats near the entrance as a sort of bar. Throughout the night multiple staff apologized for where we were sitting but it was sweet and farther away from the noise.   The service was amazing, and we were shocked to learn they had just opened 5 weeks ago as the place was absolutely packed. The waiters and also who I assume was the manager were very busy running around and kept checking to make sure everything was ok. The staff were sweet and helpful. I'm sure as it is a new place they are eager to work out any kinks.   The place is beautifully decorated, and the ambiance is that of a lively restaurant. A bit loud, but then again it was packed. The food was delicious, the gnocci was fresh tasting and warm, the entrees were rather large and interesting. The two other dishes were the roast beets and something I've forgotten the name of, but was tempeh and eggplant of some sort. Both received thumbs ups.   Affordable, delicious and a lovely atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Love the decor of the place! Also a fan of their avocado toast :) Great quality of coffee too (this location is the only one that has filter coffee, although their americano is quite good). The menu is not very wide, but they do have a few good options. I've tried the brunch menu a few times and am never disappointed. I usually like getting the pancakes. Giving this place four stars though as it is a bit \"pricey\" for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Adorable and charming spot to get your vegan fix. I had their tasty burger - which for a veggie burger had great texture and held together. All you want in a veggie burger. Their big salad bowls are solid as well."}
{"text":"Benedictine that don't include eggs or hollandaise by default. Röstis that are fried way in advance. Pear toasts that can't nail the right taste nor texture. Staff that clearly doesn't want to work there. Coffee that's WAY worse that McDonald's.   At least they have the decency to not charge crazy prices."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Great food and excellent service. Had the gnocchi. Portion looked small but was very filling."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is incredible. Just absolutely gorgeous ! Their service is excellent.   Now for the food. Yes I ate here twice in one day. They left such an impression on me. What?! I'm a tourist ;)   For brunch on Saturday I ordered the waffles and Nutella toast. All vegan!  Later I came back for dinner. I ordered the Lov burger, poutine and the onion rings.   I totally recommend this place especially if you are a vegan tourist like myself."}
{"text":"Vegan/ Vegetarian place! Go for the beautiful decor and fresh food! I had the sweet potato gnocchis which were a little bland but still satisfying! I look forward to going there again specifically to try their brunch offers."}
{"text":"L'une des places les plus Instagrammable/Pinterest de Montréal. La décoration est très belle et on comprend pourquoi les foodies aiment tant prendre des photos de ce restaurant. LOV montre que le vegan peut être fancy aussi. Le burger Lov était trop sec, je recommande de prendre autre chose. J'aime bien les autres plats et les prix sont ok. Le service était ok, mais je dirais que c'est à améliorer surtout que c'est un endroit très visité."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance - truly a gem in Old Montreal. The food is fresh, unique and hearty enough to satiate any non-vegetarian/non-vegan. I can't help but to order the Lov Burger every time as it is so, so good. Only con: desserts aren't great, and definitely \"taste vegan\" - might be off-putting if that's not something you're familiar with."}
{"text":"Been Lov 2 times. Their options are diversified and menu is updated on seasons. Food is good."}
{"text":"Très beau restaurant. Il ne restait pas de place, alors on nous a proposé les balançoires et c'était une très belle expérience.  On a suivi les suggestions du serveur et il nous a suggéré des entrées un peu trop grasses (rondelle d'oignon et croquette de quinoa). Je trouve souvent que les restaurants végétariens comblent le manque de viande par le gras. L'accompagnement de salsa ananas avec la croquette était très rafraîchissant et une bonne idée à mon avis.   Nous avons pris un gnocchi de patate douce et sarrasin avec pesto-chanvre-basilic et un steak de céleri-rave. Le gnocchi avait une bonne texture, mais la sauce était trop fort en goût pour que l'on puisse détecter le goût de la patate douce. Le plat était frais et bon, mais rien d'extraordinaire. Le steak de céleri-rave était original et nous avons ou goûter le produit, car il n'avait pas trop de sauce.   Le service était attentionné et très souriant de tous les serveurs qui sont passés à table. Le serveur a entendu qu'on fêtait un anniversaire alors il a amène une petite bougie avec notre dessert et c'était une belle attention.   J'ai demandé un vin léger rouge et il n'était plus disponible, alors on m'a proposé une autre bouteille. La suggestion n'était pas du tout semblable mais ça ne m'a pas dérangé. C'était une bouteille qui n'était pas sur leur carte. La seule chose c'est que j'ai demandé au serveur si le vin était fait de cabernet franc et il m'a juste dit que c'était un mélange de cépages qu'on ne pouvait pas savoir. Après vérification sur internet, c'était bien du cabernet franc. Je trouve ça normal pour un serveur, qui était nouveau, de ne pas connaître tout sur le vin, mais il aurait dû demander à un collègue, faire une recherche ou simplement dire qu'il ne le savait pas. Mais bon, sinon le service était impeccable."}
{"text":"The ambiance created by the lovely decor was definitely appreciated! The food was really tasty, but a little bit too salty in my taste (the banh mi burger). However, the vegan cheesecake was totally amazing!"}
{"text":"Very fairly priced vegetarian and vegan options for with a great ambiance. I tried the vegan mac n cheese and couldn't tell the difference from the real thing!"}
{"text":"Endroit magnifique, serveurs adorables, bonnes saveurs. Le burger était vraiment délicieux et les entrées (surtout la \" mayonnaise \" aux câpres) étaient vraiment top!  Je reviendrai sans hésiter, attention à bien réserver :)"}
{"text":"My friend made a reservation online for 7:30pm a few days before the date. They called to confirm everything an hour before our arrival, asking if we'd be willing to push our reservation to 8pm instead due to too many guests (strike 1). We were already on our way so we couldn't allow it.   Upon entering the restaurant, you're greeted with a slim, vertical high table enough for 10 people just inches away from the entrance. The hostess only spoke to us in french despite speaking to her in english, and she immediately directed us to the seats right by the entrance. My friends and I didn't like this so we asked for one of the open tables further down near the kitchen. She, on the other hand, argued that since it's busy, we would have to stick with the seats we were given since we made no table specifications on our reservation online (strike 2). We didn't know this seeing as it was a new restaurant and there was no indication of different seat types online. Despite this, we persisted and were eventually redirected to a new table. The hostess treated us coldly and remained tense toward us for the entirety of our night.  Since we got there at a busy hour, the drinks took 20 mins to arrive alongside our appetizers, and our food took another 40mins. We were getting anxious to try out our food only for our meals to fall short of our expectations. Even when we sat right in front of the kitchen, our food was hard and cold, and just as bland (strike 3). Only good thing out of it was the kale mac n cheese.   The decor was gorgeous but as we started to pay attention to our surroundings, we thought it was a little too try-hard on the hipster side. From the bearded and tattooed servers, to the bicycle-mounted sinks, the white open-brick walls, and organic lavender-scented soaps, the aura of pretentiousness started to get to us. That being said, you pay for the experience and the atmosphere, so I'll give them that.   All in all, our experience was a solid 3/10. We tried to like it, but the cold/overpriced meals, the rude hostess, the fussy reservation, and the general vibe of this place left us not wanting to come back. Sorry, Lov."}
{"text":"Came here on an early Friday evening to meet a friend. Make sure to reserve. Beautiful space (spacious yet intimate and romantic), good and attentive service, and great food. Pricey but worth it. Can't wait to come back and try other options from the menu."}
{"text":"C'était excellent j'ai pris le bouddha burger est la petite salade César délicieux! Le décor est l'ambiance sont vraiment génial c'est un de mes restaurants végétariens préféré!"}
{"text":"This was our first stop in Montréal and we somehow managed to unwittingly time it right to not need a reservation. The staff were excellent and gave us a meal that set the bar very high. As far as vegan places go this not only ranks tops within the city but I would say anywhere. Not only did we have the most delicious poutine that incorporated kale chips along with a gourmet version of a Big Mac (The LOV burger) but we also had a meal so delicious and healthy it left us fulfilled of our taste and health cravings. It doesn't stop there though the ambience is like no other and the cocktails are to die for. We didn't have desert because our bliss factor was already through the roof. This is a must if you are in Montréal."}
{"text":"Food is so good!! The vegan cheesecake was the best part. However i reserved over a week in advance and was sat at a communal table, which was not pleasant. Staff was ok but not that accomodating."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here, vegan grilled cheese, green salad, and an interesting cocktail to help relax on a Sunday early afternoon. The sandwich was great, really good \"cheese.\" And the cocktail was interesting, with sumac. Nice staff too, even though I can't speak French."}
{"text":"LOV - local, organic, vegetarian. Good place for someone that looking for something that's local and vegetarian. I would recommend making reservation for dinner. It tend to get busy during dinner services. Decent services at the beginning, lack of attention toward the end. It probably the restaurant is busy. The kimchi fries is a must."}
{"text":"Ridiculously delicious vegan fare. This sounds corny, but the interior design is done so well, you just feel like you're going to have a special time.   Highly recommend the cheese plate and poutine there.  Cheese plate had a feta that was uncanny and a bleu cheese that was unlike any other vegan cheese I've ever had. Similar to Miyoko's, but the flavor profiles were more complex.  The poutine was the best vegan poutine we had in Montreal, period.  Wine recommendations were spot on, and the beer selection is tops."}
{"text":"The food is excellent as is the service and the decor.  The food was delicious and full of flavour. For two people we ordered the poutine, the tempe bowl, the kale \"Caesar\"and the squash dish. The meal was superb. Portions are on the smaller side so order multiple dishes.  The server and host were extremely friendly and polite. Definitely top-notch service that's passionate about the food and genuinely friendly.  As indicated by one of the reviews in French, the vibe is very trendy and LA-style and is a nice addition to the restaurant scene in Montreal.   We ordered a class of Quebec sparkling bubbly and the portion of booze was VERY generous. The glass was filled up to the top which was much appreciated!  My only small critique was that the dessert potion was too small. We related this feedback to the server. It was more like \"cheesecake shavings\" as opposed to an actual piece of cheesecake. Would have gladly payed more for a bigger portion.  Overall, this is an excellent restaurant and I highly recommend it whether you're a vegetarian or a carnivore."}
{"text":"Nice decor but the food was not as good as expected.  I have to admit the mock cocktail was delicious.  My husband is vegan so we were a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"LOV! my experience in one word. I went on a Friday, 5 pm -reservations are a must! This place fills up fast. Walk-ins mean long wait times.  Location is prime for this place! In the heart of old port-I quickly fell in love with the decor - it was refreshing, white accent lit by candle light, baby's breath flowers, had this cool eclectic Swing chairs.   Food was pleasantly priced in the evening menu: snacks starting at 4-9$, main course-up to 18$ on average. (Note my ratings on a scale of 5 *s)  For 2- we ordered pear-parsnip toast (****), carpaccio funghi (****), kale Mac-n-cheese (***), onion rings(**), the big LOV burger (****) & the Buddha burger (***) with a side of white wine by the glass (Vin du QC- fruity notes-pleasantly enjoyable).   My favourite: pear-parsnip toast! The burgers were very filling, sides were ordered separately.  As a non- vegan, I had a great experience! Wish I could've tried the terrace! But it was raining:("}
{"text":"Everything you heard about Lov is true! Except the squirrel attacks. Our favorite place for vegan brunch!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Montreal for vacation and found this place online having vegetarian and gluten free dishes.  Everything was delicious and done with great presentation.  My wife liked her food, and she is neither vegetarian nor gluten free.  The vegan cheesecake was very convincing.  Our waitress was very friendly and upbeat."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and delicious food, though they were out of the menu item that was my first choice. Cool location in old Montreal."}
{"text":"Let's get down to it. Two long time vegan travellers visited for the first time yesterday for Saturday brunch. The decor while nice, can best be described as \"pintresty\". High ceilings and hallway-like space makes it a bit loud. I had the vegan Big LOV burger, she had the vegan Haskap Berry Grilled Cheese, and we shared a side of potatoes.   The first bite of the burger gave an immediately reaction that I had that taste before. Then I realized the name and recognized the taste as a Big Mac, pretty spot on! I cannot say that I missed that taste, but I can't say that it was bad - just wasn't \"wowed\". The taste was more from the sauce and mix of pickle/toppings than the burger. In fact, having a bite of the burger alone without the bread or anything else on it was surprisingly bland. It tasted like what it was - black beans.  The Grilled Cheese was pretty darn good though, for a grilled cheese! If you are looking for something different I would recommend that over the burger.  The potatoes were perhaps the best! It was a take on poutine with a vegan cheese sauce and a maple/sriracha syrup. There was enough syrup to dip the burger in and give it a bit more of a zip!  Service was OK/neutral. The food came out fairly quickly even though the restaurant was nearly full, but we waited a bit after we finished and ended up having to ask for our check.  I think LOV benefits most from its location near McGill. I would consider the menu to be very well done veganized college fare. Indeed most of the crowd seemed college folks either in groups or seemingly with their parents."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a few coworkers and we had a nice time.   The decor and the staff are all beautiful, as is the food. It's your standard \"fancy vegan restaurant\" story. Inventive takes on dishes, tasty food, but nothing mind blowing. It was also pretty pricey.   The experience is great, but if you're all about taste and texture, it's a bit lacking."}
{"text":"Le décor de ce restaurant est superbe: tous les coins et recoins valent la peine d'être photographiés. On se croirait à Los Angeles ou n'importe quelle autre ville \"trendy\".   À première vue, le menu pour le brunch comportait beaucoup de variété et les prix étaient raisonnables, ce qui m'a agréablement surprise puisque la principale clientèle semble être des employés du quartier financier et non des étudiants.   Cependant, lorsque nos salades sont arrivées, c'était la déception. Malgré le bol massif, les portions étaient ridiculement petites. Dans la salade de mon amie, il y avait à peine tous les légumes mentionnés dans la description. Par contre, les frites au Kimchi étaient délectables et en valaient la peine.   Le service était bien aussi. La serveuse était très attentionnée et souriante.   Bref, je donnerais probablement une deuxième chance à LOV pour essayer d'autres plats que les salades."}
{"text":"Lov is wonderful! Both in terms of the food and the atmosphere. The place is adorable, so much so that it'll make you want to have their interior designer redecorate your home.   The food is inexpensive and delicious. I love the veggie burger! My friend loves the mac and cheese, too.   My brother is a hunter (and thus, an avid meat eater) but he loves this place just as much as me and my vegan friends do.   Definitely check this place out if you're vegan and also if you aren't!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I took a chance and stopped into LOV last night in hopes that we could find a table - and sure enough, we grabbed the last one!   We were so thrilled to try their fresh cocktails (I had the tequila-cocktail, she had the gin-cocktail, both were great), and we had a REALLY hard time choosing what we wanted on the menu because everything looked so good. We ended up sharing the: quinoa fritters, mushroom carpaccio, the Rebel, the risotto, and the chocolate brownie. Everything was beautifully presented and delicious!    The staff was absolutely charming, the atmosphere felt inviting, fresh, and innovative... everything about it felt great.   FAB spot!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend from out of town. It's so fresh, Spring-like inside. Very pretty and cozy. Service is very friendly if not always fast but it was agreeable. They only have one menu that is for brunch & lunch on Saturdays, with a limited selection but still some interesting things to choose from. We tried out their non-alcholic cocktail which was delicious  ($7 each). I had their famous vegan LOV burger that came with some crudites I think. It was delicious. I was hoping to have the kimchi fries but they are not available for brunch/lunch, only for dinner. I think my friend had the lumberjack which she found delicious and filling. I on the other hand was still hungry after my burger, that would be my only issue with this restaurant. We spent $40 total for a very simple but delicious lunch yet I was still hungry. That would be my only quibble. I'd like to come back to try their dinner to see what they offer."}
{"text":"I'm in Montreal for a conference, and have gone here 4 days in a row because the food and drinks are so great (and cheaper than vegan restaurants in New York City where I currently live). The Buddha burger, chocolate croissant, kale mac n cheese, beet sandwich and fries, maple brownie, Hero bowl, Paloma drink, and green smoothie were all 5 stars! Kale Caesar salad 4 stars (they have stiff competition from the Butcher's Daughter restaurant in NYC). Bartender and servers were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Location: In the old port of Montreal. The closest subway is Square Victoria and it's a short walk from there. Street parking is available but mostly metered and it may be tough to find a spot on the weekend.   The place: It's not incredibly big, but it's spacious enough. The decor is simple but lovely and cozy. Overall, the place has a great vibe. My date called a day or two in advanced to make a reservation for 7:45pm.  The goods: We ordered a few dishes to share because we wanted to taste a variety of things. My date ordered the soup - it was a velouté containing eggplant and carrot (I think). The flavor was nice, but there was something missing. My date thought it was salt and I thought it should be a little spicier. The quinoa fritters and curry dish were both big hits - absolutely delicious! The avocado toast was nice, but it fell short on seasoning (as in, there was none). I'm still not sure how I feel about the brussel sprouts - from a flavor perspective, they were OK, but the leaves were so very crispy that they fell apart pretty quickly and it was like eating air. The gnocchi that everyone raves about were a complete miss for us. We both found the dish to be very, very dry and lacking in flavor. Between us, I think that we ate half - maybe. We ordered a bottle of Riesling and really enjoyed that. Skipped dessert.  Service: Good. Our waitress was really nice and friendly.  Price point: Everything including the wine came out to $124 tax in."}
{"text":"First of all, this restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. Secondly, the food is INCREDIBLE. My friend and I shared 4 plates (3 apps and 1 main), I got a dessert and she got a mocha latte. Everything was SO good. The prices are great too, not too expensive. I highly recommend this place to anyone, not just vegans or vegetarians."}
{"text":"I had a mediocre experience at their de la Montagne location mainly due to poor service. To add to the problem, there was one of those \"please get in touch with us to discuss your recent experience\" replies, which I responded to, but did not get a reply.  Note to management: if you reach out to a customer, you should reply to them if they take the time to get back to you.  All that to say I wanted to give this place another chance, but figured we'd try their other location in hopes of better service.  Alas no.  It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order.  The food did arrive in a reasonable amount of time but some of it (the soup, the onion rings and the quinoa fritters) were lukewarm.  We had to chase someone down for the cheque and our original server seemed surprised that we had paid and were leaving.   The decor, as others have mentioned, is lovely, and the food is quite good.  We tried the soup of the day, the quinoa fritters, beet salad, big hero and the lov burger.  Everyone liked their food except my daughter who had the big hero and said it was \"weird\".  No other details were forthcoming.  I'd probably only come back here if I was eating with a vegan or vegetarian guest, because their menu is definitely a step up of those options from most other restaurants.  The slow and indifferent service would keep me away otherwise."}
{"text":"The decor of this restaurant is beautiful. Like everyone has mentioned you really need to make a reservation to have any hope of eating here.  I am a vegetarian and my wife is a vegan so finding places where we can both eat can be troublesome.  We ordered the Kale Mac n Cheese, Urban Mushroom & the Indian Casserole. All of the dishes were flavorful and were presented well. The service was great and there really wasn't much to complain about."}
{"text":"Burger was awesome. Gnocci was alright. Most of the other food that I've had or heard of people having has just been okay. So stick to the highlights of the menu."}
{"text":"I am giving it 4 stars just because it's vegan, but it really only deserves 3 stars. The quality of the food is great, but the flavours are just a little off. We've been twice now, tried different dishes, and every time everyone at the table is slightly disappointed by the flavours. The dishes are so close to being delicious, yet so far. I will return on invite, but won't be suggesting it as a go to spot."}
{"text":"Fabulous food! The vegan mac and cheese was delicious and honestly you would never know it was vegan. Also had the avocado toast with poached egg. Nice service and they allowed us to sit at the bar chatting long after we finished our meal."}
{"text":"Walking in here is like falling in lov (love. Get it? *cricket noises*). Right... on with the review!  This place is trendy. I've seen countless Instagram pictures of their beautiful restaurant so I knew I was bound to visit at some point.   First tip: Reserve a table! The place is packed ! I went on a rainy Friday night but it was still full. We initially got seated at the bar while we waited for a table and it's so cramped there. We got changed to the high tables near the door which was better but not the best seats in the house.   We ordered the kale mac and cheese, Buddha burger, Poutine, and the onion rings.  The food is AMAZING. The mac and cheese was especially remarquable. I'm a tough judge when it comes to mac and cheese but this one is one of my favourites. I can't even describe how good it was.  The onion rings were really crispy which is my favourite kind.  The Poutine was perfectly seasoned and warm. Super delectable.   I can't comment on the burger because I only got a small bite but Adam said he got \"food sweats and that only happens when I eat good food\". If adam gets food sweats over vegan food, you know it's worth it. It makes him temporarily forget he's eating something meat free.   The service is good. Given the demand it's ok if they forget certain things (water,napkins). I think they are very friendly though. They welcome you with a smile and serve you he best they can and don't seem overworked or unhappy. They also make recommendations and give you some tidbits of information about the restaurant and the kitchen which is fun!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating there yesterday for my birthday and wow!!! I had a hard time deciding what i wanted to eat since soooo many things looked appealing and contrary to usual most of it was gluten free so the choices were plentiful. I finally decided on sharing Kale mac n cheese, stuffed mushrooms and gnocchi. It was all delicious however i would not take the mac n cheese again it was good but not spectacular. The service and atmosphere was great and i cannot wait to go back!!!  The first time a month ago was so good i decided to bring a friend to try it out again. I was tempted to have the stuffed mushroom again but resisted and tried the Quinoa Fritter which were amazing, followed by the Squash feta bowl another amazing selection and i finished it off with a divine coconut crème brûlée!!!! Amazing supper in great company, wonderful service, cannot wait to return to try something new"}
{"text":"When I was in LA, I've tried a creative gourmet vegan restaurant named Erven that blew my mind, so I was pretty bummed about coming back to Montreal. When I discovered an upscale vegetarian spot is opening in Montreal, I was beyond excited. We have a lot of decent vegetarian spots, but LOV is dubbed as the one with a creative twist.   Good: Conveniently located in the Old Port right by Square Victoria, this seems like the perfect spot for locals and tourists. The interior decor is beautiful, trendy, and totally Instagram worthy. I was excited just entering the restaurant. Lots of greenery, exposed white brick walls, and just simply gorgeous decor. As for the food, the best thing I've had here was the kale Mac & cheese. Even my boyfriend was surprise that 'it's not real cheese?'. Service was very good, the waiters were attentive and courteous.   Bad: they don't have an English menu, which was a bit surprising considering it's in such a touristy area. I understand some French, but still had to ask the waiter to explain some of the dishes. I really wanted to love this place, but I honest felt the food was mediocre and menu description sounds better than the actual meal (except that Kale Mac and cheese was 10/10). I've ordered the 'Hero', (note: the staff was accommodating when it came to my sesame allergies, big ups!) The dish came in a beautiful bowl, nice presentation, but tasted horribly bland. Few pieces of unseasoned steamed eggplants were buried in the middle. The napa cabbage was minimally flavoured and kind of soggy. The tempeh was okay. Very small portion, but that was fine because the Mac and cheese was very filling anyways. Basically, the Hero was more of a Zero.  My boyfriend ordered the Rave, which was celery root. Beautiful looking dish, however the only part that was good was the guacamole and pickled onions (I think). The grains were pretty flavourless so I didn't really enjoy it either. I think I did more of a Rant than a Rave.  We also had a brownie for dessert at the end, which was okay. The almonds were a bit over roasted and the brownie was really hard. *sigh*  The food taste like something from a culinary school, beautiful presentations, but the flavours and skills are not all there yet (except that kale Mac and Cheese).  Bottom line: I probably wouldn't go back by choice. If my girlfriends want to try it, I might give it a shot again just to order the kale Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Here are a few bites from our full experience blog review -  \"Light, airy atmosphere with lots of white and greens plus beautiful copper accents coming though all awaited us inside.\"  \"This little place is perfect for vegans, vegetarians and people with food intolerances.\"  \"With \"Je Suis in Herbivore\" written on the side of their plain white t-shirts and other messages like \"Je Vie En Une Jardine\" we appreciated this easy going, humorous, youthful vibe.\""}
{"text":"One word. Incredible. Great food and atmosphere. One of the best Vegan or Vegetarian restaurants I have ever been too, period. Lots of creative items to choose from. I hade the Mushroom Carpaccio to start - better than the real thing. Gnocchi for main course - excellent preparation and flavors.   Glutenberg gluten free IPA in a can - surprisingly satisfying. I would make it my go to beer if I could find it back in Michigan. Attention Michigan craft brewers - consider tapping into the gluten free market. (Pun intended)  I gave it 4 stars but it's really 5. I don't want to give the impression that I just give out 5 stars to everything I like. However, if I come back and have a similar experience I am sure lov can earn 5 stars  - no problem.   I look forward to eating at lov again on my next visit to beautiful Montreal!"}
{"text":"Decor: 5 stars Ambiance: trendy and upbeat.  Can be loud.  RSVP: definitely make a reservation  Service: friendly but felt very slow  (30 minutes to take our order. Another 30 minutes for appetizers to arrive).  Food choices:  Quinoa fritters Kale mac and cheese big lov burger   Speaking from the perspective of a non-vegan palate I would say I enjoyed the food and would eat it again.  My two year old loved every bite.   Would definitely hope the service improves to match the food."}
{"text":"First time trying vegan food and did not really enjoy it. The burger was quite dry in my opinion. The Poutine gravy sauce was cold, so although it was in a cast iron bowl the meal was cold. The gnocchi was just okay, the consistency of the \"pasta\" was too chewy. The decor was  incredible though!"}
{"text":"For a non vegetarian, I was pleasantly surprise how satisfying the plates were. I recommend ordering two plates per person. The lov Poutine taste amazing"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few nights ago. I had to book online almost two weeks in advance to get a reservation for a weekend evening, so I had pretty high hopes. The restaurant's decor is nice, but it's a bit over crowded. Many of the tables are almost squashed together, so you could end up eating elbow to elbow with strangers.   In terms of the food, it was.. ok. I tried the Lov burger which was tasty but not exceptional. The patty was soft and fell apart easily, but the flavour was good. I also tried the fries, which were pretty generic. The house ketchup was more like salsa - thick and chunky - and was not what I would choose to eat fries with. My friend had the buckwheat sweet potato gnocchi with pesto which was also pretty good, but not great. The gnocchi was extremely dense and heavy and the pesto was a bit overpowering, although the use of arugula added a nice bitterness to the dish. I think what irked me the most was that the portion sizes were quite small for the price. The burger, for instance, didn't come with anything, not even a side salad. All to say, if I had known, I would have ordered more appetizers.   All in all, I think Lov is fine, but nothing to write home about. For the amount I ended up spending after dinner and drinks, I didn't leave feeling very satisfied. Unless someone gives me a recommendation for a particular dish that is above average, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Nachos!! I am vegan. And these are probably the best vegan nachos I have ever eaten. The mac & cheese is also very good. Service was great."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, excellent service and most importantly, delicious food! We had the beet tartare, veggie lasagna, and truffle pasta...I will definitely be back. Oh and the wine was also excellent!"}
{"text":"Il y a les fans, pui sil y a les accrocs...Complètement accroc!  La bouffe est hallucinante. Par exemple, j'ai toujours trouvé les mac and cheese grossiers...le LOV m'a rendue une fan totale!  Le décor rustique / chic vous comblera et vous fera voyager dans un monde où la simplicité rencontre élégance.  Puis il y a le staff avec qui tu ne peux t'empêcher d'être in LOV\".  ---  You have fans and you have addicts...am completely addicted!  The food is hallucinating. For exemple, I always found mac ad cheese boring...well LOV made me a total fan.  The decor, a mix of rustic and chic will make you travel in a world where simplicity meets elegance.  And there is the staff that you simply fall in LOV with!"}
{"text":"yes, i've been in LOV! i have a girlfriend i love her very much and we eat at this restaurant because we are veganators. i like the swing set; it's playful and hard. on several occasions i have tried to penetrate the kitchen and steal the recipe book. i recommend it to my friends or family and stay self-aware."}
{"text":"I loveeeee this restaurant. Definitely a go to in Montreal.  It has great prices and delicious food.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service is great."}
{"text":"Great bartender and drinks- atrocious service. Never actually got my entree because both the kitchen couldn't handle the volume of orders and server failure. Very disappointed. I spent hours here and had very little food in my stomach to show for it. There are many great elements- they just can't seem to execute because of poor management of the dining experience. Three stars for drinks and appetizers.  On a side note, if Yelp didn't hide bad reviews by calling them \"not recommended\" I would have read those reviews and known what to expect because the not recommended reviews of this restaurant are actually spot on with my experience."}
{"text":"Le point fort de LOV est indéniablement son décor esthétique et tendance, très illuminé et végétal. La nourriture, de ce côté, était correcte, sans plus. Alors que j'y suis allée pour souper, je recommanderais plutôt l'endroit pour un lunch casual. Les portions étaient petites, et les plats principales ne venaient pas avec des accompagnements (par exemple, hamburger sans frites ni salade), ce qui pourrait laisser certains sur leur faim. Ça vaut l'expérience pour l'ambiance, mais je n'y retournerais pas une deuxième fois nécessairement."}
{"text":"Manger vegan tout en étant fancy est possible!   J'ai découvert le LOV pour mon dîner d'anniversaire jeudi dernier. Nous voulions vraiment essayer cet endroit suite aux nombreux bons commentaires.   Quelques points furent décevants, surtout au niveau de l'assaisonnement des plats. Nous en avons essayé quatre différents et il n'y en a aucun que je peux dire que j'ai complètement adoré. Le mac'n'cheese, bien que le fromage vegan ait été parfait, était beaucoup trop assaisonné à mon goût. Les croquettes de quinoa m'ont charmées, mais la sauce était un peu trop vinaigrée. Même problème pour mon grilled cheese... Et la salade césar était un peu trop salée.   Mes attentes devaient surement être trop grandes car je ne conteste en rien que la nourriture était très bonne! À aucun moment je n'ai eu l'impression de manger vegan!   L'ambiance est très accueillante, le service a été un peu long mais nous savions que nous allions arriver en plein durant l'heure du lunch (c'est toujours un peu la folie à ces heures là proche du vieux-port j'ai l'impression).   Je vous le conseille si vous voulez sortir manger avec des personnes qui ne sont pas vegan/végétariennes et n'apprécient généralement pas les restos du genre, vous allez les surprendre, mais essayez d'éviter les heures de pointe! J'adore aussi la possibilité de prendre plusieurs entrées/à-côtés ou même des petits format de certains plats pour ceux qui veulent goûter à tout car ceux-ci se partagent très bien et sont assez abordables!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal over the weekend and dined at Lov with a group of 6 - 2 of which are vegetarians and one of which heard great things about Lov, so my sister made a reservation I believe 1-2 months in advance for when our family was in town. I was looking forward to it because we were in great spirits and excited to enjoy a nice rare dinner together. Unfortunately, our reservation was pushed unbeknownst to us -- they called 45 minutes before the 6 pm reservation and with no answer, still decided to push it. Beyond that this is just an odd thing to do, there was no offer to get us drinks in the meantime or even an apology or visit from the manager when we came back to sit down. Our server was friendly, but it was clear she was way too busy and had tables across the entire restaurant so she was running around. I blame this on management because a server should never be overloaded where service is delayed to this extent. As people who do or have worked in the service industry, it was just overall a disappointing experience, extra disappointing when you're on vacation and taking guests from out of town. A glass was broken and never fully cleaned up. We waited a very long time for our check, even after requesting it. That was the only time we really spoke up to the staff (after 15-20 minutes of dirty plates in front of us), other than communicating our frustration when first arriving for our reservation, so I guess it's on us for not speaking up more, but it's just unfortunate we weren't followed up with by a manager after the delayed reservation. And the food was good, but definitely nothing to write home about. I think the onion rings and the grilled cheese were some of the stand out dishes within the group. I will say that the space is beautiful as others mentioned, the ambience and decor is appealing (which is why I'll do 2 stars and not 1 for the degree it ruined the group's mood), but I'd only recommend it to a group of 2-4, not 6, like in our case. We were seated in the front of the restaurant, which doesn't have the same atmosphere as the rest of the restaurant, and perhaps why we were generally ignored."}
{"text":"We were in town for a family vacation and stopped in Lov for brunch. Our large group of six was quickly accommodated, but we were lucky! Within 25 minutes the restaurant was bustling, full of reserved tables.   The food was delicious and priced as you would expect given the chic atmosphere. Every inch of the space is Instagram and Snapchat ready, including the food. As for flavor: you will not be disappointed. Vegan brunch? Delicious? It is possible!  Had the avocado toast with a poached egg, the berry grilled \"cheese\" (vegan), and the green juice and was totally satisfied by the modest portion, full flavors and good coffee. Even my parents were happy with the Lov Benedict and Lov Burger.  TIP: Make reservations!"}
{"text":"The food is super good and filling. Not too big not too small just perfect. The decor is super nice too. The downside? Service. It's not awful, the waiters are even polite and nice. Are they efficient though? Not at all. They sat us (we were 3) at the counter even if they has free tables so I had to ask them... the plates were droped on the table with barely a smile and no word. We had to ask multiple times for the receipt. Could be improved."}
{"text":"A vegan friend and I came to check this place out, and overall had a good experience. The place definitely gets 5/5 for decor and ambience - tall ceilings, beautiful white washed brick walls and lush potted plants tastefully placed gives the space an airy bohemian vibe. Service was good, prices were acceptable...oh, and the waiters are all tall attractive men.   In terms of the food, we shared the kimchi fries, which were fantastic, with complex flavours and a great fermented cabbage kick. However, the Chili de lupeh off the seasonal menu was quite average, and somewhat small in size. The flavour of the chili itself was fine, but so is the chili from Tim Hortons. After a surprising and innovative appetizer, this was a sad $14 disappointment.   I would certainly try this place again because I suspect there are stronger menu items. However, I will be judicious in what I order."}
{"text":"Glad I found another vegan 'upscale' restaurant in Montreal. I went with my girlfriend after seeing the picture perfect shots on instagram. The decor is truly gorgeous, bright and cozy!! We both had the LOV burgers for lunch because apparently it was suppose to taste like a big mac or exactly like a ''real'' hamburger but....it was kinda tasteless. The service is friendly but took a bit before we get our plates. I will definetly give this place another shot since its so close to my work, I want to try their poutine!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Montreal and every one was telling me to try the city's poutine. However, I'm allergic to dairy so I was so excited when my cousin showed me this vegan restaurant.  When we stepped in, the decor immediately attracted me. It has cute swing seats in the back and hanging plants at the front windows.   I ordered the almond milk cappuccino, cream cheese bagel, gnocchi, big lov burger, curry, and of course the poutine. The cappuccino was pretty good. There was nothing special to the curry. My favorite was the big lov burger and the poutine. The big lov burger is probably the best vegan burger I've ever tasted. Usually the patty gets pretty dry but this burger was very juicy. My cousin said the poutine does not taste the same as real poutine but it still tasted good! Just different.   For dessert, I ordered the blueberry cheesecake and that was amazing! Like the poutine, it doesn't taste exactly like real cheesecake but it is very good. The consistency is the same! I really enjoyed it.   I would definitely come back again if I visit Montreal! I think this restaurant is a must if you eat vegan food or want to try vegan food!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding.  Great place to go for Vegan food.   So many options on the menu.  Every dish we ordered was so delicious.  Very nice ambiance and decor."}
{"text":"An extremely aesthetic restaurant. For vegetarian food, it was surprisingly hearty. I had the eggs Benedict which was expensive but I think you pay for a great experience. I would definitely come again though to try the other items on the menu. Everything that I saw others had looked great!"}
{"text":"As a first-timer to Montreal, I was excited to go to a vegan/vegetarian restaurant outside the USA. I loved the poutine with the cheese curds. It was rich and delicious. The olive stater was good, but could use more olives in it. The mushroom entree was small but fresh. The Hero 2.0 was interesting and fun. Overall, it was a fun dining experience, with great service and wonderful decor. I recommend it to people looking for a trendy, fun, vegetarian experience."}
{"text":"I went here two nights in a row while in Montreal. It is AMAZING. Being a non-alcoholic vegan makes it often challenging to find an elegant/upscale place to go for dinner. Based on reviews only, I decided to check out Restaurant LOV to see what it was like. I had such a great experience! They have great tasting and good looking mocktails and the food is incredible. My recommendations: the asparagus special appetizer (so good!), truffle & caviar (ask for a spoon to not miss a drop of the sauce), the pok' ai' (the watermelon preparation is so unique!), the beet tartar (so so tasty!).   Wonderful food for vegans and non-vegans! I can't wait to come back to Montreal to try another dish."}
{"text":"I made reservations for late Wednesday night at this venue in the Old Port, curious about the hype and the opening of a second location downtown. The place was packed as was the terrace so you definitely need reservations! The venue itself, white wash stone walls, hanging light fixtures and tropical touches is pretty and charming. We sat at the bar which was comfortable but tight if you intend to eat many small plates at once.  Having been vegan for many years, my expectations were high! I can say that the food overall was good. The dishes are creative and refined compared to other vegan venues in Montreal. We ordered the kimchi fries, kale mac n' cheese, eggplants, and the Big LOV burger; the mac n cheese was a little dry but the rest was tasty and filling!   The wine list is mostly composed of natural wines and they offer a good selection; it took us three tries before finding a good white wine and even at that, we were not convinced. Stick to the cocktails which are light and refreshing.   The service was a little slow at first as it took a while to take our drink order but flowed better after our food order probably cause it had quieted down; the food literally came out in less than 10 minutes!!  Overall, it was a good experience but would mostly go back for a cocktail and burger if I were in this touristy area."}
{"text":"La raison pour laquelle je mets seulement \"Pas mal\" c'est parce qu'il reste quelques petites choses à améliorer.  J'ai beaucoup entendu parler de cette nouvelle place qui semble être \"the place to be\" ces derniers temps pour les végéta*iens. J'ai donc eu très envie de la tester puisqu'on m'en avait dit du bien. Déjà à mon entrée j'ai trouvé le lieu sublime avec un petit côté cosy et chaleureux qu'on a envie de photographier tant la déco est sublime.  Pour commencer nous avons commandé (nous étions 3) à partager les rondelles d'oignon et les croquettes de quinoa. C'était bon, même si j'ai trouvé que ça manquait un peu de sel, mais  pour ma part c'est un détail, ça n'a pas vraiment gâcher la dégustation. Pour la suite, j'ai commandé les gnocchi da casa. C'est là que la première erreur est arrivée, en effet, ils s'étaient trompés sur la commande et avait remplacé mes gnocchi par un burger. Cependant, l'erreur a très vite été corrigée et j'ai été servie dans de brefs délais. Je ne les ai pas trouvé extraordinaires, mais pas non plus mauvais. Disons que je n'ai juste pas été épatée par ce que je mangeais, de plus, je trouve l'assiette disproportionnée par rapport à la quantité servie.  Deuxième erreur, mon chéri avait commandé un burger (qui vient sans accompagnement et c'est assez dommage ...) et en cours de repas a demandé à avoir des frites en plus (trouvant son repas un peu plate). Elles ne sont jamais arrivées... Elles n'ont par ailleurs pas été chargées.  Pour finir, on nous propose le dessert du soir, un brownie avec coulis de framboise, que nous commandons. Même si c'était assez bon, et la décoration sympathique, la portion était petite et nous cherchons toujours le coulis de framboise. Je trouve ça dommage que premièrement il n'y ai qu'un choix de dessert et que deuxièmement la promesse n'est pas respectée.   En résumé, l'endroit est vraiment chouette et mignon, et je m'y suis sentie bien. Les serveuses sont gentilles, chaleureuses et souriantes, bien qu'elles paraissent parfois débordées. J'ai donc noté plusieurs erreurs, je pense que ça sera réajusté au fil du temps et de l'expérience. Ca ne m'empêchera pas d'y retourner pour essayer d'autres choses dans les prochaines semaines et leur laisser d'autres chances. Concernant les tarifs, ils ne sont pas exorbitants, pas plus que d'autres places en tout cas."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and really loved the experience. The food overall was cosy and tasty, really successfully doing filling, yummy, vegan comfort food.  We tried the kale mac n' cheese, the mushroom carpaccio with truffles, the onion rings, the smoked beet sandwich, and the risotto. The risotto was the only miss, bland with a gluey texture. Skip it. But everything else was amazing. It's so fun to eat indulgent food like mac n' cheese or a twist on a smoked meat sandwich and not feel sad about animals, and also not feel hungry after. I just finished the takeout container of the onion rings and the panko kept them crispy and not too crazy greasy.   There are lots of cocktails, good local beers and interesting wines on the list, we loved the one orange wine they were serving by the glass. And the service last night was charming, friendly, warm, quick, and thoughtful. Really look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Love love love this place !!!! The place is so beautiful and dreamy. The food was just incredible so fresh and so good. A must go for vegan lovers"}
{"text":"I have been there once and I am already a fan! Best you can find for vegans and vegetarians.  Visited Montreal over the weekend and decided to visit this place based on other yelp reviews and recommendations from bloggers and had one of the best bunch in Montreal. I would recommend making a reservation if you mind sitting on the communal table or at the bar, we do not mind that and sometimes enjoy sitting at the bar as we did here. It gives you an opportunity to interact with the bartenders and servers more(understand that locals might not want to do it but we enjoyed that as tourists.). the staff was really friendly and delight to talk.  The place was amazing and definitely Instagram worthy and friendly (See Pics).  Let's start with food now: Soy Milk Mocha - 5/5 Cow Milk Cappuccino -  5/5 Bénédicte LOV with eggs on top - 4.5/5 Gnocchi Di Casa with real cheese- 5/5  I will definitely go back when again in Montreal."}
{"text":"Loved the vegan food here! Unfortunately we got there between lunch and dinner, so we could only eat snacks, but we thoroughly enjoyed the snacks we had! It's a lovely space! I really, really wanted to go back for dinner, but there weren't any spots available at either location. All the food around us looked great and I think this is a must stop in Montreal if you are vegan! And especially if you are looking for a nice night out in a really pretty restaurant."}
{"text":"petits plats, gros prix, saveurs à travailler.   ça faisait longtemps que je voulais aller chez LOV, très longtemps. Comme ancienne végétarienne, je trouvais que le menu avait l'air intéressant, sans parler du décor très pinterest.   Une copine et moi sommes allées au LOV pour luncher un mercredi après-midi, vers 14h. Pas la grosse de rush, et pourtant ça a prit une dizaine de minutes avant que quelqu'un vienne nous voir pour nous amener un verre d'eau.   Le menu semblait varié et proposait plusieurs choix. Mon amie a pris la soupe du jour, tomate poivron, ainsi que le mac n cheese. La soupe était bonne et le mac n cheese correct. Le fromage de courge était intéressant, mais ça manquait terriblement de sel/d'épices. Personnellement j'y suis allé pour le plat HERO, décrit comme un bol avec du tempeh, poivron, aubergine, etc. La serveuse m'a dit que c'était une bonne grosse assiette, ce que je me suis dit vu le prix de 18$. Comme sur la photo, j'ai vite réalisé qu'il s'agissait de quelques légumes séparés sur une assiette, avec 4 morceaux de tempeh. Je suis resté sur ma faim.   Le service était gentil toutefois. Courtois, quoique un peu long vu le très peu de personnes présentes.   Le décor aussi vaut la photo. Mais pour le reste, on choisit une autre option dans cette ville qui ne manque pas de restos végés."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!! I'm not even vegetarian and I throughly enjoyed this place! The service was quick and servers are quite attentive to your meal and refjll your water whenever it was empty! The place was so aesthetically pleasing, it made me happy just being there. Def recommend you go here and take some pictures on the beautiful floating(?) chairs in the back!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a 2 month old baby in tow. I wasn't expecting this place to be as happening as it was but luckily there was space in a quieter corner with space for the stroller. The server was very nice and the service was great. I ordered the orzotto and my partner ordered the beet salad with almond feta. Eating the orzotto made me contemplate my cooking skills and why I didn't have them. It was so, so, so tasty and I would order it again. The only downfall was that the portion was pretty small. The beet salad tasted great but it was more of an arugula salad with beets in it rather than a beet salad. More beets please. Also, don't pass on the almond feta, it's really good! This place is beautifully decorated, good ambiance, great music and smiley service. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan but I play one on TV. Ok, not on TV. But as someone who just likes food full-stop, I appreciate deliciousness in all forms and Restaurant LOV delivers in spades, all dairy and meat free!  First off--holy moly is the space beautiful. It's truly stunning in there. It's bright and calming, with lovely foliage set against off-white walls. Lovely as can be!  Second--the food is quite tasty. The kombucha onion rings might have been some of the best onion rings I've ever had. They weren't heavy or overly greasy in the slightest and had a delicious crunch and flavor. The dipping sauce was a little bland but the rings were flavorful enough on their own that I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. But something extra to give it some oomph (siracha? garlic? herbs?) might really take it to the next level. I also had the LOV burger, which was also tasty. The patty was not dry in the slightest (which can happen with veggie burgers) and had great flavors/spices mixed in. It came with a vegan cheese, onion, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and a special sauce. Simple but quite good.  Service was a little on the slower side but my colleague and I were busy chatting and catching up so it was nice to not feel rushed. Although if you're in a hurry you might want to tell them up front."}
{"text":"With so much great restaurant fare in Montreal, Lov certainly does NOT deserve your dollar. The food is fine, certainly good if you have a need for vegetarian... but...  The service is atrocious. Hands down the most appalling experience I have had in 15 years. Though the reservation was made a month in advance, we were bumped by 45m upon arrival. No apology.   When seated, it took 20m to order even a drink. My main course arrived 15 minutes after the first, after I asked the waitress to check on it. When it arrived, it was clearly rushed and undercooked. One party at our table had two long black hairs in her risotto.  In order to pay, two of us had to get up to ask the waitress for the check, and it took over 30m from when we finished. We missed our show in the old port. She brought the bills, and I had to get up after we had them for ten minutes to allow us to actually pay.  In summary, the experience was atrocious. An embarrassment for Ave McGill, and they dont deserve the location. There was no apology, care, or kindness shown at all."}
{"text":"The decor inside is very chic, a great place to stop by for brunch on your way to tour around old port. Although I can't really comment on the food since I have the total opposite of a vegan diet, my friend (who loves everything vegan) loved every dish we ordered :)"}
{"text":"This place restored my faith in poutine! And the nachos were the best! Great music, good vibe. L"}
{"text":"Why does vegan have to be so expensive?  Decor with gorgeous and food was original. However, lacking in flavor.  Paying for the hype and surrounding shenanigans. There are so many other vegan places more worth mentioning like Lola Rosa!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian new resto in town. Everything in the menu sounded deliscous and what we ordered didn't upset. Definitely recommend this place... oh and the ambience is amazing too"}
{"text":"First night in Montreal.  Chose this place being it was close to our place and the reviews were positive and we were not disappointed. Best vegan meal we have had. Great atmosphere. Sat outside listening to the birds.  Food was delicious and well prepared.  Inside restaurant was gorgeous.   Prices were quite fair.  The cheesecake was the best!!  Would return.   And might tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"Usually vegan places serve premium priced dog ass...this place was different. I got kimchi fries and left certain that no other plate of french fries will ever measure up. Sorry Chickie's & Pete's, but the vegans got you on this one. Other than that, I think I was the only male in this jawn apart from one of the waiters who had a man bun."}
{"text":"Haven't tried a lot on the menu; however the avocado toast with poached egg was really good; easy to cut, nice taste, could of used a little more avocado spread. Beautiful presentation. Add the organic hot sauce they have to it. The sauce isn't hot by any means but has wonderful flavour.  The beet salad is really good, could do with a bit more beets. However very tasty none the less and a good sharing size. The lack of beets was probably due to the time we ordered the salad at. *see service comment as to why.  The service was ok. It took a bit to get our waitress to stop rushing away from us so we could order. We placed our drink orders and before I could order our enters she ran off, essentially while I was mid sentence. we ordered our entrees  and when we went to order our main courses she told us the kitchen was closed and we could order form the snack menu. She never told us the kitchen was closing and when we asked what time the kitchen closed at she said 3:00... when we asked it was 3:02!!!!!! It was a bit of an issue to have her at least ask the kitchen if they'd make our salad we wanted. She reluctantly asked and they graciously said yes. (YAAAY for awesome kitchen staff!) she gave my friend a lot of attitude about us missing the last call for the kitchen... all this could of been avoided had she just mentioned the last call for the kitchen was at 3:00.  Beside that little incident, she was pleasant but not really attentive and the restaurant wasn't overly busy so I don't see a reason for the lack of attention.  The decor of the restaurant is absolutely lovely. It's all white brick with pretty plants and it's very bright.   Would defiantly visit again; I can't wait to try more of the yummy looking food from the menu and I'm hoping the service is a bit better next time.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"first vegan meal...amazed!  I am by no means vegan and was hesitant to spend a precious dinner meal at anywhere other than a gluttonous, French restaurant while in Montreal this past weekend. My friend and I came across LOV on a walk and were drawn in by its dreamy decor. I ruled it out for an option to visit later that night because it was vegan but was convinced by my friend...best decision ever! Honestly if no one told me all the dishes were made vegan I would have never guessed. The decor, cocktails, mains and dessert were to die for - and I felt that much better afterwards knowing I had eaten something slightly better for me than I usually would. All ingredients are seasonal and local as well. The mushroom risotto and creme brulee were incredible! I will be eating more vegan food now and I hope it's as amazing as LOV."}
{"text":"I was out in Montreal in September for my cousins bachelorette. We had one vegan person with us and we were all super hungry. Thank god this was the first restaurant that popped up on Yelp. OMG! I'm not even kidding, but we were in heaven the whole time. We loved every single dish ordered and because they are at such perfect portions, we kept ordering more. My 2 favorite dishes were the LOV Benedict and the dip platter (Spoiler alert: beet hummus is involved). I don't think any plate on that menu would disappoint so do yourself a favor and head over there to try it out."}
{"text":"J'avais vraiment très hâte de tester ce nouveau restaurant. Je suis habituellement portée vers les plats végétariens et je n'ai jamais vraiment été dans un restaurant vegan, alors cela allait être une belle découverte surtout sachant qu'une amie à moi avait essayé l'établissement et avait bien aimé. Je suis allée un mercredi à l'heure du lunch, vers 13h. Disons que tout de suite on sent l'effervescence du nouveau restaurant. C'était plein et il y avait une petite file d'attente. L'endroit est magnifique, les luminaires somptueux et donnant un air très sophistiqué à l'endroit. Des couleurs vives, il y a même des balançoires dans le fond du restaurant, ce qui rend le lieu très ludique. Le menu est simple, il y a des entrées, des salades, des snacks et des plats principaux. Les tarifs sont entre 6$ et 15$ environ. J'ai pris le végé burger ''boudha'' (avec avocat) et j'ai partagé la poutine. Mon burger était pas mal, la boulette très molle, mais savoureuse. Toutefois, je n'ai pas trouvé qu'il y avait beaucoup de condiments dans le burger, juste l'avocat, ce qui me semblait être du concombre en lanières et une petite tomate. Aucun à côté. La poutine avait une sauce toute particulière, la couleur brune ne donnait pas envie, donc pour l'oeil c'est pas jolie, mais au goût la sauce est bien assaisonnée et légèrement relevée. Le plat de mon ami le ''Hero'' ne l'a pas impressionné, des legumes bouillis, la sauce de type asiatique était toutefois excellente.  En gros, les plats ne sont pas magnifiquement présentés, ce qui est décevant vu l'énergie mise pour décorer l'endroit avec goût, la décoration de l'assiette est tout aussi importante. Je n'ai pas été impressionée par les plats, au Cinko pour 5$ j'ai mangé un des meilleurs végé burger de ma vie (c'est pas vegan ok, mais il n'en demeure pas moins que c'est meilleur). Je ne sais pas comment ce restaurant pourra tenir après que l'engouement suscité par l'ouverture s'estompe... Je me vois mal y revenir régulièrement..."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal for work and stopped here for a solo dinner.  Had the 'clean eating' monthly special.  Zucchini noodles in a truffle sauce with grilled king oyster mushrooms and tapioca \"caviar\".  I think this dish could turn me vegan, if only I could recreate it! The flavours were amazing.  I added a poached egg and that took it to the next level.  Obsessed.  Finished my meal with a crème brulee, that was nearly identical to a non-vegan brulee.  Five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"The food was very good!!!! A vegetarian restaurant that really delivers on the vegetarian food. One of my friends hates vegetables didn't even notice that the food was made from only vegetables. Definitely try the poutine, which was very rich and delicious.  The restaurant is not very big and gets very crowded at dinner time and it might be hard to move around if you have a big party.  The reason I gave the restaurant three stars was because the service was very awful. The restaurant only had 3 waiters during rush hour and this was most definitely not enough because there were way too customers. We were completely ignored by our server and on the chance that he did speak to us, he was very condescending when it was apparent that we did not speak French."}
{"text":"It was my first time . The place looks amazing . Our table was at the far back . We were afraid for the service but that turned out to be the high light of the evening . The service is AMAZING!!! Now for the food . Sorry to say but very bland . Everything looked great but the flavours were just not there ."}
{"text":"LOV is a really great spot for dinner. I made reservations but needed to push back the time slightly, and they happily accommodated my request.   I arrived to the bustling, fragrant atmosphere and was greeted immediately by the friendly staff. I saw LOV on an episode of Buzzfeed's 'Worth It', and I was so excited to try. I highly recommend getting reservations as it does get quite busy.   The menu is not too large, but every dish is thoughtful and seems super tasty. Every dish here is vegetarian and some are vegan too - honestly the perfect type of restaurant for me. The decor is very nice - complete with aesthetic marble tables - though the indoor lighting is not the most ideal for food photography. They do have a patio which I would be open to trying in the future -  but it was a cooler night when I went.   It was really hard to make choices, but I finally decided on kimchi fries as an appetizer and gnocchi as my main. The wait time for food preparation is a bit longer, but the restaurant was quite busy.   The kimchi fries came out piping hot and crispy - but really what made the fries amazing was the aioli - it was made with a soy emulsion and tasted amazing. The gnocchi is also one of their most popular dishes and I have no regrets - it was satisfying as the filling wa sweet potato, yet light as it was made with a pesto sauce.   The price point was also quite reasonable! I paid $30 after tax for 2 items. The atmosphere was a bit loud as the restaurant was narrow, but honestly LOV was great. Definitely a place to try in Montreal."}
{"text":"Malgré que Montréal soit une ville reconnue pour la quantité de restaurants végétariens et vegan (plus de 60!), LOV se distingue par sa créativité et son attention aux détails. Don't get me wrong: j'adore Aux Vivres, Crudessence, La Panthère Verte et autres mais LOV apporte une touche fancy que les autres restaurants n'ont pas toujours. Tout d'abord, l'endroit est magnifique: beaucoup de places (adaptées autant pour des couples que pour des groupes), éclairage tamisé, tapisserie avec motifs qui rappellent les chandelles et fleurs disposées sur chacune des tables, etc. Jetez un coup d'il aux quelques photos disponibles: LOV est tout droit sorti d'un compte Instagram! À noter qu'il y a même un espace, au fond, où on peut se détendre dans un des fauteuils accrochés au plafond. Livres de coloriage pour adultes disponibles! Je ne peux pas encore commenter le menu du matin ni du midi mais, du moins pour le soir, les options proposées sont assez variés. On passe du burger avec galette maison jusqu'au steak de céleri-rave en passant par le risotto et autres plats avec légumes du moment. Il y en a pour tous les goûts! Les quantités servies sont correctes. Gardez toutefois en tête que les burgers ne comprennent pas d'accompagnement par défaut et que certaines entrées (comme la Kokoda avec céviché de jeune coco et chou-rave) sont un peu petites. Cela dit, les prix sont raisonnables même si, curieusement, la majorité des entrées sont au moins aussi chères (voire plus!) que les plats principaux. J'ai beaucoup apprécié que le menu mette de l'avant des ingrédients qu'on ne retrouve pas souvent ailleurs (diversité des légumes, farro, kasha, huile de truffe, etc.). Le menu complet n'est pas encore disponible sur leur site web mais est visible sur Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/LOVRestaurant/posts/716757781820582). Au passage, environ 95% du menu est vegan. Une poignée de plats sont uniquement végétariens mais des alternatives végétaliennes sont (et seront) proposées. Malheureusement, ce n'était pas encore le cas de l'assiette de fromages quand j'y suis allé. Hâte de voir ce que ça va donner éventuellement! Aussi, la carte des desserts n'est pas encore ligne mais, de ce que m'a dit un des serveurs, un partenariat avec Sophie Sucrée (un atelier qui confectionne des desserts vegan) est en cours. Au final, je suis très content de ce que LOV apporte à l'offre actuelle des restaurants végétariens et vegan à Montréal. En plus, le restaurant est facilement accessible en transport en commun (seulement du métro Square-Victoria-OACI)! Je recommande fortement."}
{"text":"Great food! The tastiest vegan meal I have ever had. Try their avocado starter, it was really good. The personnel was friendly - it was a pleasure."}
{"text":"I came here with two girlfriends on a Tuesday. The place is really cute and nicely decorated. I like the hanging chairs even though they pretty much serve no purpose.   The service was very slow and the place was not packed. I waited maybe 15 minutes for my friends to arrive and the waiter did not offer me any water and did not ask if I wanted a drink in the meantime. It took awhile to get our food and the waiter brought one cocktail at a time. Also when the waiter saw that the water jug was empty he wasn't going to fill it up! I had to ask him to do so.   I started with the Egyptian Karkade cocktail, which consisted of dark rum, saffron, hibiscus lemon and angostura bitters. It was not good. :( My friends tried my drink too and they all didn't like it either. I then had the Pina Koala mocktail and asked the waiter to put white rum in it. It resembled a pina colada and that drink was actually good. It was made up of coconut milk, pineapple, eucalyptus, kombucha and mint/chlorophyll. I then decided to stick to Beau's beer and play it safe.  We all had the poutine. The sauce is miso based. The poutine was good but I would have liked there to be more sauce. It was all at the bottom so the poutine was a dry on top and you couldn't mix it.    This place wasn't all that bad but I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Un excellent restaurant et un très bon service ! La nourriture était très goûteuse et savoureuse  Je vais y retourner à coup sûr"}
{"text":"Went for brunch two times. Same bad and slow service both times. Second time we got a smoothie bowl. It arrived melted. We also order dessert which was taking to much time to arrive. We decided to just ask for the bill and leave. Even the bill took long to arrive. If you are very hungry don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Really too overrated as restaurant, but worth paying the visit because of its beauty. I tried the Coureur des Bois, the priciest dish in the menu, but it consists 90% of potatoes, the vegan sausage is good but not wow, the other ingredients are neglectable in number. I also took the green smoothie, but seriously it's not flattering. However, I think many people are attracted by the look of the restaurant, including myself. It is really a piece of art, basket lights and suspended chairs, I can't get enough of the decor, but I wouldn't come back for the food, sadly."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant to me and I finally had some time to swing by. I arrived around 5pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. This establishment definitely gets extra points for cleanliness and atmosphere. The decor was super cute as well. Albeit being relatively empty, the restaurant seemed to be over-staffed, but perhaps they get busier later on in the evening. Regardless, I found the service to be extremely slow. On several occasions, food was waiting for up to 10-15 minutes before it was served to customers. In addition, the servers seemed to spend more time chatting with the bartender at the bar than serving the guests. At one point, the cook even came out of the kitchen and basically told them all to get it together and stop leaving food on the counter for so long before serving it. I was also a bit irritated because the table next to mine received their food 15 minutes before mine did and we had been there for some time before they even came. With all that said, my waitress was very kind and went as far as making sure I knew exactly what was vegan and gluten-free friendly.   I ordered the vegan poutine and the muse. Both were definitely subpar. The poutine was extremely salty and almost inedible, and there was way too much gravy. Portion sizes were reasonable ish, and prices are what you'd expect at this type of place. My friend and I shared a brownie from dessert. It was good, but it was from a local vegan bakery (Sophie Sucrée).   All in all, I was fairly disappointed with my visit. The only positives that came from my experience were the atmosphere and the waitress. However, I'm willing to give this establishment another try incase it was an off night."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful setting with lovely food. Service was a little slow and cold but the food was great with a few misses. Kale mac and cheese was lacking salt and umami. The vanilla cupcake screamed \"vegan recipe\". Highlights: poutine, banh mi burger, mushroom entree, cheesecake dessert. Cocktails were also wonderful."}
{"text":"Vegan gourmet restaurants are still a rare thing so it's nice to have Lov in Montreal. They certainly created a beautiful space that is very Instagram worthy. In the late afternoon they only offer smaller plates so I've only tried the Hummus Toast. The nut cheese and olive crumbs on the pink beet hummus made a really tasty and also eye-catching combination. It's nothing you couldn't easily reproduce at home though, so I wouldn't go back just to have it again. The bread didn't seem too fresh, it was a little tough, and the slice also could have been a little thicker. To treat myself, I also ordered their mocktail Pina Koala. Cute name, pretty decoration, and quite tasty. I'd like to visit again and try something from the full menu to be able to give a better judgement."}
{"text":"Oh lovely lovely lov! How much do I lov thee? Counting the ways here first:  -utterly decadent avocado/mushroom carpaccio with savory crisps. There's a hint of truffle in there as well that is not overbearing. Although we were sharing this (my friend had the mac and cheese which I tasted but didn't lov, so I pretty much kept this plate in front of me the entire time), I might have, no I definitely did, eat the entire thing! Divine!   -Smoked. Beet. Sandwich. With. Pickles. WHAT? I thought I had given up beets forever after ODing on them on a juice fast but this sandwich is utterly incredible. I took a bite, intending only to taste it, but I ended up smashing in an entire half despite myself. Glad my friend could convince me to take a bite. What I loved was the smoky flavor mixed with the tang of pickles. The beets are thinly sliced and piled on and it was a pure lov affair for me.  -crispy giant juicy onion rings. Need I say more? OK, one thing: the creamy dipping sauce could use a kick... I'm a hot sauce fanatic and don't expect others to be, but say a smoky chipotle pepper might be added to spice things up?! Fireworks might ensue?!  As I mention above, not as much lov for the mac and cheese, but I'm a weirdo who doesn't lov mac and cheese at all. Lov's is good, don't get me wrong! The crispy kale makes it interesting & at an edible level so that it's not pure starch and creaminess (not the fault of any restaurant, this is purely a texture thing that doesn't appeal to yours, truly). So while I wouldn't order it again, I absolutely recommend it for mac and cheese lovahs!   No lov for the risotto. Sadly a bit bland and without much bite to the arborio. The salt I added still didn't help, but I'm not gonna dwell on the negative and leave it at that.   I so cannot wait to return to Montréal and get back to the Lov affair. It makes my little vegan heart so happy."}
{"text":"Went out of our way to find this spot on a weekend trip in Montreal, and overall glad we made the trip out in the cold. Ambiance and service are excellent, and the menu has a lot of creative options beyond normal vegan fair.   We got the vegan poutine, and my non-vegan boyfriend said it was better than any poutine he had ever had. I also got the French onion soup, but it didn't live up to my expectations and was on the bland side. The tempeh chili he ordered was tasty and the perfect amount of food, but it was also under seasoned and could have used a little more spice. We were still a little hungry at the end of the meal, so we ordered vegan creme brûlée, which was delicious. Good wine list as well!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch a few weeks ago. Walking into this restaurant in the morning is like a breath of fresh air. The decor is beautiful and the space is bright. The service was friendly and we got great recommendations.  I love that the drinks come with your choice of milk alternative, be it soy, almond milk etc. I thought the menu choices were rather limited but I was happy with my meal choice.  I had the coureur des bois: a spicy, but flavorful brunch item.  Don't order it if you can't handle spicy food.  The smoothie bowls that my friends ordered looked beautiful, but I can't justify paying $9 for a smoothie that was poured into a bowl and then topped with a few goji berries and oatmeal. I am sure it was much healthier than what I had though. Overall I think it's a great place for vegetarians and vegans, but with so many choices in town, I will be trying out other brunch spots before returning to LOV."}
{"text":"Not the best veg in town, I will tell you that. Go for the decor, but the menu is full of gimmicky sounding items like kombucha-laced onion rings. Really? Adding trendy ingredients to everything doesn't make it good. Also strange selection."}
{"text":"Let's preface this review by saying that I've been to the de la Montagne LOV a handful of times since it opened earlier this summer and I absolutely adore it. I was in the Old Port with relatives yesterday and figured it was about time I try the original location.  I have to admit, after having consecutive excellent experiences on de la Montagne, I had high hopes for the McGill location and, I have to say, I was slightly let down. The service was only OK and the presentation seemed to be off.  My \"Big LOV\" burger was brought out much later than the rest of my party's food. The bun was soggy and the contents were lopsided and falling out. The flavour was there, I will give them that, but the presentation and soggy bun were a big disappointment. Maybe they were having an off night? Either way, a $13 burger (with no sides) should not be soggy and falling apart!  Now that the negative is out of the way, here's why you still absolutely have to try LOV (maybe just skip the \"Big LOV\" burger). I've brought a handful of omnivore friends here and they've all been amazed by how delicious their plates are. Not to mention the cheesecake! Seriously. It doesn't matter how full we are from dinner, I always order a cheesecake for the table to share just to show them how delicious cashews can be! If I didn't tell them upfront that it's vegan, they would have no idea. It's really that good.  I really love LOV -- you'll find me there often. As a strict vegetarian with a handful of food intolerances, it's rare to find a place that is accommodating *and* truly delicious. Plant-based restaurants are far too often dismissed as flavourless hippie joints and LOV is proof that vegan doesn't have to be bland or cookie cutter. Thank you, Stéphanie Audet!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Lov for dinner last night - I am a big fan of vegan food and she hasn't tried it much but is open-minded about it. The restaurant itself is beautiful and has an amazing ambiance, but unfortunately, the food is horrible!   I opted for the eggplant appetizer - there were nice flavors, but I couldn't get over the fact that it was just large, soggy, cold pieces of eggplant in a soup. My friend got the kale mac & cheese, which our waitress told us was mindblowing but really had no flavor and just tasted like plain pasta in mashed squash - definitely \"not worth the calories\", as she said.   Next, for the entree, I got the summer garden salad and my friend ordered the Caesar salad. Both were absolute letdowns! They were both just huge portions of greens with a very acidic yet flavorless dressing - the only difference between them was the small sprinkling of toppings on each. Mine had some fruit and hers had tomatoes, dry & plain croutons, grated almonds instead of parmesan, and capers which have no place in a Caesar salad!   Maybe we ordered the wrong food, but we left the restaurant with disappointment and stomach aches (from the huge acidic salads). Our meal cost us $70 - I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal, the food is top notch the decor is beautiful and the staff is amazing. Would have gotten a 5th star but it's upsetting when a vegan restaurant can only make a non vegan Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was no doubt one of the best. The ambiance and decor was very tastefully done and the staff were very friendly. However, I wish the food had more flavour. The garlic aioli for example tasted like the store bought veganaise (unflavoured version). The burger patty was very dry. The food itself was over priced."}
{"text":"Bcp d'ambiance , tres populaire , decoration verte et propre, bon service, belle presentation des assiettes et gouteux egalement. Bonne experience vegetarienne :)"}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical about vegetarian or vegan restaurants since I'm a big meat lover, but Lov's  menu items are full of hearty and delicious options that doesn't make you feel like you're eating only vegetables. The drinks were tasty, but very strong and bitter.  My friend and I ordered an appetizer and a main each and left very satisfied. My favourites were the kimchi fries and truffle zucchini spaghetti!"}
{"text":"This place really knocked my socks off. As it's been said before, the space is stunning (I'd argue the cutest restaurant I've been to in a while.) The food, by Montreal standards, was some of the best vegan fare I've had in a long time. We enjoyed the kale mac n' cheese, the nougatella tartine, and the poutine. I really hate daiya cheese so I really appreciate that these guys make all of their own plant-based cheeses. Needless to say, there wasn't a lousy plate in the lot. We also walked away only paying $14 each!  As other folks have noticed, the service is pretty slow. I'd argue though that if you're not in a rush it's worth the wait. Honestly, it's the only thing distinguishing this as a four star as opposed to a five star.  Their brunch menu starts at the end of the month and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Great vibe and lovely decor. Food was great! The avocado toast and quinoa fritters are a MUST! The Poutine was so-so since I am not vegan and I love the taste of real cheese  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Super well made and well plated food at a price.   Small but high quality wine list. Large glass of white wine is 17 dollars, small glass is 11. Personally I find this to be a bit over priced.   Would recommend les croquette de quinoa. Found the Poutine a bit salty. Was not overly impressed by the Chou fleur entrée. In general their plates are not large, so you will have to order a good amount of food.  Their desserts are constantly rotating, but we got the cheesecake and really enjoyed it!   Excellent ambiance, not overly packed, even though it seems to be challenging to get a reservation here. Relatively quick food service"}
{"text":"The most beautiful decor and environment! Every little detail is so pleasing to the eye! I came for brunch and had the lumberjack! It definitely satisfied my vegetarian meat cravings! The potatoes were so creamy and delicious! The staff was very friendly! Highly recommend!"}
