{"text":"Came here on a rainy day and it was empty except for one other table. Service was ok, some forgotten items. Food was ok, nothing special. What was most disappointing was when they tried to double charge us for some items, and seemed very devious when confronted to this mistake. Just be wary..."}
{"text":"I am very blessed that I live right across the street from this place. The service is tremendous and they really get to take the time to serve you (and refill your water/tea all the time!) the food is given in quite generous portions for such a cheap price! The only thing that stopped me from giving them a 5 star is that they don't have any original or unique rolls, or any sushi rolls that really stick out. I think that would really benefit them."}
{"text":"I finally found the time to write a review to this place after coming here numerous times.  I mostly come here during lunch time on work days.  I have ordered their Special Box, Curry Chicken Donburi, Ramen and Sushi Combos.  I like their sushi the best.  Their portions are generous and I actually prefer this place over the other sushi restaurant in the area.  One refreshing thing about his place is that they provide green tea for free, just like in Japan!   Staff is friendly and tries to look after its customers.  It is a small restaurant with a couple of staff so sometimes they are overwhelmed if a large crowd shows up and food ends up coming out not as fast.  The last time I was there, the fascia of the building was undergoing renovation.  I look forward to what the dated strip mall will look like once renovation is finished."}
