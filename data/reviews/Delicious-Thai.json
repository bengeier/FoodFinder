{"text":"I have eaten many times at delicious Thai. That I had to learn how to make curries myself to my own spice ness level. I don't agree with Mike A.  I eat curry four to five times a day for a few years now for lunch or dinner alternating between different pastes, and I'm lean. I think coconut milk and Thai food In general is very healthy. I'd eat everyday at delicious Thai if I could afford it. I really loved all the dishes I tried."}
{"text":"Never again. The food was two hours late. The chicken and shrimp dishes were reversed. The food overall was super average. It's a shame because I had previously enjoyed Delicious Thai. Oh well, certainly not the only Thai in Calgary."}
{"text":"It was late on a Sunday night and almost every other restaurant I had tried was closed. I just happened upon Delicious-Thai tucked away in a pedestrian cul-de-sac off of 10th street. I checked their posted menu out, checked the taped up local newspaper reviews and thought \"this is going to be good!\". But it wasn't.   I was greeted with a bow by a fellow dressed in an impressive cream coloured waiter's uniform. I really liked the ambiance - the chair backs had neat covers with a big bows facing out. It was a cozy place and very neat.    I ordered the seafood satay soup which the menu promised had a variety of seafood. There was a variety but mostly it was squid. It was also very over done. Almost everything was rubbery. I also thought the portion was quite small given the price of $10+.  I almost feel bad giving a bad review since the newspaper reviews were glowing and there are several very positive google reviews as well. It is quite possible I caught the assistant chef just as he was closing up after a long day - perhaps I didn't get the best this place has to offer."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here through justeat.ca and it was a breeze. In my humble opinion it does not hold up to my all time favorite Thai restraunt but was pleasant and experience and I will eat here again in time.  The food was FAST and I mean less than 20 minutes from order to my front door, I was very nearly caught with my pants down.   My consisted of Coconut sticky rice, Red Duck Curry and Yellow chicken Curry. The rice was rice nothing special, the Duck curry was fairly tasty but lacking in the most important ingredient - The Duck. I was overwhlmed and disapointed by the excess of duck fat, skin and grisle; there was a distinct lack of actual meat. I realize duck is fatty beyond compare but it was deeply unsatisfying. The Yellow curry was a spectacular dish wich I greedily consumed with gusto, the spice was right and the sauce blew me away .  My GF ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and despite touching her upper limit for heat was delicious.  Better than most - Look elsewhere for good duck."}
{"text":"Went for dinner here for the first time tonight. No complaints. Service was excellent. Fairly busy but food came out quickly. A friend and I split the pineapple curry and chicken pad thai. It was delicious. I am quite picky when it comes to thai food. This is definitely one of my favorites. I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"just average -- thai food should really zing .... lots of flavourful ingredients mean that it should have depth and freshness.  This place is far too tame, too sweet and not great.  Pad Thai - the signature dish of every thai restaurant - should be their best thing.  Here the noodles are too sticky and over done, there is the sweetness of peanut butter in there, and only a few shrimp.    Portion sizes are too small for the price and the service is middling.  I wouldn't go again"}
{"text":"Just returned from Thailand and have decided that I LOVE Thai food! Sweet, sour, salty and HOT, O My!   So needless to say, I was on the hunt for some decent, ketchup free, Thai food in Calgary.    Went in on a Tuesday night for dinner with my good friend A.  Dining room was sparsely populated but very inviting.  We went through the menu and noticed how flexible the choices were.  With any of the curries, we could pick our choice of protein (chicken, beef, pork, shrimp etc) and adjust chili levels.  We decided to go with the Chicken Panang Curry, my all time favorite, \"Pla Rad Prik\" Deep Fried Fish with Sweet Chili Sauce and coconut rice.  Mmmmm....so good, the curry was wonderful, fish fried perfectly and portion sizes were more than enough for two.  Next time I'll give the mango sticky rice a try!"}
{"text":"I took a party of 5 out to lunch here today.  In the past, dining here was a bit slow especially at lunch but they ditched their lunch specials, which has sped things up considerably. The menu is extensive and a little bit hard to follow but once you figure out what you want, you're good to go.  We ordered the dinner for 6 for $120 which amounted to 2 appetizers of spring rolls and stuffed chicken wings, 4 entrees consisting of green curry, ginger beef, cashew chicken, vegetables with tofu and pad thai. The entrees were book-ended with generous portions of coconut rice and a dessert of sticky rice with mango.    My dining partners have diverse tastes but each one was very impressed with the quality of food, flavours and presentations.  Usually someone is unhappy with something but I can honestly say that not a single person left feeling hungry of dissatisfied with the meal.  We packaged up what we didn't devour and brought it back to the office for later consumption.  The favourites were the Pad Thai, the Green Curry and the Stuffed Chicken Wings.    It does have some detractors, the dining room is small and not the most up to date but at least they have tried to put in a effort and use what they have to the best of their ability which is endearing. The servers English wasn't the best but at least she tried to socialize with us which was really good considering apart from a take out order, we were the only diners in for lunch.   This isn't a place you go to for the decor or ambiance, its strictly about the food and if you are fan of Thai and are looking for tremendous value, I'd highly recommend it.  This place and Spicy Hut on Edmonton Trail are the go to's for  Thai for me in Calgary."}
{"text":"In the word of Larry David , Pretty Pretty Pretty Good."}
{"text":"very good spicy and creamy curries, great portions, decent thai beer selection and great service. good place to visit and i will be back for more. curry, rice, a beer, and generous tip = $22 a person. not a bad meal but this place just didn't blow me away. i'll come back if i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Thai? Yes. Delicious? Hmm.. Averagely so.  Since I broke my ankle my dining mainly revolves around delivered takeout. And mostly Thai takeout at that. In the last month I've tried quite a few different Thai places - and this one is currently at the bottom of my list.  I ordered online, which provides you with the option to add in any requests and a handy estimate of when your food will arrive. I usually order through SkipTheDishes because I find their online ordering system better, and usually it's their drivers. This restaurant has it's own drivers, which means there's no GPS tracking. As requested, the driver phoned when he arrived at my apartment building (just after the latest estimated delivery time) and I went downstairs to meet him. When he was nowhere to be seen, I called him with no answer and had to stand out by the road on crutches. He picked up the phone after 5 minutes and he'd gone to the wrong address. I did get my food, but I had to wait outside for more than 10 minutes - normally not a big deal but my broken ankle wasn't happy about it, especially when I'd noted in my order that I'm on crutches.  I tried the shrimp salad rolls, chicken fried rice, a beef stirfry and the coconut rice with mango. Overall I found the food a bit average in taste - plus less veggies in the fried rice than the other Thai places and no mushrooms in my beef stirfry - but they left in the onion that I requested to have taken out. I also had a really sore stomach after eating the food. Plus the coconut rice with mango was just mango. The restaurant notes that fresh mango isn't always available, so I requested to only have the dessert if fresh mango is available. Looks like they decided this meant I only wanted half of the dessert without checking.  I contacted SkipTheDishes about the delivery and dessert issues, who in turn contacted the business. It took almost a week for them to get back to me while waiting to hear back from Delicious Thai and the restaurant refunded the dessert.   Overall.. I found the service lacking and the food quality really wasn't worth it. Especially with so many other good Thai restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most authentic Thai in the northwest Calgary, definitely in Kensington area. Service in low but this should not be a deterrent unless you're in a hurry. Good for couples and foursomes."}
{"text":"Before I went to India, I went for Thai; Delicious Thai! (pun INtended).  Delicious Thai is a small out-of-the-way place in Kensington that does a stand-up job at being, well, delicious. I was impressed that I could choose how spicy I wanted my dish, that the rice wasn't overwhelmingly large and the staff friendly.   There are Thailand paraphernalia scattered around the restaurant so you can learn about the country who's cuisine you are sampling in case your dinner partner is uninteresting or you'd like to be inspired to visit Thailand.  Paraphernalia aside, the dishes I tried were quite flavorful and well balanced; something I expect from Thai food; and overall I found Delicious Thai to be quite charming and a nice place to pop in for a decent dinner or lunch. I would eat there again!  T."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about Delicious Thai, and the meal was very good."}
{"text":"Absolut den bästa Fried Rice jag ätit i min vistelse i Calgary. Maten var väl tillagad och mycket god. Vi beställde hemkörning och var inte missnöjda. Maten skulle tagit en timme men kom på en halvtimme, väldigt bra service. De tillagade maten på önskat sätt och utan större problem.   Mycket mycket bra, prova stekta riset!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai is a welcoming restaurant located in Kensington. With decor that appeases the eyes, flavour that appeases the taste buds and prices that appease the wallet, Delicious Thai is a 'must-experience' for all you Thai food enthusiasts out there.  Carrying a delightful assortment of vegetarian dishes, curries, stir-fries, soups, appetizers, noodles, desserts (and the list goes on and on), there's no chance that you'll leave this place with an empty stomach.  Delicious Thai is...well...simply delicious! Try 'em out."}
{"text":"Food was very well made, quiet little place, was not busy at all over the lunch break. Would definitely go back again...can't complain about anything really.  Just had the pad Thai and the dragon Thai noodle meal."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Delicious Thai. Every time my friends and I want to go for a low-key dinner, and don't want to venture too far, I take them to Delicious Thai.  Here are my favourites at the restaurant: -Green curry chicken. I love love LOVE their Green curry chicken. Absolutely amazing sauce, and I love the array of vegetables in the curry. I am pretty sure I can literally eat it every single day. - Papaya and shrimp salad. So unique and flavourful and light and fresh and tasty!! - deep fried ice cream. Mmmm!!! Try it. You have to.  Their service might be a bit slow sometimes because the restaurant gets packed pretty quickly. I went yesterday on a Monday night, and every table was occupied, and there was a steady stream of people coming in the entire time I was there! Even though the service might be a bit slow, it is very courteous. Every time I have been there, I have been greeted warmly and politely.   I love this place, and recommend it to everyone. My favourite Thai restaurant in Calgary so far."}
{"text":"Sabahat tells no lies.  The green curry here equals the best I've ever had.  If coconut milk didn't have 550 calories and 250% of my daily saturated fat allowance per freaking *cup*, I really would eat this every day.  I appreciated that choosing 'medium' spicy resulted in a curry that you would get at other places by choosing 'hot'.  The pad thai is also worth mentioning, not because it was yummy but because it tasted different than ones I've had at other places.  Gooier and maybe sweeter."}
{"text":"Drove up to this place last night and decided to order the Pad Thai for take out. Oh how many times we have passed by and I said to myself, \"Self, I wonder how this place is?\" Shrimp pad thai was ordered, 3 chiles! HOT! It took 5-10 minutes and brought it home piping hot. The portion size was just OK, perhaps below average. 4 shrimp included and yes, I always count how many I get to decide the quality of the dish for the price. This pad thai obviously had peanut butter in it which is A-OK as I like a little sweetness to the dish. The noodles were thicker than normal, like fettucine. Fresh lime and peanuts added and an oddly healthy portion size of finely juliened carrot. Too much of it that took the place of where more pad thai could have been. No leftovers as I normally have with this portion size and if I ever order again I will ease up on the chiles from here - I was up most of the night with heartburn! My bad! Value OK, service good, food average!"}
{"text":"Not so delicious. My experience with this restaurant has insured that I will never eat here again.   We wanted to have a specific Thai dish and needed delivery and after looking this was what I found. When I called the man who answered barely spoke or understood English but apparently he's the only one who can take orders. It took five mins for him to get my address, phone number, name and credit card right.  On there menu it says that you can pick how spicy you want your dish. I asked the man to please make my orders mild (which everything was) and Colin's order extra spicy. I repeated extra spicy a number of times and asked specifically once if his would be extra spicy. He never at any point during my order said he could not do this. In fact he said ok. I also asked for our order without red and green bell peppers( which are sweet and not spicy in any way). I also read what the menu listed as ingredients and asked if anything else was in the dish. He told me no and i told him it was very important that it came the way it was in the menu with no extras and he promised it would. After repeating the order to him multiple times he still repeated it back wrong. Still we worked it out and got off the phone.  A short time later the food came. So I will say that the delivery time was reasonable.   The bill reflected a different price then the menu on their OWN website. We don't care that much about price but many will. Everything we ordered was at least a dollar more than on their menu. When you order a few items that can add up. Plus when the food is mediocre it's not worth the price. The food is made with cheap ingredients and popping with the cheap stuff while very sparce on the ingredients you expect to see for the price. The restaurant boasts authentic food while three out of four of the items we ordered were nothing like the authentic dishes.  We opened our dinner and it looked nothing like the authentic Thai dish I have made and we have ordered from other Thai restaurants. Plus it had cheap from frozen veggies filling the container, after we were promised no extra crap.  Colin's dinner was as mild as they come and not extra spicy.  I picked up the phone and called them right away. I told him our dinner had extra veggies and Colin's dinner was very mild. The man tells me first that we asked not to get red or green bell peppers so they added the veggies. I told him I specifically asked him not to and he agreed. He says it's the way that dish is made. I KNOW this is not true and tell him his dish is nothing like the authentic dish and plus the authentic dish does not have frozen veggies in it. Then I say plus Colin's dinner was very mild not spicy. He says that without the bell peppers it won't be spicy. To which obviously I remind him that bell peppers are sweet. Then he says that you cant get that dish in anything but mild and I am mistaken about the spice option printed in a huge square on their menu. I told him this was not good customer service and he had told me we could have extra spicy and that the dishes would not have extra ingredients.   He responds with; and this deserves it's own paragraph because it's important that people read it; \"well then don't order food from us then\". I have worked in service jobs and I would NEVER tell a customer to shop somewhere else if they are being calm and have a valid complaint. In fact I wouldn't even say it if a person were rude. I was calm and polite in making my complaint and the man was rude and offered nothing but arguments and insults.   In my reviews over the years you will see that even if a place was not so great, I want to go back and give it another chance and that I will still point out a positive. Delicious Thai is mediocre, over priced food with a rude and completely unprofessional staff. I will not be going back and I will be telling everyone I meet not to as well. It would take an apology  for me to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Team Fam came here for one last dinner and we ordered the following:  Pad Thai with Chicken Yum Neua Yang (BBQ beef salad)  Stuffed Chicken Wings Khow Pad with Scallop (Scallop Thai Fried Rice)   For a group of 3 this was a little much in having both the fried rice and Pad Thai. The Pad Thai was easily devoured though since it had a nice sour zing and the noodles absorbed the flavour well. I wish the noodles were a little chewier though.  The BBQ Beef Salad reminded me of a Chinese dish. Here the salad had a nice sour zing similar to the Pad Thai but lacked a savoury taste inside the beef that I usually like.  The Stuffed Chicken Wings came exactly as advertised. I loved the work that went into the stuffing which is a mix of meat, herb, and rice noodle. This is definitely a great appetizer to order if you are in a sharing mood.  Last but not least we had the Scallop Fried Rice. This was an okay dish with scallop I found quite dry. I find it's rare to get chewy scallops in Asian restaurants so this is a simple carb dish you can order if you want to get stuffed or otherwise likely leave with leftovers if you have a small group like we did."}
{"text":"Yikes, if I had read the prior reviews earlier, this would've been worrisome lol.  Had to make a trans-provincial order for one of our national clients, who had requested Delicious Thai.  So far, no complaints.  One of the rare restaurants in Calgary that have their own drivers, without using 3rd party ones.  bonus that they deliver for lunch too."}
{"text":"Tonight Lounge Burger was too full of football enthusiasts, and there was an hour wait at The Broken Plate in Kensington so we happened upon this cute little Tai place slightly hidden on 10th.     Delightful decor, creamy harvest walls and very simple and elegant Tai artworks.  Each table was decked out with white tablecloths and every chair had covers with bows; it was an extremely welcoming ambience.    Traditional Tai music played faintly in the background as we were seated and our orders were taken right away.  We ordered the Pineapple Curry with beef, coconut rice for 2 and the calamari as a warm up.  I also indulged in a Tai cold coffee.  The Pineapple Curry is a wonderful blend of coconut curry, beef, red and green pepper, pineapple and lemon grass.    The food took its time and I don't know what it is about this place but acoustically I could hear every other person's conversations at our table.  This was slightly annoying but the calamari came right on time to distract me from this dilemna.  The calamari was nice and crispy, not greasy, wide oval slices accompanied by a sweet and sour sauce.  The curry was a decent portion and could easily feed two persons and the coconut rice was so pungent we could smell it before it came to the table.  Even at a mild curry rating, it still had punch, but then again I love hot spicy food.  All in all a pleasant meal at $30, and nice service from an all smiling waiter with the sweetest decorum.  I am pleased with the surprising unfolding events of the whole evening and would definitely return here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we walk by every week and had never tried. Don't be fooled by the appearance. We ordered the dinner for two and everything was delicious! When you say spicy they listen! The peanut sauce for the fresh spring rolls is spot on. The shrimp stir fry and chicken curry did not disappoint. Everything came out fast and fresh, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time after a Market Collective with friends because it was convenient.  I guess I should not really judge the food too harshly as a vegan as there were only a couple things I could eat. As I wasn't extremely hungry, I settled on salad rolls, which were modified to be without meat and etc. However, I recall it costing roughly $8-10 dollars for two veggie salad rolls that were cut into pieces on a plate and was kind of unimpressed. Although, the plating was real pretty.  Also, aesthetically it kind of made me depressed in here. Not the best of lighting, and the long white tablecloths were really gross. I still remember their pseudo satin, pilling fabric with dirt all over them because they were clearly too long. This really grossed me out because obviously I am a snob."}
{"text":"We order out quite often (I've actually never been in the actual restaurant!). It's always speedy and very delicious. Their Chicken Massaman Curry is some of the best I've ever had -- and I've tried it everywhere."}
{"text":"Coming back from a trip, nothing in the fridge, my partner and I went for an early diner around 6pm on a Saturday. The place was half full, not specially good looking. We ordered a green sweet hot curry (Gaeng Kleow Wann), and a BBQ beef salad (Yum Neua Yang), with regular rice. The food came quickly and was so good! The curry was excellent, quite spicy even though I asked for it mild. The salad was very spicy, but fresh, with good beef. So we'll come again to try other delicious thai food!"}
