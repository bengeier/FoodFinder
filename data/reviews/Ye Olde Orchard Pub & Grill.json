{"text":"Went for breakfast. Cozy atmosphere, Bob Marley playing, so much potential...what a waste! 
Stale bagel, charred stale toast and charred edges on grilled cheese for my toddler. Ordered green eggs and ham (scrambled eggs with pesto) and it looked like it was shoveled up off the street, greyish in color and waaaaaay over pesto-ed!
The waitress was very friendly (even more so with the old guy that works there?), but seemed more focused on having fun with that old guy than the fact that the place is empty because customers like us are unhappy!  My untouched green eggs that I politely informed her were not to our liking (inedible to be honest!) remained on our bill. Oh well. Won't be back. Too bad"}
{"text":"Vraiment tres bon. Les nachos et le steak était parfait!! Je conseil ce resto à tout le monde même les drinks était bien préparés. La serveuse était souriante et vraiment attentive a nos besoins"}
{"text":"Weekend breakfasts are tasty. Soups tend to be good at lunch and dinner. Otherwise food is fairly mediocre. Too many TV's."}
{"text":"Have frequented the pub 10 times or so and  found it packed with locals enjoying a beer and food. The food is quite good for pub food, especially like the stews. Beer selection more than adequate and service very good. Nice addition to the West Island. Drawbacks: 1/  the bar area to stand is too small. Eight to ten people and it is packed. 2/ a couple of the higher tables  have a TV 3 inches from your face. The TV is positioned for people sitting at other tables but encroaches on the people sitting at the higher tables. TV's not positioned well. ( or do they even need this many ) Ceiling too low for TV's. 
3/ fireplace a nice touch but takes up some ciritical area of the pub. A couple of tables close thus enjoy the fire... rest of the people in the bar not able to enjoy at all."}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast on the weekends. Did you know they had breakfast here?"}
{"text":"This restaurant was very good. I had the leg of lamb, and it was delicious! The service was very good, too-the waitress gave my children cherries when they wanted mine! I recommend \"Ye Olde Orchard\" as a dinner place."}
{"text":"The closest thing to a proper pub in NDG! Awesome atmosphere in the evenings, especially during happy hour when the place fills up. It gets a bit loud but that's the beauty of it. The food is a good mix of typical pub fare and less traditional (in Canada) Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"We needed a good irish pub around here.  Excellent choice of beer on tap and great ambiance (for a pub).  Usualy pretty packed but nothing wrong wtih sipping a nice irish stout standing around the bar with friends.  Great service.  As for the food it's a 3 star for me.  Wings are great but the Sri-Lanka execution could be bettter (I love that type of food and I was not that impressed).  Fish'n Chips = 1 good & 1 bad.  I have to go again to break the tie.  Oh yeah, you can bring the kids too!"}
{"text":"Classic pub in the heart of the Monkland Village. Authentic pub atmosphere, excellent service and fine mix of traditional and contemporary pub food. One of Montreal's finest."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good (a bit overpriced but portions are generous --Sandwiches and burgers ~$13+ pp). Although yelp lists it as a full bar, it's primarily a pub so beers are the main offerings, with a small handful of cocktails and alcoholic warm drinks. No wine as far as I can tell. 

Not a place I would go to just for the cuisine but it would be a good place to have a pint and watch the game as TVs are plentiful."}
{"text":"Great pub atmosphere! A very cozy place  with good food and service. Look out for the haggis!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible! We went for  breakfast on a bright sunny winter saturday morning...worst meal that we had had in a long time. Reheated sausages, grey bacon and watery eggs..stay away! If they mess up breakfast woulnt want to try their lunch or dinner meals."}
{"text":"Ye Olde Orchard est le pub le plus proche de chez moi, je l'ai découvert facilement du coup ...

Ce n'est pas un pub branché ou le monde fais 10 km pour y allez mais il est plaisant de s'y retrouvé quand vous êtes dans le coin.

La nourriture est bonne pour un pub.

Le choix de bière est classique pour un pub (même si je trouve leur prix un peu élevé ... mais bon ça reste classique pour un pub au final ! ) 

Excellent choix de Whisky par contre !"}
{"text":"I really like this place and despite other reviews, I've had only excellent food there.   Went for lunch in late August with parents- I had a burger, it had that homemade grill feel and was perfectly medium-well as requested.  Dad had the fish and chips, which he adored and finished- it was a hefty portion.   Mom had a chicken wrap, which she found tasty and fresh and she is a picky one and wonderful cook herself.   It came with a soup beforehand, homemade cream of potato and zucchini- delicious.   Good selection of beers and an authentic pub atmosphere, being in a circa 1800s house on the lakeshore.   Looking forward to going back when the fireplace is going for a scotch or two.  Service, from a young man, was very good, not intrusive but he was always there when we needed him.   I've been to the Monkland location MANY tines, and this location has better food.   It's a perfect place for a weekend lunch, with family or friends."}
{"text":"Ye Old Orchard Pub in Pointe-Claire.....probably the worst fish and chips I have ever encountered outside of those waxed boxes of frozen nasties. It was soggy, virtually tasteless and the small taste that was detectable, was stale. My companion had a burger or what may have started out as a burger in some other time and place. It was floppy, thin and he is sure it was from frozen. 

The fries were greasy and not in a good old-fashioned fries way. 

The waiter took our order quickly but we had quite wait for the food and believe me, it was NOT worth wait. The place was not crowded so that was not excuse. 

I could not finish my meal - it was that nasty.  As a matter of fact, the mean came back to haunt me throughout the rest of the evening.  

While the waiter was a nice enough young man, replete in a kilt - the table and the menus were sticky.  We should have clued in and left when we stuck to the table. 

This was our first and last time going to the Ye Old Orchard. We are not food snobs by any means.   This ranked as one of the worst meals we've ever been served."}
{"text":"It gets pretty crowded but if you get there early enough and grab a table for you and your friends its a good time. Classic pub."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was back when it first opened. The place was packed and the waitstaff were pretty disorganized. Luckily, the food was good. I had the pork & apple pie and enjoyed it, though wouldn't call it a must-have. 

I recently went back at a less busy hour. Had the fish & chips, which were delicious. I ordered their curry dipping sauce as an extra since I'd heard it was good, and indeed it was! 

My friend and I were both happy with our food, but the service is still a bit shaky. There were periods where it felt like they were hurrying us along, and then just as easily it would seem like we'd been forgotten. Our waiter, though charming, was scattered and left my friend waiting to pay with her card until finally another waitress did it for us.  Still, the food is good and the atmosphere/clientele is thankfully not-Clyde's. If I had to change anything, I'd take down the damn TVs. I came here to socialize, not be constantly distracted by your big flat-screens."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what has happened here, but to say there has been a food quality nosedive is putting it mildly.  Used to be a great stop for pub food, bring the kids and so forth.  The last two trips have turned us off completely.  Teenage son wouldn't touch his poutine.  Fish and chips have gone from one of the better to the absolute worst imaginable.  They look, feel and taste like they are coming out of a grocery freezer section.  Just terrible and a shame because the ambiance is great.  Service not so great.  Drink orders arrived after we finished our food! Unbelievable."}
{"text":"The thing that I love the best about this place is the service. Every time I go the waiters are so very friendly. Just perfect.

The food is good, I've had the butter chicken, the chicken sandwich, a big basic breakfast and a platter of wings. All were good, but not more than that. One disappointment was the veggies that are served with some of the Indian dishes. They are clearly frozen vegetables that have been thawed. REALLY sub-par."}
{"text":"On 6/27/16, my friends and I were wandering in search of a place to eat for dinner and happened upon the pub. It was very busy when we entered, but we lucked out with an immediate table availability. Oddly enough, American football was playing on the tvs, which was strange given the soccer tournaments going on in the world. A little later, soccer began playing. I ordered fish and chips. It was very good, much like being in England. There were a variety of beers on tap, too! Our seasoned waitress (blond-haired), weathered the onslaught of patrons with a smile and grace. She was excellent! The place is small, intimate if you will, and can get noisy. It's a pub after all, not *insert name of pricey, dress-code, restaurant*, so enjoy it for what it is. I did!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a hockey game, drink a cold beer and have a quick bite. :)
TV screens all over and comfy seating makes it a fun place to hang out with friends.
I would recommend the wings, but be aware.. if you order spicy, they will be extremely spicy!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious breakfast, and a great place to watch a hockey game. It's always a comfortable fun evening at the Old Orchard Pub."}
{"text":"First thing I have to say is that service is incredible. Friendly and smiles everywhere. Food was good but not jaw - dropping (note I went there for the breakfast). The main issue is that I was seated next to the door and the door kept getting opened and it was a cold day."}
{"text":"O-O is located where the old Le Chrysanthème used to be, and it's a great spot right in the heart of the village. I was so incredibly happy to find out that the owners of O-O opened a location in St-Sauveur (about a year ago). While St. Sauveur does have its share of restaurants, your options can be limited, particularly when it comes to affordable eating (side note: many places increase their prices on weekends!). And let's face it - there were no pubs or pub-like places there until O-O opened up. 

The pub boasts a rustic and awesome decor. Very après-ski, with rich wood, huge fireplaces and a terrasse to boot. I've been a few times and each time, the wait staff has been great - super friendly and chatty. My first visit was shortly after they opened, and one of the owners stopped by our table to say hi and see how everything was going, which I thought was a nice touch. 

As far as the food goes, I like it. The menu offers many selections from a variety of starters to fish & chips to Sri Lankan curries, and of course, plenty of beer. Bonus? They do breakfast and it's pretty hearty. 

If you're going up for the day to do some skiing, definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"I know the TV show \"Cheers\" was modeled after a pub elsewhere, but if I had to describe YOOP&G, it would be the \"Cheers\" of Point-Claire.  
The surrounding village is quaint, with several shops and other dining establishments.  The river shore is within walking distance.  I think this area defines what makes Montreal/Quebec nice... in the summer time.  I have been here twice, but both times when the weather outside has made me want nothing more than to be inside having fish and chips drinking a pint.
This is as far from a touristy place as imaginable.  I think everyone knew I was \"not from here\".  Nevertheless, the service was friendly and the food was tasty.  I also had the french onion soup this past visit.  It was yummy - perfect for warming me up on a cold rainy evening.
For sports fans, there are plenty of TVs.  Note that is not particularly big inside - you can call for reservations and I would recommend it for bigger parties."}
{"text":"Good food, good vibe and great location (you can actually find parking!).  

Even though they expanded at the back, it's still a little small so if you're going on a weekend, you should try to get there early otherwise you'll be left standing. The food is quite good and not over-priced. My favorite is the fish & chips - very tasty and those homemade fries..... Mmmm HMM!  They have a small terrace as well, which is great in summer - if you can get a spot out there. Bonus? The wait staff is outfitted in kilts. Yes ladies, even the men. Whether or not they wear their kilts 'traditionally' is a whole other story ;-)

They usually have live music on Saturday nights, though if you're sitting in the corner booth or right at the front, you might find it  a little loud. 

Lastly, they serve a mean breakfast!"}
{"text":"Fun for locals but I don't personally enjoy it there.
Very expensive ($7 for a portion of sweet potato fries).
Always very crowded and loud - although NDG has very few bars, I'll find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"Nice staff. But the food isn't what it used to be. It used to be consistently good Pub food but now, it's bad. Yes bad.

I went  three times with friends in the past month and the food quality has gone down so much since the last time I was there (summer 2014). Twice out of the three times,we returned our food. 

The following is what we had the last time:
Mahi Mahi was a joke. Tiny pieces (2) of fish which were tasteless and completely dried-up.  We could taste the grill but that was it. It tasted like a piece of cardboard had been BBQ. At $18 the dish, we had higher expectations. It was horrible.

The curries which used to be so good, were awful and were returned. 

On the good note, the sweet potato fries are excellent and the onion rings are good.

The atmosphere is fun and friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place, I love the theme and decor and the fact that everyone wears kilts. The service is friendly and food comes quick. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often. Their sangria is delicious and their sautéed shrimp linguine was to die for. Next time I'm in the NDG I'll definitely try to go back."}
{"text":"Un pub plutôt familial sans étudiants bourrés Yeahhhhh !
Situé sur Monkland, ce tout petit pub qui m'a rappelé mes souvenirs d'Irlande et d'Amsterdam est vraiment très chouette.

C'est avec une bande d'amis que j'y suis allée et nous nous sommes tous entendus sur la qualité de cet endroit. 

Nous avons bus quelques bières canadiennes et partager des chicken wings qui étaient plus bonnes les unes que les autres (épicées, medium, régulières) les frites qui les accompagnaient étaient très biens aussi. Nous avons été vite servis ce qui est toujours très agréable lorsqu'on sort du travail affamé ! Les plats qui arrivaient sur les tables voisines avaient l'air très bons et m'ont donné envie de revenir les goûter. 

Les serveurs étaient très agréables et surtout rapides ! 

C'est sur j'y retourne pour la St-Patrick !!!!!"}
{"text":"Ye Olde Orchard is situated on Monkland street in NDG. For me personally, I compare this area of NDG as smaller English \"plateau Mont-Royal\"; it has some underrated restaurants and bars. Ye Olde Orchard is a cozy friendly Celtic Pub, a great place to go with friends or coworkers. 

They are currently having a \"Curry Festival\" where they serve different curry dishes. It comes with a salad. I ordered their butter chicken. If I have to be honest I would say it's decent coming from a Celtic Pub. The chicken was tender. The sauce was not too spicy. It came with rice and Naan bread which were decent but not amazing. Again, it's not an Indian restaurant so don't expect for an Indian authenticity but it adds a nice variety to their menu. The price and portion ratio is a plus. You get your money worth.

Overall this Ye Olde Orchard Pub is a great place to just \"chill\" with friends. The waiters and waitresses are friendly easy to talk to. 

Also, you might want to get there a bit before 8pm on a Monday because they have Trivia quizz. I highly suggest you to go if you have a broad knowledge about random facts. You can win prizes for your table if you win!"}
{"text":"I'm officially raising my number of stars here.  I sat at the bar last night with a friend and the service was fantastic.  Very professional, courteous and proper.  When I say proper I mean how they poured a beer, how they presented it, the language they spoke etc...some of the stuff you don'
t notice when you're at a table.

This is ranking higher on my places to hang out...plus I always appreciate it when a place take Amex!"}
{"text":"Best pub I've been too. Great beer selection and good wines. I'm visiting and the food was better than any pub in California or Nevada I've been too. This is gourmet pub food. The fries here are soooo good and fresh cut. The 6oz cheese burger was very good, tip: ask for it medium-well done. The staff was so friendly and nice. Atmosphere was fantastic here. Will be back as many times as possible before I head back to the states."}
{"text":"So disappointing. The quality has taken a nosedive overall. They shrunk the menu as well but didn't shrink their prices.  Nothing came out of the kitchen that looked appetizing, unfortunately sitting my the kitchen so got a birds eye view of it all.  The burger was ok but that patty shrunk!  It's been progressively getting stickier and it has now reached, for me, maximum suckage."}
{"text":"Excellent musician!  Slower night but drinks were good and server was awesome and friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great selection of draft beers, amazing food and a real pub feel.  Of all their locations this is their best, likely because it's the original.
Their capon wings are huge, soups are magnificent and the service is always pleasant but when super busy can be a tad slow.
The perfect place to go for a fun dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"Have you seen the Holiday? You know that cute English/LA Christmas movie with Kate Winslet, Jack Black, Cameron Diaz and Jude Law? This Irish pub is that lovely pub. Super cozy, one of those places that everyone knows your name.

Nestled a few minutes away from Villa-Maria metro and right in NDG, this place was a beacon from Montreal's chilly weather. The moment we sat down and took our jackets, tuques, scarves and mitts off I immediately felt comfortable and the pints - Newcastles, Griffin's, Guinness' came. 

I had fish and chips (yum!) and my friends had cheeseburgers and fries (yum!!). 
Wish this place was round the corner from my place... I'd be a regular.

Local tip - this Irish pub menu has Sir Lankan curries; kitchen staff are Sri Lankan and the curries were highly recommended by friend and local NDGer.

You can find them on twitter @YOOPub"}
{"text":"This is the original Ye Old Orchard and though they've opened 2 or 3 other locations  it's still held on to the original quality and mellow vibe and remained a great local NDG pub. Doesn't feel cold or commercial or dirty or dark, it sits in the clean cozy warmly lit place in the middle. Ye serves better than average pub food with better than average service, in kilts! I do love an Irish pint and some hot wings from a man in a skirt."}
{"text":"Good food and beverage although nothing particularly cheap. I don't visit regularly but we're in the back room every December 25th for post-family catch up with friends. Sad that the kitchen is never open on that night though, we might have to switch to Typhoon or something."}
{"text":"OK atmosphere, however, quite expensive.  Food is only mediocre."}
{"text":"Decent food, okay service. Went during the daytime for a snack with 4 other people. We had the fish & chips, mussels (comes with fries), meat and mushroom pie (comes with mashed potatoes or fries), chicken wings (comes with fries or veggie sticks) and fried calamari. My faves were the meat pie, the wings and fish. The waiter wasn't rude but wasn't great either. The whole staff wears kilts which is sort of cute. They have an outdoor terrace that's nice during summer. All in all it was good in the moment but not memorable."}
{"text":"Great local pub, friendly good service, lots of beers and whiskeys. Been coming here for literally 18 years, it's reliable and great in the winter or summer on the terrace. A local institution. I've not really had the food beyond nachos burgers and fries but I usually come for a pint of beer or two and not for the food. My friends used to dominate the pub trivia and one time they won an interim round of free whiskey shots but they were all driving so they made me drink most of them. :)"}
{"text":"I was there today to have a quiet breakfast only to be talking over the shouts and scream  of three men of a Golf Game. 
They where screaming and shouting so much we had to leave midway through Lunch. 
Unsatisfied I asked for the manager , I was told the manager is never there and two of the three guys where actual employees.

Crappiest experience I ever had!"}
{"text":"It was ok... not more than that. The food wasn't anything special. Apprently the poutine there is very tasty as well as the calamaris (I haven't tried them, I was told). I had the meatpie which was quite forgetable, the beef stew is apparently boring, the fish & chips were bland and the burger was just a regular burger... If I had to go back, I'd try the poutine to see what it's all about but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back"}
{"text":"Meh. Super ordinary, over priced.

Went for a brunch, got a variety of things: fish n chips, eggs benedict, etc. All super ordinary. Like we make better stuff at home.

It just felt like a waste of money, honestly. Not that the place is bad. Nice servers, cool feel, okay options. The food just isn't worth going out for, or paying for. Personally I only like eating out if I think the experience is better than what I could recreate at home. This place can't.

Maybe if we went out for beers only, it'd be different. Will see."}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly greeting and service with a smile. Nice and cosy ambience. Food is good for the most part with a varied selection. Had to deduct a star for the sandwich I got with that horrible fake rubber Turkey, hate that.

I've had a few dishes from the menu. Stews, curries, salads all good. Burgers are great. Fries are the best! I know they're just fries but I'm constantly amazed how many places get it wrong. 

Reasonably priced.

I will be returning on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This is the fourth YOOP in the Montreal area. This newest one is located in a heritage building (1850!) on the north shore of Lac Saint -Louis. 
Your standard Irish pub with pub grub................with a twist. They serve Sri Lankan food!
 It seems one of the owners is Sri Lankan and he has staffed the kitchen so. I tried the lamb curry. Big helping of curry on a bed of rice. Tomato garnish. Waitress said it was spicy.........but I would have liked it even more so. Even then the curry was tasty and went well with my two draught choices (from local craft brewer McAuslan):  St-Ambroise Pale and Griffon Blonde. Soup and salad 
Also tried the egg roll and samosa for an app. Average tasting...and, again, could have used a bit more spice.
My colleauges enjoyed the more traditional fare i.e. Beef and Stout Stew."}
{"text":"First the positives.  Nice ambience  with a fireplace and a good choice of beers on tap.
Food on the other hand could be prepared better. I had a burger that  was overcooked without an option for medium so it was very dry. My dinner companion tried the fish and chips for a second time hoping that it would not be as dry as at a previous but no such luck. The fish was not moist.
The one common attribute to both meals was an over abundance of fries.
Disappointing. The restaurant has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"This is perhaps  not the best  pub in town  but certainly  one of the most friendliest. People  are all down to earth,  staff is extremely  friendly  and most important  of all,  the beer is always  cold..."}
{"text":"Ye Olde Orchard Pub has been an NDG favourite for many years since it opened and has been serving good food and drinks on trendy Monkland Avenue perhaps better than most others currently there.  

This is a pub based on the history of Montreal traditions with the combination of the French, English, Scottish, and Irish.  This is the original location as they have expanded years ago to the Prince Arthur area and downtown Montreal.

As far as I can recall the chefs are of Sri Lankan origin so there are a lot of curry and spicy dishes available on the specials menu and the regular menu.  I'd walked in on one of my occasional visits to Montreal and 2/3 items on the menu were curry based.

Lunch for me was a cheese burger, fries, and a coke.  All was good as usual, just as I remember it.

I like places that are like home - this is one of them."}
{"text":"What more can you ask for, good pub food, well actually they offer quite a bit more than the regular pub menu.
Very good selection of beer and there's always a good crowd.  This is definitely one of my go to watering holes.

Oh and try the curry and fries, those are always a favorite when I'm at a good Irish pub."}
{"text":"Nice, cozy atmosphere, this is a great place to stop by for brunch or a pint if you like beer (which I don't). In the summertime, their back terrasse is a great spot to hang out in and oh-so-close to the water that you'll get a pleasant breeze on some of those hot, muggy days.
In the wintertime,the inside is super cozy, given that this is an older historical building with the low ceilings and woodwork and brickwork.

Service is pretty good, my one qualm is the food. It is no where as good as it used to be  and can be improved. You can't really go wrong with burgers, fries and onion rings but the other dishes have suddenly become bland. It's a shame since this place has great potential, being in the picturesque Pointe-Claire village."}
{"text":"All the pro's from my initial review stand.
Though I can't evaluate the air conditioning this time of year, getting a table next to the fire ensured we were toasty from minute 1.
I was skeptical of recent reviews about the food would only trust my own taste buds when benchmarking a pub which I hold in high esteem. Unfortunately, I have to agree that the food has taken a downturn. My sweet potato fries tasted stale and twice fried. It's a shame because greasy foods are what fodders my drinking and what will ultimately push me to buy just one more round. The quality was far from justifying the price, which should include the curry mayo they tack on for $1.
I'll of course be back, but I'm unsure if it will b for food. I'll have to judge by the reactions of my fellow Yelpers"}
{"text":"I meet some friends that live in the dark side of town (CSL) so this was a great place to meet not that far from a metro.
Loved the atmosphere in this place and cool nachos as well. I have much better place to go near me (Mile End), but I guess if Im in the area of Monkland this will be my 1st choice."}
{"text":"Great location on bustling Monkland Avenue. A quick stumble to/from the Metro which is always nice. Service was pretty good and they pour a mean pint. They got the food out fast even though we were a pretty big group plus there were no errors in the bills which is sadly all too common in lots of places. It may look full in the front, but if you keep walking past the bar, there are more tables in the back as well so don't be scared when you first walk in. 

Overall, I'd say it's a good little neighbourhood pub: crowded and fun."}
