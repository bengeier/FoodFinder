{"text":"Hands down the best (and most consistent) Thai food in Toronto. I was introduced to this gem over a year ago and it has become a weekly staple for take-out or delivery (yes... They deliver too! I haven't had a bad dish... Ever!

The Pad Thai is top notch. As are the Tom Yum Soup and Cashew Beef.

However, the real winner on the menu is the Panang Curry (I usually order it with chicken). It comes with ginger sticky rice that is to die for."}
{"text":"Excellent place for Thai and Asian food.

I have been eating here for years and have always had an enjoyable experience. The waiters are friendly and are there to help, but aren't constantly hovering over your shoulder while you eat.

Some of my favourite dishes at seven east include the general tao's chicken (deep fried and coated in delicious red sauce) and the glass noodles (light noodles that are stir fried and seasoned well). They make all their soups from scratch so I would definitely go for the tom yum soup as well.

Their menu has something for everyone, and you can always order for delivery if you don't feel like stepping out of your home!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years! Delicious food, especially the spicy basil tofu and love that there are a variety of different types of rice to choose from besides the standard white, brown or fried. Definitely try either coconut sticky rice or ginger!"}
{"text":"I got a late lunch here in March. It was 2 pm on a Saturday and the place was empty; only one person was working, but he was great and service was good.

The lunch specials are inexpensive ($9-13) and come with rice, soup, and salad. Everything was tasty and made well, although I would have liked a bit more spice in the black bean sauce which the menu warned was spicy.  The hot and sour soup was the real firecracker, gooey and vinegary and full of chili flakes.

Portions are satisfying without being huge. You could come here for lunch and go back to work without falling asleep in a food coma at your desk.

Dinner prices are higher -- menu items seemed to range from $15-$25.

Not wheelchair-accessible -- you have to go up a step and turn 90ยบ to get in, and the washrooms are in the (oddly dark and clubbish) basement.

A solid three stars and a bit more. Minus points for the lack of accessibility and plus points for a tasty fried banana dessert."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and I'm always very pleased with eat in or take out food from Seven East. Dinner here has become a happy family tradition and it's our default destination for dining out. The owner is friendly and accommodating, and genuinely appreciates the business. Dishes are fresh and tasty.  Prices are very reasonable especially for Rosedale. Not a lot of seating but somehow we always find a spot. Take out and delivery too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was like a second home to me. Delicious and I miss it. Ted, please come back."}
