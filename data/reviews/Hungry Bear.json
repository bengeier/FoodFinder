{"text":"I love this inexpensive restaurant.   The food is good and service is wonderful.  It's like have breakfast at with friends and family.  The staff is intuitive to see when you just want to eat and run or sit and chat awhile.  One of my favorites"}
{"text":"Great food, low prices. Your basic mom and pa dinner, but definitely worth the stop! Great service too! Everything is freshly made, and nothing seems like it's frozen! They easily have the best mac and cheese, and you can tell it's home made!  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Fed 2 of us for under $20!! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice little diner in the center of town. Breakfast was good, had a CBS Omelette which is Corn Beef and Swiss.  I got the Mama Bear size which was more than I could eat. Hash browns were crispy. Biscuits and gravy were OK. Looks like they have a long list of pies, unfortunately I don't have the room."}
{"text":"So The Hungry Bear. This is about as basic a diner as it gets. Good food, friendly people, lots of regulars....the works. It's everything you'd expect from a hometown diner. Put it this way...If you've never been here, I can describe it as the stereotypical diner that NBC news will be looking for during election season to see what \"regular folks\" are thinking about the upcoming election. Try it people, Americana is here."}
{"text":"Mmmm chocolatey shake! And 10 pies! Last place had only 1pie. At Litchfield circle, room for an RV."}
