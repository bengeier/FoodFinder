{"text":"Went there for dinner a few months ago. Had a great experience and the food was fantastic. It's a bit hidden in the shopping center, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Ended up being a great place for some drinks, appetizers and dinner. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"As a person with many dietary restrictions (gluten and dairy free) it is difficult to find restaurants that can accommodate. The service was excellent, and they were more than happy to accommodate, which was such a relief. The atmosphere, food, wine, and staff were all worth coming back for."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  I'm sure I've tasted everything on the menu and it's spectacular.  If you're in Phoenix for vacation, business or you live in the valley, this is one of three places I recommend.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here with friends for dinner before the symphony.  What a marvelous place! We started with cocktails at the bar - and that was the beginning of this unique experience.  The drinks were different, and the bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable / helpful in making decisions.  We had reservations and were seated promptly, and since there were 6 of us they put us at the central dining table. We felt like we were in someone's home - and were treated as such. Our waiter was also very attentive, and the food was delicious and perfectly prepared. We had to try the fig bruschetta since it had such rave reviews, and we were not disappointed.  This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar, minimal bartender was more focused on her cell phone than customers. Pizza cooks also on cell phones, WTH? Then she shattered a glass right next to the ice bin, continuing to make drinks with the ice. Not a good first impression."}
{"text":"Wow!! We had The Nook recommended to use by the concierge around the corner at the Renaissance Hotel. What a find! We were greeted by Nicolas, one of the owners, very upbeat, pleasant, and engaging! The server, Margeret was outstanding. But the food was absolutely amazing! We started out with the Shrimp Cocktail, super fresh, with a really excellent sauce, next we tried the Eggplant parm bruschetta, fabulous. We both ordered the Veal Osso Buco, huge, and fork tender! Nicolas suggested a wine, that was not on the wine list, it was outstanding, and not over priced. Dessert was also delicious! Next time we're in Phoenix, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place and I can't wait to go back! 

Went here with to celebrate my friend's birthday. We called ahead and they said that they wouldn't take any more reservations for that night, but would take my cell number and give us a call when a table would be ready. The hostess said it would take about 30 minutes, so we took our time relaxing at my friend's apartment and started heading over after about 20 minutes. It worked out great because while we were about to park the car (huge lot with plenty of spaces), we got a call from the restaurant saying our table was ready. I love when timing works out perfectly. 

We were seated quickly and our server, Nick, came to the table and greeted us. We told him we haven't eaten there before and we asked him for our recommendations. Everything he gave us was spot on! 

There weren't many of us and we just wanted to share so this is what we ate. We ordered the poutine with the fried egg and short rib. Got half orders each of the bruschetta with prosciutto, short rib, and beer braised short pork butt. And we also ordered the porco e funghi pizza with additional spicy soppressata. The meal was absolutely delicious. We also got the pumpkin spice cake and the restaurant put a candle on top for my friend to blow out. The restaurant owner even came out to the table and personally greeted us and wished my friend a happy birthday! 

The whole experience was simply top notch, from the hostess calling us when the table was ready, to the server having outstanding food recommendations, and to the quality of the food. It is definitely on my list of favorite places to go to and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm from the Chicago area and love to travel.  I use Yelp to find good places to eat - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  In the case of Nook, the rating was SPOT ON!  This place is truly amazing.  

Last night, we were in search of a late night dinner spot and Nook seemed to fit the bill.  I haven't been in Phoenix in years and in all honesty, I was skeptical as we approached.  Restaurants in strip malls don't often have an appealing ambiance.  Nook was a true exception.  

From the moment we entered, I knew it was a good choice.  We were greeted warmly by the hostess and grabbed two seats at the bar.  The vibe was perfect - a low hum of activity, GREAT music, and TVs silent with sports.  We asked about favorites on the menu (from a person who ended up being the owner) and went with the recommended Arancini, Fig Bruschetta, and Arugula salad - although I wanted just about everything he recommended.  All were outstanding - so much so that we ordered a second round of the Arancini.  And to accompany it, a beautiful glass of Saldo Zin.  The perfect pairing!  We ended with the Affagato dessert...so good and pretty much the best I've ever had.  

The service was outstanding as well - the bartender was friendly and extremely attentive.  My travel rule is never repeat a restaurant on the same trip....I might have to break it this time!"}
{"text":"Four words:  prosciutto and arugula pizza. Three words:  to die for!  My new favorite neighborhood spot. Oh and the short rib bruschetta?  Yowza!"}
{"text":"Nook is an excellent addition to the neighborhood. Everything we had was full of dynamic great flavor and the portions were perfect. From the Arancini, to Pork Bruschetta, to the Chicken Marsala, and finally the Bread and Butter Pudding, we were extremely pleased with the food, service, and price. Don't hesitate to give it a try. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Seriously bummed with our dinner last night!  The kitchen completely missed the mark!  Where to start... I guess with the positives... the service was great!  The poutine amazing! So onto the negative:  the warm caprese... no flavor and the toast points were gummy,  artichokes not cooked long enough, meatballs eh, the bruchetta.. again on gummy bread.  Salmon-simply off tasting, its sides seriously needing seasoning and we're cold!  Scallops also lukewarm, eggplant parm, while impressive looking- BURNT! Couldn't eat.  The chicken on my salad also burnt!  The pastas were flavorless!  Walked out with a 450 bill and felt robbed!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here and got food poisoning.  I contacted the owner and he denied responsibility, saying it takes at least 24 hours for foodborne illness to present, after ingesting the infected food.  The other food I ate leading up to my illness was the same home prepared food I had been eating all week, so I am certain that the filet mignon I had at nook was the culprit. I looked up the timeline for when symptoms present, and what I read indicated that symptoms can appear as soon as 1 to 6 hours after eating the affected food, which aligns perfectly with when my symptoms appeared.  See this link for confirmation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness 
This directly contradicts what the owner said about the timeline for symptoms. I will be filing a complaint with the health department and will not ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Pizza was on point! Chewy crust, fresh mozzarella and delicious topping! Sausage & mushroom and vingole will not disappoint. Manager stopped by the table to personally thank us and check in which was a nice touch. Good atmosphere, a nice addition to the Arcadia neighborhood- I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Tried it out today & have found a new neighborhood favorite...fun place...nice people & great food!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Great food. This was an anniversary dinner with my sons and their very lovely wife's on our 40th.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"was there about a week ago with my brothers and we enjoyed the sausage and mushroom pizza and a 4 station pizza. great crust and toppings. nice wine selection. like that they have garnacha. a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"What a fantastic culinary discovery!! The Nook has amazing and original Italian food. Not your basic tomatoes and pasta place. Their chef is world class with such dishes as the \"Pasta Crepe\" with sauteed chicken breast. Never tasted anything so delicious!!

What was a bit of a negative was the size of the place. It is tiny and looks like just a bar at first glance. Want this business to expand so many other diners may enjoy the taste delights I experienced here. They do have unique cocktails that my companion really enjoyed. 

Next time I plan on tasting more of the appetizer selection and one of the scrumptious sounding desserts. Worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to taste their amazing food this evening. It truly was a special dinner, everything was cooked to perfection. I come from an Italian family and this was the best eggplant Parmesan I've ever had. Chef Nick and his team do an awesome job. If you're in the Phoenix area, you NEED to stop in"}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away in a shopping center, I saw the sign but never knew what it was.  Turns out, this is the some of the best pizza in Phoenix!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Met some friends here for dinner last night. The staff is super friendly and was over the top catering to our needs. We got the gluten free arugula pizza, chicken chopped salad, salmon and a gluten free dessert (there's only one, can't remember the name). Everything was super tasty. Must try the cilantro mule, very refreshing.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was the noise level, very loud, hard to hear conversation.  Must be popular because only seats at bar aavailable at 6pm on fridaye night. Bar was overstaffed perhaps as the service of two different servers was soooooo attentive it bbordered on irritating (interrupting conversation to ask if we had questions about menu, drinks, refills, etc , at one point actually replaced my soggy cocktail napkin as I was sipping my water). Bar was also doing double duty as pizza oven, food prep, purse storage....generally cluttered & unsure of its purpose, maybe could be said of whole restaurant? The best part of meal were the pork butt & short rib bruschetta, my halibut tacos were also tasty, but the pasta crepe was bland & chicken overcooked. As a final note, it was very pricey (96$ for2 ) AND we were asked to move our seats. Not a great experience."}
{"text":"If you enjoy high quality pizza this place is a hidden gem!!!! It's located in a small strip mall, but don't let that detour you because once you walk in it has a Manhattan pizzeria ambience to it. The cheese, sauce, and dough is amazing. I think it's as good or better than Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience on a Sunday night sitting at the bar. We were pleasantly surprised by great service and we were able to watch the pizza chef prepare our food right in front of us.  The charcuterie board was delicious, fig jam and had pulled mozzarella were delicious. Lots of food on the board, we couldn't finish it all.  Both pizzas were fantastic with a good crust and a good red sauce.  The white pizza was awesome but I would've added mushroom to the calabrese, that would've taken it over the top.  The other pizza was the purco fungi which we added the sweet sausage to.  That was perfection.  Beer a little expensive but whatever, everything was tasty and service was good so you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The pizza I have ever had - and I was married to an Italian cook (who worked in a pizza restaurant in Parma (Langhirano) - Tira Tarde!

The BEST pizza is here folks - I never order pizza anywhere else any more."}
{"text":"Omg this place is the cutest little neighborhood joint.  Somehow reminds me of some of the little places that used to be along the train line in Chicago.  Maybe its the decor or the narrowness of the place , I cant really put my finger on it.  It just really doesn't feel like your in Phoenix.  

The welcome was warm and inviting.  The service was great.  Everyone was more than happy to explain menu items to us and make suggestions. 

We ordered The meat and cheese platter to start, it was all sooo good we were fighting over it.  we had both the Funghi pizzas white and red.  We definitely liked the red one better.  Nothing was wrong with the white one, maybe we just weren't big fans of seafood on pizza.  The owner took it off of our bill , we hadn't even eaten one piece of it .  The winner of the night was chicken Marsala .  So good it was everyone's favorite.   

We loved the place.  It's not cheap, we will be back for happy hour for sure.."}
{"text":"Cool place!  I like that they are open late and they have great food. The bartenders are super friendly and make great suggestions. The pizza is stellar and guess what...it doesn't need ranch!  Come on lady. 

Do yourself a favor and use the restroom, the scrub is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great  - even the gluten free pizza was good.   The service is good and they always greet you when you walk in the door which  only adds to the experience!"}
{"text":"The worst bar experience I've ever had. Bar tender was rude from the moment we sat down and it continued through out the service. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood is so lucky to have Nook! The food is incredible - the pizzas are delicious (my favorite is the funghi) and it is such a perfect spot for date nights or group nights! Plus you can head down to Dilly Dally afterwards!"}
{"text":"The food was great!!!! As well as the music and atmosphere!!! No complaints on the quality of food or the pricing but you would think that the server would reflect the casual but upscale environment here! Our server Ale was god awful!!! I swear she didn't say almost anything to us, a young man delivered drinks as well as asked us how we were enjoying our meal, Ale never asked us a thing nor gave us a nice send off!!! As someone who is in the industry as values the experience this was nothing to rave about. I suggest training individuals who can deliver that experience to go along with the vibe here!!! Great job everywhere else but Ale try to find your personality and make us want to come back!!! We will be sitting at the bar from now on!!! 
Cheers"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a wonderful dining experience. The atmosphere is upscale and the food is fantastic. Our group sampled the salmon, Chicken Marsala, short rib, pizza, and roasted olives. Every dish was a taste treat. The perfect spot for a group or a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Good service, cozy little spot but the food.... Not so great. The salmon dish is SO bland and was not cooked how we ordered it :( We should have sent it back but joked it down anyway. The hummus dish was ok. Sad to say but the food was huge let down after all the great reviews."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and fell in love with this restaurant. The food, staff and drinks are all amazing. Some of the coolest people work here, they are very knowledge about their products and make great suggestions. I love coming here alone or with friends and family, I always feel welcomed"}
{"text":"Nook is the place to go and hang out and eat delicious and when i mean DELICIOUS, the food is Delicious on so many levels! But let's start from the beginning, when you walk in the hostess welcomes you with a smile so pleasant, sits you down and for the first couple of minutes you just stare at all the amazing architectural of this resturant, which is vintage,yet modern. Our Server Jason welcomes you and hands you the menu and asks if you have any questions. Looking at the menu is very easy to see why this is their second location. The food was  spectacular.  I ordered the Monroe Burger, really didn't know what to expect, since it was my first time. But when it came out our whole table reacted in \"OMG that's a huge burger\". I was stunned! The Monroe Burger was more than i had expected in a burger, soooooo many flavors, so many textures, it really took me on a culinary experience all in one bite!! Nook is the only place that i have been to that a burger takes me on a culinary mouth-watery adventure. And will highly recommend it to anyone! So do yourself and your stomach a favor and go try this amazing place. And on top of that the people make you feel at home, just in a fancier/yet casual way and you are supporting a great local business!!

Thank you Nook for a WONDERFUL experience! 
Surely will go again!!"}
{"text":"Nook is my favorite neighborhood restaurant. Outstanding drinks, amazing pizzas, and friendly service - Ale and Matt make you feel like you are visiting an old friend."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Nook for our usual Saturday night dinner date, and I am so glad we did. Our entire experience at Nook was very enjoyable.

We started out by trying some of their craft cocktails - make sure you get the Rosemary's Baby! It's a different and refreshing take on a margarita, with rosemary and red bell pepper. Seriously delicious.

We also each enjoyed our own pizzas (i'm vegetarian, he is not) and we both loved our selections. The pizza, along with the caprese bruschetta, made for a delicious dinner.

However, my favorite part of the meal was our desserts. Starting out with their Cacao Americano cocktail, I thoroughly enjoyed their delicious take on strawberry shortcake. Strawberries, lemon cookies, basil ice cream - to die for! This is a must have for anyone who wants to try something a little different, but a lot delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent environment. Would recommend the Grilled Romain Salad, Charcuterie plate, Ribeye and Scallops in particular but everything tried so far is good.  Some delicious cocktails too, I like the Rhubarb and Rye very much. 

A good location for events downtown,  but a good night out in its own right.  Very close to the light rail for the park'n'riders too."}
{"text":"They have a nice looking interior. Pretty decent drinks here. Our food, also okay. 
not much going on nearby. why is downtown so dead and empty?"}
{"text":"Nook is a great restaurant. We frequent it regularly since it's right around the corner from us. The staff is always very nice and we always receive excellent service.  We've tried about every single pizza they offer and they're all amazing! I always recommend Nook to anyone visiting!"}
{"text":"The BEST food I've ever had while visiting the Phoenix area. The espresso steak meal is to DIE FOR, the deconstructed Moscow mule is heaven and the gooey butter cake for dessert.....pure sin!! I loved every bite of everything! I will definitely return ASAP!"}
{"text":"Great food...actually 5 star food (though salad portions could be larger.) This review is based on the personality of the staff. Hostess unwelcoming. Servers the same. This is the third time we've been here and it's tough to want to come back when you know the staff is a little chilly.  Great live music on Tuesdays...perfect volume and choice of music. Please make some changes nook so we want to come back. Too many other choices in our hood..."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance is fantastic!    We shared the artichoke, caprese salad and scallops.  Wow!  The sauce on the scallops is amazing.  We had great service too!  Request Margaret- she is a seasoned professional who makes the dining experience that much better!!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Amazing food , spot on staff and great ambience! This place is a must go while in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Very small restaurant. Went for lunch and ordered a chicken salad and it was very bland. I may try this place again as most of the reviews on here are great...but the salad was definitely nothing special."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food and all around atmosphere. Everyone we came into contact with was super friendly and we got lots of perks/free samples while we were waiting for our food! I'm writing this review days later and I'm still raving about the food and the service!"}
{"text":"Love it!!!

Great place!  Great food! Great drinks! 
We sat at the bar and people were friendly.  Ordered a cocktail and it was spot on.  Then had roasted olives and poutine ( don't judge!! ). Ohhh my gosh both were fantastic!  We split  those dishes between 2 of us but could have served 3-4 people. 

We definitely needed something on the lighter side so had the Arugula salad.  It was nice and refreshing!.  
No we couldn't eat everything as much as we tried!! 

I'll be back there soon!"}
{"text":"The place is awesome. Happy hour menu has a great chop chicken salad. Ingredients all fresh, dressing not too heavy. Happy hour menu has many light choices ~not fried. The atmosphere is friendly, modern, industrial. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"I love this place. Smaller. Very nice and all the feel good food you could want. We had the risotto balls, short rib gravy French fries, a margarita pizza and the mushrooms sausage pizza with a crisp beer. Awesome. The food quality is high and all the employees were happy to be there working which says a lot to me."}
{"text":"I love this place! My girlfriend and I went here last Sunday the video editing was chill , the bartender was cool and I liked the way I could watch them make my pizza while sitting at the bar, oh and did I mention that pizza was amazing. Look out we may have just become regulars."}
{"text":"The service was great. The place had a great look and feel to it. I appreciate that they reached out to do something different with the bruschetta but I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Phoenix, the steak was perfectly cooked, the appetizers were delicious and the service was great friendly staff, they agreed to change few stuff in the food for us!"}
{"text":"We stopped in before we went to a concert a the Celebrity Theater.  It was Happy Hour so we had a couple of glasses of wine and two appetizers. All tasted great!  Our server Ame did a excellent job and was really cheery. The only downside was that the last table left was by the front door.  It was a little chilly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We visited prior to the Symphony 4/1/17. It's a nice space with a large bar and seating area. We opted for a table with the large, comfy chairs since we had a choice. It's a short menu with many pizzas, some gluten free selections and a nice craft cocktail and wine menu. We weren't super hungry so we shared three plates, the meatball appetizer, poutine and the mushroom,  spinach, mozzarella pizza (gf). All items were tasty and well presented, but not outstanding in any way. Our waiter was attentive and informative and willing to engage in polite conversation.  He had great timing, when to stop and ask and when to walk by. I had a cocktail made with a Japanese whisky and my wife had another of the craft cocktails.  Both were excellent.  I would rate the drinks higher than the food. Reason, the smoothness and blending of the flavors. Been to many of the area bars attempting craft cocktails and I found these as good or better than all in presentation and flavor. I think this is a great spot, not outstanding,  but above average.  If you are going to an event at Symphony hall or the Herberger  (each a block away) give it a try for a light meal or stop by after for a cocktail."}
{"text":"What can I say about my love affair with the Nook. I crave this food. Favorites include the warm olives with beautifully spiced olive oil dipping sauce and bread, the grilled artichokes, and the pizza margarita. Awesome! Pizza is truly the best in town....yes, even better than Chris Bianco. Hubby loves the chicken Marsala so we order one to take home and eat the next night. Even better the second day. All of this washed down by well chilled Pinot Blanc ( super tasty) and attentively served by Ale, who is as nice as they come. Funky , fun SF atmosphere. It just does not get any better in terms of quality of experience in our hood."}
{"text":"Just tried Nook for their happy hour. It was delicious!  I highly recommend the beer braised pork butt bruschetta. It was phenomenal. Even my 2 year old who isn't a huge fan of meat couldn't get enough. I look forward to going back for the wood fired pizza and to try their short rib bruschetta. Oh, and the server was great, friendly and attentive!  I'm excited to come back to further explore the menu!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Comfortable and cozy ambience. Very friendly staff. We were interested in pizza and our server advised us to split a pizza and a salad. We had the Porci and Fungi Pizza and the Arugula Salad. Excellent and just the right amount.  Good wine choices and my Anchor Steam was perfectly chilled. The owner (Frank) stopped by more than once to check on us. A new favorite!"}
{"text":"Really cute place. The price is affordable. Kind of a hipster feel to it. Ambiance is good for a date or a day out with friends. Full bar. And i recommend the pizzas."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on a whim while waiting for our flight home from Phoenix. We are so happy we found this place! Great ambiance, great food and even better staff!! Hannah was our waitress and she could not have been nicer, more outgoing and genuinely happy. She made the experience! We both ordered a pizza, and being from NY we didn't have high expectations, but boy were we wrong!  Both pizzas we ordered were extremely light and full of flavor! Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service, and our server Ale, pronounced Allie, remembered us from over a month ago the first time we tried NOOK. Everything on the menu is delicious, and it's a perfect to take friends n family."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. I have lived in the neighborhood for four years and also work at a restaurant in Arcadia. They did a great remodel, considering what it was before. Super cute, great atmosphere. The wine list was very good and so was the food! The arancini's were good. I ordered the steak which was cooked to perfection. I subbed out the risotto for cauliflower mash, which was the best I have ever had. Overall I wasn't expecting to get a steak but I'm glad I did. My friend got the Diavola pizza which was simple but good, spicy in fact. And a lot of pizza. We finished with the bread pudding which was great. Nice crust, tart fruit and caramel ice cream. And Matt really took care of us! Overall a great experience, and a great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Such a fabulous place! Went in tonight on a whim and we are so glad that we did. The atmosphere has a calm, hip vibe. The food is very good. We enjoyed several of the bruschetta appetizers, a couple of salads, a pizza, and the olive oil orange cake for dessert. Our sever, Ralph, was terrific. He was attentive and quick. At the end we realized we had to leave earlier than expected and Ralph quickly boxed up our leftovers and packed up our orange cake to go. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but this place knocked me off my feet in the best possible way. My family ordered a fig bruschetta appetizer that was a 10/10, i ordered halibut tacos. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with not only the inviting atmosphere but the attentive service and delicious food. We showed up for the Sunday pizza wine special and were not disappointed... authentic Neapolitan pizza and really good wine. Will come back again for sure :)"}
{"text":"Nook has become one of our regular spots for dinner. The pizza is as good as it gets in Phoenix and they have a solid, well priced wine list. On one occasion they were out of the bottle I had ordered so the owner offered to swap out a similar (and more expensive) bottle from his own collection for the same price. It's that kind of service that sets them apart from other places. 

We always have great servers. They are very attentive and well informed about the menu and can provide helpful selections if you're undecided."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We came here for dinner last night and were really impressed. 

The pinot noir on tap (only $5 on happy hour) was perfect. We shared the calabrese pizza which was amazing. I can't wait to come back and try the beer braised pork butt brushetta. 

The restaurant has the exact layout of The Grind and is a great spot for happy hour or dinner with a date or small group. They also have wonderful service. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It's little name barely describes the huge ambience and flavor this place has.  Skeptical because the previous two business which previously came and went, I entered and was pleasantly surprised how the owners created an atmosphere which you would expect to find in quaint little neighborhoods bordering the west coast and especially in the wine country. The staff were welcoming and relaxed as they displayed their knowledge of the menu as well as the pairings. Our food was presented to us which is quite refreshing since so many places simple \"serve\".  Appealing to the eye as well as the palette is why this hidden gem gets 5 stars. It's a great place to bring a date, a friend you just picked up from the airport or to bring that special someone that you wish to spend a remarkable evening with."}
{"text":"Nook is a staple restaurant that I have been frequenting over the years while on business in Phoenix. Excellent food, nice waitstaff, great atmosphere and interesting lineup of draft beers on tap. Besides their pizza, the Chicken Marsala is excellent. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had one of their white pizzas. It was fantastic! The only downsides to this place are parking and it is a little pricey."}
{"text":"I did Arizona restaurant week menu with the wine paring. I had the salmon. It was excellent!!! Ambiance is very nice. Will definitely come back!! Want to try their pizza. Looks great too.  Very cozy place. Nice friendly staff also."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Pizza w mushrooms and sausage was a hit. Wait staff awesome!  Attention to detail.  5 Starr's for sure"}
{"text":"Since the day Nook opened I have been in love. I love the staff, the ambience, the food, wine, the neighborhood people the frequent the bar - EVERYTHING. 

The staff is so accommodating to their guests. If they can do it for you, they will. No hesitation. They are friendly and genuine. 

The food. So yummy. And consistent! You know what you're getting every time. The pizza is so delicious and cooked right in front of you and then in their pizza oven behind the bar. I think they have one of the best charcuterie boards in the area at such a good price. Chef Nick makes some soups that are so good I've ordered them twice in one sitting. The desserts I could eat every day of the week for every meal. 

The decor is trendy, but current is a better word. It doesn't come off as pretentious or overdone. It's neighborhood cute but romantic at the same time. Something I would expect to find hidden in an alley in Seattle or something. I love the music choices. 

Overall a place to not pass up if you're in Arcadia."}
{"text":"First time to Nook! 
We were seated right away by a really cool dude who gave us our menus and we sit for not even a few minutes when our server Ralph came and took our drink orders

The first dude came back and answered all of our questions and then Ralph came with our drinks and also have us his two cents on his favorites as well and it didn't take us long to decide at all with all the details they both gave us. 

We ordered the \"porco de fungi\"? I think that's what it was called but it's was really really good(: 

The food was so good we ordered a second pie which was just the \"fungi\", a white pizza 

We're coming back :D"}
{"text":"Incredible! We had the charcuterie, olives, arugula salad and the filet with an amazing goat cheese sauce. House Malbec is incredible also! New favorite place !"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere tucked in a pretty usual strip mall. The food was really delicious, the staff was knowledgable, and we were excited to come back again. Definitely try the pork and hold out for dessert :)"}
{"text":"Oh my god amazing Thai fighter is an amazing drink. Chicken marsala and salmon!!!  5 stars.  Ale the waitress was amazing.  Everything she recommended was perfect.  We drove all the way from Peoria.  So worth the ride!!!!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch today. Heard it was terrific so I had high expectations. Was warned it was in a sort of strip mall so I wasn't expecting it to beautiful inside. 

I was not is disappointed! Pizza is fantastic! My husband had the red sauce pizza with mushrooms, fresh basil, and spicy soppresetta. BELLA, crust thin and delicious.Sauce fresh and amazing mozzarella. Place is not fancy, but it feels urban cool and if we lived closer wed be there all the time. Well done!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot in Arcadia!!!  The happy hour is fabulous, but the food is even better.  We had the Arancini, pork butt,  short ribs, Calabrese & finally the chocolate salami.  Everything was delicious!!   Service was perfect, with excellent recommendations and an unbelievable understanding of the menu.  We can't wait to go back, and work our way through this menu with complex tastes!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Loved the whole feel of the restaurant! Staff was awesome! Love trying new spots...  Definitely worth the drive from anthem."}
{"text":"We went to Nook today for the first time, and WOW are we glad we did! Nice place, with a good size bar down one side. From the moment we walked in the door and sat down at the bar, everyone there made us feel welcome. Carrie was great behind the bar, and we wish we knew the name of the guy who fired up our pizza for us a half hour before it was time! It was AMAZING!! They went out of their way to make sure we were happy. We will be back immediately! Go there, and get one of those pizzas in your face right now!!"}
{"text":"So we booked our rehearsal dinner here this weekend.  Problem is we told them the wrong date.  It was 15 minutes before all 58 guests were about to show up when we figured out the mistake.  My wife was mortified and I was frantically calling the place.  Within minutes I received a call from the owner Frank telling me to not worry about a thing, just give them a few minutes.  Staff was called, the kitchen staff wasn't phased, and the whole thing went off without a hitch.  Service was excellent and so was the food.  I cannot say how thankful my wife and I are for the team at Nook."}
{"text":"Definitely a treat... This was as close to northern Italian pizza I've had in long time. Simple & very well done. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a few weeks now and finally made it on by for a much needed night out at a new restaurant. The menu was small but had a lot of good options to choose from. We started off with the Arancini appetizer, which I must say was the star of the night. The risotto balls stuffed with mozzarella had a great flavor to it especially with the balsamic reduction sauce that came with it. We then decided to share the Arugula salad which in my mind lacked any flavor to it. I felt it was way underdressed and salted. After the salad we both shared the Chicken Marsala. The chicken was nice and tender, but I felt that once again the whole meal itself lacked any impacting flavor (salt,garlic,....)  Maybe my taste buds require more salt then the average foodie but salt = flavor in my mind along with butter, oil, garlic.......etc. Since we shared everything starting with the app, we decided to get a dessert. We both shared the Bread and Butter Bread Pudding, which was good with no complaints. The question I ask myself after this meal would be would I come back here? The answer is yes, but only for a drink and the Arancini appetizer."}
{"text":"Eh. It seems like we had an uncharacteristic bad experience at Nook, but I figured I would share. 

All in all, I would say if it's not happy hour, this place is pretty overpriced. We decided to do a little VDay pregame at Nook. Grab some drinks, a couple of apps and after some research it looked like this was a perfect choice as they did Happy Hour every day! Sweet. WRONG! Apparently there is no happy hour on Valentine's Day. Bummer dude. 

Oh well, we thought, I'm sure it'll still be fun. We each ordered a beer, and started looking at our food options. Everything looked delicious, so we asked our waiter. He said the Beer Braised Pork Butt and the Arancini. We went with it. After letting our waiter know that was all we were having, his demeanor noticeably changed. It was 3:30 on Valentine's. We weren't looking for dinner! Just a little stomach love in the afternoon. From that moment forward though our waiter, who initially seemed so cool, so hip, so human, became a heartless robot. Was he there, doing what he was supposed to? Certainly. But he was also made of metal and circuit boards and became incapable of feeling or showing affection. 

On to the next chapter in our saga: the food. The food came out quick, was set on the table, and we immediately looked at each other. That's it? 6 little cheesy balls and 4 pieces of bruschetta. The cheese balls were the size of ping pong balls, and the bruschetta was averaged size bruschetta: hot wheel car size. Was the food delicious? Heck yeah! Was the portion sized for ants? Probably. It was appetizers, but dang give us a little love. 

This brings us to the final chapter: the bill. After Mr. Jetson Waiter brought us our check, I almost let out an audible noise. $39. We had 2 beers, 6 cheese balls, and 4 bruschetta bites. $39. Seemed a little steep. No no no, seemed incredibly steep. Like I just got pick pocketed steep. We left wondering if it was a bad dream. It wasn't. So we went home and made grilled cheeses to warm our hearts back up. 

Nook is trendy and cool. But dang it's pricey for what you get. Maybe I live on a different value scale, but I would say go somewhere different or go on happy hour. (But not on Valentine's Day; there's no happy hour then)"}
{"text":"OMG. My favorite new place.  The staff is amazing. Nicolas and James are awesome.  The food is everything you imagine in your foodie dream!   Please
Give it a try.  I promise if you are not sooo happy I will be shocked.   
They are literally waiting for you!"}
{"text":"Nook is a nice addition to downtown--nice enough for a more formal business lunch or dinner and featuring an interesting menu. Attentive service."}
{"text":"Hooray for a new neighborhood hang! Just a mile down the street from us. The staff is super friendly and the food is pretty good. I recommend the arancini and the pizza. I had the salmon and it was rather rare and the veggies super salty but maybe it was just an off plate. Happy to go back and try new tings or stick to the pizza. The beer selection isn't bad either and the owner seems to be a cool guy. I think things will only get better now that they have some months under their belt."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. We sat in uncomfortable white chairs the service was okay I think she just was not in to us. The short rib dinner was on the dry side and on warm.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Order the fruity pebbles cake - you will not be disappointed!  I was skeptical when my friend ordered it, but I loved it and have been dreaming about having it again.  The pizza I've had here has always been good.  Don't let the strip mall exterior turn you away, the atmosphere inside is very nice, service is good, and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We had driven past Nook Kitchen a lot not knowing what kind of food it was.  We've been to Beckett's Table and love the food there.
My fiancé decided that we were going to try Nooks.  In fairness, I hadn't read the reviews until after we had dined there.  We usually take turns trying out new places.
First impression for me was -oh how cute!  It's cozy and inviting....sadly the feeling slowly changed throughout the course of our dining experience.
The hostess was really nice and sat us right away and our waiter Ralph was extremely nice and helpful.
We told Ralph that we hadn't been there before and asked for his recommendations.
We started with the tongarashi popcorn and beef carpaccio.  The popcorn was fun it didn't want to fill up on it.  Though the carpaccio was good, it lacked a little acidity - a lemon wedge would have made the dish.  Here we go....

My fiancé ordered the filet mignon (ordered as medium-rare) with red bell pepper polenta and asparagus.  The filet came burnt, the polenta was loose and the display of asparagus was just sad.  

Me, I ordered the grilled salmon with parsnip purée, fingerling potato and haricot verts.  My salmon was cooked to almost perfection and the parsnip purée was very tasty.  The fingerling potatoes were a bit on the raw side and I almost choked on the haricot vert because the ends hadn't been trimmed.

My fiancé advised Ralph of the over cooked filet (it came well-done).  Ralph was a little mortified since it was a dish he highly recommended.  He took it back to the kitchen and advised the chef.  When Ralph returned he told us that the chef advised him that's how the filet should have been because of the mushroom crust.  Ummmm...sorry no. 

Ralph asked if my fiancé wanted to order another filet or another dish.  He opted to order the chicken with tamarind mashed potato and a balsamic reduction and cipollini onions.  It was alright.  The chicken was slightly overcooked.

About 30 minutes later the GM came over to apologize for the filet and offered us a complimentary dessert.  We got the apple cake with ice cream.  Sadly the cake was very disappointing.  It was super dense and not even the ice cream could help it.

Maybe they had an off night, maybe we had an off dining experience.  But the sheer fact that the chef never took the time to come and chat with us..well that was a deal breaker.  Needless to say, we more than likely will not be returning to Nook Kitchen.  For the experience and the final bill, I would have rather gone to Beckett's Table as I know that Chef Justin cares about what he puts out."}
{"text":"We went for our first time about 2 months ago! Have been back 2 more times. Very good pizza and other dishes. Nice selection of beers and service is great! The wait staff have always make suggestions to make your dinner even better with little adjustments to the order that are special. The owner gives his personal touch and came around every time to make sure all is ok? It is our new neighborhood pizza joint! PS tons of gluten free stuff even the pizza and it is very nice!"}
{"text":"Wow! Thought I had found a comfortable pizza place in the hood, The Nook. I enjoyed the food and I had recommended it to some of my colleagues. Then it happened. Some minor confusion over seating. To be honest after standing at the bar for 15 min waiting for something to open up I was a bit too eager to take a seat at a table that had just vacated. My bad! something the hostess pointed out with a vicious glare and something muttered as she walked by with another couple. So I was embarrassed, really embarrassed. I didn't realize she was trying to seat the couple at that table. That didn't register because those folks were 15 min behind us. Well damn that's awkward. Within an instant a second staff arrived, sent by her to ask if I had permission to occupy said table. No use explaining that the bartender gave us the heads up that people were leaving. Did I say I was embarrassed but then again something else, now I hadn't any desire for that pizza. My date and I were so uncomfortable we simply told the second staff that we wouldn't need the table and we left. It gets worse. I thought I had better call back and speak with the manager, instead I got Frank (one of the owners). I began by telling him how embarrassed we felt, his response was that I didn't really have any concerns to be embarrassed, and that he didn't know what I wanted from him. He said that his staff were appropriate. Damn i wanted him to validate my hurt feeling. Well it didn't happen and I'm still feeling a little put out. So what about service recovery I'm thinking. No need for that, right Frank? So frankly, I'm mad and thinking where else in the hood to get a pie without all this drama. That ought to be difficult in Arcadia. Later my date explained to me that that's what discrimination feels like. I'm trying to chew on that. Like so many i want to deny that people judge but I know they do. That's hard for a Wyoming boy to comprehend. Maybe she's right she has felt that sting many times. I know it felt pretty bad so I told Frank and the good folks at The Nook adiós and no more positive recommendations from me. Even that didn't seem to affect Frank. Frank, it seems, is very self assured. Sometimes, it seems, service recovery just is not worth the cost."}
{"text":"I am allergic to dairy - the chef put together an exquisite lemon chicken with fresh pasta- delicious! My wife had the chicken Marsala which she indicated was one of the best she has had! One of the owners checked in as well - nice touch."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, but we were very disappointed that we had to wait more than 35 minutes for our food to arrive at our table. We were told that we and at least three other parties had ordered our meals at the same time and that was making things challenging for the kitchen staff. And this was at 8 p.m. on a Tuesday! 

The chicken chopped salad is great and the yummy, Parmesan-dusted potato wedges that accompany some of the meals are wonderful. But we really don't plan on going back anytime soon because the wait was really annoying."}
{"text":"Saldo Zin. Pork Butt bruschetta. Chopped chicken salad. Chicken Marsala. Absolutely incredible. New favorite spot."}
{"text":"I came in from Orlando and have been here for the past few nights!! The staff is amazing and the food is incredible!!
Roberto, Tyler and Emily know their stuff and can make you any cocktail you can dream of!! 
One great experience!!"}
{"text":"Having been customers of Nook on Indian School, we recently visited this location before a theater event.  My husband and I shared the calabrese pizza and grilled romaine salad with a pinot noir.  We sat at the bar, the food was delicious and it was a lot of fun.  It's so great to see successful restaurants in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love, love, love the Quattro Formaggi Pizza! Best white pizza ever! The owner is really awesome and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"We stopped into the Nook for a late dinner after flying into Phoenix, because it was close to our hotel.  Quite possibly one of the best dinner choices ever.  Our server, Drew, was personable and funny and made us feel welcome right from the start, and the food was insanely good.  We ordered the meatball appetizer, which was delicious and just the right size for two, and a Diavolo pizza.  Normally anything Diavolo is pretty spicy hot, but the pizza had just enough heat (from the soppressata) to keep things interesting, and again was just right for two people.  Now, a pizza's a pretty simple thing.  There's a fine line sometimes between a truly outstanding pizza and just a pizza.  This pizza was outstanding - great crust, great ingredients, cooked to perfection.  Drew was there throughout checking up on us, answering our silly questions about Phoenix history,  and just generally giving excellent service.  The Nook has a pretty good wine list, although we did not indulge, and the music and overall atmosphere are comfortable and relaxing.  We would absolutely eat here again."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and dine out every meal.  I love finding the \"hidden gems\" in our area.  I have been to Nook twice and both experienced were disappointing.  This last time, I went with a group of 5.  We ordered a lot - arranchini, bruschetta, fries, burger, salads.  All were very mediocre. There was only 1 other table occupied and 2 people at the bar but, our main course took forever (and 4 of us had salads)!  Once we were served, 1 salad dragged for approx 5 minutes and we all sat there waiting - No apology, no explanation.  My brother and I left and both said we won't go back."}
{"text":"If you fee like overpaying for average pizza while 80s music is playing in the background and you have to yell to hear each other this is your place.  Paid $90 for 4 drinks and 2 pizzas.  The service was great and decor was nice but I would rather spend $30 at MyPie pizza."}
{"text":"I have to applaud the amazing staff at Nook for handling our large, boisterous group of business travelers with both amazing service and friendly demeanors. We were there for roughly 3 hours and they kept our drinks full with smiles. The food was excellent. We had 10 diners and everyone was very happy with their meals...a feat not often achieved with this size (and assortment) of people.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place has good food.  We had the filet, the scallops, the chicken parm and they were all first rate."}
{"text":"Nook kitchen is my favorite neighborhood restaurant. Actually, drop the neighborhood part of that last sentence. Nook is a great restaurant. The staff and the food are hard to beat. The second time we went we were treated like old friends. Everything on the menu is good.. And I've tried most of it. The pasta crepe is amazing and wish to find a special place in my will for the chef who invented this dish.  When we don't want a whole meal, it is easy to fill up on pizza and appetizers. All tasty which makes it hard to choose!! The deserts are great. Save room for them. Get the ice cream.. Great!!! Currently they are not serving the \"Nooker-doodle\", (which is in my opinion the best and served with cinnamon ice cream.. Yum) but the Fruity Pebbles desert is amazingly good. 
As I said before the staff are all great. I am not a picky eater but I am picky about service. Ally has always been our favorite. 
Go tonight for a great time!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. This place never disappoints. I'm in love with the poutine. Great atmosphere and perfect for a date night or drinks with friends. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time at Nook was for a friend's birthday a few months ago. It was still happy hour when we went in and ordered pretty much everything on the happy hour menu. I was no unsatisfied with anything that I tried. Everything was so fresh and delicious. 

Have been back a few times since and this place is still as delicious as it was the first time. The Florentino pizza is my favorite and the ca prese brushcetta is small  but tasty. Can't go wrong in chosing this place for a date night or delicious bite to eat."}
{"text":"I took my fiance here for our first date ever! We love coming back to this amazing place! All the pizzas are phenomenal! and the service is friendly!"}
{"text":"Couldn't resist another meal at Nook . . . especially the Arancini  . . . I'm totally addicted!!  I just have to high five this place another time for its fabulous food and friendly atmosphere. This time, not only were we greeted by Frank, but we were introduced to their adorable and talented Chef Nick who by the way was just featured in the Phoenix New Times.  I love a place where they treat you like family and appreciate your patronage!"}
{"text":"Great place! I like to sit at the bar because the bartenders are usually pretty entertaining. From the moment you sit down, you realize that you are going to be in for a treat. The servers are well prepared, very knowledgeable and quite attentive. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They brought out a burnt pizza and asked if that would be okay for us because \"some people like it that way.\"  We accepted it because we're easy-going but to do that is weird.  The halibut was bland, salad dressing bland and the burger was a quarter of the size of the bun and overall was mediocre. Sadly we won't be back, we love the location and we would love to see the potential."}
{"text":"I went to nook last night for happy hour and the food was amazing! The shrimp bruschetta was so flavorful, and the chopped salad was great, much larger than I expected

I have also been for dinner and the chicken entree is amazing! 

Matt was behind the bar and was giving us great wine pairings with the food, nook is worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Great experience...super friendly staff. AMAZING food, beautiful display of food! The olives for an appetizer are a must....as are the scallops. Craft cocktails are very fun and worth repeating."}
{"text":"Well worth it! Excellent HH, excellent pizza (not on HH) and amazing desserts ( affogato and snicker doodle tart). We were sufficiently surprised at the quality of food and tastiness of everything. Thank you for the excellent experience and great service."}
{"text":"Piss poor portions for what you pay for.

Too many spots around for these shenanigans, won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner!! Had the branzino, my hubby had their chicken Marsala.  Both outstanding 
Easy walk from out  hotel near the convention center. The butter cake was amazing. Highly recommend this restaurant in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came here before a Suns game. I'll definitely be back! We ate some great appetizers and they had a good selection of beer."}
{"text":"A very cozy shotgun shack of a place with the bar on one side and tables on the other.  I had the Pasta Crepe and it was delicious!  Grilled chicken and green beans on top of a crepe made with pasta inside and covered in a wonderfully rich sauce.  My wife had the honey/maple glazed pork chop with sweet potatoes.  Also terrific.

The seating was very comfortable and we had excellent service.  The music wasn't too loud and the decor was classy and casual.  We will definitely be back!

p.s. the waiter said the Pasta Crepe was soon to be replaced on the menu - so hurry in while supplies last :-)"}
{"text":"I have visited three times and for lunch and once for dinner. I would go back for lunch. It's solid lunchtime fare if you're downtown. Good, efficient service and you can get out of there for under $20. Dinner is a different matter. It's in hotel of
course so you're going to pay a premium. But boy did we feel like we were eating hotel food. We start with an inspired garden salad and then had a boring, bland eggplant Napoleon ($23!!) and totally meh salmon with over salted cauliflower mash. I might go back just for pizza or a drink but won't touch the dinner entrees again unless I get snowed in the hotel."}
{"text":"What an amazing place. Tucked away and cozy interior, the atmosphere is very intimate. Servers were extremely attentive and polite. The food was amazing. My wife and I shared the hummus as an appetizer. I really liked that it came with vegetables which is a lighter change up than most hummus plates. We also shared the pork butt bruschetta which was like eating candy. Our last item shared was one of the pizzas, the Giardino. The crust was cooked to perfection, just enough crunch without being over done and the toppings again created a sweet mix of notes in my mouth. It is the second time my wife has been here and we will be sure to visit often."}
{"text":"Best pizza this family has had anywhere ~ as the evening went on the menu only got better.   My husband took my boys and me out for my birthday dinner..   he suggested we try Nook and we were game.   
It quickly shot to the top of our all time favorite restaurants...  Service was top notch, owner stopped by to inquire how we were, and our food tasted as good as it looked *and it all was gorgeous.*  
We will be back, what a wonderful evening we had ~ we highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was really impressed with the food and service of this place.  The restaurant is not huge tucked away in a strip mall.  Decent wine list.  Really great pie. One of the best I have eaten.  We all order red sauce so I can't comment on the white.  The other dish that was a hit were the halibut tacos.  I didn't taste them but the DH liked them very much.  Would now go back again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Nook has become our \"go to\" place for dining out.  Great food, casual and cozy  neighborthood atmosphere, and a tasty lineup of brews on tap.  The pizzas are excellent."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Beats, by far, the pizza at some of the other highly rated pizza places. Will definitely be back. 

PROS: 
1. Amazing pizza
2. Awesome dessert (affogato)
3. Super kind and friendly owner (Frank)
4. Comfortable atmosphere with a cool neighborhood hangout vibe."}
{"text":"Nothing special-just ok. Staff could use a dose of personality. Not a smile to be found."}
{"text":"Seriously,  I rarely rant and rave... but last night's dinner at the bar with my wife was amazing!   

Living and dining in the 85018 zip code area for the last few years has got us spoiled with all the great places to dine.

But what separates our experience from others was the TOTAL package:   Quality of food, knowledgeable wait staff (everyone) and ambiance.  They ticked all the boxes and now it's not if we go back, it's WHEN.

Ultimately, if you prefer 'mom and pop' establishments , where the owner is present, helpful, and does whatever it takes to make your experience memorable (even if it's just a $50 check) - you've found the place!

We were so impressed by their genuine desire to make sure we enjoyed ourselves.  From cocktails,  to appetizers,  to dinner their suggestions were based on our answers to their questions.  They seemed like they were there to help and serve - and did a masterful job.

Highly recommend it!  It is now on our 'we will be a regular there' list...  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here today. Very nice choices on a simple menu. Appies were just right. Beer was just right. Seating was a little tight for four in a booth. Will go again. Ask for Jorge."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite neighborhood restaurants. Amazing food, handcrafted cocktails and excellent ambience-- whether you're looking for a slightly upscale place to watch the game or a fun place for girls night out, Nook is perfect. 

At this point we've been multiple times and ordered a lot of the menu. My favorite app is Arancini. Amazing cheesy rice balls in marinara, I would come just for these. Any of the pizzas we've ordered have been killer. Our favorite is the calabrese- sweet sausage, caramelized onions and Calabrian chiles-- perfect. 

Bartenders and wait staff complete the upscale chill vibe. We never have to worry about the quality of the beverages we get no matter what we order. My favorite, obviously, is their version of the Moscow Mule. Give it a try. Xoxo"}
{"text":"Wow! This place has been open for 15 months--how have I not heard of it before now? Good wine by the glass options and decent bottle prices. The table next to us got extra fancy wine glasses because they bought a more expensive bottle. Strange, but ok. 

We started out with arancini. Wish they had been a bit hotter, but they were yummy. 6 to an order. We also got two types of meat on bruchetta. Those were tender, flavorful and delicious.

We ordered two pizzas. The waitress said they had 6 slices but came with 8, and we thought it was plenty for two people. The pizzas were delicious.

We sat at the community table. Very nice inside; lively atmosphere. Try to get a reservation if you can. Great service. We were very happy!"}
{"text":"Lovely outside sitting area. Inside dark. I ordered eggplant bruschetta which arrived lukewarm and greasy. 
The grilled chicken salad was okay but not great. 
Service okay. Would not go back"}
{"text":"How's it that I keep finding such great places here in Phoenix? I ordered the Porco e funghi pizza and arugula salad. Both excellent, but the best part was the service. I was delayed picking up the order and the pizza got cold. They warmed it up for me but offered me a drink while I waited. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went here opening week. Great pizzas in their amazing oven. Healthy and quick. Somewhat wierd location in a strip mall, but that's the area."}
{"text":"We went there on a Tuesday night and it was pretty full. Our waiter was awesome, super serving!. He knew the menu quite well and gave us great recommendations! We had the braised ribs and a pizza. We also had the baked olive appetizer, delicious! The outside of the building is nothing like the inside, looks are deceiving! We will most definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Grabbed takeout from Nook Kitchen during a business trip & decided to order the Mushroom Pizza & Beet salad

Asked if they could make the salad veggie (since it came w/ bacon plus a bacon-vinaigrette & they happily obliged.  Subbed the dressing for a blood orange balsamic which was a wonderful option.  The salad was mostly arugula - there were very few beets & goat cheese dollops.  So for a standard salad this was okay but guess I'd been expecting thick slices of beets w/ just a little frisee

The pizza was wood fired & had a nice crisp crust.  Lots of mushrooms - decent but prob would look elsewhere for dinner in the future.  This was okay but would not consider it a destination spot when in the area"}
{"text":"I have dined here numerous times.  They have a wood oven.  The pizza and olives are amazing!  The pasta has been consistently exceptional. The hostess is extremely nice and professional.  Bartenders and waiters are very friendly.  They have a great selection of beer and wine.  The atmosphere is great.  An overall exceptional place.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the employees are very genuine. The lamb was fantastic and fell right off the bone. My fiancé ordered the featured meal of the night, though she didn't enjoy it as much on the count of there being too much butter settled in the bottom of the dish. The restaurant owner so happened to notice her lack of interest in the dish, and very sincerely asked for her \"constructive criticism\" before he explained how the dish was prepared. After some good conversation and understanding, the owner thanked us for our opinion and didn't make us pay for her meal -- along with giving us free dessert. Overall, we were very pleased with Nook Kitchen and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!! Very simply put, WOW!
My friend and I were in the downtown area looking for a place to eat and came across this pleasant gem. 
The minute we walked in we were greeted with smile after smile.
We sat at the bar with Gabe who recommended a delicious signature cocktail. (We ordered a second round it was that good)
We had a few questions on menu items and all staff members were extremely helpful. 
We decided on the chicken artichoke bruschetta to start followed by the diavolo pizza. 
Lets just say my taste buds threw a party equivalent to the Times square ball drop.
I have nothing but great things to say.
Great atmosphere, service and food!
There are not enough stars to equate the amazing experience we have time after time."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The chicken Marsala is amazing. Excellent wine selection and excellent customer service. Perfect place for a date or get together with friends for those of you who love exquisite Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"I really want to be able to give Nook a four or five star review, since everyone else has spoken so glowingly about it, but unfortunately I didn't seem to have as positive of an experience as other reviewers. 

Don't get me wrong, Nook looks great. Nice, comfy booths, brick walls, TVs behind the bar. It reeks of a high-class neighborhood joint, which I imagine was the intention.

The problem is, it took my party of three 75 minutes to be seated. After we were quoted 30 minutes. Once inside it took another 45 minutes to get our food. Mind you, it was Friday night and the place was swamped. That's a whole lot of waiting around though. 

Once we got our food, no one was really that impressed. I had the hummus bruschetta, which while tasty, was a few dollops of ingredients on the tiniest pieces of toast ever. I didn't mind too much, because by that time I wasn't even hungry anymore, but it wasn't quite worth the price. 

Will I go back in the future? Sure, for lunch. I'd really like to like this place, and given the other reviews it sounds like we were there on an off night. I think I'll stick to the pizza though, and lower my expectations."}
{"text":"Damn this place is top notch. Perfectly cooked artichoke that me n my girl had. We also split a funghi pizza which was delicious . good ambiance . Best of all our waiter  Cory was an excellent waiter. very professional . Super good attitude as well. Get the man a raise! cheers Cory"}
{"text":"Love this place, delicious food and atmosphere is very calmness. I prefer this location to the downtown one. The menus are different and the feeling of the place caters to completely different crowds. Tried the Diavolo Pizza. Overall, LIKED!"}
{"text":"If im going to pay 25 dollars for a plate of pasta it better be good and needless to say i was severely disappointed. The bolognese was flavorless and portion size was small for the price. The other guests i dined with were disappointed with their meals as well. I would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"The menu is great. Something for everyone ... You have the classics and the twists. We enjoyed some of both. Caprese bruschetta and the BBQ pork butt bruschetta.  The nookerdoodle dessert was delicious and we had absolutely no problem finishing that off-- however, I do hope the pastry team may have had a bad day because there was hardly any shortening or compound ingredient in the tart of the dessert. It fell apart as though it was dry, rather than crumble as a tart should. A little too grainy because the coarse sugar did not melt into the crust.  Also, wishful thinking... Serve in a bowl or pasta plate ? It was so hard to eat ice cream etc on a plate !"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place due to the great reviews and I was not disappointed! The drinks were excellent, the poutine was heavenly, and though my lamb was a tad under seasoned, my husband's steak was amazing!!! Our server was amazingly attentive and so nice. He treated us like royalty. After tip it cost about $150 For the 2 of us to eat, so it may be reserved for special occasions only but it is my new favorite restaurant in phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"A group of six people, including myself, came here an hour to close this past Monday evening 1/2/2017, specifically to enjoy some desserts. 

The desserts that were featured online, on their website, were not on their menu when we arrived but instead three different ones entirely. We all went with the peanut butter crack pie and it was exactly as it sounds - DELICIOUS. 

However, the reason for only giving this review a 3-star rating is because of the way we were approached and felt upon entering the restaurant. Immediately upon entering, the host (male w/medium cut hair) approached us and asked how many, we said six and he grabbed menus, rolled his eyes and then proceeded to walk us to our table. He then went to the bar to inform the waitress that her table was seated in which he rolled his eyes again and glared at us off and on for a good 10 minutes after we had been greeted by our waitress. I am not sure what his deal was, but it hindered the experience from being worthy of 5-stars. Our waitress was very accommodating, friendly and attentive to us, constantly refilling waters and making sure we were happy. 

I can understand people having bad days, but if the first impression you give is not customer-service oriented, you will end up with more reviews like this and lose business, as there are plenty of equivalent restaurants forming in the area."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant with a group of friends. It was a busy Friday evening.  Our waiter was wonderful and helped us add extra people to our party.  Corey, our waiter, went out of his way to give us excellent service.  The food was delicious.  Nook Kitchen was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great happy hour .. $4 Titos .. Can't get a better deal! The bruschetta plates are all incredible... So delicious! The service is always good!"}
{"text":"Amazing food GREAT service. Have been wanting to come here for a while now and it was definitely worth the wait. I cant remember the name of the pizza  we had but it has sausage and mushrooms and the poutin frys with the fried egg and the bolognese.  They were all great.  The atmosphere was relaxed, trendy and has an intimate feel."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food was really good - especially the deconstructed sushi roll salad with salmon. The staff was also super-friendly. We brought our baby and toddler and it didn't phase them. The owner or manager even came over to see how our dinner was and comment on how great our kids we're being (which was being generous) and the guy making pizza gave our toddler dough to play with. Family friendly and good food. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new joint and decided on Nook, we are glad we did.  Like some of the other reviews have said all of the signs look pretty similar here so look around and don't just assume they left.  Well enough on that.

Nook is pretty small, It's a good name choice for sure.  Had no problems getting a table, but it was only about six pm on a Saturday.  The dining room is simple and straight forward, one wall is a long booth/bench with the tables having a chair facing the bench.  On the left as you enter is a good looking bar.  Service was great.  Really friendly, obviously a fan of what the kitchen is doing.

I had the chicken Marsala, it was the best I've ever had....the only one (usually I'm a Piccatta fan).  But this was pretty damn good, I especially liked the mushrooms...I'd sort of think they had been soaked in a decent Port but I think that is the Marsala wine, which I had thought of as like sherry before but anyways the mushrooms were great.  Oh and the fresh pasta, delightful.  She had the prosciutto pizza, again excellent.  I like the arugula mix on top.

Is this going to replace our usual favorite in the area? It just might."}
{"text":"Wonderful discovery and even more amazing are the arancini!! A must visit with great and attentive service. Great drinks and chill environment that's genuinely easy going. Affogato chocolate dessert is divine and unexpectedly stunning!!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome time with our experience at the nook last night.  \"Gray\" our server, who had also made our reservation, was amazing and really made our time their more personal with great wine and food suggestions. The warm caprese salad was something new and all ingredients were extremely fresh and the bread and cheese were all made in house. The kitchen was swamped from a conference that was in town so our wait time was a little delayed. We didn't really mind because the atmosphere there is very cool. However, Nick the manager wanted to comp the meal and offer deserts and more wine. We insisted on paying for the dinner but let him hook us up with the desert. The lemon cake with olive oil ice cream was decadent and light (all made in house as well). Anyone staying in town needs to find this Nook when you get the chance."}
{"text":"Love this place. We've been there twice in the past week. Wine selection is amazing. Happy hour prices are great. The pizza is right up there with the big players in town. Had fun visiting with Nick. It's connected to the Hilton Garden Inn which is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Love this local pizza nook! Outstanding staff from the hostess to the servers, bartenders and even the guys making the pies-- they all care and make for a friendly, attentive, seamless dining experience. Try the chicken chop salad and the red sauce mushroom and funghi pizza. 

Check it out. Awesome happy hour too. Keep doing what you're doing Nook!"}
{"text":"LOVE everything about this place. I used to live in Manhattan and this reminds me a lot of the restaurants there. It is quaint with an awesome ambiance. My boyfriend and I ordered pizza take out and loved it so much that we went back to spend our Valentine's Day dinner. We started with the arancini, he ordered the pork chop and I ordered the salmon pasta.. wow. Arancini was delish. The salmon pasta was no doubt one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had (and I'm Italian.. I know my pasta). My boyfriend devoured his entire plate.

There was live music, but not that loud obnoxious live music that you find in some places. The singer was really good! There is a cute small outdoor patio that overlooks a courtyard with a fountain. This is the most perfect date spot! I can say we will most definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I visited Nook back on Valentine's Day. Walking in you'll notice the atmosphere is warm and inviting, and upon further inspection you will undoubtably find that the food is delicious. Unfortunately, on my visit the service was deplorable. The server was slow and inattentive; granted it was a busy holiday, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt, but the straw that broke the camel's back is they charged me $70 instead of the $40 I was suppose to be charged. I waited for the server, he went to the register, and when he came back he said the difference had been refunded. Reluctantly, I took his work for it. I tried to call the next day, seeing as their location is not close to my house, but no one was willing to help. I still have not been refunded, and I'm sure I never will. Based on the other Yelp reviews my experience might have been a one off, but as a result I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for really good food.  Had the short rib for dinner.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Still a fan of the food and the atmosphere, would highly recommend to anyone. However last night we went and for the first time we had another server, Ralph Taylor is the name on the ticket.  He was not bad, but not personable, and gave us every impression he wanted us to move on so he could turn the table as fast as possible. Maybe because we do not drink, not sure, but even before we were offered dessert he was asking us if we were ready for the check. I had to say \"No, my son would like to have dessert please.\" He said \"Oh, okay\", then proceeded to get my son's dessert and drop the check at the same time before we even finished the entire meal. No offer for coffee, nothing.  Don't get me wrong, the service was fine in terms of speed and attention, but I do not like to feel rushed throughout the meal as that is not right when you spend $120 on two pizzas and two main dishes, plus a nice tip for the pushy dude.  In all o four previous experiences we were waited on by Ale and she is the one to go with as she has a great personality, takes care of us with great friendly service, and always makes us feel welcome. I am sorry I did not specify her when we made the reservation, but unfortunately I did not remember her name until we saw her last night after we finished our meal. Next time we will go with Ale and all will be good. Sorry, Ralph....you need to be a little more respectful of your tables. We are not herded cattle, but those that pay your wages, and we do deserve to be left in peace without being scurried out to make room for the next group that may or may not spend more $ on drinks and other higher ticket items. Food is awesome, and we love this place, just won't sit with Ralph again, prefer to go elsewhere if Ale is not available....my wife and kids agree by the way so we are all on board with last night's slight disappointment."}
{"text":"Came here for my hubbys birthday. Came early on a Saturday night and place was pretty empty. Our server, I can't recall her name was charming and very helpful with suggestions.  She was spot on with the drinks. I had wine and husband had beer that she recommended. Appetizer was the Arancini. We could have eaten that all night! We ordered the Porco E Funghi pizza which was a thin crust pizza that was cooked in their pizza oven. Again delicious. Dessert was the only miss. We ordered the Peanut Butter Crack Pie. Huge miss! Would have been much better if \"cookie\" was heated and not stone cold. With crunch being cold it was so hard that we nearly couldn't cut it."}
{"text":"Nook never lets me down! Awesome food, amazing staff, killer happy hour, and my favorite: half off wine bottles on Sunday. I love this spot! Bruschetta is great, poutine is phenomenal (add egg and the short rib), had the salmon last night which was perfect, topped it off with a bottle of Ken Wright Cellars Pinot Noir and a sip of chartreuse.. Perfect end to a perfect night."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on Sunday night for AZ restaurant week to try something new. We both ordered an appetizer, pizza, and dessert. Everything we had was delicious. My husband said it might be the best pizza he has ever had in AZ. Service was excellent, but restaurant wasn't super busy. We definitely want to go back even though it's a bit of a drive from our house."}
{"text":"Nice jazzy vibe. Background music provided by live musicians. Hummus plate is good. Best Chicken Marsala I've had in a long time. Good place to meet for after-work drinks or a date."}
{"text":"Yum. Pizza Funghi was super awesome. It's a small place - we got there around 8pm last night but they were totally full, so we got a drink and waited for 20 minutes or so. Service here is amazing... they are really tentative and everyone really cares about you. The guy with the black hair and chain necklace was one of the best servers we've ever had. These guys know what's up."}
{"text":"We were attracted to Nook because of the 5 Star ratings on Yelp.  Open table didn't even have it.  Their web site did not show a picture of the restaurant, and I was concerned about the ambiance. Well, this is no sports bar.  Despite the two TVs over the bar, this is a sophisticated, modern, cosy and quite place, perfect for an intimate dinner for two people or two couples.  Clean,  and smartly decorated, with comfortable booths and cute menus.  Happy hour prices till 6pm.  They have a limited menu, which is a good thing.  The staff were sincerely happy, friendly, attentive, knowledgable and efficient.  The food was excellent in freshness, presentation, and flavor and cooked to perfection.  Remember to ask what things mean on the menu, like langestino, and salami for dessert(actually chocolate and nuts with dried fruit).  From the fried rice balls and short rib bruchetta appappetizers to the Bread pudding, you can't go wrong at Nook."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing the bartenders are friendly. Great atmosphere... Chill but classy.. Food is very good and they make some great drinks.. Kyle was fantastic (bartender) definitely heading back."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing! The food was delicious and large portions! The ambiance was beautiful and awesome to meet with my group of girls and the service was on point. Didn't have to ask for refills or nothing. All in all, everything was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Nook for a mini date night after an itch for some Italian food. We were lucky enough to be sat immediately at 6:30p on a Friday night. (the joys of a two top table)

We started the meal with some short rib bruschetta which was absolutely scrumptious. I could've ordered another plate of them and just had that for dinner. When it came to our main course we made the smart choice of sharing a pizza (Porco e funghi) It was very good and had a good amount of cheese to add ons. We couldve gotten dessert but nothing seemed too appetizing to get. 

It definitely has a date ambiance feel. Low overhead lights, candles on each table. The only that killed our date was a woman next to us complaining a bit too loud how the gluten free crust didn't have flavor. In my opinion, if you are looking getting gluten free then you cannot expect the flavor of regular. Also the server corrected how we said bruschetta a couple times. Its rude to correct a customer like that."}
{"text":"I've never been so happy and blown away by service AND food. We originally went down the street to another restaurant and we're ignored so we decided to find the closest pizza place Siri guided us to and I'm glad we ended up here. 
1) greatest within seconds 
2) water was always full 
3) constantly checked on 
4) pizza was the best I've ever had 

This place deserves WAY more than the 5 stars. They go above and beyond and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"comfortable and cozy but high prices for this neighborhood eatery which tries to overachieve. $17 appetizers and Bianco pizza prices and also a charge for the bread is a bit unfriendly. Also if an item is no longer on the small appetizer menu, please announce it at first. Never happy about a restaurant that tries to be classy and mixes it up with football on the screen. Lots of potential and longevity if it tries to cater to the neighborhood.C"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting from out of town for spring training and decided to give this place a shot. We were both blown away by the service and the quality of food. I consider myself a bourbon snob, so the fact that they had selected their own barrel of Knob Creek 120 had me intrigued from the start. 

For food we decided on the braised short rib and the bolognese.... Both were phenomenal and perfectly executed. We are not huge eaters, and we finished both plates. 

Let's talk mixology; Gabe was top notch. I chose for him to construct a drink based on my likes and he knocked it out of the park. 

Dessert - Gooey butter cake.... Enough said. You're missing out if you don't get it 


All in all, Nick, Gabe and the entire staff were dedicated and passionate about their craft and it shows with the quality product that is delivered. 

Well done. We are here for four days and will probably be back. Thank you for the great dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Not the fastest service in the world, they did keep us waiting for a bit on a Wednesday night, but the food more than made up for that.  Excellent pizza and mains for all in our party.  Some fairly unique, but well thought out flavor combinations on the menu.  Good sign when you're having trouble just picking one thing to order!

Poultine was also a nice surprise to see in a restaurant this far south- as good as I remembered it.  House mozzarella is an excellent addition!"}
{"text":"First time here & let me tell you the Poutine was to die for! I didn't look up the menu ahead of time because this was a last minute decision when the first option wasn't open yet. The decor is adorable. I was really happy because Poutine is one of my favorite dishes & they also have Bruschetta! My friend & I shared some appetizers & bruschetta, & it was exactly the right amount. My one little negative comment is the staff wasn't particularly welcoming or warm. Our waiter was efficient but not personable. Seemed like he didn't want to be there. Maybe it was because they had just opened for the evening & we were some of the first guests. No one was rude or bad at their jobs, just felt like it didn't matter if we were there or not."}
{"text":"Amazing!!  Eclectic menu, great ambiance, chic decor, fun & knowledgeable staff. Not to mention a really good pinot noir...on tap!

Two thumbs up for the Arancini (vegetarian risotto balls). We saw the Charcuterie being served to another table and it looked outstanding.  

And you HAVE to try the Affogato for dessert. Lemon ice cream, chocolate crumble and a shot of espresso - delightful!

I'm already planning our next meal there - I am thinking wood-fired pizza....

Nook, we will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for some chow prior to checking out a show next door at the Valley bar.  Its a great little place with a nice upscale vibe to it.  Comfortable seating abound with lots of spots to get a little privacy while on a date or good bar area if you want to mix it up a a bit.  The lighting in this place is exceptional.  Cool wall sconces and hanging chandeliers are very interesting just adding to the upscale feel.  

Everyone is super friendly and the tenders made some great drinks.  They had Tower Station IPA from Mother Road Brewing in Flag which was the first time I've seen that brew make it down to these parts.  Mixed drinks were strong and well mixed.

The food was good but not exceptional.  We had a Charcuterie board which we were a little disappointed in.  Mostly because the cheeses we very average and not very imaginative.  It seems Phoenix is still afraid of softer stinky cheeses that I just go wild for.  The meats on the board however were exceptional.  I think the meat guy needs to talk to the cheese guy!  :)

The rest of the menu was interesting with something for everyone.  We also chose from a variety of Bruchetta and some of them were quite good like the Fig and Goat cheese.

Bathrooms were a bit of a walk out to the connected hotel lobby.  Regardless they were clean and well maintained.  Parking is a bit of a jam but hey you are in DT phoenix so just grab a garage spot and suck it up.  I think we ended up paying $14 for the full night after dinner and show which is not too bad."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place opened in the neighborhood. Nice ambience, good service, and great food. The shrimp bruschetta was amazing, as was the pizza. And the $5 happy hour pinot noir on tap was a great compliment. Our server explained the menu very well and honestly, I could easily try everything on there. The happy hour menu is diverse and cheap; I can't wait to go back and try the arancini and poutine (fries with gravy) for $5!"}
{"text":"Outdoor seating was very pleasant ... Caprese was excellent ... Martini was tasty, but a bit undersized ... Will definitely be back to try it again"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hilton, and didn't want to go out in the heat, so I decided to have a Scotch and eat at the bar. I had the chicken Marsala. I never order this dish, but my wife does and it's usually delicious. Not so for Nook Kitchen. The sauce was too strong. The chicken was tough. The Glenfiddich at the bar was superb, though."}
{"text":"PERFECT.

I feel like I'm pretty hesitant to give a restaurant a 5-star review, but Nook deserves it.

It's a pretty small place, so be sure to call in advance to get a reservation.
We came here on a Monday and it was packed, for good reason.

I tried the Poutine, the Short Rib Bruschetta, and a Pizza.
All were delicious.

Service was excellent.  Fast, friendly, and courteous.  

I would definitely recommend Nook for an amazing, romantic Date Night out.

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Finally!

The long vacant Professional Building in downtown Phoenix has new life. Once the home of Valley National Bank, in the current form this 1932 deco gem houses a Hilton Garden Inn and the subject of this review: Nook.

Whether you are visiting from near or far, Nook is one of the brightest spots downtown. Enter through the Hotel Lobby and you are reminded of a bygone era. One that is rarely seen in the Phoenix landscape. The hotel itself is great, but what Nook did in their corner is modern without losing the classic charm of the space, truly an exercise in class. 

We were pressed for time, with a show at the Herberger. Our server Corey, was spot on. Once he knew our challenge, he helped us quickly (and under the happy hour wire!) choose items from the drink, bruschetta and pizza menus. He was efficient, friendly and quick to make sure Mom was taken care of first and foremost. (Dear Manager, he was GREAT).

Our choices: 
*disclaimer, I referred to the menu to provide the ingredients.  :)

Fig jam, prosciutto, goat cheese and asparagus bruschetta. This was my personal favorite. The salty meat and sweet fig were a great pair. The addition of the asparagus and goat cheese kept the other tasty bits from overpowering and boring the pallet.
 
Short rib bruschetta (with mushroom duxelle, malbec demi-reduction and cotija cheese...) was another table favorite. Before heading to Nook, I read a couple reviews and one mentioned how great this was, we were not disappointed.  

Our pizza was a bianco with prosciutto. Mozzerella, parmesan, olive oil and arugula. The crust was light and entirely edible... Literally to the the crust, which in my case is often left on the plate. 

Though we were on a short time window, the close proximity to the theatre afforded us one more indulgence... 

Affogato. This incarnation has a chocolate pudding with chocolate crumbles, lemon gelato and is of course topped with espresso. In our case, the manager delivered it to the table, exclaiming \"affogato!\" as he drowned the sweets in espresso. Well played Signore!

All were exceptional choices. I can hardly wait to try everything else!

While I hate to reveal this secret, I want it to become a downtown staple... So join me, in enjoying Nook."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. Everything was delicious, great service. The only thing was we got lost trying to find it lol. it's inside a hotel. so go inside the lobby and the entrance is to the left."}
{"text":"Food Quality--5 stars
Pricing/HH Options---3 stars



Well, this place was a very welcome surprise!  Nook has been on my list of \"must try' places and I finally got there to try it last night.  We got there about 4:30 to take advantage of HH specials and got seated immediately in a cute little alcove just off the entrance.  We sat in some really comfy little club chairs and my dining buddy was in heaven because we had arms on them!  I was in heaven because the place smelled so darned good :).  

We had several things recommended to us but there were a couple of special items that caught our eye at the same time: poutine and arancini.  We ordered those and had some lovely beverages while we waited.  DB had some wine and it was pronounced delicious.  I was more in the mood for something fruity and cool, so got a grapefruit/vodka concoction that was really yummy.  

The arancini was the best I've ever had...I've only had it 3 times so am by no means any expert.  The sauce and consistency was really nice and we scarfed them up in no time.   The poutine was the star of the show though; again I'm no expert but was just amazed by the gravy and fries(double fried makes a difference!!!).  The addition of a fried egg was sheer genius!..

We noshed leisurely and had a couple more beverages AND dessert!  Tracy Dempsey bread pudding!!!  I love it but don't have it very often---it was heavenly and worth the calories.  We also got to meet the chef and he was very sharp, sharing some of his future ideas with us.  

So, how to get the coveted 5th star?  

A better array of selections for HH would be great.  My drinks were pricey so I can't come as often as I'd like.  Maybe a drink special of the week?  I loved the HH specials we had but there weren't as many selections as I'd like to see.  With a chef of this caliber, maybe testing some things out as appetizers would be great.

Try different spins on the poutine.  THAT is your moneymaker!!!  A breakfast poutine, a southern poutine, a hatch chili poutine, it's ALL good.  (This will move you away from strictly Italian inspired, into the Comfort food category which opens a lot of new doors).

Think about adding to the salad selections (perhaps a salad pizza?).  The selections seem kind of pedestrian and new creations will really help business during the summer.

Speaking of pizza, BREAKFAST pizza would be a winner,  Egg, gravy, sausage.  Oh, yeah!

When we left, I was drunk on great food and delicious grapefruit beverages.  When the bill came, I paid and left a good tip.  I am still thinking about you, Nook, and plan to come back!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed by this place. DEFINITELY call ahead if you have any hope of eating dinner. My boyfriend and I stopped in for an early dinner on Sunday before he went out of town for a few weeks. When we got there the hostess gave us a 15-20 minute wait time since we hadn't called ahead. The wait list was a jumble of names scribbled at the bottom of a piece of paper so I was a little confused but we were the only ones standing around so I didn't give it too much thought. We loitered in the shopping center for a while talking. 20 minutes turned to 30 turned to 40 and the hostess assured us it would be just a few more minutes since we were next. Another 15 minutes later it would only be another few minutes. We finally gave up after wasting nearly an hour and went somewhere we could actually eat in a reasonable amount of time. The food looked great in pictures but if the rest of the restaurant is as disorganized as the hostess maybe it's a good thing we never got to actually sit down."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a nice New Year's Eve dinner and it was FANTASTIC! We had reservations for 8:15pm (all that was available when I looked the day before) and we were seated promptly. We had a bottle of wine and started with two appetizers, the artichoke and the arincini (sp?). Both were delicious! Our server was very attentive but not pushy which was appreciated since we told him when we sat down that we intended to take our time and enjoy.  We moved onto to dinner with another bottle of wine he recommended (so good!) and had the lamb shank (gigantic!) and the scallops. Both were very good and the butter cake for dessert topped it off perfectly! I'd love to go back!"}
{"text":"Get the Giardino pizza! Loved this trendy spot for some finger lickin' good pie and great wine as well!"}
{"text":"First time here and it's solid. Great location and laid back atmosphere. I had the Diavolo pizza and it was super legit. Upper echelon of pizza with Pomo and Bianco. Looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu outside of the pizza."}
{"text":"Great food and a good location! Located in the Hilton Garden Inn downtown, this Nook is close to the light rail and downtown events. A great bar in the middle serves creative drinks and good wines. Really pretty decor. The food is excellent--you must get the risotto balls! Pizza, salad, apps... it's all delicious!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot to eat dinner at when visiting my friends in downtown Phoenix.  Great vibes, upbeat and fun.  Food is really good! Would recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"One word: poutine. Get it with a fried egg-the yolk and gravy make magic together.  During HH, it's only $5 and you get your money's worth! 
Nook is a super friendly neighborhood joint worth investigating at least once if you live in the area. Frank, the owner, was around several times to make sure our food and service was up to his level (and to recommend the egg on the poutine, which I'm glad he did!) The pizzas are yummy but not entirely original. With the advent of so many gourmet pizza restaurants these days, I fear the lack of invention of Nook will doom it, as it has many restaurants before it. My message to Frank: your food is solid, beer selection great (yea Anchor Steam!), prices are good, ambiance is lovely-Just give me some innovation to be excited about! Also, the poutine is a knock out. Thanks for the egg ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome menu!  Had the sparkling Moscato for my wine, the hummus bruschetta for an appetizer and chicken chop salad for the main course with a nookerdoodle tart for desert.   Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.  :)"}
{"text":"We had a client appreciation party here, and it was perfect! The wine was amazing, the food divine, and the staff so attentive. It could not have been better. The events coordinator, Erica, planned a perfect party, and Cory was a knowledgeable, attentive host. Our other server (who looks like the princess of Monaco) was also appreciated.  The environment is so fun- perfect for an evening dressed up or dressed down. The espresso rubbed filet and scallops were table favorites. We all had a memorable night. Clients could not believe that such a genuine gem of a restaurant was located in a hotel!"}
{"text":"Nook is like a fancier version of a sports bar. For the kind and quality of the food, and the overall much more casual experience than we expected, the price point seems a little high.The food is good (particularly the short ribs, but the salmon was dry, the swordfish lacked flavor, and sometimes the presentation was quite lacking), the service is excellent, and overall I think its a 3.5 star experience (I'll round up to 4 for Yelps sake). 

It feels cosy and casual, even though it is pretty dimly lit, largely because of the TVs right next to the booth seating area. That's probably why it feels more like a sports bar than an intimate restaurant. Most of the other diners seem to be in their 30s-50s and the atmosphere was pretty relaxed. Let's just say there are a lot of tattoos and piercings in the room, which is totally fine with me but did not sit well with some of older, more traditional professionals I came here with. It feels more like a cool place to come with friends, than a place to have a fancy dinner with colleagues or family."}
{"text":"Sat there for 10 minutes and not a single server came. Not even for water.
*Owner did reach out and was very apologetic and offered to make it right.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service!  Very quaint and cozy.  Highly recommend for locals and visitors alike!"}
{"text":"Nook saved my husband and I one evening where we attended a party where neither of us could eat more than tortilla chips due to our dietary restrictions (me-veg, him- no dairy, no gluten). 

Nook had been on my bookmarks list for awhile for the gluten free pizza, but my husband wasn't down with eating a cheeseless pizza so he went for the short ribs instead. He absolutely loved them! He raved about them with every bite, and he was equally happy with the sides. My pizza was just ok. It reminded me of pizza that I can make at home, and I was hoping for something with a little more wow.

What was more impressive was the cocktails. Not a long list, but the two we got were both very good. Service was impeccable. Both the manager and our waiter really made us feel welcome and at home. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood place we can walk or drive to. Friendly service! Everything about this place is wonderful. I feel like family whenever I'm here."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! Staff super nice!! I came into town for a training and went with a friend. Atmosphere was relaxed and I think the owner made rounds to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Highly recommend this place and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just called to placed an order because I didn't have time to eat at the restaurant. I arrived at the time they told me. took her 15 min to go and swipe my card, not just that but after $17 personal pizza you would expect at least some napkins, maybe a bag or something!? to top it all off I work across the street... my pizza was cold. really annoyed. Last time I was there the busser was helping us because the waiter was no where to be found. Ok food, Mediocre service. when visiting plan ahead to waste time."}
{"text":"It was good. Food was delicious and my husband and I had a nice date night there. Expensive, but you pay for it. The drinks had beautiful presentation and my salmon had the perfect crispy skin. My husband loved his steak."}
{"text":"Some friends & I went for the first time a couple weeks ago. Our waitress was super friendly & very helpful with the menu. We happened to go on a Sunday when you can get 1/2 price bottles of wine (which is awesome for a group of people). The scallops were amazing & so we're the pizzas! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my boyfriend this past Friday night for dinner. First impression...it's a small restaurant with a cool, hip ambience...a good place for a date or a small group. For drinks we ordered the rosemary baby & cilantro mule. Both cocktails were delicious, interesting & creative. As for food, we ordered the vongole (a white pizza with bacon & clams) and the chicken Marsala (with a grand marnier reduction).  Food was phenomenal & flavors were on point.  Service & staff were excellent & attentive. Met with the owner Taygen, very friendly & cool & checked up on us few times to ensure we were happy with everything. Definitely would come back again to try their other unique dishes."}
{"text":"Saw this place on yelp and decided to try something new. So glad I did! Loved this place! It wasn't a big restaurant. It was small and cozy but modern. We were greeted and seated right away. Our server, Ralph, came to our table a couple minutes later with water. He explained the menu and we decided on the risotto balls, pork butt bruschetta and chicken Marsala. Everything was AMAZING! I am not a big fan of chicken Marsala but this one made me want to lick the plate clean. Yes, it was that good! Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing wonderful my family and I went to dinner here last night .... the service was good and the food was wonderful. We started with the caprese  bruschetta, and the ricotta cheese balls with a balsamic reduction can u say explosion of flavor in your mouth.. I had the cowboy ribeye so tender and so much flavor .... my sister had the chicken marsala she couldn't stop taking about how great it was (I stole a bit of hers and it was fantastic) .... the hubby had the shrimp pasta and it was also wonderful ...... highly recommend this restaurant !!!"}
{"text":"The salad pizza and appetizers were really good love the atmosphere and Allie our server was really friendly."}
{"text":"Blown away by the service from all the staff as well as the overall experience at the restaurant. The food was amazing as well. Make sure to try the bread pudding!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Saturday evening with 4 kids and 4 adults. Food was very good and service was great. Pizzas were excellent, good for sharing at a great price. I had a huge spinach salad that I really enjoyed. My husband had chicken Marsala that he liked. I would not suggest this place for kids/families. There is no designated kids menu and the pepperoni pizza was super spicy (which I loved but the kids, not so much).  I would suggest going with adults for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago with my dad during a spring training trip and I tried the pork chops. My dad tried the pizza and both were very delicious and well priced. The staff was very friendly and the food was fresh. The location was great and I definitely will go back the next time I'm in Arizona. 10/10 would recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"Great food! Poutine and Porco e Fungi pizza. Perfect crust! Soft but crunchy! Perfectly cooked! A little froo froo yuppy for my taste, but I can overlook that for the good food."}
{"text":"Fantastic everything. Food is unique.   Like you've never had.   But in a good way.   Love the attitude of everyone there."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! I passed by it recently while in downtown and was so glad when I made it back that it was as cool as it looked from the outside.  Great food, drinks and happy hour specials.  Really excellent staff too.  I'll definitely be back! Thanks for making my friend's bday celebration a great one. :)"}
{"text":"Had a one night layover in Phoenix with my girlfriend on the way to Mexico, and I had a feeling we should spent that night looking for some good food. A quick browse around Yelp revealed this place to me, and I figured I'd go for it. Sending the owner Frank an email asking about reservations yielded positive results, and so when we had settled in to the hotel, we went to Nook. 

I'm pretty happy we did. The restaurant is laid out differently than most, going for depth rather than width. The bar was perpendicular to the entrance, and there were booths all the way down following the wall opposite the bar. We sat in one of these booths, and our waiter attended to us immediately. He was very pleasant, and attentive, offering a few personal anecdotes here and there as the night went by and he passed us or cleared our table. We started with the Arancini and if you'd pardon my language, it was effing amazing. Just... amazing. I opted for a glass of white wine to go with dinner, and the girlfriend had a nice cocktail. 

The entree was pizza and it was superb. The menu is concise but effective. We shared everything and it was awesome. The mood in Nook is definitely classy without feeling uptight. Laid back and stylish. People sitting in the bar seemed like people who knew the place intimately and it gave a familiar ambiance. Like you're just down on the corner from home. I liked it a lot. 

We finished with an Affogato. It was, as expected, really good. 

This place tickled my fancy in a big way. If I'm ever through Phoenix again, I'd have to fight myself hard not to go here again. Perhaps I would end up forgoing trying new things just because I want Frank and his crew to make my night once more."}
{"text":"Great find! It has been long since we've had such great service combined with great food at an eating establishment. We asked the cameriere if they could make a sangria (not on the menu) and he didn't only say yes, he noted that the bar tender was a Level 2 Sommelier and went on to explain exactly what ingredients he would use to make my wife's sangria. 
We ordered the Charcuterie and the Giardano Pizza... The Charcuterie may as well be an entrée for two, and again the cameriere went on to explain each and every ingredient on it with \"gusto\"! Delicious to the last bite ( we ended up dumping some of the soprassetta and Hungarian salami onto the pizza.
We could only manage to eat a slice of the pizza (since we were already stuffed with all the meats, cheeses, fruits, sauces, bread, etc) from our \"appetizer\", and it beat our expectations. You could taste every ingredient (tomato, basil, fungi, spinach, olive oil, fresh mozzarella...) and they were really fresh and flavorful...
If you haven't yet tried NOOK... Hurry up and do!"}
{"text":"Two hints about coming here: it's in a hotel and the hotel valet parking is pretty expensive at $16.  You can get it validated and get $5 but that's still pretty spendy.    

The interior of this restaurant is adorable and filled with eclectic things that somehow perfectly go together.  Clearly, much thought has gone into drinks as they are complex and interesting.  Food was fantastic as well.  Pizza is delish but several other items caught my eye too so a return trip is in order.  The dessert menu featured Gooey Butter Cake that we fully intended to order but were too full at the end.  Gooey Butter Cake is a St. Louis staple and it's always neat to see it outside of Missouri. 

Our server was a doll and super attentive about dealing with everyone's allergies and food sensitivities.  She saw that the kitchen had mistakenly put nuts in a dish before we did - excellent catch!"}
{"text":"The concept of the food is good, but the ingredients weren't high enough quality to justify the price. The service was awesome, especially for how large of a party we had."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. Staff is very friendly and attentive. I would suggest any of their pizzas. We also tried the chicken Marsala and short ribs and those dishes did not disappoint. Make sure to also try the poutine w/ fried egg! Very yummy! I also have to mention that they have Kronenbourg on tap :) this place is definitely on our rotation list and happy to have this gem in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Inside of the Hilton Garden Inn (which has an amazing lobby) sits a hotel restaurant that is one of the best I've had. Service was good (3.5 stars), the ambiance great (4 stars), but it was the food that stole the show, well the pizza anyways (5 stars). We got a white sauced pie with sausage and caramelized onions. The crust was perfect, thin enough to have some crunch but still thick enough to have substance. This would be a five star review but the Italian sandwich was soggy (the bread is flat bread and hadn't been fired properly). We sent it back and weren't charged."}
{"text":"Another lovely night at Nook.  Our server, Ralph made the evening a delight.  Relaxed environment, yummy, yummy food, great drinks on offer, not to mention fabulous company.  Love to have this place in our neighborhood.  Been coming since Nook opened and the staff welcome us like friends every time!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant and was one of the highlights of my trip to Phoenix. They were able to accommodate our group of eight. The waiter was fantastic and offered great suggestions. The food was absolutely amazing. Everyone in my group could not stop talking about their delicious meals. I highly recommend Nook Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood. You would think we have enough great pizza places to choose from in 85018 but these guys kick it up a notch by adding spice an a unique and yummy crust. Great service and atmosphere. Caprese bruschetta amazing! Great neighborhood place!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and pasta crepe. Yes, a pasta crepe. Service was all around exceptional. Strip mall location was a bit odd but if that's their biggest problem they'll be fine. Atmosphere inside was nice."}
{"text":"Cozy little place in an unassuming strip joint with some equally good culinary neighbors. It's new with the typical Phoenician menu of salads, pizzas, beers (what's up with that in Phoenix??), but they also have some unique items as well.  Definitely worth a try in your restaurant line up."}
{"text":"Our dinner club, 20 people, visited this place on a Saturday night.  Located in heart of downtown.  The menu was not limited but rather varied, all of us found something that sounded good. My wife had Chicken Marsala and I had the Rib Eye.  Both were very tasty and cooked exactly how we ordered.  Not one complaint from the other 18 people on the food or how it was served. The staff was on top of it and was very proficient.  They prepped us that the food would come out when finished and not how ordered.  This ensured every meal was hot and fresh.  While I thought the alcohol was a bit pricey ($11 for Moscow Mule), they did not cut a corner on amount of the pour.  I had the ooey gooey butter cream for dessert and my wife had the chocolate mouse cake.  Both where excellent and not mis proportioned.  The only complaint, if you want to call it a complaint, was the waiter was not very personable.  Professional, courteous and well organized, but just didn't interact well.  The bartenders were on it and kept drinks flowing as we arrived.  It appeared the manager, not sure because he didn't introduce himself, even came and verified that everything was prepared well and that overall, we were enjoying our selves.  I would recommend this place for a great night out."}
{"text":"Went here with my party of 5 last night and it was awesome!
The items we all ordered were:

Pork chops ... Amazing
Salmon... Amazing (not fishy at all) 
Pizza... Amazing (gluten free available) 
Hummus Plate....Amazing
Waiter... Amazing
Drink prices... Not amazing haha $11 for wine is a little pricey I think.

So, In other words, we will be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Hand-crafted cocktails and a killer happy hour keep me coming back to this place time and time again. Not to mention the rotating drink menu and awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Nook was pretty awesome. I'm excited that it's in my neighborhood, and can't wait to return to try more!

My husband and I came here for dinner last night, because we wanted to try the new neighborhood restaurant, and had heard good things. When we arrived all of the tables were full, so we had a drink at the bar until one became available. The bartender was very helpful with my wine selection, and offered a taste before I committed to my order. Their bar stools are super comfortable (they were more like padded chairs on stilts) so much that we almost just stayed there to eat our dinner, but decided to wait for a table instead. I can see myself in the future hanging out here just for drinks and watching the pizzas being made at the end of the bar, as the ambiance is very relaxing and they were playing awesome music. 

We were seated at one of the spacious rounded booths, which was also very comfortable. Our server Kaylita was awesome, very nice, and totally on point throughout our dinner. For food we decided on the deconstructed Asian salad with Salmon cooked medium and the florentine pizza. The salad came out first, the salmon was cooked perfectly and was seasoned very well, the Asian veggies were crunchy and fresh and the ginger rice was very good with subtle flavor. Our pizza was very good too, the ricotta was very and creamy, you could tell they used quality ingredients, the roasted tomatoes were marinated and not mushy, and the crusty was perfect. My only complaint was that the pizza was a little too oily. 

After my great experience, I will definitely be adding Nook into my neighborhood rotation whether it's for happy hour at the bar, or for dinner."}
{"text":"Great food and environment.  People were supper friendly and responsive. Great happy hour too. Chopped salad is awesome and the Calabrese pizza is great. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Easy 5 stars. The place was awesome....great cocktails, great service, great food - what more can you need!! I had a rhubarb and rye that was epic...followed by bruschetta and then a solid filet. Really really enjoyed dinner! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Amazing food! But most of all Fabulous service!
We love Grea the server!! She was flawless!!
We will be back!"}
{"text":"I keep asking can I swear on Yelp?  We were on spring break in Scottsdale this past week and happened upon this place by accident, and what a great accident it was.  It's kind of kitschy and hipstery but a way cool vibe all around, custom cocktails with a seasonal menu.  While I enjoyed my pizza (great crust) it was my girls filets that stole the show...coming from a beef town (Chicago) their filets were some of the best steaks I've ever eaten...the giant fries and that cheesy red bell pepper shmear was to die for...they were cutting the meat with their forks for fu**s sake!

Go here now...I only wish I lived here so I could come back to try everything else on the menu.

5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"If you are going to sell a meat platter, at least include enough bread to eat with it!"}
{"text":"I came to Nook for Happy Hour with a girlfriend yesterday and absolutely LOVED it! Their prices are fabulous, wine is delicious and the food, oh myyyy goodness, no words. 

We ordered the Arancini rice balls {AKA cheesy balls of heaven} and the Fig Bruschetta {w/prosciutto, goat cheese & asparagus}. The portions were perfect for 2 and great service, as always! I will be back VERY soon! 

Here is their HH menu: http://nookkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nook-Kitchen-HH.pdf"}
{"text":"Spend your money elsewhere at least if you look like me. This is going to sound really whiny but it's based on my experience at this restaurant. Was in town for work and some colleagues recommended the place. I went in, sat at the bar. Terrible service. Seemed like everybody I walked in with got a menu except me. Asked for a menu, got it but literally nobody asked for my order. Finally got the bar tender's attention. Got a drink but no refill requests. No one asked to take my dinner order. I figured I was going to spend my money else where. Went to the restaurant at the Westin. Should have just gone there. Loved the food and service."}
{"text":"My best friend and her boyfriend met me for dinner Saturday night ... because I am their favorite third wheel. Her boyfriend has even given me a rare \"I will punch anyone in the face for you once\" card. Like if I need it, no questions asked, he will punch you in the face for me. We might have been drunk when this card was offered. 

Luckily, there was no need for summoning up that card at dinner, because it was delicious. And that's hard to do considering I made a bunch of sad changes to my salad in order to be healthy. I was like no this, no that, no fun, don't hate me. The server was very kind and what was left of my salad was fresh and delicious. Meanwhile, the lovebirds sitting next to me ate pizza. F*ck those guys. 

(I'm totally coming back for the pizza.)"}
{"text":"Holy mac n' cheese balls. This place is a gem! I've been here multiple times and never had a bad thing on the menu. My go-to is a glass of red wine or rose and a few pieces of pizza. The pizza isn't too light or dense and perfect for those nights that lead into bar-hopping around Arcadia. 

The mac and cheese balls are a great appetizer to share. The marinara sauce is what makes these to die for. My eyes roll back in my head when I eat these. I'd gladly surrender my scale and only eat these for the rest of my life. 

Be warned that your bill can creep up quickly. You get what you pay for, but if we are here not on happy hour we end up spending an arm and a leg for a few drinks and pizza. It's definitely not a casual date night spot but rather a once-in-a-while kind of place. 

TIP: Do not sit by the pizza oven at the bar. It's not worth it, you'll leave drenched in sweat. Common sense would have told us to sit elsewhere but the food is just too good to wait for!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for desert w Marisa and had a great margarita and terrific bread pudding which was served with really delicious macerated fruit.  Neat place, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had such a wonderful dinner at Nook Kitchen. We went on a Sunday evening and the hostess had informed us that they had been short staffed. We decided to stay and give this place a try and we are so glad we did! The atmosphere is great! We started off with some drinks from the bar, all of which were delicious! Our table ordered several starters and bruschetta instead of entrees. We enjoyed everything we ordered! The food was presented wonderfully and tasted even better. Not to mention, the staff was SO attentive!! We had never noticed that they were short staffed because they did a great job at making us feel like we were important to each person that came by our table. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. Once they found out it was my daughters birthday they all made sure to say happy birthday to her also  We will definitely be returning to Nook Kitchen once we're back in town!!"}
{"text":"We came here for an event, so I didn't exactly get the regular restaurant treatment. It was a work party, so we had our own little reserved area.

Service was top notch. The waitress was super friendly and always attentive. I never had an empty water glass, and she always made sure we had whatever we needed.

The food was also awesome. We had a set menu because of it being a reserved party, but that was fine with me because they had options available for me that I knew I would like.

The olives were delicious. I didn't think I'd like them because they were warmed up, but they were actually pretty good. I also had the espresso rubbed filet which was magical. So good and cooked just like I had asked. The Grand Marnier dragon carrots were excellent. The fingerling potatoes were great. That white truffle cream sauce was boss.

I'd definitely come back here if I was staying in the area again."}
{"text":"Good selection for a bar atmosphere but higher priced. Bruschetta tasty but a bit on the flat side. Staff very helpful, knowledgeable and attentive.decor rustic and comfortable. Pizza good and hot with great tasting crust.  Drink menu was fun but we didn't drink. Cocktails and wine a bit high priced but beers are at $7. We'd come back."}
{"text":"Started with drinks! The mule was light and refreshing. We came for the charcuterie board and were not disappointed! The meat arrangement was diverse and unexpected. Next We shared the chopped salad. The blue cheese melted in your mouth with the warm grilled chicken. We wanted to try a pizza and were thrilled with the porco e funghi, the crispy thin crust was the best part! 
We will absolutely be back to this little gem! U"}
{"text":"I've been to Nook's popular flagship in Arcadia and remembered the experience with relative fondness, but its been awhile.  It was quite a coup for the new Downtown Phoenix Hilton Garden Inn to get a restaurant as popular as Nook as their marquee restaurant.  Curious to see how it stacked up against their original location, I decided to treat my Mom to a meal here on a hot summer Wednesday evening.

The Downtown location is much larger than the original with probably about three times as much indoor seating as well as patio seating (not in use during a 110 degree day of course, but still).  The interior does bare a pretty decent resemblance to the Arcadia location, albeit with a decidedly more urban flare.  You have to walk through the lobby of the hotel to get there, just FYI.  Also, I strongly recommend walking or biking here as parking is expensive.  It's valet parking only and costs $12 (and that's after validation).  One other thing a few Yelpers have accurately pointed out is that while the menu here is almost identical to the Arcadia location, the Downtown location's prices are noticeably higher.  Maybe the rent is way more expensive here?  On average it seems like most of the items are about $4-$5 more expensive at the Downtown location.  Just a few things to keep in mind.

Alright the food.  I'll just go into what I had.  We split an order of the Arancini to start off.  Seven fried balls of risotto and mozzarella cheese with a tomato puree and balsamic reduction.  A delicious start to be sure.  For my entree, I went with the Bolognese.  A hearty beef and pork pasta covered with copious amounts of a ground sausage and tomato sauce.  This will fill most stomachs all by itself and I really want to package that sauce for future use.  For dessert,  I grabbed a slice of the Ooey Gooey Butter Cake.  Basically a slice of super soft cheese cake topped with cream and a blueberry compote.  They hit all the right notes with this one and I really liked the texture of the crust.  

Total price for my half of the Arancini, the Bolognese, the Ooey Gooey Butter Cake, tax and tip came to about $70.  If you're looking for a cheaper experience, my advice would be to come during happy hour and work the happy hour menu tapas style.  And again, arrive via bike or on foot (or even via light rail) if possible and save your car from the expensive valet.  So I'll say 3.5 stars for my first time here.  The prices are a little steep both in the restaurant and getting a parking spot, but the food at Nook is reliably solid and worth the trouble.  I'd probably still recommend the Arcadia location as a first option if you're on a tight budget, but the Downtown location is a welcome addition to the continuing Downtown culinary renaissance."}
{"text":"If you're ready for THEE best lunch in dwtn Phoenix, stop in at the Nook at the Hilton Garden Inn, across the street from Chase Bank.

Owner/Manager Erica is on-site and guarantees a LOVELY experience.

Their Tuna on Flatbread with a side salad and Ice Tea gets the job done.

DO NOT MISS the NOOK for lunch or dinner. 

FINE dining comes to dwtn Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great experience. Located in a strip shopping center, the vibe inside is hip, fun and inviting. The staff was AMAZING; from the owner who greeted us at the door, to the bartender who said hello as we passed by the bar, to our great server.

Really nice wine list with reasonable prices for bottles and glasses. Have a fun selection of hand crafted house cocktails. 

Pizza was outstanding with a great bubbly crust and house-made mozzarella. Fresh toppings and a nice tomato sauce made for a perfect combo. Chicken Marsala was outstanding. And try the arrancini  rice ball apps - very yummy.

Even if the food wasnt as excellent as it was, I'd go back because the staff was so damn nice. Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Hubby had delicious hand crafted mule in an actual copper cup (always better than glass).  Wine was great and cold. Started with the grilled artichoke.  Tender all the way down to the stem and perfectly seasoned.  Expresso rubbed steak with fingerling potatoes was tender and flavorful. Hubby had spicy pasta with scallops.  Perfect amount of heat and flavor combination.  The best part of the whole experience was the hands-on service and attention given by the two owner/ manager/ bartender.  Finally someone who gets that true customer service and great dining experiences do not rely on one role per person.  It was great to see them greet patrons, help in the bar, accurately and passionately describe the well thought out menu and constantly looking to see what needs to be done next.  Not to mention wonderful personalities!!! We will be back."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Nook! Came in to try the pizza. We Ordered the Mela e Dattero plus sausage. Oh and half-price bottles of wine happy hour or even on Sunday, yes please! Nice thin crispy crust, but was also somewhat dry and too crunchy. The ingredients were slightly flavorful, some sweetness with the fruit paired up with saltiness from the sausage. Definitely not pizza I would return for unfortunately, but the ambiance and setting I would. Better then the pizza was our server, Ale! She was very helpful, very friendly, informative, and checked in with us at appropriate times. Very cozy spot woth an intimate feel."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful, cozy place.  My hubby and I have been there a few times now.  All visits have been great.  The last one, we invited one of our friends who lives in the neighborhood to join us.  He was so pleased.  We started at happy hour, their HH deals are great.  I had the arancini, so delicious.  The risotto balls filled with mozzarella and then deep fried and with a reduction of balsamic on the plate, what is not to like.  Creamy inside and crunchy outside, did I mentioned they are deep fried?  We also had the Short Rib Bruschetta and the arugula salad.  Our friend arrived after HH so he ordered a salad that is not on the menu anymore :(, it was a deconstructed salad with salmon.  My hubby also had a pizza.  I wouldn't go there for pizza, since there are so many other places that do just pizza, but the rest of the items are amazing and don't miss the bread and butter bread pudding.  It is AMAZING.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great spot in a beautiful atmosphere for a drink or meal.
I had the lamb shank which wasn't the best I ever had but certainly was satisfying."}
{"text":"The chicken Marsala will make u stand on street corner begging for loose change it is damn fresh and  delicious by far the best item to me. Teagan the owner is super friendly and also very easy one the eyes. A MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Gf and I just flew into Phoenix and Nook Kitchen is where we chose to eat. Was excited to have the olives but they were out! That wasn't a good start plus our server was not helpful when it came to the menu. Had the chicken Marsala and it was ok. Glazed sauce was great!"}
{"text":"Just flew in with my gf and we chose to eat here. Disappointed from the get go because they were out of olives! Plus, the server was not helpful with the menu. I had the Chicken Marsala and it was cooked well but the Grand marnier sauce was a little too sweet but overall ok. I wouldn't eat here again if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Amazing that this place is inside a Hilton Garden Inn. Much more high end than I expected. Fresh pizzas, bruscettas and great entrees. 
Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"The crust is a must! Don't trust a skinny cook! Nook took a cook and made a kitchen. It's clean,friendly and reasonably priced. Highly recommended for hungry people!"}
{"text":"Loved the margherita pizza & arugula salad was great! Can't wait to get back & eat through the menu."}
{"text":"Pizza Giardino was so good.  My rhubarb  & rye cocktail was excellent.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  Met the owner and he made us feel welcome.  Brittany, our server, A+.  We shall be back very soon."}
{"text":"I decided to try something new, and discovered The Nook. Though it's located in a old looking plaza, it's interior design inside  is quite nice. 

I managed to get in right before happy hour ended, and ordered the beer braised pork butt bruschetta and the vongle pizza.

The pork bruschetta smelled and tasted so amazing, I was definitely left wanting more. The vongle pizza was good, but it could have been better. The center of the pizza was limp, and the pizza was barely above warm.

I would definitely come back to have the bruschetta again, and possibly a pasta dish."}
{"text":"Really cool little restaurant with a great vibe. Amazing wine list by a world class sommelier. 
Every food item is thoughtfully planned prepared. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We will go back... I was disappointed in their Halibut tacos and when asked said I wouldn't order them again.  But.. I can't have dairy so the sauce was not included to accommodate my request.  The sauce was where the seasoning and flavor was.  
They took my order off the bill and offered a free desert which my husband could only have ( he loved there pumpkin spice cake)
It's nice to go to a resteraunt where the staff actually cares about the customers. 
Love them!"}
{"text":"I came here last night for a birthday dinner and I must say I was thoroughly impressed. I have been the location downtown and the menus are completely different. I had a mule to start off with for a drink and it was unique. Not like any regular mule i've ever had. We had the arancini and traditional caprese to start off with. For dinner I got the linguine salmon. At first I thought it was going to be a weird concept but after trying it, I loved it. Someone else at the table for a pepperoni pizza which they ate the entire thing, a salad, and the chicken marsala which I also really enjoyed. The place was really cute and dark. The service was decent and I was able to watch the game at the bar. Overall, I really enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"We were heading to PoeFest and decided to stop in here for our preshow dinner. The food was very high quality and the service was excellent. My only \"complaint\" would be that their water tasted HORRIBLE!  Even the ice tea flavor diminished as the ice melted. Other than that... it was great. Next time I might bring a bottle of my own water."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the Calabrese pizza and mixed green salad with lemon vinegarette. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Nook is a small, upscale restaurant that offers salads, a range of Western entrees, and pizza. Vegetarian options are marked, and there are quite a few of them. The word hangry was written artfully on a chalkboard near my booth, with its dictionary definition chalked below. I imagine most people that come to Nook don't leave hangry; I certainly didn't.
 
My colleagues and I were fifteen minutes late to our reservation, but were seated quickly: first at the bar to wait for our booth, and then at the booth. 1/3 of the restaurant is table seating, 1/3 is bar seating, and 1/3 is booth seating; it's not a particularly large space. I'm fully committed to the \"eat every carbohydrate that your health-conscious peers shy away from\" diet in 2016: I ordered arancini, the caprese bruschetta, and the funghi pizza.
 
If you're like me and afraid of pronouncing words on menus, I encourage you to still order the aracini. The fried balls of risotto were delicious. The Nook arancini came playfully arranged: four on marinara and two on balsamic glaze.  The arancini reminded me of a trip I took to San Francisco on Memorial Day weekend in 2015 - I stopped for pizza while traveling with a friend after just having seen the Book of Mormon at the Orpheum. Like that time before, this arancini was memorable. Maybe I'll be saying, \"that time I was in Phoenix for work and wanted somewhere to eat pizza and talk about refrigerators\" in a future review to reference this arancini. 
 
The caprese bruschetta was okay. The balsamic glaze was too viscous, and the tomatoes were a bit ho-hum.
 
The pizza was phenomenal. I'm a sucker for the smell of truffle oil, and the pizza tasted as good as it smelled. I am struggling to find the right words to describe the pizza. The folks that don't like arugula salad on thin crust, white sauce, mushroom pizza should probably not order the funghi pizza. But for me, this was the best pizza I had had in, call it, at least six months. Chopped judge Amanda Freitag calls pizza her deserted island food, a food that she could sustain herself with ad infinitum. I'm not quite at that level yet, but: This. Pizza. Hit. The. Spot. It's the kind of pizza I sheepishly ate as quickly as I could so I didn't have to share it with others. Sorry, friends.
 
The service was highly attentive. Nook is the kind of restaurant that gives you clean plates between appetizers and entrees, and replaces your fork instead of asking you if you want to keep it. Our server did forget to place my colleague's salmon order. Upon realizing it, he was more repentant than Peter after denying Christ the 3rd time. Sure, our server didn't go about weeping bitterly, but he offered a free dessert.
 
I would return if I were in Scottsdale. I had heard good things about Nook, and am happy to confirm that they were true."}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome and fresh food. Only downside was the bartender sat around with his friends and ate with them then came back to work the bar without washing his hands. 
Our waiter however was pleasant and very patient with my husbands never ending questions. Wait time on food was not bad."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We are from out of town and stopped in on Friday evening before going to a basketball game. They have a happy hour from 4-6 that includes drink specials ($5 titos vodka drinks which are normally $9! Also beer and wine deals) and $3 off pizzas, bruschettas, salads, starters. We sat at the bar and had awesome service from the guy bartender (we forgot to catch his name!). The manager also chatted with us. For food we had the porco y fungi pizza and it was SO good! Thin crispy crust and simple, fresh toppings  = our favorite kind of pizza. 

We had such a good experience we actually went again on Saturday evening after having sub par service at a different restaurant. Had a few drinks and tried the fig jam bruschetta - fig jam, goat cheese, asparagus - unique and delicious! The same bartender and the manager were there and remembered us. Awesome food, drinks, and service plus good happy hour deals - I'd definitely recommend Nook!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation on Friday night for a date night dinner and had a great experience!  The staff was great - super friendly and welcoming.  The restaurant and bar area are nicely appointed and very comfortable.  The food was fantastic too - we started with the arancini and meatballs as our appetizers (great choices) and I enjoyed the salmon entree with cauliflower mash and squash with chili oil - so tasty!  The dessert menu sounded amazing, but we were anxious to close out and go to the speakeasy next door for a nightcap.  We'll definitely be back again soon...maybe for cocktails and dessert at the bar next time!"}
{"text":"Such a great place!  Great vibe to the restaurant, great service and super tasty food.  We split the arancini as our starter and I enjoyed the pasta crepe for my entree.  The pasta crepe was huge, so be prepared to take some home.  My husband and our friend both enjoyed two different pizzas and they both were very pleased with their selections.  Nook is definitely a great addition to the Arcadia neighborhood.  Love that this place provides a casual, reasonably priced option for a night out with high quality food."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was going to take a photo but we were all too interested in eating versus Instagramming. What a great local spot. We found this place after a recommendation from Undertow. We were looking for good, substantial food worthy of a birthday. We definitely found it. Super friendly staff, great pizza and salad- the perfect antidote to many tiki drinks.  I highly recommend. You won't be disappointed! 
Table ordered: simple side salads, easily dressed but attentional to detail was nice. Divola pizza was INSANE. We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Well Nook in Arcadia has been one of my favorite places in Phoenix but this location is on a whole other level of amazing! The attention to detail in the atmosphere is captivating! I appreciate some of the historic hotel elements incorporated into the modern décor. It still maintains the cozy, welcoming Italian home vibe that Nook is all about- \"Come to the table and let's savor an amazing meal and enjoy each others' company\" kinda vibe.  The service is excellent and the food just WOWs you. Chef Nick LaRosa is a culinary genius. 

Do yourself a favor and don't skip dessert: get the Affogato. Yes, even after lunch- I assure you, you'll get more work done!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from Check Please Arizona. Have been dying to try it for some time. Finally got to last night, meeting a friend for dinner. We had just missed happy hour which was a big bummer since it would have been 1/2 price appetizers. Ended up splitting 2 of the brushetta's with my friend - the pork butt and the short ribs. Both were pretty good, but other than a pile of tasty meat on a tiny piece of bread, it was kind of not interesting enough and also a small amount for the price.  We got 2 half orders which cost $8 for just two pieces.  I also tried the fig, prosciutto and goat cheese.  Decided I don't like prosciutto - it was like unchewable cardboard.  The fig jam was tasty but there wasn't enough and there was a tiny drop of goat cheese. Overall a bit disappointing.

My friend convinced me to order dinner which I hesitated on. I don't go to fancy or expensive places with an exception of Hillstones. I eventually ordered a $28 chicken dinner and it was disappointing. The spice rub on it was nice, but the texture of the chicken was rubbery and it wasn't a huge piece. It was a chicken breast with bone attached (yuk) and some bone and cartilage attached on the underside.  If I'm paying $28 bucks - you need to take the crap off my food please!

The mashed potatoes were fine, there were some great crispy sweet peas I really liked and a nice sauce.  In the end, I highly regretted spending that kind of money on a meal of that quality. I paid about $60 total (tax, tip) for a meal that wasn't the best and I was hungry an hour later and had to swing by McDonalds! 

On the pros side - the interior of the restaurant is very nice. Exposed brick and duct work, Edison lights, candle light, comfy, elevated booths. I liked the look of it all and the location was great in central Phoenix. The staff was also very attentive and pleasant.  I just can't get past the so-so ness of the food. 

If I were to go back, I would only do so at happy hour and I would focus on getting the bruschetta's which were nice. Maybe try a lesser priced pizza."}
{"text":"Cute place, a little smaller than you'd expect! Drink menu was good - lots of different wine options. Got the poutine - which was huge - and didn't regret it! Next time we go back I'm trying their desserts!"}
{"text":"It is incredibly rare that I give a 5 star review. Nook deserves it. Why.....

Atmosphere: 9 out of 10. Super casual, comfortable, intimate but not small, cozy, warm, inviting. Not loud, you can actually have a conversation at a normal level and not disturb anyone, but not overhear anyone.

Staff: 10 out of 10. Honestly could not be better. Our bar tender was fantastic. She remembered out names from the moment we met until 3 hours later when we left. She recommended an incredible Mexican chocolate peanut butter milk stout. Sound weird? It was rich and thick and smooth and delicious! Our server was amazing. He was incredibly knowledgeable about each menu dish, how it was made, each ingredient and what made it special, the taste balance, and spice. He made several recommendation and all were spot-on. He was attentive an friendly and relaxed. Other servers were as friendly and approachable and knowledgeable. They also stopped by, said hello, helped out with dish choices. Seriously amazing people.

Food: 10 out of 10. This is a very rare rating for me to give. The food was excellent in every sense. The blend of ingredients, spices and heat were incredible. Tastes were explosions of unique and unusual blends of high-end ingredients. Presentation was outstanding, colorful, modern, creative and beautiful. The quantity was plentiful. \"Beginnings\" were an excellent start, drinks were delicious, dessert was delicious and put us over the top. You will not leave hungry. Value was outstanding. For the quality, quantity, atmosphere and service, Nook cannot be beat.

Overall: I can't wait to go back. The drive from Ahwatukee was well worth twice the time. I am a huge fan of short ribs, wanted to try them, our server made an outstanding recommendation for the fried chicken which is no longer on the menu (hope it comes back) and the scallops. Both were phenomenal. Looking forward to going back soon to try all the other entrees.

Don't miss this comfortable, friendly, casual, delicious, plentiful, high quality place. Their menu changes, so go try what looks good, be amazed, then head back again to try something new and even more delicious. The friendly, attentive staff will always be glad to see you again."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time in downtown Phoenix tonight because the hotel I was staying at didn't have quite the tempting menu with both gluten and gluten free options.  

Upon arrival, I got an immediate seat for 1 at the bar (Tuesday at 7:30 pm). The ambience at the bar, the decor and the restaurant are really nice- all the light fixtures are awesome! It's smaller than I had anticipated (I like that) but found it to be perfectly quaint and cozy. 

James, the bartender, knew how to make a delicious slightly dirty Tito's martini (always a plus in my book after a long workday). I asked for food suggestions and he recommended the beef short ribs, served with braised leek mashed potatoes and green beans. I didn't know it came with green beans so I ordered a side of asparagus too (I am a huge veggie fan!). I'm gluten free and ate everything I ordered because it was absolutely delicious. I could blame it on not eating lunch but the food was really just that great! 

The owner, Frank, is very personable and checked on me several times throughout the meal, which I thought was very impressive. Having worked in the restaurant business for years, I appreciate it when the owners take the time to visit with the patrons. He was genuinely concerned about my feedback on the meal and even had suggestions for next time I visited (ribeye, lamb shank and gluten free pizza). He recommend I end with a dessert, the affogato, which was an amazingly delicious and unique Italian treat. Normally Im not a dessert eater but this was so unique I had to try it. I certainly recommend it!

Phoenix is in my territory for work and I will definitely come back as there are other entrees on the menu that I want to try. You, too, should give this place a shot! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The reviews were great so we decided to go here.  Unfortunately we were overcharged and were not given Happy Hour prices not informed that some of what we ordered were not part of happy hour.  And then when we questioned the bartender he said \"I'll take it off this time.\" like we were at fault.  Unbelievable poor service.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The ambience is great and the restaurant itself is so cute, great date spot even for you and your ladies! The atmosphere is amazing and the service above par. I'm all about French fries and I'm telling you this place has some top notch poutine that I've gotten to taste in the Phoenix area. That says a lot based off the vast variety of potato dishes I've enjoyed.... but the pizza?? I'm not one to order pizza but the funghi pizza literally had me coming back for more. The food is one thing but the staff and management carry the restaurants persona. Definitely one of my favorite places downtown!"}
{"text":"Love love love the bruschetta. The fig and hummus ones are amazing! The chicken chop combos well with any of their pizzas! The service is great, the staff is knowledgable and really sells the food!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. We ordered the arancini and it was divine - crispy on the outside and warm/ gooey cheese on the inside. The pizza has delicious. The sauce had a hint of sweet which I love and was packed with toppings. Friends ordered halibut tacos and linguini and clams - both loved their meal. 

We split the strawberry basil shortcake and the snicker doodle dessert. The strawberry dessert was like nothing I have ever tasted. It was such an amazing combination of flavors. Very unique and the plating was beautiful.  The snicker doodle was our fave.

The server was attentive and helpful for first timers. He was patient with us gabbing gals. 

The atmosphere was intimate and comfortable. The exposed brick, wall made of wood with candles,  beautiful lighting, and rolled silverware in fancy fabric napkins set the ambience.  Really a great restaurant for a date night or just a dinner with some close friends. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Every single thing was perfect! Express rubbed filet! Pizza! It was all amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Great menu, great service, great execution.  It is now added to my list of favorites.  I had the soup of the day which was a chicken and mushroom in a light cream base. Fantastic!  Also had the pizza Giardino great crust and toppings. Co-workers had bruschetta, burger, and Italian sandwich all top notch.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance! Had the short rib bruschetta per recommendation from the server and it was fantastic. My wife is still raving about it a few days later. We also had  a flat bread pizza, which was quite good, but the bruschetta stole the night."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service and food!!! I am never one to write a review but this place is pretty incredible! Owner came by and talked to us server was friendly and always kept are drinks full!! I got the steamed burger and it was really good! If you have not been here you must go in!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hanging out!!! Great food great company. Erica at the bar gave us great service and suggestions. Had the Chicken Marsala, Pork Chop and Fig bruschetta at the table!! Great. No photos as it was gone in lickity split time!!"}
{"text":"I'll have to admit, we chose to eat at Nook Kitchen because it was within walking distance of Symphony Hall. However, I would definitely go there again and again. I had the braised short rib dinner and it was scrumptious! They actually had their \"melt in your mouth\" meat already off the bone and placed atop mashed potatoes and thin green beans. It was the perfect meal.
I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place. We split the divers scallops and a rossa sausage pizza. Food was great and the food arrived quickly on a Saturday night. We were too full for the dessert menu, but it looked great."}
{"text":"If you are going to be closed for several days for a holiday that is not typical for restaurants to close I would recommend posting on your website or yelp or at least updating your voicemail on your telephone instead of just shutting your phone off."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. The one and only thing that wasn't great was the slow service. It took about 15 minutes to receive the bottle of wine that we ordered. The restaurant is adorable and beautiful. It has a cozy, romantic atmosphere- perfect for a date. I went for my birthday dinner with girlfriends. It's inside the Hilton hotel and you have to enter through the lobby. There's a bar and a cute little living room setup to wait for your table. The food is amazing! We shared the fig bruschetta, which could've used a little more goat cheese but was very tasty. It only comes with 4 pieces, which worked out because there were 4 of us. One of my friends got the short rib which she loved; even the green beans had an amazing flavor. The shrimp fra diavolo was also great, but beware, it is spicy! Another one of my friends couldn't stop eating the filet she ordered because it was so good. I wanted the lamb shank, but they didn't have it anymore. I was really disappointed until I tasted the chicken marsala. It was by far the best I've ever had. I would highly recommend this place. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Omg....this place is amazing!!! Espresso martinis, salmon dish, dessert...nothing disappointed. Not to mention it's in a hot part of downtown. I heard it was connected to Hilton garden inn...so I was...hmmm. No! This hotel looks bomb. I would recommend food, vibe and atmosphere to anyone. Also...the owner is super hot...bonus! Must see!!"}
{"text":"Wait for it.... ok don't! Now run to Nook Kitchen! I already enjoyed this place and I decided to do something special for my wife's birthday. I bought tickets for the ballet and made reservations to stay the night n Phoenix and then while on a business trip I was in Nook and decided to ask the staff if the chef could maybe prepare a special meal for my wife and to top it off she is vegan! They were all willing to help me out and the chef was going to make something that wasn't the standard plate of pasta or a bowl of veggies. I left it up to the chef entirely and OMG he did not let me down! Chef made a grilled portobello mushroom with a ratatouille with pears poach in red wine with sun choke chips and a little hummus with ribbon cut carrots. This was AMAZING!!!! I don't know if I've ever had food that good in my mouth ever! I ordered the Salmon which was amazing but had I known I would have ordered a second of what the chef made for my wife! I can't say thank you enough to the chef and the manager Nick and all of the staff at Nook Kitchen my wife was floored by the effort and instantly fell in love with this place. You will not be disappointed and I am a lifelong customer after this amazing experience!"}
{"text":"NOOK packs the best of everything into the perfect package.
Great Menu, fun vibe and cute space.
Spinach pizza may be the best in the valley!
Halibut Tacos were perfect.
Looking forward to many, many more visits.........."}
{"text":"The food and staff are fantastic! Everything they make us delicious. It's great for any event- dinner with friends, girls night out or family dinner. Highly recommended for always amazing food. I have never had a bad meal and keep going because the pizza is so dang good! The desserts are a must just as good as the food! I love the charcuterie board, it's huge and one of the best in AZ!"}
{"text":"This place has really great reviews, sadly what we ordered did not live up to par. We came here for lunch since we were staying at the hilton garden inn. 

We ordered the avocado bowl($12) and grilled romaine salad with chicken ($16). I would not recommend anyone getting these two items. It was just not good. The avocado bowl was so so so plain and TINY portion you could literally toss this up yourself at home and it would definitely not cost that much. The romaine salad was alright... didn't come with much either and the chicken was soooo dry. Overall experience was pretty average and server wasn't that attentive either."}
{"text":"Name describes the atmosphere perfectly. Great food, good service, and awesome happy hour. Woodfire pizza that is comparable to that place named after a color in Italian."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place. Everything about Nook is spectacular. Especially the food. The pizza is delicious and (don't tell Cibo that I said this...) I actually give it my vote for best pizza in town. I stand by the Porco e Funghi pizza with its floury fire-oven crust and fresh sausage. On a normal day, I cannot stand arancini. When I tasted Nook's I immediately became a fan. The outside is crispy and the inside is just right - not too mushy and not too overdone. I cannot believe it's only $6 for a half-order. Yum! Try the Chicken Chop for a refreshing and creative twist on salad. It's so hard to find good customer service these days. Here at Nook the manager comes out and greets visitors frequently. Hands down..the service at Nook is always top-notch. Sit at the bar and get friendly, fast service. Or sit at a booth and the server will give menu suggestions. On more than one occasion I've been given free 'samples' of menu dishes. Every time I've come in, they remember I love red wine and give tastings from their rotating wine menu. You can also order ahead and carry-out your meal. A plus! I've seen kid-friendly families here and also I've had a handful of swanky romantic date nights. The happy hour deals are a total steal and the Sunday specials are great too. Add Nook to your list."}
{"text":"Came here because the service was so slow at the bar in crudo and ended up being so happy we did. 
The food is great and the ambience is better. If I open a restaurant it will be in this style because I like it so much."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday dinner. So yummy! The decor is absolutely amazing. I fell in love, so classy, so chic, perfect for my bday celebration. I wanted pizza and what a good choice it was! We started with the chicken artichoke bruschetta! Excellent. Then had the four cheese pizza adding spinach. Delicious. Then they brought me a yummy dessert  I loved it!"}
{"text":"First I will say this place does have good food, and that's what's brought us back so many times, but tonight was a different experience.  Our waiter was clearly having a bad night and barely said 10 words to us the whole time we were there.  When we placed our drink order he did not say one word to any of us he just nodded his head.  Then after literally 20 mins (mind you he walked by us a dozen times or more) he came back to take our food order but he seriously just stood in front of our table and did not say anything so finally my husband goes \"I'll have the blah blah blah\" then we all proceeded to order and he just walked away.  He did eventually come by and offer my husband another beer but never brought it, the manager actually stopped by and offered my husband a beer and that one we got. He spent more time standing around talking to other people than he did to his customers.  I get it that people have bad nights but it's not that hard to put a smile on your face and just be polite."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Phoenix and this place is just across the corner from Hotel San Carlos. We were looking inside when one the the owners literally opened the door and welcomed us in. Although we only had a pizza and salad, they treated us like family. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Service was great, atmosphere was great, and we loved the local beer selection. Unfortunately the food was very.... mediocre, especially for the price. $55 for one beer, one appetizer, and one entrée. We try to go out to eat to places that have food that we can't make at home, and everything we ate didn't taste any better than what I could have made myself using the same ingredients. I felt like we were at a diner and an untrained line cook made our food, which is why the price of the food seemed so ridiculous. The bruschetta bread was so under toasted that I had to use two hands to hold it or the toppings would have just fallen off. The short rib meat was tender, but the only flavor to it was sweetness, the potatoes were bland, and there was no texture variation to anything we ate. If you want this kind of food, save your money and hit up your local fast service restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff. Good drinks! Didn't try the food so I can't speak on that. The menu didn't look too tasty to me!"}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated! Nook has great service and great food. 
I highly recommend the salmon with the mashed cauliflower, best cauliflower I've had in my life. The Basil Sour is also delicious~"}
{"text":"Best neighborhood restaurant - it's the kind of spot you want to hit up weekly. Not a pizza on the menu that isn't amazing, excellent service and a relaxing ambiance. If it's not on your list it should be!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Cool bartenders, friendly staff. Had the pork butt and short rib bruschettas and diovala  pizza (all fantastic). Drinks are pretty amazing here also. Def a must once before you die place. Very small, get there early or late."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was excellent. The atmosphere was \"busy\" and a bit crowded, but not to the point of being annoying."}
{"text":"We went here for a fun dinner the other night, and I really enjoyed this place! Inside it's small and cozy, and there's plenty of light from the windows, which I like. Some of their entrees are kind of on the pricey side, but they do have good deals for happy hour so I would try to get there in time for that if you can. 

Our waiter recommended the Short Rib Bruschetta, and I'm glad he did because it was really good! They definitely make very good short ribs and the bread they use for bruschetta is very tasty. For dinner we had the Diavolo Pizza (depending on what you like, this one is more saucy and light on the cheese) and Chicken Marsala, both of which were very delicious! They also serve big portions so you should have plenty to take for leftovers. 

As of this week, their seasonal tap is the Belching Beaver Peanut Butter Milk Stout, which I would highly recommend trying if it's still there. It literally tastes like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup :) I'll definitely be going back to this spot!"}
{"text":"Just outstanding modern Italian fare. We tried a few of their bruschettas, and undoubtedly some of the best in the city, fig being my favorite, and the best Arancini I've ever had. And their Chicken Marsala was as delectable as it gets, with balsamic mushrooms (and I don't even like mushrooms) that I couldn't get enough of!! Long, narrow dining hall with a bar that spans nearly the entire length, rustic modern decor, dim lighting for a romantic feel, just a nice gem tucked away. Oh I nearly forgot, the Sandia specialty cocktail made with Mezcal was something special indeed!"}
{"text":"Damn. Usually a place downtown can survive on location alone. This place doesn't rest on it's laurels. 

It has A+ service and legitimately good AUTHENTIC Italian food (I lived in Italy btw). The prices may seem steep, but after you eat the food you realize this place might be a bargain. 

I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"We loved it there! We only had the pizza, but it was soooo good. The music was great, the place was well designed and thew service was terrific."}
{"text":"I had the Bolognese and my Gf had the scallops. Both meals were overpriced by about 20 percent. The restaurant is in the Hilton Garden in so you are paying hotel up charge pricing. The bar is a great area to eat as they have a circular bar facing the bartenders with great views of TVs. 

The food is slightly above average, the pasta came out a little too al debate for my taste and the Bolognese is average. They just use ground beef instead of other beefs. Would recommend only in a pinch for time."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time. Hit happy hour on a Friday. Great service, our party of six was seated promptly, even though seating somewhat limited due to narrow confines. Attentive and knowledgable waiter. Great food. The bruschetta we tried was excellent, and the pizzas even better. Our favorites were the pork belly bruschetta and the Calabrese pizza. Beer selection on tap rather limits, but what they offer is quality. With wider beer selection would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"If you want some great food, friendly service, and an awesome ambiance then this is the place to try! Seriously, worth the trip if you live far."}
{"text":"Visiting downtown phoenix, night out with the friends or looking for a lavish date night. You have to swing by Nook Kitchen to dine on some Pizza with Pizzaz. The elaborate restaurant is inside the Hilton Garden Inn. The swanky modern entrance is a small representation of the classy feel when you walk through the door. 

My first time experience was an invite for a private party a few days ago during the early evening. I received a warm welcome from the Hostess and a man that I met later in the evening name Nick. The venue was not too pack but had a lively appeal.  Now if I could hire a designer to makeover my home I would hire the person who decorated this venue. It is AMAZING. The modern Italian look with cool vibes. The area where our party was had a unique setup. A large TV, plenty of seating, dim lighting and candles. Perfect area to hold that would hold a small group of friends while they enjoy themselves. The main area had tables perfectly positioned where you did not feel cramped and could enjoy your food. There was a large long table that with unique chairs that seem to be entertaining a business group who truly enjoyed themselves. The bar was defiantly entertaining. You can tell the bar has a nice night life. Lastly the patio area was beautiful. As the venue is located on the corner you get to watch the downtown life while you dine.

Now to the good stuff. The food and drinks! What I like about the menu it is not overwhelming. There is the perfect variety for all types of taste buds. Along with a pleasing drink menu.

Our group started off with a variety of appetizers. I did not eat them personally however, the table did and they gobbled them right up. We ordered Burchettas, The Classic Caprase and Beer Braised Pork Butt. We split the NEW WORLD MARGHERITA and the PROSCIUTTO. The pizza was not only fresh but extremely tasty. You can tell the kitchen uses fresh ingredients. Not one complaint from our large party. The service made the overall experience a pleasure to dine here as well."}
{"text":"Very nice dining experience. Not a great place for young kids but we brought our 10 and 12 year old girls and they enjoyed the food, however if you have picky eaters, pizza is the most kid friendly option. Very nice ambiance and the service was fabulous. Menu featured various options from entrees, pizza, and light fare. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend's and I were downtown to see a show at stand up live so we wanted to eat somewhere close by beforehand. I'm not sure if they were short staffed, but it seemed like they were busier than expected and servers and the hostess were all a bit delayed. We started with the shrimp cocktail and the shrimp were a great size, but there was A LOT of horseradish in the cocktail sauce which took us both by surprise. I had the scallops which were delicious, and my boyfriend was very pleased with the lamb shank. We finished with the ooey gooey buttery cake and that was very good, kind of reminded me of a sugar cookie and cheesecake in one."}
{"text":"So talk about gooood! I'm a pizza connoisseur and so is my girlfriend! This place is fantastic! It reminds me of a small place in Italy called Mario's pizza! Brick oven pizza to perfection! Great service, excellent food, awesome ambiance!! This place is a hidden treasure.. Ask for Ale (pronounced Aly)she is the best!!"}
{"text":"This is location of Nook is my families favorite! We visit this location often comparing to the downtown town one. We love the happy hour menu. Some of my favorite dishes at this spot is their short ribs, which is to die for, their chicken chop salad, which I've had couple times and both times seems a little different but still awesome,their hummus and  Gardino pizza are to die for!"}
{"text":"As part of our taste it tours.  Sampled the bruschetta and their take on the Moscow mule.  Fantastic Taste and atmosphere.   Got to meet the owner and he took time out to tell us the history of the restaurant and gave us a tour of the roof top dining/bar that hasn't opened yet (10 days) that looks amazing and would be a great place to dine or sip a cocktail while covering the skyline and sunsets."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today for the first time and loved the atmosphere and service. Everyone was super nice and helpful and the booths are so cushy and comfy! 

My friend and I shared the Mushroom and Sausage Pizza and the Chicken Chopped Salad. The crust, mushrooms and sausage on the pizza were excellent. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the red sauce. It needed more development, it tasted a bit like tomato paste out of the can. 

The chicken in the salad was grilled and in nice, small, easy-to-eat pieces. The dressing was a bit watered down and lacking in flavor. 

All in all, it seemed like Nook just needs a little bit of fine-tuning but has great potential. I would definitely be willing to give it another go, mainly based on the excellent service."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. Were heading to a presentation at the Comerica and found this place on Yelp of course. It was highly rated but I was skeptical as I walked up realizing it was a hotel. All prejudgments were totally unsubstantiated. 

The ambiance was very pleasant even though a little crowded. Service was impeccable and fast. I went with my Son and wife. I had the Poutine (Canadian Comfort Food) with braised pork. It was fabulous. Portion was huge and served hot. The braised pork was amazing. My Son had the Seared Scallops. How do you define perfect...I do a pretty good seared scallop but this was a whole new dimension in reality of how a scallop should be cooked. It was so soft and tasty the one that was offered to me by my son soon became 2! My wife had a nice pizza with veggies. She saw someone else get it and was enamored with the presentation and was not disappointed in taste. It was like we did a rotation of foods. My wife was sharing my Poutine and I was sharing my sons scallops and he was sharing my wife's pizza. Each one of us had nothing but good comments of each others dish. 

I can highly and without reserve recommend this as a great place to eat when downtown."}
{"text":"Poutine!!  To my Canadian friends, it's legit!  Where else can you even find poutine in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I really liked everything I ordered from the beer selection, appetizer and entree (pizza). The place is very small and it gets a little hot from the pizza oven so dress accordingly. Overall, a very cool little spot with great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing service I would love this waitress  work for our company. She delivered a five star experience
Allie your owners should be thankful to have you 
Thank you for the great service.,

Now for the food
Pizza was very good
Steak was cooked prefect 
Chicken  bruschetta must have 

You should try this place"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and both times were fantastic. Olives are a must. Short rib is amazing. Can't wait to try the one on Monroe"}
{"text":"From the aranchini to the pizza to the pasta to the wine and beer selection and the service definitely recommend this place for more of a low key starter to your Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for steering us to a great restaurant. Had the Filet which melted like butter in my mouth, hubby had the Porco e Funghi pizza which he described as better than LGO's overpriced pizza, and he was not left wanting for another pizza as he only was able to eat half of the 12\" serving (rare for him). Jorge was a great waiter and the only thing I could imagine him giving us after was a ride home, he was funny and honest. The desert I wanted was the bread pudding but at the moment they are not serving it (per Jorge it may be back). We ordered the Nookerdoodle (sp?), which tasted like a cake baked in a cookie pie with ice cream on top. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I liked that when I asked for Iced Tea I received real iced tea and not a strange funky flavor one like many places give you. This place recently opened and our server was very attentive and took the time to explain the menu to us. He strongly favored the halibut tacos and said they were his single favorite thing on the menu so I ordered them. 

I need to note we were here for lunch so this is only a lunch review based on just one visit.

I soon received them and they were I think the most figure friendly meal I ever had out. Aprox. three oz. of halibut between two lettuce leaves (instead of tortillas) , pickled onion , Mexi style tomatoes , avocado , radish,  some crunchy greens and a very mild sauce. This plate was a bit on the mild side for my taste but maybe the intention of the dish was to taste the fish and not to over power it. This plate came with a side of black beans that were seasoned and had some flavors going on. This seemed like a very healthy meal to have out. I also liked that they used halibut and not something like muddy catfish or tilapia.

My husband tried the Charcuterie. It was sort of like an around the world kind of plate. It had five kinds of meat , a Chinese Sausage, a Hungarian Sausage, Italian Meats, Fig Jam, Toast, whole grain mustard, pickles, olives and a wedge of Brie Cheese.

I noticed an interesting Connecticut Style Steamed burger on the menu that you just don't find too often that might have been fun to try. Someone seated next to us got one and I thought it looked good. 

3.5 stars Rounded up for above average service."}
{"text":"Great place to eat dinner! We sat down around 9PM and the place was pretty empty for a Saturday night... however 30 minutes later a crowd came out of nowhere. 

The owner is friendly, personable, and (from what we witnessed) a genuinely good manager. He checked on us multiple times and went out of his way to make us feel welcome. Our table got the New World Margherita pizza, Chicken Marsala, Lamb Shank, Cowboy Rib Eye, and last bit not least... the Ooey Gooey Butter Cake for dessert (literally the best). Everything was phenomenal! Even the food presentation was well thought out and visually appealing. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"The Diavolo pizza is the best pizza I've ever had! Way better than Bicanco! It's a must have is you like a little kick with your pizza."}
{"text":"So so good. I was in Phoenix on business so i sauterned in there alone and sat at the bar. It was packed on a tuesday night. I got the fig bruchetta was so good, i almost got another order as my meal. Thank goodness i didn't because i ended up with the bolognase pasta and it was divine. I just didn't have enough room for dessert. Two glasses of wine later and i ended up sitting there talking to the bartender and some other folk. It felt like I was in my neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"I've been in a few times to the Nook now and have never been disappointed! The Diavolo pizza is ahhhmazing (perfect spice, great tasting thin crust right from the wood fired oven), and they have Poutine (fries with gravy and cheese on them)!  I'm Canadian and you don't see poutine on any menu down here very often. It's not your legit Quebec poutine (the Nook uses crumbled cheese instead of cheese curds), but it is tasty and satisfies my craving for sure!  
Last time we were in Nick was our server and he was fantastic...very funny and very attentive. Oh and they even have happy hour on Sunday! $5 glasses of wine, $2 off cocktails and cheaper appetizers. We love this neighborhood spot, it has charm and a great atmosphere ...check it out!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal or cocktail at Nook. Both indoor and outdoor seating are nice, and my boy Dustin always takes care whether you're a cocktail novice or patron of patrons. Thanks Nook for providing this lady with yummy options"}
{"text":"Loved the vibe and the ambiance! Customer service is superb, although I did get bumped into about twenty times (by other customers...and then even hit on the back of my head on accident by one of the waiters!!) due to my position of where I was seated. I'm giving Nook three stars because the portions of the appetizers were miniscule! They were most def tasty, but, in my opinion, was NOT a good value. I think I will have to give it another chance during happy hour. - and about the yummy-smelling, delectable hand/body scrub in the bathroom...I, too, was tempted to buy that lil crock o' goodness."}
{"text":"Super food and great service. 
One of our party has food sensitivities which were readily accommodated by both the server and then the chef came out to visit our table to confirm. 
Hummus plate appetizer superb as are pizzas and pork chop."}
{"text":"I went in close to closing time, but got a beer and ordered the food to go. They had a Tucson beer on tap, Sentinel Peak, which being from Tucson (Bear Down!), I couldn't resist. I debated but landed on the Short Rib, which included mashed potatoes and French green beans. It far exceeded expectations. I typically expect short ribs to be fatty. These were pulled off the bone and were moist and flavorful and had very little fat. Will definitely come back but it will be hard to try something different."}
{"text":"The Nook was great. This is where we went for my father's 60th birthday dinner. My mother had been and told me how good it was. So, I said lets go there for dad's birthday. I was very impressed. The drinks were great (try their take on a Negroni - fabulous). It only got better from there. We started the meal with a Chicken Chop Salad, which was great. And then shared 2 pizzas. I highly suggest The Nook! They have great food and a good cocktail program. The espresso was pretty good too. The service was perfect. I can't say enough. I'm going back!"}
{"text":"Thrilled that this classic building has been brought back to life. There are so few older buildings in Phoenix. The Nook Is an excellent part of the overall experience. 
All 5 of us really enjoyed our meals. The grilled romaine salad had great presentation, fresh ingredients and was a good sized meal. Chicken marsala was excellent. Two of us had pizza. Crust could have been a bit crispier, but overall very good. 
Will definitely back."}
{"text":"This is the sort of place that makes foodies happy but can please anyone.  Everything is delicious and interesting, but in ways that aren't intimidating.  Plus the atmosphere is lovely and the service is excellent.

One foodie indication: the menu was absolutely perfect for the season.  The lightness and freshness of the tastes is just perfect for summer.  The halibut tacos were served with avocado and radishes in lettuce wraps - perfect!  The strawberry and basil shortcake was so incredibly refreshing and delicious (please order this, you won't be sorry!).  The Giardino pizza, though lovely in any season, was so incredibly aromatic that we couldn't wait to eat it!  And the bruschetta that we started with had halved cherry tomatoes instead of shopped ones - interesting as well as tasty.  Even the service was lovely and enthusiastic.

All this wonderful foodie food came in nice portions, and we had an appetizer, two dinners and a dessert for about $50.

We'd been wanting to try this place, but with all of the amazing gourmet pizza in Phoenix/Scottsdale, it took a while.  We're so glad we did!!"}
{"text":"This place has an enticing menu, but it totally sucks.  The only two times I've eaten here I ordered for take out.  Both times they got the order incorrect which I didn't notice until I got home so had to drive back.  We paid $15 for the most pathetic and tiny bruschetta.  Was seriously a joke.  Smallest pieces of bread ever.  No apologize or any kind of discount for the hassle.  Won't come back."}
{"text":"When I arrive at the place, they just have taken my friend to our table. However, the table was wet all over and the booth as well. I think they used a wet towel clean the table and the booth and forgot to wipe them with a dry towel. My friend mentioned it to the hostess and she didn't do anything and just walked away. We used the napkins that were on the table and wiped it ourselves before we can sit. Other than that the service for the rest of the night was pretty good. 

We were there for Happy Hour, so we ordered Poutine($5), Fig Bruschetta($7), and Caprese Bruschetta($5) from the HH menu. I love French fries so Poutine was a good choice it has gravy and sprinkled some mozzarella curds over the fries and topped with a fried egg ($2 extra). Fig Bruschetta top with thin slices of meat, a piece of asparagus and some goat cheese and the combination tasted so delicious. Caprese Bruschetta has halved cherry tomato and mozzarella cheese and it was so yummy. Another friend came later and join us she had the Porco e Funghi without mushroom. I was so full with my selections so I didn't try her pizza but she almost finish the whole thing I assume it was good. 

I am still trying to search my wine selections and Nook gave me that option. They don't commit until you said you like it. Over all I had a great experience here. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and beautiful atmosphere in downtown location. Appetizers were all delicious and pizzas particularly the funghi were sensational! The speed of service was perfect and relaxing but efficient as we were going to a comedy show after. My only small complaint were the tiny glasses of wine. I will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"After catching a concert at Valley Bar, we decided to grab some food at Nook since it was AZ Restaurant Week and less than a block away. The interior of Nook has a great classic, chic atmosphere but it was a nice evening in downtown Phoenix so we sat outside on the patio. The service was prompt, very attentive and offered the Arizona Restaurant Week menu right away. 

Here's the lowdown on the food we ate: 

Appetizer: Arancini - A crisp exterior with a creamy, cheesy, risotto filled center. The squiggle of balsamic reduction on the side added some tartness and acidity to cut through the heaviness of the creamy risotto. Perfection! 

Entree: Eggplant Parmesan Napoleon - So filling! Layer upon layer of breaded eggplant, thick garlic pomodoro sauce, mozzarella cheese, repeated then topped off with a pile of freshly chopped basil. Oh, so cheesy and a slight hint of a spicy aftertaste.

Dessert: Olive Oil Lemon Ricotta - An airy extra virgin olive oil lemon ricotta cake topped with strawberry and rosemary compote and a scoop of delicious olive oil ice cream. We were informed the cake has been changed slightly from the description. It was topped with a blueberry sauce instead of strawberry compote. Not sure if that was just for the evening or a full time change? The blueberry was good but I think I would have preferred the strawberry with the this cake. 

NOTE: Bathrooms are located within the Hilton Garden Inn, which is a nice excuse to check out the swanky lobby of the hotel. If you are around the area, I recommend you stopping in for a bite to eat at Nook Kitchen."}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian pizza and asked them to not put cheese on it, and I was so impressed that the pizza- even without cheese was insanely flavorful and delicious. The cheese was not missed at all.

For that reason I give them five stars. It's a cute place overall, the ambience is nice - we sat at the bar. The service was good - but really, if the pizza can be insanely delicious without any cheese, that means they know what they're doing when it comes to their veggies!

Thank you for a good meal :)"}
{"text":"Nook is one of our favorite neighborhood spots! We have been here three times since it opened, and love it every time. We have tried the prosciutto pizza and the fungi pizza, as well as several appetizers. Their happy hour is great, and prices for non-happy hour food are very reasonable too. The service always makes us feel welcome, and they go out of their way to recognize locals."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my sweetheart for the first time and we were so glad we did! We had the risotto appetizer and a half order of the BBQ bruschetta then for the entrée we split the Chicken Marsala. Everything was so very yummy and the risotto was way better than any we have had before!! The Marsala is a dish I always love but my sweetheart was not sure about trying because she normally doesn't like it. This time though she loved it, and they split it up for us in the kitchen and gave us our own plates! Ralph was our server and he was so friendly and helpful with suggestions :) we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Food was a little underwhelming. Wasn't quite worth the price. Food was lukewarm, noodles were hard, and the shrimp was overcooked. I think we may have just caught them on a bad day. Will definitely try again. Service was excellent. Can't say enough good things about the staff."}
{"text":"The best pork chops I've had since moving to the west coast :) I'm a sort of a picky eater but the waiter accommodated my request to have mashed potatoes instead sweet potatoes (which were probably delicious because everything else was)  
The owner even made sure we were doing okay as well. Really great place!
If I'm ever in the Phoenix area again, I would definitely spot by again! Probably going to try recreating this dish when I get back home :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Easily the best place I've been in phoenix. The ambience is nice, I especially liked the leather lounge chairs. 

The food is excellent,  and I managed to make it in for happy hour so I got excellent value for my money. I ordered the arancini, and the beer braised pork butt bruschetta for my apps. The arancini were one of the best appetizers I've had in my entire life. The bruscetta were good but they cooled down very quickly so they became proportionally less attractive. They were also piled high so they were a little difficult to fit in the mouth. 

The entree I had was the Salmon. I have to admit, I didn't go for seafood. I was going to get chicken, but I decided to gamble and asked my waitress what she ordered when she ate there. Paid off very nicely. I was extremely satisfied with the fish, nice lightly charred with just a hint of the rosemary sprig that it was speared with. The squash were very flavorful with an unexpected but very pleasant spiciness. And the mashed cauliflower was amazing, I love cauliflower but I've never thought to make it like that before. 

I live in Texas, just in phoenix for the weekend on business, but this place will definitely be on my itinerary next time I come through here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to have a drink or meal. Phoenix can be quiet but this place is happening. Amazingly professional and friendly staff. The food was outstanding. I stayed in town for 5 nights and ate here every night working my way through the menu. Good value for money too. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Horrible service! My hubby told our waiter it was my birthday, he said happy birthday and he had a desert for me. He never brought it out. He suggested two of their drinks that were disgusting! The worst cocktails I've ever tasted in my life."}
{"text":"Food and service were outstanding! Had the scallops and eggplant parmesan, absolutely delicious . 5 stars! Great vibe, felt like we were back in NYC! We will  definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing find.  We had a large group of 8 people and out waitress Allie was heaven sent.  All of her recommendations were spot on.  Standouts were the poutine, scallops, and the short rib.  Really great food and amazing service."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great atmosphere!!!! Pizzas and scallops were yummy and the salad and caprese are fresh and tasty.  Frank and the Gang, you are rocking it!!"}
{"text":"I usually hesitate to eat at restaurants that are attached to hotels I'm staying at, but it was stormy and hot outside so I popped in here for dinner. No joke, this is some of the best food I've had. My server was very personable and helpful as well (thanks, Victoria!). I can only speak for what I had -- and all that I had was top notch.

1. Wood-Fired Olives. I thought maybe I'd get 8, but was impressed with probably 40 of these little yum-balls, soaking in a meltlicious puddle of seasoned butter. A generous portion of crostini accompanied them -- the perfect vehicle for soaking up the leftover butter.

2. Pizza Bianco - Funghi. I don't know how to describe this. It was delicious. The crust was maybe a little sweet, but I ate it right up. 

3. Trapiche Malbec. Just yum.

This meal would have been perfect for two; I ate exactly half. I had the other half cold the next night. (Because, well, bachelor I guess.) STILL GOOD."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  Great food and exceptional service. I tried the other things my family got such as steak, truffle pizza and chicken bruchetta. All were excellent. Will definitely be back and will try their downtown location"}
{"text":"The Nook is one of the best places I've been in Phoenix or anywhere! Awesome food and atmosphere and the staff is so welcoming, professional and efficient. The scallops were extraordinary and they have an impressive wine selection. I would absolutely make a point of going there again the next time I'm in the area. HIGHLY recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome meal. Love that I can get my favorite carbonara dish here! Good wine selection too!"}
{"text":"I went with my dear friend for a usual two Friday's a month for dinner. This restaurant slash bar is a typical hang-out for my friend. So I decided to give it a try. I'm glad that I did. The place is set up like a high-end bar. They have a very long bar and provide all the latest cocktails and wines. They have an extensive wine selection and if you go during happy hour. You can get some great prices on wines and beers on tap. The dinner menu is fantastic as well. Not as extensive as some other places like this, but it'st the quality, not the quantity. My friend had the filet mignon, and I had the scallops. The food was cooked perfectly and we had wine to go with our meal. All in all, I would recommend this place as a great getaway from work, or just to go somewhere that is casual without the pretension. Great place! I completely enjoyed it."}
{"text":"What a great addition to DT Phoenix! Nook is located in the Hitlon Garden Inn right off the lobby. They have a nice dining room inside and a large patio as well. 

We decided to try this place at 7pm on a Saturday without a reservation and they were able to seat us right away. Our server was great and our food came out pretty fast. We had the diavolo pizza and shrimp pasta. Both were very tasty!

I will definitely come back and try more!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem. We booked a reservation for a party of 10 to celebrate a birthday. Honestly, I was concerned when I pulled up to a strip mall, but I needn't have been concerned. A group of 10, and not one meal not enjoyed. The only reason for 4 stars? When we asked our waiter for recommendations, he said that every dish was \"the best in Phoenix\"....all of the dishes were great, but definitely would have appreciated his genuine input."}
{"text":"another little gem in Arcadia.  

The mushroom pizza  and chicken chop salad are all I've had so far, but both were very good.

Cool ambience...I will go again"}
{"text":"Grilled artichoke and caprese bruschetta are good for sharing.. We ordered arancini because of the wonderful reviews, but we thought it lacked flavor.. Very kind waitress (Aly) and the draft beer \"uno más\" was great!"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding! We had the short rib brushetta and the special appetizer of the day. They were excellent but the real treat was our main courses. I had the scallops and my boyfriend had the chicken marsala which were the best we've had in a long time. We finished off with some butter cake which was absolutely excellent and I'm not even a dessert person!  We got great, attentive servicr as well. A little pricey but well worth it and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"A cute little restaurant located inside the Hilton Garden Inn downtown. I really enjoyed the modern decor with the symmetrical gold light fixtures. They offered both inside and outside seating and I love how they use the wine wall to separate a part of the dining room next to the bar. 
I started off with a Moscow mule and I loved loved that the drink was served in a copper mug. I know it's only a mug but when I order that drink, i expect it to be served in a copper mug. The beer choices were also really good.
Then we ordered the Charcuterie plate which was amazing!!! The portion was generous and everything on the plate was so delicious. It's one of the best charcuterie plates I've tasted. I was a little bummed that it was served on a plate instead of a cheese board but it was so good that it didn't matter. Then for our main dish we ordered the baby scallops served with grill white asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, grilled potato coins, white chocolate bean cream topped with fried wonton strips. The scallops were plump and juicy and it had a nice sweet taste from the white chocolate bean sauce.
Overall I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant, the food was delicious and our server was great. For our 3 drinks, appetizer and main entree our bill came out to $100 which is a bit pricy but at least the food was amazing so it was money well spent!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 6:00 PM. The service was attentive and excellent. The pizza was great - a very thin crust that I just couldn't stop eating. And I usually really restrict my carbs! We also had a quinoa salad with added chicken, which was also excellent. ANd the chef made a small bowl of linguini for my 1-year old granddaughter to nibble on.

We ate at the outdoor tables while she made a huge mess, and the staff was really sweet about it. As my first visit to Phoenix, this made a good impression on me.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was on the way to place a to go order but they closed early. Disappointed but they said they lacked business tonight so I guess I understand."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 4 or 5 times.  All other visits have been 4/5 stars. The pizza is great, never a bad pie. Highly recommend the poutine. This review receives less stars and it is partly my fault. I asked the pretty blonde girl behind the bar for a glass of Cabernet, and she poured me a taste and it was fine. So great that I had 2 glasses.  However when the bill came, little did I know they were $14 per glass. Again, partial my fault for not asking ahead of time, but I'm sure there are lesser wines on the menu and typically when you say \"I'll have a Cabernet\" you usually receive the house wine.  I'm sure I'll be back, but this visit left a bad taste"}
{"text":"Not the best experience. Our server had an attitude since we got to Nook Kitchen. He seemed annoyed to even have to talk to us. 

My friends and I only wanted to have a nice night out with drinks and good food. One of our friends was visiting from Denver and knowing that he's a foodie we thought Nook Kitchen would be a great place to take him.

Sadly, the moment we got there the experience started out wrong as our server was kind of sassy. 

We ordered appetizers but we never got them. My friend from out of town asked for his steak to be sliced and the answer was no because we are very busy but I'll bring you a knife... what bothered us wasn't too much the response of our server, but the tone and attitude he responded! 

When we finally got our food, we asked our server what happened with the appetizers and he seemed to have no idea of what we were talking about... with that we asked for those items not to be charged to us for obvious reasons (we never got them) and again our waiter seemed annoyed by that.

The food was good but not great! The bolognese was kind of bland and the pizza was undercooked. However the steaks was amazing and the chicken masala had a lot of flavor to it. 

Nowadays I believe that when you got out to eat it's not only about the food but also about the whole experience. One thing we all were expecting was for our waiter to say something about the whole bad experience... at least \"I'm sorry about the appetizers\" but nothing... we barely saw him again that other than when he brought us the check.

The good thing in our case was that the manager/owner noticed what happened to us and came to our table to apologize! He tried to make it right to us and even gave us a gift certificate to get the appetizers we never got. I do appreciate that a lot as not every manager/owner would have done that. I don't know that we'll be coming back, but if we do I just hope we get a different waiter and now I know to go for the steak instead of the pasta!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place! The service was amazing! The servings are big for a great price! MUST try the pork butt bruschetta. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience.  Cool ambiance, great drinks. Chicken Marsala is exceptional.  I'm from out of town but would be a regular here if I lived closed by."}
{"text":"Where do I even start, there is so many great thing about Nook Kitchen. First of all the GM Nick was outstanding, he accommodated everything to what we needed to make the bridal dinner amazing. His energy is what brought me into the restaurant. At one point in the night we ended up being the only table in the restaurant, Nick kindly asked if we would like to play other music and let's just say the bridal party loved it!! Nicks hospitality was outstanding and I will for sure be coming back because of him. The food was to die for, the green olive appetizer dish is amazing. Everyone's food was amazing, couldn't go wrong with anything food wise. The drinks are out of the world as well. I highly recommend Nook Kitchen and I will be back for sure with more friends and family!!!"}
{"text":"I love nook! And this was my first time at the downtown location. I was actually stunned at how gorgeous it is. I love the Arcadia location but this felt different! We were greeted promptly and chose a table near the window to look at the grey afternoon. Mom and I had just seen Ballet Arizona's performance of the Nutcracker and were in the mood for some quick lunch before we went Christmas shopping. Our server was cute and fun and provided a great experience for us. We started with the poutine- and folks you really got to spring for the fried egg on top. Adds such a delicious flavor throughout the dish. I had to literally push the plate away from me otherwise I would have eaten the entire thing and licked the plate. The gravy and cheese curds are so deliciously bad! 

I repented by ordering the Harvest Quinoa salad. The presentation was beautiful and mixing all the ingredients together with that delicious dressing was really a home run. We also got two pizzas to take with us I ordered the Funghi with sausage and my mom ordered the Quattro Fromaggio. I love the thin flakey crust and the flavors are so evenly distributed, making every bite a winner.

Can't forget my cocktail! I ordered the Sultry Sage (or something like that) and it was sweet and strong and perfectly foamy from the egg whites!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the staff. The bartender has a fantastic attitude and a darn good sense of humor. He asked me if I wanted to sit at the bar since I was alone. I said no thanks since I've been in front of a large group speaking all day. I wanted a cozy table all to myself. His sense of humor and generous spirit had me laughing and somewhat regretting not sitting at the bar. Thank you for the smiles! 

The waitress was helpful and attentive. The manager visited to ensure my evening was going well. Five stars times three for all three staff members I encountered.

Five stars for the specialty cocktail. It's monsoon season in Phoenix 100+ degree heat...so it's not a dry heat! I wanted a mojito to cool off and shake off my rough day, and although it wasn't on the menu, the bartender made a spectacular version with fresh mint and a blood lime. Yes, folks; it's a green lime on the outside with red flesh on the inside. It was a flavorful and perfectly balanced mojito. Too bad I have to work tomorrow and didn't want to risk a second drink. 

Five stars for the ambiance. Comfortable and stylish seating in the modern and Art Deco style is everywhere you look. There's the bright bar area, a darker and private alley of tables, open restaurant seating, etc. I sat in a plush velvet chair and sunk into the lushness, which helped relax my stressful state. I could work on my phone in privacy and yet feel enveloped in comfort. 

The food is the big old snag here. I asked the waitress if I should order the short ribs or a gluten-free pizza. She said the short ribs without a doubt, so even though it was twice the price of a pizza, I went for it. The green beans, sauce, and mashed potatoes were delicious. The meat was disappointingly dry...dry...dry like I wish the Phoenix heat is. Chuckle! I received an impressively large portion, so I was initially pleased. Then, I tasted the short ribs and realized the portion is big because they are trying to get rid of it. Shucks. It could have been a raving 5-Star review all around, but the food is barely worth three stars. I really should drop a star for the lack of gluten-free options on the menu in each category. For example, if you want dessert, forget it. There isn't a gluten-free option, so you might as well stop by the front desk and buy an outrageously priced roll of Rolos if you're craving chocolate. 

Overall, I gave four stars, but if you are only interested in food, don't eat here. I really was hoping for a wonderful meal since I'm a foodie, but I still walked away mostly satisfied because of the staff and ambiance. Thanks for a pleasant evening in general!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing and the staff was very friendly and engaging. We were a large group of 15 people and they handled our orders with ease. Hubby and I tried the charcuterie and were not impressed. But we did try the scallops and chicken Marsala from others and found them to be absolutely delicious. Not sure if the food is comparable to the high prices but we would go back again and try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"the customer service here is impeccable. our waitress was awesome, the host was amazing, and one of the owners kept checking on us throughout the meal. all around wonderful!!!! 

We stumbled upon Nook while doing the Sat night dinner search and are so glad we accidentally (serendipitously?) found it! 

Delectable pizzas (a sausage mushroom red pizza, and the shrimp white pizza - my fave), awesome short rib bruschetta, and the desserts.... couldn't even share! I had the bread pudding - yum! And husband had the affogato, which he loved (and i could only enjoy the smell, as i'm still pregnant)

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went in last night for dinner and although we had made a reservation the tables were all taken so we had to sit at the bar which was pretty disappointing. However, the manager went out of his way to explain the mixup and offer us a couple glasses of wine which I really appreciated. Good customer service is hard to come by, his nice attitude and acknowledgement of the situation was appreciated. Hope he reads this!"}
{"text":"I went to try out this place with my mom for lunch. We sat at the bar to order. The bartender was extremely rude! He took a long time to take our order. He disappeared several times without checking back with us.  He didn't refill our drinks. Also, he dropped the check off without asking if we needed anything else and didn't make eye contact or provide optimal customer service. I made a complaint to the manager about the experience and how it ruined our lunch. The manager was very kind in offering a complimentary entrée, but I told her that I would appreciate her talking to the rude bartender. He had an attitude and on top of that he gave us the wrong bill so when I told him it was incorrect he grabbed it so viciously and without apologizing for the mistake. He didn't seem like he wanted to serve us and just made our experience so not enjoyable! I don't know if I will go back even though the manager gave us a complimentary entrée."}
{"text":"This place was a dream. My boyfriend and I went there on New Years Eve for dinner and sat at the bar. We shared a bottle of champagne and had some amazing food. It really made our night. All of the staff behind the bar was so amazing. I know it must have been hard to work on a holiday but they were so sweet and accommodating. We will be eating here again."}
{"text":"After the Strong Beer Festival I stopped in here with some friends.  We were seated quickly at a table for six people and had prompt, friendly service.

We all shared the poutine, short rib bruschetta and chicken artichoke bruschetta.  All of our food tasted delicious and the happy hour prices were great."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service and recommendation for the meat lovers pizza and another one with truffle oil. The best I've tried in Phoenix in 13 years."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening for drinks and dessert. Ordered \"Salted Caramel Pumpkin Bread Pudding\" supposedly \"served warm with bourbon praline sauce, candied spice pepitas, and cinnamon ice cream.\" The bartender brought a piece of dried-out lemon cake plated with some toffee on the side--a strange combination. I said, we ordered the bread pudding. He said, yeah, that's the bread pudding. We didn't know what to say. Then I looked on the menu and lemon cake isn't even offered. If you're out of a dessert, say so, but don't embarrass guests into eating something they didn't order."}
{"text":"Maybe more like 4 1/2, but rounded up due to the great service on both occasions.  A special shout-out to Ale (I'm spelling her name correctly, but it's pronounced Allie), who really knew the menu completely, and was able to answer all of our questions patiently and in detail when we inquired about ingredients and preparation.  

I'm always partial to restaurants that deliver more than what you would expect from the appearance of the place.  Nook has a very basic look, a combination of booths and a bar and tables.  You go in expecting OK or average bar food but it is so much better than that.

I've been twice with large enough parties that I've been able to taste a number of these really well-prepared dishes.  The arancini are a perfect meld of the risotto, mozzarella and Pomodoro.  These were definitely prepared by someone who knew the flavor profile for perfect arancini.  The poutine is absolutely as special as others have written earlier.  Poutine is still not a dish that can be easily found on American menus, and this poutine is terrific.  Do get it with fried egg, which really adds to the potato and gravy flavors, but I'd advise skipping the optional short rib, which we all agreed made the dish too heavy.  And believe me, it is already a heavy dish, but so, so good.

The scallops were done perfectly, moist, flavorful, with just the right amount of resistance to the bite.  And the pizza, much to my surprise, was excellent.  I'm from Chicago, as much a pizza town as any, and I personally tend to prefer thin and crispy crusts.  Yet Nook's ingredients were so high end, and the crust, while softer than I usually like, had a pull and chewiness that was actually quite good.  Really fresh ingredients, and sausage that was bursting with flavor.

I highly recommend Nook.  The food and service are much more than you're going to expect when you first walk through the door, and you'll have a tasty and fun experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant can count itself amongst Phoenix finest! Don't be fooled by the casual atmosphere. The food deserves fine white linen and cut glass. My husband tasted the double pork chop and I had the most delicious scallops cooked to perfection. Both meals were presented beautifully and cooked to perfection. What a treasure this little place is. Cannot speak highly enough of the quality of food and excellant service."}
{"text":"Great comfort food! I had heard about the Nook Kitchen from a co-worker who raved about it. It's a great space which I could see being very busy for happy hour and on Friday nights. The food was excellent.  We tried a few of the bruschetta (fig and chicken artichoke).  My friend had the pizza which was excellent (thin crust). I had to try a piece.  I had the bolognese pasta which was yummy.  The pasta is made in house and you can tell.  The sauce was amazing, and I almost felt like licking the plate (but I know that's not appropriate).  
Nick our waiter was very friendly and provided us with good service. 
I look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"Cute!!  Took my work bestie here for a birthday lunch a couple weeks back.  They have valet but we opted for street parking about a 30 second walk away and paid like $1.50. Score.  It's located in the lobby inside the Hilton Garden Inn so in order to get there you will need to enter through the hotels entrance.  
Service was great.  Everyone was accommodating, efficient, friendly and our server was wonderfully patient as it took my friend and I a good 20 minutes just to order our drinks. Sorry dude, we're girls and we need to get all of our talking out before we stuff our faces. 

The menu consisted of standard lunch options: pizza, bruschetta, salads, sandwiches, etc.  We decided to order the caprese bruschetta as well as the fig and share the two.  The caprese was fine.  Nothing spectacular but it got the job done.  The fig however was outstanding.  It was made up of fig jam, prosciutto, goat cheese and asparagus.  It was like a slightly more savory version of my favorite prosciutto and brie sandwich from Postino.  I thought the asparagus wouldn't bled well with the other toppings but it provided a nice contrast of flavor and crunch. 

The atmosphere in here is rad and I would love to come back in the evening to check out their dinner menu and see how this place transforms at night."}
{"text":"As I've probably said before, I generally try and shy away from chain restaurants and restaurants in hotels.  However, this one had some good reviews and I was not feeling like walking too far.  I was glad that I stayed!

It was a lovely evening in downtown Phoenix and we sat outside in their small patio.

Service was friendly and efficient.  I thought the wine list was a little limited and pricey, but the menu was interesting and fairly broad.

My salmon was awesome, served hot and tasty.  Perfectly prepared.

Our other entree was one of their flatbreads.  It was larger than expected, nice crust, nice toppings.

Overall, a cut above."}
{"text":"Stopped in after flying into Phoenix and was DANG hungry!! We received very friendly and prompt service. Great variety of delicious things to order! Quite pleased with The Nook! Great pizza! Can't wait to go back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful and relatively new it is right next to Tuesday morning, and down from zips sports bar.  you absolutely have to try all the appetizers and get there for happy hour prices and it's very affordable, like most places watch the drinks that's what's will get you.  I have brought many friends to this place because it's absolutely wonderful I'm waiting for the owner to to say thank you and appreciate the fact that I'm bringing in business, this is definitely a place worth trying and checking out."}
{"text":"I tried The Nook on a whim. It's a small restaurant with dim lighting tucked away in a strip mall. I ordered everything based on my waiter's suggestions and it was delicious. All of it. Definitely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"tried this place on a whim with some friends during the lunch hour, and it was awesome. I had a veggie pizza and wasn't really expecting much, but it was actually better than the overly - hyped pizzas at cibos and pizzeria bianchi. the service was good, and the food came out fast. great lunch hour experience. highly recommend."}
{"text":"We enjoyed lunch here on a Thursday. Great veggie and tuna sandwiches. French fries were good, but not great. Staff was pleasant and shared knowledge of the area with us since we were visiting from out of town. Nice interior and ambiance and place was very clean."}
{"text":"Great food cool atmosphere and 1/2 bottles of wine in Sunday's. Salmon and Nook Spicy chicken where great."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm!

Tried it out for Happy Hour and lunch just a few days apart.  We tried the steamed hamburger and fries, chicken chopped salad and bruschetta.  All were so good.  We didn't even have room for dessert.

Lunch we tried pizza and salad and were not disappointed.  Unfortunately no room for dessert again, but I hear it is tasty.

My only complaint was that when I was there for Happy Hour the management and others were trying out samples from the kitchen where diners could see them.  It just seemed a little unprofessional.  Other than that, I will definitely keep going back and trying out more of the menu....maybe even dessert!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended! The name describes this wonderful restaurant perfectly. I started with a grilled romaine with mozzarella and red vinaigrette dressing...awesome flavor. Fully expecting the salmon with the cauliflower mash to be as tasty, it was fresh, prepared exactly as requested \"medium\", and delicious. The Nook delivered on the service and a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I chose Nook for pizza and a central meeting place for an Military Mom meeting.  The waiter seemed annoyed we were taking our time. The restaurant was slow. It did not fill up through out the evening. The pizza oven was broken so I didn't have pizza. I then tried to order Bolognese, no luck. So I asked what they did have and ended up with a more expensive dish.  It was ok. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Nook Kitchen. Lots of friends have given it high marks and I see why. Ambiance is quirky but classy and the menu is creative. The service was a little slow (had to ask for refills on drinks), but friendly. We went for a late lunch on a weekday and had no trouble getting a table. Split a sausage and mushroom pizza ($13) which was very good. Also shared a grilled romaine salad ($13) which was also good and an innovative dish (yes, I said \"grilled\" lettuce) but honestly, would have liked a little more conventional salad option (but they don't offer one). Overall, very good food, atmosphere and dining experience."}
{"text":"I love this resto!  I seriously crave their chicken marsala like its going out of style.  I'm not much of a dine out type of person, but every time I go in the music is super chill, the ambiance is great and there is just a great vibe about the place. The staff is super attentive and friendly and by the time I get home with the little brown box of deliciousness, I am in heaven!  triple yum!"}
{"text":"The arancini rice balls burned the ever lovin bejesus out of my mouth. Would have been nice if they let them cool or at least warn you before serving them straight out of the fryer. 3 days later I still have very painful blisters in my mouth. They were OK, but certainly not worth the burn... 

Short rib \"bruschetta\" was really dry. 

Artichoke bruschetta was ok, but mushy, salty, and not too impressive. 

Caprese bruschetta was tasty with the balsamic reduction... But I view that as something pretty hard to mess up. 

Callabrese pizza was OK, but the crust was both soggy and ridiculously tough at the same time. The portion under the toppings was incredibly soggy, while the portion without toppings was hard, and tasted \"stale\"... I noticed I wasn't the only person who left the crusts and didn't eat them. 

I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Sorry but this going to be dreadfully honest. Went for restaurant week and was disappointed. Had a salad that was suppose to have roasted beets, but they were straight from a can. Risoto was sticky and tasteless. Braised short rib was ok, needed salt. But the worst was the bread pudding. Who serves cold bread pudding. It was paisty and bland. Oh and 1988 called and wants their awful canned music back. 

On a positive note the gin martini was excellent."}
{"text":"Meh is right. I usually mesh with Yelpers but have to agree to disagree on this one. We were excited by reviews but disappointed by experience. 

STARTERS: Pretty sure I found the worst margarita in the world. Ever. It was bland and flavorless, literally like water. Hubs had the rhubarb drink and liked it. The fried olives were interesting but now that I've experienced will probably never need again. There was an abundance of olives but the bread and dip steal the show. Also had the bruchetta and pardon the 51% Italian in me for saying that SHORTRIBS do NOT belong on BRUCHETTA. It's called a sandwich and needs to be moved to that part of the menu. 

ENTREES in our party included margharita flatbread and chicken marsala. I felt like neither was to write home about, just average, so-so meal. 

DESSERT went with the pumpkin whoopee which had a lot going on on the plate: chai ice cream, pretty solid; pumpkin whoopee was good, but missed that certain something; with the highlight being a gingerbread something puree. Puree was a show stealer, rich in flavor but certainly not a standalone. Maybe serving it with shortbread cookies or something but way too much with everything else on that plate. 

My recommendation: This is one nook and cranny you may not need to explore. Price doesn't align with product and I think they're trying too hard to be different. There are too many great options in Phx to pay a premium for mediocre. Move on friend, move on."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  The wood fired pizza is yummy, too!  We arrived early for Sat dinner an were thrilled to get a table right away.  This place is definitely a \"must try\" when you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ordered the scallops($38) and poutine for an appetizer and was fairly unimpressed by both. The scallops were cooked well and seemed fresh but definitely lacked in seasoning. They could have benefited with more of a sauce. The white asparagus was undercooked and, again, lacked seasoning. Poutine was a big portion which is great to share but the gravy was a bit too salty. Everything is a bit overpriced compared to surrounding restaurants and there is a price discrepancy from their current menu and the one listed online on yelp."}
{"text":"I went to Nook Kitchen as it is close to my Office and opened quickly - it is going through a soft Opening and here is my review;

SERVICE - Excellent Service from the staff (Hostess, Servers, Bartenders, etc.) Prompt, courteous and offered suggestions

DECOR - Great Decor -  interior of restaurant is very nice.  Funny thing is the builders did not realize they put doors that open OUT towards the patio and placed a table right in front of one of the doors - maybe a slider would have been a better idea!  Also figure a door would have been placed by the corner as you need to enter the Hotel to get to the Restaurant - Hotel Lobby is Extremely Nice!

FOOD - Found the food to be okay - here is what I ordered;

1. Shrimp Coktail - Shrimp themselves were very Good, but the Cocktail Sauce had too much Lemon in it - considering it was served with two Lemon Wedges, I would have preferred to add my own instead of tasting mainly lemon - also prefer a little more heat - was nearly no spice at all.

2. Beer Braised Pork Butt Bruschetta (Half Order) - I wanted to order one of the Bruschetta choices and the Server recommended this one so I went with it.  The pork itself was Great, but the bread it was on was Mush/soft.  It literally tasted like I was eating an open faced sandwich on white bread - maybe this is part of the learning process, but the bread in a Bruschetta should be crispy! 

3. Meatball Sandwich with French Fries - Meatballs were very Good - Real Deal Cheese and Bread was similar to a Pita which I liked - disappointment here is the minimal amount of Sauce that was involved in the sandwich

PRICE - Total came to $41.00 without Tip - I had 5 Shrimp, Half order (2 pieces) of Bruschetta and a Meatball Sandwich with French Fries and an Unsweetened Tea.

It is a new place and normally I would not order Shrimp Cocktail, Bruschetta and a sandwich, but I wanted to try various options - I will try some other sandwiches and salads in the next months, but I am not rushing back to try them - the meal was okay and is Pricey for Lunch"}
{"text":"I was late to our happy hour.  Had to run home to let the fuzzy kids go outside before I could sneak out for HH.  :)  The parking lot has tons of cars, but I was lucky to get a spot right in front of the place.  It is a little place and cute.  The service was just SUPER slow.  

Ordered the Porco e Funghi was pretty good.  The crust was crispy but some of the crust was soggy when to get to the last few slices."}
{"text":"Been to the Arcadia location and of course loved it.  So since I was close by in downtown, thought it was be nice to enjoy good food.  This location is inside a Hilton hotel.  Nice place and you need to walk through the hotel lobby for restrooms.  

Shared an appetizer:  Chicken artichoke flatbread (grilled chicken, spinach, roasted garlic, and artichokes).  It was very good and too filling for me to order the main dish.  

The service was outstanding.  Never had to ask for a refill."}
{"text":"The food was great and the drinks were delicious but the best things about this restaurant were the service and the atmosphere. The woman that took care of us was amazing; she was funny and very personable. The outside patio was a great place to people watch on a warm evening. I will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"I have lived in the valley for 7 years. I have not had a pizza this good - ever. The atmosphere of the place is very relaxed. The bartenders are amazing and very personable. I live in Scottsdale but this place is going to bring me to Phoenix a lot more. I really like it here. I also had the chicken bruschetta and it was out of this world."}
{"text":"Had some time to kill before a meeting up the road, so we ducked into Nook for drinks and an early dinner.  Great little place.  Nice decor, friendly staff, great food!  It was happy hour so I had a glass of Cabernet and we ordered the hummus plate off the HH menu.  It was really good.  A nice combo of veggies, pita, hummus, and tzatziki, along with some fried chickpeas.  It was a great start to our meal.  We then shared the Giardino pizza.  It was fabulous!  Great crust, lots of veggies, and a modest amount of their house pulled mozzarella.  Delish!  Will definitely stop in again next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and both times were excellent. Everything on the plate, the flavors combined were awesome, cooked perfectly and they have gluten free options and can adjust some other dishes to suit those on gluten free diets. Beautiful setting inside and connected to a gorgeous historic hotel(walk through the hotel lobby on your way out) Servers super helpful, friendly, upbeat also. Good place for a date with your sweetie"}
{"text":"What a wonderful local restaurant. We went there for lunch and were delighted with the atmosphere and food. The dish that was our favorite was the halibut tacos. Our waiter Jorge was very attentive and helpful. The bread pudding dessert was tasty. Can't wait to go back again and try out some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"What?!  Nom, nom, nom. You talking to me?  What's that?  I came in here for a quick bite to eat during HH- no drinks and a chicken chopped salad w no dressing to keep it healthy?  What?  I'm still eating healthy- Tito's (vodka & tonic) has the lowest calories and carb if you're going to have a drink. No, really. 
What? This short rib bruschetta right in front of me full of delicate port reduction on top of a bed of mushroom purée?  Well, I'm getting my protein in. And the fried risotto rice ball that's rich and creamy with just the right hint of mozzarella in the center?  The waitress told the they were one calorie each. 
What?  I'm not hoarding my chunks of blue cheese and dipping them in my hard to resist blue cheese dressing. Hey, keep your fingers away from them!
That's how it goes sometimes, I go in to eat a simple meal and the menu looks so delectable that I have to just \"order a few more\" just for tasting. 
Good thing I had a few of my Elite Yelper friends with me to *sigh* share in the burden of tasting as we were in there celebrating Irene V.'s ROTD. And good thing as we ordered our way through the HH menu, the portions are the same as during regular hours but at about half the price cause I think by the time we were done, we might have ordered one of each item!
Be warned!"}
{"text":"Great little place for date night.  Good cocktails and great pizza.  We got the sausage and mushroom pizza and it was delicious- and I usually don't like sausage.  The cocktails were inventive.  I had the deconstructed mule and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. The happy hour menu offer's great prices. I had the Hummus Bruschetta which is a great combination. Chicken Salad was very comprehensive, both meals were delicious."}
{"text":"I went here for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend. We set up a reservations through Yelp and it was so easy! We got there early and were able to be seated right away. The food was amazing! He got pizza and I got the short rib. We also got the lemon olive oil ricotta cake and it was perfect! One of the best valentine days ever and it was definitely because of this restaurant. Also it is in a great location with lots of pretty hotels nearby to look at, and a lot of places to park. We will definitely be returning here again. Amazing service and even more amazing food!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service but way too expensive. I was shocked at the prices but than figured out it's a part of the hotel and it's a tourist trap. Plenty of better restaurants in the area that are cheaper."}
{"text":"Quality of food was great. Attention to detail to a specific salad order was not great but manager didn't hesitate to comp my salad. I would go back again"}
{"text":"Are here a couple of weeks ago. Had the lamb shank dinner. One word. AMAZING!  Appetizers and drinks were also delicious. Atmosphere and service were upscale. Also great bar for drinks and hanging out."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience this week with friends for dinner at Nook.  I was honestly blown away by the food and the service was great as well.  They have a fun cocktail list and great beer/wine menu.  The roasted olive appetizer was amazing.  We all chose different entrees and they were all delicious:  filet, scallops, pork chop and short ribs.  The pizzas looked incredible but we had no room!  Next time!"}
{"text":"Awsome pizza had the prosciutto pie and few beers at the bar on a Tuesday. No complaints."}
{"text":"Drinks are fabulous. 

Food orgasm. If you need one, come to #thenook. You will not be sorry. 
#mouthorgasm  

Enough said."}
{"text":"I love the nook and their pizza has me coming back over and over again. They have a spicy thinly sliced almost like a pepperoni but not and so tasty. I love the prosciuttos and argula pizza as well."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Their amazing due to their simple menu, service, and great atmosphere. Best place in the valley definitely. Ask to be seated in Ralph's section always the best!"}
{"text":"Dining here at the moment, and I must say that I am blown away by the simplicity of the decor, menu and style of service. Kayla, my sweet server was extremely, extremely knowledgable about the menu. I had ordered exactly what she had recommended (the Diavolo pizza and the Magician red blend -- both of which were absolutely divine!) Matt, whom I have just now learned is one of the owners, has approached my table 3 times within my dining experience and just like Kayla and the hostess (I am unsure of what her name is), is SO kind and sincere. Thank you, Nook, for a delicious dinner and a great display of genuine hospitality!"}
{"text":"Nook certainly lives up to it's name.  It's situated in a plaza and tucked in the middle of it.  Definitely a blink and you miss it type of place!  Went here for a business dinner and we were all extremely pleased and happy with the food!  We ordered everything from the poutine to several of the pizzas.  Just a couple times the service was not 100%, but pretty close.  We found the menu was decently priced, what you'd expect for fresh food.  

The atmosphere in here is very appealing; I love the coziness and rustic-ness of the place. Very relaxing.  While waiting for our party to arrive, we went early to catch the Happy Hour which was good as well. Bartender was very attentive.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why the ratings are so high, the pizza was ok ,wasn't the best but wasn't the worst,  toppings of my pizza was small , I ordered the one with clams toppings with bacon , salad was fresh but expensive, happy hour on Saturday is only until 6p.its loud if you come here on Saturday,  I won't be coming back here again just for pizza and salad"}
{"text":"This is such a gorgeous place to eat Downtown. Beyond the stunning decor that includes glamorous lighting fixtures and an insane gold art deco accent wall, Nook is home to the prettiest and tastiest charcuterie in AZ right now. It is generous, colorful and priced fairly. The bread that is served along with it is toasted yet chewy.. honestly so perfect. Fresh mozzarella, olives, dried apricot pieces and fig jam accompany the meats so well that I will visit again JUST for this menu offering. Well done!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great atmosphere. Food was wonderful! Chicken Marsala (no mushrooms) was amazing! We also tried the pizza, filet, and lamb which were each fantastic. Presentation was also wonderful! Owner came by and checked on us multiple times and was very nice!! He also treated us to one of their ooey gooey butter cakes (we came from out of town and he wanted us to try)! It was delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"amazing. The baked olives and the porco e funghi with sopressata and truffle oil are awesome."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Phoenix, hands-down.

We have been coming here since we moved to Phoenix in April and love it. The servers are knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. The wine list is excellent and if you are looking for something in particular just ask Matt their resident sommelier and barman.

You must try the arancini balls!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just an off night.  I ordered this through Postmates to the house.  Braised short rib, caprese bruscetta.  Bruscetta was good,  very small portion of two pieces, perhaps my fault for assuming an appetizer would encompass more than two pieces?   Short rib was dry, wasabi shallot accoutrement is really a swing and a miss.  Mashed potatoes were really decadent, artfully under seasoned which is a good call when paired with a short rib in my opinion, steamed veggie side also good.  Too bad the short rib couldn't keep par.  My search for decent food delivered in the desert continues."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant located on the corner of Monroe and Central in The Hilton Garden Inn Hotel. If it's a beautiful cool evening, ask to sit outside and watch the downtown Phoenix life. Service was awesome, the hostess greeted and smiled us when we came in, and our server was very attentive and kind! He gave great recommendations for food and wine, and never let our water or drink glasses get low. 
My boyfriend had the chicken marsala and I had the short ribs. Both dishes where very tasty and plated very well, with lots of great flavor. This place to go to for a nice date before an event or just a special evening with a loved one. I defiantly recommend stoping by for a drink, and I will defiantly be back to experience more of their menu."}
{"text":"What can I say?! I am seeing more and more restaurants pop up in Downtown Phoenix and I am loving it! When I heard about Nook I of course was excited since I just went and visited the other location.

We arrived about 830 on a Saturday night. Tons of traffic due to who knows what! Valet was full no problem so I parked around the block. Walking in the decor and ambience makes you feel comfortable. The colors vibrant and subtle.  I fell in love with the chair at our table,  I felt like a queen! 

The menu has all the same plus some new additions as well. I already knew to order a pizza from a previous visit in Arcadia. My boyfriend decided on the Diavolo. A red sauce pizza with basil and a somewhat spicy meat. Amazing! 

I ordered the Short Rib. The picture I have will show just how wonderful it was. The entree came with leek mashed potatoes and baby green beans. We shared the food and loved every bite! Compliments to the chef. We were checked on a few times and made sure we had everything we needed. 

We normally do not get dessert as we do not have room in our tummies, but a lovely old friend of my boyfriends came by and recommended the oooy gooey butter cake! Oh yeah! We made room for that for sure. All I can say is we are craving to go back very soon! 

Go by and support this place! It is connected to the new Hilton Garden on a Monroe. Check out the lovely patio or dine inside and enjoy a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"This place is inside the Hilton Garden Inn that  I stay at everytime I am on a business trip to Phoenix. Although they close early most week nights, for legitimate business reasons, you should definitely make time to visit this awesome little niche spot."}
{"text":"Awesome wine, and even better food. Came here with a buddy and sat at the bar, was greeted by a friendly bartender who took great care of us the whole night. We ordered a bottle of Pinot noir and even though they were out of the one on their menu they aye a back up (not sure of the name though). It tasted great. For appetizers we had  the arancini balls which were perfectly crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside and they were literally just out of the oven which made them even better. I also tried the the artichoke for an appetizer which was good but a big PIA to eat, but the sauce that came with it was amazing. For the main course I had the short rib which was cooked well, but honestly I think the sides were even better which were the green beans which had a garlicky and buttery taste (just how I like my green beans) and the mashed potatoes which were delicious as well. I would highly recommend this place for a chilled relaxed kind of night and will come here again and again."}
{"text":"I had a long week and I was happy it was Friday. I needed to go to happy hour - pronto. I decided to give Nook a try. 

Unfortunately, I didn't order their pizza because I had pizza the other day. I kind of regret it. When you notice that their menu consists of mostly pizza, you probably should get it. But I didn't. I just ordered off the happy hour menu - a glass of Cab, the Poutine, the Pork Butt Bruschetta, and the Chicken Chop salad. 

Everything was good for a happy hour thing and my partner and I practically devoured most of it. I think I'll be back for dinner and try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot. Service was quick. Food was good. They had a lot of dif salads that looked good. A little pricey though."}
{"text":"Chicken marsala is amazing!! Best I've ever had. Coming back --- for sure
Great place- ambience perfect."}
{"text":"Everything I had here was fabulous--right down to the nice folks at the table next to me. Great food, service, and atmosphere. I started with a fruity, crisp Riesling: Dr. Loosen, if you're into that. To eat, I had the arugula salad with CANDIED CASHEWS. Who candies cashews?! These guys, that's who. Then I had a pizza with apples, dates, and fennel. I traded the Gorgonzola for fresh mozzarella and it was heavenly. It was bigger than the plate it came on, and I was afraid I wouldn't finish it. Of course, I had to make myself stop, because I was full but still eating! Again, who puts dates and apples on pizza?! Again: the nook, that's who. Genius."}
{"text":"If you love Arancini Balls like my wife love balls, you will die for this place.  The happy hour menu is ridiculously good and criminally cheap.  A huge steamed burger (East Coasters) fries and a beer for $10.  Are you kidding me???  The Decor is hipster paradise, the hipsters are cool, inviting and gracious and the service is excellent.  Get your butt over here, you won't regret it!  Tip; ride your bike because you'll need to burn some calories when you leave."}
{"text":"Great service and Lamb Shank is huge! Best Savingon Blanc for $12. Excellent service. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Very light and crispy crust. Nick, our server, was top notch. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I love Nook. Got delivery through Postmates tonight and I was extremely happy with my Diavola pizza. It was cooked very well and I will absolutely be eating either at Nook or ordering delivery again in the future."}
{"text":"We took a friend here for her birthday and thoroughly enjoyed it! It's nice to see this area being revitalized. The aroma from the open front door out in to the parking lot is enough to fill the place with pedestrian traffic! It is a small affair and can be a tad warm when full but the food & service are perfect. We sat at the bar rather than waiting for a table and had several appetizers including the chicken chop (salad), hummus plate, langoustine and diavolo pizza. The pizza was my favorite. A thin, crunchewy crust with just the right amount of toppings. The spicy soppressata was a little too warm for my wife but I liked it. The hummus was very fresh, as were the veggies that came with it. The staff was attentive without being on top of you every moment. The owners were there and getting their hands dirty with their staff. You can tell they are a tight knit group that enjoys working with each other. They made a point to stop and talk with their customers and support the staff the entire time I was there. Finally, they gave my friend a free dessert for her birthday! The Affogato is a mix of lemon ice cream, chocolate crumble and a chocolate sauce with a shot of espresso on top. I tried it and it was awesome! Check this place out, but be prepared for a wait if you want a table on a busy night. It's great to know Phoenix is attracting and supporting establishments like Nook. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Love NOOK - great food (yummy pizzas/salads/apps), excellent drinks (try the mule!), and fabulous customer service (often you will even get a visit from the very nice owner just to check in on you).  I'd rather not give such a good review so I can keep this little gem my secret but that wouldn't be fair:) I must stop for lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"Awesome everything! Cocktails, food, and service was out of this world. Short rib, scallops, pizzas - amazing all around :)"}
{"text":"I came to Nook Tuesday for a work dinner for a large group. The décor of this place is absolutely adorable! They have an extensive wine and cocktail menu for all types of palettes. For my dinner I had the salmon with cauliflower mash and grilled squash. This is something I often make at home but they truly perfected it. The salmon was absolutely delicious, I wish I got their recipe! Our waitresses were also incredibly pleasant and always made sure we were attended too. I definitely recommend this place for a dinner if you're downtown."}
{"text":"Nook is absolutely fabulous!! I have been to the downtown Phoenix and Arcadia Nook and they are both incredible. I love the pizza and the olive appetizer is sooo yummy!!! Honestly anything that you get here, you will be impressed with"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend to try out.  Service was fast and friendly. We got a salad and a pizza to share.  Flavors were fresh and vibrant.  I will put this place on my spots to hit up in DTPHX."}
{"text":"The food is so delicious  best pizza I've ever had in my life! The short rib bruschetta was oh my gosh good and the grilled artichoke was delicious as well. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, start to finish the meal was perfect. Cocktails were unique and very tasty; I highly recommend the smoky mule. The only thing that tops the food and drinks is the service. The entire staff goes out of their way to make sure you have a great experience."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick dinner on our way to the airport;  we didn't want to leave! 
The food and service were exceptional!
The artichokes amazing, the pizzas made us feel as if we were dining in Naples and, the Nook spicy chicken, heavenly.   We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I think this place is just awesome. 

First the appetizers and bruschetta come in 1/2 order or full order- this to me is genius!!  I love having something small to start and having the option.  It also allows you to try more!  We ordered two half apps and a pizza and this was perfect for 2 people!

We started with the 1/2 order of Aranchini (3 pieces) - risotto was perfectly cooked and just the right amount of cheese mixed in and fried to perfection.  The pomodoro sauce was a great accompaniment with a balsamic reduction - delicious!! Second appetizer we had the chicken artichoke bruschetta - this combination was so good and perfectly warm. 

For the pizza we ordered the Calabrese - full of flavor and each item complimenting the other from the sausage and caramelized onions to the chili peppers and cheese! Definitely recommend!! 

Service was great- waters were always full and checked on us just the right amount of times and was quick to order (we were hungry) :) 
Atmosphere - always a 10 love the space and decor!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem for sure!  Everything from the service, atmosphere, food innovation and taste, home run!  The owner personally introduced himself to us, the service (front and back of the house) was educated, informative, attentive, and passionate.  Very cool, romantic or lounge type vibe to the area.  Food was very creative.  Pizzas are outstanding.  The attention to details in flavor profile was on point too.  I had the chicken marsala and that extra flare of Grand Marnier in there adding the citrus notes was on point!  I'm scared to tell the world about this place b/c I want to be able to get a table any time I want!  :)"}
{"text":"Arancini. Amazing. Risotto and mozzarella-what's not to like? Great relaxing atmosphere, good selection odd wines. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant! I always visit it when im down on business. As a Canadian I give the poutine five stars...go crazy and add the short ribs AND an egg... heaven. The pizza is pretty awesome too. I always end up there on Tuesdays and the live music is a really nice touch."}
{"text":"We told our server we had a show in 90 minutes and she made sure we were done on time.  Good food and service.  Booze a little pricy(reason for 4 stars).  I loved my chicken Marsala.  My wife described the spaghetti bolognese as very light on taste.  We both thought the pasta noodles were excellent."}
{"text":"this place has everything I like l going for it yummy food, good drinks, reasonable prices, traffic but not craziness and solid service 

everything I have come I always ask why I don't come more. tonight's visit included a diavola the porkchop and kronenbourg all were well prepared and tasty 

will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"I like this place because of its outstanding ambiance inside. They offered great variety of dishes which are so delightful. Enjoyed a lot with their Salmon dish, it was full of flavor and was cooked pretty well.  Margherita pizza was also super great  and so with the Chicken Marsala. It was a great decision coming here!"}
{"text":"My family really loved this restaurant.  The restaurant itself was small and hip.  The food was fantastic. My wife had the Arugula salad and loved it.  The rest of the family stole a few bits of her salad.  We all shared a Diavolo and Porco e Funghi pizza as well a chicken marsala dish. The pizzas were great - loved the crust and the spicy pepperoni.  The chicken was very tasty. The best chicken marsala I have ever had.   We walked out all very happy that we found a new place."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and it seems to have become one of our go to places for a casual, no drama, delicious food evening.  Have tried all of their pies and most of their entrees an appetizers  and nothing was sent back.  Bar pours a generous drink.  Hostesses (they seem to disappear like old girlfriends) are sometimes a bit ditzy but that somehow adds to the charm.  They prove that sometimes the simpler, the better.  Will come back many more times.  Maybe I'll see you there!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey for what you get but over all the food wasn't bad. Nice atmosphere and  attentive staff. Good cocktail menu and extensive wine list."}
{"text":"Although the service was charming and ambiance lovely - the food was disappointing. The roasted olive appetizer and wine selection was good. Our three entrees and two salads were not good. Pizza was cooked to a frisbee-hard disk; fra diavolo
pasta was mushy and shrimp fishy; chicken pasta was a hard balls of stuck- together noodles and rubber bird meat. If we had time to spare we would have sent all three entrees plus the two salads back to the kitchen. So many choices in downtown Phx - skip this one!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is always on point, the food is \"make that face like you could die right now and be perfectly ok with it\"  good. In fact my husband made that face last night over the Chicken Marsala. I in turn make that face when I eat their Diavolo Pizza or their Pasta Crepe. Excellent wine selection and the feel of a cozy neighborhood joint round this out to being one of my favorite restaurants in the valley!"}
{"text":"From when you walk in the door you can see why one would call this restaurant \"Nook\". Dark shabby chic interior was a nice compliment to a semi-gloomy day like today was. The menu is small featuring pizzas, salads, bruschetta, & chicken marsala. We ordered a half arugula salad to start and our very friendly server brought it out promptly (about 5 min max). It's was fresh & well put together which was expected for the $7 cost. We had also ordered the prosciutto pizza which also came out in a timely manner. It was just crispy, light and topped with fresh arugula. Great job Nook! You have impressed me -- a server at an Italian restaurant-- 5 stars would be earned if the prices were a little more friendly."}
{"text":"The service was good, the ambiance lovely, and the food quite enjoyable. Not a fan of the craft cocktail I ordered, but the wine pairing (suggested by our waiter) was excellent. We ordered the lamb shank and the Chicken Marsala. 

The lamb was well-seasoned and tender... could have used some green veggies perhaps as a side to boost the health factor and overall profile. Or alternately, it would be nice to have an option to order the lamb in a stew (or with a side of the sauce the lamb is cooked in) for a juicier experience. 

The Chicken Marsala was the star; actually the best we've had in the valley. It needed more liquid or sauce, but as far as the flavor, it was impressive. Delicate, balanced and well-crafted... and just enough sweetness. The mushrooms and Marsala wine elements came through nicely. This is a must-order when you visit.

I should also mention that dessert was wonderful - a chocolate Budino (sort of a creamy custard or pudding). It was rich and moist and decadent... didn't get too much of the Espresso flavor though. Recommend this with a vanilla ice cream instead of the lemon it came with.

Bravo, Nook!"}
{"text":"First time at Nook kitchen, great place to start ur night out, excellent service and food. I couldn't ask for more, and my friend thinks the owner is hot!"}
{"text":"Chicken Marsala to die for!  As a fine diner who is not easily impressed, the Nook's signature dish was amazing :)  Although a little pricey as a stand-alone dish with no side, the quality and mouth watering Marsala sauce made it worth the drive from North Scottsdale. Will definitely be back as I know I will be craving it again..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great food and atmosphere in downtown Phoenix, look no further. Even better, if you have an event to attend at either Comerica Theater or Talking Stick Resort, you can valet park your car right out front for $12 (they're attached to the Hilton Garden Inn), then dine and walk to your event. So easy! First off, we were greeted with warm friendly smiles and seated and served right away. The food, incredible...the personal size pizzas were generous in size and delicious, but...the crust is the real stand out here! I'll go so far as to say the best pizza I've ever had (see photos). The martinis were smooth, the Espresso perfect, and home-made Limoncello not to be missed. Bravo Nook Kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"The service was very good! We ordered some small plates as a group and they paced everything really well. The mela e dattero pizza was really delicious and perfectly made. The aranchini could have used more sauce (maybe a dipping sauce). The chicken artichoke bruschetta was really tasty but a little on the soggy side. The chicken chopped salad was very good. Overall we were really happy with our dinner!"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. And I don't use that word frequently. 

We ordered the short rib bruschetta and pollo something? pizza. Both were out of this world. I turned to my girlfriend half way through the meal and told her I could see us becoming regulars here. 

While the menu was a little small for my liking, I'd be willing to bet every dish would be perfectly executed. 

Our service was great as well and my date and I really enjoyed the place, will be sure to come back."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait! Service was great. The entire family loved their meals. Everything was tasty, hot and well-prepared.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Eh. Nothing special.
My salad was one of those annoying deconstructed ones which are super annoying to eat. They also give you a side of dressing that's probably 3 teaspoons for a pound of salad. Therefore, you keep having to ask for more dressing - which is annoying and ridiculous."}
{"text":"As good as we could get! 

Visiting Phoenix from New York for a conference, this place was close to our hotel and had good reviews. It was relatively empty, but I guess that's to be expected for 9pm on a Sunday night. 

We got the arancini for an app and split two pizzas for dinner. They were excellent! I even ate the leftovers in the morning. I hate leftovers! We might even go back! 

We just got wine and whisky but they were both good selections. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This place! We had an amazing amazing experience here tonight. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"DON'T RIDE YOUR BIKE HERE. The manager was out front as he watched us park our bikes. Later after dinner we walk out and find that one of them is missing with the locks cut. We go back in to consult the manager and staff and they all say so sorry that is a vey common problem here. So we are flabbergasted that the manager would not tell us not to park our bikes outside of his restaurant when clearly all the employees and guest find that it's a common occurrence. He manages dilly dally, and literally was walking back and forth the entire time! You wonder how in the hell he didn't noticed when he went in and out of the door at least 5 times back and forth. Kinda makes you question weather he was in on it or not. Either way he had a piss poor way of handling the situation."}
{"text":"We dined here for the first time last night and it was fantastic all around! The service was excellent and the food was incredible! Really appreciated the management presence and how much he assisted every department in the restaurant. He seems like a strong leader. We will definitely be back! Great ambiance, personable staff, and delicious food."}
{"text":"A very fine eating establishment with excellent service and food. The ambience is too dark."}
{"text":"the bartender has a fantastic attitude and a darn good sense of humor. He asked me if I wanted to sit at the bar since I was alone. his name is Louis I said no thanks since I've been in front of a large group speaking all day. I wanted a cozy table all to myself. His sense of humor and generous spirit had me laughing and somewhat... theres a good place in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, solid ambiance, excellent service, tasty drink selection and a dinner menu to die for.

Try the Calabrese Piazzo, perfect spice, sweet chillies, three cheeses and spicy sausage."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Server was very nice.  She explained everything well, and very attentive without being over bearing. Good atmosphere for a business meeting or just dinner."}
{"text":"Definitely a good spot! Really great food, attention to detail, and solid bar. All staff are equally as positive."}
{"text":"I came here for birthday lunch. The service was incredible, but not as amazing as the food! Starters are amazing, greens are perfect. Had the chicken chop. The pizza was just right. Not too thin or thick and a crust wasn't too heavy. Had the prosciutto pizza. Great experience and the server ralph really added value to the experience. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Overall rating: 3.5 Stars
In short, the food was good but a few mishaps making A-OK+.

After hearing good things about Nook, I was really excited to try them. Then, I received a giftcard and that sealed the deal. The first time my husband and I stopped by, they were closed for a holiday/vacation break. Disappointed, we decided we would try them some other time.
 
The next time, a few months later, we arrived around 4:30pm. As we walked in, they informed us that the grill wasn't working - they could only make a few select appetizers and flatbreads. They reassured that it would be fixed shortly and we ordered the arancini appetizer to tide us over. 

To drink, I ordered a Moscow Mule. Halfway through my mule, our waiter informed us that the grill was working so we ordered a pizza and my husband ordered the special - a prime rib with mashed potatoes. From where we were sitting, I could see the pizza being prepped. When the pizza was done, it sat for a bit and several of the waitstaff walked by. Eventually, our waiter grabbed the pizza and delivered it. The pizza itself was delicious and flavorful. The crust was crispy and fluffy at the same time. Soon after, the prime rib arrived. My husband enjoyed it; he ate every bite. I tried a few bites and it was good, but I thought the prime rib was missing something. More salt? More herbs? Not sure, but it was pretty plain. The mashed potatoes were well seasoned though. 

When the check came, I inserted my giftcard and my credit card (just in case we went over the gift amount). When the check came back, I saw that the entire bill was charged to my CC. I had to alert the waiter and he apologized, saying he didn't see the giftcard and went back to un-charge my CC and apply the giftcard. He informed me I might see a double transaction but it would clear in a few days and again apologized for the mix up. 

Overall, I was very glad I had a giftcard so I could try Nook. I probably won't be back, since it isn't in my neighborhood. However, if you are in the neighborhood, check it out."}
{"text":"This is Nook's second location, located within the Hilton Garden Inn in Downtown Phoenix on Monroe Street. I originally reviewed their Indian School spot and gave them a solid three stars due to having respectable but somewhat pricey foods, with lots of hits and misses with their menu. And honestly, in terms of the overall experience, I'd say that this location is more or less the same. The restaurant itself has a cool setup and unlike the spot on Indian School, also features an outdoor patio. 

We started with a half-order of their fig bruschetta, which includes fig jam, prosciutto, asparagus, and a bit of goat cheese. This item has always been consistently good, while their polpetinne (fried risotto balls) were fine as well.

We've experimented with their menu before by trying their bolognese and being disappointed. I assume their chicken marsala is still very good, while I'd imagine that their poutine (gravy fries) also delivers. We decided to skip these options, however, and just get a diavolo pizza.

Nook's pizza is a bit weird. Ingredients are fine and crust has always had solid flavor, but their pizzas are always served incredibly dry and floury, in stark contrast to what we're used to at most places. I guess it's more of a subjective thing, but I never find myself to be impressed as much as I wish I could be.

For dessert, their options are a bit different than what we remembered. We decided to order their buttercake, which seemed more like a cheesecake than anything else. The dish heavily incorporates graham crackers, including a ganache and an actual miniature graham cracker itself. The dessert was good, but if you're familiar with buttercake, you might be a little thrown off.

Our server was incredibly slow - and I mean painfully slow in comparison to the usual quick service we receive at Nook. The place wasn't very busy for a Saturday night, so I'm not sure what that was about.

Prices are a bit high, which I've never felt are fully justified. Overall, I'd still recommend Nook as a place to try out. Although the food isn't quite as impressive as I think it could potentially be, it definitely has its fair share of fans."}
{"text":"After dining here on four separate occasions, my feelings on Nook are somewhat mixed - which I guess makes me kind of the odd one out here.

The décor and atmosphere of the restaurant is very hip and relaxed. I like the big booths, provided you're lucky enough to get one. As another reviewer pointed out, it's difficult to recommend items, because their online menu is outdated. What you see on their website isn't necessarily what they might be currently offering.

I really like their fig bruschetta, which consists of fig paste, prosciutto di parma, goat cheese, and asparagus. We've had some pretty dull bruschettas recently and this was clearly the way that it should be done. 

As for pizzas, we've tried several, with the margherita, calabrese, and diavolo being the most notable. Their margherita was kind of unusual, looking and tasting more like a traditional cheese pizza based on how it was made (see pics). The calabrese and diavolo were both fairly decent representations. Overall, the pizza was acceptable, albeit more on the drier and \"flourery\" side than what we're accustomed to. I wouldn't quite put it in the same league as the bigger names in Phoenix. They do offer up a decently flavored crust, however.

Their best offering, however, is their nookerdoodle dessert. Think snickerdoodle and ice cream combined and you'll have a general idea of what it's like. Although it apparently disappears and reappears from the menu at unpredictable times, so you might get stuck with an affogato or peanut butter pie - not that there's anything wrong with that. 

Some other notable mentions include the poutine french fries with a fried egg added. I'd never had fries drenched in gravy before, but the combination actually works. Be warned that the portion is extremely large and will fill you up fairly quickly if you're not careful. Half-order is an option if needed.

We were pretty disappointed in the bolognese in comparison to some of the other places we've had it. The sauce itself didn't seem as complex as the menu described, despite a slight spice. One whole lot of meat sauce and not enough pasta, although once again, the portion was pretty generous. I saw some pictures where it looked much better than the one we received. We were also a bit underwhelmed with the flavor of their filet when we decided to give it a try. On a more recent visit, we really liked their chicken marsala, which includes some exceptionally great mushrooms. It's truly just hits and misses all around with Nook.

I guess we might return eventually, as they still have many interesting things on the menu that might be worth experimenting with. I do feel that their prices are a bit pompous, however. Even if you don't drink, two people can easily run up a pretty big bill. I have no issue with this, but the food here isn't really superior to what you'd get at alternative \"modern Italian\" restaurants.

With so many hits and misses, my feelings will remain mixed and I can't bring myself to give them anymore than a solid three stars."}
{"text":"Good reviews in general, my experience not so.   

They had run out of IPA after i had ordered one, they only had a few bottles besides that.  

I asked the waiter what he recommended, he rattled off a pizza with a few toppings that sounds good, so i said \"let's do it\".  When i got the bill it was and additional $3 for truffle oil, $3 for something else and they added $3 for something my wife had asked for as well.  I'd by happy to pay for it if they told me about it.  Food was OK besides that.  2 pizzas and a beer for $50 after tip, try somewhere else. I won't go back with so many options in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I recently visited Phoenix and stayed at the Hilton Hotel. After my work meeting went back to my room and decide to order food from this place. I had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo and a side salad. The salad was plain no flavor and lacked dressing. The Shrimp was over cooked and it's tasted like rubber. The linguini tasted rancid, nothing special about the sauce. I literally could not continue on eating the rancid taste the linguini had. Keep in mind this plate cost $27 and only included three shrimps. I could careless for the price, but at least focus on the taste. I will avoid this place at all cost when visiting Phoenix. Just horrible!!!"}
{"text":"We wandered in and it was amazing!! The food was delicious and the staff was so nice. We had a few drinks and James the bartender put up with our banter. The manager, Cory, was so welcoming and made our visit so fun!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for an It Works event, we ended up at the Nook two nights in a row. Food was phenomenal, service was superb, atmosphere was great. Definitely will come back the next time we're in AZ! Nick and Margaret were very hospitable. 
Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome wine list & extremely friendly staff!! Highly recommend!! Nick, the GM knows how to make friends quickly!"}
{"text":"Great food & service! We went there for bday celebration so we had a chance to share a few dishes. For starters we had the poutine and we added short ribs to it....AMAZING! We also had the Arancini which was crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Birthday gal really enjoyed the Fig Bruschetta. I on the other hand was in love with the Giardino pizza and as recommended by our waiter, I added sausage and truffle oil to the thin crust pizza. The pizza was definitely worth the calories and carbs! They too serve gluten free pizza. We had the Affogato for dessert....yummy soft chocolate chip cookie layered with ice cream and shot of espresso...very interesting combo."}
{"text":"This a great place!!! Went in for lunch during a break in our conference at the convention center. Service was great, we needed to get in and out within an hour and it was done. I ordered the Monroe Burger. The meat was tender and full of flavor, I had to struggle to get in my mouth, but well worth it. Hard to find because it was inside a hotel. Great for lunch, great food, nice decor and great service! Wholeheartedly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around to go with great happy hour. 4 dollar Tito's is a can't miss till 6 PM. Very cool spot"}
{"text":"Talk about an uncomfortable experience!  We went to Nook this weekend and I think it's safe to say that this is the last time we will be visiting this establishment.  We decided to pop in for a cocktail and pizza, so we sat at the bar and had one of the owners wait on us.  By his tone and conversation, it was blatantly obvious that he did not want to be there and couldn't wait to close up and go home.  He was not friendly nor helpful and overall the whole service was really uncomfortable.  That combined with the fact that our pizza (the Giardino ) was just meh on flavor really put a big damper on the evening.  

It's too bad because we've come in several times before and had decent food and service, but this experience really left us with a sour taste for all that is Nook."}
{"text":"I ordered a funghi pizza and it was pretty good. The environment was nice as well. It was a great place to meet up with my friend and catch up."}
{"text":"So impressed with the Nook! Booked a reservation here for my birthday and got great hospitality and food. Ambiance was perfect for a night out. Even got a visit from the bar manager who explained the origins and plant derivations in their tequilas as well as tasted a few samples. Only thing short of giving 5 stars was the food. The bruschetta, which came highly recommended btw, was cold and the bread wasn't toasted as much as I'd prefer. Also, the price for 4 small pieces seemed a bit steep to me ($16). The pizza was tasty but not the best. Their butter cake dessert was delicious, however and my friends enjoyed their salads. Overall, would definitely return!"}
{"text":"One of our group picked the restaurant out from a list & the 4 of us headed over on a Friday night. It was early so we didn't think we needed reservations. Well, this is a VERY popular restaurant, but they couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. The hostess was gracious & gave us a perfect table. When 2 more members of our group showed up, they didn't complain, but went out of their way to seat them with us & make them feel welcome. Besides the wonderful ambiance, THE FOOD IS INCREDIBLE!!! I won't say we licked our plates, but there wasn't much left as those plates headed back to the kitchen :)  And, finally, if you get to pick your server, go with COREY! He was friendly, charming & professional & added to the fun evening that we had. I just wish we were staying longer so we could go back!"}
{"text":"yea this place rocks!  good beer, good food. Fresh local ingredients."}
{"text":"I would definitely go here again. The service was a little slow but the food was awesome, drinks were good! I had the fig appetizer, the meat and cheese platter, and artichoke hearts. I also had the mule reconstructed, I would highly recommend this drink!"}
{"text":"We find our way back to Nook, the food is all very well done.  Comfy booths and atmosphere. The bar stools are comfy too but, it could use a bit of visual interest on the wall behind the bar.  Over all, the place is well run, food good and we like the staff."}
{"text":"First time visiting the downtown location and I only have great things to say about this place. I started my lunch with the Short Rib Bruschetta & Chicken Artichoke Bruschetta, both were out of this world. The flavors in these are amazing! My entree was the Meatball sandwich that comes on flatbread, which is a great option over any other bread. I will be making my way back for lunch and dinners soon!"}
{"text":"The only thing I'm unhappy about is that is took me so long to try this place! The staff is really friendly and laid-back so it's fun to sit at the bar. The food is great and they have really good happy hour selections. The hummus plate is my favorite - not the standard, boring, dried-out pita that you usually get. Lots of fresh veggies, tahini, and chickpeas.  We plan to become regulars!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Friendly staff and hip vibe! Excellent food. We started with the arugula salad (I would have had multiple plates of it)...both my husband and I licked our plates clean. It comes with veggies, candied cashews (), and dried apricots with a lemon dressing. VERY tasty. To follow, we ordered a Gluten-Free Diavolo (Spicy Salami) pizza to share. We nearly fought over the last piece. I highly recommend this little \"Nook\" in Arcadia. You're sure to love it."}
{"text":"There is great potential at this place however the service lacks.  Food came out cold and we asked to get fixed, it was like we causing a problem.  We didn't get out water refilled.  For the money it cost to have dinner, I would ha e expected better."}
{"text":"We visited after an AZ wine tasting event in Phoenix; the wines we had here were much better than anything we tasted during the day!  But maybe that's to be expected.  Between the Madness and Cures blend and the Jelly Jar Zin, Jelly Jar was the better.

...what was unexpected was the eggplant Napoleon.  Fantastic stack of breaded and fried eggplant, shuffled with cheese and a light sauce.  Wow, that was good.  As was the riff on the traditional caprese salad with melted house-made mozzarella... wow that was good too! The strangely-named ooey gooey buttercake was a nice collection of wonderful tastes.  

Very convenient downtown location if you're staying in a hotel there.  Also, none of the arrogance of a different, not-to-be-named downtown Phx butcher location!

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Met with Linda W. at Nook yesterday- it was both our first time there.  Sat at one of the circular half-booths that line the wall, at which one end terminates at a wine cellar and the other at the entrance.  The noise level was jarring at first, and made me wish we'd kept the initial offering of a booth closer to the entrance (less noisy), but after a few minutes' of adjustment, our central booth with a great view of the bar and kitchen just opposite was a nice choice.  There is a HUGE step up to get into the booth (about eight inches), so be careful as you step down.  I was wearing a mini-skirt and thought I could just slide off the seat onto the floor, but I forgot about all of that space...  When I come back to Nook, I won't be wearing a mini-skirt!  :)

Our server Alice was very personable and easily shared her faves when prompted.  I commented that she knew \"her stuff,\" and she quickly came back with \"except about the cornstarch,\" referring to the queries I had regarding certain menu items.  Now, onto our happy hour selections:

Linda ordered a $2 pint of Kronenbourg 1664, a pale lager made in Strasbourg, France.  It smelled fruity, which I welcomed, but it had enough of a hoppy flavor for me to dislike.  However, Linda liked it a lot.  She ordered the $5 Poutine, which consisted of house-cut fries, mozzarella curds, and beef gravy (made with cornstarch) and added a fried egg for an extra $2.  If you are part of a group of three or more, I suggest to get TWO fried eggs added!  We didn't have the problem of very soggy fries due to the beef gravy arriving in a separate bowl. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=nz1KtnNBoqgYiwokAbqKKQ#nz1KtnNBoqgYiwokAbqKKQ  Her other selections were the $5 Caprese bruschetta, which I didn't try (I'm avoiding inflammatory foods, such as tomatoes), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=Ujg_pGder-78HkVW2ZYPTA#Ujg_pGder-78HkVW2ZYPTA and the $5 Arancini, which were mozzarella and red pepper risotto balls, battered and fried, and placed on a bed of marinara sauce and balsamic drizzle.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=LdcmR5wLzqm1eyno_g38_A#LdcmR5wLzqm1eyno_g38_A  I said the heck with my rice allergy and tried one and found it mild and creamy, with a nice aroma from the red bell peppers.  Glad I tried it!

Since I didn't enjoy the Kronenbourg sample Alice brought me, I asked for a glass of the 10 Span Pinot noir, which was drier than I prefer, but paired alright with the Beer-braised pork butt bruschetta; That is, until I later sampled the 10 Span Pinot gris, which made for a heavenly match with said app.  The pulled pork came with a \"secret BBQ sauce,\" which was slightly sweet and more importantly, free of corn syrup and mustard, two ingredients that keep me from ordering anything that usually comes with BBQ sauce.  Wait till you take a bite of the pork and coleslaw... oh my goodness!  The sourness from the coleslaw cuts the sweetness of the sauce and makes the app so much fun to eat.  Better than foreplay, I tell ya!  ;) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=xTAc8Lwz804Do8tdHQj9xg#xTAc8Lwz804Do8tdHQj9xg  The $7 Fig bruschetta was very good, arriving with smoked prosciutto, goat cheese, and an asparagus spear, all sprinkled with herbs.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=l9TYtf4Or2WEOr369_zJFQ#l9TYtf4Or2WEOr369_zJFQ  Order this if you want to keep it light, yet tasty.  

The piece de resistance for me was the $8 Bread & butter bread pudding, which came with an apple-cranberry compote and caramel ice cream on top, a Tracey Dempsey creation. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=GLY1jPWqO5mH9uSUIsAHsA#GLY1jPWqO5mH9uSUIsAHsA  The compote I could do without, as I found it to be too sour, but the caramel ice cream and warm bread pudding combo was orgasmic!  I even had a spoonful of cold bread pudding leftovers this morning and was still amazed by the flavor and textures.  The flavor was eggy, which made me think this could make for a great French toast (too bad Nook doesn't offer breakfast service), but what took this bread pudding over the top for me was the tres leches flavor of the custard.  I will most certainly order this dessert again!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=ivZlqH9o6nDnSu7PC3U-zw#ivZlqH9o6nDnSu7PC3U-zw

Kudos to Nook for the delightful flavors and laid-back, yet sexy atmosphere, and to Alice for great service!"}
{"text":"I was out doing retail therapy with a girlfriend and we mosey into this restaurant. The service was impeccable & the happy hour is everyday from 3-6pm. The restaurant could add a few more small plates selection and up their wine quality yet      the dishes were reasonably priced. 

The Arancini (fried mozzarella/risotto) is a must try! Aside from the temperature being a tad warm, this place is worth a second visit!"}
{"text":"Rude, unedible, and made us wait an hour in  an empty restaraunt, we did have the time to kill, cuz we came early before the show we were there to see, shame Yelp can't give 0 stars, The worst.

We enjoyed the Irish pub across the street!  We usually spend 100 plus at Hiro sushi scottsdale, Ruch chris Scottsdale, and I worked for tips my entire life in show biz.  Ashley served us at the Irish pub, we spent under 28 bucks, and tipped 20! That's just how we roll, but never at the Nook again!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and also impress. Quality is the word that first comes to mind. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow, our first time here and the ambiance, the service, and the food was absolutely amazing. Shrimp Fra Diavlo was perfect-spicy and the fresh made pasta was to rave for!!  We'll be back!!  No doubt!"}
{"text":"Well I was here a long time ago and today found my way back by purposefully driving in the direction I remembered. Anyhow I'm here and loving it. The minute you walk in, pizza is the aroma and then you must order a pizza :) we also had the rib bruschetta which was perfect in 1/2 order.  Service is perfect, attentive but not annoying. Great artsy loungy atmosphere too. Booth sitting is the best."}
{"text":"This place is cute and small but has great simple decor and awesome food.

We started withe the arancini to start and it was filled with gooey cheese and had a crunchy outside...I could probably eat a million of those delicious little balls. The marinara sauce was delicious as well -its the simple things that can make anything better. 

We then had the ribeye and the calabrese pizza with a side salad. The greens were really basic but fresh and crunchy with yummy veggies mixed with a very lemony vinaigrette. The pizza was delicious- the crust itself was garlicy and perfectly crunchy. The fresh pulled mozzarella was amazing and gooey and creamy. The sausage was perfect with the garlic and caramelized onions. Boyfriends ribeye was delicious and the gorgonzola risotto was amazing. It had a great saffron rice taste at the beginning and then the aftertaste was the tart yummy gorgonzola. Our one complaint about it was the platting. It was served in a bowl with the big ribeye on top and risotto and veggies on the bottom. It wasn't that pretty, which didn't matter because the dish was awesome but it also wasn't very functional for that piece of meat. It made it hard to cut the meat on top of the risotto and then you had to literally dig the veggies out. So hopefully someone sees this and can take it into consideration.

We didnt have any room for dessert but it all looked awesome. Their happy hour has a great menu and great prices. I think this place will be a once in a while for a full dinner but  we both agreed we would add this to our list of places to go for happy hour. You can beat it."}
{"text":"I can't say enough nice things about this restaurant! We sat outside under the string lights on a perfect night in Phoenix and it was an incredible experience. The service was attentive, polite, and quick, which truly made a huge difference. The food was great as well and came out in a timely manner. They have extensive alcohol options as well with wine, beer, and cocktails. Centrally located and easy to find! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"While working the Final Four downtown, I finally had a chance to check this place out a couple times. Both times were the pizza as I was not in the mood for an entree. The prosciutto pizza was OK, I have had better. The quattro formaggio pizza was outstanding though! Service was decent. I would return if in the area again and try one of the entrees next time!"}
{"text":"We didn't have the full dining experience because we ordered room service at the Hilton Garden Inn, but the gentleman who took our order had personality for days and made the experience pleasant. Our food was ready quickly and arrived hot and fresh. We devoured the diovala pizza and enjoyed the fresh basil and spicy meat. Can't wait to try the full experience next time but if you are looking for tasty thin crust pizza, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I'm a vegetarian.

As a vegetarian,  I was not impressed. I ordered the hummus bruschetta, and arancini appetizer.  Neither was novel and both were bland in savory tastes and salt.  I also felt like it was overpriced.   My husband ordered the salmon which he said was a bland pseudo Asian take on fish. Overall just really unimpressed.  Why is this place rated so high??

Side note:  staff/service was pleasant."}
{"text":"I used  go to the Arcadia location quite a bit when I lived in the area. I went back after a hiatus and it was still an amazing time.

I like to sit at the bar because the bartenders are usually pretty entertaining.  The gluten free crust they serve this better than others I have tried. The head chef Nick is also very accommodating. He was trying out a new dish and gave away samples...  after several years, I'm still a fan"}
{"text":"Nook: a corner or recess, especially one offering seclusion or security. (From Merrium-Webster)

This restaurant is quite the cozy little spot, just like a nook! We came here during happy hour and indulged in a discounted appetizer and pizza. We had the poutine with egg, and the Giardino pizza.

The poutine was a heavenly concoction of mozzarella curds, gravy, and perfectly crisp fries. It was my favorite of the two items I had. The mozzarella curds were fresh and soft, with gravy that complimented the fries and cheese well. I liked how the gravy wasn't super salty which allowed for a better balance of flavors. The egg on top provided some extra creaminess and the runny yolk was great with the fries. During happy hour (Daily from 4-6 PM) this dish and other appetizers are $3 off.

The pizza had a thin crispy crust with a lot of fresh vegetables on top. I would have liked some more caramelized onion on it to balance out the rest of the savory flavors though.

Service was good and drinks were refilled as needed.

I'd come back to try more appetizers during happy hour and also to see how their entrees are."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food!  Atmosphere is awesome.  Ate way too much!   Im heading back tomorrow"}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience. 
When we first sat down and we're given menus I had a nice case of sticker shock.
The entry in yelp had two dollar signs, I feel like this is quite incorrect.
While the service was excellent, in my opinion the food was not worth the price.
I ordered pizza that was average, nothing to write home about. Another person in my party ordered the short ribs entree which was cooked and presented nicely, but it was very bland. The staff tried to remedy this for us by bringing some au jus but it didn't help. Then the waiter brought us the appetizer version of the short ribs which was better. 
Takeaway: amazing service, average pricey food."}
{"text":"Surprisingly solid for hotel food. I walked in at a quiet time and got served very promptly. Salad was delicious, well-presented and more importantly had fresh and flavorful ingredients without a huge amount of sugary dressing."}
{"text":"I give this place 4.5 stars. We came here on a Friday night and got seated without a wait. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. The decor and vibe were right up our alley!  Our server recommended the Thai cocktail and it was delish! We also enjoyed the arancini app and had the special pasta dish. We shared a pizza, which was very good, but we both felt there are other places in the Valley with better pizza. I'll qualify that with the fact we only tried one here, so I don't think it's a totally fair judgement.  We'd definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"So... run don't walk to this quaint local bar and eatery that has delicious food and a great happy hour.  I stumbled upon this urban and modern, but comfortable establishment Thursday, March 27th.  Ready for a drink and bite to eat, this place delivered that and more.  We started with a \"lite beer' Kronenbourg 1664 for um, $2.00-Yes, $2.00!  Moved on to the bruschetta (beer braised pork butt) and it was great, then we tried the Arancini (risotto balls) even better!  We were getting full but everyone was getting a pizza so we decided to try the Margherita pizza and it was heaven.  The chicken chopped salad was awesome as well.  Can't rave more about this place.  Please check them out... they will be adding outdoor seating by the summer and I can't wait to sit outside by the fountain and try some of their other menu items!  Our server Ralph was very informative and the owner stopped by to check on us as well.  What a great place... we'll be back-soon!"}
{"text":"Ate here on new years eve. Had a great lamb shank, my girlfriend had the scallops...both were awesome as were the grilled artichoke and arancini appetizers. Jason was our server and he did a great job. He knew his wine and was able to articulate on our choice. Nice job Nook!"}
{"text":"I haven't had many dining experiences that make me go \"Wow\"

That being said, Nook is a definite WOW. Our service was incredible. Having worked in restaurants I am relatively critical of the service and we were extremely well taken care of from start to finish. 

The food was awesome. The first words that come to mind are Italian Chic. Great conversation food and the pizza oven behind the bar adds a cool element to the place. The pulled pork bruschetta were tasty but small. Loved the charcuterie, great assortment of meats cheese and nomz. The pizza was rustic and as good as Bianco, Cibo, or Federal which are a few of my favorites in this town. 

Check out this hot new spot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Got a notice on my instagram about Nook opening recently in Phoenix. Had to come try it out for a quick bite after work.

Happy Hour 4-6pm, Hummus plate was filling and had a plethora of veggies to accompany the two large scoops of hummus. 

Margherita Pizza add Chicken and their peppers. Very light but filling."}
{"text":"Super attentive staff, healthy options and downtown location right on the light rail make this a great option.  Give it a try.  The lobby bar in the Hilton Garden Inn in the same building seems super cool as well."}
{"text":"Been here many times with the family. Amazing selection of wine, excellent food, incredible waitstaff, need I say more? I recommend the Vangole pizza. I love this place."}
{"text":"Awesome! I expected this to be your run-of-the-mill eatery, and I was pleasantly shocked. The pizza was traditional Italian and cooked perfectly. The spiced chicken dish was incredible. Crispy exterior with mouth-watering tender meat beneath, spiced to perfection. The charcuterie could probably use another meat or two for variety, but was otherwise bountiful. Great local and traditional beer selection. The seasonal ale I had was excellent. Attentive service and a hip atmosphere for a Friday night. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. Loved the ambiance. The service was that of a five star establishment. The food was sooooooo good.  They have something for anyone and everyone while keeping a simple menu as to not be overwhelmed with options.  I drove about 20 minutes from my home to try this place out and will become a regular from here on out. Do yourself a favor and trust me on this one you won't regret it....  Try this place out!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful experience at the Nook Kitchen.
We were looking through Yelp for a downtown restaurant for dinner before the symphony and picked the Nook because of the glowing reviews.
The Nook was much better than we expected.
The staff was the best, friendly, inviting. I felt like I was having dinner at a good friends house.
The food was fantastic. Everyone in our party of six loved their food and vowed to return.
Thanks again for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"$26 for a pasta dish that had 3 shrimp only tasty but a small dish for the price. I also ordered the short rib appetizer and got double of what i ordered and had to pay for it. Server was a bit rude and took forever to take orders."}
{"text":"This restaurant was our August roomie dinner and was recommended by my roommates sister.  We had never heard of it and had no preconceived notions about it.

It was in a shopping center that you would never think this real cool urban restaurant would lie. Easy and lots of parking  (close to Zipps). When we walked in, the place was pretty busy, the very nice hostess said we could sit at the bar and wait for a table to be ready.  

We sat at the bar and the bartender Anthony got us our drink orders while we waited. He also recommended the arancini ball appetizer so we ordered that. And the presentation and taste was delicious. After waiting for a while, we loved all the service we were getting from Anthony so we decided to stay sitting at the bar and eat dinner there just so we could keep him as a server !

I ordered the prosciutto pizza and my roommate ordered the chicken marsala. Both were absolutely, mouth-watering delicious.  The pizza was so light and the Ingredients were fresh. The chicken marsala had so much flavor! I already know I want to go back and try the salmon.

Definitely would recommend this place to ANYONE and ask for Anthony at the bar! He made our night that much more better!"}
{"text":"We started off with the mozzarella bruschetta with cherry tomatoes ., homemade bread and mozzarella Che's with a drizzle of balsamic. I had the short rib dinner. It was excellent the rib was moist and fork tender. It came with some mashed potatoes and green beans -- a very hearty meal. My husband enjoyed his pork chop. We topped off dinner sharing an apple upside down cake and vanilla ice cream. A very lovely evening."}
{"text":"Just finished an OUTSTANDING meal from start to finish at Nook. Great ambiance, decor, and overall feel to the location. The meal was the best we have had, get a pizza SO.GOOD. We also tried a couple apps which were delicious, but  the desserts (an affogato for me and nookerdoodle for the boy) blew us away... So save room!

Ralph was our server, great menu knowledge and table manners. Truly the best service we have received, even the owner stopped at our table to check in. 

Nook, you have us hooked! :) 
We will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"The food here is very fresh and well balanced.  I have been here twice (proximity to the office) and I am happy they are so close.  I will conitnue to come back here with my wife for dinner to explore teh wine list.  Service was very attentive and I even got to meet the owners, they seem very excited to have such a great spot with such good food.  For those in the area, you will not believe that this used to be Darwins, a dingy sports bar.  If that is what you remember come out to see Nook and be impressed."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service and atmosphere.  We have a large dinner club (14) and the owner, chef and server (Ralph) made our evening flawless. The food here is so delicious we can't wait to come back. We started with the pork butt, arancini balls, hummus and poutine.  WOW.. WOW...WOW.. We eat out often with our club and I think this was the best restaurant we've eaten at within the past 12 months.  We moved on to the highly recommended Filet, Pork Chops, Chicken Marsala and several pizzas. Everything was mouthwatering, fresh and well balanced.  The steak was melt in your mouth, and the marsala was one of the best we've had.  Pork chops were also outstanding moist, flavorful and delicious.  The chef came out and we had to give him the kudos that he clearly has earned.  This isn't just a restaurant, it's truly  an experience.  If you love great food, and really really good people this will become your favorite new restaurant. I know that it's mine... Wait..I forgot the desserts...they were AMAZING.. there was an apple dessert (super tasty) but the star of the show was the pot of chocolate with delicious cream and then espresso poured on top.. Seriously... YES it is that GOOD!!! Happy hour was great, food was superb and the service is more than top notch.... Ralph was helpful, courteous and spot on with recommendations.  

Thank you for surprising us with how good experiences should be.."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming to this spot, never disappointed. Great food (for meat lovers or vegetarians), drinks, and service. If you can't decide on something, try one of their pizzas...yum."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, good local beers on draft and great pizza.  Will definitely go back next time I am in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch this afternoon while on a work trip. This restaurant is located in the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Phoenix. The vibe is cool and the interior seems plush but still modern. They have a nice sized patio which is great if you want to sit outside- which I did. Their lunch menu isn't huge, but I'm honestly a fan of that - too many options becomes overwhelming. I opted for their harvest salad with chicken. I was impressed with this salad! It was a great portion size - not too huge but not tiny either. After eating, I was perfectly full. But the real star of this salad was all the yummy ingredients - mixed greens, quinoa, toasted nuts, dried cranberries, celery, avocado, sweet potato, manchego cheese + the chicken. The dressing was also a delicious and light champagne vinaigrette which I ordered on the side. The presentation of the salad in the bowl was also impressive. The only reason I'm docking a star here was for poor service and the fact that the patio is on a very busy sidewalk. Two different people walking down the street  interrupted my lunch asking me to take their picture. If I come back, I think I might eat inside next time."}
{"text":"What a great surprise!! Not only was the quality of the food we ordered excellent but the service was amazing. Our server was Tori and he made our already amazing dining experience that much better. Tori was genuine and a real pleasure. We never felt anything but served and served well. From the minute we arrived until the moment Tori walked us out after a great evening of fun and food. Our food was fresh, hot and perfectly served. Thanks to the management for also being fully engaged during our lovely evening we spent in this excellent restaurant. Thank you! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad but I thought it was way overpriced for what we got. 2 drinks and 2 pizzas and about $70 with tip. I prefer other selections in the area. Drinks were good, though."}
{"text":"After reading all of the glowing reviews of Nook on Yelp, I decided I had to try it.  First of all, you might be caught offguard by the fact that it is in a strip mall, but don't let that bother you.  Once you're inside, you totally forget.  With a name like Nook, it is exactly what you would expect--a cozy little Nook of a place.  There's a bar, several booths along the wall, and a few tables in the back.  We sat in one of the booths and were very comfy.  My only complaint is that it is pretty hot in there, but that's due to the presence of the brick oven.  Although I hate being hot during a meal, I'm a little more understanding when I know the heat is coming from that oven.  However, I will say, that makes me wary about going there in the summer.  Moving on...

The service was very good.  They don't take reservations for parties fewer than 5, and my party was of 4.  My boyfriend and I got there early, though, to have a drink at the bar, and the hostess was nice enough to seat us without the rest of our party being there when the restaurant started to fill up.  We really appreciated that.

Now on to the food.  First, we all shared the shortrib bruschetta.  It was good but not as good as I was hoping for.  The pieces are very small, and, although the shortrib was flavorful, it just wasn't good enough to want it again.  Then our entrees came.  I had the Gamberetti y Funghi pizza.  It was good, but not what I was expecting.  The type of mushroom on it was one that I'd never had before, and it didn't really resemble a normal mushroom to me.  Also the shrimp on it was not my favorite.  Otherwise, the pizza was great--good brick-oven crust, great cheese.  One friend got the Quattro Stagioni pizza and loved it, but I didn't try that b/c I'm not a fan of olives or artichokes.  My boyfriend had the pasta crepe, and it was so different and amazing!  I may have to get it next time.  My friend had the chicken marsala and, although I'm not usually a huge fan, it was fantastic.  

All in all, I loved this place!  Next time I will just wear short sleeves and order a different pizza."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great atmosphere.  The Apocalypto and Re-constructed Mule are awesome drinks, especially the latter.  All the food was all very tasty:  Short ribs bruschetta, potato leek soup, wood fire grill olives.  But the winner was the braised pork belly special.  Tasty!"}
{"text":"The Nook Kitchen is a small spot in Phoenix. They were very accomadating when we came with a group of 8. 

The menu is slightly fancy, but affordable. I really enjoyed the scallops - maybe the best scallop plate I have ever had. The apple crisp dessert and affogato dessert were amazing as well.

I ubered here so I can't speak to parking. I would come here again."}
{"text":"We went due to reviews on Yelp and were not disappointed. The staff were very attentive and had great suggestions regarding cocktails. The food came out quickly, but not too fast. The pizza was excellent (and this is coming from a NY-er!) My only critique was that they were out of some common liquors, but again, the staff had great suggestions for substitutes."}
{"text":"The beer selection is delicious and the food is amazing.  Fantastic food and dining experience and beautiful ambiance.  I was all excited to write a review thinking that I would be one of this first and I am happy to see that there are 111 positive reviews.  The Arcansani and bruchettas are fabulous as the other yelpers mention, but I have eaten here three times and everything on the menu is delicious.  Amazing dining experience and even reasonably priced!  Five stars!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.. Great food you can tell everything is prepared fresh..
FANTASTIC drinks try the apocolypto 

The owner came by a couple of times to check on us and this is always a sign of a good restaraunt seeing he was involved and really cared. Will be back"}
{"text":"Great experience! We had a group of 6, waited a bit for our cocktails but they were worth the wait. Excellent cocktail menu. Not sure why they didn't have more then one bartender on for a full house. I ordered the grilled romaine which is one of my fave dishes and they nailed it. Everyone was pleased with portions and quality of their meals. Decent GF options. It's in the Hilton but doesn't have the stereotypical hotel restaurant vibe. We came in the street side which isn't their preferred entrance (they want you to enter through the hotel) but a gentlemen came out and let us in (warm welcome). Our server wasn't fabulous but he did his job...definitely adding this one to my rotation."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour! The short rib bruschetta melts in your mouth! 
I haven't had one thing I don't enjoy and Anthony (bartender ) makes sure you are always taken care of!"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely outstanding. Water glasses always filled, server had great suggestions, friendly manager, space was interesting and a perfect noise level on a Friday night being that the restaurant itself is pretty narrow. There are a limited number of tables but at 7pm on a weekend we didn't wait for one. 

We were both super hungry so we each ordered a pizza. Didn't get the chance to order an app because we had to catch a late movie but the salads sounded delicious and by how quickly my neighbor table had theirs I'm guessing it was yummy. 

I had the funghi e porco with added SPICY soppressata which was highly recommended by my server and it was the best pizza I've ever had! Crust just right-- not too thin but bit doughy and a nice crispness to it (they have a brick oven at the front of the joint) didn't skimp on ingredients either 
boyfriend had the florentine pizza and had it with a red based sauce also at the recommendation of our server. Absolutely incredible and not too heavy. Ricotta really made it over the top for me. 
Wine was delicious and fairly priced as well. 

Oh and the ladies room had a delicious smelling liquid soap and a sea salt scrub that is available for purchase. SWEET! Apparently the men's room had neither though. 

We left with full bellies and will definitely be back within the month it was THAT GOOD. 
This place is going to get popular QUICKLY but these guys deserve it!"}
{"text":"We went there last night - sometimes difficult to find an open restaurant on Mondays but they were open and very nice atmosphere.  They have valet parking too which is nice.  We had the fig bruschetta appetizer and it was WONDERFUL - that alone was worth the trip.  I had a salmon salad and it was absolutely awesome - tons of different veggies, nuts, seeds and a lovely piece of salmon on top.  My husband had the short ribs with mashed potatoes and he said it was tender and very flavorful.  The wine list was excellent and the service was even better.  DEFINATELY will go again."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried the Chicken Marsala and Spiced Chicken. Like other reviews the Chicken Marsala was delicious! Tasted like the authentic Italian dish. Also liked that it was on linguini and not mashed potatoes. I tried the peas in some kind of cream on friends dish and that was great too. Didn't actually try the chicken on it. We shared the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert. The \"cake?\" was almost the texture of a scone. I'm used to cake, so it was different. After it soaked up some of the berries it was better. The addition of a basil flavor was over the top delicious!

The reason for 4 stars is our waiter was very serious, almost grumpy. We did manage to get a few smiles out of him towards the end of the meal. I believe the man who was the manager/owner? was very helpful when I described a flavored rum drink that I enjoy. Very nice man.

We came on a Wed. So not as busy. With the few booths and bar that was occupied I imagine it would get hard to communicate with your table mates. We asked to be moved down a couple booths.

Menu a bit pricey, however I will be back to try other dishes. The Poutine sounds yummy!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick dinner and found this gem, not big place but the atmosphere was great, pizza was fantastic and service was excellent.  Ate at the bar, with nice wine selections.  Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"Not so much a review as an observation. I love the food at this restaurant, and have frequented it several times over the last year. Tonight was a real eye opener though. Dishwasher drops a towel on the floor mat and unknowingly steps on it. A server notices the towel which has been there for a couple of minutes, and picked it up, placing it on the counter of the wait station. Another server unwittingly begins to clean the wait station with said towel. Once finished the server places said towel near the silverware tubs. Moments later the server proceeds to polish all of the silverware with said towel. All this took place while the owner was completely oblivious and engrossed in whatever was occurring on his smartphone at the time. Really sad because the food is always good here; the chef is very focused and turns out great quality. Think I'll have to wait until this cycle of silverware is done, before returning"}
{"text":"So mayyyyyybe I'm Bougie cuz I've eaten in places across the country and I'm spoiled by living in SoCal, but this place just didn't do it for me.

First off, we showed up about an hour before they closed. I'm super biased cuz I'm not a huge fan of the Camelback Hipsters, but with glowing reviews, we gave it a shot.

The Brussels sprouts were great...the \"aoili\" not so much. Too hipster, too watery, too sweet, too not aoili at all.

I believe I got the braised short rib (writing this a few weeks later and obviously, the meal wasn't memorable, but the lack-luster service was). Mostly I remember our waiter talking with his friends more than waiting on us. The short rib was SUPER dry. It had been in the oven all day apparently. The mashed potatoes were good. The best part was the demi sauce. I would DRINK it.

My bf got this pork chop that was weird. It clashed. Too many flavors, not enough direction."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant.  The bruschetta was very good, we got the fig. Salmon dish was excellent. The little fried balls, I think called aranicci (?) were terrible. Service was good. Overall a 4 star restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered the grilled artichoke and short rib bruschetta. I didn't think I would want grilled artichoke because I wasn't sure how it could be special..boy was I wrong. So yummy. For entrees we had wood fired pizzas and both were amazing. Nice atmosphere but I'm not a fan of sitting/sharing a bench with a stranger. We will def go back and I'll be getting their scallops which they are known for!"}
{"text":"Caprese salad was nice .. service was delightful ... wine on tap was HOT - so defeats wine on tap  GROSS"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Caprese salad and the Bolognese. Also had a glass of Notes Cabernet. Overall very good meal. However, I would not classify this as a $$ restaurant, both food and beverages are definitely in the $$$ range. Again, very cozy and very good service."}
{"text":"Creative Wine and beverage program!  Good food good pricing!  Great addition to downtown phoenix."}
{"text":"The drinks were great, the food was okay. We had the fire olives, bruschetta, shirt rib and scallops. We were visiting town and chose to sit outside, not realizing how busy the street was. It took away from our dining experience. The service was great. We chose this since we were seeing a show downtown. Probably would not go back"}
{"text":"This place is inside the Hilton hotel in downtown phx. It's small but very cute and modern decor.. The food was a lil pricey but overall everything tasted delicious.. No one in our group was complaining about their meal. And our waitress came around often which was great."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't sure how another Italian establishment would fare in this location, but this is such a welcome addition to the neighborhood!  I came for happy hour on a Saturday which is served 7 days a week (love that).  The atmosphere is welcome and casual.  I had the best Pinot Noir on tap for a mere $5, and my friend had a Tito's drink, also $5.  We shared the poutine - so rich and decadent, and a chopped salad which was fresh and healthy.  We were lusting after the pizza that the next table over had ordered, and will definitely be returning for that soon.  Also, our service was excellent and attentive, he even took time to point out other things that were coming out of the kitchen.  I could see making this part of the regular rotation for sure, and will definitely be bringing some friends in here for a meal soon."}
{"text":"Went here on a double date with some of our best friends.  We had the hummus and split a couple pizzas.  The  Pollo Pazzo pizza was my favorite, so so good.  Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Super delicious neighborhood nosh!  I can walk here and it's so so good. Great music & atmosphere.  Laid back, friendly staff.   I always get the Albacore Salad even though it's not on the menu anymore, and it's so so good. My boyfriend swears by their Margarita Pizza, saying it's the BEST pizza in the valley. I definitely recommend Nook to anyone looking for a new restaurant to try. Yum yum, go here!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour on a Friday and got seated almost immediately! The wine selection isn't that fantastic on the happy hour menu but I still managed to get a class of white wine. We then shared the most amazing spicy pepperoni pizza and chopped chicken salad. The salad was decent but the pizza was absolutely mouth watering! I would highly recommend this place but be sure to make reservations. When 6:30 rolled around the place had a pretty large wait. 

Service was excellent as well. There was 8 of us and he managed to give each one of us exactly what we needed! We will be back!"}
{"text":"A group of us tried this place out because of the good reviews, but 3 out of 4 of us were extremely disappointed by the service and food. We told our server we had a show and he still moved slow as molasas. The only good thing we had were the fire roasted olives. We expected more out of this place based on reviews and especially the price. Brucshetta was medeocre and the pasta was not good at all."}
{"text":"Tips:

Happy hour is 4-6pm
Happy hour portions of food is HUGE! Plan accordingly. Bruschetta dishes come with 4 pieces.

Poutine: Huge plate of fries with gravy, cheese curds. (options to add fried egg and short rib for extra $$)
Pork Butt Bruschetta: Highly recommend, tastes very good.
Short Rib Bruschetta: Short rib is very tender and tastes very good with the cheese topping!

Fed 2 people just fine with leftovers!

The decor is amazing at Nook Kitchen, it's largely a bar set-up, but the decor is very nice. Very versatile space for a nice date to a casual bar hang-out. Service was great and very attentive."}
{"text":"Was very excited about this place and was disappointed. Pizza, salads, artichoke, bruchetta and drinks were a C at best."}
{"text":"Finely crafted fresh home made cuisine with wonderful after tastes that had us doing a guessing game as to the wonderful seasonings.

Our new downtown favorite !"}
{"text":"Excellent experience! Food was amazing and the ambiance was on point! I took a client here for dinner and the wait staff aimed to please. The waiter went and got a sugar free Red Bull for a person in our party which was super sweet!  Will definitely come here again with family and clients."}
{"text":"We went to Nook because of a recommendation from a local and we were not disappointed. It is a small, quaint restaurant but the decor is modern and tasteful. There was a 45 minute wait but we were invited to sit at the bar (where you can order food) until our table was ready. We were promptly greeted by the bartender who got us drinks and menus. It was fun to sit and watch them make pizzas. Although small, it was not overly noisy. It did not take 45 minutes for our table to be ready so we were escorted there. Our waiter was great, friendly and personable. He recommended a pizza that we went with and we also ordered the filet. Food was prompt and hot. The pizzas are amazing with great flavor and the filet was cooked perfectly and was also melt in you mouth good. I would highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"We greatly enjoyed dinner here. The food was very fresh. My husband loved his shrimp and pasta dish. I think the pasta is homemade.  In any case, it was so creamy and delicious, when I had a taste.  

I had an arugula salad with a lemony dressing and a bruschetta with tomatoes and basil on toasted bread.

Then, one of the best desserts we have had... ever...which is saying a lot!  Apple cinnamon cake with ice cream. 

Ralph was our server and he was so sweet and accommodating.  We will definitely return when in the area."}
{"text":"Such a darling place! It has a warm and inviting feel to it from the layout to the decor. We went for our manager's going away dinner. We work at a restaurant so we all know about what good service should look like. Our server was nice, but short on conversation and lacked attentiveness. We had empty glasses of water and it took him a while to fill it. Other than that he did do a decent job. The food was amazing! I had the Chicken Artichoke Bruschetta. They don't skimp on the chicken or artichoke and the crostini was crunchy and baked to perfection. My coworkers got a chicken pizza which had several types of vegetables. It was tasty and wasn't too greasy. Another group of coworkers got the diavolo pizza which they devoured and enjoyed. The food prices are reasonable for the amount you get. The drink prices are great! They also had live music which was amazing! The guys voice was beautiful. Overall, it was a fun time, and I will be coming back, for the happy hour!"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate a friends bday this past weekend & didn't really know where we were going, but of course we checked it out on yelp. Reviews and pics were great, so we were hopeful.  But when we arrived, we were so impressed by the exquisite decor and ambiance. 

Then we all ordered different dishes and we all thoroughly enjoyed it! We had bruschettas, various pizzas, salad, salmon dish and an ooey goey cake (UUHHMAZING)! 

Our friends are pretty picky and one of them is a professional caterer.  Even they were impressed with the food. 

I'll be celebrating my 35th bday and this is where I want to enjoy a bday dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"I hesitate to share how good this place is, as I want it to myself, but everyone who works there is so nice, and I want them to do a fantastic business.  We have eaten there about 10 or 12 times.  I have great respect for Chris Bianco, for what he has done, and his pizza is sublime, but Nook's pizza is just as good, and in some cases might even be better.  The owners are fanatic about having the best and freshest ingredients.  I also like the vibe, which has the casual feel of your favorite neighborhood bar, but with exquisite food that you have never tasted at any bar.  The Chicken Marsala should win an award, as should many of their pizzas, which come from perhaps the larger pizza oven in AZ.  Ralph and Jorge are top notch waiters, too."}
{"text":"Absolutely INCREDIBLE food and service. The atmosphere is incredible also. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Diamond in the ruff. Absolutely amazing wines, steaks and pizza. But more than anything the people that greeted us, served us and shared the entire menu with us was amazing. Truly the best find on our trip!"}
{"text":"Flawless. From welcoming to service to walking out. As we got back to the truck I buckled in and looked over, telling Matt, \"I think my favorite part of the whole night was when we were leaving\". This confused him.
We called ahead (we have a 2 year old in tote) they were welcoming of us bringing our toddler and as we walked in we were warmly greeted with a lighthearted joke about being a party of 2 and a half. We were ushered quickly to a lovely table next to the floor to ceiling windows (if you have a toddler, you understand this feature is more than aesthetically pleasing).
The waitress (forgive me for not getting any names that evening) was patient and accommodating, quickly bringing out Laige's milk and then our drinks --let me tell you how dead that art form is on it's own! Laige, of course grew impatient with his high chair and the hostess brought over a coloring page and some crayons (Crayola I might add, not just the throw away wax). That kept him occupied long enough for our waitress to run us through the specials for the night (December 2, 2018). 
Matt went with the lobster ravioli with a creamy tomato sauce and I went with the steak special that came topped with a poached pear, goat cheese and a beautiful tulle served over a seasonal hash. First of all my pictures do these plates NO justice.
The ravioli was perfectly cooked, not falling off the fork on the way to your mouth and the lobster inside was rich and buttery married with the creamy sauce the first bite left you hungry for the next. Like that moment you finally feel comfort, last night comfort was wrapped in pasta and I can't say that doesn't make sense.
The steak was ordered rare and cut like butter. I love the richness of a prime beef cut and married with the mild sweetness of the poached pear and the bit of tart from the creamy goat cheese. Chefs strive for an umami balance with every bite you take (food is more than just food to these people) and this dish completely achieved that sensation. Not to mention the bed of seasonal hash in which you can tell every component was dealt with individually which is how the proper mouth feel was achieved. A hash shouldn't be mush, but they knew that and took care to not make that mistake.
We cleared our plates. Not a bite left. 

But what meant the most to me was how we were thanked upon receiving the check, the clearing of the plates, as we packed up our son and again as we walked out the door. \"Thank you for coming in\" \"We are so glad you enjoyed your meal\" \"See you soon and thank you again for coming in\". It isn't very often a sense of community is built after a meal, but it is something I look for in any experience  we include our son in. And it was very special to have the opportunity to share a perfectly rounded experience with our little. I cannot thank the front house or kitchen staff enough! Above and beyond in every aspect! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. One of my favorite spots in Phoenix. The funghi or as I call it the truffle pie is super tasty. Awesome environment and ambiance, great wines, and the service is on point. Ask for Nick or Ralph."}
{"text":"The Nook is an immediate phoenix staple!  I came here and met up with the fam, I didn't really have any expectations whatsoever.  I feel like that is the best type of experience to have, it really gives any establishment the opportunity to wow their customers.  That's exactly what The Nook did for me.  I love how it is connected to a hotel with easy access from inside, also the decor was very modern and hipster-ish.  This \"new age\" restaurant atmosphere that numbers of restaurant owners have adopted is so amazing.  The Nook sets the ambiance to a very relaxed, comfortable feeling which makes it great to come in groups. 

The mixologist Dustin is very skillful, and constructed the drink menu himself from my understanding.  He definitely sets the bar for any other bartender out there.  By experimenting with different aromas all the way to different types of seasonings.  He truly makes it a day to remember.  Check out my pics of the drinks he made, I attached the recipes.

I love how the city is coming to fruition, with so many new and upcoming restaurants like The Nook, it makes me proud to be a Phoenician."}
{"text":"Cozy neighborhood eatery with a wood burning pizza oven. The short rib bruschetta was entirely forgettable, but we also ordered the Porco e Fungi pizza. After the disappointing appetizer, I had mentally mocked the descriptors on the menu...\"house pulled mozzarella\" ...seriously ..it's cheese. How good could it be? Boy was I wrong!

The pizza was *perfectly* cooked. A Lightly crisped crust with just the right amount of sauce. Impeccably juicy sausage, nestled in pillows of supple mozzarella.  (Possibly buratta, or any of mozzarella's more tender varieties) Warm brown mushrooms bursting with flavor all topped with freshly shredded basil 

Nook sells a few decorative/bed and bath totchkes at the front of the store. The ladies room had sample of one of their salted herbal scrubs. (Simply divine!) I really wanted to buy one, but I couldn't find it on the shelf.

We stooped in for lunch just because we were curious. We'll definitely be back for happy hour and dinner"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Service was whatevs. I had their scallop dish and it was delicious!
I just don't get why all our dishes came out at totally different times. Hate that. Yes, we were a big group but we did make reservations and they should have been prepared."}
{"text":"We stopped in after an early D'backs game and luckily they had a table for our group of four.  We were greeted promptly by our waiter.  He was tied up with a large table so the owner, Frank came over and took our drink orders.  I wasn't sure which sparkling wine to select and he brought me a sample of one.  It was a winner and our drinks were served quickly.  Frank even took our appetizer order.  When our waiter returned he knew what we had ordered and made some suggestions for dinner.  Even though the restaurant was packed everything was brought to us in a timely manner and was delicious. The fig bruschetti and humus appetizers were great and the pizzas are quite large.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"We ordered to go for a pizza and it was not what we wanted at all! No clams at all the bacon was raw pretty much and the top of the pizza was burned but the bottoms was doughy! Not impressed for 20 dollars for a medium pizza!"}
{"text":"Great little place with yummy food. Very attentive staff and the owner came by the table say hello which I always appreciate. The prices seem a bit high (just a bit) but I'm sure that's relative to Arcadia. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here - actually extremely disappointing. 

Was here last Friday with my wife and we decided to eat at the bar. Ordered a few beers, the Hummus appetizer plate and that basic Italian staple ... a simple Margherita Pizza. 

The interior vibe honestly feels more like a slightly hipster bar and not so much a restaurant per se. There is a decent size wood burning pizza oven off to one side of the bar. From my vantage point there wasn't much \"fire\" or wood in the oven and boy was I right. No exaggeration but our little Margherita pizza took almost 30 min to be served! Are you kidding me? I ordered the pizza well done as I usually do but a typical wood oven at say Cibo, Bianco or Grimaldi's (all far superior to Nook btw) should cook a pizza at maybe 750+ degrees in less than 5 min. I know our pizza was in that oven for an eternity as I watched the guy moving it around for 30 min while we sat twiddling our thumbs hungrily waiting for our pie. 

In the end the wait wasn't worth it. Pizza was not well done, too much cheese, tasteless dough (especially compared with the wonderful Federal Pizza) and nothing special. 

The hummus plate was also a dud - made far too thick and pasty with not much flavor. 

This is a flash in the pizza pan Yelpers. If this operation exists in a year I will be shocked. Apparently the owners came from Cowboy Ciao as past workers there. Sad that they can't figure out how to cook a pizza. 

I'd come back for a beer - definitely not the food."}
{"text":"How the hell does a small, out of date strip mall like this have 2 amazing restaurants?!? With Crudo right behind this place you may overlook this little Nook. Well, opening the doors to this place you go from a ugh I don't want to be seen in front of this building (JK) to a whole different feeling. Cool little dark feel and vibe to this place. Raised, half circled booths line the length of the long restaurant and gives it a more intimate feel. Of course, I came for takeout, idiot!! Trust me I will be back to enjoy the restaurant next time. Anyways, for starters we got the fig bruschetta with asparagus and prosciutto (you put this on anything and I'm all in!!). Nailed it!! The Diavolo pizza was next! Now next to prosciutto on my list of meats I must devour is soppressata. Well chorizo, then soppressata. Thin sliced soppressata accompanied by fresh mozzarella and basil. Hellz yeah good. The soppressata has some good heat to it so be warned if you don't like spice! Nook is yet one of many unreal good pizza joints in town. I swear it must be these chefs reproducing at alarming rates. How can you have so many great pizza places? Nook Nailed it!!! I will update my review after I eat here. Might be a 5 star"}
{"text":"Went in for an impromptu Dinner Date and had a great time.  Ambiance was great, they have a cool chill duo playing jams on Tuesday.  Our server was Ally and she was Great!  We started with Arugula salad and A Caprese Bruschetta both of which were tasty.  We decided on the Vongole Pizza and Short Ribs.  Short Ribs were Delicious and came with Mashed Potato and Haricot Vert.  Pizza was excellent, the fresh Mozzerla was amazing.  My only suggestion would be to not chop the little neck clams so you can have a more prominent bite and have the ability taste them.  There is so much richness that I feel they got lost in the mix.  Overall it was an awesome experience and we will return to sample some other offerings!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. I was lucky enough to just this place after a little yelp browsing. Great atmosphere, great service, and great food.

The Chicken Marsala, with the home made linguini was AMAZING. I could have easily ordered another round of it- it was truly that good. Also, the short rib bruschetta was great as well.

Definitely don't miss out on this place if your in Phoenix."}
{"text":"What a great spot! We grabbed dinner here after cocktails at Undertow across the street. Parking was easy and we were seated for our reservation in a great booth right away.

We had a margarita pizza and entrees. It was fantastic. The filet was perfect and the potatoes had a great truffle oil flavor. 

I will definitely keep this hot spot on my short list!"}
{"text":"Short on value. Wine is way over priced. $14 for a marginal Chardonnay, and a short pour! Salmon entree was good but over priced. Chicken salad for $12 - should have known better. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Bad service, Bland Pizza, and really really overpriced. The whole night, we only saw our waitress maybe 3 times (not even busy, like four tables out of the whole place had people). With the pizza, there wasn't any pazzaz to it... Very bland. and lastly; with two people and no appetizers or alcohol, the bill ended up being about $75. For those prices, i'd expect a much better experience. With service and food."}
{"text":"Long time listener, first time reviewer. My husband and I visited Nook for dinner on a Monday night after hearing good things about their chicken marsala. Now I've had my fair share of chicken marsala dishes from a wide variety of establishments, and Nook's version easily tied for first place. The rich sauce was a perfect compliment to perfectly cooked chicken and tender linguini. I'll be back. Oh, and my husband cleaned his plate as well. He had the Diavolo pizza.  The atmosphere was comfortable yet just upscale enough for date night. I can't fail to mention the service, which was top notch. Our server Nick took excellent care of us, and the owner made sure to stop and ask how everything was. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The fungi pizza was really really good overall the ambiance is ok. Staff was a little lack luster they were on their phones and chatting with one another rather than helping customers. BUT the food was good so they still earned 4 stars!"}
{"text":"A superbly enjoyable meal here, from top to bottom. We had the artichoke and arancini and both were extremely good and perfectly prepared. I then had the filet and the wife had the bolognese. The filet was just surprising in its presentation and flavor. I'm not typically a fan of sauce on steaks but this was exceptional all around and perfectly cooked. The wife loved her bolognese as well.

Finally, the nookerdoodle dessert was insane and brilliant, and the service was excellent. Our waiter Ralph was just on point.

We'll definitely be back. A real fun menu, great staff, and delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink and some pizza.  Had the Calabrese and it was awesome, perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and savory. Cocktails were great too. Try the Rhubarb and Rye. Our Bartender Matt was incredible and Frank the owner stopped by to chat with us also. Great experience. They do a really good job here, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing Happy Hour menu, Tito's on tap, bruschetta are delicious!

I recommend any pizza, the bolognese and the salmon. All very good and high quality.

The staff is incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"My first time here at this downtown Phx location. I always enjoyed the Arcadia location, especially during happy hour. Conveniently located inside the Hilton Garden Inn. Impressive and gorgeous place.

We wanted something lite so shared the chicken artichoke brushettas. It came with 4 pieces. They were piled with chunky pieces of grilled chicken, spinach, roasted garlic ricotta, and artichokes. It was incredibly satisfying for a little plate. 

Two servers took care of us. Drinks were always replenished. 

The neighborhood can still be a little scary depending on the time and day. I'll probably return to the Arcadia location more often since it's no parking fee. Another great option to downtown PHX area though."}
{"text":"Wow totally stunned by the amazing service and AMAZING PIZZA and their menu. I'm Italian and I grew up in Italy and know my pizza very well. This place shows that it has put dedication and care and mixed with passion it made definitely the highlight for the best dining place in downtown. 
To the the whole staff and the owner Nick, GREAT JOB!!!!!!   Thank you for the amazing experience!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We really like this place, which is really close to us. The bruschetta is out of this world but a little on the expensive side for all the food. Nice small ambience and friendly staff
Update review; Nook has been consistently good. Nice low key ambience and out of this world pizza's. Please give the pizza man a raise! (Good looking dude with KC hat). Pizzas are sooooo yummy!! We are one block away. Our go to place..."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place. The fries with beef gravy and egg is delicious. The pizza with sausage, cheese and minus mushrooms on gluten free crust was very yummy. Strongly recommend this place. I may have found a new favorite."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We're pretty picky about our pizza and this place is on the top of our favorite list. We're from San Jose, California visiting and this restaurant is one of the highlights of our vacation. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The location we visited downtown is attached to the coolest Hilton Garden Inn I've ever seen.  If this is the future of hotel restaurants, I'm so in.  We started with the arancini, which are amazing fried risotto balls.   Yummmmm.  These were good!  We were able to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather too.

I was craving comfort food and sticking to an Italian theme, as I tend to do; fresh pasta is hard for me to turn down.  Hello, bolognese!  I thought their pasta was tasty.  I ate every noodle.  If I go back, I'll have to give their pizza a try.

No complaints here really good food and service from our end."}
{"text":"Seemed like a hole in the wall place so I wasn't expecting much for the food but I was surprised. Had the fungi pizza which was pretty good. A little pricey but I was overall impressed with the food."}
{"text":"The ambiance, service and food reminds me of a restaurant you would find in New York, London or Paris. There's a pride of ownership that one rarely finds. The food is delicious and the menu is well curated by dishes that you can't find just any where. Big ups to Nook Kitchen. May you enjoy many years of success."}
{"text":"In town for work and saw this gem as I strolled by. Really great vibe inside- enjoyed a drink and entree at the bar while watching the World Series on the big flat screen. The mezcal cocktail was delicious as was the grilled salmon entree. Salmon slightly over cooked, but still delicious. The mashed cauliflower it came with rocked my world. Was hungover next day from mezcal cocktail (or maybe the red wine I had afterwards) but probably worth it. Would give overall 4.5 stars but can't give half stars on Yelp."}
{"text":"The service here is exceptional! The bartender is a true local legend and makes an amazing Mule!! The restaurant has a nice atmosphere but it is a little pricey!"}
{"text":"All the red signs here in this plaza look a like, so Nook didn't stand out to me. :/ 

I absolutely love this place. My waiter was nice but Mr. Tagan was awesome. Anddddd he's the manager.  He was so friendly, funny ( trying to make jokes at me) and very catering :)

I had the Quattro Stagioni, minus the olives and parmesan. Which two slices has spinach and tomatoes, two slices with sautéed mushrooms, two slices with artichoke and two slices with ricotta cheese and mushrooms. I don't know how I felt about the artichoke, it was too tangy for me. The rest was satisfying!

Creamy gorgonzola sauce, and tapitio is a great mix for dipping sauce. Phenomenal!!!!!!

I overall like this place, I shall come back for happy hour! :)"}
{"text":"Had a lovely dining experience tonight.  First, a great recommended wine.  Then the short rib bruschetta. ..wow.  Will get full size plate next time.  But really  delicious salmon with cauliflower mash too.  Great server and cozy seat."}
{"text":"Great chic spot. Limited but diverse menu of items to choose from. I was headed to a comedy show so I couldn't be as adventurous as I'd like. The pizza is darn tasty. I love the thin crust. I'll be back to the more."}
{"text":"Hophead Vodka & Tonic was perfect. HH menu was solid. We had the Skirt Steak (which was actually a 6 ounce ribeye) and the Chicken Marsala. I would recommend either of those to anybody, great customer service great food."}
{"text":"Love this place! I came here about a month ago to do a wine tasting for a bachelorette party. Not sure if they do this regularly but it was a great accommodation. The owner (also a sommelier) put together some small plates of charcuterie, fruits, and nuts and paired them with all different kinds of wine. 

The service was great and the he did a phenomenal job explaining the most commonly used wino terms. He also taught us how to pick out some great wines and made awesome wine recommendations for the budget friendly wine drinker:)"}
{"text":"Went to Nook Arcadia for my birthday. Had the artichoke starter, and caprese bruschetta.... delish. But the highlight for me was the Vongole pizza. Clams and bacon, white pizza. Served with fresh lemon. It was fantastic. Service was also very good."}
{"text":"If there is a \"good\" pizza place in Phoenix, you know damn well that I will eventually try it out.  The Nook had been on my bookmarked list for awhile now, I just never am down in this area though.  I watched a movie downtown mid afternoon, and wanted to eat somewhere semi nearby to avoid some traffic.  Bookmark removed...The Nook,  it was!  I drove down, parked, walked inside, and was directed to a seat at the bar.  As soon as I sat down, the bartender poured me a glass of ice water.  I LOVE when that happens.  She didn't ask, she just offered it up!  Great service from the get go!  I browsed over the menu and decided to go with the Giardino Pizza.  Sitting at the bar was nice!  They have 2 big screens that were showing basketball, plus, you get a front row seat of watching the guys make pizza.  They have their pizza station and oven at one end of the bar.  It helped pass the time.  About 10 minutes later, my pizza was presented in front of me.  Here is how it was.............

The Giardino-  This pizza has house pulled mozzarella, parmesan, spinach, caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, basil and extra virgin olive oil.  I am usually anti vegetable (I rarely eat them alone), but for whatever reason, I have come across some great veggie pizzas here in Phoenix, and this one sounded very good and I decided to check it out.  

The pizza was placed in front of me and I noticed that it was larger than most \"individual\" pizzas served at most places.  It was cut into 8 nice sized slices.  I picked up a piece and took a bite and was pretty darn impressed.  The crust held up and didn't flop over, so I folded my piece and ate it pretty quick.  All those veggies combined for some great flavor.  The only particular veggie that could have been better was maybe the onions.  I prefer a red/raw type onion on my pizza.  These caramelized ones were a bit too soft and threw a different flavor profile in the mix.  It would have been a better pizza with red onions.  All the other veggies were great though!  It had tons of mushrooms, lots of soft roasted tomatoes, decent amount of spinach, just enough garlic and mozzarella and a nice sprinkling of pamesan.  These were all laid upon a thin crust dough with an outer crust that had just enough thickness and chew to it.  It was a very good pizza!

Service was very friendly and attentive, but not overbearing.  The pizza was $14.00 which was fair.  I will definitely be back because I want to try out their Calabrese Pizza.  The atmosphere was cozy and chill.  There were other solo diners at the bar, so I didn't feel out of place eating by myself.  It was a cool spot and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"So...I went to the OG location down on Indian School a few months back, and had a pretty good pizza.  I saw that they had opened up a new spot here downtown, and I decided to swing by before my Cardinals vs Diamondbacks game.  

I arrived a little after 4:30 and was one of two people in the place (other guy was sitting at the bar).  There were a ton of workers hanging out prepping the restaurant and getting everything ready for the dinner rush (if there was one?).  I knew what I was going to order before I even came in, so when my waitress came over, I ordered a glass of water and a Calabrese Pizza.  A little while later, my pizza was ready.  Here is how it was....................

Calabrese Pizza-  This was a white pizza and it came with house-pulled mozzarella, parmesan, taleggio, caramelized onions, sweet sausage, calabrian chiles, extra virgin olive oil and some basil.  It was delicious!  The sweet sausage was fantastic!  I ate a few pieces by itself, and it was spot on...just a great sweet Italian sausage!  The caramelized onions added some more sweetness on top of the sausage.  The mozzarella was nice and rich, and the calabrian chiles added a little \"pop\" to each bite.  All these delicious flavors were thrown upon a nice thin, charred crust.  It was thin, but not so thin that your slice would droop.  You could pick up each slice and enjoy it without knife and fork.  I dusted that pizza off in no time and was ready for the bill.  About that.............

The Calabrese pizza is normally $16.00.  When my waitress brought me my bill, it rang up at only $13.00.  I am assuming that pizzas are $3.00 off during Happy Hour?  I didn't ask, I kept my mouth shut and left my waitress a $20.00.  

Service was excellent!  My waitress was very friendly and personable, and never let my water get below half full.  The space where they created this restaurant is pretty cool, too!  I'm sure I will be back at some point.  The pizza is pretty damn good and its right down near Chase Field and Talking Stick so its convenient to grab a bite to eat here before heading to a game."}
{"text":"Loved the drinks and the quinoa salad here. The reconstructed mule was my favorite! Sit outside on a nice night and enjoy their lovely drinks and healthy food options."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough amazing things about Nook. My husband and I have been here at least four times now and each time is exceptional. We live within walking distance (which is both great and dangerous) and Nook is part of the reason we want to stay in this area!

Pizza is always awesome. Appetizers are SO GOOD (we went a week or so ago with my family and had the arancini and the artichoke special - we basically licked the plates clean!). Drinks are amazing - especially the specialty Mules. My favorite was the white pear, but each one has been awesome.

We got my brother in law hooked on the Pasta Crepe - and the four pepper cream sauce it comes with is one of the best things I've ever tasted. 

Desserts are always amazing and unique and service is always great, too. And they take reservations, which we love. All in all, Nook is one of our favorite places in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here with friends for a quick bite before our reservation at UnderTow. I ended up splitting a prosciutto pizza with a friend and everyone who tried it thought the crust was to \"crackery\" and bland, but I really liked it. I think everyone else enjoyed their meal for the most part. Garren thought his cocktail tasted like yoga pants, but he did still drink it so it was either not that bad or he's into yoga pants. Not sure on that one."}
{"text":"I am so very disappointed in your restaurant:( we would have spent a hefty tab if we were treated with respect and actually paid attention to.  Here is my review. Thankfully the 2nd restaurant turned what could have been a bad vacation night into something great. As avid fine diners, my husband and I could not believe the horrible experience we had at Nook kitchen: On Saturday, Luis and I had reservations at a place in Phoenix called Nook Kitchen.  We did our research for weeks and had our heart set on it. It was located inside an upscale hotel, and reminded us of Hotel Fullerton's restaurant which we are regulars at. I was very specific about the reservation and let them know we were celebrating my birthday and our wedding anniversary.  We get to the restaurant and it takes forever for us to flag the hostess down, yet she seats other people.  We finally get her attention and tell her of our reservation. She sits us at the worst seat in the whole restaurant. Right near her hostess podium! Right where people stand and wait.  This is a spacious restaurant. You would think celebrating two occasions would equal best seat available. Anyways, after abour 10 min a server takes our order of a bottle of wine.  30 min then pass and we never received our wine! I was so sad and disappointed.  So we left. We are not going to drop a $100 tab on an establishment who doesn't care about our business. So we hop on a community bike and ask them to take us to \"Valley Bar\" because it was near our concert we had tickets to. and everything else was packed.  The driver drops us off in an alley and we see what looks like a dive bar. We were so hungry so pressed for time so we said let's just try it. Omg! It was amazing. Underground, haunting, beautiful speak easy with a modern yet vintage feel. They treated us with the best service!! We ate like kings. Gorgeous charcuterie platters and we splurged and had bacon cheese fries. The cheese was so delicious and hand crafted. We split an amazing bottle of pinot noir and left so satisfied. We planned this trip around Luis work schedule and we were so happy to have a night to ourselves in Phoenix. Thank You, Valley Bar for the best experience ever! Can't wait to go back next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place near Arcadia & Biltmore areas. Quieter out of the way location off of Indian School Rd. Think of it as \"neighborhood bar meets upscale bistro\". Outstanding menu but beware, it changes and online menu not in synch with what's in the restaurant (which had changed from a prior printed menu). Food was of high quality and well-prepared. Service was attentive if not a little doting. Live entertainment during our week night visit. Would definitely try again and wish I lived closer. Try the humus bruschetta, was amazing."}
{"text":"So, I graduated with a double major and 2 months later, I was still unemployed as fate would have it. Thus, instead of wallowing in ice cream and Netflix, I decided to gorge my sorrows down at all the pizzerias in Arcadia after every failed interview like a true champ during this slow period of agony.

I still have to write reviews for the other places, but Nook is definitely freshest in my mind. This review speaks mostly to the prosciutto and meat lovers. If you happen to be a gluten-free, veggie lover, you and your cult can stop reading as of right now. Most other pizza places only give you the smaller option of like a 7\" pizza, but here at Nook, their standard is a lot bigger and honestly you could split between two and not break the bank. Not a single space on the pizza is left empty, even if you only ordered just one simple topping because their fresh-pulled mozzarella is like an entirely new topping, with certain areas with bigger chunks of cheese than other areas. Only thing that kind of irked me was that I asked to add spinach and instead of sprinkling it throughout the crust and baking it, they just put a bunch of raw spinach in the middle which isn't exactly what I was expecting. 

It seriously was like my eyes were deceiving me. There was so much prosciutto on my pizza that I can only compare it as if you were unfolding an onion. Layer after layer, it was never ending, like it was saying \"Don't worry Loretta, we'll always be here for you.\" So reassuring and gratifying, just like the guy's voice from those Allstate commercials. 

We also had the Pork Butt appetizer and those were right on par as well, not too much sauce to just overwhelm the taste buds and just a little coleslaw for some coolness and tang. 

Great place for a date and service is very friendly and flexible with options. Great place that takes the extra time to concentrate on careful portions."}
{"text":"First time eating dinner here and will highly recommend to all! All 5 of us were happy with our dinner and drink selections.  Loved the scallops and prime ribs! Next time will try to get a spot at the bar- it looked like fun energy there! Warm, friendly service, thank you for making my dads birthday dinner great!"}
{"text":"Along with their wonderful food (wood fired olives are my favorite) Nook Kitchen is now serving Bourbon flights just in time for fall..."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times over the past few years and they never disappoint. You are always met by a super friendly hostess, Matt behind the bar is always a homerun and the food is some of the best in town. Arguably the best \"wine by the glass\" menu in the valley. Great place for a date or the family."}
{"text":"Nook reminds me of Hell's Kitchen. It was surprising to find such a trendy (but not pretentious) place in this little stretch. 

Gritty, yet artfully decorated, narrow, long and lit for an intimate conversation. The food and wine sampled was impeccable and I'm eager to visit again. With a bigger appetite tho!

This place had the perfect date/romance ambience feeling in full effect. Sound is perfectly carried upward. Even with limited amounts of seating, conversation feels private and not shared with a neighboring table.

Note: You may very well be sampling something from the drink menu while waiting for a table. We were seated immediately (Wed ~7:30pm). However, I think we just happened to have great timing. The restaurant was buzzing with energy and filled almost to capacity after we were seated. 

The bar stretches nearly the length of the restaurant. There are two televisions.

My partner in crime is a foodie and knows a substantial amount about wine. We were both equally pleased with our red wine selections. The cocktail menu looked interesting as well. (They have a drink called \"The Closing Argument\" which made me laugh. It's too bad I'm no longer dating a lawyer to test that one out;)

After lazily enjoying our wine we finally looked at the food menu. Our server was present, checking on us but never urging us out the door to make a decision. With great difficulty we picked the \"Calabrese\" from the Pizza Bianco menu.

Hoh. Geez.
Mozzarella, Taleggio, Caramelized Onions, Sweet Sausage, Calabrian Chilis, EVOO & Basil.

There was no need to have accepted the offer for crushed red peppers on the side. The pizza was mouth watering and is just so difficult to describe. The sausage and the chili had the right amount of kick. When partnered with the cheese (Hoh. My) and caramelized onions. Well, amazing things happened in my mouth.

This place is a definite must. 

Must try. 
Must go.
Must go again.

Yeah, that good.

UPDATE:
Dude, you have to try the Chicken Marsala. Seriously. Someone at my table did and was fawning over it. I thought he had to be crazier than normal. 

\"Oh. NO. Seriously. It's so soft. I was able to cut into it using the back of my butter knife.\"

Whatever. Then I fork sampled. LIKE FIVE TIMES.
This was a situation where licking a plate would have been appropriate. You know. because THAT can happen. 

(I was sadly only able to fork sample 5x's as I was daft and waited too long. Pity the fool that makes this mistake!)

I'm going back again and ordering this plate solo. Don't come with me, I'm not sharing. We may be friends ... but NOT at the table ;)

The other item that looked ridonkulously yummy was the meat and cheese platter. We were told it was made to accompany wine. Well, have a look at my photo. It's big! For a gal, that's a generous serving.

GOOD STUFF HERE!

Also, 
I forgot. They have wifi here. Ask for the password! You'll laugh when they give it to you :)"}
{"text":"Very delicious drinks, nice atmosphere, and extremely rude bar tender!  Recommended if you are lucky and find a \"nicer\" bar tender. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Sadly, as I am a huge Arcadia Nook fan, I cannot give this location the 5 star rating I was totally expecting to give.  I am in love with the Wood Fired Olives appetizer here, we ordered that and it was totally on par with the Arcadia location.  My family ordered two pizza's the Giardino and the Margherita and said it was also on par with Arcadia and they looked great.    

My order was the Cowboy Rib Eye.  I typically bounce back and forth between the Chicken Marsala and the Filet, and I tell everyone the Filet at Nook Arcadia is the best $27 filet you will ever eat.   They don't offer the Filet here so I went with their new Ribeye which is $34 and served over smashed Yukon Gold potatoes with four asparagus spears on the side.  

Presentation and plating was beautiful... My mouth was watering... The ribeye was bone-in BUT it was full of fat and gristle, it was edible but I spent most of the time trying to cut around the gristle or pulling it out of my mouth. I don't mind fat in my steak I just prefer more to steak to fat, and not the tough gristle this steak had throughout.  The potatoes which were advertised as garlic parmesan were also bland and seem to be lack both garlic and parmesan. The asparagus was good.  This is not anything like the preparation or quality of the Filet at Arcadia and it was a 2 star dish for me for sure on the steak quality alone. I typically want to lick my plate at Nook but this wasn't the case the plate left the table with half a steak, lots of fat pieces and almost all the potatoes.  

This location charges more for the same dishes, understandably they are in the hotel, it is bigger and they likely have more expenses, however I was a little surprised to see the same Chicken Marsala offered at Arcadia was $5 more here.  

The valet parking is also expensive, $17 normally, $12 if you eat at the restaurant and get a stamp.  Find a parking spot if you can and don't valet, this isn't Nook's fault, just a tip.

If it weren't for the olives and pizza this would sadly be a 2 star review for me. Service was good."}
{"text":"Tasty food, done right, and everything here just feels and tastes like it's done with passion.  

My go-to here is the Filet.  I am always a little apprehensive of a $28 filet but I tired it on my first visit and didn't stray from it for the next three meals here because it was so good and I was afraid I would be disappointed with anything else. 

Fighting the selfish need for food satisfaction I decided to venture out and tried the Chicken Marsala and I have to say it was totally on par with the Filet, I was not disappointed at all. The flavors here taste like the best home cooked meal and again like someone actually cares about the food. I've now had the Marsala several times and it's been amazing each time. So five stars for consistently impressing. 

Last night I ventured out again and while I typically get the artichoke appetizer, I think it's seriously one of the best artichokes in town, sadly they were out. Again scared to be disappointed we reluctantly ordered the Arancini and the Wood Fired Olives. The Arancini was moist and the accompanying balsamic sauce was the brilliant and made the dish shine. They were devoured in about 2 minutes. 

However, the HIGHLIGHT of my food adventure here has to be these damn olives. I am a fan a green olives but this is not a dish I would typically order just by reading it on the menu.  Green olives sautéed in olive oil in the wood oven with tiny bits of soppressata sausage.  They are served hot in the EVOO with a crostini to dip. I have never had olives prepared this way they were warm and tender and basically almost falling off the pit. The saltiness of the olives with the warm buttery goodness of the oil was melt in you mouth amazing. Simple and delicious. 

EAT HERE, it's not fancy but the food will not disappoint. It's down home good. The pizza, my boyfriends staple, is also super delicious."}
{"text":"Very impressed!
Party of 2. Decor is very cute. 

I had the pizza - one of the best pies i've ever had. Just light and perfect blend of cheese and sauce

We also got the filet and was perfection.

We are definitely coming back again. Service was great as well!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the original nook a few times and liked it, so you can imagine that I was excited for a location to open closer to my neighborhood. The decor of this location is very inviting and modern. A friend and I came late ish at night and split their calabrese pizza with the sausage and caramelized onions....so good! If definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour! The Husband and I went and got arancini, poutine, and a margherita pizza.....I was expecting the happy hour portions to be tiny...they were HUGE! There were like 8 arancini balls and they were some of the best I have had....crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, and (best of all) the rice still had some texture like a good risotto should. The balls come on top of some wonderful marinara and a balsamic sauce. The poutine I did not LOVE, but it was a huge portion and was good....just got soggy in areas. The pizza was very good. We also had kronenburg beer for 2$/pint. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Go! Go! You WILL NOT be disappointed.  In fact, the clever menu, the surprising spices, the agreeable staff, the desire to truly please the customer means WE will be back!  Often!"}
{"text":"It was my friend's choice for dinner one lovely evening...

So to start, of course I had to order wine to go with my pizza. I got the Picket Fence Pinot Noir. This was quite tasty. I ordered the Calabrese pizza. This comes with mozzarella, Tallegio, Parmesan, caramelized onions, sausage, chilies, basil and olive oil. I loved it! I added prosciutto to it, but I think they forgot to put it on. =/

I always think it's really odd when pizza places don't have ranch. I always mention this because I love ranch w/ my pizza. & what do they serve with their salads then? Since they didn't have ranch, the owner brought us this creamy Gorgonzola sauce. I'm not sure what's in it, but ask them for it! He even offered to whip something else up if I didn't like it. 

The best part besides the food was the owner always came out to make sure we had everything we needed and even introduced himself. I call that very good customer service. They would get a five star from me if they had ranch. Also, it was a bit hard to find, because all the signs in that shopping center are the same color so it blends in. The place was a bit small but cozy. Good for dinner with a friend or a date. They have a happy hour! I'll be back for that!"}
{"text":"Went here last night and used the convenience of yelp reservations in reserving a table for 4. Been here b4 for their amazing brunch but was my first time trying for dinner. I started off w a glass of prosecco which comes in an individual orange small bottle which reminded me of veuve champagne. And as appetizers, we got the shrimp cocktail and the short rib bruschetta. The shrimp cocktail came w 4 jumbo tiger shrimp which was perfect for the 4 of us. The short rib bruschetta was amazing!! 4 pieces of bruschetta topped with hearty portions of short ribs. It was soooo good!! Will definitely have to come here again for this paired w wine. For my entree, I got the shrimp fra diavolo which has jumbo shrimp, linguine, white wine, red pepper, Calabrian chilies, garlic and crushed tomatoes which gave it a spicy kick. It was good but wasn't amazing... the sauce was a little bland but was decent enough to eat. Next time will definitely try the short ribs or scallops instead. My husband got the chicken Marsala and our two friends got the Nook spiced airline chicken and the cowboy ribeye. From what I could see and a little taste of everyone's dishes, everything was amazing!!! My husband's chicken Marsala was to die for!! The sauce and chicken was cooked to perfection!!! Yum!! And our server was perfect!! Will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Nook is one of my favorite restaurants!  The food is always incredible.  The Arrancini and Diavalo pizza are a must!  Also anything with their short-rib is superb.  Don't leave without trying one of their amazing desserts as well!"}
{"text":"Wait staff is awesome. Friendly, helpful and efficient.  Atmosphere is really cute and the lighting is perfect. Happy hour has phenomenal deals and the food is superb! We had arancini, poutine and bruchetta appetizers. All so good that we couldn't fit in the delicious looking pizza we had been eyeballing all night. You can watch it come right out of the oven while you're dining. Great wine selection and tasty after dinner coffee drinks as well. This is on my return list for sure."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Nook, and the experience was great. The ambiance was trendy but comfortable. Upon being seated, the owner came to our table to thank us for choosing Nook.  He also came by on his way out to ensure that everything was to our satisfaction! Our server was equally attentive and made excellent recommendations. I can't say enough about the service. We also mentioned that it was our anniversary and were surprised with a free dessert! For dinner, we ordered a salad, pizza and three types of bruschetta: short rib, braised pork, and fig. The salad was not particularly spectacular, but the bruschetta and the pizza were wonderful and inventive. We will be returning often."}
{"text":"Great little romantic spot in Arcadia. Excellent pizza and good variety of wines. I went on a Tuesday night and they had live music which was really nice and unique since most restaurants in the area don't. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was really tasty. Nice environment. The wait staff was very friendly and responsive. A little pricey but not too far off for being in a hotel."}
{"text":"Loved it. Had the bruschetta, artichoke and a pizza. Was fabulous. Just need to get the AC fixed. It was hot"}
{"text":"I have always been a pizza connoisseur.  I must say out of all of the places to get Artisan style pizza in the PHX, that Nook is my favorite!!  The sweet sausage with the caramelized onion combination is Fantastic with the Pork and Fungi not far behind.  Check out Nook for a delicious artisan style pie!"}
{"text":"Great short ribs.  Some of the best I've ever had. Melt in the mouth.  Wow.  My wife ate light tonight: fig bruschetta and an arugula salad.  Though not my favorites but she loved them both
The service: prompt and friendly    The atmosphere:   Cool.  Nice bar.  Great beers.  Not too loud even with a full house of guests.  Next time in Scottsdale we will return.  Please try this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Nook and it was another great experience. 

My first time to Nook I ordered the Pork Chop entree and it is probably the best pork chop I've ever had. Large portion, tender, lots of flavor.. really couldn't ask for anything else. The sides that came with it were also perfect pairings.

My second visit I ordered the Diavolo pizza. I really wanted to order the pork chop again but the pictures of the Pizza looked great and I had to order that. The diavolo had fresh mozzarella, soppressata, red sauce and EVOO. It was great. 

The next time we visit Nook, it'll be a hard choice on what to order."}
{"text":"Before reading any further. This restaurant warrants a second try. The food was great and service was attentive. I was soured by the experience by one pretty big misstep, that I truly believe happens once in a blue moon.

The restaurant itself is tucked away in the middle of a strip mall in the heart of Arcadia. It's one of the many restaurants in the area that are easy to dismiss or drive by altogether without stopping inside. Once inside though, it exudes personality. It's designed as if it's an Italian wine bar - A nice concept and well executed. It would be an excellent choice as a date night.

I had the chance to try both the Chicken Marsala and the Pasta Crepe dishes, both of which the waiter recommended as the best dishes on the menu. The Crepe was described as basically a pan-fried patty of pasta. The chicken was then layered on top of the pasta. It tasted great, if only slightly under-salted. The Chicken Marsala was terrific, had it been cooked. I tasted the pasta first, which was perfectly al-dente, but upon cutting in to the chicken, the center was raw. The staff was extremely apologetic - Both the server and the chef came over to apologize, which was nice. Once the replacement came out, I've got to say that the dish still managed to pass my expectations. If only they got it right on the first try!

Nook would have straight-up gotten a 4 star rating had they fully cooked the chicken. I was a little disappointing that they knocked off a beer instead of comping the Marasala. Either way, the service and food turned out to be great. Definitely worth a second try."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for dinner on a whim. Our waitress was fantastic with recommending everything from appetizers to drinks and desserts. We had soup, an appetizer, the filet (melt in your mouth delicious), a pizza, and a dessert. Also had two classes of wine, a cocktail and a beer. Every single item was absolutely delicious. We will definitely be back over and over again."}
{"text":"I came here a first timer, I had never been to the Arcadia location so I cannot compare the two. This place had a nice ambience and romantic window seats that allow you to look at the night's lights. So we came in and tried the caprese bruschetta which was really great but then again it's hard to go wrong with that. Now as far as the entrees, the chicken Marsala was really good! The salmon however was not worth the money, I wouldn't recommend it. It lacked the proper seasoning and taste that I expected for $30. BUT the best part was the butter cake dessert. Which is my favorite dessert I've tried at a restaurant."}
{"text":"We found this cute place by luck!  The service was great. We just shared a pizza and it was a perfect wood fired pie. Will be back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Great pizza, and this place is up there with the best. First night, I was a skeptic and I needed another night, but tonight it was pretty good!

Attentive hostess, both nights, and very friendly with a \"nice to meetcha, glad you're here\" kind of welcome...I like that. Being A one-man show, I wasn't sure about taking up an entire booth, but I was treated as if I owned the place, \"wow, cool\"!

Menu simple, and if there's a question, ask and the Italian will be explained to you, but I'm finding that no better lesson is just diving in, so that's why I'm making it a point to keep coming back and trying every damn thing on the menu until I learn first hand what I'm eating. Actually, here's a tip...when the owner asks how the meal is, don't give a one word answer, he really cares...give him your input; you'll be pleasantly amazed at HIS input and suggestions on what's good...I like this place!

As I often attest to in my reviews, it's not necessarily the food, but the manners, and personality that it's served with...the Nook is that kind of place. I'll be back, and oh by the way, the decorations personally hung by the owner, Frank, for Christmas, deserves a applause!"}
{"text":"Chicken Chop salad is good ... Waitresses are nice the mgr comes around... Had the salad last two nights"}
{"text":"This is the most delicious pizza I've ever had in my life. I completely lost control of my arms as they were uncontrollably feeding the decadent slices into my mouth. But seriously, best pizza ever."}
{"text":"This place was such a nice surprise! We were craving Italian but so many good restaurants are closed on Sundays. Nook, OPEN and 1/2 off bottles of wine! There were a few TVs with baseball on which was great. The environment was laid back but casually elegant. In other words, with the right person, this place can be either romantic or fun or both! We started with a charcuterie board which featured, some nice meats and 2 cheeses, olives and spreads. Very good. I had a mixed greens salad with red wine vinaigrette. Very fresh tasting, simple but good. For the entrees, he had the Diavolo pizza. It wasn't amazing but pretty good when I tried a bite.I like my pizza a little crispier. I had the chicken marsala which was very good. It was made with Gran Marnier and you could taste the sweetness through the marsala sauce. Everything arrived promptly. There weren't that many people there but a few came after we did. The waiter I think was Ralph and he was very friendly and helpful with the menu. The wine list is nothing special but there are a couple good ones. The one we tried was the Yangarra Grenache which we both felt was flat with no lustre, no finish. But at least it was half  off.  I know the bottles of wine were half off that time on Sunday so I am curious to see what other specials they have as I'm sure I would go back."}
{"text":"The reviews were accurate.  Great drinks, variety of appetizers and a really good dinner.  The chicken Marsala, hands down perfect.  Service is tops. Best part is the Art Deco building.  Have a post-dinner drink on the rooftop bar (13th floor)."}
{"text":"This place was great!! We just walked in at 630 tonight and had to wait 15 minutes,  no big deal. The darling hostess told us when there was a table available and she just needed to clean it which was a nice heads up. We got a nice booth, great atmosphere etc... our server Nicholas came over promptly and got us a bottle of Sardo (delicious)  and the grilled artichoke and hummus platter. This is where the lost 5th star comes in. The hummus plate is served with 2 scoops of hummus, garlic oil, tzaziki, fried garbanzo beans,  carrots, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and 4 strips of bread. Like 1 piece in 4 strips. They charge of you ask for 4 more skinny little strips. (which we did twice). There was just so much to dip, but no bread. Bread doesnt cost that much, serve a basket with that particular app. To charge $1 is almost insulting, like neither of us, the owner nor me and my friends could afford it. The artichoke was still a bit hard but tasty nonetheless. Lemon aioli was spot on. Not too lemony. Now...the pizza was fantastic. Nice crunch to chewy dough ratio. We got a Divola (sp) with spicy soprassata and a red sauce and a white pizza with fontina and sausage on it. Both were just divine!! We all loved them so much. For dessert, we had a fruity pebble cake thing. Not the best thing I've ever had but certainly not the worst. The overall experience was great. We had good company, great food and wonderful service. Thanks guys, we'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The $5 Pinot Noir on happy hour is great!  Every single thing I've ordered has been completely delicious.  The bruschettas are awesome and I love their pizzas.  Everything is so fresh.  The wait staff is super friendly and eager to serve.  Go eat at Nook!"}
{"text":"Much better neighborhood alternative to lgNo!, fox, etc. reasonable prices, Nice mgmt/waitstaff & good concept!"}
{"text":"Very cool new spot downtown. Pizza was delicious :) awesome spot and scenery. Outdoor patio, and cool inside decor"}
{"text":"We LOVE the Nook Kitchen, Nick, Ryan, Drew, Victoria and the whole crew! 

The Nook is the perfect combo of neighborhood watering hole and a sweet, romantic, upscale joint. It is perfect for special occasions, entertaining guests or simply enjoying happy hour with friends. 

For dinner, the chicken masala gets three thumbs-up. Wow! It's really out of this world delicious. Ask for the wine pairing to go with this dish. It is large Enough to share, if you go in for that sort of thing, making it perfect for a full evening of cocktails (I love the deconstructed mule, very refreshing), appetizers (the olives are delightful! Served warm, drenched in hot olive oil...stop!), dinner with a bottle of wine (ask for the perfect pairing), dessert and coffee. Yeah, all that. 

To top it off, everyone will make you feel warmly welcomed and a part of the neighborhood. 

Much thanks to Nick for pulling together the perfect blend of ambiance, personality and good vibrations. 

Now, if they could update the speaker system, it would be heaven. Until then, I'll settle for a slice of paradise."}
{"text":"First, let me say that Nook has one of the most impeccable wait staffs in Phoenix. Drinks are always refilled immediately, plates are cleared off the table right away and they check on you just the right amount (enough to be helpful, not often enough to be annoying). 

The prices are reasonable, especially at happy hour (do yourself a favor and order the $2 beer option at HH--I can't remember the name, but it is delicious and SO affordable). We've tried several pizzas, salads and appetizers and you really cannot make a bad choice. I think my favorites are the arancini and fungi pizza.  

Also, my boyfriend and I really like the music they play here (not important to everyone but important to us) and its fun to sit at the bar or a table nearby and watch the pizza chef do his thang.

All in all, a great neighbor joint that we will continue to frequent!"}
{"text":"With less than an hour before our show we asked our waitress if we had time for dinner. She told us what dishes could be made quickly and got us fed and on our way on time. Diavolo pizza, diavolo shrimp pasta, short rib bruschetta, poutine and raspberry beret cocktails were all super delicious!"}
{"text":"What a great little restaurant to stumble upon in downtown Phoenix. Located next to the Hilton lobby is this awesome restaurant with excellent service, perfect ambiance, and delicious cocktails. I had a Moscow mule infused with hibiscus and lavender, one of the best mules I've ever had and a mint julep in honor of the Kentucky Derby which was on the day spotted Nook Kitchen. For food I had the Calabrese pizza and tried the poutine which we added a fried egg to as well as short ribs. Both were delicious. Can't wait to go back because I regret not having the Charcuterie paired with a good bottle of wine and the beer braised pork butt bruschettas."}
{"text":"This place is inside the Hilton and is nice place to have a quick drink. The menu is very limited but the food is good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice meal at the bar. The service was excellent and friendly. The atmosphere was also very pleasant. I had the meatball appetizer and their Eggplant Main Course. The Eggplant presentation was tremendous with a tower of sliced eggplant layered with cheese. Both items were very good but lacked some flavor. Not sure if it was me having a bad night or the kitchen but I was expecting more flavor from both dishes. All else was excellent!"}
{"text":"We went to Nook tonight,the Friday night of the week they were featured on Check Please, a TV restaurant show. We were told it was a nice quiet place with great pizza. It certainly has great pizza among other things, but not close to quiet during our visit. The hostess was superb and \", in spite of the crush we got seats at the bar in about 10 minutes. A good wine list and a small draught selection, but beers you don't see everywhere. 

We had one of those experiences a that shows what owners are made. We had a great fig bruschetta to start. We ordered one of their white pizzas. I noticed when theirs came out that the couple next to us got the same pizza we ordered. About 5 minutes later a pizza was presented to us that wasn't what we ordered. It quickly became clear we had been served the pizza those next to us had ordered. They had ours. The owners quickly offered us a round of drinks and ordered up another pie for us. After a couple of slices of the pizza they ordered, our new friend assured us we had made the better call. When our came after profuse apologies from the owner, we were very pleased with our selection. Fantastic pizza. Bianca with sweet sausage. Our next door neighbors offered to buy us ours but no need. Our free round of drinks cost more than the pie. 

It isn't about the mistake, we all make them. It's about the recovery, and the Nook Kitchen owners did great. We'll be back. Great service and superb food. What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"This is our go to neighborhood gem. It's relaxed, the bar has sports on the tvs and a fantastic menu. Their pizzas are exquisite with flavorful, crispy crust and flavor profiles that are unique but not over the top. The Poutine appetizer and their bolognese are delicious! On the pizza side of the equation, the Porco y Funghi and the Calabrese are two of our faves. Servers are amazing too, particularly Ali who always remembers us and is very attentive."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem in Phoenix. I'm not sure why I haven't heard of it sooner. My husband surprised me by taking me here for our anniversary. The food is wonderful and the ambiance is swanky, I highly recommend coming here. I love bruschetta, my favorite is probably Postinos or Olive and Ivy, the Nook surprised me by beating out them both with their artichoke bruschetta. It's a must order. I had the short rib as my meal and the meat was high quality and cooked perfectly, the flavor was exactly as it should be, rich and warm. Their service is also really good, our waitress was attentive and unobtrusive. Their prices are fair and not too high. This is a great date night place! I am getting hungry writing this review and really want to go back soon!"}
{"text":"The best french fries ever! We had the grilled salmon with some grilled squash and zucchini with a basil reduction and some olive oil.  They company and cauliflower was well peppered and beautifully textured. If ever in Phoenix again I would love to come back here and sit try all the other delicious things I saw on the menu. Victoria is the worlds best waitress ever!

The wine is exquisite. The stemware is Riedel. That says it all."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza. It was pretty tasty. But the service was very slow. For the prices, I expect a refill of a soft drink without being asked (and I wasn't asked until just before the check arrived). In the end, I felt it was a little overpriced for what we got. Maybe that's how everything is downtown, but I could take it or leave."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST gluten free crust in all Phoenix! I have not stopped dreaming with that pizza ever since I tasted it. I even had mine without cheese, I can only imagine what it would taste like with cheese and a normal crust!!! It makes me so jealous!!! Jaja! 

No for real though, my pizza was truly, truly one of the best I've had in long time and I'm counting the days to go back! I had the one with artichoke hearts, (I can't remember the name) it was actually supposed to have 4 cheeses on in it, and as I mentioned already, I had the cheese removed and added sausage....let me tell you, it was heaven on earth! I got my pizza fix for at least a year! Fortunately I won't have to wait that long to go back, teehee.

Besides the insane pizza flavors, on Sundays you can get any bottle of wine for half off...that's right, ANY BOTTLE half off..... So, my friend and I split an $80 bottle for 40, which means we each paid 20 for a bottle we would never buy otherwise! Well, I think it was a sweet deal...was it worth it? YES. 

Service was suuuuuper friendly and helpful, from the Maitre'D to our waiter, everyone was eager for us to enjoy our experience.

Can NOT wait for next time!!"}
