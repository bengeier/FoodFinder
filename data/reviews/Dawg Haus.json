{"text":"True Chicago dog! All vegetables taste fresh. Every bite was delicious. Great spot for before or after movies. Very friendly and quick. Definitely will recommend it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Chicago hotdog then this is the place for you! Like most, I came here to get a quick bite before my movie. We got the Chicago dog and the Hawaiian dog as well. I loved both of them! The man at the counter was very kind! The service was quick and I'm very satisfied. Many may come here a bit nervous since it isn't a well-known business, but I assure you, this is a place that will not let you down! I'll definitely be coming here from now on!"}
{"text":"I ate here last week before hitting a movie.  They are located inside the Texas Station food court.  I'm a bit of a hot dog snob and love a good brat or juicy kosher dog.  This place has genuinely good food and fast service.  Time from order to eating was less than 5 minutes.  There's nothing better than a good brat with kraut and deli mustard, or a fat chili dog (my wife's choice).  I was burping it up for the next 2 hours.  It's like a meal that you get to eat over and over again.   Anyway, good hot dogs and brats at Dawg Haus.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is really really bad. DO NOT GO.... They use can chilli, caned liquid cheese, everything you can taste is from a can.. Nothing Fresh... The hot dog tasted like rubber and the dont grill them. They boil them in fatty luke warm water...Really Gross...."}
