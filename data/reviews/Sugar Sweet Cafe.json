{"text":"The food is really good and pretty consistent ...... I would recommend anyone that is nearby to try it out.  

Must Try Dishes:
Pork Chop Rice with Tomato Sauce on Spaghetti or Rice
Black Pepper Chicken on Spaghetti or Rice
Salmon with Mushroom and Chicken on Spaghetti/Rice

They have these new waiters that I dislike because they rush everything the minute you sit down.  I would say I'm a regular at this place and I haven't been disappointed yet.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I love visiting the Sugar Sweet Cafe. It's a typical but quality Hong Kong-style restaurant with tasty dishes that come with soup and a drink (on their lunch and dinner menu. Just a drink for breakfast). A quaint little place to have breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea or dinner."}
{"text":"They have the worse hot and sour soup. Not fresh and bad combination of ingredientes. Also ordered a fried rice and it doesn't taste great. Will not go back n not recommended. Not real Chinese food."}
{"text":"One of the best HK style cafe for lunch in GTA.  Prices are average for HK cafe. It's not dirt cheap.  

However, the food is high quality here. 

Must try their Bitter Melon with pork neck meat  with black bean sauce on rice.  Amazing.  Probably the best pork I have ever had.  Also try their beef short ribs on rice with peppered sauce.  The short ribs are super yummy!   For afternoon tea try their chicken wings with fries."}
{"text":"This is where my friends and I come for something quick and easy. 

If you are looking to get your moneys worth. This is the place! Huge portions and you get soup, dessert and a drink for under $10.00. MIND BLOWN! Don't get me wrong...sometimes it is a hit or miss BUT majority of their food there is a HIT. If you are use to eating \"fast food\" Chinese style café food this is the place for you!

They have amazing HK style milk tea and their menu is full of different varieties that you can try! Friendly service and definitely a place that I would continue to go to!"}
{"text":"My go to spot for HK cafe style food. The only dish I order is the baked pork chop rice, so I can't comment on the other dishes...but the baked pork chop rice is SO GOOD. I've had it in so many resots, including in HK and this place is still my favourite. 

Portions are large! For $9 you get a soup, the entree, a drink AND a dessert (dinner hours). Can't be beat!!

Service is fine - what you expect for a Chinese place. They're pretty quick and decently friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great for quick lunch and dinner.  Similar to many Hong Kong style tea restaurants.  Prices are pretty cheap and amounts are big.  It can get crowded sometimes but it is a pretty clean restaurant.  This is not a desert place.  Totally recommend for rice and noodle dishes!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, as with the service. The only negative thing I remember about the place is the cleanliness.

A bit dirty compared to other restaurants nearby, but the prices are simply unbeatable."}
{"text":"Love this place, small but the foods are tasty.  My son love the baked pork chop rice so much. good portion reasonable price.  The mixed vegetable soup is great.  The waitress are friendly."}
{"text":"The place here is no good.  The food portions are small (breakfast) compared to others and prices aren't that cheap. 

Food have no flavor, so blend....Milk tea is WATERY!

This cafe will be removed from my list. Won't return!"}
{"text":"Sugar Sweet Café is a very solid Chinese restaurant if you want cheap and filling Chinese food. It has more of a HK café style. So, with under or a little over $10, you can get yourself a soup, drink of choice, and a generous portion of food. I normally come here for their stir fry beef with gravy on rice. Although the price point is very reasonable, and everything is served in a timely manner, nothing else really makes this place stand out."}
{"text":"I've been eating at sugar sweet cafe for many years and it use to be my favourite tsa tsan tang. Recently, I think the pork cutlets are slowly getting smaller... and it is no longer a part of the get a free drink and soup deal. 
I think what changed my mind completely about coming here more often was this one time, me and 3 other friends decided to eat some spaghetti meat sauce. The waitress was extremely rude that day and our food took more than an hour to arrive. I remember we asked for water so she grabbed all our teas roughly and slammed our water on the table. Noticeably upset that we asked for water. 
It just wasn't cool, and we felt very mistreated.
I want to give this place a 2 star but my recent visit was Gucci, except how the pork cutlet shrunk by 3\"."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite Hong Kong style cafe at the moment. As a frequently traveller to Hong Kong. I could not find a place that brings me memory of Hong Kong cafes and the same quality.

Until now. 

Baked porkchops (5/5) 
The baked porkchops rice was the best I ever had. Better than the one in Hong Kong. Definitely their signature dish. 

Pork chop was crispy, the sauce was muli-layered.  It goes beyond your typical Portuguese sauce. 

I'm estatic for my friend to bring me to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"A small chinese cafe thats hidden in a small plaza along steeles ave e. Its a pretty traditional chinese cafe thats very small and has very limited seats. Breakfast and lunch time can yield 15-20 minute waits. The food is pretty cheap and the portions are pretty good for the price. The food comes pretty quickly and the servers are attentive and respond pretty quickly. Come here quite often for breakfast or tea time, as they have a deal where it comes with a drink for a cheap price."}
{"text":"Cheap Hong Kong style cafe food a few minutes from my home? This place was an easy sell. I've been here twice over the last week with friends and the food is pretty good, cheap, and comes out fast. 
So far my favourite dish was a fried u-don noodle and shredded beef dish. It's huge, has plenty of beef, egg, and bean sprouts, and comes with soup, Hong Kong style tea and dessert. 
These are large portions, so expect some leftovers to take home. Also, it's cash only, so bear that in mind. 
I'll definitely be back again and if I find a couple more good dishes I'll bump my score up a bit."}
{"text":"To be honest i think this place is really more of a 3.5, but no half stars on yelp so oh well :) Anyways, I would say this is my go to HK style cafe, just b/c it's not ridiculously over priced, and the food is actually pretty good when you know what to order. Now here's where it gets tricky. This cafe does certain things really well (ex. baked porkchop and fried rice), while other items will make you never want to return (ex. beef in black pepper sauce with rice, which had a really crappy sauce). 

In terms of setting, it is a pretty typical HK style cafe: bustling, busy, loud and run by chinese housewives (si lais) who really don't care for their quality of service.  Though these things may be seen as negative to some, for many who have been to HK, this might actually feel familiar and welcoming. 

Overall this is a good place to go to every now and then. Just avoid lunch times and weekends 'cause the restaurant is REALLY small, and it is quite popular."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is not. When we came here there was this constant banging noise coming from the kitchen that the staff did nothing about. Also there was this waitress who clearly did not know the menu or how the restaurant worked because she told us that one of our entrees came with soup and a drink when it did not."}
{"text":"Alas, I have returned to see how the establishment is doing.. and I'm actually really glad to say that they've improved! I suspect that they had a change in management because all of the employees are different now. They're more polite and mannerly - definitely a step up from the ones before!

In respect to this restaurant, it's a worthwhile experience. Their food is pretty good and they charge it at a decent price. The whole package would be having the service too, which they do now, so I'd say they deserve a 4 star rating. 

They gave us a complimentary dessert (mango pudding) at the end which was nice, but too bad it didn't taste that great."}
{"text":"Customer service: horrible 
All the waitress will respond to customers this way \" wait (and walk away)\" when they make a request or place order. 

Food quality: soso
Nothing impressive. It is a below average Hong Kong style cafe. I ordered a chicken pineapple fried rice and wonton beef brisket rice noodle. The rice came before the noodle. We waited for 20min, and asked where is my wonton noodle? They said \"wonton will take a while, there is no way to rush\" when the noodle came , there were 2 pieces of wonton in it only. 2 pieces of wonton took 20min to make. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since before I can remember because its literally walking distance from my house, quality is above average I usually get the baked pork chop on rice (with tomato sauce) which comes with a soup and drink, no complaints but at the same time theres no frills about the food either. huge filling portions are less than 10 dolllaaz, ive tried an extend of the menu and everything is usually pretty spot on on what its suppose to taste (and look) like.

the restaurant is usually pretty clean but they do get very busy during lunch rush so sometimes they might miss a spot or two but its tolerable. the washrooms on the other hand are a little less tolerable (not horribly gross but not really maintained either) 

the service is mehh and very typical chinese nothing out of the ordinary, you came for the price and quality (more like quantity) of food not the service so who really cares haha."}
{"text":"A very small HK style cafe located in a plaza that looks quite dingy.

Come before 11:30 am and you can get the breakfast prices! My mom and I came for breakfast and for 5.99 i got a scramble egg sandwich, a satay beef vermicelli noodle soup and hk milk tea. They have a lot of morning specials and for that price you can't go wrong!

Service is quick and efficient (once you order the food will come in 10 minutes). Staff is also very friendly (a bunch of middle age asian ladies who seem to enjoy what they're doing). It can get busy as you get closer to lunch time because they also have set lunch menus as well. Also been here for afternoon tea. Prices are a little big higher than breakfast but items are almost (if not the same) as the breakfast menu. HK style toast here was also very good and for 3.99 you get that plus a hk milk tea. 

A hidden gem and a local favourite if you're craving for some HK style cafe and not want to go  far up markham for the chain HK style cafes."}
{"text":"**ATTENTION** please DO NOT sit in the corner spots during the evenings. Little cockroach-lings cling to the wall and wandering across.

Came here to meet a friend. Not my first time here, except the last time I came was during the afternoon. This time, however, was during the evening. I think I won't be coming back again, unfortunately.

The food itself was flawless.. Blast of flavour, came out smokin hot and fresh! The only issue was the zerg infestation in this restaurant. No matter how good the food was, I can't get passed that.. Hate roaches with a passion, so hard to get rid of those little turds.

I urge all yelpers out there, if you're squeamish about critters.. Make sure you don't visit during the evening. But if your love for food compels you, be prepared for some serious kick ass food!!

-2 stars for bug infestation.. I would've thought ministry of health would clear it before opening..?"}
{"text":"This is a good place for authentic HK style cafe food. We've tried the baked pork chop and hainanese chicken and both were fantastic. Though we've come here a couple times and the food isn't always consistent, especially when it gets busy, but still good nonetheless. The baked pork chop was crispy and precut so made it easy to eat, and there was just enough sauce over the rice where it wasn't overwhelming. The dish comes with a soup and drink. I found the cold milk tea to be a tad too sweet but the cold lemon tea was delish. Brings back memories of HK"}
{"text":"Sugar Sweet has become one of my recent favourites. I found this place over the summer and has now become part of my daily life lol. I like it because (1) it's my fave cuisine, HK style (2) big portions at a reasonable price (3) wide variety of menu options (4) sets come with soup & drink (5) milk tea is good (strong) (6) quick & simple. 

I can't really recommend anything in particular because everything on the menu is a HK staple, you can't really go wrong. Special mention to their curry dishes - many people seem to come here for those. It gets quite packed here during peak hours doing local business. You'll see a mix of solo eaters to families in the after-school hours. It's the typical straight-forward \"get things done\" HK service, so don't expect much hospitality, although I already think they are nicer than most. You'll be full for sure. A lot of the time I even see the locals bring their Tupperware to take home extras. A very practical place, just the way I like it."}
{"text":"As much as I like value-plus portions, I felt something was missing.
It could've been cos' there's so many customers, kitchen overwhelmed.
One day I was amazed by the plentiful portion of Noodles in the bowl.
Another day I look at the sad Sauce poured on separately cooked Meat.
For now, I designate this a fill-d-stomach on cheap destination is all.  2.5'd"}
{"text":"Was there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Portions are huge and comes with a soup, dish, and drink. We got curry chicken with rice. Curry was creamy and rice to curry proportion was good. Had Bolognese spaghetti as well. Sauce was a little on the tomato-y side but still good. By the time we left at around 3 pm there was already a line-up for afternoon tea. Service was good, but as you would expect at a typical Chinese Cha Chan Tang."}
{"text":"Pretty standard HK cafe with lots of seating, clean seats, neat local restaurant.

I decided to try this place out as I got curious, as one of my friends is a frequent customer. Came here around 6PM before busy dinner time. Food was prepared quickly, servings are a good size.

Got the corned beef sandwich $3.75 and my fiance got the round noodle with bbq pork combo $7.99 (comes with soup and your choice of coffee/tea).

Food was alright, however they have forgotten to give us the soup that came with the combo. Also when we came in, our table didn't have the menus, so I'd have to go out and get them myself. Service is lacking here.

Over-all, just ok.

Review 81 of 100"}
{"text":"I get take out from here quite often-- good food, awesome portions and great price. Today, took the kids here for an early dinner and since we ordered before 5:30pm we were able to order the afternoon tea menu which all include a drink. 

For our family of four we ordered fish balls with macaroni noodles, fried chicken wings with fries, ham and egg sandwich and French toast. So much food!

Breakfast is another great bargain, but you have to get here before 11:30am and beat the crowds for a seat. 

Lunch is also awesome with many meals accompanied by soup and drinks. 

Basically, amazing food all day long, at the right price! Huge portions, fast service!"}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable. Portions are good. Service was rather good as well, but that might just have been because the people I went with are regulars and seem to know the boss lady. I ordered the tomato pork chop baked rice ($8.99?) and it was not as sweet as I'd have liked the sauce to be. I like mine sweet and junky. This was a tad too strong on the tomato sauce for me. I think I had to pay extra for Horlicks. At least they had Horlicks. 

Overall, it wasn't outstanding, but it's a safe choice."}
{"text":"My go to breakfast every Saturday morning ham instant noodle, condense milk toast with milk tea. Although their milk tea is not the best but it's still ok.

The prices here are the most reasonable!!"}
{"text":"My go to place for HK style food because their portions are big and very cheap too. Each dish comes with a soup and your choice of drink for less than $10. Every time I go, it is always packed because everyone loves it and the food is very good. 

It is located in a small plaza so parking can be difficult since there are other businesses with limited parking. I recommend ordering their baked or curry dishes because there are a lot of flavour and lots of cheese!!!"}
{"text":"Let's kick start 2015 with a review to a restaurant I had been going occasionally for the past 4 years.  Sugar Sweet Cafe is located in a very small plaza on Steeles, which normally you would think it does not generate enough traffic considering it is relatively close to Pacific Mall.  You are WRONG, this place is packed ALL THE TIME and with the limited parking spots available, it could cause some problems on nights during weekends.

Food had always been consistent with this place although there are many competitors that popped up within the last few years.  Any of their baked dishes with rice or spaghetti would satisfy your Chinese cafe cravings!  With three dinner and lunch menus to choose from, you can pretty much order any food you can think of from a Chinese Cafe.  I personally always go with the Smoked Salmon Chicken Stripes White Sauce Fettuccine or when they do have it, the Corn Sauce Filet/Shrimps on rice, both to me, are top notch.

In terms of their drinks, it's really a hit or miss depending who is at the bar that day.  85% of the time their drinks are pretty good, but I notice when the bar is operated by this specific lady, then your typical milk tea would taste super bitter.  But the good news is, I don't think that lady works there anymore so your drinks should be good 95% of the time!

This place deserves a solid 4 stars out of 5 because of the quality of food they bring to their customers at a relatively competitive price."}
{"text":"I had a vet appointment and I had a bit of time to spare so I decided to eat here for breakfast. Generally, it's pretty okay. I ordered the U breakfast set which was just the classic instant noodle. It came with this condensed milk toast. The instant noodle was actually a bit too undercooked for me. A little longer would have been nice. Taste wise, it is just like any other restaurant that serves it. Usually, it comes with egg but THERE WASNT ONE IN THIS ONE?!?! HOW COULD THEY DISGRACE ME LIKE THAT?!? Jokes, but really. The toast is fine. I'm not really a fan of having sweet things for breakfast but it's nice. I also ordered this Honey Lemon Tea and ehh...they were quite stingy with the honey. It was sour af. LOL 

Service was mediocre. Nothing spectacular. 
But yeAh, still an okay place for breakfast. It was actually quite packed (full of regulars and locals) when I went."}
{"text":"Sugar Sweet Cafe is one of the most under-rated HK style restaurants in the Markham/Scarobough area. It is tucked away in a small plaza consisting of a gas station, bakery and several clinics. 

The restaurant itself is quite small, seating approx. 20 small tables/booths, so it can get quite crowded during the peak hours of lunch and dinner time. 

There are daily lunch/dinner specials, along with the regular selections from the menu. The daily lunch/dinner specials come with a choice of soup (Tomato or cream of mushroom), a drink (hot HK tea, coffee, or lemon tea), and a dessert (only for dinner). 

The selections are standard to HK style restaurants, but Sugar Sweet Cafe doesn't hold back on their portions. I almost away have to share my main dish with my guest. The overall quality and taste is great and it comes at a very affordable price. It holds true to what it does best.

Even the HK tea and lemon tea are quite tasty. 
 
Sugar Sweet Cafe has been one of my top choice for HK style cafe for years and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"when all else fails....this is my hang out..literally 3-4 times a week.  and if you're looking to get your moneys worth, you've come to the best place.  Where else can you get a bowl of soup, entree and dessert for under $8....??? nowhere!
fast, efficient, and yummy for your tummy. its a place you can count on.
The only thing I'd suggest is possibly making some additions to the menu, kinda gets boring ordering the same thing every week....lol.... mmm fan of their HK tea...."}
{"text":"Giving this 2 stars because of service manners. The wifi here is called \"y-5\". Because it sounds like Wi-Fi? Ha...

The food here is pretty good. 6 of us came for breakfast. This area has fairly inexpensive  compared to the heart of Markham. I got H under the breakfast  menu which is beef brisket soup. I substituted the vermicelli for instant  noodles. So good. The pieces are really fatty...eat the meat and throw out the fat! The fat makes the soup yummy, but don't  clog your pipes! The satay noodles  and satay macaroni here is not good. I definitely recommend beef brisket. My noodles were better than everyone else's . 

I also tried the French toast with peanut butter. Very well done. It tastes just like a traditional breakfast  in HK. The milk tea was very rich. 

The bathroom  was bigger than I expected because the seating area was very tight, but the bathroom  was spacious. Lots of parking and a gas station outside."}
{"text":"I was craving some hainanese chicken rice so my friend recommended that we should try this place out since she said it was some bomb diggity rice (and chicken).

I ventured up there and it took me a good hour. I lived an hour away from this place but it was worth the trip since downtown Toronto doesn't have too many Hong Kong style cafe restaurants.

Met up with my friend there and got a table for two.

The restaurant itself is small and tiny, but it was cozy and comfortable. Very asian diner like which I liked. It was busy and had a lot of people bustling about, either waiting for take-out or in line for a table. 

So we both ordered the Hainanese chicken rice. This dish comes with a free drink, so my friend got a tea and I got the Ying Yang drink (really good, it's a mixture of tea and coffee!). After waiting for hours...JUST KIDDING, we only waited for a good couple of minutes and our food came. This is a plus because we were both starving. 

The chicken was standard but it was the rice that made the dish. The rice was really good! Flavourful and soft. This meal itself only costed me $7! That's a crazily good price for the amount of food I got! A bowl of rice, a drink and a plate of chicken. Seriously, why can't they relocate in downtown Toronto...just for me. 

But anyways, overall this place is great if you're looking for cheap eats! I will definitely be back to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"We came here once and ordered take-out, so can't comment much on the service. We needed a quick bite, so we came here. We came on a weekend afternoon, and the place was PACKED. So packed that after we made the order, we had to wait outside for our order. It was a good thing that the weather was nice that day, otherwise waiting outside would not have been fun.

We ordered the curry ox tongue dish as well as the cold milk tea. The ox tongue came in gigantic slabs. Most of it tasted pretty good, the tongue was tender and the curry sauce was quite flavourful. However, there were some pieces of tongue that were super tough and I could barely bite through it, and it got stuck in my teeth. The veggies in the dish had no flavouring, it was your typical frozen vegetables that was probably boiled and then added to the side of the dish. The ice tea was pretty standard.

Overall it was a decent meal for a quick bite and for the price, but I wouldn't seek out this place if I was planning to eat out."}
{"text":"I love their satay beef and egg sandwich combo for breakfast. For 5.99 it also comes with a drink so it's such a great deal. I come here occasionally on saturday mornings to get this deal. I love their satay beef noodle soup. In general it's so good. Majority of other dishes I've tried were not too bad. Some of their pasta dishes were just okay. The baked pork chop with rice is pretty good. But pretty much I come here coz i love the breakfast menu... which brings me to the following issue. The only thing I don't like about this restaurant is that they don't have lunch specials that contain breakfast items or even noodle bowls. A lot is usually pasta and rice dishes. Which is fine for the most part but sometimes I just want a bowl of noodles but at lunch it doesn't come with a drink. Also the place is small and is always busy. If more than 4 or 5 of us are going and that has been the case when we tried to go on a Sunday lunch, it is just too packed to fit large groups of people... Hence I resort to take out now :)"}
{"text":"This place is simple. 

A little dirty. Huge portions. Delicious Food. Ample parking. 

'Nuff said."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place for a while and I finally had a chance to try! 

I came here for dinner. The place wasn't too busy so we got seated immediately. The menu was placed on the side so it was easily accessible. There were a lot of options to choose from so it took a while before we could make a decision.

We decided to try their baked fish fillet with spicy tomato sauce and baked ox-tongue with Portuguese sauce from the \"Chef's Recommendation\".  As we were ordering, the waitress let us know our order included a drink, a soup and a DESSERT! Can't say NO to dessert :D! The only suggestion I would make is that they should clearly state the included items on the menu so customers can make clear decisions before ordering. Also, it was nice for them to let us modify the order. My boyfriend was able to change his order from Portuguese sauce to tomato and I changed mine to spaghetti instead of rice. 

We decided to try their pork bone soup with corn (soup of the day) and hot & sour soup and for drinks we ordered the lemon iced tea (additional $1) and HK milk tea. The soup was pretty good and the drinks were decent. The OX tongue dish came quickly. However, the baked fish fillet took some time to arrive but the wait was totally worth it! The fish fillet was thick & flaky! It was lightly battered and baked perfectly! The tomato sauce along with the crispy layered fish harmonized your taste buds ^^. I wished the sauce was a little bit spicier. On the menu it say \"spicy\" and the spice level was pretty much non-existent =.=\" 

Now for the dessert round. We selected the mango and the milk pudding. They both had intense mango flavour and the puddings had a smooth consistency. The price for our meal was a steal. It cost around $20 for everything we had! 

This HK café had made a spot on my top favourite list! I really enjoy their service and food! There are still so many other food items I would like to try! This place is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Came here for their breakfast specials which ends at 11:30am

Satay beef with macaroni in soup + scrambled egg sandwich + milk tea $5.99 - what a deal. A healthy portion of satay beef. The eggs were really fluffy and the bread was soft with no crust just the way I like it. 

Service is really fast. Got our food within three minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"breakfast until 11:30 am - really good HK style tea comes with breakfast or $1.50 on its own. The egg and ham sandwhich was delicious and at $3.99, what a deal!"}
{"text":"Been a while since I've come here. Just had dinner here, and unfortunately I have to take away a star for a couple of issues I had tonight.

Service was poor considering there were only 3 tables occupied including us the whole time we were there. Nobody came to take our order until a good 10-15 minutes after we got our menus. In addition, the waitresses came back a total of 4 times to confirm portions of our order, so you can tell they weren't very attentive to the few customers they had.

We shared a sirloin steak with garlic sauce and a seafood fried rice with shrimp sauce. The rice was good and definitely one I would recommend, however the sirloin steak was overcooked (we asked for medium well, we got well done). It was hard to cut it to pieces unless you force it cause of the rather blunt knife we had.

I still like this place as I know someone who works here, but their steak and service (and iced lemon tea from my previous review) need to be improved for me to give this place 4 stars again."}
{"text":"There are good times and bad times.  Sometimes the grilled   steak is great but sometimes it tastes like dead meat.  Takes pet clean in general but the laminate floor is curled up from chronic dampness. The best part is the tea with  condensed milk ??"}
{"text":"food is really good, there is one waitress in her 40's extremely rude i still come here cause the food is great, but all it takes sometimes a rude waitress to leave a bad taste in your mouth even after a great meal."}
{"text":"Great spot for afternoon tea! It can get pretty busy around lunch and seating is limited so heading over in the afternoon is what I prefer. I went around 4pm (afternoon tea is till 5:30pm) and I was able to be seated immediately for 2. All the afternoon tea menu items come with a hot or cold drink, although there might be an extra charge depending on the drink. 

The french toast is one of my favourites. It's two slices of thick white toast with smooth peanut butter smeared in between and fried to golden perfection.

Other items that are noteworthy include the baked pork chop on rice and the Portuguese chicken on rice.

Overall a pretty decent cafe with cheap prices."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch. It can get really busy because the price is pretty cheap. Food taste okay but am concern with the amount of flies. Don't mind sharing my food but not with the flies. Service can be slow. Waitress doesn't take proactive approach to take order. It is like every hk cafe, need improvement in hygiene."}
{"text":"If there were a six star I could give only once in my life, it would be this little Hongkong style place called sugar sweet cafe. This was located only one block from where my wife/love of life used to live. We squeezed together in a tiny room to save money on rent, and we couldn't really affrod any fancy restaurants. However, this little place with delicious and generous food at great price, brought us so much happiness. We usually went there after all day of work, and I would order my all time favorite which is the baked spaghetti with tomato sauce and fried pork chop, and she usually like to have Singapore style rice noodle. They also served us tasty milk tea as an appetizer and soup at end. We enjoyed every single moment there and we always laughed together, held hands and talked about dreams. It doesn't matter how much money I can make for her in future or how big of a house I could afford for her. She is the sweetest girl in my life, and looking at her smiling face made me realize what my real dream was. If I could spend the rest of my life, holding her hands and bring her to this little cozy cafe, that would make me the happiest man in my life. She is just this type of an angel that is happy for such little things, and never asks for more. 
Now four years have past, I have been more successful in my career with much more earnings. However, my love of life is no longer with me. I have made terrrible, terrible mistakes that broke her heart. I look at my bank account and those big numbers don't bring me any moment of happiness. I wish I could go back to the time with her when we only had 20 dollars in the pocket but we could enjoy a happy meal together. I know life has no regrets and there is no way back. People make mistakes and learn from the pain. I only wish the best for her now, and if miracle could come true, I would hold her hand so tightly and never let it go. 
Thank you, sugar sweet cafe, for serving us such delicious and generous meals with friendly price. And more importantly, for providing me this place of love and unforgettable memories!"}
{"text":"Nice family style restaurant, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner!  Affordable pricing and great service.  Now they accept debit!"}
{"text":"Came here with a business partner and lemme tell you... I loved it! Had a positive vibe, the food was surprisingly really good. I'm a picture menu type of person and no pictures were on the menu so I had to pick something that sounded good so I went for the Chicken Steak with Black Pepper Sauce and lemme tell you!!! Legit!! Loved it. Got a free soup, free dessert and my bill was only $11!!!!

I don't even know how they make money but damn will I be coming back? Yes whenever I'm in the Scarborough area"}
{"text":"Sugar Sweet Cafe

This Hong Kong Style's Cafe name in English and it's Chinese name \"Octopus\" might both be disappointing to some...

If you looking for Sugar Sweet's dessert? you definitely be disappointed..as the menu feature exclusively Hong Kong Style's restaurant selections ...

If you looking for specialized octopus cuisine... (live octopus? Takoyaki?) I don't see that on the menu either...

Wednesday's afternoon tea time in Scarborough... this place was packed, these people must know something I don't.. since this is the first time I come here!!

Waitress suggested not to order any wonton or dumpling noodles as it would take forever for the food arrive. forever is NOT 5 min.. is 15 minute.. so Skip that! Since one go to Cafe of this type is for fast food!!!

Preserved Vegetable Pork Vermicelli ($4.25) and Beef Briskets Rice Noodle ($4.50) with drinks were both A-OK. Portion size is big..Not too often when my yelp buddy would comment that \"Hey! This is a lot of Noodle!\" 

So come to Sugar Sweet Cafe if you want to have something affordable, decently tasty and fast!!"}
{"text":"Eh. Moderate pricing, moderate food. The HK style milk tea leans towards bitter (not smooth); we ordered a variety of breakfast meals and they were all relatively forgettable. Good for your average cafe joint if you just want a decent-ish meal."}
{"text":"First off. Who is the duke of this place.  I have 17 check ins and I'm still only 6th in check ins here. Someone must be living here and checking in everyday.  

Anyways. This is an update after coming here on the regular at least twice a week.  The food here has been consistently good and just great bang for your buck.  Cheap and delicious. Where else can you get a set dinner 3 course meal.  For about 11-12 bucks out the door?  Comes with a drink too.   A bonus is one time I forgot my iphone and they kept it for me.  When I went to pick it up they even verified I was the right person by telling me to call the phone before returning it.  Quite honest owner.  

Tip: sometimes you have to ask for dessert.  They seem to give it randomly."}
