{"text":"They don't take reservations so be sure to get there earlier than the dinner crowd. Luckily I went on a Sunday instead of a Friday or Saturday, so it wasn't as crazy. They also only take cash, i.e no credit or debit until further notice. 

For a party of four, we ordered the following: (1) Singapore Laksa, (2) Green Curry Chicken, (3) Garlic Okra, (4) Mixed Beef and Chicken Satay Skewers (5) two orders of Roti and (6) a bowl of steam rice! 

For dessert, we ordered (7) Teh Tarik and (8) Banana Fritters with Vanilla Ice-cream. 

(1) The Singapore Laksa noodles were soft, which is the way I prefer it. Their level is spicy is not too bad - you could probably survive without chugging down your water for this one! I enjoyed having the tofu, the fish slices, and other assorted foods in this one. I'd ordered this again, though if anyone has been to Gourmet Malaysia near Brimley and Sheppard in Scarborough, I'd recommend their Laksa over Restoran Malaysia's. 

(2) The Green Curry Chicken is a must-order whenever I visit. The green curry is spicy - so be sure to have some water ready. Still, I find it heart warming and absolutely love eating this with rice. The chicken itself is however a bit dry. If i had the option to order Green Curry with veggies, it would be my go to.

(3) The Garlic Okra was scrumptious and fun to eat. The slice it up so for those who have some difficulties eating okra uncut, Restoran Malaysia makes lives easier! There was a good amount of garlic so it added flavour. While i thought it could have been less salty, my other party members thought it was just right. This bowl of Garlic Okra was gone the fastest, and it makes a great neutral veggie dish among other spicy orders. I'd order this again. 

(4) Mixed Beef and Chicken Satay skewers came with three beef and three chicken, along with some sliced cucumbers and a peanut-sesame sauce. Although I'm not exactly sure of all the ingredients that went into the sauce, it gave off a sweet, sticky, and sesame taste that complemented the meats well. The meats were well seasoned and not over cooked. They were easy to eat, and easy to share. 

(5) Another order that was easy to share would be the roti. It was soft, and went well with dipping into the Green Curry and even the Laksa for me. While I enjoyed it being soft, a party guest of mine thought the roti could have been crispier. 

(6) And lastly, rice may be rice, but Restoran Malaysia gives a generous portion for one bowl. It tasted like it was freshly steamed rice without over drying, and also went well with the curry! 

(7) Their (hot) Teh Tarik was not overwhelmingly sweet and probably \"just right\". It was nice to balance out the salty and spicy flavours with something sweet. 

(8) The Banana Fritters with Ice-cream took longer than I expected but perhaps they were getting busy around 7:30 pm. The banana fritters were not too doughy, and maintained their warm temperature. It certainly went well with the vanilla ice-cream. 

Their service was wonderful. I didn't have any issues and the waiters/servers (we had more than one?) came by frequently to check up on us. 

I would certainly come again the next time I'm craving Singapore Laksas and Green curry, without wanting to drive all the way to Scarborough!"}
{"text":"This place was great! From the outside, I didnt reaiize how large and pretty it would be inside. I decided to check out this place after reading about it on blogto and was craving some yummy pad thai! I started with the spring rolls,but really didnt like them and found them tasteless. For my main,  I ordered the pad thai and it was a large serving, with lots of shrimp and chicken. It was great. The servers were very attentive, maybe a tad too much, but it was good! I also really liked the extensive mixed fruit drinks that they had! I tried a Cinderella drink, which was orange juice, lemon and pineapple juice.I can't wait to go back and try something dfifferent!"}
{"text":"I went there with my husband because we heard many good things about it. The wait was super long, 20-30 min. And the food was okay, but nothing special. 
The service was good in terms of the waitresses, but really I would not go there unless I have to."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. Been here many times, never had a bad experience. Note: cash only !!!"}
{"text":"I had been searching for a good Malaysian restaurant in the Toronto area when a friend recommended Restoran Malaysia to me.  It was a bit of a trek but she insisted that it would be well worth the trip.  I took her advice and was not disappointed.  The roti is awesome although the portion of curry served with it is amazingly tiny.  Some of my Malaysian friends have even said this is the best Malaysian food they've had outside of Malaysia.  The wait can be quite long, especially when you have a big party but the wait staff is friendly and attentive.  The prices are decent and the portions (outside of the roti curry) are pretty big!"}
{"text":"Not high quality. Not super fresh. But hits the spot. Definitely one of the best \"Asian\" restaurants in the area in terms of satisfying that craving you have on a Sunday evening. 

Most items are great but be wary of large portions so order wisely."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off commending the food.   It was my birthday so five of my friends and I went to this restaurant to celebrate. We ordered the beef curry with roti, the beef satay skewers,  the green mango salad,  the Chinese broccoli with chicken and ginger,  the Malaysian fried chicken,  the vegetarian eggplant, the Indonesian fried rice, and a fried noodle dish with chicken.

My biggest issue was that I found a hair on one of my rotis, and the server just brushed it off like it didn't matter.   He did not even apologize and merely offered to replace the roti. 

Although the food was good, there are plenty of restaurants that serve good food and provide great service. 

Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"A place that I have frequented for years. They have definitely changed in many ways from the menu to the prices, but it remains one of the places that I will default to. 

There are many quirks of the place that you should know. 

- They are not open on Sundays (which may no longer be true since the owner messaged me and asked me to change this) 
- they only accept cash, and the nearest bank is a RBC or HSBC - which is across the road 
- the tea is not free like most Asian restaurants
- they don't take reservations
- you must go early if you have a large group because there are only a few tables that can host groups larger than 6... 

Other than that, dishes I frequently order are any of the roti combos ( I especially enjoy the beef and lamb) or the pad see ew (beef flat noodles with a bit of kick in the spices) 

Waiters are normally on the ball, and service is okay. Sometimes you need to wait a little bit if they are busy, but you will barely realize that you are waiting if you are in good company! 

Dishes typically range in the $10-20 category, but are large enough to share if you order a few!"}
{"text":"Tried the curry chicken with roti. They charged extra for roti but it was a good roti. However the chicken has white pieces in it. I don't recommend it.
Tried black peppered beef kay teow. It was burnt no good. So they returned the food and said sorry."}
{"text":"Note: They started accepting cash only (for months now) - very inconvenient.

So far it's the best Malaysian food I've been able to find in the GTA.

A great spot for small/large groups. The wait can be long during the dinner hour, especially during the weekends. It's also a family spot for dinner, so embrace yourselves for annoying/untamed kids that scream and throw tantrums.

The service is pretty good and the servers are attentive for the most part.

Food:
Roti - Common item you'll find on everyone's table.

Malay Kari - Chicken (dark meat) - Ask for the dark meat over the white meat, you'll see the difference. The chicken curry is made with consistency and it's great to have with rice and the roti.

Indonesian Fried Rice - Can't go wrong with this, it tastes good all the time."}
{"text":"Oh man, people and their rants, seriously. The Malaysian food here is really good, i mean really good, especially their parathas and chicken curry, if you had to have one thing to eat here make it that. As for the thai stuff I've had better at places closer to my house, since i live around 50 KMs away so I go there every few months, and it's been going on for the last five years or so, the quality of the food has been maintained, the service is prompt, and all the Malaysian dishes I've had there have been amazing. For Chinese I'd rather go a bit south and try the Lin Garden."}
{"text":"This probably my favourite Malaysian restaurant! Its cash only, and theres a dece comic book store in the same plaza. 
Included pics of a few of my fav dishes."}
{"text":"please CONSIDER TAKING RESERVATIONS! Telling people its a 90 minute wait doesnt make your business look in demand. It looks like bad management and GREED! Food is good but not superb.. im thinking its busy only becuase of their Groupon special."}
{"text":"The food is good, but somebody should let the manager and owner know that their behaviour is bad and offensive to customers... I feel bad for waiters and waitresses as they seem to be very accommodating.. I do not believe I would be going back there any time soon..."}
{"text":"Best roti canai out there!

Normally I don't venture north of Bloor but given recent work circumstances, I find myself in Richmond Hill often... and today I had a craving for roti canai.  Normally, I would check out my favorite Malaysian dive in a plaza on Steeles, but was across the street from Restoran and thought I'd give it a try.

I didn't come for the atmosphere, but the dark furniture and modern bathroom makes this more fancy than expected...  as were the prices - average dish will cost between $11 to $18.  Service was quick... no complaints.

On to the food... the best roti canai I have had.  Absolutely delicious curry and the roti was the perfect texture... a MUST have while here.  I also ordered the chili chicken as well, which was bad...  very bad.  Four stars because of the horrid chili chicken, but otherwise five stars!"}
{"text":"Unless you can cook chicken rice at home, this by far is the best place in Toronto area to get hainanese chicken rice (otherwise known as Singapore chicken rice). They serve two kinds : steamed white chicken or roasted chicken.  They still can't compare with real singaporean chicken rice, but for a restaurant, they're pretty good.

IMO, the roasted chicken was better, but the steamed I'd not bad.

The fried kway teow (fried flat rice noodle with) was also excellent.

Other dishes were average, the pad thai was passable, but there are better places, and the mee Siam was terrible.  The curries beef, chicken were bad, and the rendang beef (a dried curry) was awfu
 As well.

Lunch menu was much better value than dinner, as is normal with places like this.

Friday nights, the place will be packed and your wait for  table will be two hours unless people in front of you leave and never come back (it's across the street to walmart, so they usually do). 

I would have rated this a 1 star if not for the chicken rice and fried kweteow. The chicken rice themselves were 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went there to celebrate one of my friend's birthday. Food was excellent! My favorite was Red Curry, Indonesian Fried Rice, but everything we order was delicious. The service was just as good! We brought a birthday cake, which they kept inside their kitchen and when the meal was done, the waiters/waitresses brought the cake and sang happy birthday! My friend was completely surprised! It was very nice of the them to do this for us. We had a great time and appreciate the waiters/waitresses that work there!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried such authentic Malaysian food for a long time except in Malaysia. Char Kuay Teow is a must try item!!!! Malay tea is a bit expensive ($4) but thanks god I still wanna try. It tastes sooooo good! I've ordered 2 finally!!!"}
{"text":"Good service.  Ok food.  Pas Sew was yummy but greasy.  Lots of people for lunch.   The curry was yummy but not too much meat served for lunch.  Th"}
{"text":"What can i say...i have been following this restaurant since they opened up in Scarborough on Markham Road, then to Market Village, and now this location..
so I am a FAN! 

Why? 3 big reasons.
1.Great food
2. Great service
3. One of the best (if not the best) Malaysian food in TO with decent prices...and Clean...

Some of my favourites dishes are: 
1. Singapore rice
2. Roti and curry lamb
3. Deep fried chicken (yes scrumptious and fulfilling)
4. the Malaysian tea (the one that they poured from 4 feet up and down to the cup)

we just went there a week ago with a toddler... and they were accommodating... they gave us a good table and special noodles for him... especially he may object to spicy food at his young age. 

the six of us ordered many dishes and they were delivered promptly with great taste.
i also appreciated the fact that they always asked whether we have food allergy...

So, this is my FAVE place... and oh... they are a cash only establishment... so bring your money... (It is worth every penny!)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants, if I take someone special out who appreciates excellent food, I take them here. A nice cozy ambiance and beautiful decor with exceptional service. Also the food is halal

This place is not for everyone it is cash only and I do not think they have alcoholic beverages, but considering how great the food and the reasonable prices, that is a small sacrifice to pay.

Food is well flavoured, using fresh ingredients, and everything is cooked to perfection. Shrimp, vegetables, beef, fried banana are all cooked to perfection. 

Definitely will back!"}
{"text":"Sorry, this review is way over due! This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto hands down (although you really need a car to get here).  We've been here many times and the food and service is consistently fantastic! 
Must try dishes: Roti with curry sauce, Nasi goreng, Nyonya chicken curry or Beef Rendang, Mango-Lychee Freeze and fried bananas with ice cream !"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY!!! (for now at least) 


I went to this restaurant today for dinner with my family. Right off the bat, I realized I should've made reservations. I went on a Sunday night and it was so BUSY!!! The hostess told us it would take 40 minutes and it did. It was clear that this place was pretty damn good. We were seated and our order was taken quickly. To start off we ordered two drinks: guava banana and fruit fantasy. The guava banana was DELICIOUS!!! It was perfectly sweet but not too sweet. Like I said, it was perfect. The fruit fantasy had a strong pineapple and honeydew flavor so it was less sweet but delicious. They were $5 each. It was so so good. Highly recommend it and it was a good portion. We were 4 and 2 drinks were enough.

For food we ordered Indonesian fried rice, pad Thai (chicken only), grilled calamari, and mixed chicken and beef satay. 

The appetizer chicken and beef satay was so delicious. It was juicy, warm, and so tender. Definitely worth it. $10

The grilled calamari was just as great. Good portion and very delicious seasoning. $10

The Indonesian fried rice which was shrimp fried rice with veggies and shrimp chips and a fried egg was delicious! Huge portion, enough for like 4 people to split. 

The pad Thai which we ordered with chicken bc my moms allergic to shrimp was great. They accommodate to allergies like shrimp or peanut allergies which is convenient.

The service was amazing! The waiters and waitresses work really hard and so ofc we had to tip! We only tipped $15 but I wish I gave more!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Malaysia Restaurant several times and it's a pretty decent place. 
I had ordered Pad Thai in the past and it's not my fave because the sauce is sweet. Now if you are into that , you will probably like it. 
This last time I went to Malaysia was yesterday with 5 other friends. Naturally as a big group we ordered lotsa food , plus we were starving. ( Having Luch at 3, lol) 
For appetizers I got Tom Yum soup which was okay, nothing special. We ordered 2 veggi dishes for appetizers Eggplant and Green Beans. They were both delish and no crumbs were left. We also had spring rolls, which I don't recommend. It lacked flavour and were very oily. 
For mains we all had different dishes. I had veggi curry from their lunch menu. It was alright. Also lacked flavour unfortunately. My friend had a delish dish also from the Luch menu, I forget the name but it had soy sauce and chilli pepper as dressing and it was flat noodles with veggies and tiny shrimp:)  Thankfully I have generous friends so Aysel shared her food with me. The portions are pretty large, so we didn't have to fight over it. 

Service was great and fast:) 
  
I'll be back for the dishes I liked :)"}
{"text":"The good:
- Mellow atmosphere
- Decent food, I liked the satay and durian smoothie.

Not so good stuff:
- Service was poor, really poor. Had to wait for at least 30 min before we were even acknowledged by the staff. There were only 3 tables full, so it wasn't busy either.

- Pricey for the the size and quality of food. Not anything like local Malaysian fare. 

- As far I know they don't take cards? Cash Only which is a bummer."}
{"text":"Long ago, before they renovated years ago, I used to frequent this restaurant because of their amazing roti and curry. I recently went back with a pad thai craving and found the food still delicious. As a group, we ordered the pad thai, pineapple fried rice, and roti with chicken curry (with extra roti). It was all delicious and flavourful but though I had thought that the portions appeared generous at the start of the meal, my whole table and I still felt hungry after finishing and ordered another dish to share. Since most of the dishes ranged between $8-13, even in the lunch menu, the portions were maybe a little disappointing. Maybe they could create lunch combo menus? Plus, I found the fried rice lacking in colour (well, it was really just all one colour: orange).
The space is nicely done in dark wood with plenty of Asian motifs like Buddha and red accents but also a LOT of large amethyst geodes sitting by the door (I guess the owner's superstitious or something). There are two sections of the restaurant. One side was already filled up with people for lunch when we arrived so we were seated in the quieter and brighter section, which itself was halfway filled by the end of our meal. Obviously, Restoran is a popular spot for everyone. I saw young couples, business men, and small families dining there. The waitress for our table was average but her supervisor (at least that's what I think he was) was very eager and polite.

Short version:
Food: 4/5
Decor/Atmosphere: 4/5
Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"So far the best thai food I've had in Toronto! The service was amazing (thank you Joyce for seating us so quickly), the time it took to get our food was quick AND the food tasted amazing. We had the pad thai which was A LOT but oh so good! We also had the red curry and sweet and sour pineapple shrimp...which was amazing as well but did not have a lot of sauce to it. Not to mention, our bill was surprisingly low for all that we had. So I left the place with a full belly, leftover pad thai, and big smile on my face :-)"}
{"text":"The food was decent, a little heavy and on the oily side. The lady owner gets very emotional and angry at customers very easily. I also saw her yelling at her staff behind the bar. Not sure how such an atmosphere could be inviting to new customer :S"}
{"text":"Two stars because we can't give half stars, otherwise, they'd get 1 1/2 stars from me. Let's just say that a health inspector must visit this place, pronto. No joke. I was using  the washroom right before my meal when I overheard explosive diarrhea sounds coming from the stall next to mine. I quickly did my business and left the washroom ASAP! I was so worried and sad for the person using that stall but further more, I was beginning to worry about the food. Ha. Sadly, I had every reason to, not only was their pork spring rolls sour (literally smelt like rotten meat), their green curry was sour. Must've been a bad day for them because the food was just terrible. Unless you want to risk having explosive diarrhea, I would say, pass on this restaurant. Yes, it was that bad."}
{"text":"Will the real Malaysian please stand up!

My party of five (NOTE: 2 Singaporeans and 3 Malaysians) walked into the restaurant  with high spirits and excitement. Afterall, we did drive 12 hours from Chicago to Richmond Hill for a couple of nights and decided to allocate one precious meal to enjoy an authentic Malaysian luncheon. 

My one star rating summarizes our experience. utter disappointment.

Food: we ordered Indian Mee Goreng, Roti Canai with Curry Chicken, Char Kuay Teow and Mee Siam.  Not one dish was impressive.  Roti Canai was not crispy, chicken curry was watery, the kuay teow was the thick kind, not the thin ones we have in Penang, Mee Siam was blend and the Mee Goreng just over cooked.

To my 3 Malaysian friends, national pride was at stake here. Afterall, Malaysian food is supposed to be better than Singaporean food! We had to give the owners some feedback, afterall, they were Malaysian too.

Service: If I could give negative stars, I would.  The service was non existant.  Our server looked like she was being forced to serve us. The owner came over after 10 minutes of our request and did nothing but offer one word of apology.  

The experience at Restoran Malaysia was totally unpleasant and we will never return.  And neither should any of you yelpers. We know authentic Malaysian food, and this is definately NOT it.   

This is what you call a \"waste of stomach space\"."}
{"text":"Everything was great!!

- Malaysian Cooler was off the hook!!
- Food was delicious
- Seating was plentiful
- Server was very nice

Overall, one of the best restaurants I have been and wished we had something like this in the DC area, but I am looking forward to next time :)"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant in Richmond Hill. 
The outside decor would fool you to think otherwise, but it's a little gem! The menu has a fairly large selection, the food is great and for a very decent price."}
{"text":"The assorted platter is a must order if you have a large group. You get a bit of every thing. The satay is juicy and crab cake is not oily."}
{"text":"Wow! I love this place. The food is fantastic, the prices are great. Try the durian smoothie as a dessert, you won't be sorry! (Unless you hate durian)"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is one of my favorites in Richmond hill. My favorite dish is the Penang fried kuay teow, which is a fried broad noodle (the broadest noodle I've ever seen!) with shrimp, egg, bean sprouts, and chili sauce. It has just a bit of kick and tons of flavor. Other dishes are good too, but IMO they do noodles and rice the best. The roti is pretty good too, although I find their curry dipping sauce too watery. My fave drink there is the mango lychee freeze. Drink slowly. Big brain freeze potential. Their Teh Terik (pulled tea available hot or cold) reminds me of HK style milk tea (nai-cha). I find the Teh Terik even richer in flavor, and goes perfect with my fried kuay teow."}
{"text":"This is one of the most authentic Malaysian cuisines in the Greater Toronto Area. Definitely suggest to order the chicken curry which is rich in flavours and having brought some of my Malaysian and Singaporean friends and they have deemed it authentic with their stamp of approval. Order the chicken curry with roti prata and roti prata with egg which is a South-Indian pancake that is crisp on the outside. Additionally, the Hainanese Chicken Rice and the Chicken satay are always good bets too!"}
{"text":"Love the food here and this place is always packed. Came here for dinner with 2 other friends, we came here around 6pm and was able to get a seat immediately. 

We ordered a number of dishes to split including Tom Yum Goong soup (~$5/ bowl), Roti (2) and Curry Mutton/ chicken (~$9 each), pad thai (~$10), satay chicken and satay beef (~$13 each). I highly recommend trying out all these dishes, but bare in mind if you can't each spicy food, I would pass on the Tom Yum Goong soup as it is very spicy. Food arrived fairly quickly and great service. We had about 1/2 plate of pad thai to go and the bill came up to just under $100 with tax and tip.

Remember to bring cash as they don't take debit or credit."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  But truly disappointed.  Completely dissatisfied.  Was here traveling from States. Restaurant refuses to take credit cards, or debit cards.  Paid in U.S. Dollars. Restaurant cashier refused to convert bill into U.S. Dollars. Was charged extra 50 U.S. Dollars. Wanted the exact amount refused and denied converting Canadian dollars amount to US amount.  Plus charged extra 15% surcharge for service because we had over 10 people.  Was never informed about this charge prior to meal being served. Completely poor customer service.  The restaurant new that we were being overcharged by making us pay in United States dollars.  They felt no shame in robbing a customer. In fact insulted customer, saying you should be grateful that we are taking US dollars.  So if you want to to be insulted and taking advantage of (robbed) then choose this place!  Food was good but experience of being cheated out money truly disappointing.  We like to support local business... But not if the business cheats you and insults you."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great and very authentic. A little pricey.  The only downside is that it only accepts cash. What restaurant only accept cash unless they like to not fully declare for tax purposes. Would have given a 4-5 stars but have to go with 3 since it's a bit pricey and does not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was great.  It can be difficult to find parking on weekends due to the sheer size of the lot but other than that everything is perfect."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Having heard so much about this restaurant I was really looking forward to the mean. Great Gado gado to start and downhill after that Two soups were  horrible..Most of the appetizer plate was inedible. Dry tasteless chicken satay, weird taste to the beef satay. Spring rolls with a thick heavy wrap and unpleasant tasting fillings. Fish cakes had a pasty texture and little taste. We left most of the food uneaten. My companion is Dutch and was dreaming of the Malaysian food we eat in Holland. We certainly know wonderful this food should be"}
{"text":"This place is a real gem in the 905. I've been coming here since before they renovated and doubled in size and the quality of their food hasn't missed a beat.

There aren't many other Malaysian restaurants in Toronto to compare this to, but I recently went to a Malaysian Kitchen event in NYC that showcased all of the various Malaysian restaurants in NYC and Restoran Malaysia's food was way better!

If you didn't know, the owners are really Malaysian and they import a lot of their ingredients from Malaysia, including their tasty shrimp chips! To experience real Malaysian cuisine, stick with dishes like their rendang beef and tumeric chicken, which are my personal faves.

They have some other Thai influenced dishes on their menu that are decent too, but it's the Malaysian dishes that taste the best."}

{"text":"Great place! The roti canai with curry is delicious. I'd recommend the Ayam Goring Kampung, the Angel Fire Chicken (if you can handle the spice) and Pineapple Fried Rice. Also the Teh Tarik (tea) was delicious. Service is average - depends on the server you get."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the meal.  I use to frequent this restaurant quite often but haven't been here in a few years.  Quality has definitely gone downhill.  The appetizer platter with satay, spring rolls, etc was the best part of the meal.  Deep fried fish was tender but lacking taste.  Everything else was so so.  The curries are flavourful but very watery.  Beef was dry.  Noodles were super sweet with not much chicken or other ingredients.  Deep fried banana with ice cream was good, but too late to alter my impression of overall meal.  Other Malaysian restaurants have better offerings."}
{"text":"visit 15+ (lunch & dinner)

From a little 1 unit hole in the wall to buying out the unit beside them, tearing it down and BAM you have a great and still busy all the time restaurant. There's so many nice things to say about this place, but I'll will keep it simple. Coz I know you guys want to get out there and dig in =P

First thing is please forgive the limited parking in their lot. It's well worth the wait. The customer is service is decent enough, if you get the right server. A few servers in there have the lack of knowledge of the food. I think it's because they don't speak english well.

They offer a wide variety of food on the menu, from curry, roti, fried rice, noodles and soups. Not a fan of \"too\" spicy, they offer non spicy items aswell.

Personal recommendations:

1. Beef Curry Roti
2. Chicken Curry Roti
3. Ayam Goring Kampung (fried piece of chicken with spice, topped with shrimp chips) 
4. Pineapple Fried Rice
5. Tom Yam Goong (clogged sinus? this soup will cure you)

Last but not least #6, order extra helpings of Nan to sop up the left over curry. Mmmm

Almost forgot. Your'e going to need something refreshing to accompany all those spicy. Have a Mango Milkshake!"}
{"text":"I have been to Restoran Malaysia twice. I loved their roti with curry, the fried chicken with shrimp paste, the sambal seafood was really good but very spicy though.

Their fried rice was a good portion, but nothing special.

And you gotta finish off the meal with a cup of their hot pulled tea. Their other desserts were good too. Tried the tapioca and the mango with coconut rice. Both were good.

Overall, I would given it a higher rating if prices were a bit more reasonable. We ended up paying $90 for three person (had a bit of leftover). Look to spend at least $25 - $30/per person for an average sized meal."}

Very nice service. 
Had thai fried rice. ... so so
Malay cold coffee. .., not really tasty ."}
{"text":"Their house hot sauce is phenomenal. I always get the Penang Char Kuay Teow, just recently tried the Singapore rice which was decent at best, the green curry is amazing as well as the Hot and Spicy Sambal."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant based on the reviews here. The food was okay. Not bad but not memorable either. The roti were really thin, greasy and overpriced, so I wouldn't recommend them. The main were mediocre."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered from this place recently.   We ordered take out.   Folks really have no clue wrt people with GF and DF restrictions.   Had to ask a number of times and explain what GF and DF was.   We finally did order take out.  When we brought the food home it really smelled  as I'm not sure if this has something to do with the packaging.      In terms of the service when I picked up the food, they seemed genuinely uninterested in serving me.   I'd think twice about coming back to this place."}

{"text":"I don't write review, but we were not welcome to this restaurant.....

We are a family of 5 with two young children and we purchased a Groupon for a 4 person dinner at this restaurant (paid $40 for $80 value of food).  When the waitress saw our Group on, she told us that we are not allowed to use it because we have 5 people.  She told us unwelcomely to return another time with only 4 people .  To try to make everything work out, we even offered to order one more dish for our 5 year old child, but this offer was rejected.  

We spoke to the Owner and the Manager and explained that there is no clear restriction that only 4 people are allowed at the table in order to use the Group on.  They were concerned that 10 people would show up after buying a 4-person Group on, but we were a family of 5 (with 2 children).  The Manager offered 15% off our meal but we could not use the Group on until we returned with only 4 people - so I have to leave my one child or one family member at home next time?!   

It was a terrible experience and I don't understand why they could not be flexible given that the 4th and 5th people in our party of 5 were children, and I couldn't even pay extra for the 5th person.  We were extremely disappointed with the service and the lack of consideration for our circumstances.  I have experienced first-hand the poor service at this restaurant and can fully support all the other negative comments about the service at this restaurant that have been posted.  

I am actually glad that we didn't dine in at this restaurant and will seek a refund for my Group on tomorrow."}
{"text":"I would considered those food was ok and it is good for those Malaysian who are in Toronto but a bit pricey. Gulai fish (curry fish) I had before wasn't same as what I always have in Malaysia. The curry didn't enough for eating with rice and my friends asked is it mayonnaise or curry. Beside, Balacan Kangkong (water spinach) wasn't taste good, lack shrimp paste (balancan) and dry shrimp. 

However, Tomyam soup, Nasi Lemak, Laksa and Fried Koay Teow were good. I recommended you should try either Kopi Tarik or Teh Tarik, It is similar as Malaysia. 

In addition, waitress or waiter did not understand what is the different in betweem kopi tarik and teh tarik. When I ordered kopi tarik and the waiter told me it is teh tarik. that is the big different in between kopi (coffee) and teh (tea). I suggestion the owner should give them a briefing before they serving their customer. Might be it is not annoying anyone of you but me."}
{"text":"Love this place, they have the best (and most authentic) laksa and char kway tiew in the GTA! I haven't found another place that has better laksa."}
{"text":"It's because of the lack of Malay food in this area that this place is popular. Their food is average. And because they're the only ones around, they over price everything since people don't know better."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of about 10 people for dinner. The service was fine and waitress was very helpful in suggesting items from the menu. However, I think the items were a little overpriced. I just remember splitting the bill with everyone and it came up to about $20 per person and I had barely ate anything.

The 1 star rating is because I got food poisoning from eating here. I woke up that night with very painful stomach cramps. In the morning, I had diarreah. During work, I was so ill. I could not eat anything, went to the washroom about four to five times with diarreah and very painful stomach aches. I also had the chills and my face was pale. I was pretty sure this episode was food poisoning as the next day I had bounced back to almost being normal. I asked a few of my friends who had eaten with me that night and a few of them had stomach pains during the night as well but nothing as bad as I had experienced"}
{"text":"BEWARE OF THIEVES AMONG THIS RESTAURANT'S SERVERS ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY TAKE CASH ONLY!

We are regulars at this Restaurant and ALWAYS had a positive experience untilt the last time we were there. We were there to celebrate my convocation. The food was great and service was fast. However, when we paid our bill, my husband put down $80 (4 twenty dollar bills) which was witnessed by my mother and myself. The waiter picked up the cash along with the bill only to come back and claimed that we put down $60. He was reluctant to even look for the missing $20 and we suggested to speak with the manager, which he was also reluctant to contact. We finally got hold of the manger ourselves and told her what happened. He then comes back and yells out loud \"it's OK, I paid for you, so you don't have to pay.\" 

Just to be clear, our aim is not to tarnish the image of this establishment. Though, this single individual's actions and remarks will make it highly unlikely for us to go back to what was previously a great establishment. We also find it bizarre that they stopped taking debit and rely only on cash payments in the 21st century.

Please be aware of a relatively short, small framed Asian man in his 40s or 50s with glasses. If you're paying, be sure to count the money with him and have another member of the staff witness it as well."}
{"text":"Really good, the food was very tasty and the service is great. I had the coconut rice and it was amazing, very fragrant and light. The food is inexpensive and good quality. 

Their menu is also extensive and they have several options to choose from. I also tried one of their smoothies, and was very impressed. 

I have been there a couple times and definitely recommend going there again."}
{"text":"If you like spicy, this is the place to be.
Order their angel beef or something along those lines and you will not be disappointed. Similar to the restaurant food I had in Kuala Lumpur but different from the street food which i'll take to be \"authentic\" but its a great restaurant none the less. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food: definite 5 stars
Service: very hit or miss, depends on their mood really! 
Highly recommend the Nasi Goreng fried rice, tom yum soup, Malay fried chicken and prawn sambar(super spicy!)"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner after a night out for bowling.  This was my second visit to this restaurant.  The last time I was here, I remember the food was pretty good.  So anyways, we ordered the TYG soup, seafood fried rice, green curry chicken, yellow curry beef, and another dish of fried rice.

The service was good, the waiters and waitress were quick to take down our orders and our cups were always filled.  However, I was kinda disappointed with the TYG soup; it tasted exactly like the msg you'd get with instant noodles.  The two dish of fried rice were soggy and flavourless.  All the curry weren't as thick as I like them to be.

Like I said, my first visit here was actually pretty good so maybe it was a bad night for the cooks?

Cheers."}
{"text":"I've came here once or twice and ordered the same thing every time. Me and my family usually come on Saturdays, and we go there after we finish shopping, wherever we go. To be honest, it's not my favourite place, but I would come here if I needed a quick bite before I went to my fencing class. It's okay overall, but I would suggest improving on the food serving times."}
{"text":"This is a familys favourite restaurant when we lived in Markham.  Today I travelled back to Richmondhill just for their mee mak me goring noodles.  The prices are so reasonable, large portions and just full of yummy flavours.  If you enjoy spicy foods there are plenty of options.  I just love the sambal fish, belechan orka or eggplant.  The can accommodate large groups.  I just dont like the fact you cant make reservations and they take only cash.  Sometimes the line ups can be long but the food is worth it.  Try their roti and teh tarik! I will always travel back no matter where I live"}
{"text":"What a HORRIBLE experience! We come here every few months, but this will be our last time. 

We had lunch here with a party looking for a relaxing Sunday afternoon.  The waitress took our lunch orders correcting us on the name on most items we can't pronounce. We are not malaysian so I really didn't expect them to be like this to us to start. When the food came, they gave us all the meals from the dinner menu (which was larger). When we asked, they said we didn't tell them we were having lunch so they gave us the same items from the regular menu. We came at lunch time...what made you think we want dinner portions?

Then later when the babies at our party needed to eat their own meal, the rude waitress came over and just asked us to name every ingredient in the baby food. She came off really rude, but we told her it was just veggies and milk. She then explained we cannot bring food into the building because of religious reasons. While I now understand the situation, boy could she use some manners and let us know kindly.


0 stars out of 5, if I can."}
{"text":"the food and restaurant are awesome...its 2017 and you refuse to take debit/credit??? tax evasion or worse.

i smell something very fishy indeed."}
{"text":"YAY!!!!  SO GOOD!!! Drove all the way from frickin Mississauga to try this place out so I was crossing my fingers hoping it would be worth the drive.  

BEEF SATAY-juicy, tender but a bit pricey.  Knock off one star for price.

CRAB NONYA-large and in charge!  Again, pricey but delicious and enough for a take out container for tomorrow night.  

CHICKEN ROTI CANAI-light and not greasy, highly addictive.  But $8.50 for 2 pieces of roti and a small bowl of curry with 3 pieces of chicken....pricey.  

INDONESIAN FRIED RICE-very tasty with shrimps and some fish flavouring.  

To go for my sister:  
SAMBAL BEEF-she tells me it was \"SOOOOOOOOO good.\"  Finished it quickly with some roti and the leftover fried rice.  

So can't wait to go back!  Next time laksas and more roti."}
{"text":"At first glance this restaurant does not even register on your radar, and I was really skeptical when I saw it from the outside...but I was pleasantly surprised! I am by no means going to pretend I am a connoisseur of Malaysian fare, but the food is delicious. 

I literally dream of their Basil Eggplant with coconut rice...dream of it! 

The prices are reasonable, the portions are generous and the staff is very attentive. It truly is a hidden gem in Richmond Hill..."}
{"text":"I'm a fan, I'm definitely a fan!

I was a little skeptical at first when I saw the sign... it just seemed like another ghetto restaurant, but as soon as I stepped inside, I was looking forward to something good.The décor is nice, nothing fancy or anything but definitely not ghetto, nor plain. The service was great, although the quality of the service will differ with every waitress. We were lucky enough to be served by one that was very knowledgeable and someone whom we could actually communicate with.

Now for the most important part of this particular review, THE FOOD. Most of us have had Thai and Indian before and things like green and yellow curry were nothing new to us. For the majority of our group however, this was generally an unfamiliar territory, so they were a little hesitant at the beginning. For a group of 6 we shared 6 dishes, and 6 rotis. Every single one of us left the restaurant full and very happy with the experience. We'll be coming back here for sure.

1) Green curry: The spiciness really sneaks up on you, but it's dang good! Word of advice: avoid if you can't handle spicy, but if you LIKE spicy, then Green curry is generally the spiciest.

2)  Fried Rice (I honestly forget which one we got but it was tasty) Word of advice: get a rice dish if you're going to have green curry, it works much better than water when it comes to spice relief.

3) Fried fish (I can't remember which one we got but I'll update when I find out), it was swimming in delicious curry and loads of veggies. Definitely a crowd favorite that afternoon.

4) Red curry with beef : it was kind of like a stew, the meat was really tender and the curry wasn't that spicy, mmmm~

5) Roti: very thin, but nice and chewy, sooo delicious!!

6) Last but not least, Ayam Goring Kampung (Crisp fried chicken with ground turmeric, topped with shrimp chips ) was my favorite dish. I'm a major fan of fried chicken and this was extra crispy with just enough saltiness. The shrimp chips were yummy too, dip both in one of the curry sauces and you will just sit there flabbergasted :)

When the bill came around we were all expecting to have to dish out at least $20 each including tax and tip (we're poor students) but we were pleased with paying $15/per person for such a great meal. That extra $5 can pay for a lot of photocopies/morning joes at school!! Lastly, apparently this place is usually super busy, but we were seated immediately on Sunday at around 4:30-5PM. By the time we were leaving, the place was crowded so go early if you don't want to wait!"}
{"text":"Whenever I think of laksa, I think of this place. Yes, it is this good. I have been a patron of this place for a few years and it has never disappointed me.

Don't judge by the exterior, the interior is actually very nice (it has gone through renovation a couple of years ago. You can imagine how I felt during their renovation.. living without a proper Malaysian meal for a few months...) 

Anyway, as far as food goes, this place rocks. It easily offers THE BEST Malaysian food in town. Their Singapore Laksa is to die for. Their pad thai is good, not too sweet. Be sure to save some room for desserts, their brown (purple) sticky rice is wonderful."}
{"text":"Best \"Singapore Chicken\" in town.  Also, their curry with roti is great.  Price is a bit steep though."}
{"text":"Was a little hesitant dining here based on some bad reviews regarding the service, but reviews of the food were generally good so we gave it a try. Boy, am I glad we did! The food was excellent, the service fantastic. We ordered the appetizer plate and nasi goreng, definitely enough food to feed two people. They missed one star because the rice was a bit dry, but otherwise the flavours were amazing. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great delicious food....especially Tom yum soup....terribly rude service ! We had hard time reaching them by phone and when we finally did ...we we ordered the food to be ready by 9:30 pm...restaurant was open till 10 pm...they prepared our soup for when we arrived and said we could still dine in with the soup as long as we arrive by 930....we arrived around 9:33 and were just a few minutes late...they refused to serve us and insisted we take the soup to go...we told them we preferred to eat the soup in the restaurant while still fresh (it was winter and cold out )....the owner there got mad and rude and snatched the food out ....meanwhile the other lady was also rude with us...terrible customer service ...we ended up going to a thai restaurant across the street called basil thai ....they also close at 10pm and at that point we were even more late while wasting time at this Malaysian place ....but at the thai place ...they were still very happy to serve us and very welcoming ...we ordered same Tom yum soup and spring rolls at basil thai ...I gotta say....hands down much better than this Malaysian restaurant ....pure delicious ....spring rolls amazing ...I would not recommend this Malaysian restaurant to anyone ! Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"I gave them four stars because you can't find anything near them in Richmond Hill.  
We went during weekday for lunch; so the place wasn't busy.  
Their roti is small but pretty good, very fresh and soft; we ordered roti with chicken curry and beef curry; both of them are good.  
Pad Thai is good; I like it because they are not too sweet; some places made their pad thai so sweet :S  
Singapore chicken rice is average; the boneless chicken is soft and tender but nothing special about it and the sauce is spicy.  
appetizer: the size of the skewers are small, so little meat but their satay sauce was so good. 
We also tried their desserts (I forgot their names whatever with rice and/or sticky rice), they are so SWEET!!! My mom wanted to pour some hot water to dilute them!
We will go back for their roti :)
It is a baby-friendly restaurant; they have CHANGE table in their washroom!!! HOORAY!!!"}
{"text":"I would opt for take out rather than eat-in at this restaurant. The food is good however the atmosphere is not very appetizing. I love their Rotti and Yellow Curry. The food is consistently good, however the service in the restaurant is not the greatest."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place since 2010, if anything drastic has changed about it I'm probalby behind on that.

Lunch menu here is well priced, I find that it is probably the most popular section of their menu which is a shame because it also has the most mainstream foods available. 

Dinner Menu: I've had their nasi lemak and their other Malay foods and I found them to be good for canadian standards (I have an indonesian background). Their prices are quite high for dinner but considering their cuisine it is nothing out of the ordinary (unfortunately). 

Overall, I find that this place is a good stop for those who want to tryout malay food. However if you are looking to expand your malaysian food repertoire you'll have to suck it up and either suffer with canadian style malay food or wait till the malay food niche hits the level of popularity as thai and viet cuisine."}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times when I am not that kind of person that sticks to one place. But the food is amazing,  well served, flavours in balance and acceptable prices."}
{"text":"I agree with most of recent NEGATIVE reviews.

In my view there are five reasons why a successful restaurant goes south.

1.    Greed
2.    Dishonesty
3.    Arrogance
4.    Food Quality
5.    Service

Seems RESTORAN MALAYSIA has either accomplish most of it or on the way to achieve them.

GREED: Shows in their recently introduction of CASH ONLY, so they can pocket more money from Canada Revenue Agency and Government of Ontario and by creating uncomfortable situation for their customers.

DISHONESTY: On the road to introduce CASH ONLY policy they started out by giving the illusion to their customers that there is a technical problem, hence thinking that their customers are STUPID. But everyone got it now what the real reason is.

ARROGANCE: The success of the restaurant has gone over owners head, Servers have become more rude and I am sure they picked it up from the owners. Last week I went with my family of seven (7) people. North side of the restaurant was completely empty. Even south side was about 30% filled. I asked for a round table because it makes it easier with three young kids. On the South side, the ONLY round table was occupied but north side was available. They refuse to give me that. When I insisted and showed them the empty round table they said that side is closed. I talked to the Owner Lady, I reminded her that we are frequent customers but she was even more rude than the server. Her answer was that one smaller round table is only for five people and the bigger one is for nine people. I said that we are seven and will fit nicely. Her answer was flat \"NO\", if you don't want sit on what we are giving you then \"GO\". Of course I left and not coming back.

FOOD QUALITY: Even though I have not experienced it but other review definitely show that they are on that road and will definitely achieve that with the help of all above reasons.

SERVICE: My experience above and in light of other reviews they are on that road too and am confident that they will achieve that in near future.

What a shame to see a good, successful establishment adopting a route of self destruction. I still wish them GOOD LUCK and hope they will change their short comings before it is too late."}
{"text":"Last time I came here was about 7-8 years ago and now I remember why I haven't been back in so long. Nothing is spectacular about this place so I don't know why this place has such good reviews. It can't be the food and it definitely can't be the value. I'll explain later. 

As previously mentioned by others, the curry here is not going to be on par with sukothai or khao San road, so don't go in there with that expectation. Also, when you consider the price of Restoran's curries compared to the aforementioned places, you'll realize how over priced it is. $13-18 for curry but Restoran is not giving you starch with your meal btw. For $2 you get one tiny piece of roti or a small bowl of rice, neither enough to enjoy thoroughly with the curry. I ordered the hot and spicy sambal with beef and my wife ordered yellow curry. My curry was described as onions, spices, tomatoes and tamarind. It was just one note: spicy. No sourness came through with the tamarind to balance out the spiciness, which made it kind of unpleasant to eat. The yellow curry was nice with the coconut flavour but was very greasy. 

We also ordered satay, which you get 6 skewers for $13. The portion of the meat cubes were tiny. 

There's nothing Malaysian about this place from what I can see. I'm not a Malaysian food expert but I can see the place is run by all Chinese people. The food reflects this as well. Seeing how others have mentioned they've \"temporary\" stopped taking visa/debit 2+ months ago shows me they have no intentions to bring back other payment options outside of cash. I don't mind paying cash but they could at least provide a bit more value with the food, i.e. Serve rice with the meal. Everyone knows you're only accepting cash because you're scamming the government tax so at least pass some of that money back to your customers. Charging extra for starch with curry is like charging extra for a bun on a hamburger."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with friends and ordered the vegetarian green curry with the rice, heavenly taste so divine. The portions are also generous, they used a variety of vegetables like large baby corn and eggplant, green peppers etc. I love the spices they use in their dishes. The place is also well decorated  and inviting and very comfortable."}
{"text":"Restoran Malaysia is one of the two go-to places for Malaysian (incl. Singaporean, Indonesian and Thai) in Toronto (well, Richmond Hill). I've been to both here and Gourmet Malaysia a little to the south, and Restoran Malaysia is almost as good. Maybe has slightly less flavour.

Penang Assam Laksa, Belcan Kang Kong, Roti, Beef Rendang, Nonya Melaka Curry, all excellent. Singapore Laksa, Penang Rojak, Masak Debal were pretty good, though not as good as the others. Selection of interesting drinks. Everything is very authentic (though sometimes I wish  it was spicier). The restaurant is very successful and always packed. Service is top notch, not just professional, but they often go the extra mile (once a waiter heard I was interested in something and had it cooked up and gave it to us with our leftovers, even though it wasn't on the menu!).

Check out the website- they are adding pictures for their menu items. And the prices are just right."}
{"text":"Food was good but they don't accept credit cards and debit! Only CASH ! And they don't have an ATM machine either.

Clearly it shows they don't want to pay taxes, I'm sure they would get a lot more customers if they accepted more payment methods.

It's very shady and disappointing that they only accept CASH !"}
{"text":"I've come here twice so far. If you live in the area, it's a great place to have a hearty meal but if you live in Toronto, it is quite far. 

On a Saturday night, the place was very busy with about 10 minutes of waiting time to be seated. On a Friday afternoon for lunch, the restaraunt wasn't as busy.

The staff are very friendly and attentive. The dishes were well prepared and tasted great. The portions are more than enough, however, lunch menu items are smaller.

The atmosphere and decor is decent.

Definitely would come again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are inexpensive and tasty."}
{"text":"Went there on fathers day. It was very busy but service was very good. Dinner was ok.  Won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"I have been to Restoran Malaysia quite a number of times but nothing beats the first time experience I had where everything was just amazing. Even though the food quality has gone a little bit on the downside, I believe the service side has gone incredibly down to the point where I have to think twice before coming here next time.

I happened to visit it last Saturday (June 21 2014) for my friend's birthday party. I ordered their drinks which I always love. No issues here. I had ordered the Guava Coconut and it was just amazing. The issue I had was not so much with the food. We had some Satays which was great (especially the mutton one), the Grilled Calamari appetizers were mouth watering with the sauces. The fried chicken was nice crispy and spicy. The main entrees were satisfactory and the ginger tea I had at the end was tasting as authentic as it can get.

The issue was with the service. We had asked to split our bills for which they were very adamant sayings it's a big hassle to them. But to get that answer form them took about good 10 minutes as the waiter was simply confused of our ask. When the food arrived one of the plates had a fly in it. It was immediately replaced when requested but usually restaurants give that food as a complimentary or apologizes intensely, trying to make up for the mishap by any way possible by offering a dessert portion or free drinks etc etc. But none of this happened. It almost felt as if the restaurant felt that simply replacing the food with the fly solves everything. I beg to differ. A restaurant usually takes extra care of its customer when something like this occurs. I was rather taken back by this service. And the waiters in general were just too confused with anything. Too many ppl in the restaurant takes away from the attentiveness of the waiters. They were just all over the place. Service needs a lot of improvement here."}
{"text":"I am not sure if this place has authentic flavour but, we really enjoyed all the dishes we ordered so far. We have been coming back here more than two years and this place is always packed at dinner time.  
The service is usually pretty good, most of the dishes comes pretty fast as well. 
Loved the satay, the Indonesian Nasi goreng, char kuay teow, Singapore Laksa, Curry with Roti, fried okra and so on...
Mango milk shake is also highly recommended if you wish to order some beverages!"}
{"text":"The best Malaysian restaurant in Toronto!

-Roti Pratha: Taste like what I had in Malaysia, enough said.

-Ayam Goreng Kampoeng: Taste like what my mom made. Eating this makes me feel nostalgic of home.

-Teh Tarik: The taste is okay, but I think they need to 'pull' more so it becomes frothier.

-Mama Mee Goreng: Taste very similar to Javanese Fried Noodle that I used to eat from street carts back home.

I would recommend this place if you want a truly authentic Malaysia food. The only thing I hate is how far this place is from downtown that I can't go there more often. We  (went there with a friend who has a car) also wanted to order the Kangkung Belacan, but they didn't have it because it's not in season. I will definitely try to come again during the summer. Oh, and it you're allergic to nuts, I suggest to eat someplace else. Malaysian food is heavily spiced with nuts. They'll probably give you some substitute which will probably change the flavor."}
{"text":"Interior was a surprise, I expected diner or dive, not casual nice.
Tastefully decorated, contemporary Asian.  I like it.
 Portions were generous.  Our table had:
Pad Thai and Cashew Chicken.  I thought they were average; not bad, not great.
The Pad Thai had the orangy tamarind sauce. and the noodles were very moist.
I like a dryer, not so orangy noodle.

I ordered the Nasi Remak Melaka, described to me as a typical/traditional Malaysian dish.  The coconut rice was fragrant had a great texture, the surprises were the little fish in sauce.  That's OK, I'm Asian, I eat just about anything, it just wasn't a favorite. The rest of the dish was boiled egg, peanuts, and the beef.  Glad I tried it, but I'd order something else next time.

And that something else is Mamak Mee Goring!  My SIL ordered this and visually and taste-ily this was the best dish of the night.  The noodles had a great texture, not too soft,  the flavor was fragrant and rich.  She shared a bite, and saw that look on my face that said I'd eat it all if she gave me half a minute.  Yes!  Next time!"}
{"text":"Best Malaysian in the city. Great noodle and rice options. Pulled tea is the after dinner highlight."}
{"text":"Great food, always get the pineapple chicken, pad thai (the best in town!) and the calamari satay. Biggest issue is the parking and that they only accept cash! If you're planning on having a beer or a drink don't bother, find another place because they don't serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Always clean. Always on point. Their service is a bit slow but extremely polite people  . I've been coming here for the past 11 years. And I love it !!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is big and busy! I have to say for a place so busy you have to wonder why is it cash only? 

The rendang beef was ok. Nice flavours but the beef was very dry and shredded I've had better rendang at Soos and Mathahari where they have really Malaysian food.

And yes when I paid if took a long time to get change. Go figure. 

You just have to go to Soos the chef is brilliant."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Restoran Malaysia. The front door is flooded with awards and news articles, raving about the food. This excited me. As I entered, the entire place was filled with the aroma of curries and other delicious smelling things I cannot describe.

I ordered the coconut rice, beef curry, their flat rice noodle dish, corn soup and rotis on the side

Everything was delicious, fresh and hot. I really enjoyed their noodle dish. it was flavourful, hot from the wok, and spicy. The beef curry was also tasty when paired with the rice and roti.

I will be returning to Restoran Malaysia to try other things on the menu. 5/5 * stars"}
{"text":"Amazing Malaysian food, one of the best I've ever had! Good service but it is extremely busy and usually packed. There was not one dish I disliked and I'm not a huge curry fan but I loved it here. The tamarind fish was so unexpectedly delicious. The coconut drink is so refreshing as well. I definitely recommend this place and I am coming back for more."}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed with the last visit, we have been going to this restaurant for years, but the food quality has been slowly decreasing and they have been cutting back (no more lunch menu). They have only been accepting cash for a year or so, and that was fine. But after the last visit both of us had become sick, and sadly we will not return. Hope others have a better experience."}
{"text":"I have been here ever since I was 10 years old. This place has evolved in such a great way and is a great deal. My mother is actually from Malaysia and she says that is close as you can get to the authentic Malya food. The prices are awesome and I highly suggest getting the Singapore laska."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY impressed with the quality of service and food at Restoran Malaysia. Three people in my party of 5 decided on the pineapple fried rice and wow! Packed with the tangy flavours of the pineapple produced a unique blend of sweet and savoury. The portions were big and generous, enough to share between two people. But if you have a big belly like me, one plate will satisfy you tremendously. Also, the prices are out of this world considering everything. My meal came to $10 for a huge plate of fried rice 

Amazing experience and I would definitely come back to try the other lunch options."}
{"text":"This is a place my Malaysian friends approved of.  This place is good!  Ordered take out.  Tried the chicken and beef satay, green curry with beef, pad thai, Singapore laksa, pineapple fried rice, roti prata and one more dish I can't remember.  Washed it down with an ice cold coke because forgot to try the teh tarik.  Liked everything I ate! Bit far for me but I will return if I'm in the area.   Many other items I need to try!"}
{"text":"We were on a mission...to find tasty Malaysian food.

We packed up the car, made sure we had  enough bottled water..and started our journey from downtown to the far away land of Richmond Hill.

After a few wrong turns, we turned to our handheld electronic devices for guidance.

And then we saw it...
Restoran Malaysia.

We opened the doors to see that the venue was packed! 
The locals were friendly and offered us an extensive menu.

We started with the roti and curry beef.  The roti was delicious, the curry was spicy and tasty... but  more runny than expected.

The hockien mee was a thick yellow noodle dish with seafood braised in a dark sauce.  Good amount of seafood but a bit saucy.

The sing chicken rice came with a soup and the hot sauce added an extra kick!  The rice was a bit dryer but the chicken was boneless and moist.

As for beverages, the Malaysian cooler was pineapple and coconut cream goodness.

The teh tarik is exceptional here. A nice hot tea to have with dessert!
Not too sweet with a smooth texture.

I will come back again, but probably order a fried rice, a non-appetizer curry, and a different dish of noodles.

We had the sago gula melaka (sweet cream, caramel on sago) for dessert.  Next time I will go for a glutinous rice dessert instead.

The trek north was worth it. We left happy with our meal and promised to one day return."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in uptown! I've been coming to this restaurant for 3-4 years now and every dish I've tried had been very good. 
The standard Pad Thai is made well here, with the noodle not clumping together and complemented nicely with crushed peanuts and lime. The red curry chicken is slightly spicy and filled with bamboo shoots, baby corn and the wonderful aroma of basil leaves. Another one of my favourite is the Laksa noodle (a bit spicy) and Ipoh noodle soup (it's in a clear chicken broth). The teh tarik (pulled milk tea) is made with strong black tea and it's so smooooth! 

The service is fast and friendly but expect to wait for tables during busy hours. (weekend dinners) Also to note, the food here is all halal. Happy eating =)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since high school days when they just opened! Their food and service has always been consistent and had never ever had a bad experience with them. Chicken fried rice and Nasi goring are my fav. They also have the best plum sauce.  Their portions are always big and more than enough for two people! Great place for family and their food is halal.
Cash only!!!!!! Their green curry thai is extremely spicy ! Their pho is also fresh. Will never stop coming here ."}
{"text":"Never had malaysian food before but it's super fresh, tasty, and all meat dishes can be turned veg upon request, no problem.  Very yummy!"}
{"text":"Used to go here more frequently in the past. Service and quality of food used to be much better. Some servings are good others for inexplicable reasons are small such as the chicken curry. The curry itself was flat - nothing compared to the standards that used to exist here previously. Menu's are all tattered. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Really great Malaysian food here! I feel like it's more authentic than other places(but what do I know?), the dishes are also very generously proportioned. I can eat fairly spicy and the green curry is bomb."}
{"text":"This is the first time having Malaysian food and I absolutely love it. Everything is family style but the quantity of food they give it is overwhelming.

Few friends from high school decided to meet up and they've recommended this place. I love the Roti, satayed beef, and the curry from this place. The fried rice was delicious too.
 
If you're not in the area, and you don't mind a drive to have some malaysian, good Malaysian food, this is the place."}
{"text":"I do enjoy my dining experience here at Restoran Malaysia every single time I visit. They do get quite busy during dinner rush hours. I would suggest to come earlier if you can. It is multicultural and a very casual ambience. I see people come in large groups.

Food is good and I think it's worth it for the portion that they serve. Any noodles and rice plate you get, it's meant more for sharing in my opinion. You can pretty much share anything you order from the menu. I really enjoy their different type skewers (chicken/beef), tom yum soup, Singapore laksa, fried chicken with shrimp chips, pad Thai, roti with curry sauce, and also their pineapple fried rice. I'm sure they have many more delicious dishes but these are generally my go-to. 

One downfall about this restaurant is that they only accept cash. If you are in the area and wanted to have some Malaysian food, I highly recommend to give this place a try."}
{"text":"One of the best Malaysian restaurants left in Toronto.

I know it seems like a hit and miss for others, but the Roti Canai for me was perfect. I like it a bit chewy, less flaky and I found it very yummy. The curry was a bit too thin, but it had the taste of a curry, just not enough spice.

I like the chicken rice, the Nonya deep fried chicken with the keropok (MMM!) and my family always takes the ice kachang dessert (which I don't like).

I also suggest trying the Ais rose flavoured drink because I'm a fiend for the rose syrup.

The service is fast, they are family friendly, and the food is hot and fast. No waiting in between courses like at other places!

The prices are also reasonable, although a bit on the high side, although it is worth it to eat such good food."}
{"text":"A gem of a Nonya Malaysian restaurant tucked away in a nondescript strip mall.  Even from the front door, its hard to imagine a rather large dining area appointed in black and gold awaits you inside.

Menu is comprehensive and hits all the mandatory choices.  Some items seem a bit incongruous such as pad thai and some of the soups but I assume that they have to cater to some locals who don't know the difference with Thai cuisine.

The dishes I ordered were all well executed and portions were just right. Service friendly and attentive.

My biggest gripe is that they didn't serve alcohol. How can anyone enjoy any spicy SE Asian food without a beer to wash it down. I'm guessing that licensing is pretty strict in these parts."}
{"text":"Crisp Chicken Wings
The chicken wings are crispy and I certainly like the sweet and sour sauce that comes with it. Just that the chicken wings are bit small.

Roti Pisang
It is banana wrapped with crepe and has condensed milk on top of the crepe. It is a kind of appetizer. It does taste good with the banana. I just don't like the condensed me with it. It may be better just with the banana in the crepe. Taste more like a dessert to me than an appetizer.

Penang Gulai Nonya
This is a curry dish in Penang style. It is not very spicy. In fact it tastes slightly sweet which easy to eat, especially with the coconut rice.

Penang Char Kuay Teow
I am a bit disappointed in this dish. It is just like thick noodles fried with soy sauce and sprouts. 

Shaved Ice Dessert
It tastes so delicious. There is a lychee on top of the shaved ice with syrup poured over the ice. At the bottom of the bowl, it has sweet jelly cubes, sweet beans, and corns etc. It tastes very refreshing eating this dessert.

From all the dishes, I like the Penang Gulai Nonya and the dessert the most. I will definitely come back for other dishes."}
{"text":"So delicious!  Went here last night for the first time and it was on - point!  Half hour wait though but whatever, I heard the food was good. 

We ordered mutton curry, devil chicken (maybe I forgot the name..but it's definitely devil something) and roti curry to share. Our server - Dennis - was very nice and asked about any allergies which was a nice touch. We wanted to order mango salad but they didn't have any #sadface

Everything came out quickly and it was so worth the wait. The rotis were soft and fluffy and so good! 

I'll definitely come again and will try the fried rice and noodles. 

Bill came to $45. Not too bad and we had leftovers :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had a fantastic experience both times. It was busy on the Saturday night I went and we were actually lucky there was no waiting time. Their decor is clean and it is quite spacious. 

I was craving some non-traditional comfort food and this place was the first to pop up in my head. Their portions are generous and for the price, it's well worth it. The roti with curry chicken is an absolute must if you come here (to die for). We ordered a total of 5-6 dishes bw the 3 of us and we brought home about 3 half-eaten dishes. Another dish worth trying would be the shrimp chips. It goes SO well with any leftover curry you have.

The service is relatively quick and they're extremely helpful when it comes to ordering by giving you some suggestions.

Without a doubt, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy southeast Asian food. Rotti and curries were heaven. Repeat: yes, but only if in the area."}
{"text":"Having spent a large chunk of my life in Singapore I know a great deal about singaporean & malaysian food. I have to admit that this place is pretty good in terms of authenticity and quality of food. The biggest thing that bums me out about this place is the prices. Malaysian coffee in hawkers is probably 50 cents maybe a buck or two for upscale places tops. Here its $6 + tax+ tip, its the biggest markup I've ever witnessed. It makes me think how much exactly does it cost to ship coffee for it to cost so much.

Don't get me wrong, this place is great. But just knowing that you can get the same dish (even better) at 1/8th the cost is hard to get over.

I still will rate this place highly because i know I'm in Canada which in itself is a reason to jackup the price. 

Note: pad thai is great here"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night since it's rated pretty high and to see how it compares to Gourmet Malaysia. They don't take reservations for weekend evenings, luckily it was just myself and a friend so we only had to wait 20 minutes for a table.
Long story short... It's just okay - hit and miss. Although the space is nicer, don't think I'll be back... Gourmet Malaysia's food is far better and closer to me.
We ordered:
- Roti canai with chicken curry
Curry was good, a bit spicy. Roti was ok, it's flatter and not so flaky
- Beef satay
Good flavour... No complaints.
- Nasi lemak
Everything but the beef rendang that came with it was good... Beef was flavourless and a tad dry
- Pad thai (since my friend was not familiar with Malay food)
So bland! My friend thinks it's cuz this came last and the rest of our order had strong flavour... I've had way flavourful pad thai.
- Teh tarik
It was good, but like one of the previous reviews... It needs to be pulled more
Bill came up to $60 plus tip. Service was fast and friendly. Decor is modern."}
{"text":"Service was good, we were seated quickly. Our server gave us recommendations on their most popular items. The food was just ok, the flavor could have been a better. They accepted cash only."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place all the time but the quality has definitely gone down recently. They've been wildly successful but their customer service is non existant - as we ate our food we told them it was not fresh but they refused to take it off the bill. On top of that the cash only thing because their machine is broken is pure nonsense....can you say tax evasion?"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I did not have the greatest experience at dinner tonight. I frequent the restaurant in the past but the service today was subpar. The restaurant was not busy but our drinks took long to arrive, and arrived nearly after we had finished our appetizers and main dishes. My drink was actually handed to another customer at another table who had just sat down and placed an order. The waitress seemed quite frazzled and when we corrected her error. The worst was that the waitress did not check whether the drink had already been consumed by the other customer and she had simply left it on our table. 

I did not finish my curry and left quite a substantive amount in the bowl. I had ensured to let the waitress know to pack the entire content. She kindly packed my leftover but it came back in a very small container. It would seem that the remainder of my food was simply discarded even though I had wanted the whole thing. 

This was an unfortunate experience today and I must say, was not typical based on my past experiences. However, taking into account the drive we had to make to come to this restaurant and the subpar experience, I am unsure if I will come back. 

Having said that, the food was good and I have absolutely nothing bad to say that about that, thus my 2 stars rating."}
{"text":"Even 1 star is too much for this place. We were visiting from USA this place was absolutely Overpriced, and disgusting food, will never trust these people with what they'll put in the food and serve you, if you don't know what the food should look like or taste like then good luck. Horrible, horrible service, bad attitude was their second language. It seemed like they were doing us a favor by letting us eat at the restaurant. All of them had bad attitudes. Waitress brought wrong dish to the table and insisted we keep it otherwise she will have to pay for it, we explained that no one on our table eats fish and we ordered shrimp but she insisted that we pay for the dish, we requested for manager and she refused and said it was not necessary to call for manager then another waitress came acting like she will solve the problem she took the dish back and brought what we ordered, but something was wrong with the dish, it smelled horribly and looked disgusting, the employees were giggling, smirking and  giving high five to each other, these people had no concision, my guests were in shock with the treatment we were receiving and the food. If I didn't have guest with me things would have been very different. They did not take Credit card and did not want to take US dollars, the cashier said we are not, currency exchange, Needless to say we paid for overpriced food and walked away hungry with a bad taste in our mouth. Never every will go there or recommend anyone unless you want to ruin your evening and throw your money."}
{"text":"Hit Restoran Malaysia for dinner last night before heading home to Ottawa. It was our first visit to a Malaysian restaurant, but we went with a pro (a friend who spent some time in Malaysia)

Ambiance: The restaurant has a classy look to it. You can definitely go casual (we did) but you wouldn't feel totally out of place a little more dressed up, either. It's very big, so I'm sure it would be good for groups. 

Service: Might be a little biased since we were with a cousin of our server, but the service was attentive, polite and helpful. 

Food: The food was very tasty! The dishes we had were similar to Thai, Indonesian, and Indian food. For most of the entrees you can choose what kind of protein you'd like. Pork (and alcohol!) isn't an option here since the restaurant is halal. 

The roti canai, a Malaysian flatbread, is a slightly flaky flatbread that is eaten with curry. Our friend tells me that it's not as flaky as real Malaysian roti and there's a place in Scarborough that does it better, but having never had roti canai I quite enjoyed it and would recommend it. We didn't order the roti with curry as an item from the menu, but instead ordered roti on their own and, at the suggestion of our server, green beef curry from the entrees, which was a good combination. We also had an eggplant dish, roast chicken and rice, and calamari sambal. It was all very tasty. This was an appropriate amount of food for four people - we could have taken home a small amount of leftovers, but we decided to overeat instead! 

Definitely recommend Restoran Malaysia if you're in the mood for something a little different."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Banana Leaf in Vancouver

Great price, good food, large portions and awesome service.

Only down side is having to pay cash."}
{"text":"For a Malaysian restoran, I meant restaurant, the food is the best around town.  I've been there 5-6 times and not one dish disappoints.  Try the Rotti with plain curry (without anything), it's cheap and good!  The seafood Dong Yum Gong soup is very good!  Also the drinks are not expensive for that kind of quality, so don't forget to try that.  

CONS: Service can be slow sometimes, and they don't open on mondays.  These could also be pluses.

What the hec is restoran anyway, I have to call the owner to tell them about the spelling mistake. It makes them look stupid, but I don't mind as long as the food is good!"}
{"text":"Best Malaysian food in the GTA. Their roti with curry is a must try. The roti is so good - chewy and tasty, has a bit of a sweetness to it, I love it. Their laksa too is probably the best I've had. It has a generous amount of chicken, tofu and fish cakes/balls. Their base is coconut milk, so it is very creamy and just full of flavour. It's also not too spicy. I always come here for their laksa. Satay chicken is also good. Overall you can't go wrong with most of the items in their menu. Customer service is good, wait times for food is very quick and the restaurant itself has a big capacity so the wait times to sit shouldn't be too long. Book a table to be safe. Also, one downside is that it's cash only."}
{"text":"I've been to this place with a bunch of different non-overlappng friend groups (not at my suggestion mind you) and due to the science of statistics, that means this place is good right? Read on and find out.

So this unassuming restaurant is nestled in a tiny plaza where parking spots are sparse. Inside, it looks like most asian - Thai places: dark lighting, gold decorations, a Buddha, etc. It gives a very authentic atmosphere but does the food reflect that? We ordered curry chicken roti (delicious), Singaporean laksa (good), fried rice (huge!), Rendang (a ground beef - coconut milk mixture), and some stir fried rice noodles (good). I washed everything down with an Indonesian pulled ice tea, which reminded me of a Thai ice tea, but stronger flavor and less sweet. So as you can tell, everything was good, portions were large for the price, and my Indonesian lady companion said it's one of the most authentic places in the GTA. The service was above average (especially for an Asian place) and food came readily too. The only real downside is that it's cash only. Yes, I get it. No one likes paying fees (or taxes) but this is an upscale asian place in Richmond hill you bring people to impress - not some hole in the wall Chinese diner where you expect the washroom to double as a pantry. I like the food when I'm in the mood, but knowing I need cash as a prerequisite before entering is a bit of a deterrent for me."}
{"text":"Their version of chow keuh teow is one of my favorites.  Roti canai is also a must order for me when dining at Malaysian restaurant and this version is as tasty as any I have had.

This place is popular so be prepared to wait.  Nice decor and friendly service.  Prices are a little higher than it should be, but I guess they can get away with it ..."}
{"text":"Quality has gone down. The shrimp in tom yum was very stale. Vegetables were cut very big in the malasian curry. Roti was not cooked all the way. I will not return but i remember the good days."}
{"text":"Huge portions for a great price. We went for on weekday lunch and it was quite busy!! Lunch menu ranges from $7-9 and the portions are huge. 
I had the Malay vegetable curry and it was great. My friend had the pad Thai, it had both shrimp and chicken and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Still cash only"}
{"text":"The food is really good (& I believe authentic but I'm not Malaysian)... Service has always been on par. 
The only issue is that they don't accept credit or debit - cash only!"}
{"text":"Food taste: Good.

Ambience: Too crowded. Torn seats. Ill-maintained interiors. No investments on making it all look good.

Servers: They are always in a rush.

Price for two (dinner): approx.  $45

They accept only cash. this is a major deterrent!!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for over ten years. The quality of the food has never changed, always fresh and delicious! Their curry with sweet roti is sensational as is the pineapple fried rice. Wonderful noodle dishes. Try one of their different salads as well. They are also known for their specialty non alcoholic, (establishment is Halal,) drinks. A little more expensive than similar places, but you do get what you pay for. Even after they renovated and expanded, it is common to have to wait 30 minutes for a table. Worth the wait.

{"text":"Been here twice once for lunch and dinner.  I have tried the pad thai, green curry chicken with the roti, fried rice, yellow curry beef with roti and bunch of platters.  The roti itself is good at $2 each- they are big and fresh.

This place is on the pricey side and I dislike the parking lot.  Also, I am not a fan of resturants that are dark. The wait time at this place can be long especially on weekends.  

Oh yah, And they do not allow reservation so you should call in before you go."}
{"text":"Wahoo!!! Thrilled to be the one to tip this Richmond Hill hot spot over the 100 mark (the first Richmond Hill business to achieve this feat). And totally well deserving of this honor! 100 reviews all saying much the same praise, this place is one to visit in York Region.

Located on the South West corner of Bayview and Major Mackenzie, it's a bit of a trick to navigate to so I recommend you enter off of Maj Mac. Entering I was amazed by how busy this place was only 2 days before Christmas, literally rammed! However the most surprising thing was how fast we were able to obtain a seat (less than 5 minutes to be exact, with a line up). 

In that 5 minutes I was quite taken with the look and feel of this place, not to mention their front of house aquarium (I wonder if any of those fishies are for eating?), the giant Buddha statue looking plump and happy as ever and a giant crystal structure that is quite beautiful (one of those rocks with purple crystals inside). 

Once seated our server was absolutely top shelf. She didnt rush us, she was courteous, hilarious and unbelievably helpful. Once she learned this was our first time visiting RM she was wonderful with her menu recommendations. Which, while delicious were funny because she underestimated how much 2 hungry folks could actually eat. 

To start we had the appetizer platter which came equipped with fish cakes, beef satay skewers (done in a curry style marinade), chicken skewers, and Malaysian style spring rolls. I likely could have eaten a dinner of the beef skewers to my face. Highly recommend! I was a touch wary on the fish cakes but they were only lightly fried and light as anything. I was a fan after only one bite.

My dining companion and I opted to order two main courses and share family style (this is where having multiple people at the table really makes family style much more beneficial). Following the recommendations of our server we ordered one of the Roti plates. She said their Roti was second to none - she was right! The Mutton Roti (if you like lamb/goat) was mind-blasting and a trip into Malaysian flavour country. Nice and spicy and I could have even upped the spice a notch or two more. Damn I'm salivating!

As a second main course to share we had the Penang Fried Kuay Teow. It was a wide short egg noddle dish done with shrimp and bean sprouts and other items. It was amazing! I'd have this 8 days a week if I could - ya that's right 8 days! ya wanna fight about it? Because I'd likely fight you for the last noodle in the plate - delicious!

So what did this feast of endless appetizers, 2 drinks, 2 main courses come to? $52! That's it! Totally reasonable for 2 people to have dinner and leave absolutely stuffed!

I cannot wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Had to be in Toronto today and because of fabulous reviews here drove 20 kms to this Malaysian restaurant.  The service is outstanding, attentive, friendly - everything one could ask for.  We got there early so no parking problems.  Based on reviews we ordered Beef Rendang which I've always wanted to try, Oxtail soup, beef murtabak, chicken curry with 2 rotis, and pad thai.  Oh, and the pulled black tea and a mango ice cream for dessert.  
The beef rendang was so dry, I couldn't force it down. I had trouble swallowing it, and it was still sitting at the end of the meal. Just awful and dry.  No sauce at all.  The Pad Thai was out of this world delicious - best we've had in a very long time.  The oxtail soup was tasty and hearty, the flavor reminded us of Pho with a lot of chilli added in and more spices.  Much like the 5 spice beef soup at the Ben Thanh.  Nice, but a smallish serving and overpriced at $8.00 a bowl.  The beef murtabak was forgettable.  Sort of soft and mushy, kind of pasty and not as flavorful as we expected from the description. The chicken curry was again - Delicious.  Only a very small bowl of it, but really tasty.  Wish we had just stayed with the curry and pad thai.  It was very much hit and miss.  Since we really went for the beef rendang, the trip was a fail as we can get pad thai and curries elsewhere.  Our bill was $63 before tip and good thing I had cash in my pocket as they were not accepting debit or credit cards for some reason.  The restaurant was, by the way, on a Saturday, about 5-5:30 pm almost empty.  Our local Ben Thanh would have lineups by then.  Oh well.  Don't order the beef rendang and save your money on the beef murtabak.  Try the delicious curries and Pad Thai.    Was it just a bad day?  Who knows. 
Hmmm - Just saw the BAD review from yesterday left by someone else.  Boy do I wish I had seen that first.  We could have enjoyed Thai Basil across the street instead...  We definitely will not go back or recommend it.  Basically we paid $75.00 for Pad Thai and a tiny bowl of chicken curry... with one mango ice cream  :-("}
{"text":"I was really upset with my last visit because this restaurant used to be really good. I ordered seafood soup and mamak mee goreng (one of my favorite dishes there), it's spicy fried noodles with chicken and shrimp. The soup was fine but mamak mee goreng tasted horrible - there was some funny taste and I can't tell whether something was screwed up with the spices or some ingredients just weren't fresh. I only tried the meal and sent it back, yet I had stomach cramps a couple of hours later. Still undecided whether to come back or not, once again it used to be really good yet cheap restaurant (that's why this review is 3 stars instead of 1), so hopefully they'll recover back."}
{"text":"Great place for some Malay food. After moving here from California, I was on the hunt for some good Malay food, and finally found it! Def try their chili chicken and Singapore noodles!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Richmond Hill.  Excellent place.
The food is always superb.  Best Pad Thai out of all places I've tried.
Consistent high quality food, great atmosphere, clean and excellent service."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure that I need to yelp this, because EVERYONE and their mother across the GTA seems to know of this highly successful Malaysian restaurant. 

Like Richmond Court, I feel the quality has declined over the past years, yet it still remains a staple for most including myself. I used to frequent this restaurant weekly a few years ago as it was situated 1km from my house. I was so in love with the food back then that I even had my birthday dinner there. Since that last birthday they have made huge renovations and you would never think it looks as classy and chic as it does from the outside. 

The food is fantastic and the portions are sizeable. There are various Malaysian and Thai dishes that have me currently salivating as I ponder. Assorted satay skewers, assorted tom yam soups, spring rolls, rotis and stuffed rotis round out the apps. When it comes to meats and seafoods, there are at least 20 selections for each. All the rice and noodle dishes are mouth watering as well, dishes such as the several different nasi gorengs (fried rice), laksa noodles and various other rice noodle, egg noodles and vermicelli dishes. 
One dish you must get is Penang Fried Kuay Teow, as a texture slut this is my favourite dish at this restaurant. 

For desert there is no way you can not order the Goring Pisang. No matter how full you are, there is always space for this dish. You will smell these sweet crisp banana fritters hit your nasal passage before they hit the table, served with various ice creams such as vanilla, mango and coconut, a must for desert. 

I have one quam with this restaurant however, the menu is too big! I really get turned off by restaurants with such overwhelming menus (ie. Pickle Barrel). Yes I agree you may be trying to please everyone, but it's confusing and it desensitizes various signature dishes as the rest are all spin offs. Nevertheless, this is one place worth checking out if you haven't already. Anything below with a * is an absolute absolute must for me.  

Ideal Order (4 ppl)

Assorted Platter (satays, spring rolls etc.)
Roti & Curry Mutton*
Beef Murtabak (meat stuffed roti)
Malay Kari Ayam (chicken curry)
Sambal Tumis Kampung (beef)
Indonesian Nasi Goreng*
Penang Fried Kuay Teow*
Goring Pisang w/ Vanilla Ice Cream*
Teh Tarik (you have to watch buddy pour this drink)
Iced Lychee*

*I would recommend staying away from the common dishes you may be a custom to such as the chili chicken, pad thai, sweet & sour meats etc. It's best to stick to the selections above, or more traditional selections. Explore a bit!

4.3/5"}
{"text":"Food is really average at best. Don't know how this restaurant is at a four star status but there really aren't a lot of options for Malaysian food in Richmond Hill. 
Their hot sauce is really good though. My boyfriend knows his hot sauce and he was obsessed. Hot sauce is available for sale."}
{"text":"Every time I'm craving for Malaysian food, two places come to mind.  Restoran Malaysia and Gourmet Garden in Scarborough.

If I wanted to sit and dine out, I go to Restoran Malaysia.

The last time I went there, we ordered the following.

Beef Rendang
Saffron Chicken
Kang Kung with belachan
Fried Kuay Teow

The quality and taste of the food has been very consistent.  Portions are just nice.  

Service has always been good and attentive.  

I would definitely keep returning to Restoran Malaysia when I am back in Toronto. I have yet to try a lot of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Out of the two Malaysian restaurants I know of in Toronto (GTA) this is absolutely the best! Quick and courteous service, hot fresh food, that is authentic and hearty. I wish they had alcohol, for nights out with friends and family when you would like a glass of wine during dinner, but that's not a big deal. I've been here several times and they never disappoint! If you've never had Malaysian food or been here, this is a must try. One of the few places I know where the noodles/rice have a strong wok taste, which is hard to find! The pulled tea is delicious as well, kind of like Hong Kong milk tea but creamier and stronger."}
{"text":"It was totally worth the trek on a cold rainy night. 
Being Saturday, the wait time was 30 mins so we decided to do a take-out. We got the Roti Canai with Mutton curry, nasi goreng and the Sambal Tumis Kampung - Ayam. Like someone already mentioned, the Nasi Goreng portion was massive - we have leftovers for both of us for lunch :) The dishes were delicious and I am definitely a fan but not sure I want to wait to get a table. Take out works for me."}
{"text":"Our hunt for decent Thai food in Markham continues...

We decided to stop here to trial their lunch menu this week because I was craving spicy sauce on rice that usually isn't satisfied until I get my curry fix. Their lunch menu runs from open until 3pm and most dishes are $9 or less before tax and tip. 

Off the lunch menu, I ordered the Thai red curry chicken and my companion ordered the Penang Char Kuay Teow. The Thai red curry chicken was decent, but definitely not the best I've had. The sauce was more watery than creamy, and the chicken was drier than I'd like. It did the job though, a decent saucy rice dish to satisfy my craving. The Penang Char Kuay Teow is a soy sauce based rice noodle dish that came with egg, shrimp and chillies. It wasn't as spicy as we'd hope, but it was tasty enough. 

While the food is mediocre, the service and atmosphere is pretty good. The service was quick, and the waitress' were pleasant. The ambience is nice, the restaurant is clean and the chairs are comfortable. 

Note: cash only and no outside drinks allowed."}
{"text":"We have been fans of Restoran Malaysia since the early days when they were just a hole in the wall establishment.  We usually get takeout but on occasion eat in at lunch.  Their lunch specials are a great deal.  They are very accommodating for vegetarians and vegans.

I usually get the malay vegetarian curry which is full of flavour with whole spices - cardamom, star anise, cloves. Spicing is very mild so I usually ask for spicy.  I have also tried veg versions of their Penang char kuay teow (2nd favourite), pad thai, mamak mee goring.  Mr Leny usually sticks with the chili chicken.  Prices may seem high but the portions are huge.

I also highly recommend the pulled tea (teh tarik) and the sago gula melaka for dessert."}
{"text":"Isn't it amazing that suburban restaurant has over 100 reviews on yelp! That speaks for itself!! Do I even need to write this review?!

This was probably my 3rd or 4th trip to Restoran Malaysia and like every time the food was delicious! I find the service a hit or miss but it was pretty good this time. The servers were attentive of guests fasting in Ramadan and brought out their food under two minutes of breaking the fast. One of the severs helped my friend out in chosing a drink when she didnt like the teh tarik as much

I on the other hand, love teh tarik. Maybe i'd add a tiny bit of sweetener or sugar though. The food this time was the best! Nasi Goreng (mixed fried rice) with a fried egg on top. Fried egg on anything makes my life complete! We also ordered the Sambal chicken (think that's what it was called) which had good flavour, a bright red colour and nice spicy kick. 

The roti.. the roti always takes the cake here.. Yummy soft fresh roti with amazing tasting curry sauce! I could eat that all day.. (and I'm literally salivating right now) 

Sadly in all my trips to Restoran Malaysia I've never tried their dessert - that's cuz I'm always so full from stuffing my face with their awesome food!

I dont care where you live, drive up to Richmond Hill, my old hometown and visit this place - it'll be worth it"}
{"text":"Restoran Malaysia is one of the best restaurants in Richmond Hill, hands down.  They have incredible food based on a wide selection and the prices are great.  Since their renovation a few years back, the atmosphere has improved greatly.  The service is quick every time, and only sometimes do you have to wait for a seat.  

I only have two beefs with this restaurant.  First, the food is never spicy enough.  I love my food \"kick-your-ass\" spicy, and no matter how many times I ask for the food to be made spicier, it is never quite up to par.  Maybe they don't think I can handle the heat?  I'm not sure, but this should change.  Second, the tables in the middle section are extremely close together.  I know this is somewhat usual practice for Asian restaurants, but come on we're in Richmond Hill and there's plenty of real estate inside the restaurant.  It feels weird pretty much sharing a table with strangers and it's a conversation killer.

But those are two minor complaints, really.  Overall this is probably my favourite restaurant in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I think I tried everything on the menu LOL, only downside to this place is some waitresses are a bit rude,it's a little pricey and CASH ONLY! However I overlook all of the above for consistently flavourful ethnic food. The first time I came here was 10 years ago and I think nothing has changed except for the expansion. The best things are: Cinderella Mocktail, Satay BEEF, Pad Thai, Roti and Coconut Beef Curry, Nasi Goreng, and honestly any noodle. Be careful of the spice level of some dishes, all of their desserts are also good but $$, I really like the coconut crepes and sago pudding!! HMMMMMM"}
{"text":"I am not a fan for Curry first of all. and the malaysia curry fish I have ordered really disappointed me. the fish is over-fried and no taste."}
{"text":"Unique food and drinks combination. Spicy but not overbearing. There won't be a dish you don't like.  Yes it's noodles, rice and curry but made in a totally different way. Ordering several plates and share is the way to go. Nice relaxed atmosphere too. Still only take cash only."}
{"text":"Such a good place. Service is great and the food quality is so good. Worth a try if you like Malaysian, Chinese and Indian food!!"}
{"text":"It makes me sad that this place doesn't have the high yelp reviews that it deserves.  I had this once the last time I came to Toronto (several years ago) and knew that I wanted to come back.  It was just as excellent as I remembered.  We got the roti telor with chicken curry to share (excellent).  And then we got the roti and condensed milk because we were curious (it's exactly what it sounds like and its actually good).  I got the singapore laksa which was GREAT.  Excellent curry soup with great additions and this place has huuuuge portions, which I did not remember but was pleasantly surprised by.  Mmm... delicious."}
{"text":"Went there with my Malaysian friend. Although far from dt, really worth the travel. My first try of Malaysian food, but I LOVE the flavor. Highly recommend the fried egg rice noodle and water spinach dishes with special sauce. Laksa is also good. The egg rice noodle is so special that I've never had anything similar to that before."}
{"text":"FOOD:
Delicious. Full flavour in all their dishes. The shrimp chips are to die for. If you order the Indonesian fried rice, it comes with it on the side. I recommend their homemade roti with curry as an appetizer. Not too greasy. Delicious. Their satay skewers were one of the best I've had. 
SERVICE:
Friendly wait staff. Food came fast. Infinitely better than the average chinese restaurant. 
ATMOSPHERE:
Comfortable seating. Dimmed light. Overall good atmosphere. The tables are large which makes sharing platters easy. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Dessert is sweet and tasty. Unfortunately, quality has gone down hill but service is still good. Flavours are great but prices have also shot up. Milk tea is pulled and aerated and quite good.

They haven't bothered to fix their credit/debit machines so cash only."}
{"text":"Now, if you were to ask me what I wanted for dinner, Malaysian food is pretty much the last thing on my mind. Not cause I don't like it. More because I never remember it! Lol. 

This is one of my brothers favourite Malaysian restaurants, so we headed here on his recommendation. The food was quite good, as I'm a sucker for good curry, but the service was a bit lacking...

First off, the Cold Tea here is amazing. Its the kind where the pull the tea from jug to jug, making it super smooth! Definitely worth a try!
We got the Mango Salad, Roti with Curry Sauce, Yellow Curry with Chicken, Pineapple Fried Rice, Vegetable Spring Rolls, and Garlic Choy Sum. The highlights were definitely the Yellow Curry with Chicken, as it was flavourful with enough spice, but still light. The Pineapple Fried Rice was good too, but mixed with some curry was even better!

The portions here are either small or big. Nothing really in the middle. The fried rice was enough to share, but everything had me wanting more. The worst was the Roti. The order originally came with 2, but needed us to add 2 more! It would have been a waste of the curry sauce, let alone not being filling enough. That's probably how they get you!
The service was quick, but you got an overwhelming feeling that the staff really didn't want to be there. 

One of the only Malaysian restaurants I know in the relative vicinity, so if you're into Malay, definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I dream about this food! The curry and roti is amazing but I adore the Tom Yum soup and the Char Kuay Teow."}
{"text":"terrible service. would never eat here again. the food took forever, felt like it wasn't fresh. they only accept cash, when I asked for a receipt they said they could not provide me one. feels very shady."}
{"text":"Delicious Pad Thai! Have been ordering takeout food from this restaurant for years now! Highly recommend if you like Malaysian food. Some portions are large so I suggest sharing if you are in a group/with family."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of them.  However after they got my takeout order wrong a few times I stopped being a fan.  It sucks when you preorder you food, take it home and then open it to realize they messed up ur order. 

Next time check your order before you order take out.  This happened the summer of 2013 when I was an intern at in the area.  Sucks when you have a 1hr lunch break, and upon getting it exchanged they just give me my correct order with no bonus for my trouble."}
{"text":"I came here once before with my family - years ago when it was a much newer venture - but I didn't remember much of the food I had at Restoran Malaysia when I returned nearly a decade later for a visit with a group of eight. This time I will definitely remember it - family-friendly setting, cozy atmosphere and great food! Apart from a very fishy noodle soup I had, everything was pretty good! I really enjoyed the pad Thai and the egg pitas are one that might be enjoyed by South Asian parents in particular (mogulai paratha). The Tom yum soup we started with was spicy and lemony and quite flavourful - I'm not a huge soup fan myself but my aunties are and they thought it was great. Nonya pelaka chicken is pretty good, but think the resto does beef better - the Rendang was very tasty and enjoyed by the whole family. I would caution you against ordering too many plates if you come with a group as the portions are quite generous. It's a nice place, and conveniently halal too :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant had amazing service. I was very impressed my waiter Tom. He was very polite and got everything that the table wanted. Also, the food was abover par. I was not expecting the food to be that good. Overall 8/10"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and liked their food and their prices. I've always thought the service was a hit or miss and I hated that they don't take reservations which deters me from coming on the weekend. However lately, this place has become extremely snooty since the quality of service has gone down. The new cash only policy is definitely not preferred for those of us who likes our plastics. And Who knows why they have this policy now. 

In addition, just yesterday I was there with my family and I was ordering for them. I pointed to what I wanted on the menu and read out the name of the dish black peppered beef ... Kuay teow. Before I could finish the waitress interrupted me and said the fried kuay teow noodles. Well the dish was fried so I said yes. When the dish came it was obviously not what I wanted. So I told her and she said you ordered the fried kuay teow noodles this is it. I said I ordered the beef one. I guess she didn't hear me say the beef part. And instead of apologizing or even better taking it back she just said \"Oh\" and left the table. I clearly said the beef part it was her mistake that she \"assumed\" I wanted something else. And then accused me of ordering the wrong thing. If she didn't hear me correctly she should have verified with me or apologize or fix it. Which she did none of. Overall my latest experience was terrible and I feel like they feel like they have so much business they no longer care. Needless to say I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Very good food considering the reasonable prices. Have been going there for lunch for many years."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for malaysian food. The Nasi goreng is a no brainer and definitely get the Murtabak with curry dipping sauce. Their pad thai won't disappoint. They don't serve alcohol but their fresh juice is amazing- I recommend the mango!  Ask for their hot sauce on the side which I believe they make in house, so good."}
{"text":"Spicy, but not too hot.  Exceptionally attentive service, super speedy orders.  Very decent sized portions.  The kuey teow was deliciously chewy, and the Penang fish curry (can't remember which one!) that we had had a nice balance between 'stuff' and sauce.  The roti to go with the main was extra. I remember coming before it was renovated (which must have been quite a while ago based on all the other reviews here), and I'm quite happy with the new decor.  The talk volume during dinner time in this restaurant is very loud though, so not quite the peaceful dinnertime oasis that the dark, modern decor would imply."}
{"text":"I've been visiting this restaurant for years, whenever I'm in the area. The restaurant has ample seating and free parking but make sure you have cash as they don't accept debit or credit. Their lunch specials are a great deal at around $8 each with large portions, and are available everyday. Would recommend their Malaysian iced tea, gado gado salad, nasi goreng, Singapore chicken rice. Never had a bad dish here."}
{"text":"I love this place! Lunch specials are super cheap and everything I've tried is delicious. The service is also always very friendly. My go to are the chicken wings, pad thai, mutton curry with roti and nasi goring. Tried their char kuay teow recently and loved it as well. A lot of their dishes have that nice smokey flavour from the wok. If it wasn't so far, I'd be here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Authentic Malaysian food. Great atmosphere here. Family friendly. I love the chicken curry with roti and white rice. The food comes fast, hot and delicious. It's a busy restaurant so go early. The nasi lemak is good but we had better. Curry laksa is delicious, be sure to try it. Just order a roti so you can dip. You'll love this place, the staff are great too. Just remember to bring cash, no debit or credit accepted. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for a good meal. The curry has so much flavour here and the portions are very reasonable. I also remember former Toronto Raptors coach Sam Mitchell ate here before too!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. The roti is wicked awesome. The chicken curry, fish, and the whole menu rocks. If you're looking for great food, the best service and a great time, then son you should eat here."}
{"text":"Was up north in and wanted something different. It was also a freezing day, so I was looking forward for some hot curry to warm me up!

Walked into the place and no one even greeted us. After waving at the servers hiding behind the counters and annoucing our arrival, we were finally escorted to a table right by the washroom entrance. Super convenient for washing your hands! 

I got the malay curry and a lychee slushie. The malay curry was spicy, and that unfortunately covered up all the other flavours (ie coconut frangrance, basil, etc). There were also pieces of the beef that had an interesting texture. Some of the beef were quite (too) chewy and had a tendon-like texture. Well, first time for everything right? The lychee slushie was good.

Another thing that bugged me was how the server attempted to clear the plates when I still had food in my plate.

Seeing the earlier yelp reviews, I guess this place really dropped the ball."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. If I'm a regular I should have give it a 5 star but nope its just a 4 star. They have really good curry and roti. Everything else is okay more on the bland side.
Things I don't like-
Cash only
Price higher then usual 
Curry sometimes not hot enough 
$.50 for peanut sauce?"}
{"text":"Nice food but little expensive when it comes to the food quantity. Yes cash only, that's really sucks."}
{"text":"People who enjoy Malaysian food know it is more than one distinction of food due to multi-ethnic population of the country. I am glad TO has this one that specializes in Nyonya dishes and a little bit of everything else from around Malaysia. I am still on search for a good Malay restaurant and an authentic Malaysian Indian place. 

+ Satay appetizer is ok, meat has good texture and seasoning, I didn't like the sauce (too sweet) 
+ Nyonya Fried Chicken, marinated with belachan (yum, the famous shrimp sauce/paste) and fried to crispy perfection 
+ Ikan Penang Gulai Nyonya, fish fillet in a mild curry sauce with veggies. This is supposed to be a mild curry, but their version is just too mild. 
+ Shrimp in Sambal Tumis Kampung sauce, much stronger flavour, the shrimp paste and the spices and chili are well balanced. 
+ Roti Pisang for dessert - Roti stuffed with banana and drizzled with sweet condensed milk. What's not to like. 

Will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and the food was terrible. I called the restaurant back to ask them to exchange the food as it tasted rotten and the owner was really rude on the phone and asked me to drive back to try it herself after having to convince her for 15 mins on phone. I did drive back and then waited like 30 minutes to get the food again before taking it home and eating an hour later. Really disappointed with the service. Don't think I'm ever returning again."}
{"text":"Went here April 21, 2016.

The service was amazing, all the staff is very friendly making for a great experience.

Food, their curry and Roti is delicious, a little small in portion, but it is on the appetizer menu so understandable.  The pineapple fried rice was tasty with nice big and fresh tasting shrimp.  The tea tarik ( possibly spelled wrong) was refreshing with a nice strong tea taste.  

Food is a bit price but worth it.   Only negative I have is that they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Especially the pad Thai and peanut sauce . They also had excellent, friendly service (the waiters and waitresses were changed since the one star review) and the place is very clean and spacious. The place doesn't have the best brightness setting, but it could be great for a \"romantic\" night out. Unfortunately, the food was too good I forgot to take pics. Go for yourself to experience the amazing Malaysian cuisine!"}
{"text":"This place holds a special place in my heart because I've been coming here religiously since I went to high school across the street. Even many many years after I graduated, I still come here to get Thai/Malaysian takeout. The portions here are so generous and a must get is their...roti! It's amazingly delicious and made to perfection. 

They also have a lunch menu with smaller portions and cheaper prices. It is always pretty packed at lunch because of people who work nearby and students of course. If you go get takeout, it's usually 15-20 mins wait maximum. 

Seriously, this place was my first introduction to Thai/Malaysian and I still compare everywhere I go to it."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for a number of years. Good food, lots to slect from, spacious interior for large groups and and probably one of few malaysian places in richmond hill which also happens to serve halal meat. Hence Theres always a wait time. 

The service is hit and miss but every time ive gone the servers are nice and courteous. The food usually comes in a decwnt amount of time.

So far ive tried the pad thai the indonesian fried rice the malai curry chicken the satay chicken and beef and roti tenor. Alll really good. I like their rotis stuffed with egg and meat. Last night's malia chicken was a bit bland and the chciken dry. However the rice was good. I agree with others that it is a littlw watered down flavourwise but still good.

Also they only accept cash. Still find that weird everytime i go."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. They mixed fried rice with papadam and egg was great. Good portion. Little pricey though. Drinks and food arrived on time."}
{"text":"I don't think there are many authentic Malaysian restaurants nearby so it's hard to compare but I had quite an enjoyable meal here.

5/5: The pineapple rice was delicious. There was just the right amount of flavoring that coated each grain of rice and the ingredients were fresh and generously proportioned. The shrimps were large and succulent and the sizeable chunks of pineapples were juicy. 

4/5: The roti was great and it embodied a fragrant aroma of freshly baked bread. It had more of a chewy texture but was still soft and thankfully, not too greasy. The beef curry was quite good too. Although specified as spicy, it wasn't too pungent and I was able to have it despite my low spice tolerance. The beef was alright but probably could've been more tender and I felt that the curry dish was rather small and could've been more generous considering how large the pieces of roti were.

2/5: From other Yelp reviews, the boneless fried chicken seemed to be a favorite but after trying it myself, it really wasn't that great. The chicken was overfried to the point where the skin was just too crispy and dry. The meat wasn't juicy or tender and the dish didn't even come with a sauce!

I would come back for the pineapple rice and perhaps try a few new dishes but definitely would not order the fried chicken again."}
{"text":"Cash only!!! Never understood why they make it such a hassle. However its always a good place to get curry & roti!!! Love their roti! Their drinks are refreshing as well. No reservations and gets busy during weekends"}
{"text":"Ever since I started coming to this restaurant, I feel that the food has gone downhill.  I came here yesterday and I was unimpressed.  We ordered the Tom Yam Seafood Soup, which is always my favourite.  No complaints there.  We also ordered the Roti and Curry Chicken and in my opinion, I thought it tasted very watered down and runny.  For our main dishes, we ordered the Pad Thai, Singapore Laksa and Indonesian Fried Rice.  The Pad Thai did not have much flavour to it, the Singapore Laksa lacked noodles and there was more broth than anything else and the Indonesian Fried Rice was your typical fried rice.  In addition to the not-so-yummy food, the service that was provided by our waitress left me a little annoyed.  Our waitress was rushing us to get out after our dinner service and asked us if we'd finished eating when we were only half-way done.  After a couple minutes, she returned and asked if wanted to pack everything to go.  She even decided that she'd bring us the bill as we packed our food without having us ask cause people were waiting to be seated.  The takeout containers she gave us hardly fit any of our food and we ended up squishing our food in the containers.  Overall, bad impression and I don't think I will be coming back here as often as I once did.."}
{"text":"This restaurant had a nice atmosphere inside. It is a very large restaurant compared to what it may appear to be from the outside so it can accommodate large groups. I personally didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped. It wasn't bad...it was just average. BUT for the price it was good. The lunch menu is decently priced averaging around $8 and you do get your money's worth of food for $8. Their overall menu is quite large and not badly priced either. The service was good. The waiters/waitresses were constantly filling up our waters, taking away dishes and asking if we needed anything. So overall it was a good restaurant but for me it was just average...but do not be afraid to try it. It was not bad."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at the restaurant for almost 20 years.  Family owned, high quality spicy dishes.  Clean, nice ambiance, excellent service.  One of the best Malaysian/Thai places in the city."}
{"text":"Always good golden curry. Have been there many times and will go back again. The only draw back is cash and no credit card"}
{"text":"I always get the chicken noodle soup when I'm feeling under the weather. It always makes me feel so much better!"}
{"text":"SO FLAVOURFUL AND DELICIOUS!
Been my go to, at least monthly, for at least 6 years! Always good! Never been a mistake in order! The spices are so flavourful! Very accommodating if you don't like spicy! It feels like almost all Halal restaurants in the GTA are so bad but we end up eating there just because theyre halal - NOT THIS PLACE! It's halal and still so delicious! 
Something for everyone to eat! Can't wait to go again! 
HOWEVER, BRING CASH!! You cannot pay with anything but cash!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and the restaurant was packed! That was definitely a good sign! Food was delicious! I'll never forget the Roti with Curry Beef. Soooo good! Must try."}
{"text":"Went there because of the nearly perfect review on Yelp, but wasn't amazed as all. Nice environment but nothing special. Flavour and service are both OK."}
{"text":"Getting a lot pricier now and they only accept cash. Will still go on the odd occasion as their dishes have a unique Malaysian taste."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Restoran Malaysia for a few years now, and I never get sick of their pad thai. I know it's a very generic dish but i just love it here! You get a huge portion as well, so for a small Asian girl like myself, it's worth two meals. I guess the annoying thing is that they only take cash, which makes it hard sometimes as the new generation (in my opinion) is used to using card. Lunch is also significantly more than before as they no longer have lunch specials on weekends. I believe the pad thai used to be $8 or 9 for lunch, and now it's $12 so it's quite a big jump. Still worth it though because of the huge portion.
I've also noticed that you get 50% better service when you sit on one side of the restaurant versus the other. I usually get seated on the left side when you walk in the front door, where it's hard to get a server's attention and takes a while for them to come take your order, etc. But when i get seated on the right side the servers are extremely attentive. It's strange, but this is the observation i made after coming here for many occasions."}
{"text":"Very authentic malaysian food.  One Iof the best Pad Thai in Richmond hill."}
{"text":"1 star for cash only policy. Very very inconvenient. 
Came here after long time and was surprised to see cash only policy. Who carries cash nowadays. Especially for restaurant visit."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day lunch with the family. The place was open at 12pm and by 1pm, there were people waiting for tables - pretty popular place. Decor was decent and staff were friendly. We ordered satay (chicken + mutton) - sauce was good, meat was a little dry. Roti Canai (chicken) - this was a hit with my family because the roti was done just right, not oily and the chicken curry was delicious. We also picked a few items from lunch menu - pretty good deals offered up to 3pm. We will definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"Their food was fine, but this has nothing to do with the food, and it is bad enough that makes me think twice about going back again.

Recently they offered a special deal on Groupon, dinner for 2 for $25 or 4 for $45. It is one thing to honour what's on the deal and another thing to go too far and spoil the whole dinner. They would not allow groups of 3 using the $25 coupon, not even when the 3rd person was a 3 year old. They would actually turn people away after they have sat down. A friend of mine saw someone she knew at another table, she went over for a brief chat, IMMEDIATELY a staff came and said a 3rd person wasn't allowed.  Are these people coupon nazis?  If they are too cheap to offer deals, don't offer coupons again, but don't treat customers like thieves. 

I am normally not very active on yelp. I only post when I have tried something outrageously good or like in this case, there is an issue that people should know about. It is my opinion that no matter how good the food is, this kind of petty attitude is a big turn off. Their food is good but isn't great, and not cheap either. I will be happy to offer my money to Thai Basil across the street and not go back to this place."}
{"text":"I was here many years ago and it was pretty good. I went back last week and was not impressed at all. The food is overpriced I find. We ordered the water glory, for $10 the size was extremely small. Plain curry for $5 - very watery. Roti was $2 each. Not only the price was unreasonable, the food weren't as great as before."}
{"text":"On a Saturday, we arrived at 1:30 p.m. and surprisingly still had to wait about five minutes in the foyer before we received a table to sit at.  This restaurant was busy right up until we left at 3:30 p.m.  I was surprised that there were people still dining in for lunch at 3:30 p.m. in the afternoon!

The Roti came in two pieces with the Curry Mutton. The curry mutton was good -- not too spicy with some heat and the mutton was very tender and firm.  Yummy.  The roti was good too and light.  Don't leave the roti on the plate too long though otherwise it becomes cold and too chewy.

The Mixed Beef and Chicken Skewers came with house made peanut sauce and cucumber cubes.  I liked the tender chicken.  We found that the peanut sauce and the meat were quite sweet.  After a while, I wasn't a huge fan of their sweet marinade that they had put on top of the meats.  I'd rather it have been a salty glaze instead.  It was still good in terms of the meat because very tender.

The Mee Goring was a noodle dish with miki noodle, shrimp, chicken, beansprout, tomato, tofu, choy sum (green vegetables), and lime.  I found that there wasn't a lot of chicken in this.  Everything else was visible in the dish.  It was a pretty good stir fried noodle dish.  The portion was quite large too!

At the time of writing, they only accepted cash though."}
{"text":"Another one between 3 star and 4 star ......Might as well just round it lol

I've been to this place many times. It was recommended by a famous food blogger from Malaysia, and at the same time I was reading about the hockien mee in a book and can't wait to try it.

First time I was there i ordered hockien mee right away. It looks/taste exactly like the book described. Very dark soy sauce, but after that. for some reason they changed the soy sauce to a much lighter one. It taste slighter different too. Although I still like it, but I am disappointed.

Malay fried chicken was one of my fave too. Marinated with curry, it was very juicy inside. (Although later i found a better one in gourmet garden in Scarborough, i still like it very much).

I had a chance to try 3 major kind of curry on the menu, but I am not a big big fan of curry dish, so that my memory of those dished didn't last. 

I had one bite of Singapore laksa, it was not bad but not amazing, but I didn't try the soup so that it is not fair to judge. 

Pad Thai was another very pleasant surprise, it has a very nice combination of sweet and sour taste.. hard to describe, have to try it yourself. 

I still think of this place from time to time, and right now every time I go, I still order my hockie mee, only wish when it was served that strong soy sauce color can show up again. 

Recommend:
hockie mee if you are crazy about soy sauce and sea food taste like me. although a little bit to the salty side.
Malay fried chicken. one more pack to go too lol
Lychee Freezy, very fruity taste."}
{"text":"Really, really, really good roti. Ever since I tried this place, I've been trying to find a restaurant in Boston with equally good Malaysian food, and I've yet to find it! The service could be a little better, but honestly the taste of the food speaks for itself. This is definitely a great restaurant to try Malaysian food for the first time. The only other thing is that it's cash only, which I would not have been ready for if my date hadn't been so prepared ahead of time."}
{"text":"Wow this was amazing. The food was delicious, curry chicken with roti is to die for! So are the noodles (the flat ones with shrimp). Satay is great quality. We ordered so much food, wings and also stuffed roti. Beautiful place we will be back. In love"}
{"text":"Amazing Malay and Thai food - loved the beef sambal and Nasi goreng - and their hot sauce is the bomb!!"}
{"text":"Just read the not recommended reviews and I'm sorry to hear that from all of you. I've been here more than 8 times and each time was as good as the first. Their foods are just spectacular and flavourful. I always get the curry and roti + curry chicken and rice. Food is unmatched in this area, though a little bit pricey for an Asian restaurant. I'd much prefer a bowl of Pho across the street, but once in a while is fine!

-1 star for price, otherwise A+!"}
{"text":"Finally made the trek up north to Major Mack after hearing amazing things from my foodie friends some just driving from DT just to grab food from Restoran Malaysia.

I ordered take out 1 order of Roti (2) and Curry Beef and 1 order of Pineapple Fried rice (Yes I was hungry).  The pineapple fried rice was delicious and I bet ordering it sit down style is even better.  The rice was sweet, tangy, and wasn't oily.  The roti came with a chewy na'an dough which had a slight sweet taste to it to balance out the beef curry heat.  I was a little bit disappointed that the curry was riddled with shard of beef bone but aside from that it was delicious.

Overall great food, delicious.  FYI this is a CASH ONLY kinda place so your plastic is no good here."}
{"text":"I have been this place three times. Every single time was a very pleasant experience. Service was nice, food was excellent. Beef curry with Roti, fired rice, pad Thai, satay are the must have dishes. 
I didn't like Malay fried chicken because it was overcooked so super dry. It was hard to chew without sauce. Pulled iced tea was nice too. During my most recent visit there, my 3 yr old told me the place stunk. I did notice the place needed some serious clean up. The dimmed lights can't really hide the stickiness. Hope the owner would take that more seriously. Clean and bright place would definitely help the business."}
{"text":"The place is noted as kid friendly but the service people were insensitive to the needs of a kid and parents.  

A friend was having a party at the restaurant, and though it was a party of 8 including a baby on highchair.. we were given a table of 6.  I guess the service staff just didn't think that a baby requires a seat too?  In any case, we did bring our own fisher price booster chair as usual... and had put her on the boothside against a wall.  Since she took up a seat, we requested an extra chair for the adult to sit on... 

The service person took a look at us.. and denied our request and told us that the baby can be put to the middle.. and the adult squeeze to the side along the bench.  So, with our big jackets and all, we had 5 people along the bench of 3 tables, plus jackets on the end.. it's no wonder that the lady next to us, very quickly requested a switch of table.. Their plain rejection at this simple request also brought a sour taste to begin with.  

Next came another insensitive staff... 

Knowing that the restaurant serves mostly spicy food, like curry, or food with contamination of nuts.. since the kitchen serves peanut.. , we brought our only food with us... which just happened to be hotdog.  The waiter saw us taking out food for the baby and immediately said, no outside food... and then added no pork... because it's a halal restaurant.... We tried to get the staff to make an exception this time around because it's for the baby, but it was clear that the waiter showed no empathy... and with a party group, we didn't want to make our friends feel uncomfortable either.. 

But with this experience, I can only imagine what their reaction will be with a breastfeeding baby or a bottle feeding baby... 

Sure the food was tasty.. but with the above said experience and the fact that the waiters gave no words of apology for the inconvenience  and showed a lack of understanding in tone and empathy.. and gave no suggestion on what would be suitable for my baby on the menu... well.. I'm certain I'll not be coming to this restaurant again and will certainly ell my friends that this restaurant is not kid or baby friendly.  In fact, it's pretty clear the staff that were there that night had no children of their own. .. because yes, it'll be messy with a child, so please don't give such looks of contempt when you see a messier than usual table when you do clean ups."}
{"text":"Eating here right now. Food has always been good but I missed it when they use to have their location at market village. Quality was much better I felt. But still a good place to eat if you like Malaysian food. We ordered a whole bunch of stuff (see photos added) and I can't even remember the names of my orders except for the coconut curry chicken with roti and my Malaysian-Cooler drink which consists of orange/pineapple/coconut milk so delicious. Service has always been OK here but the people who serve never seem happy or don't have smiles on their face. Maybe they are tired.  If you want flavorful foods packed with different tastes and spiciness/sweetness then this place is great to enjoy it's dishes. Prices are between $10-20 per dish and drinks are around $4-6."}
{"text":"When it comes to malaysian food in the GTA, only two restaurants come to mind as 5 star establishments. One2 Snacks in Scarborough and Restoran Malaysia in Richmond Hill. They've set the bar extremely high. Both joints are family-run.

Back in the day, I was a regular at this place because I went to high school across the street. The quality has NEVER dropped and the service is ALWAYS top notch. The food is prepared with halal methods so you will see a very multicultural clientele. Well, all those years in high school, up until the present and I realized I'd still never written a review for this place...UNTIL NOW hehe.

So I recently came as a group of 6 with some friends on a friday night. As we were seated and our friendly server came around, I recognized him from my high school days. He came by often to check on us and refill water.

MASAK LEMAK HIJAU (spicy green curry): The green curry here will blow your mind. Spicy, flavor bombs for days. The spiciness is not raging but rather, builds with each successive bite. So you feel the heat build very slowly as you continue eating. You get to choose what protein you want in your curry. We chose shrimp. Ample, ample number of jumbo shrimps running through the curry. The entree's don't come with carbs so you have to order them on the side. We added a plate of roti to mop up that delicious curry. In my roti-eating experience, there's two types of roti out there. Stretchy, chewy roti and flaky, crispy roti. While both textures are pleasant, they serve the stretchy, chewy sort at this restaurant (just a heads up).

PAD THAI: One of the best bang for your buck dishes here and something I always ordered in high school. They do a really proper pad thai. I believe the chef uses tamarind and chili paste as the main sauce base with maybe a touch of ketchup (or none at all??). I've been to other places that use a straight full ketchup base for their pad thai and it's not nearly as good.

NASI AYAM MELAYU (roasted chicken w/ rice): Tender roasted chicken served with rice thats been cooked in chicken broth. It came with extra broth on the side and some chili sauce. The chili sauce was powerful. Holy. One dip is all you need for each piece of chicken. The rice was not dry which was awesome.

NASI GORING (indonesian fried rice): Definitely the \"best bang for your buck\" rice dish at the restaurant. Packed with chicken, shrimp and veggies and topped off with a fried egg and some in-house shrimp chips. We were dipping dem chips in the green curry. Mmmmm.

NASI GORING NELAYAN (curried seafood fried rice): Basically the nasi goring but with a large assortment of seafood, tomatoes, bell peppers and the rice was of course, cooked in mild yellow curry. This was also yummy but I will say that the dish could've done without the tomatoes (I didn't think the bitterness of the tomatoes contrasted the flavors of the rice that well).   

SINGAPORE LAKSA: Okay, in the battle of the laksas I declare One2 Snacks as having the best laksa in the GTA but this place delivers a damn near perfect effort tbh. You get that savory richness from both but imo the flavor profiles are slightly different. You taste more coconut milk layered into the broth at Restoran Malaysia and more curry in the broth at One2 Snacks so it might be just a matter of having a different palette. If you like a bit more sweetness in your broth you might like Restoran Malaysia's laksa more. If you prefer more robustness and umami you would prolly lean toward One2 Snack's laksa like me. Either way, insanely legit laksa at both places.

PULLED MALAY KOPI (hot) & PULLED TEH TARIK (cold): my friend got kopi (coffee) and I got teh (tea). Should've gone with the coffee. It was WAYYY BETTER and way more complex. The pulled tea tasted like a really sweet milk tea. 

As an aside, lemme just say, the best SATAY I've ever put in my mouth so far was from here. However, the pricing on these babies is absolutely ridiculous and would make you faint (~$20/order of satay). So if you feel like splurging, get some satay as an appetizer lol.

Menu variety (in comparison to One2 Snacks): Really extensive menu and tons of items to choose from compared to One2 Snacks which focuses on less than 10 entrees.

Ambience (in comparison to One2 Snacks): It's quite a big restaurant compared to One2 Snacks (which seats literally 8 and majority of orders are take-out). If you really want a sit down experience this is the spot.

Pricing (in comparison to One2 Snacks): In terms of pricing, One2 Snacks is king. Their items are all under $10. Be prepared to spend min $15 here (or more than $20 if ur a big eater like me)

Overall, the quality of the food and service here is incredible. Have lived in Richmond Hill for 20+ yrs and still a repeat customer. I've never had the chance to try the desserts because I'm always stuffed so my future reviews will hopefully sample dessert(s).

Note*: Cash only and they do not take reservations"}
{"text":"Wasn't aware of this until I tried Malay Thai in FMP and read the comparison of the foods with this place. I wanted pad thai again so I came to give it a try.

Ordered dark meat chicken roti, pad thai and pineapple fried rice.

Curry taste of the roti was nice, flavorful and aromatic, but I prefer my curry with more kick.

Presentation of both the pad thai and the fried rice looked really nice. Pad thai got the colors of deliciousness. However, once in my mouth, I was disappointed. It was bland. It looked good and the texture was good, but there was not much taste to it. Same story with the pineapple fried rice.

Service and decor was nice. Too bad the food wasn't very tasty. I had higher expectations for this place after seeing all the positive reviews. But my meal was disappointing.


I don't live close by and don't think I'll be going out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times. The food and flavours aren't mind blowing. I do looovvee their shrimp chips though. It has a spicy taste and crispy without being oily. 
The nasi goring and fried rice are flavourful. 
My biggest issue, the place is halal (that's not the problem) but you can't bring outside food. Which is understandable, but that includes baby food!!! Even if you tell them it's a veggie mush or anything like that. Nope. 
So if you have a baby/toddler just going on solids, either feed them prior or don't bother coming cause your kid will starve. 
The service is ok. Cash only cause their machine is pretty much always broken."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. You gotta try the Malaysian cold tea. It's kind of like a thai iced tea but stronger amazing. However the food is okay.. the Roti is good. I've had the pad thai with chicken and shrimp and the chicken is very fatty. Not so lean. It's cash only so that's a bit inconvenient for a lot of people. I mean who carries cash all the time nowadays? It's been like that for a while. Make sure you come with cash! Oh and they're closed Mondays! Bummer"}
{"text":"Have had Malaysian a couple times as friend's homes and restaurants. There was one dish I really liked and inspired me to try to replicate at home.  It was a medley of seafood and chicken in saucy flat rice noodle.  Perched on tops is a raw egg yolk.  Simple rustic and yummy.  The tumeric fried chicken is very good too.  I'm not a fan of malaysian curries... but that just a matter of taste.  

I'd eat here again if someone asked me to go to a malaysian place... have not been back since the renovations..."}
{"text":"I had no idea what Malaysia's food was, now I know, i am feel lucky for finding this place. Excellent food and very affordable lunch menu. Friendly staff. Go there you will love it."}
{"text":"Leaning towards a 3.5 here but overall enjoyed my experience here.  Cash only? I've been reading reviews that it's been a long time issue here that the debit and credit is out of order. 

Staff are mostly friendly. One server was rough around the edges and the other was extremely polite. 

The mutton curry with roti is the stand out! Highly recommend it. The eggplant and shrimp was ok. The Indonesian fried rice twas pretty good, seemed like regular fried to me and I've had it in Indonesia (much better). The green chicken curry was pretty spicy and pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"The busier this place gets the worse the food becomes.
Again i encountered really salty and over cooked curry, appetizer calamari and Medan chicken. I'm never going back. Some restaurants just take for granted the number of customers coming thru and quality of food suffers greatly. The beef in the wide noodles tasted bad, almost sour, surprised I didn't get sick from it.
Adios Restoran.
."}
{"text":"Restoran Malaysia is a pretty big restaurant, but it was still packed both times I came here - on a weekday too! I'd say their food tastes above-average and their prices are great for the amount of food you get.

DRINKS: My friend ordered the Malaysian Cooler, and the combination of OJ + pineapple juice + coconut milk is extremely refreshing. I got the Mango Lychee Freezy, and it's more viscous (like a smoothie). The lychee flavour is much stronger than the mango, but it tastes amazing overall and not overly sweet.

FOOD: Pad Thai portion is HUGE! For $10, it comes with both chicken and a generous amount of shrimp as well. The noodles are really chewy, and they use just right amount of sweet tangy sauce to give it enough flavour. 

We also tried the Shrimp Paste Fried Chicken. We chose it over the other 2 types of fried chicken because the waiter said there would be a touch of seafood/shrimp taste to the fried chicken as well, and that sounded quite interesting. HOWEVER... Did not taste even a hint of shrimp; it was just like regular fried chicken, but still delicious and super crunchy. 

The Roti and Curry Chicken was amazing! The home made roti was nice and light, and heavenly when dipped into the curry. It wasn't too greasy either. The chicken was tender. I can't handle a lot of spice though, and this dish was a lot spicier than I anticipated. 

Side note: There were so many flies flying around us during our meal. It may have been because of our sweet drinks, but one landed on the lychee that came with my drink and started devouring it for a good 5 minutes. :( I was not impressed. 

Aside from the flies, I was happy with the food and I can't stop thinking about the drink. Will definitely be back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Pricey for what it is.  I read some reviews before going.  The Roti very good though the proportions are tiny!   
We looked at other tables and saw many Nasi goreng so maybe that's the dish we should had ordered.  
We had the Roit and the Kuey Teow (noodle dish)...the noodle dish was nothing special.  Tasted like abit like a chinese rice noodle dish.  My friend, who is Malaysian said it was not good...so my tastebuds were right...nothing to be impressed with. 
Okra dish...my friend thought it was undercooked so it was at least fresh okra and not frozen..so that was a plus...but I wouldn't make a special trip for this...maybe to try the nasi goreng everyone else had on the table...but that's about it."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Malaysian restaurant in the GTA. They make some great dishes, such as green curry, red curr chicken, laksa noodles soup, pineapple fried rice. Even the kebab appetizers are delicious.

Their rice and noodle dish portions are huuuge for the price so you'll probably need a doggy bag.

One point deducted for CASH only. Not cool."}
{"text":"My first time coming here! And it was very enjoyable!

-although it was busy we got seats right away
-staff was welcoming, friendly and very helpful
-food came quickly & reasonably priced
 
We ordered:
- roti & lamb curry 
-pad thai 
- seafood fried rice TRY THIS(lots of seafood and tastes delish)
-coconut chicken curry (smelled and tasted really good)
Satay chicken & beef (taste wasn't as strong)

Overall everything tasted very good and authentic. It was a very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"This place used to be really good back in the day. Now, the service sucks, and the food is mediocre - the flavours just aren't the same. I have really high expectations for Thai food, as it's one of my favourites. The tom yum gong was really disappointing and, for the last two years, it has tasted different every time."}
{"text":"The roti is excellent. Meat quality was high, spices were well-balanced, and portions were large. Restoran Malaysia knows its business.

A co-diner's Sweet and Sour Chicken that I sampled was a bit tough, is my one complaint, past the noise of the crowd. But they drew that crowd with some high quality cuisine."}
{"text":"I came for lunch with some friends and had a great experience (except finding a parking spot on a Sunday lunch rush).

I ordered the Singapore laksa noodles which is my favourite dish here. What's interesting about this dish it's that they give you an egg noodle and also a thin vermicelli noodle too (great texture). On this particular day, the soup is quite thick. I don't mind the thickness, but it was a little salty.

I took a bite of my friend's pad thai is it was really good. I wished I ordered both dishes for myself because they're both so good.

Another friend order red curry and nobody really liked it. Everyone but myself tried it; I didn't want to because everyone's face had an unappetizing facial expression after trying it.

This establishment accept CASH ONLY. 

I've been lucky enough to have the same nice server everytime, but I forgot his name. He is always smiling and he always asks of we have a food allergy which is such a great thing to consider. 

I come here a lot and I would recommend this to all my friends."}
{"text":"This place is SUPER BUSY.  Make reservations if you can of expect to have a long wait.  There was a non stop flow of people.

Huge selection on the menu many choices.  I ordered the beef and chicken skewers to start and sweet and sour beer served in a pineapple and an order of Pad Thai for our main course.  Huge portions great for sharing.  Very Tasty.

Whenever im in the Richmond Hill area again I will be sure to visit it again"}
{"text":"Ok pricy but i like the food, it's a bit of Indian/pakistani flavor to the food. meaning it's curry type... I personally love it, but you have to know what you are ordering, if you don't make sure you ask the waiter and they explain to you, cuz some of the dishes sound nice, but are unflavored and waste of money
wait time is a disappointment, and too crowded and noisy"}
{"text":"I always come here for the Singapore chicken rice.  The chicken were boneless and the dipping sauce was great!"}
{"text":"Yay! I got to wait with everyone else in the Club scene that was the Lobby waiting space near the seats and bar.  I didn't know any of the others waiting but it felt like I was at a Yelp Elite event and wanted to walk through and start mingling especially those Ladies at the bar.

Teh Tarik($4.00) was the first item I ordered while I was sitting down and started to look at the Menu.  FROTHY smooth creamy lightly sweetened Milk Tea.  Four dollars is about 3x more costly than HK style Milk Tea but this was my treat and without being price conscious, it's awesome!  Every Starbucks or Tim Hortons should have this.  (+0.5 *Star*)

Roti(2) & Curry Sauce($6.00) had decent Curry Sauce flavours but the spiciness was quick tame.  We found the Roti had a sweetness to it?!?  It came out unexpectedly rapid as well so maybe the Roti was prepped ahead.

Nasi Lemak Melaka($12.00) looked interesting but the Rendang Beef and Sambal Ikan Bilis lacked flavour specifically Spice once again.  The flavour from the whole composition came from the Peanuts and Vegetable Achar.

Singapore Laksa Meehoon($10.00) had Fish Cake Slice, Tofu, Shredded Chicken but once again it lacked Spice from their description of Spicy Laksa Broth(Shrimp Paste).  By now we figure we should call all Curries here Mellow Yellow.

Malay Kari Beef($11.00) had an intermediate spiciness only because it's inbetween the Laksa(Least) and the Curry Sauce(Most) above.  Beef was tender but when they say Potatoes, what they really meant was singular Potato.

Black Rice Pudding($5.00) was so anti-climatic coming out in a simple bowl without any exotic presentation.  Chinese Dessert places would do the same style and it tasted good to end the meal however I just wish they presented it more suitable to the class of this place.

Service was quite nice and the space/atmosphere is nothing you would expect from just driving pass this place as it is quite Westernized thought-out designed which suits the multiple Ethnics and Canadians that enjoy this place.

As a Food first, Decor second person, I now understand why Gourmet Garden has such a reputable place for Malaysian Cuisine.  I'll still come here if Friends ask.  Teh Tarik(Pulled Tea) will bring me back."}
{"text":"This is my go to place in richmond hill for quality Asian food. Their lunch menu is very reasonably priced, and staff are so nice and friendly!

The pad thai and pineapple rice are my favourites. 

NOTE: They accept cash only."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner with my daughter and she said something is not sitting right and literally vomited in the parking lot! Will not come back again"}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for a decade and this restaurant was the prime spot for Thai food in north Richmond Hill/Markham. However, on my last visit I have noticed that the quality in their food has gone down. I feel as if their food is now comparable to Spring Rolls (and all Thai food lovers know, that restaurant is on the bottom of the list). I hope this was just an isolated incident :("}
{"text":"Great family style restaurant in the York region area. The reason for rating it 3 stars is because I enjoy only some of  the dishes. Recently I came here and started with the appetizer platter. This allows you to try most of their appetizers. It came with satay chicken and beef skewers, fish cakes, spring rolls with a plum and peanut sauce. I liked the skewers and fish cakes, the plum and peanut sauce complimented the dish quite well. For mains I had the pad Thai, Penang char kuay teow and Singapore laksa. I found the pad Thai really bland and would not order again. However, the Penang was great, very savoury and rich in flavour. As for the laksa, I would also not order it again because the broth was so rich and thick  the noodles absorbed the soup. I had to ask for more soup when I saw the dish and it was quite spicy as well. The drinks were not bad, would recommend to get the freezes (lychee freeze was good!)."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place recently. The restaurant was bigger than I expected and had a nice atmosphere to it. They have generous portions and fair prices for their food. I got the roti with beef curry and chilli chicken curry for two. Both were tasty! I especially liked the beef curry. The chilli chicken was a bit too spicy for me even though it only had 1 spicy symbol, so I wouldn't recommend it for those of you who can't handle a bit of spices. We weren't able to finish the chilli chicken either, so we packed it to go and ate it a few hours later and it still tasted great!"}
{"text":"It's very authentic Malaysian Food.  The decorations is very Southern Asia.  When you walk in, you feel cool during hot summer day.  

The service is good, portion is good.  Curry is ok.  Cash only, no credit cards."}
{"text":"I held my birthday party this year (2014) for a party of 15 people so we were able to try a lot of their dishes. I ordered the most expensive food on their menu - both the crab and the lobster. The food is good and the taste is authentic although a bit pricey. The favorites by our guests from the party were the Curry Lamb & Roti, the Nasi Goreng (Indo-Malaysian chicken fried rice), and the Singaporean Chili Crab.  

The only constructive critique I can say about this restaurant is that they do not allow reservations even if a big party is trying to book ahead. I hope that they change this policy, as it can be a turn-off for future guests. However overall, a great place to eat with a very nice casual ambiance."}
{"text":"Love this place.

TBH, I'm not a fan of spicy foods or curry, however this restaurant makes me love both items. The flavours are unique and different, love their coconut base items,  the portions are decent and the variety is great. 

Favourite entrees:
Singapore Laksa  
Yellow Curry with chicken
Pineapple sweet and sour with shrimp 

And for the finale (dessert): Roti Pisang - soo good."}
{"text":"OMG great food! Malaysian cuisine should be the next Thai cuisine - whatever that means. 

Roti Canai and curry chicken = damn. i've been searching for this dish ever since i've moved here from nyc and man o man have i found it. 

Staff is really friendly!
Atmosphere is very nice.

note: Halal so that's good for people who only eat halal stuff."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Really enjoyed the currie roti nice depth of flavor. Overall I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great authentic malaysian restaurant, other than Gourmet Malaysia at Brimley and Sheppard.

I went on Father's day, and for 4 people, 4 dishes costed about $50. They do not take reservations.

Beautiful traditional decor. Servers are very friendly and will gladly assist your accommodations. They also ask if you have any food allergies.

We had:
-Beef Murtabak: surprisingly a little bland, we had to dip it in our curries
-Penang Char Kuay Teow- flavourful and extremely soft! unlike other places where the noodles are thick and chewy
-Beef Rendang Minangkabau: this is one of the best dishes; the beef is melt-in-your mouth tender, and sauce melded with flavours of shallots, lemon, and turmeric
-bowl of coconut rice
-Singapore Laksa: rich and spicy, I don't eat spicy, but when something is this good with coconut, I'll eat it. The chicken is lemon-grass flavoured

We didn't have dessert, but we tried the Kuih Ketayap (crepe) the last time we came, and it was a little too sweet for our taste; they could go without the syrup. We noticed that mango smoothies are a popular order.

Forgot to take pictures because we were starvinggg. We became thirsty a couple of hours after the meal, but we would come again because it was amazing food!  :)"}
{"text":"Coming across a Malaysian restaurant is a pretty hard find, let alone one that is actually good.

Since being first introduced to Malaysian cuisine from Edison, New Jersey's Penang in 2002, I've been on this fruitless search for really amazing Malaysian cuisine that really knocks my socks off and ALAS, my search has finally ended.

Every time I eat there, I always leave feeling absolutely content and satisfied with my meal.

There is an array of dishes there that you obviously can't get to all at once, so every visit back, you can always change up the usual order and try something different.  I'm the kind of girl though that likes to stick to the usual favorites. What can I say, I know what I like and I stick with it. My husband on the other hand is of the more daring sort, so he'll order something we've never tried before.

The Roti Canal, the fried chicken, garlic okra, and Pad Thai are always part of our standard order. I just can't go to Restoran Malaysia and not have any of these make it to our table. 

This \"Restoran\" is definitely an absolute favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Nice family atmosphere. Service was decent, food was okay. Great prices on the lunch menu! I had the Penang char kuay teow, which was good but actually had less flavour than its appearance indicated. Maybe I'm just used to fast food high in sodium/ MSG, so this might be a good thing? I would still come back and try more dishes (they seem to specialize in curries)"}
{"text":"Often come here for lunch on weekends and grab one of their lunch specials (of which there are many). 

Pad thai, chicken curry, mee goreng are all solid, but nothing special.  Portions are a decent size.  Service is typical of Richmond Hill.  Quick, efficient, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

It's a very safe, stable choice for malaysian, thai food.  

One good thing about the resto is that it has lots of big tables for large groups!"}
{"text":"The decor in this restaurant is nice and modern with a huge fish tank with some interesting fish in it.  The wait staff is friendly and prompt.  The food is wonderful as well!  We really like the chicken curry with roti.  The roti is sweet and yummy.  There's enough curry to order more roti or rice to go with it.  We also like the chow kuay teow (basically fried flat rice noodles with shrimp, egg, and sausage).  It tastes even better with the curry sauce on it.  Other favourites include the satay skewers, eggplant with minced chicken, garlic chinese broccoli, and pineapple fried rice.  For drinks the mango lychee freeze and hot milk tea are amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh the memories. Until I came last week, my most recent visit to Restoran Malaysia was like 10 years ago. We celebrated my grandfather's birthday then. I still remember having the Gado-Gado from that visit. 

We came for lunch last Wednesday. There were a surprising number of people here, but in a good way. Service was good. Heads up, tea is $0.50/person, I think... We ordered 3 lunch specials and the Gado-Gado (appetizer). The waitress asked if we wanted to do the dinner portions for an additional $2 each because those were larger. We declined. I'm glad we did, because each of the lunch portions was very large. If those are only lunch portions, I can only imagine how large the dinner portions are.

The Gado-Gado is almost like a slaw of jicama, cucumber, bean sprouts and perhaps other things, and sliced hard boiled eggs covered in the most delicious sweet peanut sauce. This is served with a side of shrimp chips. I greatly appreciate them serving the shrimp chips on the side so they wouldn't get soggy. Also a good portion for $7. Definitely shareable among the 4 of us. 

The Pad Thai ($8), while tasty, was not particularly unique (not that it should have been or had to be). I liked how it was served with lime wedges and orange slices though.

The Hainanese Chicken Rice ($7.50) was boneless. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The rice was yellow. This is important. Hainanese Chicken Rice is supposed to have rice flavored with chicken drippings. Many places get this wrong. Restoran Malyasia got it right. It was also served with chicken soup, ginger and green onion sauce, and a spicy sweet sauce.

The Nasi Goreng ($8) was a chicken and shrimp fried rice with what I'm guessing was shrimp/crab paste, topped with a fried egg and served with a few shrimp chips. There was a good amount of chicken, shrimp, and veggies in the rice. The shrimp in this and in the Pad Thai were not dinky little shrimps. These were surprisingly nice shrimps. I think this was Grandpa's favorite dish. Quite flavorful, this one.

If I lived closer, I'd be here all the time for lunch."}
{"text":"The red curry and penang curry was delicious.  However their Tom Yun soup was a bit too salty."}
{"text":"I've been here twice before and it didn't really impress me, I was actually disappointed as the decor was nice and the food looked authentic. My previous visits I ordered mostly \"dry\" items such as the appetizers or pad thai. 

This time I decided to go all curry and my experience was way better! I got the curry beef with roti which tasted very fresh and roti was just warm enough. As well as we got Tom Yum soup which was very good as well. In my opinion I would go for curries only here. 

This place does get busy so for large groups I would definitely suggest calling ahead."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and honestly, the food is ok, but not spectacular for Malaysian, Thai or Chinese.   Both times the chicken in different dishes I ordered was on the dry side.  I've honestly had better food in nearby restaurants that offered the similar fare.  

As for service, the first time it was meh, second time it was slightly better.  This might be due to the high volume of customers, so I don't mind that so much.  What I don't like is having to ask for a refill of water 3 times from the same person.  

I'll go again if my friends want to go, but pretty much not if it's my own choice."}
{"text":"Love this place!!

I've been here many times over the years, but went back on Saturday for a birthday lunch with some friends :)

The layout was just like the last time we were there..

It's all familiar in there. Love it. 

We had:

1. The Beef and Chicken Satay - Mmmm. The beef wins over the chicken here. So tender. So grill-y. So freaking delicious. The peanut sauce was a bit too sweet. But it was made with for real real peanuts and for real real malay flaire!! 5 stars just for this.

2. Basil Beef: Delicious as well. Not spicy at all for those of you who are pussies! Slices of beef, onions, baby corn, bak choy, beautiful.

3. Hot N' Spicy Sambal with Chicken: I had to get it. I couldn't only eat non spicy food at a malaysian restaurant! It was phenomz. Thick thick  spicy chili paste curry. Mmmmmmmmmm. Dreaming about it right now. Heat me up baby?

4. Nasi Goering: LOVE IT. Penultimate fried rice. You can't go wrong. Shrimp Chips on the side? Yes. Though, this is the only place I've had it where the egg is placed full cooked...usually I've had my Nasi with a runny egg and yolk dripping everywhere.

5. Pineapple Fried Rice: It was okay. But keep in mind that I freakin' hate pineapple in my food. It's a fruit guys. Fruits are not savoury. Mmmkay? But it looked beautiful! They scooped out a pinapple and filled it with the fried rice!

6. Pad Thai - MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. A bit too sweet, but still good.

{"text":"3.5 stars, it could be better but they have little kinks that did not make my 4star category. We went as a large group and got a myriad of dishes.  It was my second time trying Malaysian food and first and third times where I got it at a hole in a wall restaurant tasted better than this place.
Nevertheless, I would return here to try again.

Food: 3.5/5, the fried chicken was the best part of the night and others like nasi goreng, which I was most excited about came flat for me.

Service: 3/5, not as attentive for a large group but better than usual asian places ignoring you after they bring the food lol.

Ambience: 4/5, fancy and great seating and atmosphere overall. It is a great place for dinner conversation in a circular table.

Price: 2/5, it was not as expensive - typical around $10 per dish but they only take cash which is never good in my books."}

It is probably the only place I have been to that has had a crazy mix of orientals, Muslims and Caucasians eating Malaysian and Thai food

Nasi Remak Melaka is the reason I come here but the reviews suggest a hit or miss approach.

if you are unsure of what you are ordering then ask so you wont get a surprise of like i did 

\"well we must have ordered boiled chicken because that is what it looks like and that is what they brought\"

i love the curried fish dishes which are a specialty in Malaysia"}
{"text":"The restaurant is much more than it appears from outside. Nice interior design with ample seating space. The food is good, but I was not very pleased with their service. So, I gave it two stars."}
{"text":"Good, solid Malaysian/Indonesian food! Happy to have found this place, and another reason to come to the GTA. :)

While this place isn't exactly cheap eats, we were on vacation, and they serve up some great satisfying comfort food. Husband and I went a little crazy with the ordering because we just wanted to sample everything. Great leftovers though! :)

This is what we got:

- Fried Fish Cakes (appetizer, $9 for 4 pieces): Similar to Teo Chew style fish cakes, these were individual fish cake \"patties\". Good texture without being too chewy, but the plum sauce was meh for me.

- Roti Canai with Mutton Curry (appetizer, $10 for 2 pieces): As good as we've found outside of Singapore! The texture of the roti wasn't thick and crispy, but chewy. Very nice. Mutton was of good quality and had decent amount, but would have liked it be either in smaller cubes or shredded to facilitate the wrapping. Great curry flavor though, on the sweeter side.

- Nasi Goreng (entree, $10): A mixture of chicken, beef, shrimp, vegetables, and A WHOLE FRIED EGG ON TOP(!!!!), this fried rice was probably our favorite of the evening. Reminiscent of our favorite fried rice in Indonesia, this really came close. The key difference being that the rice was cooked in chicken broth really transcended the flavors of this dish. The subtle curry undertones added to this wondrous taste. Portion was very generous and provided leftovers for days.
 
- Chinese Broccoli Stir-Fry with Garlic ($10): Nothing special, but the vegetables were fresh. It was oddly plated in that it was served in a bowl? lol Did they run out of plates? It was a little odd, but not a big deal.

- Kue Ketayap (Coconut Crepe dessert, $6): Good flavor, but the texture and consistency wasn't what we expected. From the pictures, it looked like it was more of a sponge cake (which we were excited to see), but alas, it was a true crepe. The coconut filling was spot on.

- Teh Tarik (Indian style black tea with condensed milk, pulled with evaporated milk, $4 for hot, $5 for cold): Tasty tasty, but portion small. Make sure you sip it slowly! Not overly sweet and the froth was perfect.

Service good and quick, and the ladies are really hard working. Washroom facilities are bit cramped, but clean. The overall morale is upbeat and the manager who hand pulls the tea always had a smile on his face.

We ended up taking a bunch of leftovers home, and had the in-laws sample it. They gave a big thumbs up (super picky too!), so this place is totally worth coming back to! Next time, I'll probably pass on the fish cakes and coconut crepe, but that fried rice and roti? Totally gotta get it! :)"}
{"text":"I got the singapore chicken rice, roti canai with chicken curry and the roti pisang.

I'm always searching for \"back home\" food and was SUPER excited to find this gem.  With such a high rating on YELP, I was waiting in anticipation for work to finish on my business trip to Ontario.

I was SO disappointed!!!  The chicken for the chicken rice was tough, the rice was flavorless.  The only authentic thing about the dish was the chili/ginger sauce!  I couldn't even finish half of the dish, it was so terrible.

Next I read that they made their own roti canai.  Having tried and fail at making this at home, I was excited to see how they fared.

First of all, their roti was NOT thin enough, therefore the layers and flakiness was not there.  It was thick, doughy and didn't even have a crunch to it.  The roti pisang was TOO SALTY and not at all delectable.

I've realized yelp reviews from the Toronto area are totally NOT reliable as have gone to many \"high rated\" places and have had nothing but disappointment.

This is the WORST Malaysian restaurant I've EVER been to in my entire life across the country and am shocked at how \"authentic\" people claim it is."}
{"text":"My only question to this restaurant is \"why has your credit card machine been broken down for a gazillion years?\" It's clear that they don't want to use it anymore because of taxable fees, but don't give people the hope of ever paying with their card again by claiming it's an 'inconvenient broken down machine'. Cash only, boo boos. I actually enjoy how big this restaurant is. The decor is definitely Malaysian style. It's cute. 

The service here is a little rushed, as if they want to rush you to your seat, stuff you with carb-packed malay food and then rush you out. Sometimes the food comes out quickly while other dishes take so long that you wonder if they've forgotten about it.

The food is a tad above average, except for the Tom yum soup- that tasted way weird and off. Not tom yum at all. It was a bit bland too. The rice dishes and curry dishes are tasty and I wouldn't mind eating them now and then. 

I don't come here often because I'm not at the level of adult where I have cash on me all the time. They would have so much more business if their card machine wasn't 'broken'. Haha."}
{"text":"I came to Restoran Malaysia expecting average tasting food, however, I was blown away by wonderful flavors that had my taste buds screaming for more. I brought my sisters and mom here and although we all have different taste in food, we all agreed that the food was absolutely delicious. 

We ordered the mango milkshakes (wonderfully creamy with the perfect amount of sweetness), the nasi ayam melayu (roast chicken with the rice and soup), the black pepper beef kuay teow (noodles), the chicken Malay Kari and a couple of bowls of rice (coconut and rice with soup). We had plenty of food leftover even after overeating (we were a party of 4). My favorite was the sauce the roast chicken comes with (chilli, ginger and garlic). 

For dessert, we ordered the fried banana with icecream and the coconut milk pudding topped with fresh mangos. 

With tax and tip, the bill came to $90 and was worth every penny. FYI the restaurant takes cash only. 


Our server was a very pleasant man whose smile was contagious and whose service was excellent. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is THE best for Malaysian curry. They have different kinds but the best one to get is called the 'Malay curry' which is a yellow curry with a great taste. 

The beef and chicken satay skewers are wonderfully yummy and come paired with a peanut sauce so sorry to those allergic to peanuts but this place is definitely a big negative for you guys. 

The pad thai is one of the best ones I've ever had. And the rice that comes in a pineapple (can't remember the name at this point), is really good! I came here with a friend and we ate approximately $80 worth of food which is A LOT and we both were stuffed beyond belief and took a whole container home with us. For all you environmental peeps like me, their containers are reusable and microwave friendly at no extra cost!

Decor has improved since I first went and now has a dark, modern look to it. It is quite dimly lit inside and if you have a hard time reading then get someone with good eyesight because this place will test them."}
{"text":"Pros: 

- Thai pineapple fried rice was delicious and very filling.

- Affordable prices. Everything on the lunch menu was less than $10. 

- For an Asian restaurant, our waiter was very accommodating. He was constantly checking on us and asked if there was anything that he could do for us, something that I really appreciated. 

Cons:

- Didn't really love where we were seated. We were seated between the entrance and the bathrooms - not exactly the best place to sit when you're trying to enjoy your lunch."}
{"text":"It's a bit outside of my radius to come here regularly, but when I am in the areas it's hard not to have this place at the top of my list.  

Very friendly service and the food is great.  I realized this is the kind of place where you look at the next table and wonder if you should have ordered that dish instead, but it's just more reason to come back. 

The Freezy drinks are very good.  Most dishes will serve 3 easily, so definitely something to think about when ordering.  Only knock is it's cash only, but the gas station next door has a bank machine."}
{"text":"Any food with Belachan sauce tastes awesome! Kids love the spicy okra with Belachan. Pineapple rice felt a bit on the bland side. Green curry fish was quite spicy but if you are used to Indian food then this is tolerable. Service is good as they have sufficient servers esp during busy lunch rush when we were there. 

Plaza parking can be a bit small."}
{"text":"This is my go to Malay Resto, lunch special is always my favourite and I love the Singapore Chicken and Char kway teow is unbelievably delicious but portion a little tad small occasionally."}
{"text":"Deceptively small looking from the outside, Restoran Malaysia is really massive inside.  I stopped in for lunch with an associate who recommended the place.  The variety of dishes is incredible, and I had trouble deciding.  The staff is eager to accommodate your preferred level of spice, which is always a good thing.

Between the delicious Basil Shrimp lunch special, a red bean shake and the coconut rice desert, I left stuffed.  But not after admiring the dishes passing me on their way to other diners.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good, prices reasonable it is only cash so be mindful of that. It's gets busy. I have only been twice, i would say it's not my kind of personal preference but my husband liked it. If you are into Malaysian food then you will love it"}
{"text":"Awesome Malaysian restaurant located in richmond hill. Food is big portion and reasonable priced. The restaurant is clean and never disappoint me. Have brought my family and girlfriend there, and they all love it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"after having read so many good reviews on this restaurant i decided to give this one a go..
so i was somewhat feeling curry that day so i decided to get the chicken curry with the roti and my mom got the chicken rice dish which was recommended by the waitress. i also decided to try the evaporated milk tea drink.

so first things first, the curry roti was alright. it tasted pretty standard to me.. nothing really stood out. the evaporated tea was alright too.. it was quite interesting but i thought it tasted pretty bitter which is a no bueno for me 

my mom let me tried her chicken dish and THAT was actually pretty damn good LOOOL however, I don't know if it's on purpose but the chicken tasted kind of cold. i would've preferred it to be at least a bit warm. would've made it taste bombtastic! but yeah"}
{"text":"We are a long time fan of Restoran Malaysia - indeed, since so many years ago the before they changed to cash only business. This is one of those good food, good price family restaurant that has unique yet reliable flavour. 

In a recent visit, to our horror, price in this establishment has gone way up. To give you an idea, party of three - order of one appetizer, three mains, three non alcoholic drinks will run you well over $90!!! My God, this is at least 30% more expensive than what the price was not so long ago. For a Richmond Hill restaurant, this is definitely becoming an expensive restaurant and not in keeping with nearby restaurants.

Restoran Malaysia probably felt that they can increase price with no change to their business even after instituting cash only business few years back. They do take their customer loyalty for granted. Well, I hope they are right, but I personally won't be coming back to this now overpriced restaurant anytime soon.

At the least - if they are trying to become an expensive restaurant, they should bring back the credit card option and improve food quality / menu offerings."}
{"text":"My wife and I started going to this restaurant before they relocated to current unit. Was a small but yet very friendly cozy place back then and food was top notch you could feel the passion while they strive for advancement. After many years now we go with our kids, food quality gone down drastically, and passion disappeared particularly new staff. We ordered grilled calamari, pineapple fry rice, yellow curry beef, and Singapore chicken rice. The server rest assured except for yellow curry, everything else is suitable for small children. First came the Calamari, I cut a small piece and gave it to my 4 yr old girl.  She started crying and screaming, barely mentioned 'pciy, pciy'! (She means spicy). Should be impossible but when I tried it was in fact extremely spicy. Turn out when either the chef or server carry the plate to our table they accidentally spill the hot sauce from side plate onto the main plate. We asked for a replacement politely, but was told by the server 'well maybe the kids can eat from remaining orders'. With absolutely no regret. Obviously the 4 yr old was too afraid to try anything else. Besides the rest of the orders were all below expecting, beef is hard like rock, chicken was dry and rough, rice tasteless and soggy,  the pineapple in the fry rice were bit stinky. Before we left I explained to the owner (lady behind cash) on what has happened and that we are disappointed on how their service and food quality has gone down, being a loyal long term customer we just wish to share feedback so she could look into it. Her response was that she doesn't hear anything similar and restaurant is always packed which backs their quality and service. OK boss am sure plenty of the other more authentic Malaysia restaurant would welcome us. For food quality alone, the small Malaysia store in First Markham Place food court taste much better in my view yet lot more friendly? and cheaper."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and there isn't much Malaysian food places in GTA. This one is pretty good.

This time I had the chicken roti. It's pretty good starter. The roti was soft, hot and quite tasty even on it's own.

Normally I wouldn't order the Wat Tan Ho, cause I've had this quite a few times at other places and to me it's not traditional Malaysia. But sore throat made me stay away from too many spicy things. But I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. There was seafood in there, in a super large plate, it was really \"wat\" (smooth), courtesy the egg.

Was a bit disappointed after repeating the order, our second dish of beef rendang was missed. Even after they realized their mistake, it took a bit to get it. And when it came, what a disappointment. The beef was big, chewy and not very good. I would not neat this here again.

I'd still come back cause in general it was good. The previous time had Hokkien noodles and I really like eating that.

This place is super busy though, have to always wait for a table I feel.

So after missing our order, I was hoping for some discount or freebie. Guess that was hoping for too much. Got neither. Guess don't expect it when it's not yours."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a RH gem, for sure, but I don't know that I'd drive out of the way to make a trip here. While the dinner service is great, the food just wasn't 'it' as much as the other reviews suggest. I've had Malaysian before, and Restoran Malaysia, seems to be more of a Western-Thai fusion suited to South Asian palates rather than authentic Malaysian. 

We had the green mango salad. While it was satisfactory, the mango was fully ripe and sweet and was sliced overly thinly. The green curry with vegetables and it was definitely not spicy enough. 

The egg prata, be warned is more of a crepe then a roti, and sweetened. 

The drinks were just satisfactory. I had the ovaltine milk and tried the tea. Both were made of condensed milk. I wish I was pre-warned."}
{"text":"my go to restaurant, been coming here since they were a small little corner family business. always dropping by for a teh terik. my go to dishes are the nasi goring fried rice and the thai basil minced chicken. never a disappointment. when i come for a sit down meal, i ALWAYS get their roti and curry cause i know the roti will be fresh and delicious, made to order. if you haven't tried this friendly family restaurant, you need to go now! but they are closed Mondays."}
{"text":"Great food:
Mutton curry
Roti Canai
Beef skewers
Shrimp chips 

Service can be hit or miss 

Cons:
Cash only"}
{"text":"There is so much truth to that age old adage;  \"Never judge a book by its cover.\"  Restoran Malaysia, as you can see by so many of the previous reviewers, is that sort of book cover.  It is innocuous and in a million years you'd never guess what was behind those doors.  I especially liked the Budda belly just inside the front door.  He just whispers to me....come rub me.   :)  How can a girl resist?   When we first arrived we sat at the bar and watched them make this unbelievable tea  that is \"stretched\".  It is a show on its own.  The guy behind the bar poured a couple of glasses for us and said \"here on the house!\".    

After reading the rave reviews here on Yelp we decided to take our out of town friends who were in town visiting, over to Restoran Malaysia.  They absolutely loved it and so did we.  I would arm wrestle Hulk Hogan for a plate full of those beef satays!  We ordered a myriad of things, everyone picked dishes that appealed and then it was just like a food free for all.  We started with the mixed appetizer platter (satays, both beef & chicken, fish cakes, spring rolls and some other crunchy thing).  I have to say I could just eat the peanut sauce as a food group itself.  We ordered some roti with curry sauce and some mango salad.  That is what we started with.  

Mains included Red Curry Chicken, Rendang Beef (love the lemongrass!), Garlic Green Beans, Mamak Mee Goring (thick noodles....oh Jay, we loved this!), Pineapple Fried Rice and some Pappadums.  It was all delicious and plentiful.   Leftovers were packed up in some super duper takeout containers and as I write this review my daughter is busy chowing down on the leftovers.  

So what's the downside of Restoran Malaysia.  No liquor license would be the very first thing that comes to mind.  They do, however, have the biggest non alcoholic drink menu I've ever seen with some pretty unusual beverage concoctions.  I had a Mango & Lychee freezie, let the slurping begin.  If you are looking for a quiet spot for dinner then RM is not for you.  This place is packed with people and the crowds never let up the whole time we were there.  Of course with such a busy spot and the kitchen churning out the food, the temperature in the room was warm.  The waitress apologized a couple of times and she kept bringing us more ice water.  If she hadn't of said anything I would have just assumed I was having a mid-life hot flash.  I didn't mind though because the food was really wonderful.  

The total price tag for dinner for four, with taxes, was $115.00, which we all felt was a bargain.  We will most definitely head back to RM when we are jones'in for a fix of Malaysian & Thai.  To my fellow Yelpers in the heart of the city, I have some advice for you, go north younger Yelpers, go north!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty decent (though I admit I don't have anything to compare it against). The service can sometimes be poor and the wait onerous (especially since you can't make reservations and it gets extremely busy during meal times). But damn those Mango Freezies are just too awesome. In the heat of summer, you just want to chugg like 3 of these and then take a 4th one for the road."}
{"text":"After a fun and exhausting day of swimming and inebriation, my friend took me to this place where we had a feast. It was some green curry with squid, muscles, shrimp etc. Then some fish with yellow curry. Some mutton with red curry. The pad thai and one other dish which I can't seem to remember the name of. Have a lychee freezie with that and the day honestly feels complete. That meal hit every note I needed it to and I walked out of there really pleased with getting everything right that day from the activities I did during the day to the fabulous meal which just topped it all off. Definitely go to this place and order liberally. Order their juices along with the food and it really feels like for a moment like the authentic experience. thanks to my Malaysian buddy who took me there! Definitely a place to take family, friends, guests and business colleagues."}
{"text":"Cash only.  And I love it!  The flavours are out of this world.  I wish they were more descriptive if their items.  Love their roti!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place!!! Malaysian food is bomb. It's like a mix of Caribbean and Indian....great stuff!!! 

We didn't have to wait a long time at all which I hear is rare for dinner? There was a couple or two in front of us. 

Ordered appetizer platter - the beef satay skewers were TO DIE FOR!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! 

Roti was thin and soft and gooey and chewey mmmmmmmmmnomnomnom :) I like this much more than Indian style roti for suuure. 

The noodles are great too, service is stellar - couldn't ask for a better experience!"}
{"text":"I really don't get the appeal of this place. I had the pad thai, if was ketchup basedz disgusting. I had the curry with roti and it was watered down and mildly flavored . the roti is whatever , you can't really mess up making bread. to top it off , this place is cash only which makes the whole experience even worse. lucky for me I ain't planning to return ever again"}
{"text":"Authentic, big, amazing flavours!

Prices are VERY reasonable for the portions, and service is friendly :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants to get Kway Teow. I love southeast Asian noodles and this is my top spot to satisfy that craving. It may be busy on the weekend but the service is always quick. 

I like their curry with roti and Kway Teow a lot. Their noodle and rice dishes are quite big. The prices are reasonable. Highly recommend coming this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this restaurant and having a great meal. The restaurant is nice and the food is almost always delicious. It can be a little pricey based on the portion size but delicious none the less. 

The one thing I don't like about this restaurant is that you can't have a drink with dinner! No alcohol is served, which to me is a little unfortunate."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, the fried rice and green curry is amazing. It is 5 stars for sure but I gave it 4 star because it only takes cash."}

{"text":"Always great food, roti, pad thai. Can't go wrong here ,although it's definitely not cheap."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here.  Halal certificate is on display. Very good food with excellent customer service in a classy atmosphere.  We tried the Beef Randang (very good), Yellow Curry with Chicken (good but i like the Thai version better), Shrimp Curry with Pineapple (very good), the Tom Kah Gai Soup (lemon grass soup with chicken - which was excellent) and the Roti (very good).  Also had the Teh Tarik Hot Tea (tea with condensed milk). Very fast and friendly service and very attentive waiters.  Nicely decorated interior.  Prices are a little on the high side, but this is the type of restaurant you go to on special occasions, so it is worth it.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A beautiful not so hidden gem within the Richmond Hill Community.  This place has been there since ages ago and when I mean ages I mean it probably pre-dates back to when I was a high school kid.  An old favorite as well as continually to be one of the best restaurants to go to within the york region for Malaysian food.  

In terms of dishes, I love their wat tan ho which is pretty much an egg based sauce that is lathered on the noodle as well as their hainan chicken rice which is by far the best place I have ever had the dish anywhere within Toronto.  The only place I would say I had better is where the dish was domiciled in Asia.  

Mom loves the dish Singapore Laksa and can never have enough of that dish and pretty much is an expected dish to get everytime we do go and visit the place.  It is one of the best restaurants hands down within the York Region and is a must go for anyone in the area.  Their durian milkshake is also a must try for those adventurous enough to try the fruit that smells from miles away, but trust me it is so worth.   

Overall, a place that you really can not go wrong with waitresses and waiters that are thoughtful as well as food that is impeccable."}
{"text":"I went here once. Decent food, nice facility.

Service was disappointing. When one of the waitresses saw that our group under-ripped, she informed us in a passive-aggressive tone that we have not tipped enough. It's a mistake for us to not have tipped enough, but we would not expect such unprofessional behaviour from a restaurant like this.

Wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Best Malaysian food in Toronto! Only have had slightly better Malaysian food in HK. Their curry dishes are awesome. I would also recommend the indonesian fried rice- very tasty! 
I love the decor of this place- very modern and chic."}
{"text":"Consistently good quality over the years! It's my go to place for malay/thai/singapore food. 
They have the best laksa in town. It's just not worth getting a laksa anywhere else. 

Everytime I am feeling a little adventurous to try a new menu item, I am not disappointed. But my go-to is usually pad thai, laksa, satay, roti and indonesian fried rice."}
{"text":"Really like this restaurant, just wish it wasn't so far! Been here a couple times already and the food is consistently good. Their roti and fried fish cakes are delicious. The food cannot compare to malaysia but it's the best we can get in the city. The staff is friendly. The wait can be quite long tho!"}

The Decor of the restaurant is nice as well."}

Food: pretty good; not out of the world. like to go there during lunch time. roti (2 pieces) is good but it's kinda pricey for the portion. Like the chow kwai dew. Guava coconut drink is nice.

Environment: pretty good but almost every time there will be a line which can take anywhere between 10 15 mins to half hour."}

Full Review:
We arrived at the restaurant during the cold winter night. We received our table quickly. First impressions of the décor is amazing and service was friendly. After spending some time looking at the menu, we ordered Pad Thai, Mee Goreng, chicken and beef satay skewers, roti and curry chicken. I was cheap and ordered ice water. Update 6:45pm

The beef and chicken skewers arrived with a peanut sauce and cucumbers on the side. They tasted amazing!! The peanut sauce complements the skewers perfectly (chicken is my favorite). The roti with the curry sauce tasted delicious. This surprised me because I am not a huge fan of roti. The Singapore Laksa had too much coconut flavour in the soup (will vary according to taste preferences). 

The Pad Thai and Mee Goreng arrived. The Pad Thai was cooked amazing. The shrimp and the noodles had lots of flavor. The Mee Goreng was a bit bland for me and was disappointing. However, my brother said it tasted good with enough 'wok hei'.

Looking at the dessert menu, I decided to get the mango rice pudding. It arrived a few minutes later. It fresh mango flavor and conconut tasted amazing together. It had a great balance of sweetness.

The service was helpful all night during my dining experience. They were attentive and ready to respond when we needed them.

Ristoran Malaysia exceeded my expectations. The food tasted awesome and the dessert finished it off amazingly. Thanks Kris U. (http://krisu.yelp.ca/) for the helpful suggestion and the Yelp Main page for guiding me to know about the restaurant. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who is craving Malaysian food. The five stars were well earned."}
{"text":"Decent food and fairly large portions, but a bit on the pricier side. I came with some friends and ordered the Mixed Mutton/Chicken Satays, Roti and Curry Mutton, Belacan Water Glory, Pad Thai and Singapore Laksa. I appreciate their big, bold flavours, and the spiciness level was tolerable (I usually can't handle too much spice). Side note, the waitress taking our order was incredibly knowledgable and helpful when selecting our dishes,  so don't be afraid to ask questions!

Now on to the food!
Mixed Mutton/Chicken Satays: The meat was dry, but was ok when covered in their peanut dipping sauce. The sauce itself was very flavourful, with little chunks of peanut in it. It was a bit awkward trying to dip the skewer into the tiny bowl without resorting to double dipping. Use a spoon to add the sauce.

Roti and Curry Mutton: The curry mutton was delicious! The lamb was tender and pretty much melted in your mouth. Curry sauce was pretty standard, but the lamb was definitely the star. The waitress recommended we order more roti, as we were four people, but the dish only came with two rotis. Problem was that with four rotis, we didn't quite have enough curry to go around.

Belacan Water Glory: I've had water glory before, but never with belacan. I had to google belacan, and turns out it's a shrimp paste, which explains the strong umami flavour to the dish. They added some spice to give it a kick, making it a pretty nice vegetable (though not vegetarian) dish.

Pad Thai: Pretty standard pad thai. Nothing too notable.

Singapore Laksa: We originally wanted to order the Penang Assam Laksa, but our waitress said that was quite sour and recommended we try the Singapore Laksa instead so we did.  At first glance, it can look intimidating because the soup base is quite orange, but it's not that spicy at all. The noodles were soft and chewy, and the bean sprouts added a nice crunch. The broth was very flavourful which is nice because the rest of the contents were quite bland (noodles, bean sprouts, tofu, chicken, fish cakes, etc). I didn't like how much oil was in it though. You can see the little pools of oil floating at the surface of the broth, which can be a turn off.

Note: Cash only, so come prepared.

It's a nice place to come with friends, as the seating is quite spacious and the ambience isn't too noisy. The lighting is on the dark side, which can be tricky if you want to take nice photos... All in all, it's an ok place, and I would probably come again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night with nine guests. We waited approximately 1/2 hour for a table as they do not take reservations. Perhaps they will in the future as it would be really helpful for large groups. They do have tables that accommodate large groups though. When we arrived at 7:30pm, the restaurant was very crowded and there was a great hustle and bustle in the restaurant. The food was delicious. We ordered satay skewers,  seafood fried rice,  samba fish, some sort of fried chicken with shrimp crackers,  chicken curry, egg plant,  stir fried beans,  roti and much more. The food was delicious - everything was seasoned well and everyone left feeling full! The service was prompt and friendly. Their shakes,  Malaysian tea and desserts were also yummy. I ordered their sago with coconut milk,  not too sweet and having it served warm created a great contrast between the sago and milk. Another important note to remember is that they only accept cash. A sign at the door should probably be posted for this. I hope they consider other forms of payment one day as there are no banks near by and I am not sure if they have an ATM located inside. Food wise,  it was great and the crowds show for that!"}
{"text":"This place is awsome. The service is excellent. I love bring friends and family here because it's better to share all the delious dishes. My favorite has to be the ox tail soup."}
{"text":"Another one of our top 3 or so for Richmond Hill. Great eat in or take out. I like the decor in their restaurant and the fresh fruit drinks they blend up at the bar. Eat in or take out, I will always get the Indonesian Nasi Goreng. Very large size full of good amount of nice size shrimp and chicken, and I love the fried egg on top. Beef Rendang also a favorite - lots of beef. Nice roti."}
{"text":"Loved everything I tried here. It's a little out of the way and hard to find parking, but definitely a must-try! This place is usually full on any given day.

The laksas, curry and rotis, pineapple fried rice, wat dan ho were all done very well each time I've been there. Sometimes the wait is a bit long if you don't have a reservation but it's good for couples or groups!

The dessert there is also very good - we had the banana fritters and mango sticky rice which our group enjoyed immensely. 

The price is a little higher than regular asian restaurants, but worth it. Waiters are relatively friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I joined some friends for dinner after work but they started without me. Darn them! That meant that my camera didn't get to eat, hence no pictures and I don't know the names of the dishes that I ate. Regardless, everything tasted good!

I had crispy fried chicken, another chicken dish in some kind of red curry coconut sauce, fried rice in a pineapple, noodles, and more. I wish I knew the names of what to order next time.

Note to self: choose better friends next time. ;)"}
{"text":"Great food at very reasonable prices. It gets pretty busy during dinner time so be prepared to wait a bit.  Definitely worth the wait though. Roti with curry is always a favorite, their last was also tasty"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with a friend for dinner to catch up.  I usually don't eat Malaysian food, but I was definitely craving it.

My friend and I ordered the pad thai and the nasi lemak melaka.  This time, the waitress that we had asked us if we wanted the roti pisang (a great favourite of mine) as the appetizer or the dessert.  This was a great surprise, because last time we had the roti pisang as the appetizer, and it was a little strange to have the sweet food before our actual dishes.

Anyhow, the pad thai was absolutely amazing.  I think it might be one of the best pad thais I've had in ages.  Most places just taste liek ketchup mixed in with noodles.  The nasi lemak lemaka is a very simple dish, with coconut rice in the middle served with sambal ikan bilis, rendang beef, boiled egg, sliced cucumber, toasted peanuts and vegetable achar.  It was a bit too spicy for my  liking, but I absolutely loved it.

The service was really good too.  The waitress always came by with a great smile on her face and was very kind!

One of my favourite restaurants in the GTA!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night and had to wait 20 mins for a table for 8. We ordered a bunch of dishes, but these were my favourite:

- Beef satay
- Beef curry with Roti (very good)
- Indonesian fried rice 
- Crispy noodles with chicken and shrimp (this isn't on the menu, but it's very good)

Portion sizes are about 3 people per dish. 

And as everyone else has said, this place is cash only."}
{"text":"We went there last week. Quite pricey for some menu but those medan fried chicken was delicious. Can't find it anymore expect at indonesia. Don't order gado-gado coz i wasn't please with the taste and i'm sure that is so not called gado2. It was runny peanut sauce with lack of flavour. Other stir fry noodle and fried rice was good but just as the same as other malaysian stir fry restaurant.  So if u want to eat some southeast asian food, do your research for menu coz not all the menu worth the price and taste."}
{"text":"Big place. Great ambience. Amazing food. Great service. Key things most of the people look for in a restaurant. Their portion sizes have increased since the last time I went and is pretty decent. The green curry chicken, mango salad, parathas, fried rice, Thai coconut soup, grilled pineapple is all spot on. Full of flavour. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"First time here, food is fine but a little pricey for some dishes. Portion for the mango salad appetizer was not enough, pad thai was good but noodles were a little too al dente for my family. The coconut curry fish was underseasoned, could've used more salt. Overall it was a good experience, servers were friendly. WIll come back again to try their drinks and desserts."}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant, I was delighted by the decor. The restaurant has an awesome atmosphere and the servers are quite friendly and helpful. 

The food is delicious. They have the right combination of spice and hotness (taste). The service was unexpectedly fast and the portions are impressive; they do not cheap out on the meat. 

This restaurant is a great addition for people on Halal diet. 

I would only comment negatively on their \"only cash\" policy. I am not sure if it's permanent or their system was down but I saw a lot of signs that gave me an impression of this being permanent."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! terrible parking though - small and not a lot of spots, but there's a big mall  with parking across the street. Prices are reasonable.

Ordered 4 dishes to share. Portion sizes were decent. Quality of the food was very good and flavours were deep and rich. 
1. Roti with curry beef - comes with 2 roti. Got it more as an appetizer. Its pretty small - came with 5 pieces of beef. But Cooked well and was delicious. Beef was tender.
2. penang gulai nonya - Fish filet - its a good combo of tomato and chili. The okra and eggplant are nice touches. Fish was soft and tasty.
3. Belacan green bean with shrimp - standard dish. Shrimp were kind of on the small side. Just got it for the sake of having a vegetable dish. Nothing special. Cooked well and good option if you just want more veggies.
4. Indonesian fried rice/nasi goring - egg on top, big portion size and comes with shrimp chips

Got a mango lychee feeezy which is basically a slushy. Its delicious and not fake tasting. My friend got the lychee freezy which was basically the same minus the mango. I preferred mine because I love mangoes.

Overall great place to go. Waiters are nice and fast. Place is clean and dishes are great. Took off a star for the terrible parking,  otherwise highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Decor, good, service all great. When we went there was no credit or debit options. Other then that it was a good experience. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I adore this gem in Richmond Hill. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. Last night myself, my husband, and a friend ate here and had such an amazing experience. We started with the appetizer platter - all delicious except for the fish cakes - strange texture. Otherwise loved the satay and spring rolls. I ordered the sambal shrimp with coconut rice - amazingly tasty but definitely hot so if you aren't a chili-head I would avoid it. My friend ordered the green curry with beef and it was amazing! Soooooo yummy! Hubby ordered sweet and sour beef - wow- definitely the best sweet and sour dish I have ever eaten and fantastic presentation in a hollowed out pineapple quarter. Awesome stuff but this restaurant is constantly busy because of its amazing food so be aware of the need to make reservations if possible. I have so many more dishes I want to try! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I know they won a few awards but their food is not that great. Its a bit pricey and the portions are very small. One bowl of meat (rice bowl size) I would give Koodos to their interior decor as it's pretty new and nice."}
{"text":"The food here is quite good. Sometimes a bit of a wait since it is popular and in a small plaza. The only thing I wish they would change is to take debit or credit, I have to remember to bring cash any time I want to eat here.

I would stay away from the rice dishes but the curries are very rich with lots of flavour, definitely a must try if you are in the area. And if they are too busy, just hop on over to Bayview kitchen, not the same food but in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Delicious and great atmosphere

{"text":"Used to eat here monthly (2008-2013) with a friend from Singapore but for various reasons I haven't dined here since late 2015 although I've stopped by a few times for a take-out snack Murtabak.  Other than the inconvenience factor, my enthusiasm was also curbed by what I perceived to be a gradual trend away from spiciness every couple of years and the noodle disheses seeming to shrink.

Well last weekend I was back, and for this night at least, so was the spiciness - at least with the Roti Canai appetizer and the Laksa. For the Roti I went with the Beef Curry and as always it was a very refined and sophisticated brown curry in which more flavour develops with each bite, and while not super hot, it had enough kick to wake up & sensitize the palette. The Rotis were more stretched out and crispy than before - I gather in response to some reviews who mentioned this - personally I rather liked the slightly chewier & doughy Rotis as they had before but whatever.  The grilled Calamari appetizer was about as tender and enjoyable as possible. Mango Salad maybe a bit too much dressing for my taste this time around but still good. 

Laksa had good kick to it, just as in the old days. But this time it was considerably thicker and with much more noodles & seafood slices. If this is how they serve it now, it's a real stand-alone meal, Fortunately there was two of us so we still had room for the Hokkien Mee which as usual was nice balance of sweet & savory with an appealing amount of smoky aroma left over from the wok.   

This evening reminded me that RM is a friend I want to visit more often. The kitchen doesn't always hit the spot with every item like they did on this night, but I've never had a meal I was sorry to order here.  

My advice to people coming here is to stick mostly with like the Roti Canai, Murtabak. Chicken Rice, Hokkien Mee/Mee Goreng, Singapore Laksa, , Beef Reedang, Nais Lemak & Noya Maleka Curry. Don't wast time or money on stuff you could just as easily get in a Thai Restaurant (Red Curry, Pad Thai) ."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The roti here is fresh and very scrumptious when you take a bite into it. You really can't go wrong with any dish. Just expect a lot of flavors from each dish."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Have tried quite a few Malay food joints but this one stands out. Place was very busy on a Saturday lunch time but food arrived surprisingly fast. Kicked off with some mixed chicken and mutton Satay skewers and some fruit mocktails. The roti with mutton curry and the Malay curry were awesome. Ordered some more to take out for dinner too!! Good friendly folks.  Definitely worth a few more visits (although it's about 40 miles from home)!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times over the years and the food has not changed.
It has stayed consistently good and the food is adequately affordable.

I am a big fan of the roti, yellow curry, pineapple chicken (served in the shell of a pineapple!)  and their noodles, mamak mee goreng (tangy and zesty) and penang char kway (greasy fat noodles, definitely comfort food) accompanied with a cold refreshing lychee mango slushie. 

Only complaint is that their menus need a revamp, theyre falling apart! Also, their chicken wings are served without sauce, so if youre a big fan of sauce-covered wings, this would be a slight disappointment. Their shrimp chips as a side is not that great either, kind of stale and frankly its boring.

Overall, its a great place to go for authentic malaysian food, good service, amazing atmosphere (loving their dim lighting) and an affordable bill. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great yellow curry, grilled calamari, naan and nasi goreng. Beef rendang was disappointing. Service was really good.No liquor license. Really busy...waited about 20 minutes at 7 on Sat night."}
{"text":"Restoran Malaysia is a popular Malaysian restaurant which has been around for a long time.  I've been here a few times, the food is excellent especially the milk tea which they do very well here.  

I've tried several dishes and they were always prepared nicely.  It's a bit expensive though for the amount of food you get so if you're a big eater you might be disappointed.  Because it's popular it can sometimes get pretty busy.  I remember during peak hours on a weekend when we had to wait 40 min for a seat.  Parking is ok, and service is good."}
{"text":"It was a trip down the memory lane as I visited Restoran Malaysia in more than 4 -5 years.  This was a go-to lunch spot for my colleagues and I when I used to work around Leslie/16th.  They used to serve up excellent lunch specials both in quality and quantity.  The food was always consistent and service, just as courteous.  

I happened to be in the area with my sister who had never tried the restaurant so we decided to pop in for a quick lunch.  Since we got there a little early, the usual lunch crowd hadn't packed in yet.  But the first thing that greeted us was a sign on their main entry saying, \"cash only.\"  Really?  Hmm....  This was not good.  At least in my books, when a restaurant starts accepting cash payments only, there's something going on there.  

Despite my growing reservation, we sat down and ordered Gado Gado, Singaporean laksa and a curry ayam to share along with a warm soy milk and a fruit shake.  

The Gado Gado arrived with a gigantic mound of shrimp chips (made in house, I'm guessing) that were just great.  Perfectly crunchy and perfectly savoury.  Sitting prettily under the yummy chips were sliced cucumber, jicama, bean sprouts and boiled eggs (slices) all topped with generous serving of mashed peanut sauce.  I enjoyed the salad but felt like there was something missing though.  Some heat from a chili, perhaps?

The generously portioned out miki noodles came in a square bowl topped with shredded chicken, fish cakes and other veggies bathing in a rich, spicy coconut broth that was perfect for such a chilly early winter day.  The laksa packed a nice heat and the broth, although rich, hit the spot perfectly.  

The ayam curry looked ok but the chicken breast pieces looked dry to me.  I didn't get to try the curry as I was trying to finish my gigantic bowl of noodles.  

To finish our meal, we opted to share Kek lapis and this was probably the worst part of our meal.  The \"thousand layer cake\" was flavorless, dry and just not good.  They served us four small squares of the cake and we left 2 on the plate.  

I would say our experience today was not as good as I remember the restaurant from previous visits.  Considering I now live some distance away, I doubt I'd go out of my way to eat here.  Who knows?  Maybe next time, I can ask my Indonesian mother-in-law to accompany me for some honest reviews of their dishes."}
{"text":"Always a great eat.  My go to dishes are (in order of awesomeness):

- Wan Tan Ho (make sure to eat it with the little pickled chilis)
- ayam goreng
- Char Kway Teow
- Chicken Rice
- roti pratha

While they have take out, I find that this place in particular, is orders of magnitude better dining in."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Another coworker recommended this resto to try as hubby and I are in for an adventure. We are glad to visit this place for our happy meal."}
{"text":"Tried a variety of things here and overall everything tasted okay but nothing really stood out.

Guava coconut and Pomegranate Lychee drinks at $5 each - more like an exotic fruit slushie but tasted pretty good.

Chicken/beef satay at $13 for 6 pieces - the peanut sauce it came with was amazing but the size of the skewers could have used an upgrade.

Chicken roti for $8.50 and $2 for each additional flat bread - really small portion but very tasty and still pretty good value for the $8.50. I still thought the sauce was missing a little something. Maybe a little spiciness would have given it some extra kick.

Pad Thai for $8 - nice decent size shrimps. The sauce had a sweet flavor to it and once again dish is on the smaller size but good value for $8.

Pineapple fried rice for $7.50 - more of the same once again. 

Mango pudding $6 - the mango was an actual mango and not the pudding I was expecting and it was a really sour mango. Don't recommend.

Sago dessert $5 - don't know what to say about this one but I really didn't like this dessert either and do not recommend. 

Coconut rice pudding $5 - loved the sweet coconut shavings. My favorite dessert of all the ones I tried. 

Overall a nice meal but nothing exciting here that makes me want to come back."}
{"text":"This would be a 4.5 star review.

We are regulars here.  Husband always orders rendang chicken, coconut rice, rotis and curry sauce as well as a ginger tea.  I love the rendang beef, pad thai, meesiam nonya style (current fav!)
Great, friendly service.  Often a long lineup on weekends, but the line diminishes quickly.  Food arrives quickly after ordering.  Reasonable prices as well.
Only qualm I would have is that its been 'cash only' for almost two years now.  Otherwise, a fav weekend dinner spot."}
{"text":"I visited this place 2 years ago and the foods were great and I feel disappointed today lunch. The quality of food going down hill. Also, they do not accept credit card with such a nice deco restaurant as well. I was planning to bring colleagues over 15 or 20 ppl but I need to pay cash approximately few hundred bucks. Any party or gathering   Not a great place to go.
Chief has room to improve for their foods. I found out not many customers anymore compared couple years ago. Not recommended places!"}
{"text":"Beef Curry and Roti was delicious. Chicken curry was good. They were accepting only cash when I visited; so do carry enough cash."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times but recently went back.  I ordered the chicken fried spring rolls as a small appetizer.  Fresh crispy and light flavourful!  Next I had the Pineapple shrimp curry.  This was amazing and ordered some roti shells to eat it with!  Also to wash it down was a mango-lychee freeze.  There are so many amazing items on the menu and service is always very good!  Definitely the place to come for Malay food in R Hill!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I have never been disappointed. I usually have one of the delicious curries with a roti or 3. If I get rice it's usually the nasi goreng garnished with shrimp chips. For lunch I have had their roti and chicken curry combo which is just enough food for lunch. If you are unsure of what to order just ask the staff for recommendations and tell them your preferred spice level. Quick service and great food."}
{"text":"I came back the other day and I must say that I had a more positive, different experience.  I had some different things this time: 

1. Satay chicken & beef: I honestly think that this was better than the lamb.  Both were quite tender and of course, their sauce is perfected to a T. 

2. Chicken, beef, & lamb roti: All were great this time.  They did miss out again on our chicken roti order.  If I were to choose b/w the three, I would say beef & lamb are my favourite in these dishes. 

3. Indonesian fried rice: My mother ordered non-spicy.  Would have been SO much better if it was spicy.  Thus, I cannot give a real review of this yet...will go back and eat the REAL version.  

4. Fried sea bass: Delicious!  We had garlic sauce over it...and it was so good!  If you aren't scared of eating fish with the bone in, definitely try this dish!  You won't be disappointed. 

5. Pad Thai: Regular pad thai - I have yet to taste a really really really good one though. 

6. Sago pearl dessert: I wish they just used coconut sauce...b/c the caramel makes it way too overpoweringly sweet.  

7. Coconut crepes: Bland...if you like coconut shreds, then you may like this dish but it wasn't super.  

overall, their service was much better this time and I had a more enjoyable experience.  I think I just ordered more traditional dishes this time and I was able to be more adventurous this time without a bunch of squeamish girls who wouldn't eat anything other than chicken.  Back to 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"I would rate them five if they took credit cards. Regardless, they still get busy.

My favourite is the very spicy green fish curry with roti. Mango salad helps to cool things down."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Eh, it's gone a bit downhill since the last time I visited (about 2 years ago), but this is one of the only true Malaysian restaurants out there, so there's not really much in the way of other options.

Yesterday was my 5th or so time I've been here since I moved to Markham in 2002. I remembered the first time I visited here I marveled on how wonderful the skewers were in here, but unfortunately the ones I got yesterday were too burnt (especially the beef). They were also quite tough compared to the skewers I had before in this restaurant. Maybe a change in servers, or a bad batch (since it was Easter after all)?

The pad thai, however, was excellent for $8. Sure it's not Sukho Thai/Khao San Road standards, but it's definitely above the average Thai fast food or non-authentic pad thais I have pretty much everywhere. Finally, the pineapple fried rice also tasted very good; it also had that coconut feel that's quite standard in Thai establishments. 

Service was a hit and miss. The position of our table made it difficult to wave down any server, and most of them simply overlooked us until we actually had to yell them to get their attention. When we managed to wave someone down though, it was taken promptly. However, the food in general came out quite slowly, and we didn't finish lunch until around 90 minutes after first order.

I'll definitely come back if I want that Malaysian cuisine feel, but I'm not too excited about this place anymore."}
{"text":"The restaurant is classic suburb. Big space, decent food mostly foreign staff.
My friends had fried rice and pad Thai, a real carb feast. They enjoyed it. My other mate had the green curry chicken. It was really hot but very good green curry i tried some myself. 
I enjoyed the veggie Malaysian curry. It was certainly decent although nothing special.
We went on Friday, there was a bit of a wait and parking in the main lot was sparse although it seems as if there are other lots around there. 
Not worth the drive from downtown but if you're in the area it's a safe bet for family or friends!
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Malaysian food, this is the place to go. From Hainanese Chicken Rice to Nasi Goring, it offers a wide variety of selections. Definitely the best place for Malaysian food in town."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been to Restoran.

Not because the food is not top notch. Not because the service isn't spectacular.  Not because there desserts are over the top.  This restaurant is all of these things.

I stayed away because I overdid it with their hottest dish and needed several years to recuperate.  True story.  ;)

I was told about restoran from a friend.  He ate there very frequently. So, I gave it try.

I was very impressed.  The restaurant is a Malaysian restaurant.  Malaysian food is similar in some ways to thai food, and other foods of the region that are nearby, but it is an country on islands, so there is a lot of seafood as well.

Mayalsian food is highly influenced by the Portuguese.  The food can be very spicy, so best to let them know your tolerance of heat.  Not all dishes are hot, but be careful of the angel fire dishes if you are not good with extreme heat.

I had the mutton curry, and I had a bowl of seafood soup.  Both were excellent, and the meat flaked under my fork.  Cooked to perfection in a delicious sauce that was accompanied by coriander.  This was a very delicious meal, and the soup was also excellent.

I also had a black rice pudding dish that was made of coconut milk and black rice.  Not too sweet and nice and creamy!

I also had the red bean with coconut milk ice shake that was very good.  I'm a sucker for red bean anything, so this was a beautiful compliment to a most excellent meal."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

I have been to this restaurant multiple times in the past several years, and they are, for the most part, quite consistent with their service and food quality.  I had stopped coming here for about a year at least because it was not convenient for me to travel there, but then just went back this weekend because I was craving it, and the food was the same!

I have tried several Malaysian restaurants in the GTA and this would be my favourite. I've tried the Malay fried chicken, pad Thai, Nasi Ayam Melayu, Indonesian fried rice, and their beef curry with roti. I've tried other dishes too, but the above are some of my favourites! All of the dishes are very flavourful. Their milk shakes/smoothies are rich and creamy too. It's a good complement to the spicier dishes.

The prices are reasonable and the amount of food is plentiful. The service was quite good the last few times I went. They were attentive and very quick with bringing out the dishes. My partner and I were in and out of the restaurant within 30 minutes I think (yeah, we ate fast lol). Although, the line-up for this place is quite long. We had to wait about 20 minutes, but it was well worth the wait. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations, so make sure you go early to put your name down!

I can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing Halal restaurant. I went on a Friday night and it was busy. They don't take reservations and only accept cash payments. I ordered the HOT AND SPICY SAMBAL with chicken. It has chili-lemon grass, shrimp paste, (belacan)-shallot-tomato-tamarind. If you want a spicy dish this is definitely it. Ordered with a side of coconut rice. Definitely will be going again !!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this restaurant like last year, but I just didn't have the time. I had good expectation about this restaurant because of the reviews. However, I was disappointed when I put the first spoon of pineapple fried rice into my mouth...........

On a Friday night, we had 8 people coming to this restaurant. The parking lot was super super super small, but lucky I found a parking right away after waiting for 2 min. Inside the restaurant, we weren't mind a pot of tea cost $2 each, but they shouldn't limit to only 4 cups. We asked for 2 more cups, and the waitress told us we will need to get another pot. However, glasses of water were free, so better get glasses of water instead. Also, the waitress didn't smile at all for the whole night. He looked like we had owed him money or something but it was our first time coming to your restaurant, maybe a little smile would help?

Our table ordered 2 appetizer platters to share. Me and my gf ordered a pineapple fried rice, a yellow curry chicken, and a side order of steam rice. There skews were pretty good with their special sauce. The meat were juicy enough and they were in the right bites size. However, the main course were quite disappointed. The pineapple fried rice was kind of bland. The color was there but just maybe the chef didn't season it enough. The shrimps in the fried rice were huge but they tasted like they just boiled them in last min and put it on the rice. If I said the fried rice was bland, the shrimps were super bland. Also, there were some bitterness to my fried rice. It only existed in some part of the rice and not the whole plate. I turned to my gf and tasted her curry and was hoping it would taste better but it was super watery, and the meat were dry and hard.

Anyways, I don't think I will come back here again because:
1. small parking
2. angry waitress
3. so so taste main dishes
4. cash only

I had different Malaysian food in Scarborough before, and this was the worst on the list. Maybe a true authentic Malaysian food does taste like Restoran Malaysia but I don't like it at all, especially with that bland-bitterness pineapple fried rice @.@"}
{"text":"Great value for money for some tasty Malaysian/Thai/Indonesian type food. Restaurant is spacious and usually pretty busy. Pricing is quite reasonable and although the food won't blow your mind away, it won't disappoint as well. 

Malaysian fried rice - top choice for me, this was packed with flavours and came in a generous portion

Fried chicken - seriously fried chicken, crispy, dry and nothing special - but id totally get it again

Curry with roti: definitely pick a curry and try it with the roti. Their roti is thin and tastes great with any curry"}
{"text":"Haven't had Malaysian food in a while but accidentally stumbled upon this yummy restaurant!  The roti with chicken curry is out of the world.  The coconut rice is one of a kind.  And dessert was very nice as well with palm sugar."}
{"text":"My most recent visit to Restoran Malaysia was a bit disappointing.  The washrooms were not clean.  Although the restaurant was relatively empty, they seated us (with two children) at the very back where it smelled like cleaning products.  I wonder if the floor had just been mopped.  Because we were with the children, we opted to stay or I would have left just because of the smell.

The food was delicious.  The service was incredibly slow and the server not helpful.  When I asked for if I could get some vegetables separate for the infant, she did not seem to comprehend the request.  No was the answer.  In the end, it did not matter since he gobbled up the vegetable curry that was served with their famous roti.  

My kids LOVED the food.  The prices were reasonable however the restaurant is now cash only.  

Given the size of the restaurant, I would expect they should take credit card. Not only that, the facility should be to a higher standard.  I think I will continue ordering the occasional take out from here but I will not visit in person for awhile."}
{"text":"I love going to this place for lunch. Their Mamak mee goreng is out of this world! Yammy :-)"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant that offers Malaysian Thai dishes.  Reservation is recommended fr party of 4 or more. They get pretty busy. Service was good both tines I went. Portion is small but good to share."}
{"text":"First impression.
I ordered roti canai, that don't turn up right. the bread was supposed to be thin, flaky and yummy. and the dipping (Curry) sauce supposed to be thicker and have taste.
this one is just bad. so I'm leery for the rest of my food.
Order rendang, they put too  much water in the rendang. it supposed to be dry and sweet and spicy with enough spices to spice it up. but no, it was bland, no taste.
then Chili crab. well, first they are supposed to crack the crab, so you can get the spices absorbed by the crab. and then the sauce.
apparently, the way they make it. they just boiled the crab as a whole, and then cut it into pieces and then throw in the sauce on top of it. (bah...)
if the sauce have flavor, then yes, it might taste ok. but still, they are just plain bad. (don't get me wrong, the crab was fresh, so it spoiled everything, because the sauce was bad).

ordered desert (black sticky rice - it was quite nice) and mango pudding. it wasn't a pudding. it was a mango with sticky rice (thai).

how they can fix these.
they need to reduce the amount of water the put into their cooking, then it will turn out right. (they still need to work on roti canai)
they have the right spices, but too much water, so the whole food has no taste."}
{"text":"Havent been to this place in years and I can say that it has gone downhill....quality kind of slipped, the pad thai tasted something similar to spring rolls, very sweet and tangy which it shouldn't be....we also go the yellow curry which tasted like Chinese curry that you could get in a HK café, portions are big and price for their lunch specials is not bad, like $9 each, but still quite disappointing and the curry chicken tasted like old chicken, dry and rigid"}
{"text":"Clean and friendly place. Upon entry, there is a big figurine that looks like molten wax, which looks creepy.  The tahrik is still good. Don't rely on the number of chilli's on the menu to judge the level of spice. I got burnt from tasting a side item of a one-chilli dish."}
{"text":"I'm a bit iffy about this place now. I was here for dinner two weeks ago with my girlfriends. I ordered Red Curry chicken with a bowl of rice. To my understanding Red Curry should have more of a tomato base and sweetness in it but it wasn't what I expected at all. 

First of all, it was a bit too spicy for the dish but luckily, I was still able to take it probably because it's still cream based. The level of spiciness is more like I'm having green curry. And secondly, I couldn't taste any tomatoes base inside which kind of defeats the purpose for getting Red Curry. 

I feel there weren't as many people eating at this restaurant anymore. I'm not sure is it because it's a Sunday evening but there is definitely more empty seats and less pack compare to the few times I been here previously. 

I'd probably come by again to try their other dishes just to see how's everything else's taste. As mentioned, I've had been here previously. In fact, I've tried few other dishes like green curry, pineapple fried rice and Malaysian rice before and it's pretty good and authentic. We'll see how it goes next time."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this restaurant for the past 10 years and always enjoyed the food quality and good service. The beef satay is always amazing! 
Over the past 2 years, however, the quality of food as deteriorated and the prices have increased significantly. The restaurant is no longer flexible with payment options. It's either cash or cash. In today's moneyless society the younger generation do not carry cash. This \"cash only\" policy has made going to Restoran Malaysia incredibly frustrating. 

I have been able to find newer restaurants that fit my budget and do not compromise on quality."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what Malaysian people eat, but if it's anything like what they serve at this restaurant then it's fantastic!  It's like a mix of Indian and Thai food, lots of curries, pad thai-like dishes, fried rice and roti.  Very exotic!

We ordered the pappadum, pineapple fried rice (served in a quarter pineapple) and one of the curry seafood dishes.  The portions were large and the flavour was complex and very delicious.  For all the food that we ate, the price was very reasonable and the service was excellent.

The feel of this place was very similar to the nice Congee places like Congee Queen, Congee Wong, etc.  The place was large and had long tables for group dinners.  I just wished they had something like this in Toronto."}
{"text":"Get: mango lychee freezee, curry beef + roti, pineapple fried rice, mee goring..."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with family. Ordered a few appetizers: mango salad and fish cakes. Fish cakes were pretty bland .... didn't have much of a fishy flavour or taste. The mango salad was done well. For the mains we ordered roti, some meat dishes, and some fried rice. I wasn't a fan of the fried rice, but other people liked it. The roti and the curries were quite good. The pricing here is a little higher than what you would pay at your typical strip mall chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Parking: Small lot, you may have to do a bit of looking around the building for spots.

Venue: It's very busy therefore very loud, this will not be a quiet dining experience. 

Dining experience: You can get a huge plate of pad thai for $11, that's value. Probably the best value I've ever gotten for pad thai. They can make it to accommodate your dietary restrictions as well (for the most part). Wait staff were friendly, and always had a smile on their faces. Service was excellent. A friend recommended this place to us, so we went as a group of 6 with her, and a mutual friend recommended this place to her before that, so word of mouth really gets around well with this place.

Washrooms: Well maintained."}
{"text":"This place offers great food, a wide selection of curry, delicious and large portions of pad thai.

Restoran Malaysia has been a popular restaurant for many years, with many notable dishes such as their curries, pad thai, milk tea. The pricing is reasonable but I wouldn't consider it value..as the curry dishes do not come with roti or rice..it can be added at an additional cost of ~$3 per.

The restaurant is closed on Mondays, and have very strict seating rules..they do not seat you if you do not have more than half your party present..even if the restaurant is empty.

I believe that since a massive power outage in the summer (two years ago), they have taken advantage of that and it has been cash only..I am not sure if they have changed this in the recent months."}
{"text":"Love the food and the restaurant is spacious and pleasant.  

Some of the tastiest Asian food in the GTA.  Reasonably priced for the quality of food.  

The only bad thing about the restaurant is the parking lot is tight.  The lunch specials are solid especially the Phad Thai.

Wonderful!"}
{"text":"I spent 5 years of my childhood in Borneo.  The flavours of this place reminds me of my childhood.  I've visited Malaysia since then just to check if the flavours in my memories are really what I think they are.  And they are.  Restoran Malaysia is the real deal!

My favourites here:

Roti with curry - you don't even need the meat!  The sauce is just so good!  Tasty, tasty goodness.  I have to stop myself from ordering more and getting too full for the rest of the meal

Kuey Teow - this is the ONLY place I have every come across in the GTA that does char kuey teow properly (and I mean so that it tastes the same as Malaysia).

Fried chicken - crispy, salty, succulent without being too oily.  I'll take this over Southern fried chicken any day!  The fried prawn crackers are a welcome addition"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my husband. I ordered the Dom Yum soup and lunch menu curry chicken. It was nice and spicy. My husband had the corn soup and beef with flat noodles. His portion was very large. The food was very good. It was a good thing we got there at 11:30 as the restaurant started filling up at 12:00. 
Will go there again with more people so I can try out the other dishes."}
{"text":"The food here is really only average. If you're craving for Malaysian food, this is a very safe choice. However, nothing about this place stood out to me, there wasn't anything spectacularly special about Restoran Malaysia.

I read other reviews that stated the pricing as expensive and I beg to differ. The pricing I feel is very fair. I'm not saying the dishes were cheap, but you do get A LOT of whatever it is you are ordering. I came with my boyfriend and even though we each ordered an entree, it was just way too much food. Beware that with the noodle dishes, you are getting a lot, so come with a bunch of friends so you can try different dishes and share or you'll risk getting sick of your meal after you finish half of it.

The one thing I really did love here is the chicken and beef skewers. OMG. They were just so succulent and juicy, and the peanut sauce that came with it was made perfectly. 

Customer service was good and prompt, when we got the rest of our food to-go, it came in a nice plastic tupperware, which was nice.

Next time, if I ever come back, as this restaurant is a bit of a drive from where I live, I will try the sea bass as recommended by one of the other yelpers. As sea bass is my fav. fish. If I like it, I will up my rating to a 4/5."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere, good
service! The mediterranean sea bass was great, with several vegetables in the curry sauce, including okra, tomatoes, eggplants. Skin nice and crispy but really so many bones. This is what made my rating a 3.5 star rather than 3. The chicken wings were small and a bit overcooked with the skin kinda burnt. The roti curry beef was alright, but portion size was small. Roti fluffy. The drink menu of teas seemed appetizing; unfortunately they forgot to bring me my tea so I never got to try it. I prefer gourmet malaysia in a heartbeat (garlicky roti with better portions and flavour, more casual atmosphere and better value). May try again if wanting malaysian fix in this area."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here. The server made a mistake with my order and the response I got when I inquired about it was condescending and belligerent.

The food was good, but I really didn't like the service."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on the weekday. The food was alright, nothing amazing to rave about. I ordered the Indonesian fried rice. The dish was flavourful and surprisingly had a lot of shrimp. 

Okay so the negative about this place are; parking may be a little difficult as this place is located in a small plaza with a lot of other businesses, water tasted like tap if it were out too long? Our food came out in literally 5 min, mind you we were a group of 9 getting different dishes. Thai express can't even manage that so im a little weary about the freshness of the food. Lastly they charged us 15% tip automically on our bill. I don't mind paying that as that's usually the min I give but the fact that they didn't even advise before hand was a shock to me.

Tip! This place is cash only..... I don't believe they have an ATM either."}
{"text":"I head to Restoran Malaysia usually to fulfill a Nasi Goreng craving. Theirs comes with prawn crisps which work so perfectly with the fried rice. Soups are spot on but some flavourants in the bowl are inedible. I don't think I've had a bad meal here food-wise, nothing that I've tried is worse than above average regardless of origin.

My major gripe is that it is cash-only and, as a millennial who typically doesn't carry cash, I need to plan ahead before heading here, even though prices are definitely reasonable. Expect long lines and noisy at weekend dinner."}
{"text":"This place was just ok for me, primarily 'cause I picked the wrong dish!  

Wanting to try something different, as per the name of this restaurant, I chose \"Malay Kari Ayam\" off the lunch menu.  When it arrived, it was just a coconut based, yellow curry that I could've gotten at any Viet/Thai type place.  :(

Friend ordered Nasi Goring which, to me, tasted like...fried rice.  Sure, it had a nice, hot wok aroma to it, but in the end, we both ended up with dishes that we could've eaten closer to home.

Both lunch portions were decently sized, nasi goring seemed bigger than yellow curry, each were $8.  Would've seemed like better value if it came with a small drink/salad.

We also ordered the Calamari app ($9) and I thought it was overly salted with a pickled salad side that was overly sweet!  Calamari pieces themselves were on the small-medium side, but there were enough of them to share with 1 other person.

I did order a Guava Coconut drink which was decent, but then again, it was also $5.  It tasted like a very subtle pina colada, I couldn't taste any guava.  I was also eyeing the Teh Tarik, which basically sounded like a HK milk tea, but at $4/5 that was a hell no!  More expensive than Starbucks??  Hopefully it's a grande/venti size!

Overall, I'd go again only *if* I were in the area.  (Not really worth the drive from Mississauga.)  Next time, I'd probably order something from the Roti portion of the menu as everything else (description-wise) sounds like something that I've had elsewhere...but $2-3 more!

Tip:  Read descriptions carefully 'cause their exotic names may fool you into thinking that you're trying something new when it's actually same old-same old."}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant often and have been since like, 10 years ago when they weren't that popular. Their food is always too notch deliciousness. 

Your order MUST CONSIST OF:
1. Lai tsa (pulled milk tea). If you love a delicious coffee style drink its definitely the go to
2. Curry and Roti. Their roti is near perfect thickness and tenderness. There is just something so wonderful about it as you dip it and put into your mouth
3. Pad Thai - the right stuff 

I've gone with a Malaysian friend who has given it thumbs up. 

Their servers are very kind! And super friendly and helpful. Its also fast service for such a big restaurant :)"}
{"text":"The food is great, and so is the service. Last time I dined there was with my family and my brother new everything that was great on the menu.
This time I went with two friends, one who is vegan. We asked the server what she recommended ( what was most popular) and we took her advice and ate that. Everything was amazing, great flavours and presentation. 
It was my friends first time and as leaving they thanked me for taking them and said we need to come back. 
Thank you for an amazing dining experience, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, ordered two lunch special, Pad Thai and pineapple fried rice. The server was very pay attention to details, asked if we have any nuts allergy, that was very thoughtful. However the food was below average. Pad Thai was bland,  fried rice was still very moist. Didn't taste any \"dragin air\" from the wok, just like Korean style bibibmbap mixed everything together.  I also ordered a pull tea, the sweetness was right and the tea itself was smooth, however lack of tea favor feels like drinking Milk, maybe just myself get used to the strong tea favor from HK style milk tea. Price was fair two dishes + a drink cost ~$25."}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant a few times and love that their food is halal! They offer big menu of a variety of meat, veggie, rice, noodles etc. The last time we came we ordered the red curry, angel beef, mee goring noodles with rotis on the side. The beef was moist and tender and not as spicy as I thought it would be, the noodles were flavourful and sweet tasting with chicken and shrimp. The red curry was a bit watery and chicken was chewy. We also ordered the mango smoothie and didn't like it at all. It was literally mango juice with slush. Not the smoothies with fresh fruit. Overall there food is good but not the best. The food is a hit or miss each time. The food being halal is definitely appealing!"}
{"text":"I have known of this place for quite a while. And being from south east Asia, my expectations for Malaysian food is relatively high. That being said, I was fairly impressed by the restaurant, service and the food. I ordered the char kuay teow as well as the curry fried rice. The food came quickly for the restaurant being eager busy. The portions are also massive. Unless you're a big boy, chances are you won't be finishing your whole order. 
Overall, I give this place 4 stars for the good service and good quantity of food. 
Also, they only take cash."}
{"text":"A Malaysian friend took me and made some recommendations. Now, for the record, I don't have a sophisticated palate for Asian food, so it's not surprising maybe that I could've passed on most of the dishes (I found them to be either bland or have a fishy taste). However, I thoroughly enjoyed the roti and curry and would happily come back and order just that."}
{"text":"It's my very first time to dine at Restoran Malaysia and the food was superb!Loved the Singapore Laksa and pineapple fried rice.their coffee with condensed milk was yum.servers were very nice and friendly.cash only basis didnt surprise me,thanks to the reviews that i read last night.this place is"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to have dinner at this dimly-lit cozy Malaysian restaurant where not only was the food light and tasty but the service adequate; Initially warm and progressively \"Malaysian Militia\". We tipped nicely nonetheless...Being my first take at Malaysian cuisine; I had an excellent experience; The green mango salad was addictive as was the green curry vegetable dish; Which was an excellent choice to start off with despite its overwhelmingly watery texture. I will opt for the RED curry vegetable dish the next time..Yes, I want to come back for more! 

4 stars-for the cuisine
3-stars-for the service"}
{"text":"Used to be great for Malaysian food, but the quality and flavour seems to have dropped off. Better options in Toronto now."}
{"text":"We've lived a 5 minute walk from this restaurant for years and even frequently visit the plaza its in (for Benjamin Moore & Subway) without ever paying attention to it.  A friend told us about it so we checked it out and WOW is it ever good.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside is very nice and the food is to die for.  

We now order takeout from here at least once every 2 weeks!

Great place... Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I seen so many great reviews on this place so I took my family there.  Please bring cash because their interac and credit machines don't work.  We ordered spring rolls and it looked promising but had to send them back because they were sour.  The green curry chicken smelt like sewage.  We told the manager the curry tastes funny and she said that is how they make it.  Without even looking to see if there was a problem with our curry she simply told us the smell is from the bamboo shoot in the curry.  Really...I didnt know they made sewage bamboo shoot in a can.  The roti is definitely from a frozen package.  Mango salad was so weak.  Will never come back.  $80 of food poisoning wtf.  The health department definitely needs to check them out soon!"}
{"text":"Have given them a few \"second chances\" but too late.  Especially since I discovered Gourmet Malaysia.  The food is exquisite there.  Restoran Malaysia, in my opinion, caters to \"western tastes\", i.e. watered down galangal and balachan.  Noodles overcooked and food arrived cold.  Surly, miserable staff who never even say thank you when you pay.  Clearly they hate their jobs.  Food is totally average.  Their fruit juices are exceptional ... but I don't drive to a Malaysian restaurant for the juices.  SERIOUSLY overpriced for what you (don't) get.  They used to be good and for a long time they were the only game in town.  Thank goodness for competition!  I would not suggest this place."}
{"text":"When I worked in the area, we would treat ourselves once every week or two and go here for lunch and just GORGE ourselves. I switched jobs and stopped working close by and didn't come back for years. I'm not kidding, I was always sad about that. It just wasn't close! 

Well, I happened to be in the area a few nights ago and of course, it only made sense to go back. It was exactly as I remembered it....AMAZING! The food is SO excellent here and the service is just amazingly quick. We got our food in I'd say under five minutes! Our water glasses were always full and the portions are so large, you can easily make one meal stretch to two. Just thinking about it right now makes me want to go back! 

So why the loss of one star? 

Well...this is a tricky one. You see, the service was great, BUT there was probably one of the rudest and most annoying families I have ever encountered at a restaurant in my life...other than the time I was eating at a Kelsey's and a kid was literally running circles around the restaurant screaming and when I quietly asked the parents if they could quiet their child the dad told me to f-off, in front of his three year old...because they were celebrating a \"religious occasion\"....right, where was I? Yes, so this family was divided so that the approx 2 year old was sitting farthest away from all parents, in a booster seat and shouting and screeching loudly, while banging a spoon against the table. The other two yong boys, who appeared to be acting as the caregivers, where egging him on, trying to make him scream louder. The waiter took care of the spoon, by quietly taking away the metal one and replacing it with a plastic one, but the kid kept shouting.

Now, I want to be clear. I don't blame the restaurant for bad parenting. I understand that this is a tricky situation. You don't want to single out any of your guests and lose business. But here's the thing. There were four adults there that you might lose business from, vs. the other 10-12 adults you very well could lose business from, because people were visibly upset with this kid and his parents. 

The other thing is that there was an easy solution. Half of the restaurant, on the other side of the building, was not being used, simply because there were not enough patrons to require it. Having a waiter approach the family and politely offer them a table in that room, as it would allow their child to continue being a bit nosier, would both get rid of them AND probably show them that they need to control their terrible offspring. 

As it was, nothing was resolved and we did not stick around for dessert. As we were leaving, a man sitting across from the family was looking like he might burst into flames. I asked if it was annoying enough for him and he shock his head and loudly said, \"I'm going to f-ing LOSE it.\" So yeah...may want to take care of that situation. Having your patrons enjoy their time is SO important to their experience. 

OH! And if you're a family with kids, everyone knows that kids make noise and can be rambunctious at times...it's still your job to ensure they are being polite. People managed to have their children be polite in public for hundreds of years. Surely it's not impossible in the year 2012. A good start would be to sit WITH them."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened.... I went back last weekend but was quite disappointed. I ordered the same thing from my first visit cuz I had a hugeeee craving for the fried rice again. But this time it was so bland...:( You know it's a problem when you feel you could make smth similiar at home. Heard the usual chef might've gone to the new location. boooo"}
{"text":"A lot of people say there are no good places to eat in Richmond Hill. They're half right because it's one or the other in richmond hill - good food or good service. Finding both is rare.

Restoran Malayasia's food is amazing. Service is a hit or miss. Accept this and then you will have a good time.

It openend about 5 years ago, and then closed a year later to expand because of it's popularity. It opened up again about 3 times the size with a much more modern upscale look. Not bad because it used to be kinda divey.

The food is really good. Malaysian food is kinda like thai meets chinese meets indian. Richer curries, spicier food, rose syrups and condensed milk, and roti's.  Definately an amazing experience.
The place tends to attract a large muslim crowd because the food is also halal and decently priced. This is a good sign that a restaurant is providing good value.

Food wise, nasi goreng is a must (fried rice with egg), the curries are amazing but watch the spice level, chili chicken is a favourite, but the only thing i would not order again is the pad thai. It just looks and tastes funny (red in colour) from what i'm used to. Also, order a thai iced tea - they're caloric and glorious. 

You will have to wait for a table - this place is that busy. Also i think they close at 10"}
{"text":"I get takeout regularly. The food is inconsistently good with decent portion sizes! Cash only can get a bit inconvenient, but it hasn't deterred us yet. My only complaint is that when I get the vegetarian Mamakmee goring there isn't much tofu. It can get really busy if you go at peak times, plan accordingly! Quick service though."}
{"text":"First time trying this place on a recommendation from a friend. We started with a beef roti - highly recommend. Lovely roti with perfect amount golden bits yet still soft and chewy. Lovely curry with a nice amount of heat.  Also loved the beef and chicken satays. Highly recommend. 


RENDANG MINANGKABAU beef was tasty, again with nice flavours but I found it to be a bit dry. We also tried the fish (dried) Sambal. Nice heat but didn't love the fish - wish I had tried chicken or beef.  Mee Goring was good as well - well cooked noodles, nice plump shrimp grits were s flavour. 

Looking forward to trying a few more dishes. 

Price $100 for three with no drinks with tax and tip. Feels a bit steep but we easily had enough food to feed 1-2 more. Cash only is a pain should deduct a star for that as well."}
{"text":"I truly love this place. Let me preface this with saying that I was not a curry fan, I never liked curry and normally I refused to eat it. I have now been converted after I finally tried the dishes at this place... The curry is just so smooth and not overpowering. The tastes are just perfectly blended together. If you go during lunch they have a lunch menu that gives you good portions for very good prices. The portions in general are very good. This place is actually quite big and has a lot of seating but it is very popular/busy on the weekends during lunch hours so you will probably be in for a wait. And most importantly remember that they only accept cash!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Restoran Malaysia for 10 years.  It used to be a tiny, and poorly decorated dive with sticky vinyl tablecloths that served great food with great service.  

Today in their expanded and more modern space they continue to thrive and still have pretty good food.

It's one of our favourite places to cater from; their tray prices are reasonable and the food quality is good (but I think $2 per roti is too much).

Favourites of ours include:

kuay teow noodles
malay beef curry
roti
rendang beef"}
{"text":"The Good
Wholesome yummy malay, good portion sizes

The Bad:

Cash Only (had to walk to the esso next door to pull money out costed an aditional 3 bucks 

The Ugly

Being compelled by the waiter to leave them a tip?!!? \"no change back is okay??\"

Hot ginger tea n lychee freeze was gud enough to wash down 
The succulent satay beef n lamb skewrs
And Indonesian fried rice full of color n flavour! Cant wait to try their rotis the next time. Beef murtabak was a bit dry cudnt care to order the 3 buck side curry
Total bill 45.77 forced tip plus."}
{"text":"Nice place! We had Roti Canai with chicken and the vegetable Dhall. Chicken sauce was nice but the dhall was average. Also had the chicken murtabak for starters which I would not recommend - very average. For mains, we had the crab in Malay Kari, Mee Goreng noodles and Chicken in Tamarind sauce - have to say, the mains were delicious! Especially the crab curry. Would definitely go again and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Always great to eat here, food is as delicious as you'd get in Singapore and Malaysia, great quality food, good dining atmosphere and always amazing desserts. Love this place!! Recommend roti with curry sauce, satay beef skewers, pad Thai, shrimp chips, Malaysian fried rice and coconut purple rice."}
{"text":"The food here is really really good. I'm from Indonesia and Malaysian cuisine is really similar to Indonesian. The food is very authentic and flavorful. We ordered Mamak mee goring, ayam goring kampung, rendang minang, and yellow curry. All of them are extremely tasty. If only they're closer to Toronto, I will go there every week."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the area! Never tasted calamari like this before, make sure to dip it in the sauce it comes with. Also, recommend the Malaysian curry mixed with the Indonesian fried rice....delicious!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Try the green curry and peanuts chicken. The Satay Beef wasn't that great but the peanut sauce it came with was good. The fried rice was the best I had in Canada. The waiters and service is pretty bad though."}
{"text":"Picked up a takeaway. Excellent food. By far one of the best Malaysian restaurants I have ordered from!"}
{"text":"Its a small place in the corner of the owl plaza. Its actually quite big inside and I went on a Saturday so it was packed with people and a line up at the door. 

I had to wait in line so I sat at the bar where they make their pulled milk tea and all those slushie drinks! It was quite an awesome view. The lady was definitely very skilled. 

Once I got sat down, I ordered the satay beef skewers ($8) for 6 skewers, coconut curry chicken ($10), roti ($4 for 2 pieces), pad Thai ($13), ice pulled milk tea and a mango slushie drink! The skewers were amazingly tender and moist and had full flavor. I would go back just for those skewers. The pad Thai was made quite well as the noodles are chewy and not too soft. The coconut curry was kind of disappointing, sad to say. I thought there should have been more kick to it. It was quite bland but you can definitely taste the flavor in the back of your throat. The pulled milk tea was good just wished it had a little more sugar to my liking. 

Overall I'd recommend it to try once but other than that I'm sure I'll be going back for more beef or chicken skewers!"}
{"text":"Seeing some of the negative reviews on here, I was somewhat hesitant to try Restoran Malaysia. I was pleasantly blown away. The assam laksa is amazing!! It was just as good as the one I had in Kuala Lumpur. Rich hearty broth with a based of tamarind, shrimp paste, pieces of mackerel, and rice noodles topped with fresh pineapple and cucumber. It's sour, savoury, and slightly sweet. The Hainanese chicken rice and roti are also excellent. I think the trick is to stick to their Malaysian items, which they clearly excel at."}
{"text":"PARENTS BEWARE. They didn't allow our 14 months old baby to eat the homemade food in the restaurant. We left right away."}
{"text":"Great Food, Cheap Price, Friendly Staff. What else do you need?

Place is great, we ordered the pad thai which is only $10 and the two of us together could not finish it. The rest of the gang ordered various items like the sweet and sour chicken which looked great and had a lot of fresh vegis in it which is a nice touch. Even the drinks were great. Can't remember the name but it tasted a lot like a virgin Pina Colada which was great. Can't think of anything bad to say about the place other than no reservations and no alcohol there but that ain't enough to hurt this place at all."}
{"text":"Portions are smaller, the quality has gone down but the price has remained the same. Very disappointed in this place. Would not recommend to family or friends."}
{"text":"To start off, this place is ALWAYS busy. They are pretty big with plenty of seating but that is not true with the parking outside. It's a pretty small parking lot (with a collection of pot holes the last time I came), so good luck with that if you're coming here on the weekend. After you brace the parking outside, prepare for your delicious meal inside.

Been here a couple of times and justified that pretty much everything is good on the menu. Skewers and curries are a must try here. No questions asked. Their rotis are also very fresh, warm, crispy, and chewy. And goes oh so well with their curries. Their Hai Nan chicken and rice is my personal fave. The chicken is meaty and tender (not dry at all), and rice is very flavourful. With the hai nan chicken, you usually only get a few pieces of them served on top of the rice, but here they put to what looked like half the chicken on a separate plate, drowned with some amazing sauce and garlic, and then garnished with a bit of parsley. Another fave is the Tom Yum soup. Personal tip when you're drinking this soup: take your time, but don't let it go cold of course. Once you choke, you're done, and it's like an endless feat of coughing. With just the right amount of spices and chilliness, it's a nice starter to your meal, not to mention it really warms you up. It's also good enough for 2 people.

After all that goodness, wash it all down with a nice tall glass of Thai iced tea, which is not iced tea to say the least, but more like iced 'milk tea' with an orangey hue to it. I find that they do come a bit sweet so ask for less sweetness if you want. Less ice might also be a nice option so it doesn't water anything down.

For the amount of food you get and what you pay for, it is worth your buck. Definitely a fave in this area."}
{"text":"I drive by here all the time and stupidly forget it exists! Located in a tiny plaza that also houses a small comic book store, convenience store, a dry cleaners, and a Subway you wouldn't think a restaurant here would be the most amazing Malaysian/Thai places you have ever allowed your lips to touch.

The dingy blue sign with crappy yellow font may just turn you off but persevere and walk through those doors that look like you're entering a dry cleaners and you are welcomed with dark hardwood flooring, a long dark wood bar, dark wood dividers, dark wood tables, green walls, and I'm pretty sure more dark wood elsewhere. As dark as it sounds, it is actually laid out very nice, it looks super trendy inside and you would never think that a restaurant like this would be here.

Not only are you surprised by the portal that transports you from the bleak Suburbia or Richmond Hill but you get hit in the face, in a good way, with explosions of delicious Malay and Thai flavors. The best textured rotis I have ever tried. Oh their curries? Only the most flavorful green curry ever! You don't like green curry? They have ever colored curry imaginable and they are all spectacular. Satay is absolute gold! I have yet to try anything in this restaurant without being completely floored by its perfect balance of complexity and home made goodness.

Service is also pretty amazing. Even on nights when the house is rammed full of people the 5 servers manage to stay on top of everything and ensure your food gets to your face as quickly and deliciously as possible. Always checking up at the proper times and noticing small cues. Some high end restaurant owners can learn a thing or two from this suburban gem.

Overall, the best roti.... ever. Better than the ones I've had in Malaysia and what I compare all other roti to. Prices are a little high and portion sizes are decent but the quality of food is downright amazing. When you ask me what restaurant I want to go to my answer will be none. I want to go to a Restauran."}
{"text":"Restoran Malaysia is great!! Unfortunately they don't take reservations, but you are seated relatively fast. For lunch you will definitely get a seat without waiting...dinner on the weekends is a different story. Nonetheless you are seated relatively fast (or you could just call ahead and opt for take-out and the food still tastes just as great). 

I've come here quite a few times and the food quality has stayed consistent throughout. The servers are also very friendly and easily split bills with your party. 

I have lots of favourite items here, and they have a good variety of dishes from the Malaysian/Thai region which are quite outstanding compared to other Thai restaurants in the area. The kuay tow flat noodle beef dish is quite good, along with Indonesian nasi goreng fried rice (served with shrimp chips), the curries (all are great, but if you can't handle spicy - don't get Thai green curry), Tom yum soup, and mamak me goreng (a thick egg noodle type dish with chicken and shrimp as main ingredients). Pass on the Pad Thai, I wouldn't say it's their speciality. 

The desserts are also not bad (sticky rice cake), but I would just stick with the main food items. 

Make sure you bring cash though as they don't accept credit cards. The prices have gone up more recently, but it's definitely reasonable and comparable to other places in the area...the only reason why it's not a 5 star review from me."}
{"text":"Food taste really good, especially the roti and curry! Have an authentic feeling there. Food are served in good portion, great for sharing.

Sitting is comfortable, table is big, lots of space for plates. Service is nice, staff are polite and friendly. 

One star is deducted because of the rushing feeling. They would take away your plates even before you are completely finished. There's no more line up at the time but they seem to rush the tables to finish, pay and leave. Not a place to chat and spend time to enjoy dinner. Great for a tasty quick dinner."}
{"text":"Lunch special till 3. Quantity and quality is still very high. Vegetarian options available but was told thai basil is a little better for vegetarians. I think this place is overall better though.

Atmosphere is very nice too. I like the portion size over thai basil."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Peranakan curry fish and the chilli chicken.  The Indonesian friend rice (with chicken and shrimp) was too bland for my taste and just ok.  The Fried Banana with coconut ice-cream was also good but not outstanding.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  I would go back but will read past reviews beforehand to get a better idea of what to order next time."}
{"text":"Been going here for over 5 years now and this place never gets old.  The roti and coconut rice have got to be the highlights.  

Parking is a bit of a problem, but in the end, we come here for the food, so 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Restauran Malaysia. I really did. 

On paper, the ingredients were all there: fiery, inexpensive ethnic cuisine; recommendations from my foodie friends and one of the cutest girls at the office; My brother, arguably the second-most adventurous palate in the family, is apparently a fixture at lunch. He swears by the place. On the strength of my visit, I'd just swear at it. 

Maybe it was our mistake. We arrived on a rainy Saturday evening. We'd been warned that line-ups form early, so we called ahead to ask how long the wait would be and perhaps reserve a seat. We were told that they didn't take reservations, but that the wait was only about 10 minutes. 

Famous last words.

We pulled up to the restaurant and ran to the door, and were almost bounced out by a solid wall of would-be patrons. After fighting our way to the maitre d' stand, a single harried hostess waved us in the direction of the bar. Like most of the crowd, we politely declined and asked how long it would be until we were seated. 10 minutes doubled to 20. 

What followed was an onslaught of customers jamming the entrance. Tables turned over but the wait staff could barely keep up. Our hostess ran back and forth through cavernous room, occasionally shepherding a bewildered group to its table. The lack of communication between front and back of house made the wait needlessly long and unpleasant.  20 minutes turned to 30, 40, 50, 60, 70. 

From it's strip-mall perch, the only options nearby were chain pizza and a Boston Market that may or may not have been open. We were stuck. And low on blood sugar. And increasingly angry. 

Finally, our number came up, Not even my attempts at \"give them the wrong name humour\" could salvage our moods. Dick Hertz would not save this day. We were dampened by rain, sweaty from the wait, and defeated by our stint as sardines in the foyer. 

I'll plead ignorance as to the authenticity of the food. The menu promised authentic Malaysian cooking, and may well have delivered, alongside the usual pan-Asian suspects.  Then again, sharing a land or sea border with Thailand, Viet Nam, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines may lend itself to some culinary cross-over. Malaysia is a predominantly Muslim country, which might explain the lack of pork and booze for sale, and the wide range of coffee, tea and juice options. 

Appetizers took their time to arrive, but were worth the wait. Fresh roti with curry sauce was pleasantly creamy and flavourful, and performed double duty with some of the more DIY dishes. A bowl of shrimp chips offered savory Styrofoam crunch, although accompanying peanut sauce verged on cloying sweetness. Nonya fried chicken (marinated ahead of time in shrimp paste) was pure crispy fried umami, and worth a return visit on its own. 

Mains ranged from good to bad, None challenged the chicken's supremacy. Sambal shrimp were what you'd expect; plump shrimp that popped against your closing jaw; swimming in chilli and tomatoes. The tomatoes were actually the better part of the dish. Yellow curry shrimp were slightly overdone, but saved by a variety of crisp vegetables, and more of that complex low-spiced sweetness in their sauce. Basil chicken amped the heat up just a bit, and proved the most popular with the least adventurous in our group. Penang Fried Kuay Teow was the best of the lot; broad rice noodles in a mildly sweet-and-spicy sauce, buttressed by chicken and more seafood. Our table cleared the huge portion in minutes. 

Beef Rendang is supposedly Malaysia's national dish; a testament to the complex flavors and heady aromas that come with careful slow-cooking of even the most inexpensive ingredients. Our bowl of brisket was dry; the promised sauce a loamy mixture that spoke mostly of coarsely ground peanut and coconut. It rested, mostly untouched on peoples' plates. White rice was ordered to soak up the array of sauces, but somehow never made its way to our table. It did land on our bill, until we pointed out the error. 
 
Desserts speak best for themselves: \"Let the sago pearls dance on your taste buds and savour the rich coconut cream and palm sugar syrup it is served in\". We skipped the dancing pearls, although the tea was good in its hot wet astringency. 

Service was less welcoming than it was mutually hostile. Wait staff bounced from table to table, visibly irked when pulled out of their course-by-course routine."}
{"text":"I've been to Restoran Malaysia a few times, often ordering their Roti and Curry. Never found it to be anything phenomenal. Until recently my friend brought me here and STOPPED me from ordering curry again because that was apparently the safe way out and that I've been ordering the wrong things from this restaurant the whole time. Instead, we got the Singapore Chicken Rice, Indonesian Fried Rice, and the Nasi Lemak Malaka (coconut rice with 5 sides including pickled veggies, rendang beef, peanuts) and WOW--flavour explosion. I wasn't expecting much from the Singapore Chicken Rice since I've lived my whole life on Hainanese Chicken Rice, but Restoran Malaysia's Chicken Rice was equally as good as the best I've had around the area. The indonesian fried rice was also packed with savoury-salty-sweet flavours, but the spotlight goes to Nasi Lemak Malaka. That was probably the most unique dish I've ever had from this restaurant and the flavours were phenomenal; a little spicy/savoury from the rendang beef, balanced out by the sourness of the pickled veggies and onions, texture added by the peanuts, yummy creamy coconuty tasting rice, and an egg to finish it all off--perfection.

I'm so glad my friend stopped me from ordering curry again, because I now have a new spot to go to for Malaysian food!"}
{"text":"I have forgotten about this place for almost 10 years. My expectation for this place was not very high when my best friend invited me for dinner recently. I love their dishes! They still got it and is honestly as good as it can get in Richmond Hill. We ordered the satay chicken as appie and two types of curry as main. The portions were big and the curry was very flavorful. I would recommend anyone to come here if they haven't visited this place in a while. New comers, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I last been this place. I re- visited Restoran  Malaysia over the weekend since I was craving for some Malaysian food. 

Service was great and the waiter that helped us knew the dishes well and was very efficient. I liked how the lady who took us to our seats prompted us right at the door that they only accept cash in this restaurant.

I would suggest to stick with the true Malaysian dishes. Thai dishes were mediocre. So far, this is the only place apart from Soo's that serves the closest thing to a Malaysian Fried Kuey Teow. Their curries were good, a recommended try!"}
{"text":"This place has so many delicious options on the menu, I wonder why I didn't patronize it more often in the past. Their curries are authentic and delicious. Their rotis are freshly baked, soft and moist on the inside, just the way I like 'em. It's a nice departure from the usual Chinese / Japanese fare in Richmond Hill / Markham. The service is great too. The waitresses and waiters are all friendly and will help you pick something that would satisfy your taste if you're not sure. Honestly, I have nothing bad to say about Restoran Malaysia. I look forward to eating there every single time.

Note: this place is CASH ONLY. Debit or credit cards are not accepted."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Friday evening and waited for half an hour.  The restaurant does not take reservations.
All the staff were harried and working at capacity.  Any personal touch, or even a smile by our waitress was not to be had.
Once our food arrived (nasi goreng, pad thai and another nasi dish), we were given plates for only two of the four of us.  Getting the waitresses attention was virtually impossible.  I got up from my chair three times in order to get her attention...she was too busy to look our way whenever she was close by.  At the time, I felt that she was angry with us....on second thought, I thing she was just over-worked.
The food was bland.  The pad thai and nasi goreng are dishes I am familiar with and I have had better in many other restaurants.
For lack of decent service from the hostess, to the bar tender, to the waitress....no one gave us so much as a hello or a smile. And, for the bland food....two stars."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant; most definitely a local favourite... As another reviewer mentioned the variation in customers who do come in really shows the versatile community and the variety of ethnicities who do venture and eat different foods making the GTA what it is... Overall great atmosphere, great food! The roti and curry sauce are a must try and the chinese broccoli with ginger is awesome! Although I do feel they need to update their menus as they are starting to fall apart."}
{"text":"Been here more times than I can count since it's literally a 2 minute drive from where I live. Very busy on weekends but always consistent in food quality. 
Indonesian fried rice.. It's delicious, I would never get excited over this dish but it goes very well with a lot of other dishes. If you're a big group def order this. 
Coconut curry...This is pretty yummy especially on top of some steamed rice. Get sick of it pretty quickly though. 
Pad Thai... My favourite dish and always delicious. Portion is huge for one person.
Pineapple chicken and beef... Delicious but the beef is better than the chicken in my opinion. 
Roti... Super yummy but gets stale very quickly so this should be one of the first things you eat
Coconut rice... Meh tastes okay. The steamed rice is better. 
Overall awesome place with huge portions. They are also super attentive and caring when it comes to any allergies or food intolerances which is a huge plus for me."}
{"text":"I have been back to this place many times and it does not disappoint. Well, except for the dessert area. I think that's why I took off a star initially. I dream about this place. 4.5 stars for food! 

Service is generally decent. Less great when it's really crowded but amenable. (It can get difficult to have a server back at your table or check on you at certain times.)"}
{"text":"first \"cash only\", now a compulsory 15% service charge?

the direction they are going is a little disappointing, regardless how good they keep the food to be."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience with their customer service, and speaking to their manager did not suffice.

We ordered this dish and our group didn't realize until afterwards (but the dish was still plentiful) that one of the main ingredients were missing. We asked one of the server and she brought in the manager. However all we got was that \"it's only eggplant\" and gave us a hard time, even though the dish is called \"belacan egg plant with shrimp\"

I've not been back since, and does not want to be again."}
{"text":"In the Richmond Hill area, and decided to come through this spot and let me tell you I had to try everything on the menu. 

First time walking in loved the decor of the place beautiful vibe and the servers took care of us. I asked the server what she recommends and gave us some awesome suggestions. 

Got the 2 roti with curry chicken, fried chicken wings, oxtail soup, and these noodles with beef. The flavour wasn't the greatest the oxtail soup was something I never had before and the fried chicken wings were great with the sauce. 

Overall the food was okay, loved the vibe and the place more than the food. Would I come again? I would definitely come again because it's such a nice place."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. I didn't do a review the first time but I remembered I had an excellent time and the food was amazing and I remembered waiting over an hour for a table since the don't make reservations it's first come first serve. 5 years later I'm trying Restoran Malaysia again. This time around when I got there the place was empty. I don't remember the place feeling dirty.  The service was prompt and great. We ordered chicken wings and mango salad to start and for our mains we had red Thai beef curry, sweet and sour fish and basil egg plants. All in all the food was ok nothing special.  I think I had better at other place. I didn't get the Malaysian flavouring in the food. I probably won't come back since for just the price I pay i might as well go to a authentic Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I've passed by the Major Mac & Bayview area a lot and always passed by Restorable Malaysia but I took the time to stop by for lunch.

Ordered the Chicken Red Curry with a side of coconut rice & Pad Thai. I spent most of my life eating Jasmine rice, so I was really excited to taste the rice on its own. Very creamy and delicious, I could honestly eat out by itself.

After a couple of bites of the Red Curry, I was constantly grabbing my glass of water... a bit saltier then what I was expecting.

The Pad Thai was mediocre at best - I didn't get much flavour and the noodles were a bit drier than usual. At times, I ended up mixing the Red Curry and Pad Thai together to get a decent balance.

It's really unfortunate since I've read a lot of good reviews on this restaurant. The servers were very nice regardless, but I wish I could say the same about the food.

I'll definitely consider giving this place a second shot though."}
{"text":"This is really 3 1/2 stars.
I came in for lunch with my husband.

I went to Paneng, Malaysia in March so I was reminiscent of the noodle dish, Asam Laksa.  In Paneng, hawker stalls are common.  And, I remember ordering this pineapple, tamarind, slightly fish soup with rice noodles.  My husband was walking around looking for his own dish (he's vegetarian) while I sat by myself on a plastic stool (with a plastic table) enjoying this $1 noodle soup.  And, there were so many flavors (salty, sweet, sour, savor) that it tasted familiar and foreign at the same time.  Definitely the best soup of my life.  So, I do understand that the environment and situation plays a huge role in he way we perceive our food as well.

Unfortunately, I didn't get that same experience with the asam laksa at this restaurant.  My expectations were just too high and it just tasted different from what I had anticipated.  I was hoping that a sip of the soup would somehow magically transport me back to that day.  I also prefer my soup a little thinner.  The dish was good, but not amazing.  But, it could be a cultural/regional thing.  I'm also Vietnamese so I'm used to the thinner soup-like broth you get from pho.

My husband had the curry lunch special and really enjoyed his meal.

I would definitely go back and try something else.  I think, we would order the curry and pad thai lunch with a side of roti.  The table next to us ordered the roti and it looks really soft and delicious.  I was jealous!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and order a couple of dishes: 1) Pad Thai 2) Singapore Chicken Rice 3) Indonesian Fried Rice

Overall the food was amazing and the portion sizes matched the price. The pad Thai was not too saucy with good amount of shrimp and chicken. I was really impressed the fact that the Singapore Chicken was boneless compared to other places that have ho lam chicken rice. The soup was clear and tasty and not too oily. I found the Indonesian fried rice my favourite because of the fried egg and the shrimp chips :)

5/5 rating"}
{"text":"Very good.  The extensive menu brought back many fond memories of dishes I used to eat on a regular basis when I lived in Singapore.  All the dishes we ordered were authentic tasting, delicious and very fresh.  I understand this restaurant has been open for some time, and so seeing how busy it was when we were there was definitely a good sign."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Malaysian restaurant that's been around for a long time.  They don't reservations and have gotten so popular that they expanded to the next unit.

It's situated in a strip mall, with somewhat limited parking.  The decor is pretty modern and the service is pretty good.

I've probably been here a dozen times.  The top dishes I would recommend here are:

Pad Thai - can't go wrong with Pad Thai

Singapore Laksa - there aren't a tonne of restaurants that serve laksa noodles although it has gotten more popular lately in other establishments.  Singapore Laksa is a fusion dish containing chinese, indian and malaysian influences.  It can be quite spicy for the uninitiated but it's great.

Nasi Goering
Penang Char Kuay Teow

I would also recommend their roti bread and ordering a curry to go with it.  I really enjoy their tasty roti bread."}
{"text":"First time here and I had a really good dining experience. We came on a Friday night and it was quite busy, but the restaurant still had an enjoyable and diverse ambiance going. We waited for about 20 mins for a table for two. The staff were very welcoming. We also received prompt, friendly service from our server who was always readily available and did several checks on us. 

The food was delicious and reasonably  priced. The food was brought out quickly and was good in portion size. We ordered three dishes to share, the roti with curry beef, Singapore laksa noodles (rich in flavour), and Singapore chicken with rice (very moist chicken). 

Overall, as a first timer here I loved it and would definitely come back again. The only down side to this place is the lack of parking in the plaza and the \"cash only\" policy. But the hostess offers a friendly reminder initially at the door, which is nice. A lot of restaurants do not mention this on their own. & *minus 1 star for not being able to rub the Buddha at the door for good luck. Lol"}
{"text":"Their menu has is very long but has lots of helpful pictures to guide you along the way. The staff is super helpful and come around often to collect plates and fill up your drink. Ask them and they'll help. 

I find it useful to go in with a very large group, and get a bunch of different dishes so you can sample as much as possible. 

My favourite dish is the Rendang Daging, which is a tender slow-cooked beef stew that falls apart when you look at it! 

Positives: Well established restaurant in the area with lots of customers, friendly and helpful staff, lots of variety in terms of food, lots of flavour, suspiciously low prices 

Negatives: The food is extremely rich and filling. I mean the Nasi Goreng, which is a huge dish of fried rice with eggs and shrimp chips must have at least 2000 calories!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner as a friend said it was quite good. My goodness its GREAT!! Every bite of food has an explosion of flavour in your mouth. I had the hot and sour soup and green curry chicken! Then if that wasnt enough my hubby and I split some sort of flame baked banana dessert with ice cream!!! YOU HAVE TO GO! Plan to get there by 5 or 5:30(ish) they do not take reservations and this place is jam packed after 6!!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant for their large portions and selection, but I find the menu options a bit pricey compared to other Malaysian restaurants. I would pay the premium for large groups as the restaurant is more roomy and clean than others, but I wasn't very impressed by the food."}
{"text":"The last time when I was in Restoran Malaysia was a few years ago. I decided to come back with my friend to tried out the lunch specials so I can yelp about it.

The cheesy Restoran Maylaysia outside of the building does not really match with the interior design of the restaurant. The decoration is calm and soothing with the dim lighting and Zen environment.

We were greeted and seated promptly by the waitstaff. The lunch menu starts from $7.50. We decided on the Thai Curry Chicken and the Pad Thai to be shared between us.

The food arrived so fast! My friend was so amazed... The Pad Thai is good.. not great.. but is good. The Thai Curry Chicken is not too spicy but there are tons of chicken strips inside and it is quite filling.

Though the food are good here. I have to say that they are not really authentic Malaysian dish. Adjustment did made to suit the local market. 

Though it is still a pretty good decent place for Malaysian food. The services were great. The waitstaffs dropped by a few time and make sure that everything were ok and our water glasses got refilled without asking! They even ask us if we want some more hot sauce when they saw our sauce plate was empty! 

haha found this on their website: \"Hot sauce and sambal belachan is available upon request. However, if wasted, a dollar will be charged onto your bill.\" For sure I did not waste any!!

The non-alcoholic drinks menu here are amazing with so many different tropical cocktails that are not offered in other restaurants.

They accepts all credit cards and interac."}
{"text":"Excellent.   I wanted something that many of my co-workers have not tried and this place fit the bill.    We got to try out over 6 dishes ranging from roti, curries, fish cake, banana wrapped beef, pulled milk tea..... I think they enjoyed it all.

Only negative about this place is that the service is horrible and the parking lot is way too small."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times. This place has long line-ups, but I guess this is expected of a delicious traditional Malaysian restaurant. The food here is delicious and authentic.

Everything on the menu from the steamed coconut rice to the Malaysian curry dishes are highly recommened. You can't go wrong ordering anything on the menu.

Service has been slow on a few occasions, but the food makes up for it. This restaurant is a must try for those looking for authentic Malaysian food. Get here early or you will end up waiting quite a bit."}
{"text":"Great Food! Come here all the time for lunch and sometimes dinner. My family and I love Thai food and we're rather picky - a must-try is the Pineapple Sweet & Sour Shrimp!!"}
{"text":"This place is filled with very pleasant surprises.  From our first take-out to the succeeding ones and the numerous dine-ins, its a go-to place for something rich and spicy close to our south-east asian palette.  Their culinary selections from 4 distinct south-east neighboring countries: Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore brings the flavorful freshness and boldness of dishes in various concoctions of coconut and its products, chilies, curry, turmeric, citrus herbs; succulent meat and seafood; savory nuts and sauces to melt the blues away.  Although some may argue its authenticity in terms of taste, especially those who have had the privilege of actually being in those countries, I am happy enough that its not as bold nor too complex as I would have it back there.  The variety of ingredients makes every dish an an exciting meal.  Elegantly woodsy with awesome murals make for a very unique and great interior design.  Great for family, group and social dining.  Come early, this place is always busy.

{"text":"I was here yesterday for lunch and the food and service was excellent.
It has been a long time since I was here and I had always liked the food here and I am happy the food is still very good.

I had the lunch special which is served until 3pm everyday. Amongst my party we shared the chicken red curry, the Nasi Goering, and the Penang Char Kuay Teow. Some of these dishes are spicy, but we asked the waitor to make it extra spicy.
The red curry had a lot of great flavor and heat but I thought the white meat chicken was a bit on the dry side. The Nasi Goering had a lot of great flavours and the rice was fried with dark soy and dried shrimp paste which gave it a nice savory flavor, but wasn't that spicy and it was served with some tasty fried shrimp crackers on top, this was my favorite dish out of the three. The Penang Char Kuay Teow had a lot of plump juicy shrimp, but I didn't detect any spicy heat here but it still tasted good.

Service was very friendly and attentive. The food arrived fairly quickly, and the wait staff stopped by often to see if we needed more hot water for our teapot of jasmine tea.

The restaurant no longer takes credit or debit, only cash, which I thought was odd. 
Malaysian Restaurants are a rarity and not a very well known cuisine in the GTA and I have known people who would make the trek from downtown just to eat here, which I think is definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Definitely high time for an update.  We came for dinner last Sunday.  A few key things had changed.  The menu was totally different from my last visit.  The prices was lower than the last visit.  There was a sign saying they wouldn't accept credit card until further notice.  And the food was better.  

We ordered a Chicken Curry with Roti ($7), a Singapore Chicken Rice ($7.5) and an Appetizer Platter ($23).  Everything was very good.  

1) The curry was watery, but the flavour was rich.  We loved soaking the roti in it.  There were only 2 roti, but it was fine by us because we used the remaining curry on the chicken rice.  You might order additional roti if you like.

2) This brought the discussion to the Singapore Chicken Rice.  Firstly, the chicken rice was adequately flavourful.  The chicken looked falling away on the plate.  This is usually because the chicken is overcooked.  Yet the meat was tender and not overcooked when I ate it.  I then realized the reason.  The kitchen deboned the chicken!  They put the pieces back together on the plate, making it looked like a regular chicken dish.  So much labour was put in it.  The chicken tasted okay.  The spicy dipping sauce was wonderful.  The portion of both the rice and chicken was generous.  For $7.50, this dish is a deal!

3) The Appetizer Platter had 3 pieces of each items: chicken satay, beef satay, vegetable spring rolls and fish cakes.  The satays were even better than the last time I had them.  They were really tender.  The flavour was strong, though not as strong as Gourmet Malaysia's satay.  The fish cake was well made, though I am used to a more spicy version.  I enjoyed them very much anyway.  I am never a fan of spring rolls, so the spring rolls tasted average to me.  Special personal bias go to how not oily everything was.

Overall, really good food at a really good price.  The Singapore Chicken Rice is the best I have had in York Region for a long time.  The services was more down-to-earth or less pretentious than before.  The wait staffs are no longer the \"pleasing to the eyes\" type but more down to earth.  I don't know for sure, but I won't be surprised if there is a change in management or at least a change in operation direction."}
{"text":"Satay was yummy.  Pulled coffee drink (can't remember the name) was ok."}
{"text":"The Toronto metro area does not have a shortage of Malaysian restaurants but few serve food like Restoran Malaysia. Every time when I come here, I have to order some sweet sour gulai dishes with calamari or prawns because it is a delicacy that I can't find else where. I am also a fan of their roti canai, which tasted like it was made fresh from scratch, udang masak asam, rendang, char kuey teow and hokkien mee. The teh tarik was also excellent and I had fun looking at how the tea is being pulled. While the flavours were great, the prices were a bit steep, especially for the drinks. $5 for ginger honey tea! Really? I also noticed that they were trying to include items which are not typically Malaysian like Singaporean laksa and pad thai. It is by no means wrong but if you're going to call it Restoran Malaysia, I hope to see a truly authentic Malaysian menu."}
{"text":"It's the second time I've been here but this time I really got the chance to enjoy my food and order what I wanted. I opted for the Coconut curry (does not come with rice), the Indonesian fried rice and Penang char kuay teow. 

I typically don't eat spicy however I gave everything a shot as is and it was just amazing. We shared our meals to sample every dish and the only thing my party and I agreed on is the fact that the coconut curry did not have much/any coconut taste to it at all.

Price is very reasonable for the portion and there is such a variety to the menu. I often hear comparison between this place and Thai Basil across the street and I have to say other than the curry at Restoran Malaysian, the two are pretty neck and neck. Both a win in my opinion."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular... But still a quality meal. It definitely was not worth the price, given that the portion sizes have reduced significantly in the past year, and the experience wasn't overly remarkable. 

Ordered the stir fried rice noodles, yellow chicken curry, vegetarian basil eggplant, oxtail soup, green mango salad, and pineapple chicken fried rice.

Rice noodles - bland but well priced. Good for people who don't like Malaysian spices but a decent meal. 

Vegetarian basil eggplant - typical. Really liked how it wasn't very oily compared to other restaurants. 

Oxtail soup - best of all the dishes order. Rich and flavourful

Yellow chicken curry - really don't think any restaurant can mess up this dish. 

Green mango salad - could not even taste the mango

Pineapple chicken fried rice - typical. 

Food was served quickly, wait staff were patient, but it was difficult getting their attention. 

The restaurant is very spacious and has a majestic vibe to it. 

Really didn't like how carbs were separate from the dishes... Can easily mislead customers into overpaying."}
{"text":"I didn't realize how much I missed Malaysian food until I came here. There were always good Malaysian options where I grew up in NYC and a lack of options in Seattle where I spent 7 years. We started off with the green mango salad, which I didn't like as much. We also had roti and yellow curry with chicken. The roti was nice and toasted but soft. The curry was delicious. We also had the wat tan ho, which was really good but surprisingly spicier than the curry. There is plenty of seating indoors, but a reservation is recommended for weekend evenings."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but they cut back on inclusions like veggies and meat in their dishes and started accepting cash only.  I'm sorry if you don't accept credit card or debit these days, you clearly are not in touch with the times.

This place went downhill fast, from one of my favs in the area to worst. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favourite restaurants in the GTA.

The food here is amazing, make sure to try the following dishes:

- Beef / Steak skewers with cucumber and house sauce or dip
- Indonesian Fried Rice 
- Deep Fried Chicken Bites or Pieces
- Chicken or Beef Curry with lots of Naan! 

Before you leave, if you still have room for it ask for their Malaysian style coffee that's made specially and not coming out of a machine.

No reservations for this place so if you're going for dinner, make sure to arrive early or put your name on the wait list."}
{"text":"I don't know if the food is authentic Malaysian or not; (I am not a Malaysian connoisseur) but we had a great experience. We came for dinner on Saturday night, restaurant was packed but we got seated within 5mins. Staff were friendly and food arrived quickly. 
Food was full of flavour; I liked the Penang noodles (thick rice noodles with eggs and shrimps), and chicken curry with roti. Food tastes so much better than the descriptions on the menu.

I can't wait to return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"We come here every so often, thus this was not our first time.

To start we had the seafood Tom Yam soup which was definitely fresh with 2 shrimps, 2 REAL scallops, 2 pieces of squid and tomato. A Thai delicacy that we throughly enjoyed. For our mains, we had the pineapple fried rice which comes with shrimp and shredded chicken and chopped of pineapple pieces! Very tasty!

We also had the Malay Kari (coconut curry) with chicken and fresh roti! Their roti is thin and never dry, if not a tiny tiny bit raw but we liked that! Haha. The curry was very tasty, not too spicy or salty. Finally, we got some garlic fried Chinese broccoli to have some veggies - excellent as well!

For a drink we got water and one mango-lychee freezy (smoothie). We both can confidently say that this is the best of its kind and nobody makes a mango lychee smoothie like they do.

Everything we had and more we recommend.
Service was prompt, food came quickly, and they even pack your leftovers for you!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. It is spacious and clean.  It is one of the few places that me and my friends keep going. The wat tan ho and chicken roti are what we always get. They have the best roti in town!! yum yum.. Recently I tried the Singapore laksa and it became another of my favorite. 

There are a few things I would avoid:
1. Hainanese chicken rice. It is not great. Phoenix restaurant has the best hainanese chicken rice in Toronto. 
2. The milk tea. It tastes good but super strong!! I had two sips at dinner time and it kept me awake till 6am in the morning."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!! I had the most AWFUL experience at this restaurant. The waiter that was serving us was so RUDE and demanded that me and my boyfriend must order two things on the menu and cannot share our meal (the meals are huge and can be shared by two people). I would understand if the restaurant was packed but it was completely empty. We asked if we could order our meal first and then choose a dessert after our meal and she said that we couldn't do that and we had to order both things at the same time. After we asked to speak to the manager she revealed that she was the manager. She then told the owner (I believe it was the owner) about us and I could see them clearly pointing at our table and talking about us. This obviously made us feel so UNCOMFORTABLE and is so inappropriate and UNPROFESSIONAL."}
{"text":"Restoran Malaysia is my go-to place for reliable and always delicious Southeast Asian food. Their version of Pad Thai is my absolute favourite! I just can't get enough of it! In addition, their curry roti and Singaporean Chicken rice are consistently excellent. This place doesn't take reservations, so go early to avoid a wait!

{"text":"Been enjoying the owner's cooking for over 20 years now. Absolutely love this place. The closest thing to authentic Malay and Singaporean food in Toronto. Some dishes taste better than the real deal out East."}
{"text":"Penang Char Kuay Teow with  coconut rice is a perfect combo! Lots of big shrimps, plus veggies like eggplants, okra, etc. Yummy. The curry is not so hot, but very tasty!!!
Love their food! And service is also very fast. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for a meal with my bestie from elementary school.

From the parking lot, it looks packed. The restaurant inside was quite spacious.

We tried the typical fried noodle and Malaysian Fried rice. The flavours are authentic and portions are plenty.

Stand out was the Malaysian Tossed Ice Tea. It was sweetened, smooth and creamy."}
{"text":"I found the restaurant quite noisy. It wasn't totally packed but to hold a conversation I almost felt like I had to yell across the table to be heard by the other person. FYI, this is a cash only establishment.

The Malay curry was spicy but not very flavourful. The chicken was quite dry and the chip that comes with it was soggy and not crisp. The pineapple fried rice had a nice sweetness to it but there weren't very many pieces of pineapple, chicken or shrimp. Perhaps they could put a few more pieces on and take away from the mound of rice that they give."}
{"text":"Not my first time here.  I came here years ago when I first moved into the area and they were one of the only places in town.  Have been here very occasionally.
One thing is certain, the menu hasn't changed - prices have but not the book itself.  It was tattered and torn and EW!
Ordered the Roti/Curry - still one of the better versions that I've had.  The roti isn't overly buttered but the curry could be a little thicker.  The Flat Noodle - Penang fried kuay teow - was overall tasteless and we couldn't finish it.  The Chicken Sambal - this I liked - lots of flavour and some heat!  And the Garlic Choy Sum - Kang Kong was out yet again - I don't think they ever had it.
Overall, a disappointing take it or leave it 2.5.  I guess I now remember why we came here so infrequently.
Maybe next time we come back, their menu's would be less EW!  Check out my pix on it and see if I am exaggerating!
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Really tasty food and can't beat prices.  BRING CASH! They don't take debit or credit so something to keep in mind.  We went for lunch and ordered the chicken and beef satay.  A MUST order! Chicken was my favourite and their homemade sauce to go with it is out of this world!  We also had a vegetarian Dahl with roti.  The roti was so fresh and delicious dish.  During lunch, have great deals so be sure to take advantage of that.  Portions are substantial."}
{"text":"So I went back for dinner and got to try a few more dishes. Chicken roti was delish (roti fresh and crispy). Beef satay skewers were juicy and flavourful. Laksa is labelled as being spicy but is a manageable level for most, like a spicier \"medium\". Only downside is that the restaurant does not serve alcohol!"}
{"text":"Have been to the place over 100 times. Went there for iftar (break our fast). The wait was 25 minutes to get seated. I asked the manager to let us order while we waited. She refused. I tried to explain to her the we have 3 kids 9, 11 & 13 who were fasting and very extremely hungry. Although this is a \"Halal\" restaurant. And of all people they should understand iftar BUT the girl was very rigid inner \"rules\". Long story short, we got our food 15-20 minutes after iftar. Not coming back to so called Muslim restaurant again."}
{"text":"I totally understand the pull that everybody has to Restoran Malaysia considering our lack of mainstream Malay/Indo restaurant scene.  I'm also putting a disclaimer that I might be biased because I'm Indonesian and get a chance to eat this type of food regularly :) On with the review!

I went here twice for dinner in the past few months, first as a large group of 30 ppl (poor waitresses did a good job taking care of us all) and then as a group of 4 people, both times sharing the entire meal.  I hadn't gone there in a looong time till this year.  I still remember this place when it was a hole in the wall, before they expanded the restaurant and totally reno'd the place!

We tried a whole range of items: laksa, roti, fried chicken, nasi goreng, bami goreng, lamb curry, fish, rendang... I liked the laksa, which was a huge bowl, pretty rich from the coconut milk and flavourful.  I also really loved the fish.. which I can only guess was the hot and spicy sambal version because it was HOT and I loved that. The fish had good texture and the sauce.. I would drink it. Or if I had rice, I'd completely soak it in sauce and eat that. The roti is great for soaking up sauce, but $2 for one piece of roti is a bit much.  

In the end, we each ended up paying close to $30, no alcohol involved. I think several of their dishes are overpriced. I would only come here again if my friend absolutely HAD to come here, otherwise, I could think of other places I could go to for half the price and enjoy just as much."}
