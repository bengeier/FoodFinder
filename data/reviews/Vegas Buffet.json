{"text":"This is not the same Vegas Seafood buffet in Los Angeles! Wish it is though. But it is a budget buffet with lots of selections n a bit better than the nearby China Star buffet."}
{"text":"What a HUMILIATING experience. Decided to stop by for a quick bite for dinner, paid the price and we were seated immediately. My father and I were headed to get some crab, before my father could get a piece a lady rushes up to us and tells us that it is \"dinner only\". We were confused, we paid the dinner price and the lady kept on demanding on telling us that it was dinner only. We calmly asked her to double check as we felt humiliated as the rest of the 5 customers in the entirety of the restaurant heard EvERYTHING. When she found out, she admitted her mistake. However, the awkward experience overall still haunts me and my father. Yikes."}
{"text":"Visited this buffet restaurant three times between December 15 and 22nd 2014, once for dinner and twice lunch. I found their food excellent, lot of choices to pick 
from, they brought fresh food in constantly. I don't understand often the negative comments people sometimes have on restaurants that are completely unwarranted in my opinion. Sometimes I wonder if they are objective or just wants to air some grievance and write negative. There are dozens of choices, try to tell me nothing was good at all. About food being cold, no idea when that was because every time I had a problem taking photo's due to the hot steam under the tray to keep the food warm!!    
I tried the hibachi/grill food too, picked some simple ingredients and the end result was not bad at all. Only thing I don't understand is the jar for tips there.

The service was excellent whenever my wife and I were there. If the food there was so bad then I wonder why Chinese travel agencies from China end up there with their tourist in busloads!! I have eaten in most of the hotels on the strip for buffet and laying out $30-$60 a person for a buffet, but this restaurant with their prices doesn't have to hold their head down for the quality of their food, so they have no Italian,American or Mexican food, it's Chinese buffet and they compare damn good with the other. I'm not from Las Vegas, I have traveled and eaten all over the world so it's not that I'm not able to compare restaurants, in fact I keep a small special notebook with me where I put the business cards in and write my opinion about service and food. If they have a takeout order sheet I take that too just to compare different restaurants and their prices.I gave them 4 stars and not 5 due to the fact that each restaurant can have an improvement somewhere, somehow, of the hundreds of restaurants that I visited there are maybe a handful that have the 5 stars.

I have to do a correction here, as mentioned everything was fantastic except it seems I have to agree with Travis B. concerning the rice, I did not eat the white rice, eat it every day at home so why should I have it in a restaurant, my wife however had it and she informed me that the rice was sticky and burnt, poor quality of rice."}
{"text":"I've been to many buffets. I've eaten some pretty amazing food. I've also eaten some pretty garbage food. 

This food is top tier garbage. This is Vegas. Please do not waste your money at this trainwreck of a restaurant while a wealth of amazing food exists elsewhere."}
{"text":"A very simple buffet place in Vegas with a good price. I can't say the food quality is good, but consider what you pay for, it is ok. (We went for weekday lunch for 7.99 per person +tax). The best thing I had there today is the freshly made seafood noodle soup- the soup is hot enough and not too salty, which I like a lot."}
{"text":"First of all I had a chocolate moose thing and it had a FINGER NAIL in it. Their buffet is pretty cheap but now I know why. The server was not paying any attention and it was not busy at all. The service was terrible. I will never be going back.  The Bathrooms Were NOT CLEAN AND YOU CAN SEE THROUGH All the stalls! Also when I went to use the restroom one of the servers went to the restroom she DIDN'T WASH HER HANDS! This place is dirty!! Stay far away!!"}
{"text":"Good selection of seafood dishes, mostly Asian dishes.
Clean dining room, friendly staff, good service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Just stopped by here today... must I warn you... EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK. this buffet location is the worst I've ever had. They're serving raw chicken... health hazard much? I guess you get what you pay for. I mean... even 13-15/person isn't worth it..

Please try elsewhere. This location needs to be shut down. Health department needs to really investigate this restaurant. Yuck!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible! Service was meh. The food was tired and old. Broccoli was brown and wet and the chicken that went with it was sour. The pork chops were crisp because they were so tough. The pizza was limp and doughy. Overall, $13 was far too much to pay for this shitty food. Stay away!!"}
{"text":"Very dissapointed. Was impressed by the decor but the food is very second rate. It might play in a midwest city but not here. Lots of variety but the quality sucked.  The orange chicken was cold and swimming in sauce. The sushi was well, horrible. Fired chicken under done. If they put as much effort into thier food as they do the appearance it could be a great joint. Also the waiter stood next to my booth texting."}
{"text":"YES ITS CHEAP AND THE OTHER ENTREES ARE ALRIGHT BUT IF YOU'RE COMING HERE FOR THE CRAB, DON'T!!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! The crab is soaked in water and literally tastes like plastic. It's a shame because we even told the manager and they grabbed some crab from the kitchen and it was the same Result. Also the servers are pretty rude. Just a horrible overall experience"}
{"text":"i really enjoyed the crab legs and the service is great ! the hostess Zou is a real  sweetheart she came to my table to let me know she just put out a hot tray of crab legs. so i piled my plate up again my bill with a soda was only $14.40 i highly recommend dining here"}
{"text":"I was really hesitant yesterday to try out this place. Made me step back and move my feet forward then step back again just because I am not familiar with it but I have this goal to try out every food places as much as I can so why not go for it and experience it. Overall, I was kinda impressed!! There was a lot of food selection and everything I got was really good except for the crab legs which I am not really a fan of it so it was okay for me. Servers were really attentive and the price is right!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, but the service from the manager was horrible. I had lunch there and was
double charged so I informed the manager name Kiki and she was very rude after I explain to her
that I have  my receipt and my friends receipt and that I was over charged. The manager ask for my number and said she will call me back and hung up on me. When she called back she said she can not refund my money but she will give me a free lunch pass. I informed her that was not ok and she said that is the best she can do. I informed her I will call my bank and I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"This is the worst buffet i have ever been to. All the food was cold,  3 of the plates that i picked up were discussing! It took about 10 minutes for are drinks to get to the table, but that time we had already tasted the food and were looking forward to are drinks to wash down the horrible tast. We decided to just try the fruit and deserts but even the fruit was bad. The ice cream was ok, but how hard is that to mess up. Our stomachs are uneasy since we left. We just hope we dont get food poisoning.
______________________________
Its the next day and i just wanted to keep this updated. My boyfreind was up most of the night with a horrible stomach ache. I didnt get it as bad but still has a upset stomach. 
Needles to say we will not be returning nor will we ever recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Service was decent. Their food, not so much. Although their lunch buffet was under $9 (as of May 2017), it was not good at all. Food options were limited with mediocre quality. Some main entrees were not warm at all and most were greasy and/or bland.

If you're looking for some cheap buffet places to eat and don't care about food quality, this is the place. If you are expecting good food, look elsewhere as you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The food is terrible the service is terrible. The lady that checks you in couldnt even open the register to give me change. Dont eat here you can tell its filthy in the back and the guy eho makes the sushi and soup was just a dick with a terrible attitude."}
{"text":"I've visited this buffet 3 times since its first opening, when it opens, the food was made fresh...when we came back the second and third time, the food looked soggy and dry. It looked like it has been sitting there for a while. The service was poor! The front desk girl wasn't friendly. She has more of an attitude and wasn't helpful. The money we paid for wasn't worth the price they charge for. The food looked disgusting!"}
{"text":"I'm heading to the Vegas Buffet this AM as I am in the need of a fish fix. Great baked Salmon, great Coconut Shrimp, great Fried fish, the best French Fries around and so many other things to eat. If your from the North east you'll love the spiced Steamer clams."}
{"text":"Do not expect too much for the price. Although I was suprise with the variety of food on the buffet tables. I like the fried shrimp and the crab legs."}
{"text":"The food was actually quite nice: beef and broccoli (thickish sauce on it..ok), Sweet n Sour Chicken (quite tasty), Satay sticks (chicken was delicious), Fried Shrimp (fresh and tasty), BBQ rib (wasn't cooked that day..tasted of fridge), clams (add salt), fries (cold and stale), fried plaintains (very chunky and delicious), frozen yogurt (yummy), fried rice (tasty), creamy orange salad (tasty), cucumber salad (black pepper/lemon/salt on it, nice), fried chicken wings (ok, tasty enough), Cali Roll (nice, not dry), fried fish fillets (yummy). Good service too. Very casual place with booth seating etc."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Lee's Buffet because it's close to my job and I was craving sushi so today was the day.  Lee's has a big, clean room with 4 small rows of selections plus a sushi section.  The sushi rolls were o.k. and pretty fresh, better than supermarket sushi but of course not as good as a top sushi restaurant.  I also liked the marinated musrooms and cucumbers.  The mongolian beef had very chewy beef, I didn't want to try the beef & broccoli beef but did get the broccoli and it had a pretty good flavor. They were constantly refreshing the dishes which was good to see.  They had several different Chinese dishes, plus onion rings, fries and pizza which was weird but my intention was to not pig out today so I didn't try everything.  The server was super quick and friendly and removed plates and refilled water quickly.  They had a fruit and dessert station and frozen yogurt which I also didnt try but didnt look too special.

The only thing I didn't like that almost makes me not want to go back is the rude hostess.  When I went to pay my check she snatched the $10 bill out of my hand. I thought maybe that was an accident, but when I gave her another $10 and asked for change to leave the server a better tip, she did it again!  When she gave me change she didnt say a word or make eye contact, no 'thank you,' no 'come again' and definitely no 'have a nice day!'  Someone tell this young twit customer service is everything, and businesses come and go in this area!  Overall, for $8.55 lunch if you're craving a sushi roll but dont want to spend a lot and if you want some variey give it a try!"}
{"text":"How do you mess up rice? 
Seriously, you're an Asian buffet.

Most of the food was not very good. The one exception being the delicious coconut shrimp 

My spoon was dirty and so were 2 of the plates I picked up.

Very cheap price but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The AC didn't work, food was dried, the used to have a better selection on seafood. They don't have  fried noodles anymore. They don't crab legs anymore, food was disgusting. U guys need to improve the menu."}
{"text":"Most food was dry and taste was bad.
Steam crab legs were too salty. Sushi was only rolls and taste was horrible.

Money u paid for cheap meal($13) was what u had. 
No wonder there were only two tables on sat night.

Lunch Buffect at Buffect Asia is much better & cheap."}
{"text":"It bills itself as a seafood buffet. There is some seafood, some basic sushi (mostly the \"rolls\"), pizza and such. Quite a few varieties of seafood though and the price is only $9.20 for lunch. Watch the Val-pack envelope in the mail for the 15% off. They start serving dinner (more expensive) at 4pm. I was just leaving but I noticed that for dinner they put out some kind of large roast, some crab legs (not split), and I do not know for sure what else. Lunch was good and the price includes a soft drink"}
{"text":"Do not come here! Below average and should definitely NOT be called \"vegas\" buffet. The staff had no people skills, the food was not replenished....they didn't show us to a table as apparently is their procedure. After paying, we found our own seating, but apparently we sat in the wrong area. They had the nerve to ask if we paid. It was the servers fault that he didn't do his tasks. This place is an insult to the legend of Vegas buffets. The worst Asian buffet I've ever been to.... and I'm very experienced.Do walk across the road to Blueberry Hill!!!!"}
{"text":"Great options to pick from, I love the seafood. They had a great selection of seafood and a lot of different desserts to pick from. The sushi bar has a great variety to pick from. They have great coupons and the prices are very good! Service was fine. The cleanliness of the bathrooms wasn't very good, I'd suggest using the restroom before you come to eat there. The make your own stir fry bar is neat but doesn't have that many options."}
{"text":"This place was a joke!! A waste of time and money. Unfriendly staff. Limited selection of food for a buffet.  Food served cold. Crab legs were thin and tasteless. Everything about this place was horrible. I will never return or recommend this buffet."}
{"text":"I come here often now since they are under new management. If it was under the old management, I would have never stepped a foot in this place again, but I'm glad I did. They have a very large variety of food. Even sushi. Sure, its not 5 star, but its up there. For around 10$ a person, Its not bad. Very clean place. The only thing that I dislike is that their drinks taste a bit weird, so I always bring my own water. The staff is... normal, nothing over the top. This is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Much better then what i expected.,  the inside needs a little TLC but food was good. on weekends they have all you can eat HUGE oysters and the crab legs were never ending and fresh.  they even have a build it yourself wok station which was my fav part.... for the price you cant go wrong!!1"}
{"text":"I would say this place deserves a 2 star because their food quality isn't that great, their clams taste like sea water and their wonton soup doesnt even taste like wonton soup ): but the customer service was not too bad compared to the buffet @ Asia on eastern . The price range per person here is $13 so in my opinion it's actually not worth it, Go somewhere else that's worth your money and food quality is good"}
{"text":"You get what you paid for! Don't expect anything special regarding the food because you will surely get very disappointed! The food does not look fresh and taste is at best average. Dried out food and very suspect sushi rolls. Service is not any better! The restaurant is not very clean, trash all over the place."}
{"text":"This place was gross worst customer service  will never be going to this place ever again. I Now see the reason they got shut down and then had to change the name  plus I feel like I just got food poisoned"}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!! This is the worst so called buffet I've ever been to. We saw an ad on a Chinese news paper with great pics and discount, but when we got there nothing was true! There was no discount and the crab leg wasn't there a lot of empty trays under the hot lamp and the employees had a whole lot of bad attitude!! They try to tell us that the ad was old but the news paper was brand new and they told us that they are not responsible for what the news paper had printed. What a joke."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE! Bad bad!! The food wasn't all great the best thing was probably the white rice and the grapes that the fruit salad bar had. I will never come back! EVER. And the service was horrible. I swear I had like 4 dirty plates that never got picked up and I wasn't able to get a water refill because all the servers were too busy talking!! The sushi.... Was ok. Not the best. I would give it a 2 out of 10.. The place wasn't ugly but the service and the not so good food killed it... IF the service would have been better maybe the food wouldn't have tasted so bad. I would seriously just walk out and leave and NOT pay... But I parked too far to run out! Don't come here."}
{"text":"I do not come here! Sticks for sushi should ask. no cups for ice cream! Sushi just disgusting. it is the worst sushi I have ever eaten. sushi with mayonnaise and very spice hot!"}
{"text":"Very bad experience. There wasn't much of a buffet. The place was 80 degrees and top it off there were 5 buses of tourists. One child (about 12) stood at the desserts and eating off of everything or picking it up, smelling it and putting it back. When we complained to management, they didn't say anything to her. The ice tea smelled like sewer water. Ever since they changed management, it has gone down hill."}
{"text":"Good place to grad a lunch , not bad for the price i like that it include see food ,meat,fruits and sweets. I like going there for lunch 2-3 times a week. I would deffenetly recomend it if you dont want to pay more then 15$"}
{"text":"Just like the other buffet places like Buffet at Asia... I like it because of the seafood they have.... Not too bad for the price, about $13.00 per person. Not a fancy place though but I like it. Been here about 3 times now..."}
{"text":"We were there yesterday. The food was less than average, the price, very cheap, but it was dirty. The restrooms were very dirty. They really don't care. I will not come back."}
{"text":"Just ate there...a/c not working, very,very hot inside. Food ok for the price, employees dony smile or speak...maybe it is an English issue...go tp Buffet Asia, much better...remember, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!!cheap=CHEAP"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Below mediocre food, attitudes and dirty utensils/cups. My stomach is turning flips now. Thanks"}
{"text":"Absoloutely horrible. The host was sitting outside on the trash can. Plucked her wedgy when she got up. We found food in our hair. No one apologized or said a word when we complained they just said no English. The food was very old and bland. Just sitting there for hours. They gave me one price on the phone and a different one when we got there"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2.5stars from my experience.
The buffet did not have a great selection and typical Asian buffet to me. Nothing special nor amazing. It's a open cafeteria place setting and good for a big party with very cheap price for lower your party budget but not for the quality Vegas food. Only $1 difference between the other buffet on the same street. Others has way better quality with reasonable price. Just once was enough for me."}
{"text":"The food was cold. Maybe have to get there at opening time. Not the worst, but I would much rather go to Krazy Buffet."}
{"text":"I think the reviews are a bit harsh overall. I ate the lunch buffet on a weekday. It was very cheap, about $10 with a drink. The food was refreshed often and some of it was actually pretty good (bbq pork chops, soups). The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated, however the tvs didn't work so we couldn't watch the NCAA basketball games. 

This place isn't going to win any foodie awards, but if you have a family and want a decent place to grab some food, it fits the bill."}
{"text":"This was formerly Lee's Buffet and before that it was New China Buffet.It has had many name changes but ,unfortunately,the food seems to continuously remain the same quality.They claim to be under new ownership but the food seems to be suspiciously similar,if not virtually identical,to what used to be served at Lee's Buffet.I ate lunch here on October 22 and it wasn't real bad;there are other Chinese buffets worse than this.The problem is it wasn't real great either.If distance and travel time weren't factors,there are definitely other buffets I would choose before this one.As always,Krazy Buffet on Sahara and Cimarron comes to mind.It is my favorite Chinese buffet in Las Vegas.But back to the newly named Vegas Buffet.I hope they don't fall into the same pattern of repeated health code violations that constantly seem to plague this restaurant regardless of it's name.I wish them luck but the health inspectors will be keeping a VERY close eye on this place based on their past history.I guess only time will tell.Good luck,Vegas Buffet."}
{"text":"I first ate here when it was Lee's Buffet and wasn't overly impressed. Then it closed down for some violations, but I went back after it reopened....and still wasn't that impressed. When it closed again, I just shook my head. But it reopened as the Vegas Buffet and after a few months, I got curious. So I had lunch there today. It is an acceptable Asian Buffet, much like Krazy Buffet and Buffet of Asia. What will bring me back here are the cucumber salad, the potato salad, and the banana bread pudding. The cucumber salad was tasty, but not too tart. The potato salad was simple with nice big chunks of potato and just enough dill sauce. And the banana pudding had small chunks of crunchy bread and a dollop of whipped cream--yummy!"}
{"text":"Horrible service horrible staff food was nasty and crab legs no flavor I prefer my l.a for my Chinese food never again coming here !"}
{"text":"Disgusting!!!!!
We got there last night for a late dinner. Had been there before for brunch and it was ok, nothing special but ok. Last night was terrible!!!

We had the feeling to eat leftovers. The food had been standing on the buffet for hours I guess because most of it was stuck on the plates, very dry, so dry.... Looking not nice and not tasty at all either. The chow mein had no flavor and was over-cooked, fried rice looked like regular white rice, almost nothing in it. Even the simple French fries (yes you have to be in America to have fries, pizza etc on a Chinese buffet!) were so dry that we couldn't even chew them.  

Even the fortune cookies were strange. We all got the same message saying \"you need a second fortune go on www.SecondFortune.com\" LOL!

Staff was barely friendly moping the floor while we were eating. No idea of customer service and respect I presume....!

Conclusion : Forget this place !!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to taste a Vegas buffet and ended up here because it was cheaper than the ones on the strip. 

The buffet did not have a great selection and the food was so bland. There was nearly no meat on the crab legs.  You get what you pay for. So if you are looking for cheap buffet good this is a mediocre option."}
{"text":"Was out and about, looking for a quick bite when I saw that the once-defunct Lee's Buffet was now open as Vegas Buffet.  Price was very reasonable at $7.99 for lunch, so I took chance.  When all was said and done, I think I finally found the worst dining experience in Las Vegas.

Service is not really non-existent, it is clueless.  The owner-manager, a middle-aged woman, was hardly at the front counter, so a wait is involved even when you are the only one in line.   You then have the pleasure of hearing her berating staff anywhere in the restaurant, in loud Chinese.  Even one of the cooks who is clearly Hispanic came in for a withering chastisement from her holiness.  I first went to the men's room, to wash up, only to discover no paper towels.  I mentioned this to THREE employees, including the manager-yeller and by the time I departed... still no towels.  In fact, when I informed her highness of this lack of drying supplies, her reply was, \"Oh, that's ok.\"  Clearly a Rhodes Scholar.  In fact, throughout my meal, she was glued to the floor, literally standing next to me, loudly castigating someone.  When I finally turned to her and asked, sarcastically, \"I'm not bothering you, am I?\"  She replied, \"No.\"  A waiter got the message and motioned for her to move.  She was back within 5 minutes.

While the service is abysmal, the food is atrocious.  Cold.  Watery.  Mislabeled, if labeled at all.  When the best dish on a multi-offering buffet are fried desert noodles, something is terribly wrong.  I started with the sushi, which was surprisingly a notch above mediocre.  The tempura item, whatever it was, as there was no label, was another pleasant surprise.  Considering its location just across the street from the vaunted Yama Sushi, whose lunch buffet, with tax, is a shade above $22, one could conceivably make a decent meal here from the cold-rice offerings.  There is a Mongolian barbecue station adjacent to the sushi, but no one ever came to the counter to take an order.  

From the hot buffet:  Astringent \"stuffed\" crabs, the size of  a Ritz cracker, which, coincidentally, may be its main ingredient.  Mongolian Beef was spongy and chewy to the extreme.  Fried items were hit and much miss.  Mini Spring Rolls were less than lukewarm and flavorless, while the cream cheese-filled wontons were passable, but just barely.  Skewers of over-done, roasted chicken breast were surprisingly flavorful, if tough and dryer than a good Champagne.  Shrimp in many guises were competent but not memorable.  The ghastly, artificially-yellow egg drop soup was salt-free, though not labeled as such.  And the pork chop was that in name alone, as there was no discernible flavor in any bite.

The deserts are as wanting as anything else, save for the crispy noodles baked in some type of honey/sweet sauce and covered with sesame.  The 'ice cream' - and I am being generous here in my phraseology -  was less creamy than a hard avocado.  The filled cake roll, whose middle was unidentifiable was stale, and the banana pudding should have been left in the box in which the mix came.

Came time to check out, the loud manager never once asked how things were, nor did she offer a thank you.  I thanked her plenty by informing a carload of visiting out-of-staters who were deciding where to eat to brave the line at Yama, or, better yet, hit McDonalds.  At least you know what your getting, in advance.

Vegas Buffet's website is another indicator of their less than stellar service philosophy, as no link works and the prices listed are different than those in-store.  While I will agree with their touting their prices as \"one third\" of those on the Strip, I would take umbrage at their usage of the word \"Enjoy.\""}
{"text":"I guess  I got lucky ;/  Clean, got seated, got served right away. I tried to find the hot food that was cold... but could not?  Same for the dirty plates? Nice Americanized Chinese buffet. Good selection of sushi. This won't be my last time here."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place, I looking for something to eat after work and close to the airport and this place was close by so I thought I would come here and try it out. First I could only pay in cash which is bad because I only have ten dollars in cash. The food is below average not a big selection of food. I recommend a place called hibachi grill on Nellis and Stewart best Asian buffet I've been to . To sum things up this place is yuck!"}
{"text":"** Under New Management ** as of November 2015.

Lunch is $7.95 and Dinner & All Day Sunday is $11.95.

This is my first time dining at this restaurant and overall I was impressed with the place.  There was a wide range of seafood and 9 sushi dishes to choose from and traditional Chinese food.  The place was clean.  I spoke to the new Owners and they were wonderful to deal with.

At $7.95 for lunch this is great value and I'll be back."}
{"text":"In a city filled with so many wonderful buffets, they are overpriced compared to the local casinos and the food is just so so... Not a fan of sticky tables either..."}
{"text":"Not a very good experience food looks old and doesn't taste very well. Only things that were decent were the food that was not prepared by the reasturant. 1st and last visit."}
{"text":"I visited this place for lunch and dinner, they have a nice variety of food, the soups are really good, but overall the quality of food is not the best. Its Ok for the price you pay, under $10 for lunch and $13 for dinner. But It would be much better for the restaurant to stay in business and attract more customers if they increase their rates by few dollars and improve the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Visited the place about 3 times in 3 months.  On the 3rd visit this place strikes out!   Parking lot has piles of trash, especially next to the fence of East side of parking lot. Each visit the piles have just grown larger.  Concern, the trash attracts roaches and rats.  Suggested a \"daily parking lot check\" with a broom and dust pan.  Owner/manager just looked at me as if I were an idiot.  Windows and blinds beyond filty. windows had a yellowish \" haze\" on them.  Blinds had a thick layer of dust and food on them.  Obviously, non-exsisting cleaning schedule.  Male bathroom had free standing urinal water under urinal.  Stall dividers were beyond filthy!

Ordered a \"ice tea\" from waiter.  When it was delivered I asked if it were ice tea or water.  The waiter said that a special tea is used that make it light in color...yea, right!  Staff overall unresponsive and unfriendly.  Will not visit this location again"}
{"text":"I was curious to see if anything had changed, since the previous poster said that the buffet was under new management.

I can't say I've noticed any differences.  The food is okay--nothing special, nothing wrong with it. Selection seems the same. The grill section was shut down, at least during lunch--they had dessert items in the trays.  Lunch price was $8.75 plus drink."}
{"text":"Drive by this place all the time and for the past 10 years or so they've had so many different names. Saw them on dirty dining for their infestation of rats, shut down by the health department. Just nasty."}
{"text":"Very good place food and customer service. Traditional Chinese food !"}
{"text":"Good selection of food. For the lunch buffet price of 7.99, it was pretty good value for the dollar. We paid the same price for hamburger combo. I  recommend the place for good variety of Chinese food."}
{"text":"This was a downgrade from Lees Buffet. Dinner was to start at 4:00PM, the crab legs, which we came for did not reach the line till 4:25P.M. The crab legs needed some salt when they heat them up, a little taste please.The roast beef they brought out to cut ourselves was tough, not a bad taste. The BBQ Beef ribs was very tough and the sauce they use is very different, not to my choosing.Some of the shrimp dishes were good, along with the stuffed clams. If your going to spend the money go to Asian Buffet on Flamingo and Eastern, I think they are a better chose for the money."}
{"text":"Typical Asian buffet. Nothing special or exciting. It was good, but nothing was amazing. It was clean, and they do a really good job at making sure all the food options are full and not empty or cold. It's super cheap, so we'll be back."}
{"text":"Was here just today. Had a good meal. Price isn't too bad. Weekends are a bit pricey for the food but over all it was worth it. Service was not that great. We didn't get a single refill the whole time we were there. Maybe next time I will shout for my refill. But over all the food was actually good. Sushi bar wasn't very good But it's not a sushi place. Only reason I didn't give it more stars was service. I think I only saw 2 people on the floor the whole time"}
{"text":"Great food, and low price. I didn't expect the service of a hotel buffet, and I don't know why some of others expect it when the prices are this low. This place has the same type of buffet items as anywhere else and some extra ones that they don't typically have without having to pay a premium. I showed up hungry and left full and satisified. If I wanted to be treated like a king, I'd be paying over 2, 3 times of the price at a high end place. And I always have that option to do so too."}
{"text":"I use to go there with my parents when it was Lee's Buffet. I have to say the food is a lot better. I went as soon as it opened for the day. Everything was fresh. The sushi was freshly made the main dishes were nice and hot. Great selection. I've lived in Vegas my whole life and I have definitely had my share in buffets. So when I say Vegas Buffet is a go too buffet I mean it. I've take plenty of guests here and they've all said the same. Will always come here when I'm in the area looking for food."}
{"text":"This is the most terrible buffet I have never seen it. First I went front pay for it , the lady she had horrible attitude and no smile. Second they called seafood buffet with snow crab legs but soon we sat down and they took out the crab legs , I went front asked the horrible lady where was crab lags and horrible lady said\" I wasn't work in the kitchen,asked who work in the kitchen.\"
This is very bad experience,so we are not come back again."}
{"text":"Any buffet that lays out the seafood is a GREAT buffet to me.  Just in case you are wondering, the lack of four star rating was based on service.

What I really liked about this place is that they kept the crab legs coming.  You eat 'em, they keep bringing 'em!  Same goes for their whole fried shrimp.  That being said, neither the crab legs or shrimp have any flavor other than what nature has intended.

I'm totally bummed I didn't see the Mongolian BBQ station until I had already filled my gut with all the other items they had.  Mainly because they offer shrimp in the Mongolian BBQ.  Now, this is a relatively small station with limited veggie and sauce choices but....SHRIMP!

I wasn't a fan of the baked salmon or the stuffed clam shells.  They both had a flavor of mayonnaise I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy. 

The sushi bar was small but decent.  No sashimi offered here but they will place the same pieces you'd get in sashimi form atop a small pinch of rice (you know, to fill you up). All the other rolls are some play on a California roll (some deep fried, sub cream cheese) ,etc.)

I wasn't told that a drink was included in the cost of the buffet so I was surprised when I was charged for one despite that I never ordered one, or was even offered one.  We asked for napkins three times and never received them (which, when dinning with children under age 5, c'mon, you know we needed those napkins)."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, food replenishment was slow... Large tourist crowd came in and we had to fight our way to the food only to find scraps. Hostess was rude, bathrooms were gross.... You could practically see through the stall doors... I will not be coming back...."}
{"text":"Came here because we were starving and the line for Yama was around the corner. We had been here when it was Lee's, but never returned. Husband was willing to give it another chance. We were both pleasantly surprised.

Great selection, from sriracha octopus to coconut shrimp. Limited sushi, a Mongolian grill-type section. Several soups, lots of desserts, and an all-fried section for you 'Mercans with limited palettes.

I found it clean, and the food hot. I don't eat rice, so can't speak to the issues with that. It is definitely better than it used to be.

Some dishes, like the Mongolian beef, were just so-so. Didn't find anything truly terrible. The green beans were fabulous - crispy and perfectly seasoned. Husband says salmon was amazing. Even the sushi wasn't bad. 

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Okay, i am going to warn you all before you read this review. This review may REALLY scare the crap out of you, and it has nothing to with Halloween coming up. Quite frankly-  this review should not be read anyone with young children nearby, or anyone with a heart condition. Let me just start with this : This restaurant was disturbingly bad. The food had basically no flavor and you could not even distinguish between what was supposed to be \"Asian\" food and something that was not even food at all. Okay, now as i warned you earlier... this is going to get REAL scary. However, i first must admit, that i took a complete chance on this place. I read nothing about it in advance. Our Uber driver simply said it was likely \"okay\". The simple fact is this , this was only place within a short walk to our final destination and my teenage son was really complaining about being hungry. We were going to the visit the Atomic Bomb museum. (that was worth going to) In retrospect, I now wonder if any old nuclear fallout impacted the owners judgement in cooking. FINAL WARNING: Read on at your own risk. After eating several very bland and very poorly tasting items, (including the white rice) I went to back up to the food warmers to see if i missed the one \"good\" tasting item. Much to my dismay, i nearly fell to the ground when i thought i saw what appeared to be tiny ducks hatching in the tray of hard boiled eggs. The white eggs were just slightly brown and were all crackled - kind of like that faux italian wallpaper or floor tile you find at Home Depot. Rather than touch the eggs or get any closer, i took a photo them. This appeared to be the most bizarre and nasty food of the Philippines. It is called Balut. Go to Wikipedia on your own time to learn more about it. I won't describe it beyond it's name. Suffice to say this, It is just totally and 100 percent completely gross. It is legally banned in numerous states and countries. Be afraid, be very afraid of it. It was even on the TV show Survivor years ago as a tribal challenge....and guess what.....the tribe members puked on it. Safe eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"Idk about the other reviews but the food is fabulous..very clean all around..not smelly either. So much to choose from. Love love love their choices?  Salt & Pepper Shrimp is good and large size!  Service us courteous too.."}
{"text":"I am here now and this is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. I am sure during the day when the food is fresh they are great. But at 9pm on a Wednesday the food was beyond old. It looks like the food has been sitting for legit days. All the food was cold. The temperature on the food can not be within a healthy limit, I felt all the platters and they were all barely being warmed, so I am actually concerned for anyone who would eat here. I am staring at my one plate and am just going to cut my losses and eat at Panda Express up the street. Please avoid at night. I pray a Heath inspector visits."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service. They are rude from the moment you walk in and could care less if you are eating here!  The food is okay but not worth the experience. Just drive on by and don't stop!!"}
{"text":"Ate here when it was Lee's buffet and hated it. Thought I'd try the new VEGAS buffet. While, it is clean, the food was terrible. My 4 year old didn't even like the rice, and he LOVES rice. Maybe I had a bad experience and I'm willing to try them again when it's a bit more busy."}
{"text":"Yes, I would come again in spite of the recent news posting; maybe every couple of months."}
{"text":"Terrible name. Vegas Buffet? Misleading, THIS IS AN ASIAN BUFFET! This is the same crap as LEES Buffet that was just there. This looks and tastes like the same as when it was THE NEW CHINA BUFFET before they remodeled. STAY AWAY! Go to BUFFET ASIA if you're looking for an ASIAN buffet. VEGAS BUFFET is not your typical buffet. 90% ASIAN food and a few american soft drinks."}
{"text":"The food is not great but where they truly succeed in failing is in customer service, decor, and cleanliness,  none of which do they have. One positive note, the sign they have for the restaurant is lovely."}
{"text":"Just your average, run of the mill, quantity but no quality, Chinese buffet.  Food was just food.  Not horrible but nothing special at all. Buffets are not my thing and it wasn't for my better half I would never visit one.  

The food is just uninspiring, boring and lifeless.  The space itself is clean and a lively array of customers was more enjoyable than the food."}
