{"text":"Friendly service and cheap, cheap, cheap prices!  My husband and I had 5 pupusas between the two of us, horchata, and an ensalada drink for a grand total of $16, including tip.  While I thought the pupusas were fine, though much cheesier than the ones I'm used to (from La Santaneca in SF), my husband proclaimed, \"They were bland!\"  I guess we will be continuing our search for comparable pupusas, though if I go by his standards, there are no other places that compare to his favorite restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"After reading so many raved reviews of Eliana's, my fat female friend and I decided to give this place a chance.  We went there pretty early, around 4:15pm on a Thursday.  No one was there except us, I hope it's because of the time. My friend commented it must be a front for some South American drug cartel.  Har har.   I ordered the Ensalada (fresh fruit drink) while FFF ordered the Tamarindo ( tamarind citrus drink).  The ensalada is a very sweet drink with thin slices of pear and another fruit I can't seem to tell from the taste.  FFF thought her Tamarindo was sweet at first, then agreed with me it sucked.  It was too sour for my taste buds.    After 2 or 3 minutes, our appetizers came.  My Pupusa ( tortilla stuffed with cheese, pork, refried beans and green bell peppers) came flaming hot.  It was very crispy and tasty, but hardly any traces of pork..  FFF's first reaction to the tamal ( Salvadorian style chicken tamales with vegetables) was a fake cheerful smile.  After 2 more bites, her real opinion surfaced.  Two thumbs down.  I tried it and thought it was ok.  I wouldn't order it, but would eat it if someone offer them to me for free.   Mama Carmen's tamales are still the best.   After the appetizers, our waitress brought us some soup and what looks like a cole slaw or salad.  It was hard to tell.  We both agreed the cole slaw wasn't good.  I'm not a fan of cole slaw so i can't  really compare it to others.  Our soup was served in a cup the size of a shot glass, the short shot glass.  It was similar to chicken noodle soup.  It was their best dish out of the whole meal.  This shouldn't have been their best dish.    The main course finally came and the first thing FFF said was 'the rice is uncle bens'.  I gave her a weird smirk.  Her fish was really small.  They brought out the Filete de Pescado a la Plancha ( fish fillet on the grill)  for her, but she really ordered the Mojarra Frita con Chimo ( fried fish and refried beans).  She was really excited to eat the fish eyes.  The fish was really disappointed,  It was dry and there wasn't any sauce.   I could have cooked better fish.  My Fajitas de Camaron con Pollo o con carne ( fajitas of shrimp and chicken with refried beans. My chicken was dry and the shrimp didn't have any flavor to them.  Applebee's fajitas was definitely better and that's not saying much.  The total bill came out to $32.39 which isn't bad.  We were disappointed with the food.  There wasn't much flavor to the food. The only nice compliment my friend had about the meal was it was a healthy.  Screw that!  If I wanted healthy, I'll go to subway or cypress pita grill.  This is my first review of many to come and it's starting off with a stinker.  Sorry folks."}
{"text":"This one is really hard.   Based on other Yelp reviews, I went to Eliana's to pick up lunch last week. It's close to my work, and it sounded like such a nice departure from my usual lunchtime rounds. This past weekend, my boyfriend and I went to dinner there, because I thought it deserved a second try. I'll tell you a little about both experiences.   After perusing all of the (mostly) helpful and honest reviews here, I really psyched myself out about giving it a try and just HAD to go there for takeout that VERY SAME DAY - I'm not a delayed gratification kind of person, despite my best efforts. I ended up at the restaurant at around 11:00, and it was empty. The lady behind the counter seemed a little frosty at first, but then she started in with calling me \"mija,\" and I was a goner. I'm not sure why, but some little, older lady calling me a term of motherly endearment always softens me right up.   I ordered the Pollo Encebollado, described in the menu only as \"chicken with onions.\" Hm. Well, I like chicken, and I like onions...so...that sounded pretty good! I was imagining something akin to an El Salvadorian fajita. As I picked up my order and drove back to work to enjoy it at my desk, visions of chunks of seasoned chicken and sauteed onions danced through my head. I settled down at my desk, took a deep breath, opened the nicely wrapped Styrofoam container, and...chicken on the bone? What? Who said anything about chicken on the bone? With some reddish, tomatoey-looking sauce? What is this? Where are the delicious, unauthentic strips of white meat chicken? The browned onions, all oily and slippery? THIS ISN'T FAJITAS!   Well, no. It isn't fajitas...fajitas are somewhere else on the menu. This is Pollo Encebollado, and I didn't know what I was ordering. Pollo Encebollado, at Eliana's, is two drumsticks covered in a flavorful, tomato-based sauce, paired with a few cooked onion slices. The meal includes rice, beans, and tortillas, but I went for double rice, which is kind of yellow in color and studded with chopped carrots and onions. The tortillas are like fat little pancakes that taste like tortillas, if that's not a completely ignorant description.   I don't generally eat chicken on the bone, but, hey. I ordered it, I was really wanting to try it, so I broke a personal rule and dove in. While it wasn't quite what I had imagined, I liked it well enough and was able to finish it.   I wasn't sure what to think. I wasn't too into it...definitely not enough to order that same thing again, but I didn't want to write Eliana's off completely, based merely on some weird, prissy, arbitrary issue I have with chicken on the bone.   I told my boyfriend about the restaurant, and suggested that we go try it out together. He had actually heard of it before from a Salvadorian coworker who raves about it frequently.  We went on a Friday evening at around 5:00...the restaurant was, again, nearly empty. A very friendly man seated us and took our drink orders.   I first tried the Orchata, which was very different from the Mexican variety I'm sure most of us are familiar with. It was actually a milky brown in color, rather than white...it looked, to me, like a glass of chocolate milk. The color, I found out later, comes from the addition of an ingredient called Morrow Seed. It also tastes a little different, in a way that is hard to explain...I'd also probably chalk that up to the Morrow Seed.   For our entrees, my boyfriend had the Chile Relleno, and I ordered the Arroz a la Valenciana...mostly because it is painted on the outside of the restaurant, and seems to be their \"hallmark\" dish.   Note: before your order arrives, you receive a salty little cup of chicken soup. I wasn't too into the soup itself, but I was oddly touched by the effort to add a little something extra and a little something nice to the dining experience. Maybe I'm a sappy weirdo. Well, not maybe, I definitely am, but between the \"mija\"s and the cute little soups, I felt very charmed by the man and woman working there, and really, really wanted to enjoy my food so I could write a big, long review on Yelp about how wonderful their restaurant is.   Neither my boyfriend or I really enjoyed either of our dishes. My dish was served cold, which I wasn't expecting, and seemed very flavorless to me...other than the unusual taste of bananas I seemed to pick up from the rice. The man helping us suggested that I pour the bean substance on my dish to \"create a new flavor.\" I thought this was also a really cute thing to say, but, unfortunately, I followed his advice and did not enjoy the \"new flavor\" I created. All in all, I enjoyed the Arroz a la Valenciana much less than the Pollo Encebollado.  Annnnd I'm out of characters. If you want to hear about the Chile Relleno or the Ensalada beverage, message me!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Everything was delicious and not at all greasy-tasting (which is unusually for foods like pupusas and friend plantains).  One of the best latin restaurants in AZ."}
{"text":"We ate at Eliana's based on reviews we had read.  Since we had to be at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport anyway, and, Eliana's was not far from the airport, we decided to have lunch.  It was wonderful and we highly recommend it.  Everyone was very friendly and the food was delicious.  There were 3 of us and we each had something different.  Every dish was fresh and flavorful.  The juice drinks (I wish I could remember the names) were very good.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really don't know where I should start with the food or being over charged... Well I'll tell u the mixed pupusa Was only masa and the horchata was so watered down I can't believe it why???? Why would u do that to your own business? As for as over charging people u have to live with that. It might be your last dollar so spend it wisely!!!! When u do lose your business and u will guaranteed. Reread this to your self and don't ask why!!!!"}
{"text":"Just a quick trip from Arcadia or Biltimore area  and you are eating Salvadorian cuisine. Reasonably priced, and large portions, with extras like a little bowl of chicken noodle soup to start you off.   Had a chance to speak with the owner and he gave us some background on the place and his daughters name is Eliana. It saddens me to go into a place like this at 7pm and not see it packed, when any given Fox Restaurant has a wait out the door. (Really PHX?)   Either way, go support this restaurant and your stomach. You will enjoy the food and atmosphere. Also the owner has come to our table everytime we have eaten there and said hi while  personally asking if everything is OK.  There is a dish with chicken and sour cream that has the word Favorito in the name, that is my fiancee's favorite.   Oh yah. And get down with some Papusas. You want be sorry."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. He's partial to latin american food since that's what his mom and grandma would make during his childhood.  We got there about 45 minutes before they were to close and we were greeted by whom, I can only assume were the owners. It was clean and reminded me a lot of the atmosphere from when I was vacationing in Belize.   I ordered the iced tea, which was extremely refreshing, and my boyfriend had the horchata. Their horchata wasn't bad, just less sweet than we've ever had before.   As for the food, we order 1 bean and cheese pupusa and one meat and cheese. I think the meat and cheese had more flavor, but the bean and cheese was still pretty good.  For our main meal, I got the bistec encebollado and my boyfriend ordered the carne asada. The bistec was delicious! It came with rice and beans and was smothered with the onion gravy. It also came with a small bowl of some other gravy-type food. It was a little gritty for my liking so I didn't  use it with anything.   I can't say what the carne asada tasted like as my boyfriend ate it all up before I had a chance to try it. But, it looked pretty amazing.   We'll definitely be coming back. And next time we'll bring friends and family so they can try it out too! Great place."}
{"text":"A favorite for excellent El Salvadoran food. Can't get enough of the pupusas, platanos fritos and horchata."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous.  We get the pupusa with just beans and cheese - so simple but so delicious.  The platano and yucca are also excellent.  The beans, alone, are worth the visit.  There are also yummy drinks.  We are a vegetarian family but we've brought meat eating friends and family there too - there is something for everybody and everyone has been pleased.  The service is so friendly and welcoming.  Go there!"}
{"text":"Such a tasty surprise hiding away in Phoenix. A lot of the people that have written reviews for this place didn't  know Salvadorian food, they should have asked exactly what they were ordering and perhaps how to eat it (what to dip it in, and such). Also perhaps they should have asked for recommendations if they didn't know the flavor palette they were in for I myself had the plantains (yes with tasty sour cream and beans mmm mmm yummy), Papusa's, a lovely bowl of soup (same soup the give you a little taste of with every meal but I had a large one) and some Orchata. Everything was excellent. Very good service as well. Comfort food at its  best and the prices are really reasonable!"}
{"text":"Service has drastically  fallen the good server they had left. They are down to the owners wife as the server.   I had been coming to this place since i moved  to az . About 10 years back in time now , I had  notice  loss of customer  service quality  previously. This last visit was the last time for me.!  I order my food and am waiting for the order to be ready. I  notice other patrons finish leave the establishment then return . When they return they placed an order to go.  They ordered after me about 15 min.  There to go order was ready before my dine in order. I  figured they might have ordered something  different so it was done faster.   That's when i herd the lady read back her order and it was similar  to my order. I  figured i could find a place with better customer  service.  (Guanagitos) located 10 blocks down the road.  Excellent  service the previous  server elianas had and food was tasty  and timely  manner served."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a weekday lunch, and Eliana's was busy.  The server said, \"I haven't seen you in a long time.  Do you want to see the menu, or do You already know what you want?\"  I ordered my usual: dos pupusas con carne.  And flan, for dessert.  I am a sucker for a place that recognizes me.  I don't love everything on Eliana's menu, but I love these things.  The pupusas arrived at my table piping hot.  I use all of the cabbage salad on top of them, and about half of the sauce.  Yummy goodness!  I've tried a few other things on their menu:  fried yucca (interesting) beans and cream for dessert (not so much).  I'll stick with what I know and love.  Plus, Eliana's is right down the street from my office, and the prices can't be beat.  One caveat:  I ordered my lunch to go once, and the packaging left a lot to be desired.  The sauce came in a baggie."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is always excellent-- it's usually the owner that waits on you. The food is wonderfully flavorful without using a lot of spice. Natural flavors are what makes this place tick.  I've eaten here many times, and my recommendation is that you just order every appetizer on the menu and forget the entrees. At least, the first time you go anyway... You'll want to try it all.  Very good food!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  I'm sitting here after I've eaten pupasas and some of the best carne asade I have had.  There is nothing like being full and satisifed after eating at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The service was great, the restaurant was spotless, the food was really great and it was very affordable.  The Pupusa's were amazing!  I also loved their mango iced tea and the desserts were really tasty as well."}
{"text":"I really like this place. We used to come here often and then didn't for a long time just because we weren't in the hood when they were open. The las two weeks I've been by and had a late lunch. The people that t=run this place are so genuinely nice. The ensalada drink is refreshing in this heat. I usually get a veg papusa and fried plantain. My husband had the chicken soup and loved it and then the chicken special and loved it. I'm so glad we went back."}
{"text":"Back home, I had my choice of great Salvadoran food in walking distance from my place amongst the multitude of pupuserias that dotted SF's Mission District.   \"Wait. Hold on there, buddy. What the hell's a pupuseria?\" you say.   Well, amigo, a pupuseria serves pupusas, which are small, handmade corn tortillas stuffed with, well, stuff (cheese, beans, and/or meat). Of course there are other Salvadoran specialties as well, but pupusas are what make Salvadoran food distinct from the cuisine of other nearby Central American countries and Mexico.  Moving to Phoenix, I spotted Eliana's pretty much within my first week here and thought to myself, \"Man, I have to check this place out.\" Of course, I only did so 18 months later, venturing into the decent-sized eaterie on McDowell & 24th Street to satisify my cravings, bringing along a bunch of friends who've never had Salvadoran food before.  The inside of Eliana's is pretty casual, with the Salvadoran flag and other arty decorations hanging from the walls. There are probably 8 booths and then a bunch of tables spread out in the dining room. Our server, who may have been one of the owners, was nice and patiently explained anything on the menu we had questions on, including giving recommendations to the vegetarians in the group. For appetizers we got 2 combination platters, each consisting of a pupusa, a tamal (tamale), and a pastele (stuffed pastry shell). The pupusas can come in either veggie or non-veg varieties. We also got fried plantain which came with refried beans and sour cream. They were all pretty decent (I'm a big platano fan so the plantain was definitely my favorite) , as was the complimentary mini-bowl of chicken soup and the glass of ice-cold Tamarindo that I got to drink. The pupusas weren't as great as some of the ones I've had in San Francisco, but they still held their own and my friends enjoyed them and eveything else on the platter.  For entree, I got the carne asada (pounded skirt steak with rice, grilled onions, salsa and beans) while other choices at my table included the arroz valenciana (a rice dish with shrimp and vegetables) and the vegetarian chile relleno. My steak, I would say, was alright - a bit gristly, but all in all a good value for the price. For dessert we got the banana burrito, which is basically what it sounds like. Fried banana wrapped in a sugar and cinammon-coated tortilla and served with vanilla ice cream. And that was excellent. No, let me correct myself. EXCELLENT. And dare I say, pretty frickin' ingenious. A burrito for dessert, because why not? And all this food ended up being around $18/person which seems like a pretty good deal to me.      I'd say overall, I'd give Eliana's a 3.75 and so I'll round it up to 4. It isn't the most amazing Salvadoran food I've had, but it's still pretty good and I'd recommend it to folks who're looking to try something a little different when it comes to Latin American grub."}
{"text":"I eat at this restaurant about once per month, so I figure I should give them credit. If the food was horrible, I would have written a review a long time ago. (That makes me kind of a jerk, huh?)  So fair is fair. If your restaurant is terrible, I will report it.  This place is excellent. Ironically, today, the day I write this review, I went here \"just for the ride.\" I was not feeling well and really didn't think I would be able to eat. So I just went to have iced tea.  The lady who waited on us (the owner?) heard me mumble to my companion that I wasn't feeling well. I'll just have iced tea, I told her.  In a motherly way, she said, \"why don't you try some soup to make you feel better?\"  So I agreed. Who can turn down soup?  It was delicious and I felt better after I ate it.  But since I've been here many times, the must-haves: plantanos fritos, yucca, papusas and the best iced tea in the world."}
{"text":"One of my worst experience ever my eating pupusas.  With that said the owner took our order and she was rude not friendly at all..... 1. She get the order wrong 2. She food was kind of cold 3. Seen like she didn't want to be there (she is the owner) found out she was the when I was paying the bill 4. She was trying to over charge the bill postings images of bill.   5. She never told us about the drinks weren't free refills  6. Got mad when I pointed out that the bill was added wrong  7. Slam the bill on the table when she corrected it. Even my girlfriend who is calm was shocked 8. When the bill the guy owner said sorry for the bad service When noticed I not happy"}
{"text":"Excellent place I've been a customer for years I believe they closed for good Sad,  I liked it"}
{"text":"This place is really good!  If you go, order the combination platter, it's the best way to try several el salvadorian specialities.  Also, don't forget to order the baked bananas - delicious!  The horchata should not be missed either, it is different than mexican horchata, it has cinnamon and other goodies.  Try it.  Very reasonably priced, you will leave very full and very satisfied."}
{"text":"Delicious! Very reasonable prices. Only wish i had room for dessert.....Cash only on Saturdays and Sundays"}
{"text":"Tried a little bit of a lot of things. It was all so good. The carne asada was awesome and the favorito de elianas was sooo good!! Restaurant was super clean and the owners were very friendly. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"For Phoenix anyway, maybe not when compared to those from El Salvador, but they are rock solid.  So are the fried plantains, yucca frita, and the curtido is always tasty, pretty much everything we have ever had.  And the horchata de morro is really good.  They also have some of the best beans anywhere in town."}
{"text":"We went to eat at Eliana's last Saturday, November 5, 2016 and it is gone!  We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Having passed this place more than once while driving around, I'd always wanted to stop by but never made it much of a priority. Well I stumbled across reviews here and due to the raving about the papusas I HAD to stop in.  My partner in crime was kind enough to accompany me and as soon as we did we too joined the pupusa bandwagon, mmm pupusa bandwagon (drools). We had the appetiser sampler which is good to share but might leave you wanting the another pupusa. I'm a fan of the chicken soup you get, but just wish the serving size was slightly bigger.  The appetizer comes with 3 different items and all are equally tastey (ref. pupusa). They also give you some cabbage salad and a tomato sauce to accompany the items, yum.  My gf ordered the recommended chicken dish and lurved the hell out of it, I agreed and actually was wishing I'd gotten that instead of the Salvadorian marinated steak, which was good, but paled in comparison to the chicken.  Sidenotes: Try the ensalada drink, it's a sweet fruit based drink that comes with slices of apple. Sort of reminds me of drinking a melted otter pop, which as far as I'm concerned is off the proverbial chain. Also served with appetiser and as a sidedish with the food was a bean soup which was good and great for dipping the tortillas in. Oh, and the tortillas are Salvadorian style meaning thick and sort of along the lines of a Mexican gordita, I could eat these for days.  Pupusas (drools) \"give me a towel boy\" (drools)"}
{"text":"I love, love, love Eliana's. I have been eating here for years and enjoy bringing people new to Salvadoran food. The interior is cheerfully decorated with colorful folk art, and the service is always swift and friendly.   My favorite items on the menu are: 1) the pupusas, kind of a soft gordita-like exterior with a meat and veggie thick stew-like interior - outrageously good!; 2) the yucca frita, fried yucca plant (very starchy, like potatoes) with some deep fried chunks of pork and garnished with radishes and cucumbers; 3) the ensalada drink, a bright-yellow fruit beverage with finely chopped assorted fresh fruit- comes with a straw and a spoon; 4) the plantain with beans and sour cream, a dish I wasn't sure about at first because I am very picky about my banana-type foods, but it totally and unexpectedly works and is ridiculously delicious.  Eliana's is so inexpensive and such a wonderful experience. Everyone can find something they'll like- low spiciness, but full of great flavors and textures."}
{"text":"Another surprise Phoenix location.  I broke out of the norm once again and went to Eliana's for a lunch.  The food here is amazing.   I was completely delighted by a new cuisine that I had never tried before.  The deep fried banana and ice cream that our server convinced us to get was well worth it, even though I had no room left in my stomach.  If you haven't been able to tell from my previous posts, I am completely into the ambiance of a restaurant.  This one was of the things that was lacking in this restaurant, but it also made it charming and homey.  The best part of the entire experience was our server.  You could tell that he was part of the family that owned the restaurant and truly cared for his location.  We quickly deemed him even more interesting than the Dos Equis man and decided that we needed to have some cocktails, and hear  some stories with this man.  There was something buttery in the way that he talked, a glimmer of hope in his voice, and a sense of passion about his business that really made you enjoy your experience.  I will be back.  Don't you worry.  I will be back.  This time with more friends."}
{"text":"DELISH.........I look forward to my return.  Wow, the food here was better than I expected. I ordered the rice with shrimp and chicken. It was fantastic. It came with a puréed bean sauce and cheese to put on top. It was made fresh as it was ordered.  All the items we ordered were above and beyond! It was clean inside and very quaint. It looks as though it is a husband and wife owned/run place. Very accommodating and pleasant.  The food was so tasty and non greasy. El Salvador style food is new to me and I like it! I am not a fan of traditional Mexican food....this is a great alternative for Latin flavors. I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Good flavor on the food and good variety of different drinks to try. No refills :(   small portions on popusas  average tab for 1 person $10-16"}
{"text":"I went here one time to try the pupusas; they were delicious and filling. I had intended to have them as a snack, but they were so hearty that the three I ordered became a very filling meal.  I returned with a friend and ordered a tamal as an appetizer; it was light and tender (unlike the denser Mexican tamales) and very flavorful. My entree was arroz valenciana, which was very colorfully presented and was a gustatory delight. My friend had the shrimp fajitas; I had a taste of that too and it was good, but I'm glad I ordered the arroz because I wanted something different from what I'd get in most Mexican restaurants. The Salvadoran tortillas are thick and substantial, unlike the thin tortillas served in Mexican restaurants.  Both our entrees came with a side of bean sauce -- yes, the bean preparation comes out as a thick and very tasty liquid, rather than the mash (\"refried beans\") in Mexican restaurants.  We were really quite full after finishing our entrees but couldn't resist ordering the fried banana burrito (especially after having read about that in a yelp review). I'm so glad we ordered only one because it was huge, and came with 2 scoops of ice cream. We split the dessert and although we were very full from the main dinner, we finished everything - it was so good, with just the right coating of cinnamon sugar.  As we waddled back to the car, I decided that I'm definitely coming back, again and again ... and thank goodness I have a huge appetite."}
{"text":"So yummy! Great Salvadoranian food. We ordered pupusas, plantains, chile relleno, favorito, carne asada and bisteca and loved all of it. The owner was our waiter and he was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back. Oh and the ends lads drink was real yummy. My daughter ordered the horchata and we liked it better than Mexican horchata"}
{"text":"I just had lunch at Eliana's today and thanks to other Yelpers, steered my way to the combo appetizer platter [and ordered an extra papusa so my friend Jim and I could both have one] as well as the chicken and shrimp entree. Before I go any further, of note here is that this is peasant food, served in simple surroundings. Having said that, its simply delicious. Our food was served all at once and was accompanied by tortillas and refried beans. These are NOT your mother's refried beans. They have an unbelievably smooth texture and are full of amazing flavor. We dipped our tortilla's [which in this case are 1/2 inch thick masa harina-esque mixed with shortening - am guessing] in the beans and just revelled in the great mix of flavor and texture. Between that and our other fave, the papusa's, we could have died happy at that moment. The papusa's are everything everyone says they are: warm, delicious, with meat, potato and cheese. Must be El Salvadoran for 'comfort food'. Its simple, flavorful and delightful. Although I was less of a fan of the shrimp/chicken/rice entree, it was still very fine.   The servers were extremely kind and friendly and when we asked about the refried bean prep, we were basically given the 411 on how they prep the beans, what they cook them with and how they get the texture [blender]. It was a delicious and satisfying lunch. Plenty of food for $21 plus tip."}
{"text":"Went with the family and it was a good time with good food.  I enjoyed trying something new to me.  The tamarindo drink was AMAZING.  We tried the yucca appetizer, the green corn tamale appetizer, the fried plantain with bean and sour cream appetizer.  Really enjoyed all of them.  Can't say I could pick a favorite.  My husband had the chicken and sour cream and my son had the carne asada.  They enjoyed their dinner but I thought the appetizers I ate looked better."}
{"text":"Really nice place to catch a reasonably priced dinner! From the outside it doesnt look all that special but dont let that fool you. Inside is clean and nicely decorated. Service is friendly and prompt. I had a grilled chicken breast served with peppers and onions with a sour cream sauce along with beans and rice...thumbs up to the dish! Wouldn't hesitate to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to lunch today, but it was closed !! Website said open, but shuttered."}
{"text":"Food was fine, even very good. Service was also fine. My low rating comes from what happened when I tried to use my Entertainment coupon. They refused it. The part that irritates me is that we had it out on the table visible but, they didn't mention it until after the order was in the kitchen. They pointed out that there is an obscure, poorly worded sign mixed in with a multitude of others on the door mentioning \"no promocians\". Won't be going back at any price. Too bad, I tend to frequent many that I've found through the E-Book."}
{"text":"Delicious. Had papusas and some other things selected at random off of the menu. All delicious. Also shared their fried plantain with beans and sour cream. Heaven.  This place is wonderful and delicious. And totally reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Nomnomnomnompupusanomnomnomnom  That's pretty much all you need to know.  Pupusas. I have dreamt of them every day since I had them. They are  warm & yummy & tasty & um.. good!  I think of them as a Latin American Hot Pocket, but you probably shouldn't.  Technically, they're listed as an appetizer, but next time I'm going I'm getting a few of them and making it a meal.  They also had super good soup - I just wish they gave me more than a lil espresso cup full! The fried plaintain was good, though not quite like I've tasted before - my coworker had never tried one though and really liked it. I also had a generous main dish with some peppers, onion, shrimp, & \"meat\".  With my dish, you could order it with shrimp and \"chicken\" or \"meat\".  I'm not sure I'm going to think about that too much more.  The shrimp & veggies were great, the meat was a little fatty for my taste ( kind of wish I'd gotten the chicken instead, my friend's looked great), & the beans were more of a strange liquid bean slurry side? Not sure how else to explain that.  But seriously, all the main stuff we ate was amazing, and a fellow even came over to explain to us how to eat the pupusas - put the cabbage salad on top, drizzle the sauce, enjoy! Seriously. You will enjoy.  EDIT:  Since writing this review we've gone back, and I had an appetizer combo with a pupusa, tamale, and meat pie thingy - all of which were well made and tasty! What I want to mention most though is the chili relleno my friend got - no cheese in it, but more like stew! One of the best I've ever tried! And I got the Tamarindo drink - I wish I had gallons of this stuff! It's a citrus tamarind drink that we agreed tasted a lot like mango lemonade. YUM. & my nice nice friend got me a piece of their queso dessert - apparently quesadilla (uh, I have to double check on the name) here is more like a light cake & a cheesecake had a baby... a delicious, cheese-danishy kinda tasting baby.  Try a piece with a friend!"}
{"text":"We love this Savadorean restaurant.  You got to try the Pupusas!  nice and friendly place."}
{"text":"Holy wow!  The food here is AWESOME.   Seriously, if any Yelper wants to come here to try it for the first time and they have no one to try it with, please send me a message ahead of time just so I can join you and have an excuse to eat there multiple times. Yeah, I'm serious.   I've never been to El Salvador and have never eaten Salvadoran food. I had no idea what \"pasteles\" were, but they remind me of India's samosas and I would've stuffed myself silly with them if I had an endless supply. I was actually secretly mad that my friends looked at what I ordered and took away huge chunks of it to \"sample\". Doesn't \"sample\" imply \"tiny little bite\"? Since when did its definition change to \"help yourself to a huge chunk that's up to one-third of the whole piece\"... times two for both the friends I was with? Jerks.   I don't even remember the name of my main entree. It had chicken and onions sauteed in a delicious sauce, some really unique-looking and tasty bean dip thing, and rice. A tiny cup of soup preceded each of our meals. All of this was accompanied by a thick, Salvadoran-style tortilla thing that I also forget the name of.   Nothing fancy here in terms of atmosphere/vibe. The decor is interesting enough, but it's basically like a no-frills typical Phoenix Mexican dive except nothing is even remotely Mexican. No liquor either, which kind of irked my friends at first when I dragged them here and forced them to try it.   They thanked me later."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I met a colleague here for lunch at his suggestion. I ordered a water - no ice, and I was surprised when the glass of water they brought me was warm. I don't mind drinking tap water, but I'm surprised they don't keep a pitcher in the fridge to keep it cold. The server never came around to refill my glass.   For my meal, I ordered the rice with shrimp and chicken without the chicken (I'm a pescatarian). The rice and beans were flavorful. The tortillas that came with it were bland and the cucumbers that came on the plate were bitter. My companion warned me that this was a place where once you get your food, the server doesn't come around again except to give you the check.  The ambiance felt cheap - cheap outdated decor that didn't feel welcoming. This is a place you definitely come to because you like the food.  It's a restaurant I wouldn't voluntarily select, but I'd go if a friend really want to go."}
{"text":"Since my dad is from Panama, he took me to this little restaurant just off of 24th st and McDowell. Since my parents instantly bond with anyone from Central, South America or that speaks Spanish, our service was very good. Although, the owner is very nice and would be cordial to anyone I am sure. My dad used to be a chef in his country but he doesn't cook anymore. When he does it is to die for, but you know men I guess, do something once and you love them for it only for them to never do it again. So it was with that retrospect that he ordered for the both of us.   The cuisines are somewhat similar to what we are used to and it is the use of yuca (aka cassava, manioc root) that stands out the most to me. (Yucca is an ornamental plant that does not have the root of the yuca and is commonly confused with Yuca.) On the menu for appetizers is Yuca frita o sancochada-which is basically the root fried or boiled. There is also the delicious papusas (thick, hand-made tortilla made from masa de maíz that is stuffed with cheese, pork, beans, and green bell peppers or you can get it vegetarian style without pork) that she brought to the table with the traditional curtido- pickled cabbage relish that you eat the papusas with. Then there is the tomato salsa that you can top that off with.  Altogether you could probably make a meal out of these papusas which are a pretty good post bar food if you ask me, but then you would be cheating yourself out of more food! Their fried plantains (starchy fruit) come with sour cream and beans but I like them the way I grew up with; eating them with just sugar sprinkled on both sides.   Some other meals for you meat eaters include:   Filete de Pescado a la Plancha (fish fillet on the grill) that comes with rice, salad and tortillas. Chicken breast on the grill, fajitas, chile relleno and of course quesadillas for dessert. Salvadorian quesadillas are not the same as Mexican quesadillas, it is a cheese pound cake. They also have plantanos fritos con crema y frijoles o con sorbet (fried plantain, beans and whipped cream or with ice cream), flan, or a banana burrito with ice cream.    Their fresh fruit drinks were really tasty as was the Tamarindo. Altogether a small menu but I felt like I was at home, so I will return and bring my gringo boyfriend with me."}
{"text":"OMGS you guys. This is a little diamond in the rough. Nice and cheap, with a modest, but DELICIOUS, menu. I share the combo platter with my BF and then usually get the chicken, which is so moist and tender and slathered in creme...  And it comes with a little cup 'o chicken soup which is yum-sauce.  Papusas.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I'm from the SF Bay area and I get pupusa from Zocalos and La Bamba. While the pupusas here were pretty good I can't say the same for some of the plates. I ordered the bistec something and it was drenched in some sort of gravy. While the meat was tender, it was abit salty for my taste. The cabbage salad they gave was great but the accompanying salsa was very bland.   While I might come back here just for some pupusas.   The drink we had was pretty good. And yes it was a fluorescent yellow."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Great customer service and authentic Salvadorian food.  We had meat pie, pupusas, chicken soup, chicken tamale rice and beans.  Pineapple fruit drink was delicious.  We were on our way to the celebrity theatre and stopped to have a bite to eat.  It was only 5 minutes away.   Place is very clean the spicey cabbage went really well with the pupusas (this was my favorite).  The soup had lots of goodies to add to the soup.  Their vegetables were really al dente yummy.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Very Cute and Cozy Place!   The Food was AMAZING!  Seriously I have been thinking about it all day and whether my diet likes it or not I'll be returning very soon!   I got the Appetizer Platter which came with a Pupusa, a chicken meat pie, a chicken tamale and beans. (see pics)   Everything was wonderful and fresh and oh so Delicious!   I would have to tell anyone who has never had this kind of food, do not be intimidated, go for it you won't be sorry, my particular meal wasn't spicy or greasy it was just the best thing I have tasted in weeks and it's definitely budget friendly!"}
{"text":"let me preface by first saying that i have never had salvadorian food before so therefore i do not know what good salvadorian food tastes like, or is supposed to taste like, so this review is strictly from my american palette and what i think tastes \"good\".  we arrived around 6pm on this wednesday evening and there was only one other couple in the entire place. dead. crickets chirping. it's rather odd inside. somewhat tacky and cheap, but i wasn't expecting a fine dining meal.   we went with the iced tea (spicy!) and the ensalada drink (refreshing!). got the appetizer platter with the meat pie, pupusa, rice, beans, and tamale. the tamale was rather soggy, and the chunks of chicken inside were large chunks and just kind of awkward. the meat pie was cheesey and delicious as was the pupusa. and the rice..well, i could eat that rice every single day! buttery and fluffy is how i'd describe it. for entrees i chose the camaron and carne fajitas and my girlfriend chose the chicken with rice and salad. hers was delicious, mine was meh. it came loaded with onions and the tails were still on the shrimp. the tortillas were different, to say the least, really thick and doughy, i didn't care for them too much.  overall, the food is very bland. i don't know if that's a characteristic of salvadoran food, but i like my food with a bit of a kick or spice to it."}
{"text":"I think they display too much religious idolatry at this restaurant and they also had some religious trinkets for sale at the cash register. This place felt like a dusty old shrine as much as a restaurant which made me feel a little uncomfortable. Good thing I just popped in here for a to go order. I could have gotten better food down the street out of the Vaquero's drive thru window. Even their famous pupusa was just OK, so not sure why this place seems to be so popular around the local area???"}
{"text":"Whoever the old guy in reading glasses needs to learn some tact....i tried going in on a Saturday at 5:50 but there was a private party...all he said was \"we're closed\" no explaining as to why and didn't offer alternative times to come back....well since he obviously doesn't give a fk if customers come back or not, i guess ill grant him his wish and not come back"}
{"text":"Most amazing Salvadorian cuisine in Arizona.  Love this place so much been coming here for years.  Most definitely recommend going here for anyone who wants to taste the most delicious pupusas in the North American border."}
{"text":"I used to go there for lunch before I retired. I brought my wife there a couple of times, and she loves it, but it's such a long way from our home.  This restaurant is always clean. There was an employee mopping the floor after the lunch crowd.    My favorite is the Arroz A La Valenciana. All the vegetables are fresh and the pupusas are excellent."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is the same as I have experienced in Central America --light, not so spicy, and varied in texture. We had a very helpful man suggest items from the menu. I strongly recommend the fruit drink with chunks of fruit (in the picture). And they have pupusas that are really good with fresh coleslaw. Try this as an appetizer. The tortillas are not what you might be used to --they are about 5\" in diameter and thick like a pancake. But they are made fresh and are really nice. My companion had the aroz valenciana which was tasty and I had the Elianas favorite which was grilled chicken with that terrific latin american creme cheese. Mmmmmm... cheese! The service was consistent and friendly and the food was tasty and a nice break from all the Mexican joints in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant three times for lunch while at work, and I must say that the first time I was there, the service was slow and the food mediocre.  The last two times I went there, it was not by my choice but by group consensus.  The food is also mediocre at best, having a friend whose mother is from El Salvador, this food was terrible, absolutely terrible in comparison.  The beans and cheese and pork inside my pupusa had the consistency of water, and the hot sauce seemed like it was 3 parts water, 1 part hot sauce.  Each time I went there I called ahead and placed my order, and I had to wait at least 15 minutes for my drink and at a minimum of 30 - 45 min. to wait for my food (after ordering ahead!!).  I brought this up with the family that owns the restaurant, and they told me, in their exact words, it's not their problem, and if I had brought more people then we would have had better service and they don't need to worry about one customer because they have been there for so long if they lose one customer, they have many more waiting.  I don't understand how a place with one or two waitresses can even expect to adequately service their customers correctly.  I have been overcharged and never received items that I have ordered that were still on my check and I had to argue with the owner.  It is by far the worst service I have ever received in this city.  About 5 people I work with have all sworn to never return to this store."}
{"text":"OK, I'll start with a disclaimer, I absolutely adore the people that run this restaurant and have been going to their restaurant since I moved to Phoenix around '91 (two locations ago). However, I have taken countless people to try the food from my native country and EVERYONE has LOVED it.   From my vegetarian to foodie (or chowhound) friends have found something (usually more) that keeps them coming back. Many thank me for having introduce them to this jewel of a restaurant.  My favorite is the Mojarra Frita becaus it brings back memories of growing up in beautiful El Salvador.  I recommend the Especial Combinacion de Eliana's for first time visitors -- it has a Salvadorean tamale wrapped in banana leaf and is moist like a mousse; the tradtional pupusa and a savory turnover called Pasteles ($6).  For a hearty meal, the I recommend the Bistec (beef)  or Pollo (chicken) dishes that come with salad, rice, beans and Salvadorean tortillas ($8.95).. After reading some of the reviews, I just liked to say, thank you for trying out this food but it is not Mexican food.  I can recommend some of those if you msg me"}
{"text":"The pupusas are absolutely delicious! I'm a huge fan of the Bean and Cheese! Also, their rice was spectacular! It's been a long time since I've had a restaurant do rice right! I had the Orchata (which was very different than the Horchata that I'm accustomed to, but still delicious). I have a feeling I'll be trying the Ensalada drink next time.   As for the place, itself, I walked in and was immediately greeted by a person I can only assume was the owner. She was friendly but professional. Once she took my order, she got straight to cooking.   Overall, I was very impressed. This place is definitely going to become one of my regulars!"}
{"text":"So on the advice of Michelle's review, my friend Brian (my lunchtime buddy) and I ventured over here for lunch the other day.  I won't go into too much detail, but I will say that it was good.  Not amazing, but good.  However, I have never had El Salvadorian food before, so maybe I needed to be broken in.  I started with the mango iced tea which tasted a little like dirt, not horrible, but had a dirt flavor to it if that makes any sense.  I saw the guys next to me get these bright neon yellow drinks with chunks floating in them and decided I must try it.  It turned out it was the ensalada drink, which I thought meant \"salad\" but maybe that's my American translation.  Apparently it means \"delicious fruit salad\" drink.  I ate the chunks out of it, trying to figure out what each one was.  I was thinking it was something exotic, so I made Bri try it, turns out it was apple.  Oops.  So it has apple, pineapple and carrot chunks, maybe not exotic, but still delicious.  The little shooter of soup is good.  Its like a chicken noodle without the noodle with potatoes thrown in for good measure.  I got the appetizer combo that Michelle got, it was plenty of food for a meal.  I don't know what was what, but I like the flat tortilla looking thing with the cheese the best...it was either a pupusa or a posteles, but it was good!  The tamale was different than the typical, it was not wrapped in a corn husk but what looked like a palm frond, but I could be wrong.  Heck, I couldn't even identify an apple that day!  It also had shredded chicken, potatoes and carrots in it.  Very tasty.  They also serve this soupy tomatoey salsa that is very mild.  That, combined with the slaw they serve as a garnish really adds some taste to most of the items.  They also give you 1 \"tortilla\" per person.  Its their version of a tortilla, but much different than the Mexican version.  This is much smaller, and thicker, almost like a pita, gordita or fry bread.  My friend got some sort of chicken dish with a large amount of what looked like sour cream underneath it.  Unfortunately for him, he hates sour cream, but some rearranging of the plate and some dousing in tomatoey salsa and he was good to go.  I tried to order the \"quesadilla\" dessert thing that Michelle  mentioned because I truly wanted to know what the bastard child of cheesecake and cake would taste like, plus the name was intriguing...but they were out.  They were also out of their carne asada, which looked good.  Other people had some.   It was busy when we were there, but the service was good and everyone was really friendly.  There was even a very large table of about 15 people in there celebrating a birthday and everyone (OK, well me and my friend and the servers) sang to them.    I think I want to go back now and try the chile relleno and some more of the \"tortilla\" wrapped cheesy meaty deliciousness.  UPDATE -  I wonder if that's a record for an update (10 minutes)! I just noticed in the beginning I said I won't go into too much detail, then proceeded to go into perfect detail.  I guess its impossible for me not to be long-winded.  Oh well...you finished reading, now do you feel like you wasted 5 minutes of your life? :)"}
{"text":"The best ever!!! You must try the pupusas!! The plantains with cream and beans are to die for! Also, try the endalada drink!! Very yummy!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the bistec. It was a nice cut with the right flavors and fresh veggies. Tortillas are just lightly fried and not too filling on starch. Had a nice plantano dessert with it. Very clean and the service is pleasant."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by after a recommendation from a family member, and I was not disappointed. I had a pupusa filled with meat and cheese, and arroz a la Valeniana, which is a rice dish with chicken and shrimp mixed in. Both were delicious. I will definitely be back to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"I LOVE ELIANA'S.  I grew up in Phoenix, and I have been going to Eliana's for as long as I can remember (all the way back to their old location.) The food is delicious, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the people are really nice.   I love the chicken breast with red sauce and cabbage on top, and the beans are fantastic. Of course the tortillas and pupsuas are amazing too! And Eliana's lemonade is delicious in a way that I can't quite put my finger on.  Eliana's is always one of my first stops when I'm back in Phoenix, and it definitely deserves five stars!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little place that was amazingly clean and friendly. We were greeted, sat ourselves, and then made the hard choice of what to order. The gentleman there was extremely attentive and friendly. We ordered one cheese Pupusa, one bean and cheese Pupusa, and something I cant remember the name of that was Plantain with Sour Cream and Beans. Food was delicious in it's own way. Not too impressed with the bean and cheese Pupusa but my sis just about died of the cheese Pupusa. The plantains were awesome, but the fried areas tasted a little too kin to onion rings for my taste. I love when you can taste the banana, with the cream and beans. Definitely will return to try the fajitas of shrimp with chicken."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here on one of his day's off. We ordered the appetizer combo plate to share, along with meals of chile relleno and carne asada.  Eliana's simple menu of homestyle Salvadoran food may have been novel and interesting to diners 25+ years ago when this place first opened, but it's just plain boring by today's standards.  Aside from their thick Salvadoran-style tortillas, which were quite good, there's really nothing being served here that you wouldn't find at a grocery store deli counter for better quality and half the price.  Nothing was particularly flavorful at this restaurant, and to top off our decidedly mediocre experience, we were overcharged by $2.  When my husband brought this to the attention of the owner, he laughed and gave my husband some stupid double-talk about how we supposedly ordered beans and rice, but the meals come with beans and rice anyway. . . Obviously, I don't see a return trip to this place.  Overall mediocre, uninteresting food at a poor value price."}
{"text":"I think I just don't like El Salvadoran food. It's either that or I accidentally consumed the cardboard and polymer display models in lieu of my actual entree. That was some seriously dry, bland food. Even tossing some watered down hot sauce on that pile of bland meat and carbs didn't really improve the edibility. I had the appetizer platter and the chicken with white rice and weird white sauce with a dry side salad. It was a bland, white platter of food. Plus, what's with the side salad of iceberg and radishes? Is it garnish? It's not dressed with anything and, you know, tastes just like a pile of lettuce.   Maybe I'm just an ignorant prick. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe I just don't like El Salvadoran (although I love just about everything else Central American).   The pupusas were crazy delicious though. I would totally return for these. (And only these.)"}
{"text":"Great taste. Inexpensive. Great Service. Not in the best area of town but don't let that throw you off. Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I love their food! But also very sad that elianas is no longer there and has been replaced with a Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The owners are super sweet and the food is super yummy! The pupusas, beans and their Chile relleno are my go to! And their horchata is authentic fresh horchata, it looks like dirty water lol but I promise you it tastes awesome! The beans texture throws you off because it's soupy but once again the flavor is insane! Also, their chicken soup hits the spot."}
{"text":"No .   Never again . Horrible !    First !   They tell you that they don't accept debit card and they point to circle k outside the window and tell you to go take out money there . Second !  All they play is really loud Spanish religious music .   Third !  The couple that run the place are of course salvadoreans in their early 60s .... Rude as hell .  The lady has no manners and talks to you like your stupid .   Last but not least ... the food.   The food was alright .  Nothing to brag about .  No thank you. Never again."}
{"text":"Literally just getting back from the East Coast and eating Julia's Empanadas (Washington, DC) and Ruben's Empanadas (NYC), I was fiending for some more when I landed in Phoenix. A quick Yelp search turned up Eliana's and since it was on my way home from the airport, I decided to stop in to get my fix. Initially, I only planned on getting the combo platter and ensalada drink. Then I started thinking back on my fond memories of pupaserias (sp?) in the Mission district of SF so I flagged down the waiter to have that added on to my order.   My ensalada drink arrived w/ a little cup of chicken & potato soup which instantly made my stomach do a little churn. I'm not sure if it was because the ensalada drink looked like a liquid highlighter or the fact that an ice cold beverage was served with a hot soup, but being the starving beast that I was, I took a sip of the glow-stick and devoured the tasty chicken soup. I couldn't really figure out if the drink tasted like anything other than sweet water w/ a few pieces of fruits & carrot, but it was interesting to order nonetheless.    Not sure what to say about the pupusa and combo platter other than, it was very MOIST. I'm sure you're thinking, \"WTH how could she describe a pupusa, empanada, pasteles and tamale as moist?,\" but trust me, it was a lot odder for me to taste these unexpectedly moist items. I'm not sure it was moist from the meat juices or grease but I ate a few bites of each item and left the rest. Feeling rather unfulfilled from everything, I decided to order the quesadilla dessert. As the other reviewers have already mentioned, it's not the quesadilla that most of us are accustomed to. I'd describe it as corn bread (minus the gritty corn texture) with a cream cheese flavor. Kinda strange.. not my thang.   So 3 stars to Eliana's for the MOIST items. I'd give it an extra .5 star for the soup, but unfortunately that's not an option and I didn't think it'd merit a whole extra star on its own."}
{"text":"Went in to this place not sure because I'm super picky, but it was great! The food was delicious and inexpensive. The owner was so warm and friendly. Had a great time and highly recommend it!"}
