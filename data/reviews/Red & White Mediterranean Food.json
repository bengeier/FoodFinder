{"text":"It's not called Red & White anymore, but it still is a middle-eastern place that serves falafels.  Avoid it at all costs.  The guy slapped together a falafel using a couple of overcooked, stalefalafel balls lying around, slapped on some greasy spread, and barely heated it up in its paper wrapping.  Charged more than any of the other good falafel joints within a three-block radius, and said a surly goodbye.  It was stone-cold and awful.  I only hope I don't get sick."}

{"text":"First-rate, super crispy, ultra-flavorful, perfectly-prepared, low cost shawarma.  The falafel's good too.  The best in TO (with honorable mention to King Shawarma off Chinatown) in my opinion.  Great service, friendly Arab-American expats (from Toledo, Ohio actually), and a clean dining area.  Still, this is street food at its best, and most get it to go.  I get a combination beef/chicken shawarma sandwich with tahini and hot sauce AND LOTS OF NAPKINS!  If you say combo, they'll think you mean the meal WITH fries and a drink, so be specific.  Either way, it's a great and affordable Middle Eastern treat.  In fact, most of the restaurants in this neighborhood (full of hemp shops and aggressive panhandlers) are ethnic/affordable, even without the presently favorable exchange rate (as of Jan/09).  Good thing, because the dollar's going to drop like a rock again once the multiple (and reckless) economic stimulus packages/bailouts kick in - All hail Barak Obama's America (I know; much of the dollar's freefall occurred under Bush).  #$%^ politics!  Let's eat some shawarma!  My only complaint about this place is that they don't always open on time."}
