{"text":"That Café has that small neighborhood coffee feeling to it, which makes it very cozy and warm. Had I been a writter, this is the type of place I'd always be in. The coffees are amazing and will satisfy the toughest critics. The food is excellent as well,  not pretentious or extravagant but delicate yet simple. I had 'La grande assiette' (3,5/5) and the 'Bol du brunch (4/5). Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I had the delight of taking my bestie here after a morning of climbing. We stumbled in, kind of by accident, as my usual Rue Centre dig was ferme, but it was a little bit of Sunday Serendipity because this place was just the cutest! The staff were all very friendly and welcoming and we felt like we were in a friend's kitchen. The food was so so good. I had the maison granola which was basically a granola like I've never had before! Firstly, it was gigantic. Secondly, it was layered with deliciousness, including apple compote and a berry compote that was a delightful mystery because I couldn't tell what berry it was crafted from! Annnnd it contained those lovely concord grapes, and so much more. Order this if you want something healthy, but filling and a flavour fest. My friend ordered the brunch tartine and was equally pleased ... I won't write more about her meal, because I spent all my time engaged with my own dish so can't really say much about what she had, except that she stated the eggs on the tartine were the best she's ever had. I will be back for sure :D"}
{"text":"They don't accept credit cards (Amex, MasterCard, Visa) even though the food lacks value (high prices, small servings. So it feels pike you've been ripped off when the times comes to pay. The sitting area area is dirty, especially the couch and the staff is not presentable. So you wonder why they charge so high and not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Découvert par hazard, ce petit café avec une atmosphère 'comme à la maison' à de quoi faire plaisir à vos papilles.  Les lattes et cappuccinos sont préparés avec expertise et sont très bons. J'ai goûté le bol du brunch qui m'a franchement épatée.  Un merveilleux mélange de kale, quinoa, patates douces assaisonnées et mesclun avec un oeuf dur.  Un plat complet plein de saveurs et de fraîcheur.   Si je craques bien souvent pour le bol du brunch,  les gaufres sont elles aussi un vrai délice. Une consistance et texture parfaite servies avec sirop et pommes."}
{"text":"I love the brunch at coffee bloom! i always feel full of energy but light after a meal here. My fav is the BOL DU BRUNCH. Pair it with a nice chai late and a chit chat with tge friendly staff and you set up for a beautiful day. I come here and read also and I just observed that they have lunch menus during the week..."}
{"text":"This cafe is such a cozy and lovely spot! They have free wifi and several outlets, so it's a good place to work or study, but it's also great for coffee dates and just catching up with friends! Their food is also great - they have delicious pastries, and I really enjoyed their savoury dishes. Their savoury dishes are tasty, but healthy and light as well, which I really appreciate. I've had the bloom bowl and the chicken sandwich, which were both really good, and I also had the soup which I really really enjoyed - it was a carrot and rosemary soup (the carrot was puréed) and it was so delicious. I think their soups vary daily, too! They also have several breakfast dishes, such as waffles, which my friend really enjoyed. They also offer brunch on weekends (so many options!!)  Overall, a great spot that is perfect for anything - getting your study groove on, eating breakfast/lunch/dessert, or grabbing coffee! Love this spot :)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in pointe at Charles. Cute and cosy decor.  Homemade healthy style cooking, try the ratatouille tartine plate: delicious and healthy choice. Great selection of organic teas.   That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"Une merveille de petite place dans le sud-ouest de Montréal.  Plusieurs tables, de délicieuses pâtisseries. Des lattés, des chaï, des cafés. Un personnel accueillant, chaleureux. De quoi passer à travers n'importe quelle journée grise !"}
{"text":"Cafe Bloom is my favorite lunch place to eat when I come to Montreal for work. everything is so tasty and fresh! Today they had a chicken sandwich with avocado on beet (!!) bread. The salad of the day was warm corn and onions and cabbage. I was so satisfied. BUT WAIT! They had a delicious deep chocolate brownie with fleur de sel. So good!"}
{"text":"Le croque épinard, l'assiette de brunch vege, une ambiance cozy, tranquille et des sourires...c'est juste ce qu'il faut pour se sentir bien, profiter de l'ambiance et \"chiller\" autour de bons petits plats que je trouve bien créatif et surtout vachement bons."}
{"text":"Best coffee spot in the Point! Excellent healthy salads and brunch. Try the salad bowl! Coffee is also excellent. Great spot for brunch on weekends and coffee/working lunch on weekdays.   Make sure to get there before 3pm as the kitchen closes."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is surprisingly great. Staff super nice and it's kid friendly without being loud/annoying. Bright and good music too!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Montreal and stopped in for a Sunday brunch. My sister and I each ordered the small breakfast each and shared a waffle. BEST waffle of my life. Cute place, affordable."}
{"text":"Trip 1 Adventure begins! Frog and Panda goes to Cafe Bloom, a small eclectic cafe hidden away near metro Charlevoix among a mostly residential area. The cafe is bright and clean; it is almost like your grandma's home. There is an assortment of chairs and tables like it is put together from different garage sales but together fits perfectly. We order an ice coffee and cafe moka and two large waffles with maple syrup and apple slices. The cafe moka is rich and creamy but a little on the sweet side. Ice coffee is ice coffee, no frills, done right. The waffles are warm, crunchy with a soft centre but where is the blueberry jam? Overall, a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The last time I went for lunch with a friend and I was extremely happy with my meal. I ordered a quinoa bowl with roasted vegetables with some kind of fresh salad on top of it. It was a smorgasbord of deliciously healthy ingredients and the flavours complimented each other well. Their spanakopitas are also wonderful. They make really good chai lattes and regular lattes too.   My main issue with this restaurant is the seating arrangement. If you're alone sitting at a two person table, they will actually ask you to get up and go sit at a big table with a whole bunch of other people. Sometimes you just want your own table and don't really feel like squishing in between a bunch of strangers. Also the chairs are extremely uncomfortable. They are the same model you probably sat on daily during the long hours of elementary school.   At the same time the lighting is soothing and the vibe is pretty chill. If you can grab one of the couches, it's totally worth going."}
{"text":"Cafe Bloom has the cute Montreal brunch vibe. White tables with A+ lighting, cute seating arrangements, and mason jars. Despite that, it failed to meet my expectations. We were three people checking out the restaurant for Sunday brunch. I decided to try out the Grande Assiette meal, which consists of two eggs, toast, a small salad, some tomato-y mix of beans, bacon, and sausage. Can't go wrong with that. The beans and eggs were good (I mean, you can't really mess those up). The sausage was... odd. It was weirdly flavourless, and I immediately regretted opting for a mix of bacon and sausage as opposed to just bacon. The bread came with blackberry jam, which was very average.   Also, major pet peeve of mine: the glasses we got were still dirty, with traces of orange pulp still lining the inside of the cup.   However, my friend got the breakfast bowl and it looked super promising.   Overall, a very average experience. I'm not sure if I would go back. But if I do, I would try the bowl next time."}
{"text":"Oh mon dieu.... Les avocado toasts sont délicieux !!!! C'est un vrai plaisir d'en trouver d'aussi bons! L'assiettes d'uf sur brouillés est aussi un régale. Très bon rapport qualité prix. Je recommande!"}
{"text":"Café Bloom! Yay! Happy place!   That is how I feel when I walk in the door. The light. The friendly service. The other clientele. What can I say? Positive vibes all around, it's just a great spot.  Their pastries are out of this world, but unfortunately, they are so out of this world that there often aren't any left after the breakfast rush. Le sigh... But if you get there in time, you'll find a pretty good assortment of croissants and muffins, as well as some nice little treats like canelés.  If I had one criticism it would be that they should really kind of have a proper pastry case, and keep it stocked a bit better. (There's something about pastries just sitting on plates atop a counter that makes everything seem...wilted...) But I mean, it's a small thing. Not going to keep me away from a good cookie.  Coffee is great. I'm a huge fan of any place that defaults to whole milk in their beverages. I mean...come on...if we're going to drink a creamy latte in a bowl, let's do it for real. (And if I may play the nerdy barista for a moment - more fattening milk is not better simply because milk fat is delicious, it also produces a far superior foam. Fats make the bubbles perfect.)  I love their brunch/lunch quinoa bowls, and they do waffles all day long, which is pretty sweet.   Take note - lunch is all week, brunch is only on the weekend.   They're kid friendly, they're big group friendly."}
{"text":"C'est un dimanche ensoleillé qui m'amène au Café Bloom. Je suis directement frappée par l'atmosphère du café! Il y a un vieux planché teinté en gris, un comptoir avec des carellages de style floral super beau (j'adoooooore), des tables et chaises dépareillées anciennes, des bureau d'écolier, un beau fauteuil bleu azur (vraiment top). C'est cozy, relax, j'y ai d'ailleurs passé toute l'après-midi! :D  On a vraiment l'impression d'être chez soi, c'est vraiment chaleureux! Parmis tous les cafés que j'ai visités à Montréal (environ une vingtaine jusqu'à présent), celui-ci arrive vraiment dans mon top 5! Chouette ambiance, bon café, bons petits plats! Une halte parfaite si vous voulez chiller et vous poser tranquillement!  J'ai mangé des gaufres belges! Etant belge, c'était une nécessité!  Miam miam! Elles sont bonnes, croustillantes et sucrées comme il le faut!  Quand j'y étais, un groupe de musiciens jouaient dans le café. C'était vraiment très chouette de pouvoir bénéficier de ce petit concert :D   Je dis oui oui oui! :D"}
{"text":"Nous avons vu Café Bloom pour la première fois lors d'une course dans le coin. C'est un petit café comme on pourrait trouver sur le plateau, mais en plein coeur de Pointe St-Charles.  À première vue, vous pourrez voir un assemblement de chaises et tables différentes avec un petit look vintage ou juste vieux. On peut dire que ça fait rétro. En plus, y'avait de l'art sur les murs. Une des différences des petits brunchs du genre sur le plateau : il y avait de la place! On était pas crampé dans une petite pièce, on a de la place.  Le choix du menu est assez simple, il y avait 8 choix différents environ, variant de 7 à 11$. C'est un menu de brunch assez normal je dirais avec des bons choix santé / végé.   J'ai pris le bol Bloom. C'est un bol rempli de bonnes choses comme : du quinoa, du kale, des courges, du chou et un oeuf et avec une petite sauce à mettre par dessus. Ça me fait vraiment penser aux bols qu'on peut trouver chez Aux Vivres.  C'était bien bon. Avec le quinoa qui enveloppe le tout, je peux dire que c'était assez (même si j'ai fini l'assiette de ma blonde).  Fauve a décidé de prendre l'assiette brunch. Vous pouvez y trouver ce que vous trouvez dans tous les brunchs : bacon, saucisse, oeufs, petite confiture fraise-rhubarbe maison, patates et bines.  C'est avec plaisir que j'y retournerai. Bon rapport qualité/prix."}
{"text":"Large,airy, well-lit café in what used to be a second hand/junk shop that was there for over 30 years. In back, separated by a heavy drapery, stands a makeshift kitchen.  The place is furnished with various vintage /collectible REAL wood castoffs, salvaged from second hand stores, and has a large bar with stools, should you prefer to sit there. The tea was ok, served in what looked like second hand cast offs, it was good to just sit and relax a bit on a wet chilly day. The ambiance is friendly and relaxed with no hurry,  the prices comparable to elsewhere. Nice addition to the neighbourhood, too bad it closes so early in the day."}
{"text":"Very cute breakfast/brunch/lunch place  I had the Croque Epinards, Almond Croissant and Pancakes. All amazing!"}
{"text":"TARTINE DU BRUNCH...  Samedi ou dimanche matin, et on veut un petit déjeuner qui ne taxera pas la journée en matières lourdes à digérer? La tartine du brunch est ma prescription...  L'assiette que je viens de déguster est de loin une des meilleures qu'on puisse espérer. L'assaisonnement des ufs brouillés est d'une subtilité qui se dévoile à chaque bouchée.  Un goût agréable, particulier à ce mélange judicieux de fines herbes, de champignons des bois et de copeaux fins de fromage. C'est ce qui coiffe une tranche de pain de type artisanal occupant une moitié de l'assiette.  Quant à l'autre moitié, c'est un mesclun de feuilles de salades et de choux rouge, arrosé discrètement d'une vinaigrette dont ont sent la présence, mais sans que la salade ne baigné dans une flaque huileuse, comme on le voit trop souvent.  Impossible de ne pas donner une note parfaite à ce plat."}
{"text":"This is a peaceful cozy cafe hidden in a quiet corner of the city. I haven't tried any of the pastries/the breakfast menu. But everyone at this place is very friendly, the interior decoration is simple and tasteful with bright floor-to-ceiling windows, the coffee is very good and they have almond milk. That's pretty much all I need!"}
{"text":"Bonne nourriture mais vraiment trop cher pour ce que j'ai mangé. Un supplément de 3$ pour 6 petits bouts de tofu mariné dans le bol Bloom c'est vraiment trop cher et scandaleux. Au final je m'en sors pour 23$ tout compris pour un bol et un muffin. N'importe quoi .... Je pense clairement pas revenir au vue des prix et des portions qui sortaient de la cuisine."}
{"text":"Great cozy spot for a cup of coffee in Pointe St-Charles with a good and varied brunch menu as well; from eggs to pancakes and breakfast bowls too, all locally sourced and fresh! Tried the tartine made of scrambled eggs with herbs on rye bread with oystermushrooms and parmesan, served with mesclun salad and coleslaw: delicious! Service was a bit slow for a busy day but would definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Loved to stumble upon this big bright comfy clean cafe today. A friend had messaged me about it saying it was one of her favourite new finds in her neighbourhood, but I hadn't really made a mental note of its location and then BAM, comfy couch beneath me, delicious coffee in hand, amazing smells in the air from the good food cooking, I had found it! And I'll be back for sure. It's spacious and smiley enough that I wouldn't feel bad making good use of the wifi there for a good long while. Plus I love that you can see the big open kitchen in the back, and I love the pretty wooden rocking horse and other kids toys. Generally a dear spot that I hope experiences all the best success."}
{"text":"Great little brunch place.. healthy and defiantly a family place. When I say family I also mean strollers and kids.. lots of them! That ok it's quite nice to see mothers and fathers going out for a nice breakfast with the kids. Not too sure about safety though.. the ramp inside is convenient for wheel chairs and strollers but dangerous when walking around. I stumbled a   Couple of times on the edges.  They should put a rail on the sides..  the coffee is quite good. I ordered the waffle plate. It's tender and drizzled a few fruited (I'd expect a little more).  The quinoa bowl was great and highly recommend. It comes with a soft boiled egg, sweet potato and this awesome hummus (a little more would have been nice) I would have dunked some fresh bread in that sauce.  The service was polite but slow.. very slow..  I'd defiantly go back and try the lunch menu.."}
{"text":"I found myself in Point St-Charles on my way to help out with Yelp's contribution to the Share the Warmth Foundation fundraiser and I was having a hard time finding a place where I could grab a coffee. Lucky me - I stumbled upon Le Café Bloom. Admittedly, all I had was a coffee and a muffin (a delicious muffin though!) but what a CUTE place. The decor was that amazing blend of rustic and hip and the vibe in there was totally zen.  There was a young family siting together having breakfast and the vibe of the whole place made me want to return. So I there is another reason to visit Point St-Charles I guess!"}
{"text":"Just a hint fruity but still very good coffee. I live how the have comfy couches where you can sit and relax. There are lots of people who come read and study here and it's fine."}
{"text":"It really is a highlight of my morning to walk by this place and just have some time to relax, have a good coffee and a REALLY good pastry here.  I think I might soon get addicted to their pistachio croissant.   Nice couch, good atmosphere, service with a smile... Wifi and cozy, what else ?"}
{"text":"Great place in PSC. The food is very good, decent size and well priced. Good place to go with kids. Only downside, only cash or debit."}
{"text":"A nice little cosy cafe in Point Saint Charles. Tried some food, coffee and tea. I enjoyed the things they served, they seem to take it serious so that is positive. I didn't have any big meal thought the menu options looked interesting. It is also a great place to work, with space and WiFi. Many people were setup working, but there was still space available. Very eclectic furniture that had a nice ambience. Now the not so great...the area is a bit sketch, but makes Café Bloom even more of a perfect place to get away from the outside."}
{"text":"A neat little Cafe tucked away in la Point, it's a great place to come and do some work (they have internet).  Their lattes are good, and they have croissants from a local bakery that are very French. I haven't tried the other food, but they have a menu of soups, salads, etc. that looks resonable.  The place is open and bright - not at all what I expected for this neighbourhood. Just don't try and drive here on a Thursday morning (until 12pm) - you can't park in half of the nearby streets, and the places you can park are full."}
{"text":"Cozy is an understatement. This adorable café in Pointe-Saint-Charles is the kind of place you could spend the whole day without even noticing it pass by. In fact, it's always an added bonus if you visit while it's raining, just so that you have an excuse to stay for a while. Add to that their delicious coffee, ever changing lunch menu and fantastic weekend brunch, and it's no surprise that it drives such a loyal crowd."}
{"text":"I went to Café Bloom by car because it is quite inaccessible through public transport, and I had quite a high expectation for the place because of its ratings. The location is quite close to Victoria bridge, which attracts some people from afar, otherwise it's really a local café that serves the community nearby. The service was a bit slow but the waitress was nice and friendly. The decor is cute and artsy, with some plants and books and simple tables, highlight is the mosaic counter that looks quite exotic. I wanted to see some of their latte art but didn't get any, and the coffee is very average. Tried their homemade ice-cream sandwich but was a bit disappointed because the cookie is too hard. I find that they have a quite diversified menu, many of their lunch options are Asian food, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, etc. Whereas their brunch, only available in the weekend, is more Western food like waffle, toast etc. If you happen to be in the area, pass by to try but going there on purpose is maybe too much."}
{"text":"I've been to Café Bloom a few times now, and they always seems to be out of something. What's more, the staff is entirely unapologetic about this issue - going so far as to serve us our food in spite of missing ingredients and without mentioning anything. I think most restaurant savvy people would agree: if you're missing an ingredient, inform the client before they pay for their order, or if you find out too late, apologize and attempt to replace it! But don't wait for me to notice something is missing and ask you about it. That's suspiciously like... lying.   It's a much needed cafe/lunch spot for the neighbourhood, but it feels a bit like they are taking advantage of the fact that you have few other options. And that is enough to make me say... I'll just go hungry.   Smarten up your ordering, and remind some of your staff that without customers, you don't have a business."}
{"text":"Un tout nouveau café dans le coin de Pointe-Saint-Charles qui était attendu depuis un bon petit bout. On a l'impression de se trouver dans une grande gallérie d'art et les morceaux affichés aux murs donne l'impression que ça serait un bon endroit pour y faire un vernissage. Ils y servent des petites bouchées et des lunchs faits sur place avec des ingrédients frais, donc ça l'air de changer à chaque jour. Pour les pâtisseries, attendez-vous à ce qu'elles ne soient pas arrivées avant 8h30 environ, mais elles seront extra fraîches et cuites le matin même à Ma Tante Quiche qui est à deux pas du café. Pour ce qui est de la qualité du café, il est correct mais pas nécessairement impressionnant. L'ambiance par contre est parfaite pour ceux qui ont besoin d'étudier, de faire un peu de travail ou bien pour une petite rencontre d'équipe. Il était grand temps qu'un café du genre ouvre dans le quartier!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service. Great coffee. The waffles are probably the best I've ever had. Crispy outside, fluffy inside."}
{"text":"Cafe bloom I love you :-) really really love you. If you live in pointe St Charles and haven't yet been to cafe bloom you are missing out!!!  It's the best place to grab a latte, their lunches are amazing and healthy! I would love to pin point to something specific to eat, but I can't because everything I have tried was great."}
{"text":"I've always appreciated how down-right cute this space is. It also reminds me of the less-pretentious cafes of the Sud-Ouest I would go to when I was small. There's something very warm and welcoming about it, you know? It probably helps that they're really good about their vegan and gluten-free options (and not just tofu scrambles!).  The fact that the portions can often be a little modest for the price is made up by the quality and mindfulness of the food. For the price point I think you'd be hard-pressed to find another place that has such a transparent farm to table explicit menu.  Service can err on the slow side during brunch service so be sure you're not in a rush for your brunch times. Definitely worth it though!"}
