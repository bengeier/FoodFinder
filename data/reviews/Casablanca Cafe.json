{"text":"Got 3 orders of lamb tagine togo  and not even one of three is good. Lamb was smelling very bad like it was cooked may be 4 days back and the rice was kind of like spoiled or paste. Been there few times earlier for dine in and earlier food used to be average even though service was bad. But this time food is completely bad. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Courteous service,delicious food and reasonable prices.  Had the falafel appetizer and lamb shawarma.  The different flavors of the falafel came together well and the lamb shawarma was great- the meat was fresh and grilled to perfection.  Recommend the garlic yogurt sauce.  One of my party ordered the chicken bastilla and we all agreed it was great.  Plan to come back soon, with friends."}
{"text":"Food maybe delicious... But if you are hungry, don't even think of stopping by here! Too much waiting time... I am concluding after a few number of visits. I am writing this as I wait for my next order gets served!!"}
{"text":"Solid- but I wanted more variety. Options are limited, and the appetiser was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Couscous was simply awful. The effort put on the dish was very minimum at it had a bland taste. Disgusting. Other items on the menu... not for me anymore!!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Tangine  was moderate in taste for Mediterranean,  saffron rice was reheated. The dining room needed cleaning. Floors were dirty.  Salt and pepper shakers were sticky with build up, utensils dirty and crusted, paper towel dispenser was filthy with layers of dust. There was no sanitation score displayed anywhere.  When asked, the server presented a filthy broken frame with a 92.5 score. Would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Mosaic Plate as an app and Chicken Mechoui are my favorites!!! must try!!"}
{"text":"I went to Casablanca Cafe on Saturday (02.05.11) and walked in but nobody was there.  After a while someone walked out from the back and he said \"sit anywhere\", but with an attitude.  I ordered the special \"Seafood Pealla Plate\". However, when it came out I began to eat it and I found that I was eating the shell of the mussell.  I told the owner that there was a cracked shell in my plate with pieces throughout the plate. He shrugged his shoudlers and said that \" You have to be careful with pealla\".  I was floored with this response.  I explained that shells are not edible and he said \"that was how we make it\".  He then began to tell me the history of where pealla came from.  I told him to forget the history lesson and I will pay and go.  After paying I left and was miles away when I realized he charged me full price even though I ordered the special, which was at a discounted price.  I will NEVER go back to this place again, and I do not advise that you go either."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and each time the food was outstanding. If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"While I haven't been to Morocco I have spent a number of years living in the Middle East. As a former Middle East resident I have to say that Casablanca does an excellent job of creating an authentic vibe as well as a selection of food that I found to be delicious. 

I had the chicken kebabs with tebouleh which I definitely recommend. 

I plan on returning to Casablanca Cafe again in the near future!"}
{"text":"I spend lots of money on food, ethnic food specifically cause I am a great cook.  If I go out to eat its gonna be wings or something from another country.  This was a long time favorite but I'd say in the last year this place has changed and they have lost me as a regular customer.  The food is ok, but way overpriced and the portions are pretty sad.  Not sure if people know that a 2lbs of couscous cost about $3.00 and it cooks up to enough to feed a family of 4.  So what they are charging for this dish is wayyy off.  I know they use a lot of different spices but none that isn't readily available in America."}
{"text":"Great place.  Very authentic,  complete with moroccan t.v in background.  The bakalava was amazing!  The burgers were yummy (had a extra spices).  The chicken plate I got came with fresh bread.  We stopped during a long trip.  It was not far at all off of the highway.  It's in a small strip mall and doesn't look like much on outside.  This will definitely be a regular stop for us when we are driving through."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall type of place but it doesn't disappoint! Fresh chicken Kabobs and their rice is to die for hands down my go to place for Moroccan food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is always damn slow. Sometimes the servers are.confused as to what is on the menu. A lot of times their actual menu is much limited than what's written on menu card. But yeah, food tastes awesome."}
{"text":"Interesting little hole in the wall in the University area.  It's located in the dying shopping center on N. Tryon (between Harris and Mallard Creek Church) which formerly housed Stool Pigeons.  The ambience is not great.  Fluorescent lighting and lots of ethnic fabric covered benches, and the fabric looks dingy and wrinkled.  

However, the food was great.  We didn't want to commit to eating a full meal so we ordered the appetizer sampler that contains hummus, tabbouleh, falafel, tzaziki, stuffed grape leaves, garlic dip and a cold smoked eggplant dip.  The tabbouleh was fresh and bright with lots of lemon juice - one of the best I've ever had.  The garlic dip and hummus were both very good.  Hummus was perfectly creamy, and the garlic dip had so much flavor I mixed it with some of the other items to boost the flavor in those.  

Service was great, as expected since we were the only table in the restaurant at the time.  The food was fresh, and we'll definitely be back to try more items."}
{"text":"This this place is closed forever  f my life..I love this place..I was really hungry and I went there around 12 midnight and I seen a sign that said places is for lease. I'm really really really starving at that time and I wish I could only eat there one more time :("}
{"text":"After I moved to Charlotte from California it's pretty hard to find authentic Arabic food. I like middle eastern Kabobs in particular. After trying out a few Kabob places in North Charlotte, I was pretty happy with the food at Casablanca. We tried Chicken Kabobs with Basmati Rice. Very authentic and tasty. I have been there 3 times and food is always good. Every time there is only one person working as the place is not that busy. The server is friendly. I recommend this restaurant if you a looking for authentic middle eastern food. It's more like a neighborhood Mom/Pop shop rather than a full restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I am not as versed in this type of cuisine (middle eastern/mediterranean) as I am with other things but have had enough to write a pretty good review...plus i took my 1/2 lebanese gf that can cook the hell out of this stuff.  

Casual dining....they have couches along the walls so it can be very comfortable and \"loungy\" one could say.  

Excellent hummus, falafal, shawarma, kabobs.  Touboulleh and baba.... (spelling) is very good as well.  Stuffed grape leaves are ok...definitely had better though. 

Been here about 4x and had different things each time the food is very good.  Definitely a place to check out if you are new to the type of cuisine or even if you are familiar and want a solid meal."}
{"text":"Limited options but the food is solid.

We sometimes order and just pick it up, the girl who used to work the register wasn't very friendly but theres a new girl now who is easy to talk to.

The kababs are good but not like mama makes. The place always seems empty when I go but there are a lot of regulars."}
{"text":"I loved this place, their mint tea is so authentic I'd have to go on and on about every dish we tried but I was in food heaven. A wonderful place for new experiences"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Interesting menu. Has all the classics and some American infused dishes. I had the beef kabobs and they were fantastic. The included salad was very refreshing and flavorful. Excellent, laid back service. Authentic seating arrangements. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I am so sad to write a 2 star review of this place...I wanted to like their food so much! But, there were some problems, that we just couldn't ignore.

First of all, it was Saturday night, in Charlotte...now, Charlotte is a restaurant town. No where is empty on the weekends, and I don't think anyone stays home on the weekends for dinner!!! This place was completely empty. We were the only customers the entire time we were there. This is a huge red flag, but when we were done with dinner, we understood.

We got the variety plate appetizer. The falafel was nice. Hummus was good. Babaghannouj was pretty good. Their stuffed grape leaves were the best thing we had the entire meal.

Hubby and myself both ordered tagine, I got lamb and he got the fish. The fish was fishy...I like fish, but this just wasn't exactly right, and I can't put my finger on where it went wrong. The lamb was tender but dry...I know that sounds strange too!!! But, it was pull apart tender, but there was no moisture, no succulence...it was ok.

Our other issue is that we wanted \"authentic\" Moroccan food...If you have ever read any of my other reviews...we really really like different foods.

But, when we were ordering the waitress told us that \"authentic\" came with french fries, and the \"american\" style came with rice... This just doesn't seem right to me. But, the rice was nicely cooked and flavored.

Sometimes an ethnic restaurant can suffer from trying to stay too true to their roots, and fall short because the ingredients are lacking here in the states.

But, sometimes an ethnic restaurant can suffer by trying to americanize their menu...and going way too far.

I think this is the problem with Casablanca. With zero customers on a Saturday night, they need to re-think their approach to Moroccan food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for a local book club. Atmosphere is nice and food is good. I'd recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I'm going all out on my 1st visit with 5 stars.   I stopped by midday, around 3 pm, and since I was about the only customer received fabulous service (thx Raian).  My to go order took about 10 minutes to assemble and when I arrived home I was over the top happy! 

Casablanca Cafe reminded me of a visit years ago to Morocco.  I ordered the Lamb Tangine and also a mosaic plate, which is a sampler of their starter courses.  The lamb was falling off the shank and was topped with French fries and regionally correct olives.   Yummy!  The mosaic plate was equally delicious.  I've found a great new haunt for some excellent food from N Africa!"}
{"text":"Such a rip off!! The sheesha was fine until we went to pay... It's cash only and I had American money. The bill was can$15 and when I said I have American only they boost up our bill to us$20. And when I argued it they said that I have no proof whether it should be less or more. So RUDE!!

And by the way, if you look at their recent food and safety inspection they got a yellow tag(conditional pass) meaning the way they handle and serve food is UNSANITARY AND UNSAFE. I didn't eat here but I also wouldn't suggest anyone to eat here either."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential. What they do well - namely, the couscous, gyros and tagines - they do damn-near perfectly. Where they fall short, improvement would be easy and inexpensive. So, like a middle-school English teacher with a bright but lazy student, I'm simultaneously pleased, annoyed, and yet hopeful for progress.

First, the praise. I've tried the baba ganoush just about everywhere in Charlotte you're like to find it. Casablanca Cafe's is easily the best. I simply can't recommend the lamb couscous highly enough. It's truly a thing of beauty; full of big chunks of fresh veggies and a generous size of perfectly seasoned lamb that really does fall off the bone. The French bread they serve with it is a delicious and authentic reminder that Morocco was a French colony until 1956. The tagine is very good and quite authentic, but lacks the vegetables you get in the couscous. For a simple lunch, the beef gyro is fantastic with a creamy garlic sauce. Try it wish their slightly smoky hot sauce. It's called harissa, although the girl at the counter didn't seem to know that. 

A repeated source of frustration is their continued failure to actually provide what is on the menu. Where a side of grilled vegetables is offered you will have to make due with a decent but unremarkable salad. And don't even bother ordering the Moroccan Symphony (assorted Moroccan pastries). They never have it. Seriously, never. Which is a shame, since the mix of French influence and the Islamic affinity for sweets makes Moroccan pastries some of the best in the world. 

I've been coming here since it opened about three years ago. At that time it looked like little more than a gutted Subway whose future was yet to be determined. Since then they've made some small efforts to impart some Moroccan style to the dining room. However, dimming the lights, painting the walls a dark color and draping some fabric like a tent to hide those bland and decidedly un-Moroccan ceiling tiles would go a long way to making the place feel much more authentic. Also, as enthralling as those soap-operaesque music videos they play on Arabic MTV are, there must be a better musical option than Egypt's answer to Ricky Martin's \"Shake Your Bon-Bon\". I just don't know what that could be."}
{"text":"I wish I had gotten the chance to try their food. My husband and I went to the restaurant at 12:30pm this afternoon for lunch. The cafe still had their open light on but their doors were locked. We peered in the window to see the lights on but no one inside: I assumed the cashier had to use the restroom and temporarily locked the doors. We walked around for a couple minutes and came back to find the door locked again, this time when we looked in the window we saw two staff members looking back at us and then ducked/hid behind their curtains. SO RUDE!

I would have been understanding if they left a note on the door, or turned off their open sign, or simply come to the door and told us they were closed. I have worked in restaurants and retail and I have never seen such blatant disregard for potential customers or such rude and childish avoidance! I think I'll stick with Akropolis."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place! I can't believe we have never noticed Casablanca before. I found it while looking through Yelp for a restaurant with vegetarian options. The reviews looked good, it was nearby, so we figured why not? It turns out that it's next to the tattoo parlor my Wife and daughter use, how did I never see it?

I loved the motif, especially the color scheme. More importantly, our meal was delish! We started with an order of falafel, which was served with a yummy sauce. The falafel weren't dry inside, like so many others I have tried. My Daughter (the vegetarian) ordered the vegetable paella, which came out in a steaming hot serving dish straight from the oven. It looked great, and tasted even better. I snuck a taste when she wasn't looking. My Wife ordered a chicken gyro with rice instead of fries. The wrap was toasted, the chicken hot and moist. Delicious. I ordered the lamb shawarma with fries. I was thrilled with the taste, but my favorite part was the wrap. Was it a pita? Not sure. I should have asked. The crunch of the wrap, going along with the tender lamb and veggies was heavenly. It was almost sensual. Wow, it was good.

They are open until 2 AM for the college crowd from across the street, but at noon on a Sunday we were the only ones there. The service was great, our server kept our drinks full and checked on us a couple of times. Like Arnold said, \"I'll be back\"!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple times because I liked the food and the scenery. Last time I went I had hair in my food. I recommend you check your food before eating it here"}
{"text":"Moroccan Tea is HOT with fresh Mint, sounded great so I order one.  This was good though I do not need to order one next time.

Chicken Bastilla ! ! ! The Appetizer was like a Chicken Turnover!  Imagine (and see my photos) pulled Chicken, perfectly flavored sauce, wrapped in thin layers of dough and topped with Powdered Sugar?  Based on this dish the yelp rating is 4.5 stars easily!

A lettuce salad was included with the Entree.  This salad was simple Iceberg Lettuce with a good dressing and a very good mixture of toppings!

My entree was a Chicken Leg (NOT boneless) in a light Curry with small Olives, served with Potato Fries and Fantastic Bread.  The Curry gets 3.5 stars, the fries get 3 stars and the bread gets 6 yelp stars or at least 5!

Tabbouleh is one of my favorite dishes and this one is SUPERB! !! !!! Six yelp stars or at least 5!

For Dessert I had Baklava, it was very good 4.65 stars! 

In case you want to know the Service is Excellent!  The Decor is Totally Moroccan! The Patrons make this place a Lookalota!!!

UPDATE Nov. 18 2012

They said the Bastilla had to be ordered a day in advance!

My Girlfriend and I split the Kabob Platter : Chicken, Beef and Shawerma on top of Saffron Rice!  The Arabian Coffee was better than many Turkish Coffees, very similar!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars - We ate at this restaurant and didn't die!

I too made the most from my trip to Ikea by checking out this place for lunch. Pretty comfy atmosphere for a little hole in the wall, I must say.  The good news is that all the former \"daily specials\" (Mon through Sun) are now available on any day. 

We started with the eggplant dip (not the baba ganoush, the other  one) and it was delicious, an easy 4 stars.

I had the lamb couscous - the first time in 30 years or so!- it's a stew made with lamb shank, squash, potato and I think courgette served over couscous. Not a fancy but an authentic recipe, the portion though was supersized American style. 
3.5 stars

My other half ordered the Chicken Tagine w/rice, which is supposed to be a chicken stew with pine nuts, dates, chick peas etc but here it was mainly a roasted chicken with no sauce - I suspect it was partly stewed first but its just a WAG-  She was a bit disappointed but what was there was pretty good and lots of it,  plus it was served with a bit of really tasty salad and she enjoyed her dish nonetheless.
3 stars  

I drank a hot mint tea and we split a baklava which was OK but for reason had been refrigerated - which I think is pointless. 

.... and we took home a full container of leftovers for our animals. I'm looking forward to trying other items from their menu - and from the Caribbean restaurant next door! - unfortunately that location is fairly distant for us."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. However, twice I've observed the male owners berating the waitresses. The last time, it got loud because a NEW waitress relayed a question from a patron. The owner was actually screaming & cursing at her! WTF! I signaled the waitress over and told her that regardless of finances, SHE should never accept such degradation. The fact that she was petite & soft-spoken, with a meekness to her enraged me; to make matters worse, she actually had tears in her eyes when she returned to the patrons, who were pretentiously puffing away on hookahs, clearly apathetic to what they just witnessed. I told her I'd help her find another job if need be, gave her my cell number & a $10 tip (she wasn't even my waitress, and my food totaled $8). I grabbed my food & bounced before I went Beatrix Kiddo in there.

She texted me 2 weeks later to say she quit one night on the spot and has since found other employment :)

Cultural values aside, basic human decency is non-negotiable.  Discovered the restaurant has a revolving door of waitresses because of this.  Will NEVER eat here again, unless under new & ethical management."}
{"text":"This is not another Fancy Shisha lounge in Toronto... The place settings is very regular, people go there for very casual hang outs.... I like that, cause this is how shisha places should be...
The Shisha taste is the best I tried in Toronto soo far... reminds me of shisha taste back home...
I recommend this place for people who go for the shisha... and not the fancy stuff..."}
{"text":"I quit visiting this place for a while, because the owner opened another location and quality went down in his absence. We went back about a month ago just because it is walking distance, and he was there. He said he decided to close the second location and focus on this one.

There have been decoration updates, but most importantly, the food was back on track. I got the chicken bastilla and it was to die for. Didn't get  my usual chicken brochette so can't speak for it- it had really been suffering. Hubby got kefta and agreed that it was as good as before."}
{"text":"Stopped here after shopping at IKEA.   Food was very tastty. The lamb was grilled perfectly, Even the children's chicken was grilled well"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited on Saturday Dec 14, 2013. It is a nice cool environment. The waiter was a college student that was very friendly and personable. I order the Casablanca Special Combination (platter of Hummus, Babaghannouj, Tabbouleh, Safron Rice, Chicken Kebab and Beef Kebab) he order something similar but it came with a salad. Overall it was good. The Tabbouleh was fresh but I have had better so I will give it a 3 Star...same with the hummas. The Chicken and Beef were excellent. We also had some sweet tea. It was very good. He said they use rose water....very interesting but made it very good."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall kind of place. It's dimly lit, but not too dark to see to eat. The best part of the decor is the pillows! It's nice to lean back in a booth and actually be comfortable. 

The food is excellent. I went with a group and we tried several things; hummus, lemon chicken tagine, mixed grill plate, and couscous. It was all hot and fresh. It's served with toasted bread perfect for getting the last bits of food off your plate. 

This place is also a hookah bar. We are not smokers so this was not good for us. After several people started smoking it got a little too smokey for us. However, we chose to eat here so we can't complain too much. 

**added bonus: if you speak Arabic you can have a good conversation with the owner."}
{"text":"This place is 25 mi. from my house so I would go here again if I was already in the area but wouldn't make a trip there just for the restaurant. 

Pros: Authentic Moroccan, reasonable prices

Cons: slow service, dark and somewhat dingy ambience,"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, I wanted it to be a grubby, undiscovered gem in NE Charlotte.  You know how some seedy ethnic takeout places have first-rate, mind blowing food?  I think this just may not be one of those places.  Or maybe it was just what I ordered.  Kofta Tagine.  The daily special.  Should have been awesome, was just mediocre due to everything (rice and meat) being kind of dried out.  However, their cafe au lait was really good, and the Arabic music videos on the teevee were very entertaining.  I'll probably give it one more try sometime just to see if they make a decent bastilla."}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight with an old friend, found the place on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  While it wasn't bad, it could have been a lot better.  They were doing work on a partition (hammers and drills), and the air conditioning was off.  

My hummus was bland, although my chicken and steak kebabs were flavorful, the baba genouche was about as bland as the hummus.

The best thing was the Moroccoan Mint Tea!  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I came to Casablanca for the first time yesterday and it was pretty good I must say! Having lived in the Middle East, this place was a pleasant surprise. I ordered the Casablanca Shrimp Wrap and boyyyy was it spicy! It was good but it opened up my sinuses LOL. I noticed that they offered hookah, but no one seemed to partake. I may come here and try it out sometime in the future. The space is not as big as I expected, but it is quite cozy. I did give a side eye when I asked for sprite and I was given a can and my fork was in a baggie..... o.O. yea lol The only other thing I can add is that the tv's that are on play Arabic music videos. Meh, I guess that adds to the atmosphere...But besides that, no complaints."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday lunch. I loved the layout and decor. It was very comfortable. I'm used to small plate dishes in Mediterranean restaurants, and was surprised this place wasn't like that. The meals were fairly large. The food was flavorful and appetizing. I will definitely go back and think its a place that all those interested in Mediterranean or Moroccan cuisine should try."}
{"text":"I've been to Casablanca Cafe at least ten times now. I typically go with a small group of friends in the evening (after dark) and the atmosphere is great for it. I almost always order the crispy chicken plate when I go to Casablanca and at the end of our meal we have hookah. But I'm sure, as my friends agree, the other food is just as good.

Staff is very nice and the atmosphere very inviting and relaxing, especially in the evenings. There are a few televisions running Arabic music videos and always some kind of Arabic/Mediterranean beats playing. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best.  We ordered the Vegetable Mosaic as an appetizer.  Each item was OK, but small quantities were squeezed together on a small plate so that it was impossible to taste them separately.  The two tiny dolma tasted as if they came from a can.  SO ordered chicken shish kebab.  It came with a small salad and a large amount of rice.  She was OK with it.  I ordered the Vegetable Paella.  It was the same rice as in the other dish but with some fried vegetable mixed in.  This is not a paella by any stretch and it was quite bland.
The main problem was that all around us people were smoking hookah and the sweet smell was quite overwhelming.  This may be acceptable in a hookah place, but this is a restaurant serving food."}
{"text":"Very delicious kebabs...Enjoyed the Rib steaks a few times. Their Hummus is excellent."}
{"text":"When I first discovered this place, I (or some member of my family) came religiously so I could satisfy my craving for the chicken kabob plate. This meal, to me, was the perfect blend of my favorite stuff: grilled boneless chicken kabob, perfectly seasoned rice and awesome salad. We even braved the terrible service of the girl who used to answer the phone (she was very rude) to come and get this food!

However, at some point they decided to change things around. The rice is now more brown and doesn't have the same perfect taste. The cheese even changed momentarily from feta to mozzarella. I love cheese but I loved feta in this setting more so the change was annoying to me. By far, though, the rice change realllllly got me. It got me so much that I stopped eating here.

Then, I decided to give it another try. To my surprise, the rice was ALMOST back to what it used to be. I was temporarily happy again!! Until, several weeks later, another craving hit and I went back to get takeout and I was given the type of rice that I hate. This ruined the entire meal for me. I actually have not been back again since because I can't figure out what kind of rice they are using on the regular.

In any case, despite my rice saga, the owner is usually very nice when I see him. He recognizes some members of my family and says hi and that is nice also. I do hope the restaurant does well and maybe one day I'll be back (maybe)."}
{"text":"Delicious food -we had the beef kebab, falafel sandwich, chicken Tagine and chicken bastilla. One thing - IF YOU WANT THE CHICKEN BASTILLA YOU MUST ORDER IT A DAY IN ADVANCE!!!! This seemed odd to me but the way the owner explained it was that the phyllo dough had to be scratch made. Still it would have been nice to show that on the online menu!"}
{"text":"Very, very good. Authentic Moroccan, cooked from fresh ingredients and served hot. My daughter is a vegetarian, so she finds places like this and drags the rest of us there. I'll go back any time she asks! I'll even pay her way.

Awesome Babaghannouj, Kebabs, and Lamb. Heavenly aromas wafting from the kitchen. 

The only drawback is the carry-out ambience. They could jack up their prices 50% if they had a dining area with dimmer lights, real china plates, metal utensils, cushy booths, and carpet. Not that that would be a good thing... But it might draw a more upscale crowd.

If you like any Mediterranean food, go try this."}
{"text":"This place has the best Lamb Shawarma in town, try lamb shawarma over rice or hummus & Chicken brochette - you will love every bit of it .. If you like fresh, tasty and delicious Mediterranean food .. This is the place to go .. And its open late night until 2AM everyday .. Very friendly staff and a must go place if you like fresh food and hookah :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious but you can't always count on them to be open when they say they are. But If you can get in it's totally worth it. The food is authentic and the atmosphere is cozy! Try the sampler appetizer. The tuboleh is great ad so is the hummus!"}
{"text":"Our to go place when in college. very near. open till late. quiet."}
{"text":"I visited Casablanca Cafe for the first time yesterday evening and was absolutely delighted. The decor was simple Moroccan/Mediterranean prints and patterns, with pillows everywhere - don't let the strip mall location throw you off; the inside of this restaurant is absolutely adorable. The in-house menu is much more extensive than what you'll find online, and is full of traditional Moroccan/Mediterranean dishes seasoned with cumin and saffron spices. (I had the kafta tagine - small beef meatballs served in tomato sauce with peas and onions ... delicious!) And to top it all off, our server was incredibly helpful: at restaurants, I always want to find a dish that can't be easily replicated (by myself or by another restaurant) and so I lean heavily on the wait staff to help me make my decision; our server was very honest about all the dishes on the menu and proffered his opinion which ultimately led to my decision of the tagine and to our decision about the appetizer. At the end of our meal, he recommended a mint-and-honey tea which was a perfect complement to the rest of the evening's food and drink. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Our experience was not the greatest at this place. We had come late at night. The was quite full and we had to get seats in the basement. This would have been a much better experience had the place not been smelling of sewage. It was suttle, hard to pin point the origin of the odour, but strong enough that we asked the place be sprayed with air freshner.

The upstairs lounge looked really cool, with nice couches and the works. The saving grace of this place was the very good quality tobacco sheesha and the courteous and friendly staff."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I love the fact that this place is open so late. Great late night food when you really don't want fast food. We came here for takeout after a late night at the Flying Saucer. 

We ordered the falafel Arabia wrap with french fries. The wrap was hearty but bland and there could have been some more french fries. I feel like the meat dishes might be better. 

Will come back and order something else to see if anything changes. Cheers!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall my fiancé coerced me into trying.. I really should have passed given the tidiness, or lack thereof, of the place. The kabobs were over cooked and dry. When I told the manager, he simply made excuses that it was just the recipe.. I won't be back.."}
{"text":"Perfect place to chill. Good food, delicious shisha and tea. The staff is super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food!  Best falafel I've had.  Fresh and authentic.  I had a Lebanese babysitter when I was younger who used to cook delicious food very similar to the flavors I enjoyed here.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I have been living in Charlotte for the past year and half now and I have been to a large selection of middle eastern/Mediterranean restaurants.  None of which had the same quality food or the friendly staff that I have known to love at CBC.  The chicken is to die for and the atmosphere of the restaurant has a very authentic feel to it.  I go here a lot and also love the fact that they stay open so late.  Wonderful overall!"}
