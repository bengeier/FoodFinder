{"text":"I can't believe this place was full!  Went for a quick dinner before a movie, had: wakame salad, spicy tuna roll, rainbow roll, and sushi inn pizza. Everything fell short, and tasted pretty bland, except for the sushi inn pizza. On the plus side, it was quick.  Moral of the story: Sushi on Bloor."}
{"text":"I had a very unpleasant experience at this restaurant. The service was horrendous- not a smile, please, or thank you from the waitress all night. When she was clearing plates she waived her finger at a stack of dishes in signal for me to pick them up. Not appropriate. If she had asked me with her words I would not have had a problem. I thought maybe she didn't speak any English, but she spoke just fine (although rudely) when I asked a question regarding the menu. Not only was the service poor, but the food was not delicious, nor filling. The sushi was sub par, the teriyaki salmon was overcooked, and the maki rolls were tiny. The chicken and rice we ordered was not only lacking in flavor, but the chicken was dry, and quite frankly disgusting. We asked to speak to someone about the inedible chicken and when they finally came to our table he was rude and unprofessional. He said he would take it off the bill because he \"didn't want to argue about something so dumb.\" Shocking. I will never go there again, and I would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Prices are good, food is okay (not amazing), staff are friendly and attentive, and the location is great.  I usually go here before catching a movie or after some shopping."}
{"text":"This place is slipping badly. I've been going for many years, and used to be a big fan. But recently they've been cutting quality, and today was the first time I've had a dish I would not order again, it was so poor."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 10 years.  It was my first sushi restaurant experience back then and it got me hooked (traditional Chinese folk don't usually eat raw food so this was a big move for me at the time) .  I have introduced many of my friends to sushi at the Sushi Inn.  The line ups back in the day, before the tsunami of sushi restaurants that opened since, were really long here.  The problem I found was the ventilation and air circulation there was not great.  The fryer is in the middle of the restaurant so your clothes, hair etc always smelled like tempura when you got home.  It really helped when they opened up the downstairs section but the atmosphere was different on the lower level.  So I would often choose a seat near the door but the cold winter air was not good if you sat while people stood practically on top on you while you ate.  The restaurant still has a huge draw from the Yorkville crowd.  Though I don't come as often because my current group of friends are big eaters and they prefer AYCE places.  When I'm in the area and craving for sushi, I still drop in.  Their bento boxes are reasonable, sashimi and rolls are decent quality (a bit too much rice on them than I usually like) but I really like the dragon B... 4 star rating for me :)"}
{"text":"Personally I LOVE sushi! and the sushi at sushi in was fab! as much as the food never disappoints, they always have this one guy working that never fails to look like you're bothering him when asking for more napkins or even just to order again :/ EVERYTIME.  Aside from that its super fast and affordable. They deliver so thats a plus!"}
{"text":"The sushi was kind of fresh, but it was so crowded that I got a headache at the end. It was also too warm inside as you could see they were cooking just beside you.  The service was fine, but nothing special about this place that I would wanna go there again!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE.  The food is fresh fast and very inexpensive when compared to other sushi places and restaurants in the area as well. I always get the gold box and you get sooooo much food for like bucks."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Sushi inn for years. They have very friendly staff and a warm atmosphere. It is very casual and well located. I enjoy their sushi very much and although it's not the most quality, it is in my opinion the best for your money."}
{"text":"The small space doesn't provide the intimate feel it should - it's rather noisy. The food is okay and the service is hurried. Definitely not an exciting new find."}
{"text":"The only thing about this place is the fact that it is cheap, apart from that the food sucks ! Pay up and go to Asuka for decent sushi, enuff said."}
{"text":"The sushi here is just ok, the hamachi is just an insult to the intelligence (some sort of pressed white fish jelly) but that's about it. Come here if you are in the area and need a quick bite, but definitely not a destination place. Host not very helpful and a bit rude as well. Would not seat me until my whole party arrived, when we asked for our preferred table he flatly said no and walked away and sat us near the door, very cold even though no one was sitting at the table we wanted and no one ever did."}
{"text":"A central location, always hopping, and the service is very speedy.  However, the food leaves much to be desired. It is on the low end of what I would call acceptable - fish is not cut with any great care, usually too much wasabi on the sushi, and freshness varies wildly.  So, when I come here, it is because I am in the area already. I would never take a trip specifically to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am here now.  Asked for fatty tuna, not available, asked for uni, sold out as well.  Went for sashimi instead, platter has been sitting there by the serving area for 5 mins and no one has brought it to me.  Udon noodles for the kids are way too sweet.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Sushi Inn is good for two things: pleasing groups with bland palates and delivery.  When you're couching and you don't want to eat pizza, Sushi Inn has a decent selection of healthier options like noodle dishes, salads and sushi. They also keep late hours which means, when a movie lets out late, this is your only choice for sushi in the Yorkville neighborhood.  But, let's be honest, the cuts are gross, the sashimi is slightly pungent and any place that drowns their spicy tuna in mayo, can't be the best of the bunch.  It reminds me of the conveyor belt joints in Tokyo, which are essentially the fast-cheap-and-easy of Japan.   Then again, sometimes that's all you want. On the plus, it's the biggest spot, and they turn it over in a flash so you never wait long."}
{"text":"Want to update with 4 stars for their consistency and quality service for delivery."}
{"text":"The food here is fine. Nothing to write home about, nothing horrible either. Perfectly passable. The menu is quite varied, so it's good for a group so everyone can find something they like.   Service, though, is horrible. Staff is neglectful at best, rude at worst. Having to ask multiple times for water / tea / napkins / etc. is the staple of my very visit. Unfortunately work brings me here often, so I speak from many sample-points. Staff has demonstrated a short attitude (and even rolled their eyes!) and me or my team often!! It is also common to get the wrong order, and then have to wait for 20+ minutes to get your correct order.  In short, if you are craving sushi in Yorkville, I recommend you go to Wow Sushi (a couple of blocks south-east on Charles Street). Sushi Inn is not great."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Sushi Inn (or getting delivery) for many years now. It is one of my top non AYCE sushi places to eat at. Their spicy salmon or tuna rolls are fantastic combined with extremely fresh sashimi (due to high turnover) and reasonable prices make this place a winner.  They are very accommodating if you want to make changes to your rolls (obviously at a charge but only $1-2 more).  Seating is very tight but service is efficient, food comes quickly, everything is fresh and it's in Yorkville. Don't expect western \"pampering\" where the server comes check on you every 10 minutes to ask about your food. Expect to have your water or tea refilled constantly along with many servers bustling around to get you more wasabi or ginger!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great! The service was very speedy and they were constantly trying to make sure our cups were full.  The food came out quick and was good and hot. The Salmon Inn is really good, the salmon was very fresh!  The prices are fair for sushi and great considering the area they're in.  The best part was when I walked out and left my iphone on the table. The guy ran out in the rain and gave it to me!"}
{"text":"Great japanese restaurant find in Yorkville and offers good food and great value. They offer lunch specials which include a number of bento box options. I order the sushi combo (~$8) and my friend order the house special (~$10). Each box came with soup and salad and the portions for the house special was very generous. The sushi combo is great when you don't want to be too full.  This place is very busy for both lunch and dinner, if you have a party of more than 2 people, you might have to wait about 10-15mins for a seat. The turnaround time is pretty quick for the couple times I been there and I think it's definitely worth the wait considering its value and price."}
{"text":"This place is good for their Bento Box. I think its the Gold that we normally order. I like the steak or salmon teriaki with the side of Gyoza, shrimp/veggie tempura, salmon rolls (6), soup, salad, rice, all  for the bargain price of $12.99.  The food generally comes quickly and its always fresh. I have not ordered rolls or a la carte sushi at this place so I have no comments about that.  Its usually jammed packed inside and sometimes there is a wait. The service is good...you get tea or water and they come take your order fairly quickly.  The food comes in a timely fashion.  They also accept credit card.    This is a solid place for lunch and dinner. You leave feeling full and satisfied.  I've been going to this resto for the past 10 years and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I used to like this place, however last time I went there it was a huge disappointment: Silver Sushi platter was dry and seemed like it was left out overnight.  The clam had some dots on it.  Very unappetizing and kind of scary.  Don't think I'll be going back.  It's a shame that these places in Toronto can get away with such a poor quality of food."}
{"text":"Not very spacious, and the food not very exciting Well I guess because it is located in the Yorkville area"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review about Sushi Inn for years. I've gone at least 20+ times and have been disappointed by the quality of the food each and every time. Service is okay. But there is much better sushi in the city! Avoid this place if you can (although it is super convenient when you're in Yorkville). Pretty reasonably priced though, if you're looking for a cheap sushi joint."}
{"text":"Although apparently a staple for many Torontonians in the area, this sushi place is nothing special. First thing you notice when you walk in, it smells fishy. Yes, you may say, it's a sushi place, but fish smell is hardly ever a good sign in my sushi book. Had the veggie combo (I did like that they actually have one), i.e. 6x3 maki rolls (I think) plus miso soup and salad for $ 12.50. Price wise absolutely ok. The salad was just a cheap iceberg salad with a bit of carrot and boring mayonnaise dressing. Soup was good. The maki were fine but again, nothing special. They left an odd aftertaste, fish again? Not what I want after having vegetarian sushi though. Finally when we left we smelled like we had bathed in tempura. Unpleasant.  Service was fast and friendly but couln't make up for the mediocre experience. Wouldn't go again. Surely there must be better sushi places in TO."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my friend here, sushi were OK. I have had better in Toronto and cheaper too. Did not like service and waiters attitude.  They were not welcoming at all. Not going back here for sure."}
{"text":"Went with a big group on a Friday night and had to wait quite a while for a table.  They were really accommodating though and moved tables together for us and rearranged things so we could all fit.  The only disappointment was that they didn't have big sushi boats to share.  I ordered a set of maki rolls and everything was good but nothing was exceptional. The edamame on the table when we sat down was a nice touch.  However, I ordered tea and it never arrived.  Overall a pretty good experience, but for the price I don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I only tried this place out after reading other reviews of the joint on yelp and I don't agree. This is not a place to go for sushi especially in Yorkville, think about a Chinese restaurant from Chinatown and misplaced in a high end neighborhood. It's not worth it and the food isn't great."}
{"text":"Lunch for two, juice for one, tax, tip = less than $20.  In Yorkville.  What?!  I loved this place, and was blown away not only by the pricing, but by the quality of food. I'm not claiming to be a sushi expert, but this was up there with some of the nicest, freshest and most flavourly-balanced sushi I've had. Better even than the well-known and well-renowned cheap Sushi on Bloor.  Huge range of options and combos on the menu as well.  Service wasn't the friendliest, but seeing as I paid next to nothing for an exquisite lunch in one of the most exclusive streets of the city, I didn't really care.  Go here."}
{"text":"This is my sushi place in Toronto. I have tried them all, and ultimately I am always going back to sushi inn. To put it very simply: 1) Sashimi is fresh. I've eaten tons of raw fish over the years, and here you have a constant quality of it over the years, never smelly, never fishy taste.  2) It's not overly expensive. 50$ for two will bring you an absolute feast of sashimi, special rolls and makis. Always going out stuffed outta that place. 3) They have the best dragon rolls in whole city. Be sure to avoid cucumber in your rolls, because the absence of it will give them a more soft,  \"melting\" feeling. 4) There are plenty of servers, so you will never spend a single moment searching for help. This is especially important when you don't have enough time and trying have a quick sushi before going somewhere important.  5) The turn-around is high so you will always get a fresh piece. 6) Bentos are a real value for money, and for a couple of $$ more you can change cucumber rolls for any other from the menu you wish. 7) Spicy scallop maki is awesome 8) Tip for those who feel they need more ventilation: try the downstairs, it's much more air-conditioned ;)"}
{"text":"Few years ago this place had a drop in quality, but recently it's been better. Whatever they did - good job. =)"}
{"text":"I come here weekly; upstairs is always super busy, if you're looking for a more quiet night try the downstairs area. The prices are extremely reasonable, you can't get cheaper than this! The food is amazing, and the staff are always super friendly. Never had a bad experience. My favourite is the spicy salmon maki and any of the bento boxes :)"}
{"text":"heartbroken to write this review - this use to be one of my all time places to go to sushi in TO. In fact i've been forced to look for other sushi places given the past several bad experiences at Sushi Inn - no more!   yes, the place is crowded but that's always been okay with me because the sushi had been so good - one could get over the rest.  the service is speedy - in my experience. They are always rushed so you better know what to order which was never an issue as a regular.  Price - great prices for yorkville. And thats probably why they had my loyalty over the many many years  and the food:  - the sashimi for the most part has been fresh.  - Its the sushi that's been an issue - the rice has been cold and dry - at times its felt like perhaps it wasnt even sticky rice. It was like a massive blob of rice wrapped around - wait for it - you may have to really really look for it - i think, there is some sort of fish somewhere in there! geez, i could go for indian or Thai if i wanted a rice-heavy dish. - the green tea - its usually cold which i guess best compliments the cold sushi - not a good thing.  so i've vowed to myself not to go back there again. its the end of Sushi Inn for me"}
{"text":"The sushi is good but nothing fantastic but at least the quality and service are always consistent.  This is one of the better sushi restaurants in the area and it's quite reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Sushi Inn is definitely not fancy, nor does it fit in with the swanky digs of the high end shoppes on either side. It is always busy, has affordable lunch specials and they will do separate bills. Therefore it is always full of shoppers and office mates on lunch break.  Unfortunately it is unbelievably inconsistent and the quality is hit or miss. I visited twice recently with coworkers. The first time was horrible, the second more than decent. The most recent visit we had good service, were seated right away and were given separate bills. The waitress came to us with merchant machine in hand which is nice as well. The service was efficient, but she was not particularly warm by any means.   Last visit I has a side order of Sashimi which was fresh, nice texture. I also had an order of Udon Soup. Lots of veg, Lots of Noodles, could barely finish the portion which is good in my books.   Definitely no-where-near my first choice for Sushi or Japanese in Toronto, but if in Yorkville, it is quick, affordable and with that kind of turnover you are guaranteed some freshness - If you come on a good day."}
{"text":"Always fresh, fast and friendly service, and the atmosphere is relaxing. Great spot to get away from the buzz of the downtown."}
{"text":"Nothing special, sushi is tat better than buffet sushi. Super busy, waitress are like zombies"}
{"text":"I have only been here once, yet they have made a memorable impression. One of the best sushi places in the city. Price is reasonable for a restaurant that is in Yorkville. I remember there was line-up during lunch, and the food was very good. Would love to go back there again."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, the only reason it is busy is because of the location. Very mediocre fast food style sushi, terribly rude staff and management. Every time I have eaten here, I have left feeling ill. This is not a clean place. Their other restaurant on Yonge just south of Gerrard is just as bad."}
{"text":"Good price, it's always fresh and the order comes quickly. You can see the Chef preparing your meal and the staff is friendly. I have also ordered to go and used their home delivery as well, each time my order was perfect, delivered on time and just as delicious as when I dined in."}
{"text":"Can I say something??  I guess I can..  1. Stop checking out young girls when they come. Im here to EAT.. it's very uncomfortable to eat when every second some old Chinese dudes are giggling and looking at me!!!!!!!!! SERIOUSLY. We ate and left RIGHT AWAY.  2. The waiter's attitude is just HORRIBLE..... I didn't even get the menu until I ASKED FOR IT... after been sitting their for 5minutes  3. Waiter gets the orders WRONG  I guess the food is OK, its like sushi on bloor... I think they are the same chain, yeah??? The sashimi was a LITTLE fresher than Sushi on bloor... but overall experiences is just as HORRIBLE as sushi on bloor.  never go back there again.  If I have choice, this place gets either 0 star or even NEGATIVE ratings.  cheers,  Y"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you need to save money but fill your stomach quickly. It always seems to be jammed full of budget travellers and students who want food court quality sushi in a sit down restaurant for less than $10.   Honestly, a couple of the underground sushi takeaway places have fresher/tastier fish and because it's takeaway you don't have to deal with the terrible attitude of the servers"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is not ranked better.  It does an absolutely killer business so all of the fish is incredibly fresh.  They make it very quickly and the atmosphere is decent, especially if you want a break from the normal pretentiousness of Yorkville.  I highly recommend the Spicy Tune, assorted Tempura and yam avocado rolls.  The butterfish sashimi is very nice too if they have it."}
{"text":"Everything here was great. Quality was good. Try the salmon pizza. Restaurant little smelly, that's my only complaint. Service was great. Don't expect to try different types of fish at this place, they only serve the basics: salmon, tuna, etc."}
{"text":"Date Visited: August 23, 2013  Pictured above is a takeout B2 Party Tray ($53.00 - 16 Nigiri sushi, 52 Maki sushi).   Not sure why this place is busy as it is or why it is rated so well.   When it came to freshness, all the sushi pieces were sub-par. The fish was fishy and dull in colour - not very appetizing. One would think that a higher volume place wouldn't have this problem. What grade of fish are they getting in?  The fish here is even worse than some all-you-can-eat sushi establishments.   Further, this party tray didn't have any value. So many maki pieces were tiny and uninspired. Come on, 12 cucumber maki???  The salmon and tuna maki only offered the one ingredient in the roll and so weren't very exciting on the palate. Those maki were basically maki that you would get as part of a bento box meal and not a party tray.   One word: gross."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.   I've been to Sushi Inn three times in the past few months hoping it would get better.    It didn't.  The ventilation is poor and I've left after each visit smelling like a deep fryer.  The sushi is so/so, nothing to get excited about.  Chunks of Tuna sat frozen next to the artificial crab.   Service is indifferent at best.    Toronto is a fabulous food town but there are far better restaurants than Sushi Inn."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, and taken out a couple as well. The prices were great, but I think they've gone up a lot as it's become more popular. My favourite times to go are during off days, as it can get quite busy during rush hours. On the quiet days, service is that of a 5 star restaurant; quick, attentive, and caring. During the busier hours, they seem to do their best but it does lack quite a bit in perspective.   The miso soup here is the best I've had, and the sushi is packed full of protein and flavour. I have found that the food is about 10x better in the restaurant than in take out, so I've just made a point in venturing out to eat there."}
{"text":"Cannot speak for their sushi rolls, as this is my favourite place to go for when I am craving a bento box. For such a filling meal in Yorkville, the prices are good, the restaurant is cozy and always bustling, and the quality has never disappointed over the past 4 years I have visited it.  Staff is low profile but always  curteous"}
{"text":"I gave Sushi Inn 3 stars but unfortunately it was out of 100 stars. Clearly the chef took online correspondent sushi courses in his spare time. I would also assume he injured his palate in some sort of taste bud tragedy. To be fair the beer was excellent and they don't charge much for the Alpo slop they deceptively call sushi."}
{"text":"Providing fast service, fresh sushi and reasonable prices, Sushi Inn meets most people's main requirements for a sushi restaurant. It's usually very busy so sometimes finding a table can be hard."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Inn. It's tidy and organised with plenty of seating; the prices are affordable (especially for the area); and I've been impressed with the selection of food. In particular, this is a GREAT spot for vegetarian options; at most Japanese restaurants I have to pass up the udon noodle soup because it has fish or chicken or something in it, but here they have several vegan options, including an absolutely lovely shiitake mushroom udon soup. Very much recommended!"}
{"text":"The great thing about this place is that it is open until midnight. It is also located in a very nice area.Their sushi is very fresh, and you can watch them while they are making it. They also serve green tea with your food (something I personally really enjoy). This restaurant is clean as well."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for over 15 years. I remember coming here as a kid. We'd come here for dinner and then go for our evening walk (well I was probably on a toy bike) around yorkville/bay/bloor area. And I still do that with my family. I love this place dearly. Delicious and fresh [sea]food and attentive staff. If a friend wants to eat good japanese food, this is the place I take them.  My favorites are the chirashi, unagi don, fried softshell crab, and sushi pizzas."}
{"text":"As I work on Yorkville for lunch I often come to Sushi Inn. It is busy place, but service is always fine. But most important is food - ALWAYS freshly done & very yummy. ))))) Not a dressy place, but good combo of great food & reasonable price."}
{"text":"Went back to this popular place on Cumberland. The food is not too bad, but definitely not a high-quality sushi place. It's just popular. The waitress this evening was pretty rude. English wasn't too good. Overall the service wasn't bad in terms of expediency. Not my favorite place, but when I'm in Yorkville and  feel like sushi, I  tend to go there."}
{"text":"The service is fairly poor. Because it is always so busy, you feel rushed when you eat there. The prices are not bad (especially for import beer - only 4.50!) but there are better sushi in the area!"}
{"text":"Was a great place just to pop in to grab a bit sushi was good seemed fresh service was good ! Great for a date and wasn't to to pricey!"}
{"text":"For a Yorkville restaurant, it is remarkably unyorkville.  First when you scan the menu, you will notice that you will actually be able to afford the food here. So instead of using your VISA, you can dig into your wallet for whatever cash you got.  There must be an international sushi restaurant code, where everyone who works in one must dun a tacky sushi restaurant uniform. The ones here look like they were made from bedsheets. This is a cramped, and narrow place. It is almost always crowded with patrons, and almost as many service staff.  I've come here a dozen times, to suffer the uncomfortable environment for their affordable, and decent food. The menu is just like any other sushi restaurant, and the prices you pay are very uptown. The staff here are friendly, despite each of them looking like they're on the verge of a physical meltdown. The traffic in such a confined space is overwhelming. I counted a total of 16 staff, including five chefs in the open kitchen. It literally feels like I'm dining in a fish tank.  One will forget that they're in Yorkville, once they've joined the school of patrons here. It's not the Ritz. But the fish is alright.  I sat across from a lady who was devouring her tampura like a hungry shark. I guess there was no reason to care for table manners here anyway.   One of the waiter girls was totally checking me out.  So, I'll come back."}
{"text":"For the price, you can't expect too much. Service is great, tempura is fried fresh (yum!) and the sushi is great after a day of pounding the pavement.  The prices aren't so bad ($20 including tip for tempura and a full meal), and even though it isn't the most amazing Japanese food in Toronto (try ND Sushi Grill or Japango), it is good enough.  I will say that it's a step up above those really dirt cheap places like Fujiyama Sushi on Baldwin."}
{"text":"I usually drive to my usual spot outside of Toronto.  Found my new replacement.  It was extremely fresh and extremely well cut.  The salmon was sliced a little thicker than it should have been but I'm not complaining.  I wish my Oyakodon came with more sauce though.  It was good and clear, mainly chicken, onion, sliced scallion and egg.  Just wish it had more sauce... :(  Still, this is my new sashimi joint."}
{"text":"Good value in the heart of Yorkville.   While there is nothing particilularily special about this sushi joint it is a good go to spot in Yorkville that won't have you breaking the bank.    Sometimes the place smells greasy (which can follow you home) but the value here is good and you can walk away with a satisfied belly for about $20/pp, even less for lunch of course.   My personal favorites are the sashimi platter and the rolls wrapped in thinly sliced cucumber. The fish is not the best quality which is why I ended up giving 3 stars but it wouldn't deter me from going again."}
{"text":"Decent sushi place in Toronto. Nothing to rave or complain about. For a restaurant in Yorkville, it is reasonably priced. Good lunch spot during the weekdays. Since there was no wow factor, I have to give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"One star because I have to.  Food is good, service is efficient but what they lack in personality negates the good. I'm always astounded by the rudeness...if you don't like your job...quit! if you're having a bad day...hide it..because if you don't have customers you don't have a business. I have been coming here for years but after this last round of rudeness I am sworn off this restaurant...there are way too many places in this city to have to deal with this!"}
{"text":"For a sushi restaurant in the Yorkville area, the price is not too bad. Portions are decent if you order one of the lunch bento combos.  Can't really compare the quality of the sushi with what I'm used to- so it's definitely a 3 Star review"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for more than a year now. It's pretty consistent with service, quality and price. Once or twice the food was not fresh but not bad for takeout. Not a fan of eating in since the tables are so cramped and close together. It's always packed which means good turn over for fresh sea food. Yorkville crowd without the Yorkville prices. Once they messed up my take out order but quickly compensated me with a free dish for my next order. This is my go to place whenever I want good but cheap sushi that isn't all you can eat. Love the gummed they give with the cheque!"}
{"text":"A treasure tucked away in Yorkville, as a UofT student on a budget this is one of my go-to places to eat that is close to campus (importantly, nearby the ROM). I have taken friends here a number of times and they all have had positive experiences here.  Pros: - Good value, and filling. I generally get the Gold Bento for $11.25 (dinner hour). This includes miso soup to start, 3 small pieces of cucumber roll and 3 pieces of salmon roll, deep fried dumplings, spring rolls, tempura, rice, salad, and your choice of meats (chicken, salmon, deep fried pork, or beef.. I recommend the teriyaki salmon) - Reliable and consistent. Since I basically order the same thing every time, I have found the taste and quality of their dishes have been consistent over time. - Friendly and efficient service. Food comes quickly, fresh and hot. - Great location! Summertime strolls up and down Cumberland are very pleasant, and this place is very close to the ROM, as well as all the shops along Bloor Street  Cons: -  The tables are too small, and too close to neighbouring tables. You feel like you are getting a little to close for comfort with the stranger beside you. Often it feels like a jig-saw puzzle trying to ensure that the multiple bento boxes on your table are not sliding off. However, I understand that they are trying to be economical with the little space that they have.   I hope for many returns to this lovely place :)"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable price, under 15 dollar bento box for dinner, really great value"}
{"text":"Sushi Inn is my go to place when I can't decide what I want to eat or even when I can decide on what to eat but choose Sushi Inn instead anyways.   There is almost never a wait. The staff is nice enough but don't expect any added chatter unless of course you engage the waitress. On some occasions I've struck up conversations with my waitress which led to extra candies in the end with my cheque (woohoo!) and other times when I just wanted to enjoy my meal quietly (although its never really quiet there) they would leave me be.   The food is good. I wouldn't say fantastic nor the freshest but its good in the sense that the high traffic means the turnover of sea creatures is quick. I have been here once or twice when the food was not up to par but about 80% of the time I've visited; I have left satisfied. The price point is fantastic for Yorkville. I live in the area so in a year I frequent this restaurant more than a dozen time.   The gindara is probably what brings me back to this specific restaurant. Everything else on the menu is standard dishes I can find at other sushi restaurants. My order has always arrived quickly and in the past 4 years they have never messed up my order no matter how many alterations I've made.   Love this place. Would definitely recommend but probably not for large parties as you will have to squeeze in."}

{"text":"Good for: quick - convenient - sushi - lunch. Nothing else. Keep this in mind and you will not be disappointed.  Full Stop.  Oh, maybe one more thing... There's two separate doors - upstairs & downstairs - same restaurant."}
{"text":"Aaaahhh so, I came here out of necessity with my co-workers for a Christmas lunch on December 22nd and I will NEVER be back. Out of necessity because one of my co-workers needed a quick lunch because she had to be back to the office before 1pm. We would have rather went to Yamato but they were booked up so sadly we were forced to come here if we wanted something fast.   I'm going to cut to the chase because this incident bothered me to the core. I actually was crying at work and at home because of it, and had to explain what happened to my co-workers. We quickly get our food and the server who, let's be honest, was not there for his table side manner and was quite consistent in being curt with all of us comes over to meet one of the kitchen staff who helped serve the food because it was busy. They both come over and she has the three bento boxes in both hands. She proceeds to go and hand me one, the first one, he quickly leans in over my shoulder and snatched it from and says \"hak gwai\", she catches on and he puts the dish meant to be served to me first in front of my one co-worker sitting beside me, she puts the next one in front of my other worker sitting diagonally across from me, and I get the last one. Like I am a dog or something to be served last because yes, despite my light complexion, I. AM. BLACK. Mother black, father half black, raised in a very black household thanks. And he noticed. The pig he was. Yes you, the server with the one front tooth he can't keep in his mouth. You thought that I wouldn't understand what you were saying but my husband worked at a VERY popular Chinese take out joint for more than 10 years. He knows ALL the cuss words and is very able to cuss a Chinese person out in their native tongue. You nasty racist judgemental piece of something. Because I didn't want to show out, I gave you a bigger tip than you deserved because I knew that you insulted and were stereotyping me. I mean, I couldn't even pay first, lmao! You choked on you own spit because I most likely tipped more than my co-workers, who by the way if you haven't guessed yet...where white. You then said, feeling shocked and surprised, Merry Christmas!! Well, go f yourself!  If you're black, don't eat here. It's like all I wanted to do was enjoy a quick lunch with co-workers and I had to experience this bull because he thought I wouldn't understand what he was saying. This is not the first time this has happened to me in a Chinese food restaurant and the last one I confronted the owner about it and she stuttered trying to say it's not meant in a bad way. But if you say it in a way that alerts another server that somebody is black in order to serve them last, then that's racist, just like the kitchen staffer that walked past me and my son at the other establishment that my family and I frequented for like 20 years and said that out the side of his mouth. I've stopped going there as well. Sushi Inn will never see another dollar of mine, even if in a bind and h*ll should freeze over. I couldn't even keep myself together at work. I do hope the owner sees this, I know the server with the front buck tooth who is easily identifiable will probably deny this. It's unfortunate someone who looks like him thinks he can judge me but I am not surprised you should have saw the cooks my husband worked with and heard the things they would say about black people. From the gutter.   For those who don't know...knowing is half the battle. Hak gwai: A Chinese (Cantonese) slang to describe persons of African descent. The slang is often used in a derogatory manner, but may be used for humor as well."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Sushi Inn last night.  It got to our place in about 20 minutes, which is always welcome when you're starving.  We ordered a lot of sushi between the two of us, and they packaged them in two separate plastic bags which was nice because we weren't sharing.  My dining companion doesn't like avocado (I know, I know...) and they honoured his insane request to not get any avocado in his dishes.  I enjoyed my ikura nigiri a lot, and I liked that they put the salad dressing in a separate side container.  I did think they put too much rice in their handrolls, and that in general the rice-to-fish ratio was too high on the rice side.  That being said, a lot of times sushi does not travel well via delivery, and I thought everything tasted as I expect it would if we were in the restaurant.  Would order again from there if I'm in the neighbourhood for speedy delivery."}
{"text":"I come here often. It is reasonably priced, the service is good, and the food is always great.   I recommend the seaweed salad, the hotake set, the platinum sashimi, Dragon roll B, and the Salmon salad roll. These are CONSISTENTLY GREAT!  If it's your thing, the beef roll (cooked beef wrapped around mushroom) is really yummy too.   The sushi inn is typically busy, so you may want to make a reservation. They also deliver."}
{"text":"Not a good sushi place in my experience. Crowded, a little expensive. The taste is okay."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday afternoon, the place was pretty busy compare to a ghost town Toronto core so I figured it would be good.  I was gravely disappointed, while the prices were low, (was that why it was busy while other restaurants dead?) there was a good reason. The quality poor and portions small. Also we order the Gold set which at Sushi on Bloor would be enough for 2 people, it was small and even ordering a whole bunch of other stuff, it was barely enough for us. And the items in the set were awful, tiny California roll pieces and fake crab meat. Overall the taste was poor.  It totaled just over $40 for two of us for lunch."}
{"text":"I came to Sushi Inn on Friday and it was okay.  The ambiance was nice and the restaurant seemed busy.   I ordered a sashimi combo. The fish was okay but it wasn't the fresh melt in your mouth variety. All over the food was okay but I wouldn't give this place 5-stars.   I also asked the waitress if we could have a teapot on our table since I kept calling her over to refill my glass. She abruptly said no. I was surprised by her reaction. I thought that would save her work but she wasn't cool with that. Every time I asked for more tea I felt bad because she looked kind of annoyed.   They also seemed kind of stingy. I asked for more ginger since I can't use soya sauce and the other waiter immediately pointed out that I had some more on my plate. I had to wait until I finished all the ginger before asking for more. When I did ask for more, the waiter seemed shocked that I made the request.  My friend enjoyed his food. He ordered chicken and a spicy tuna roll.   I would give this restaurant 2.5-3-stars. Since I had wonderful company, I will round my rating up to a 3."}
{"text":"My go-to place for sushi in yorkville. Reasonably priced and fresh. Spicy salmon rolls are really yummy. Always really busy but don't have to wait too long for a table."}
{"text":"Sushi Inn is my favorite sushi place in Toronto! The prices are great, their food has always been fresh and delicious. The location is just perfect and I always stop by when I go shopping in the area. (nota bene) I'm happy for the young guy that works there that his English is improving :D"}
{"text":"Since this place is in Yorkville, I had high expectations.  Their lunch specials aren't great -- they also lack vegetarian lunch options.  I believe they have one and it is like a fried vegetables dish, as opposed to a maki set.  I ordered a yam roll and a kappa maki.  The yam roll was decent, nothing to write home about but a fair size.  The cucumber maki was like something from a pre-packaged sushi booth at a grocery store!  I just found it really surprising, the pieces were so small.  Overall, I was not that impressed.   Also, when we arrived there was this awkward moment.  They offer to seat us at the front (there are two tables for 3 by the window) so we go to sit but the other table is moving and they ask my group and I to stand back to let the others out, but they'd already showed us to our seats?  I can't explain it well on here but it was just an awkward dining experience."}
{"text":"I just love this place.  While the service is nothing to write home about, the food speaks for itself. Servers seem grumpy most of the time, but are always quick and accurate with orders.   It isn't 5 star sushi by any means, but for the price, you get great value and freshness. I often get the bento boxes which have some kind of teriyaki, sashimi, maki roll, and the standard soup and salad for about $13. The portion is great and you can't beat that price in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Went in during the lunch rush - service was good in that we were seated and our orders taken quickly; soup & appetizers came quick as well, but the food took a bit to come. Place was packed, so shouldn't be surprised. The food is okay - not great, but not bad either. Teriyaki was pretty good, but it's really the prices that get you to come here; $9 for a huge amount of good food (soup, sushi, full bento).   Some people complain about the service - I didn't see a problem. Some people in Toronto love having their hands held all the time ..."}
{"text":"Food is passable (the chicken age isn't too bad, nor is the avocado and yam maki), though (like many have said) service could be a bit friendlier.  I had ordered a small bottle of sparkling water while my husband ordered Coke.  Guess whose drink didn't come?  The restaurant makes up for its price points, which is dirt cheap by Yorkville standards, as well as the chicken age."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because we were dressed a little too casual for a higher end restaurant.  The place was not busy and not empty, which was a good sign.  My friends had the premium bento box which was priced very well for what they got and I got the premium sashimi dish.  Food was good, nothing special, nothing really stood out.  Your average sushi place."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch after our Run. The service was friendly, efficient, and all of the food was just being prepared made fresh to order. I ordered a bento box with chicken terriyaki, gyoza, tempura, salad, soup, rice, and delicious salmon rolls. Everything tasted wonderful and the price was pretty decent at $10 ish for the box.  The yelp reviews are always accurate and I will never doubt Yelp ever again... haha! This place is good for quick and cheap sushi."}
{"text":"Visited on Sat Nov 22 at 8pm. Ordered the premium sushi it was enough food for two people. Didn't get to make reservations, we were seated quickly. One of the few places where you can have BROWN rice for the rolls for $1 more. It has been tough to find sushi places that can do this, most offer white rice only.   Tables are a bit too close together which meant the people next to use were listening to our conversation, and we could hear theirs. It was bit noisy when we got there, got a bit more quiet after 9:30pm.  tables are also a bit small, we ordered only one item, with soup, salads and drinks it was very full. Food was fresh and tasted good. The plum wine is quite good if you're never tried it before, sweet and tangy.   Service was friendly and fast. Would come back again. Total was only $30."}
{"text":"My partner loves the cold soba noodles here. Generally, I find this place okay. It's clean. The service is fast. It's not the friendliest place. The staff don't really talk to you. The fish is decent quality. They do have some lunch deals. Otherwise, there's nothing to really rave about here. It's an okay spot, that will do in a pinch. I've recently gotten into seaweed salad and I felt like the one I had here, while tasty, wasn't the best I've had. That about sums up how I feel about this place over all."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place: Location, Location, Location. I mean common Yorkville need I say more?  Also right out of a subway station, if you chose not to drive to avoid those parking fees.   Now, the sushi is decent. It won't make you want to jump for joy but it will satisfy your tummy.  The service is always friendly, and since they have to floors you can decide yourself which one you decide to line up for, yes you will have to line up for this place.  I personally prefer the downstairs as it has more of a chilled atmosphere and upstairs they also do take up so its always busy with people running around."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I came to this sushi spot after my sister and I used to dine here during our school years. In order to maintain an establishment there has to be consistent service and quality food because eventually the ratings will go down and it sure did. I remember the last time my sister and I came here, we had a bad experience with the quality of service. However, this visit on Sunday was a bjt better only because my bf and I came here right when it opened so it wasn't busy and you are expected to get fresh food. We both ordered the Sushi Inn lunch special which came with a maki set. In the box, there was chicken teriyaki (overcooked and tasted like rubbery ends of a chicken), gyoza, spring roll, tempura, and salad. I think the best part of this meal was the miso soup. It was tasty and loved the abundance of tofu in it!  The box was mostly fried stuff so thats why the restaurant was pretty smoky since they have a lot of fried or deep fried menu items.  Come here if you want a cheap decent lunch but dont expect quality food all the time."}
{"text":"It's a very bare minimum Japanese style restaurant. Don't have high expectations. What I find interesting is that every time I go, whether it is summer or winter, I feel like I need to wear shorts and a wife beater, because it is so darn hot inside."}
{"text":"I didn't mind this place. Overall it's a standard sushi joint in a pretty snooty area so when people say it's 'cheap', I would say it's regular priced in a much higher-priced area.  The sushi was good, I got the Gold Sashimi Plate and while it came with a bowl of rice and Miso Soup, I found it has WAY too much grated carrot under it, made the plate look much bigger than it actually was. The Sushi plates looked much better.   Service was 50/50. When I first walked in I didn't feel overly welcomed. We had a party of Seven which we made a reservation for but still had to wait 15 minutes to be sat down. There weren't any smiles or welcomes when we arrived and delivering/collecting dishes was done usually quite abruptly and sometimes awkwardly.  I would say overall that I can get the same sushi and better service elsewhere so I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. The only highlight was the 'Sushi Pizza'. That was delicious"}
{"text":"Service ok. Price ok. Food not delicious but decent! Ok for what you are paying for it."}
{"text":"This place hands down has the best miso soup I've ever had in Toronto. They also have really good lunch specials here. Definitely the best bang for your buck here is the Combo I. You get enough food for 1.5~2 meals for the price of one.   Ever since I've been going there, the service has been fast and fairly decent too. Both water and tea are free and they're not stingy with their refills.    In terms of food, Sushi Inn has really good tempura. Their sushi is fairly average but well-portioned. Their udon could use some work.   Overall good place, and great prices for a location like the heart of yorkville. Have been a regular since 2014 and plan to keep it going strong!"}
{"text":"The quality of the fish is 4/5 and the prep 5/5.     Has been consistent over the years. A solid 4 out of 5, the prices are very reasonable. Everything I have ordered here is good. The Beef teriyaki with rice, the sushi rolls, soups, bacon wrapped asparagus and on.   For better grade fish/Sashimi I would go to Asuka one street over.    Out with friends and a king can of Sapporo this place has a good vibe, service is efficient and pleasant."}
{"text":"Not so bad. Felt like it taste like a lot of other sushi places. Was expecting to taste better since its in the yorkville location.  I had assorted sashimi boat. Miso soup. Seaweed salad. Cucumber sushi rolls. Tempura dry squid."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto means trying new and interesting food! Figured we'd give sushi a try while we're here. We were in the neighborhood and getting hungry so we stopped here for lunch. Extremely inexpensive! Atmosphere isn't bad, either. It was busy but comfortable.   I ordered the Combo I (spring roll, chicken teriyaki, rice, and some fried stuff). It comes with Miso soup which is delicious. As well as a side of little salmon and cucumber rolls (which were good, too!) My meal was quite large but it was mostly deep fried things, like sweet potato slice (?) and zucchini slice (?) and a few other things I couldn't quite figure out but was too hesitant to try. I was mostly excited about the chicken teriyaki and spring roll. My spring roll was about an inch long and a half inch wide, extremely tiny!!! And the chicken tasted like very poor quality -perhaps the rubbery thigh meat? I couldn't bring myself to eat more than a couple bites of the mysterious deep fried items.   It was a nice stop for where we were at the time but next time we will plan better and find a better sushi joint along the way!"}
{"text":"I LoVE SUSHI INN!  The thing that makes me love Sushi Inn is the Sushi Pizza and the Gyoza dumplings.  The Sushi Pizza is something I've mostly encountered in Tdot, but it is delicious and fatty - crispy deep fried circle of rice with salmon sashimi, some onions, and plenty of those little orange egg things sprinkled on top, as well as a healthy dose of that mayo they use. Mmmmm.   The Gyoza is in a crispy deep fried batter - NOT like those pot-sticker things you can buy frozen in Costco.  Every time i'm in Tdot I eat Sushi Inn food. And not necessarily at the restaurant. They have EXCELENT delivery service and it is nice to be a glutton and binge on sushi pizza, gyoza, of course other rolls too, wherever you might be.  YUM!"}
{"text":"I am just trying to get take out and the service was insanely poor with people glaring at me and not explaining the menu clearly! This is ridiculous and I would not come back again for anything"}
{"text":"Still got the best and freshest sushi. One thing that has changed: THE BATHROOMS! They renovated the bathrooms and are not equipped with a new sink and new tiles and paper towel dispenser. HUMONGOUS plus in my books.   They also now have more than just mango flavoured jellies, including apple, strawberry, orange and grape!   To try: sushi inn roll (it's not as packed as they were before but still a must-try), oyako don (mushrooms, eggs and chicken on top of a bed or rice, REALLY good) and the cold soba.  Still in love with Sushi Inn and still in love!"}
{"text":"Hand's down best value for money Japanese restaurant in all of Yorkville.  Yes, it might not be the best, but where for $12 you can get a soup, salad, sushi, tempura, rice, chicken, etc as part of a combo in Yorkville.  Hat's off to you guys; I recommend you to all my friends."}
{"text":"Decently priced and delicious. Staff are exceptionally friendly and accommodating. Great for dinner. One of the best places to come to for comfort food. Great location (being in Yorkville) without the pretentiousness or the prices of other restaurants within Yorkville."}
{"text":"I expected a lot considering the reviews. The food was ok, the price was ok and the seating was very tight. The service was junk. Seated and waited forever for someone to come and take the drink order. When we ordered our food, the server said that we were ordering too much food. When asked if it would be problematic to take it to go if we did not finish it, he literally rolled his eyes and said do whatever you want. He told us we only had an option of vegetables or mushrooms for one of the combos, even though the menu said shrimp. They brought me an extra drink out of no where, I sent it back but was charged for it still because it technically came to my table already. Thankfully d.t. Toronto has plenty more sushi places."}
{"text":"The food came quickly.    The octopus balls were mostly breading.   The rest of the food was good.   The server was not around except when it came to tip time."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never gotten around to reviewing sushi inn. This was my regular spot for years and then it started to slide a bit.  The speed of service and location are pretty sweet but overall the food is just mediocre. The fish can be spotty on freshness. It is decent value and that's really why they pack it in. The sushi salmon pizza and sushi inn roll are solid.  Don't expect high quality here but you could be worse."}
{"text":"Very affordable sushi in normally expensive Yorkville. The service is always good, in fact, the last time I went I had the friendliest server who loved trading stories about our pets. I recommend the sushi pizza especially."}
{"text":"Great prices, fast service, good but not great sushi. We casually went and saw the olace full, so we thought it was a good spot. Try the Mango Dragon Roll."}
{"text":"Not recommended. Food is really soso. The cook chiefs talks all the time when making sushi without any mask. It is noisy here. The takiyaki is really terrible"}
{"text":"Decent food & that's where my compliments end.   When it comes to sushi, I have experienced better quality at several other restaurants. The prices are surprisingly low for sushi and that too, in the Yorkville area. We were seated on the second story, and I found the decoration and atmosphere crowded, but more than acceptable. The service however, was terrible.  The waitress was ice cold. She forgot my friend's request for a glass of water twice. After dinner, when two of my friends paid with cash, the waitress did not ask the customary, \"do you need any change?\". I think that's an important question for good service. Usually, it'll leave the customer feeling thanked, and they end up refusing, but I guess maybe the waitress was too afraid someone would say, 'yes'?   Anyway, we weren't thanked when we were walking out the door, either and the waitress was simply standing there watching us walk by.   All in all I would go back if I were in Yorkville with a small budget, empty stomach and low expectations."}
{"text":"Price is reasonable, portions are good and food came fast. Had lunch here and had the sushi inn special. Was 11 bucks for 3 each of salmon and cucumber maki, chicken teriyaki, soup, rice, tempura (shrimp, eggplant, crab, sweet potato and 1 spring roll), salad and dumplings.   They premake the maki, but it is fresh because the table turnover is so high. Dont expect blow out of your mind food, but good for a working lunch. Was im and out in under 30min.  Ive eaten here many times over the past 3 years and food has always been consistent. I gave it a 4 because when i consider price, location, service, esthetic looks, quality and quantity, it is great."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends for lunch a few weeks ago and was kinda let down. It was a bit pricey for what they offer and it didn't feel worth it. I ordered the katsudon which is basically pork cutlets over rice and it was average at best. The katsu was soggy and paired with the rice it didn't taste like anything special. I don't recommend this place for any of the donburis."}
{"text":"Sushi Inn is one of my favourite sushi places in the city and for good reason..... their delicious combo of Japanese cuisine, their VERY CHEAP prices and their location in the heart of Toronto's trendy Yorkville area!  This small gem is a great place for all sushi lovers to visit because it is not expensive, it has fast service and has a menu that has long lists of Japanese foods to try.  And I have to say personally, this place serves up the best spicy tuna!  I was at Sushi Inn for dinner this past weekend with two of my girlfriends and I ordered my lovable spicy tuna, along with their dynamic roll (similar to the dynamite roll you find at other sushi houses) and plain but yummy salmon maki.  Other faves I must suggest at Sushi Inn:  - Seaweed Salad (Seasoned with sesame oil and it always green and crunchy)  - Nabeyaki Udon (A delicious and amazing noodle dish with veggies and seafood, perfect for people who are not into sushi but love other types of Japanese food)  - SUSHI .... my faves are this place are the spicy tuna or spicy salmon, unagi (BBQ eel) and their HUGE futo maki roll which would please any vegetarian's tastebuds   Overall, Sushi Inn is a great stop which is inexpensive and casual. The only thing I shall warn you about is that you will wait for a bit for a table at prime dinner hours on a weekend!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say the sushi here is the best, nor is there an extensive list of specialized rolls, but this place is open late and the fish is on par with other decent Sushi establishments in Toronto. Situated in Yorkville, it's not the best value, but it's not bad.  I've grabbed take-out twice in the last month, and it's good to know that the quality didn't dip the second time You never know and I hate it when I go back a second time only to be disappointed.  The service is friendly, and they are patient, especially when I'm indecisive 100% of the time. The first time, the eggplant in miso butter really stood out to me. The slices were meaty, and the sauce was rich and flavourful - you really wanted to drench each eggplant steak in that sauce!  I also got salmon sushi that was cut in large slices - no complaints there.  The second time I went, we got a full meal including Chirashi bowl, and a couple of rolls. The reason I couldn't make up my mind was because I'm always looking for something new that I have not tried - but here, you're just going to get straight up good sushi. Not going to lie - I was a bit disappointed in the assortment in my Chirashi bowl  - I expected ALL fish, not pieces of tamago and imitation crab as a part of the deal... just say'in, but that's just my opinion. The fish selection, overall, was very generic. It came with the standard salmon, tuna, octopus, and surf clam. Nothing out of the ordinary.  All in all, it was a solid meal with extras for the next day. I'll come back when I need a sushi fix, but with so many other places in the city, it's more of a late night option for me."}
{"text":"I was not planning on having sushi for lunch. But I was in the neighbourhood and I spotted this sushi restaurant. I decided to venture inside and try it.  It is one small & packed restaurant! The real estate (& I am referring to space, layout, construction & design) is at a premium here! Table seating is reserved to the right side with a small sushi bar (maybe 6 seats) to the left. Group seating can be found on the second row and next to last row. But most tables seem to be for 1or 2 persons. It is tight, so be prepared to potentially share a cozy meal with a neighbour. Because I arrived after the lunch rush, I had no neighbours.  I ordered from the lunch special and right away, I noticed prices are very affordable for Yorkville. Definitely will keep this restaurant in my mental notes for future visits. The menu is vast and with sufficient choice to merit a few more visits.  The service is prompt and friendly. I immediately had green tea and water and they were refilled quickly without me needing to request it. The food also arrived quickly and it was fresh.  I ordered the spicy tuna with sashimi (salmon & tuna). I enjoyed it and I also appreciated that it was satisfying without overfilling."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Yorkville.   This small restaurant serves up sushi and other Japanese dishes at prices you would never expect in this area of town. What makes this restaurant great is not only is it reasonable but the sushi is fresh and service is amazing. Marvin, I believe, is the manager and is one of the nicest most helpful person I've ever experienced at a restaurant. The clientele is also not your ordinary Yorkville clientele. Normal people go here! Unpretentious non-LA types.   The decor leaves something to be desired as it seems a little stale, especially for the area. Wooden tables and chairs and a paint scheme reminiscent of Japanese noodle houses.   Overall, I recommend this as the best place in Yorkville. The prices are more than reasonable and the location is great. You get great value for money here. Service is speedy and clientele is a great mix. Would have given it 5 stars but the decor is a little bland and they are due for a renovation."}
{"text":"While it's fine to approach this on a price:quality=value perspective, when quality is so near 0, the left side of the relationship becomes irrelevant.  The Mrs. and I went with the kiddies for some weekend lunch.  We were quickly seated and given our menus.  The kids had salmon teriyaki, the lady had a bento box, and I had \"gold\" sushi.   The food was about what I'd expect on a budget airline.   The syrupy teriyaki coated the very fishy-tasting, overcooked salmon; the rice in the gold sushi was dried out - why can't rice be done right on a budget; and the bento box was mediocre at best.     Any additional requests needed at least two asks - nothing was done at first try.   At the end, I felt a little bit like the kid whose dad was rushing him to the toilets just before he projectile vomited.   At least Sushi Inn didn't go back home with him."}
{"text":"Had the combo C (teriyaki salmon).It hit the spot. Served with rice, salad and miso soup. They gave me THREE good sized portions of salmon with more than enough teriyaki sauce. Nice staff, great value and pretty fast service!"}
{"text":"I ordered the hamachi and salmon sushi... which gave me the worst food poisoning I have ever had in my life. Ever. Also their prices on the takeout menu were different than what they charged me. Maybe prices went up. Approach with caution."}
{"text":"Average food, terrible service. Their prime Yorkville location keeps them busy and servers make zero effort to be pleasant, never ever smiling or asking if you need anything. If you do need something, you have to work hard to catch their attention or get up and go after them to ask for what you need. Last time my shrimp tempura roll was cold and when I complained I was told that some people prefer it that way in the summer since its too hot outside. Really? I don't think so! Fresh, hot and crispy is expected from any kind of tempura. I went again today (short memory unfortunately) and my friend and I had the same way below average experience, with no smiles or attention from anyone. This was my last time in this place."}
{"text":"Good prices, decent sushi. Fun place to go if you're shopping in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Average sushi joint in Yorkville. The sushi was fresh enough and affordable but there are definitely better options. The service felt a little rushed and I was kind of cramped in my seat next to the other table. I had the sushi / sashimi combo for about $16. Then salmon and tuna were good and the rice was warm - so that was positive. Not bad if you are in a pinch and don't want to drop much money."}
{"text":"Every single thing that is made at Sushi Inn is fantastic. Very fresh and beautifully prepared. I love it."}
{"text":"yea... it's just the corner sushi bar - decent and creative selection, but not much on the taste.  I got the Cold Noodles (soba) and the noodles were mushy.  Tempura was overly battered and fried"}
{"text":"We haven't been here in years but our last memories of it was good sushi at a decent price (especially for Yorkville). We were so disappointed, All You Can Eat is better than this. Complimentary salad was over-dressed, both the sushi and sashimi were not fresh and served too cold, and the maki had so much rice. We ordered the Sushi and Sashimi set B and the Hotate set. We could not finish either dishes between the two of us."}
{"text":"Great sushi for your money, always fresh, simple and tasty. As a regular sushi lover, I have to give a high mark to this place.   We come here for years and don't mind driving all the way from West End. Sometimes take us 30 minutes to get there, but that alone tells enough."}
{"text":"The only reason why this place is staying in business is because of their prices.  The atmosphere, service, and quality of food is terrible.  I would only eat there if you're starving and looking for a place to fill your stomach with very little cost."}
{"text":"OPEN LATE!  This place saved my starving arse one Sunday night. And not only did it save it, it satisfied it. Quickly. hahaha...  Great location in the middle of Yorkville with a decent amount of seating. Service is fast.I ordered some salmon sashimi and yakisoba w/ teriyaki chicken. See my pics. If you go to a japanese restaurant, the food's gotta have some artistry & I appreciate that this one does... even down to their wasabi rosette."}
{"text":"This restaurant was packed by 6:30 which is probably pretty normal for a restaurant situated on Cumberland street. I was greeted by the friendly manager ( he is actually so nice) and was seated immediately as it was just me. I got to sit in front of the sushi bar where the sushi chefs slice sashimi and construct the nigiri sushi.  Strangely this restaurant is run by Chinese people and there are also a surprising number of staff for a restaurant so small. Like seriously there are like 2 people at the register for less than 15 tables and there are probably 3 or 4 staff assigned to each third of the restaurant hence it gets pretty loud and there's a lot of traffic in the corridors due to the waiters Walking in and out. Most of them seem to be having quite a chill time.  Anyways after I was seated and I ordered I got a glass of cold water, this was really strange for a Japanese restaurant where I have become almost accustomed to receiving a cup of hot green tea. I had to actually ask for green tea to receive a cup and when I received my miso soup I didn't get a spoon either so I just drank it from the bowl.  My bento also came with 12 of these tiny maki sushi rolls they were alright and contained cucumber and salmon. The miso soup was actually really good not too salty with a generous amount of kelp and tofu and was really hot which was great.  Next came my bento which was the gold box, I had it with salmon teriyaki and like some other reviewers I agree that the salmon teriyaki is solid. Crisp on the outside but still moist on the inside and coated with a good amount of teriyaki sauce.   The salad came with a really creamy mayonnaise-like dressing which I wouldn't call unpleasant but I definitely prefer the sesame based sauces or the refreshing vinegary sauces that most Japanese restaurant serve their salad with  There was also tempura which featured a shrimp some eggplant and pumpkin as well as a strange tempura imitation crab stick. They were all pretty decent, the crab stick was weird. Easily the worst part of the meal were he 2 spring rolls. These are horrible, almost no filling and almost entirely just a small cylinder of the pastry. Couldn't bring myself to finish the second one despite each one being only the length of a finger.  Overall the food is pretty okay, though for the price of 15 dollars you could probably get better food. This restaurant is packed with servers but don't let that fool you you won't be getting shatteringly good service. The manager is nice though, he's efficient and works harder than all his workers which is a good sign."}
{"text":"This is my go-to take out place. I always get the Sushi Inn lunch special, with a substitution of California rolls (+$2). It comes with a soup, salad, a platter of tempura, dumplings, and sushi. The portions are fantastic, the flavour is great, and the service is attentive. I usually do take-out, and had asked for a delivery once (which was free, but don't forget to tip the guy!). As a student, this place is budget-friendly. Great place to get your sushi fix."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  I really enjoy going to Sushi Inn whenever I am in the Yorkville area.  Their prices are reasonable and their service is good.  They are constantly refilling tea cups and their food service is very quick.  I used to come here almost every week many years ago, but just recently went back a couple of times and the fish was not AS great as I remember it to be.  My favourite dish is the Salmon Sushi Pizza. I have yet to try another sushi pizza as good as this one!!  Their miso soup is never disappointing, and I love their green salad dressing and their spicy mayo. Yum! :)  I really do think that they should renovate some day though because the space is very small and the tables and walls are beginning to look old and run down.  I have been going to this place for approximately 8 years now. Not much has changed, including some of the staff."}
{"text":"During my vacation in Toronto last week, I saw this restaurant coming out of the Bay subway station and couldn't resist the temptation for sushi at the moment.  Therefore, I went here for lunch.  The sushi was above decent, and the prices were pretty good also (in comparison to my sushi experiences back home in the San Francisco area). For me, it's especially nice that for a sashimi combo plate they give you items such as the surf clam which I normally don't get.  The service is okay, it appears that it could be spotty depending on the server.  For example, they didn't refill my tea for a long time, but after one lady started doing so she came back quite frequently.  Overall, I'd say 3.5 stars based on this visit.  I will remember the place too if I return soon for a visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Though it's in the fancy area Yorkville, the price is perfectly reasonable and the food is just on point. Probably my favourite sushi place in town"}
{"text":"I was a bit nervous when we walked in because of the cafeteria style atmosphere but the service was very friendly and the sushi was very fresh and delicious. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Solid neighbourhood sushi spot! Got takeout on Friday, it was decent quality and good value. I tried the Gold Box (#67) which came with miso soup, salad, 6 pieces of sushi, tempura, spring roll, dumplings and chicken teriyaki for about $18. Yes, all of that! More than I could eat for sure. Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"This was a great family friendly find in a ritzy neighborhood. The food was delicious and definitely reasonably priced. The staff was friendly and we would absolutely return."}
{"text":"Don't be misled by the majority of reviews as this is not a five-star place, for anyone who has ever had real sushi in Tokyo or been in a true Japanese restaurant.  It's popular because it's fast, convenient and generally reliable.    Sushi Inn has been a staple in Yorkville for a looooog time.  It's always overstaffed, crowded and I've noticed that the richest, whitest, best-dressed people tend be seated right at its second-storey bay window by the entrance.  The space is a bit cramped for my liking, noisy and not a place to lounge around.  The atmosphere here is no different than a Hong Kong cafe, where everything is rushed.  Its giant army of Chinese waiters and waitresses - feel free to address them in Mandarin or Cantonese - are on their toes and at your beck and call.    The food itself is fairly consistent and the prices are a deal when you consider their porpotions ... just another piece of evidence to prove that this is actually a Chinese restaurant, NOT Japanese.  Although I came here long before I decided to give up animal products, the sushi never made a strong impression of me.  What I can speak about is that there are quite a few selections for the vegetarian, including lots of appetizers and a great bento set.  The seaweed salad isn't bad, although the miso soup is on the salty side (no surprise).  Two people can stuff themselves silly for only about $20-25.  Good, fast dining for a break in between shopping at Hazeltown Lanes."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this sushi place for their salad with their yummy dressing. My go to order is the soba noodles with chicken teriyaki. We came here the other night after a long time and the teriyaki was very salty and dry. Also their miso soup costs $2.25 when it cost about $1 or less everywhere else.   Wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if I was in the area I would."}
{"text":"No. Just no. This was just flat not good. I had chicken teriyaki and the BBQ chicken spring roll,  and was far from a fan of either. To top this off, the service was poor. The BBQ chicken was cold and flavorless, I had to put soy sauce on it just so I could swallow it. Then when the chicken teriyaki came out the bowl was scorching hot, it had obviously just come out of the microwave. At least they didn't let it sit I guess. To no big surprise, the chicken was terrible. I literally removed the chicken so I could eat the rice. I went home hungry this night.   Now I will admit, when you think sushi you typically do not think chicken teriyaki, but that is what I wanted and it is from the same region of the world. More than that, I expect some level of quality and not a microwaved bowl of yuck. Never again."}
{"text":"Ok, I feel a little better now.  Seeing that this place has a 3 on yelp reassured me that I am not crazy.    My best friend has been telling me about this place for years.  Every time she goes to Toronto it is her \"must do\" stop and she goes for the sushi pizza.   Let's break it down.  The guy  at the door wasn't so cool. The wait was 20 minutes (a tad too long for an early dinner) and only after we were about to leave did he decide to offer us the sushi bar.  Since my bff has been talking about this amazingness forever we opted for the sushi bar as that was seemingly the only opportunity to try this place.   I got a sushi plate with all different types of nigiri and 3 pieces of CA roll. Of course we ordered the sushi pizza with unagi as well.  The rice in my nigiri was warm! EW.  No one else's in my party had that problem so mine must have been made from a different batch.  When salmon or any other fish sits on top of hot/warm rice... well... it cooks! The nigiri was blah and I just ended up eating the hot fish and not eating the rice at all.   The sushi pizza was good but just not  my thing (hot again).    I should probably be giving this place 2 stars but I will give my friend the benefit of the doubt and assume this was an off-night.  Definitely will not be on my \"must do\" list when I visit Toronto next."}
{"text":"Average sushi, served quickly enough to feel like a fast food establishment with surly waiting staff and over-priced menu."}
{"text":"I personally love yorkville!!! My favourite place to dine and have a good time! The sushi, service and presentation is a 5!"}
{"text":"This place is alright for a quick bite in Yorkville. Not one of my favourite sushi places but definitely not one of the worst either. Their sushi can have way too much rice, and the service is not super friendly. Will probably come back one day, but only when there are no other options around."}
{"text":"I did not experience the poor service or food poisoning or the inability to communicate in English that others have written about.   The food is indeed cheap, cheap for Yorkville and, yes, subpar This is 'sushi' for people who feed their children a Big Mac and chicken nuggets as a 'treat' or book birthdays for the kids at Chuck E Cheese's and unleash themselves on their local Chinese buffet. Sushi Inn has as much to do with Japanese food as Domino's Pizza has to do with Italy. Rather, this is a place people go to have tasteless. something called, Sushi Pizza, an approximation of tempura and spicy roll this and spicy roll that... you know, all the fake stuff Chinese and Korean-Canadians deliver to people who don't know any better and don't care to...  With all that said, I was invited to meet friends here and had a miso soup, which was fine and a agetofu, which was blah... I did not taste anything else, but did not want to. People around me were happily placing orders for shrimp skewers and teriyaki this and that served by Chinese waiters who had picked it up from the Chinese cook who was also making spring rolls.   The prices are a definite bargain and especially so for the street and the tables are too close for comfort. They do have a good ratio of servers to tables however so the service is fast, they happily split the bill and they keep refilling the tea and water so no problems there either.  Whatever this place's secret is the 'inn' has been around for years and judging by the jam packed Friday night will be here for many more years."}
{"text":"Sushi is okay, kinda fresh, but just okay. Not the best sushi around. WORST service I've ever had though. We waited 10 minutes for someone to come to our table for water after we were seated. When someone finally came the waitress didn't even speak or respond to us, she just stood there with her pen and paper staring at us and then walked away. The man who brought us our bill was extremely rude and was aggressively throwing our plates together while gathering up the table. He also was slamming down the debit machine down and basically just everything around him this guy was pissed af for some reason and was being salty. Get out of here with that attitude. Never going back they're all petty there, DON'T go. Save yourself your good mood. Like you're not even an AYCE sushi joint so why is your service -609484/10. H.o.r.r.i.b.l.y. H.o.r.r.i.b.l.e. I hope they're reading this right now. If they are, hello, you guys suck and learn how to smile."}
{"text":"A casual must-do after a day at Toronto Reference Library. Dinner for 2 under $40-- in the middle of Yorkville!  Recommended:  Take (octopus) sushi Hotate (scallop) spicy handroll Enoki mushroom rolls Yellowtail & green onion roll Seaweed salad The mango jellies that come with the bill! (I was not too proud to grab some on the way out).  Gripes:   I had to ask for green tea refills too many times. They should really leave a pot on each table.   My hot food came before the cold food. The Enoki beef rolls had to be cleansed from the palate before enjoying the fresh tako.  Merely OK ginger and wasabi."}
{"text":"Do I live close to this resturant ? NO Do I always come to this resturant? YES This sushi place is FRESH, TASTY and has such original sushi rolls/dishes! It's always busy however the turnover is quite fast, I came here on Saturday evening around 830 and the wait was only 20 minutes. The staff are t overly friendly but they are attentive. I haven't tried their noodles dishes / soups but I've had a variety of their rolls, they're all tasty, not overly sauced and stuffed. My favorite  set is the scallop sushi roll set which comes with a hand roll,maki and nigiri. Some other rolls that standout are the rolls wrapped in cucumber and salmon (great for the people who are avoiding carbs). The reason for the 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because it is a little pricey however it's yorkville ... so it's expected."}
{"text":"Very generous portions for the price but the rice was warm and gummy, which pretty much ruins the sushi experience. Fast, friendly service doesn't make up for cafeteria-quality food."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite places for sushi in Toronto though I don't consider myself a connoisseur of any type. I've been here on several occasions as it is very close to my university.  The seating though cramped is cozy and was actually appreciated as I've been here on cold winter days only.  The service is fast, they get your bill speedily and the portions are great but that could be due to the fact I always, always, always get their bento boxes.  This place is always packed when I come and I can see why. The sushi isn't the best but it's palatable and average.  Very affordable for Yorkville and I am kicking myself for not knowing about this place until recently even though I lived in this area for quite a few years. The tables are clean and I honestly cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi and sashimi combo to go. For $14 dollars it actually came with a fairly large amount of food. The sashimi was extremely fresh. The decor inside isn't the prettiest (especially for yorkville standards) but hey reasonably priced fresh sushi, you can never go wrong with that."}
{"text":"This place is super DOOPER cute located at Cumberland. It's right across that big rock everyone sits on sad soon as they exit Bay station.   Anyway, my sister and I went on a day that rain so the atmosphere was pretty quiet. The place is good for large groups although the place in itself is quite small.   My sister and I ordered the octopus as a starter. It was really good and the sauce that came with it was worth it. I just wished it was a little crunchy rather than chewy.   We got a sashimi plate and a new rolls.  Everything tastes pretty fresh. Most definitely a place I can see myself going over and over."}
{"text":"Never going back, terrible experience.  Things wrong with this restaurant:  1) Service: I almost never complain about service, but sometimes it's just over the line.  We ordered an additional salad with our entrees not knowing that they had come with them.  Twenty seconds later, they brought us our free salads, and we tried to cancel our other salad.  \"It's too late, cannot cancel\", our waiter said, and briskly left our table.  2) Salad: the salad was horrible.  The lettuce chunks had lots of water on them (at least they were washed I guess?) and the sauce was thick and salty.  Not at all appetizing, and we couldn't even cancel the big one that we ordered by mistake (see #1)!  3) Sushi: fish aside (quality of the fish I can excuse, since they all taste the same at low prices), the rice was completely wrong.  The rice was cold and dry, and there was not a hint of vinegar in it.  Rice ball with fish on top does not equate to sushi.  4) Soba: the soba noodles looked light green instead of brown, and tasted like white Chinese noodles.  The soba tsuyu tasted like watered down soy sauce.  That was the worst \"Japanese\" food I ever had, I would be ashamed to even call it Japanese.  The AYCE sushi down the street is much better."}
{"text":"One of my fave sushi joints in the city. Cheap and cheerful but always quality. Plus, right in the heart of Yorkville and probably the best value restaurant in this area (IMHO).   VIBE It's always busy here unless you go before the dinner rush. They're quick on take-out too.   I EAT Their miso soup is one of my favourites in the city but it's a bit more expensive than most.   I always get the dragon B roll: shrimp tempura with salmon and avocado. Mmmmm!  Edamame portions are generous.  And gyoza = yum!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I'm always \"inn\" this sushi joint!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm reviewing on purely order-in experiences  For the area and the price it's really good!  My score is based on the quality for the cost.  The fish was fresh and delicious, and there's a large selection of foods. For only 10.50$ +tax you can get a pretty filling assortment of sushi rolls, salad, and soup. It's not going to blow your mind, but for the poor student who wants to treat themselves it hits the spot.  They're also pretty fast at delivering."}
{"text":"Not the most authentic Japanese cuisine but the location makes this place fairly busy.  More of a fast food style Japanese.  If you are in area, I would recommend looking at alternatives"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. No consideration, literally just slaps the menu in front of you."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Sushi Inn for years, and I still can't believe how reasonable the prices are for a place located in Yorkville! I was craving a bento box yesterday, so I stopped in for an early dinner. Unfortunately, I had just missed the lunch specials (lunch specials are available from 11:00am - 3:30pm every day. Yes, every day!) If you miss the lunch specials, the dinner menu costs a couple of extra dollars. I am a creature of habit, so I ordered a bento box. I just love to have a little bit of everything! My friend on the other hand likes to try new things, so he ordered a noodle dish.   Once again, I was not disappointed with the food. For under $13 I got a bento box with teriyaki chicken, tempura veggies and shrimp, six maki rolls, miso soup, rice, salad, spring rolls and dumplings. I also ordered a tea. I was pleased to learn that the noodle dish was a hit with my friend. In fact, I kept stealing pieces of veggies and dipping my rice in the noodle sauce - so good!   The only disappointing part of the meal was the inconsistent service. I had to keep asking for my water to be refilled, and only when we were close to finishing our meal was my tea refilled.   If you are looking for affordable & tasty food, good portions and efficient service in Yorkville, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Who needs to watch that show with Heidi what's-her-face on it when you can just catch the real thing at Sushi Inn? When receiving a last minute review over the phone, I was told to expect a \"Sushi on Bloor, but in Yorkville\". However, I didn't realize that that referred not only to the physical location, but the clientele as well.   Tried as I might, I could not shut out the yammering ons of the real life Gossip Girls (\"I know we're immature! We're only 17!!!\") at the neighbouring table. While the off handed talk of $100,000 RRSP contributions (I'm just jealous) and their most recent Girls Gone Wild escapades at Senor Frog's (Been there, done that. Not proud.) was off putting, it luckily didn't take away entirely from my first experience at Sushi Inn.  Besides the large staff on hand who were friendly and efficient, the first thing you are greeted with upon entering the restaurant is the deli style refrigerated display of vibrant seafood and other fillings at the sushi bar. This made me wish that we could really eat with our eyes, so that I wouldn't have needed to spend time looking through the big menu all the while holding back my salivation and shushing my tummy growls.  The prices were unbeatable in this part of town and the serving sizes were wonderfully large. I was disappointed with the \"cold tofu\" though, which arrived warm, accompanied with unappetizingly melty ice cubes, and missing the grated ginger. The sushi, as promised, was just like that of Sushi on Bloor. Sushi Inn is a great place to save on food (without sacrificing your stomach), so that you can spend on all that great shopping just around the corner."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am here at a minimum of twice a week (bad for my wallet, good for my tummy :P). I love the Dragon Rolls, sushi and sashimi. I am not a fan of bento boxes in general so I never get those.  I know it is not authentic but I love the quality and quantity. A must try if you are in Yorkville and I very highly recommend them."}
{"text":"My actual rating is 2.5.  Not impressed.   \"Seafood deluxe?\"  Man!  You're so vain.  I think it should be renamed \"Seafood mediocre.\"    And the service was lame today too.  Other people seated after us had their order taken first.  My partner asked for water... never got it.  The final turn off is being crammed into a table so close that I feel tempted to sample from my neighbour's plate.  Tried this place twice and I'm done with it."}
{"text":"Surprisingly affordable Japanese food in the heart of Yorkville.  Sushi Inn falls into that reliable category of Japanese restaurants for people who are scared of real Japanese food.   I'm sure they offer it; but it's likely lost amidst the california and cream cheese rolls; the serviceable tempura and standard smoky miso soup.   Sushi reviews are largely interchangeable, so I'll just point out that the fish is reasonably fresh, though chilled to the point that its flavour is blunted. Salad is wet but crispy, and everything runs a tad sweet.   It's still a good spot for a cheap date, or a welcome respite for the parents during a Holt Renfrew run."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for sushi, its clean, fast and the prices are acceptable. They have lunch deal trays that are filling and cheap in price. This place is always busy so the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and I think the place averages out to about 3 stars.  The last time I went it was very forgettable.  Food was way too salty.  Previous times before that were quite pleasant so I am willing to forgive and give it another shot.  It was very busy for a Monday night and I had to wait around.  After the meal I noticed that there was a similarly priced sushi joint that was dead empty just slightly west of this place.  Next time, I think I'll give that place a try and avoid the line-ups."}
{"text":"Of all the sushi places in the city, this is the one I come back to the most.  Is it the best sushi one can find? No.  Is it the prettiest?  No.  But something about this place is pure comfort.  It's consistent, reliable, plentiful, satisfying and inexpensive. Plus, you get the primo Yorkville location without the Yorkville prices or attitude.  This place is always busy, but they will always find a way to accommodate you."}
{"text":"One of the great things with this restaurant is that it's decently priced for the neighbourhood. I get the sushi inn lunch special that gives you a ton of food. It's not the best sushi in the area so don't go here expecting a culinary experience but it's ideal if you just need something good to eat that won't cost a lot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sushi Inn.  It has a great location in Yorkville, the food is great and the service is more efficient and friendlier than the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld.  Every time I'm home in Toronto, I make a point of stopping by to have their Dragon B and Chicken Age.  I would kill for a place like this in Palo Alto."}
{"text":"Sushi Inn is a great little cheap gem in the heart of Yorkville. I don't know how they pay their rent and keep prices down, but I guess they must make a lot of money since the place is generally pretty busy.  When you step in, you're always greeted and seated right away, staff are super friendly and everything is fast. There always seems to be someone around to help, even if they're not your server they're on it. They have great combo selections for good prices, their maki are tightly rolled (I hate a loose roll), and their noodle soups will keep you warm and happy.  I'd recommend going during the week, especially on a lunch break -- you'll be in and out really fast, and you'll have a belly full of delicious sushi."}
{"text":"It seems like I can't escape Yorkville. I've worked in this neighbourhood most of my adult life. Although I spend a lot of time cursing the overpriced restaurants and the rude snobs that strut by, I acknowledge that Yorkville has its redeeming qualities.  Sushi Inn is one of them. Located on Cumberland, this restaurant is surprisingly cheaper than expected, given its posh location. The interior is air conditioned in the summer and accomodating to large groups. During lunch, many coworkers come here for a bite so it might be hard to find seating.  I only order sashimi and it's delicious. I always get the Silver Sashimi Combo and a Raw Seaweed salad. The seaweed salad is served in a medium-sized bowl and the portion is bigger than most sushi restaurants I've been to.   My total for the combo and salad is about $30 with tip. Not bad for Yorkville!"}
{"text":"This is a place that you will either love or hate. For sushi novices looking for a cheap place for your basic sushi this is definitely your place, but if you are a sushi connoisseur looking for fresh, well prepared authentic Japanese cuisine than this place will disappoint.  The first sign that I was going to have a bad meal was their odd pricing on the menu. The entire sushi/sashimi menu had two price categories with some kinds of fish priced the same as some veggie sushi and cheaper kinds of fish priced the same as pricier seafood. So I question the freshness and source of the seafood.  The sushi rice wasn't properly seasoned and lacked any taste and didn't have that nice faint sweet and slightly vinegary scent to it, which I think is a major fail for any decent sushi restaurant.  For a restaurant that's run by Chinese rather than Japanese I wasn't very surprised.  Here are some of the items I had:  Amaebi (raw sweet shrimp) - when this was ordered the staff wasn't too sure if they had it or not, when it was served it was definitely not Amaebi. The shrimp was tiny, I mean very tiny, as in salad shrimp. It was thinner than the chopsticks I was eating it with and it wasn't really raw as it should be. It seems to be flash blanched for some reason. A proper Amaebi should be a plump extra large shrimp served raw with the head on and it should melt in your mouth. This shrimp was lacked any taste and was a joke given it was tiny and not even the right kind of shrimp.  Sushi Inn Roll - being their signature roll this was also bland and forgetful. It was supposed to be eel, avocado, salmon skin, cucumber and tobiko. I could see a tiny sliver of eel and maybe bits of salmon skin but it had no taste and the salmon skin had no crispness to it. Some pieces had cucumber, some didn't. It was very disappointing and could be confused with a California roll.  Uni - I was surprised to see this on their menu as many sushi don't have this regularly on their menu, and at $5.25 for a two piece sushi it seemed like a deal. It didn't taste that fresh which I think was probably made from frozen and lacked the explosion of briny sea flavours which I was expecting from a fresh sea urchin.  Hamachi maki - this was improperly prepared and the cuts of fish was minuscule. It was missing the finely chopped scallions that brings out the flavour.  Spicy Tuna maki - it wasn't spicy at all and each piece had a big dollop of mayo on it which did nothing but drown out the flavours.  Futo Maki - again tasteless. The pickled vegetables should have that nice sweet and sour flavour which this didn't have and there wasn't much texture to it. There should be a pleasant mix of crunch and softness, but it was bland and monotonous all the way through.  Saba sashimi - this seems to be only decent order I had, but there is really no much to it as it was just slices of mackerel. I'm glad this was reasonably fresh and the cut was decent.  California Roll - this was very mediocre, just like the ones you get from your supermarket.  I had a bunch or other rolls and sushi, but they were all too mediocre and unmemorable to describe. Yes this place is cheap, but I would rather be eating somewhere else which had properly prepared fresh food that taste good. If you want good sushi, stay away from this place. I will definitely not come back."}
{"text":"It's cheap for a yorkville restaurant but if you look at it differently, quality to price, i wasted my money. I should have gone to sushi run instead. I bought this gold plate thing, a hand roll, maki and sushi in a decent serving. I'm not sure how this place is \"busy\" and people are eating sushi. There's a comment here mentioning it's sub par and I couldnt agree more to it. I hope they improve"}
{"text":"Food is good. Love the Gindara here! But service is extremely poor. They never smile or talk to you. They even tried to take away your dishes without saying anything when you are still working on it!! Shocked. :("}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Very fresh, decently priced. Miso soup was great too! Service was horribly cold and careless. The way our servers would clear our tables was nearly aggressive and annoyed. When we sat, we were not approached for nearly 10 minutes and were without water. This isn't an all you can eat place, there is no excuse for this kind of service."}
{"text":"Fast service, delicious sushi. Servers are efficient, not really super friendly but we didn't really mind much. They also deliver. My favourite sushi place in the city."}
{"text":"Simply put, this is the best sushi spot in TO. In the heart of Yorkville, where you'd expect to pay top dollar for food, Sushi Inn remains an oasis for quality at an affordable price. Don't expect a feng shui interior with dimmed lights and Japanese blinds, I've  eaten at those spots too and the sushi doesn't compare. Try the Hotate Set or any one of their hand rolls, the spicy tuna hand roll is a personal fave."}
