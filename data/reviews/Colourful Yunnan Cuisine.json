{"text":"They are the same owners that used to run Yunnan Cross Bridge Noodles in Scarborough.  The menu has not changed and the food is just as good as the old-times.  The Yunnan Noodles has a strong chicken broth.  Really good flavour and little msg, if any at all.  The noodles are just right and the toppings are good.  Extra noodles are just 1.50 an additional portion, so if you have extra soup, do yourself a favour and get another bowl of noodles.  Don't waste that wonderful soup!  Also had the Stir Fried Rice Cakes.  It is a unique flavour; smoky, meaty, savoury.   Definitely will order again.  The texture of the rice cake is just right, chewy without being excessively so. Deep fried cheese is also a treat; yes, some parts of China do have cheese!  Finally, we also had the mushroom rice.  The combination of chilis and mushrooms were really well matched and with the rice to soak up all the flavours, a very good meal.  Finished with the corn pancakes.  Real corn is used here, so a mildly sweet and very fragrant of corn dessert is the result.   Definitely a must try location for those who have not been.  And for those missing the quality of Yunnan food that used to be in Scarborough, come here!  The Chicken is something I need to order the next time around..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today, with my hubby.  We were supposed to go elsewhere, but it was full, so we ended up here.  We got there at 12 noon and were the only patrons but afterwards the place started to fill up.  I wouldn't normally come here by myself because I can't read Chinese and can't speak mandarin. Sometimes the English translations don't say much about the food, so it's better to be able to ask.  My hubby asked about a certain dish and it was spicy but didn't say on the menu.  We ended up ordering the Special rice noodles and the chicken and mushroom rice noodles.  The special noodles arrive at your table all separate and they mix it up with the veg, meats, noodles and soup at your table.  The bowls of noodles were both a good size and the flavours were good.  The chicken soup broth was nicely flavoured.  They also have  stir fried dishes and cold appetizers.   The service was very good, everyone was very pleasant and welcoming.  I would love to come back and try their other foods.  The bowls of rice noodles were good and very reasonably priced at $7.99 / $6.99."}
{"text":"Went to this restauarant at lunch. With 2 people. Ordered the yunan style noodle that this restaurant is famous for. As well the waitress suggested thr lamb dish she said was very popular. Now i have to say first of all the service was nice. The owner and waitress clearly care about the restaurant. Which is why i am giving them 2 instead of 1 star. But the food at this restaurant is just not good. It is over salted in both dish and noodle soup. And on top the noodle soup was also bitter to taste. The food looks okay in appearance. But its hard to say how it went wrong in all aspects. Simply put there isnt much excuse to give cause its not good. I wouldnt recommend this restauarant unless they change chefs. As it is like a sodium explosion in the food he cooks."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and mushroom rice noodle and stew sliced pork.  Like the other review mentioned, the rice noodle is really salty. It is strongly recommended to order another item to neutralize the saltiness. Also, they seemed to mess up my order as I don't see any mushroom in my rice noodle. (There is a chicken rice noodle on the menu). The stew sliced pork is amazingly good. Because of that, I gave 3 stars instead of 2."}
{"text":"Colourful Yunnan Cuisine, newly opened in New Kennedy Centre serves similar menu as Yunnan Cross Bridge Rice Noodle in Scarborough. http://www.yelp.ca/biz/yunnan-cross-bridge-rice-noodle-scarborough  ???? ($6.99) Yunnan Cross Bridge Noodles is definitely a good value! I was full after eating that whole bowl and you can add additional noodles if you sharing that with someone or has a carb cravings! Still the same verdict as I love the soup and noodle but so so with the toppings!  ????? Pu-Er Tofu just have a touch of spiciness but quite savory at the same time. Great healthy snack!  I like how they now renamed themselves as Colourful Yunnan Cuisine ????? as the restaurant serves more than just Rice Noodle...."}
