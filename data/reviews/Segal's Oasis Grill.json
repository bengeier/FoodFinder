{"text":"Small delivery order was 50+ minutes late. Chicken sandwich was miserably cold, soaked in mayo, and the coleslaw was warm and the fries were steamed to mush."}
{"text":"They were fantastic! I was delayed in the airport and starving and they were so awesomely accommodating, and the food was sooo good (Shout out to shelly!) Keep being great!"}
{"text":"I visit Phoenix frequently on business, and have made two stops here, specifically for a kosher meal after a long day of travel and work. Tonight, on my second visit, I ordered what they laughingly call BBQ ribs. I specifically asked the server what kind of ribs are served (short ribs, long bones); I was told three long bones. What I got were three strips of short-rib flanken, smothered in an almost flavorless BBQ sauce. These were over-cooked and tough. When I queried the server, she just shrugged. In fact, her reply was \"I'm just a server.\" Very unprofessional. When I went to pay, I asked if there was a manager available, I was told no. When I discussed this with the cashier, she could care less. As an Observant Jew, I do my best to patronize kosher restaurants; I will not return here. These people could care less about what they serve and how it comes out. If you observe kosher practices, find someplace else and don't waste your money. If you don't, go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Impossible to communicate with anyone there.  Every time I called they could not find my order.  I was hung up on twice.  Their customer service is a joke.  I ordered one month ago and have still not received any invoice or order confirmation."}
{"text":"To say I've experienced better is a huge understatement, although I'm comparing it to the NYC metro area, not Arizona. Their roast beef sandwiches, cole slaw and their soups and salads are very good, and their chicken dishes are okay, but their corned beef and pastrami (the standard by which most people judge a kosher restaurant) are just plain awful. Both tasted like Supermarket deli pre-packaged Corned Beef and Pastrami ROUND. What is this, an Irish pub with a steam table?!? I don't expect homemade Corned Beef and Pastrami in Arizona, but real Jewish Corned Beef and Pastrami MUST be \"First Cut\" or FUHGEDABOUDITT!!  And these comments about corned beef and pastrami go triple for Chompies, the absolute worst and most overpriced sellers of FAKE Jewish Deli food in the valley. Rubbery corned beef and pastrami ROUND does not cut it!"}
{"text":"Great food, lots of it and very nice and helpful people.  Heather (I think that's her name) was great.  Her first week, working alone and every table was served quickly with a personal touch.  Smile on her face made the experience extra special.  Mushroom barley soup was delicious but a bit salty.  Orange beef was amazing and too much. I took some in a doggy bag.  When I come back to Phoenix,  I am coming back here again. Definitely!  One other thing... They are open for lunch.  The Yelp hours were wrong.  They open at 11am.  Call ahead to make sure."}
{"text":"An unassuming little place with excellent food that happens to be kosher. You walk in past the deli counter, following the wall of cold cases to enter a back room. The restaurant section has ample tables and a small bar.   I enjoyed the Uzbeki samsa with flaky pastry and beef and lamb filing lightly spiced. A glass of Barkan Cabernet Sauvignon went well with the hot pastrami on rye with kraut and Israeli salad side. The server substituted the Israeli salad for the fries at no charge. The salad was similar to Greek salad, minus cheese. I noted a nice wine selection and saw a decent selection of bottled beers, including a couple choices from Shiner.  I appreciated the attentive but unobtrusive service and noted one large and two small parties seeming to get the same good service."}
{"text":"We were able to get a great cut of brisket here, just over 3lbs which is just what we wanted.  It may look scarce when you walk in but most of the meat is kept in the back so just ask.  In addition to pastrami brisket you can get corned beef brisket, chicken, and assorted other deli meats.  They have have a grocer section where we were able to pick up challah rolls (mmm...challah french toast anyone?), matzo meal for latkes and my husband's favorite pickles- Ba Tampte.  There are also lots of other selections ranging from candy to cous cous to egg flakes and cereals.    They have a pizza place next door (which may have deli offerings as well...) called King Solomon's but Segals itself is just a pure butcher and grocer.  Having grown up with kosher pizza we opted to not grab a slice because to be honest, kosher pizza isn't all that good."}
{"text":"Beware.....If you have a coupon (buy one entr√©e get one free) from entertainment.com, they won't honor it.  I highly suspect bait and switch tactics....uses coupon to get you there and then tells you that they won't take it."}
{"text":"Don't let looks deceive you. You walk into a small kosher grocery, and in the back is hidden a small, casual restaurant. Their Chinese food is AMAZING! For vegetarians, the Volcano tofu is awesome! I also love a chicken dish with onions in a dark garlic sauce, but don't remember the name of the dish. The chicken meat used in the dishes is moist, tender, and non-fatty. I have been to many restaurants in China, and I like Segal's Chinese food better! :o) The prices are excellent considering the meat is kosher. Great restaurant for non-Jews to try as well; the food tastes better than other non-kosher Chinese restaurants in phoenix."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Ordered two battle burgers to go. The menu description states they come with pastrami on top. Ordered one 1/4 burger and the other a 1/2 pound burger. It was my mistake not checking my to go order, but when I got home both were the same size burger and neither had pastrami on them. Very disappointing. The wings weren't very good either."}
{"text":"I placed an online order at 4:41pm. I called to confirm and spoke with a nice lady who told me it would be about 20-25 minutes. So 1 hour later the food arrives. The driver must have dropped the food as the plastic bag was full of sauce that should have been on my food. I'm hungry so I ignore the terrible presentation as I do my best to clean up the boxes so I can eat. Finally clean everything and and I open my food.......they delivered the wrong dish to me. I ordered beef and broccoli and received chicken and mixed veggies. I gave 2 stars because they agreed to refund my credit card otherwise 1 star and never again"}
{"text":"Quandary - When reviewing a kosher place, do you rate it against other KOSHER places or just all other places you can eat?  I'm going to try to compare apples to apples here and give it 4 stars in comparison to other Kosher restaurants. If we were comparing it to all other places you could eat, deduct one star for ambiance.   We walked through a little grocery and butcher shop to the back where they have a little restaurant. The decor is typical slapped together kosher eating establishment. Random framed posters on the walls, wooden benches and Formica tables for booths, and the usual work desk in the middle where someone is doing paperwork.  Our waitress was an adorable Jewish girl with pretty blue eyes, a welcoming smile, and bushy and extremely expressive eyebrows. She took our order (matso ball soup, burger, fries, ice teas) and was back with soup so quickly it made our heads spin. The soup was good, with the small fragmented chicken fat on top (supposedly the sign of good chicken soup - the larger the droplets, the lower the quality? Don't know if this is true but it's what I've heard). The matso ball was tasty (though not as huge as the ones at Canter's in L.A.).  The burger was typical of a kosher place - they love their meat to be dry and crumbly. It was a hickory burger so came with bbq sauce, onion rings, and slaw on the burger! I gotta admit, they nailed the toppings. Also, the burger came on a egg challah roll. If I had my choice, I would eat all my hamburgers on this roll from here on out until eternity. So, five star burger with four star meat. The curly fries were the typical restaurant supply frozen variety. The kosher pickle was out of a jar. Shame on you, Mr Segal. This is a kosher place in the middle of Phoenix. You are not too busy to pickle your own cukes.  Bottom line - if you want Kosher in Phoenix, go here. Why? Cause it's the only game in town."}
{"text":"We have driven past this place countless times, and this time we opted to dine here just to give them a try.  The spoiler alert here is that we should have just kept on driving and never stopped.  There were only 5 tables that needed to be waited upon, and we figured that it should not have been too much to handle for the only waitress that they had working this particular evening.  NOT!  It was 12 minutes before she had come to our table. Another 5 minutes to give us a menu. And then another 10 minutes before she actually took our order.  Within those nearly 30 minutes, we had asked for drinks; which never came until the appetizer arrived. Why did we stay, you ask, if service was so atrocious?  Because my Beloved chose this evening's venue, and I really didn't want to make her feel bad. She was already kicking herself for having chosen this place, and I wasn't about to add to her dismay.  For appetizers, we ordered the Lamb Samsa. The crust was burnt, and the lamb wasn't prepared properly. It appears that even though the exterior crust was overdone, the lamb itself was undercooked.  We ordered a shared dinner, which is comprised of the Lamb, Chicken and Beef Kabob Skewers. Enough food to feed a pair of hungry diners. I am not sure what it was with the onions, but it looks like someone cut a whole onion and covered our meal with it.  I will say that the food was tasty enough.   The meats were well prepared and were quite delectable. But, the whole service and appetizer experience soured us to the place, that we couldn't wait to get out of there.   And that would be an hour and a half after we walked in the doors!"}
{"text":"This place is so horrible my boyfriend and I played \"would you rather....\" (with Segal's being the punch line) after we left.  We walked through the door there was no staff to be found... until about 3-4 minutes someone came out. We were seated. The place lacked ambience. Our waitress took our order and was unfamiliar with the menu options.  We both ordered entrees chicken Marsala and chicken schnitzel. On the menu it states the choice of soup or salad AND a side of either curly fries, straight fries, rice pilaf, baked potato, or vegetables. My boyfriend ordered rice pilaf as his side. I wanted to have a baked potato but the waitress encouraged me not to because the wait time would be 30-45 minutes, so I decided with \"straight\" fries. She didn't ask if I wanted soup or salad but I was okay without.   My boyfriend did however order the matzo soup. I never had matzo balls before but after I tasted his I wanted my own bowl of soup. I asked our waitress and she says \"okay, I can add that on\". When my bowl of soup came out the matzo balls were cold. I requested the waitress to warm it up. She brought it out and it was better.   Next our entrees came out and they looked decent. And then it wasn't. The rice pilaf was COLD, like it was just taken out of the refrigerator. I had curly fries on my plate not straight fries like I ordered. The wine sauce on my chicken was salty and overwhelmingly strong with wine. I just wanted to get up and leave but my boyfriend didn't want to be rude. He kindly asked if they could heat up the rice a bit more. The waitress was nice about it and it was exchanged.   I nibbled on my curly fries and glass of water until the check came. $35 FUCKING DOLLARS! Luckily, we had a gift certificate to take twenty off but still, at $7 per person I would have been happy as a clam to have gone to Chik Fil A instead.  In short, maybe the market side is okay to shop at but DO NOT go to the Oasis Grill. Not worth the time nor the money!"}
{"text":"Segal's a \"shande\" (a shame) to Judaism and also to good food. Please let me establish a little credibility: my family is out of Kiev and Eastern Poland. I write this just after Pesach, secular 2015. My family seders included Bubbee, 16 aunts and uncles and 30 cousins. Two of those uncles owned a live kosher poultry store in Philadelphia; as a child I helped out there. I have been to Segal's five times for lunch. Their hamburgers. kosher though they may be, are cardboard and cost $18.  When I was there, there were fewer diners than their were waitperons,  but the quality of service was unacceptable. The market front room features two glass-fronted cases that are not even lined in order. The trays are strewn sloppily with kosher meat that is outrageously overpriced. A small $20 chicken turns out to be tasteless. A tiny selection of kosher groceries is comparably overpriced. And, you know, the essence of kosher is clean. The last time I was there, I used the men's room. There was fecal matter and used toilet paper strewn all over the floor and walls. After an hour, not eating my hamburger, I went back to the men's room. It had received no attention.  Chompies delicatessen is only superficially Jewish; it's much more fancy East Valley. But please go there, not here. Thank you. Baruch Ha'Shem."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's always been subpar. It took 15 minutes after we sat down for someone just to bring us menus.  I ordered a burger and fries. My burger came out burnt to a crisp. It was so dry and flavorless. The fries were good but cold. My husband ordered chicken fried rice which was actually not bad. It took about 45 minutes for these 2 things to come out. My mom didn't have anything to eat but ordered a hot tea. After we got our food but her tea wasn't out, she asked our server if her tea would be coming out soon... the server rolled her eyes and walked away without saying anything. Overall just a bad experience today."}
{"text":"OMG the food tonight was so enjoyable. Everything tasted fresh,  so fresh that the onions on my plate made my eyes water.  I ordered the Lula kabob, beef kabob and a side of fried rice -I am so Stuffed."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! Can't get kosher like this outside New York. All the meats are cut in house. They even roast their own roast beef. People complain of the prices but they clearly know nothing about the non-kosher competition. These other places charge more for a steak or BBQ ribs. The portions here are more than generous and you're guaranteed to see one of the owners because it's a family owned restaurant. The service used to be dicey but they have a great and friendly front of house crew and the solid back of the house crew makes it happen too. Don't let the location or bare bones marketplace deceive you: this place is a gem. American, Deli, Chinese, Uzbeki (trust me it's out of this world and Actually by a man from Uzbekistan!)  It's no surprise that when I'm in NY or NJ or FL that people have heard of Segals and also love it too! Skip Chompies and the other deli imitators...a real deli is a kosher deli and that's segals. Never had kosher Chinese, it's time to try it. Don't even KNOW what Uzbeki food is let alone WHERE Uzbekistan is? Think the tastiest lamb chicken and beef kebabs cooked al fresco over hot coals.  Looking forward to hearing your reviews!"}
{"text":"What is important about this place is that it services a very particular client very well.  The decor isn't so hot and neither is the product selection, but they do offer what they do.  If you are looking for a kosher butcher, here is one.  If you are looking for products from Israel, here they are.  The magic of this place is the restaurant they have attached.  Chinese food and deli in the same place!  What?!?!"}
{"text":"Very nice place with a Kosher food at the restaurant and a Kosher grocery store. I've ordered the chicken shnitzel and it was awesome! Very crunchy and and well cooked on the outside and very good in the inside. I've selected the white rise on the side and it was good too. the food  tastes like an traditional jewish food from my home country ISRAEL. It was a pleasure for me and my brother the get a dinner over there. We will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"CALL BEFORE GOING! The hours stated 9 am to 830 pm but when we showed up at 1030 it was empty and the owner came out of the kitchen stating the chef was not there and they did not know when the chef would come maybe in one hour or two if we wanted to wait.  We left hungry and did appointed"}
{"text":"Their hickory burger has the best patty I have EVER eaten."}
{"text":"Service was good, even though we were the only people in here. The young lady was very sweet and attentive. Our cups never reached the halfway mark and I love that!  The food... I'm still in shock. How is it possible that the best orange chicken I have ever eaten, is at a kosher restaurant?! The hummus is delicious as well as the onion rings we ordered. I can't complain about the portions either. I'm 245 pounds of sexy and I still couldn't finish all my food!   We have found ourselves another gem and we WILL be returning again. Thank you!    PS: I ate my food too fast to take a pic."}
{"text":"Delicious. I got take out and the place is so homey inside! They have the strangest variety of food and it's AWESOME. I got fried rice and an egg roll which were excellent. Huge portions. I also got the hummus plate and that was very tasty as well. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the roast beef sandwich on Jewish rye and it was very good, but a little on the salty side. It came with curly fries and homemade coleslaw, (those were VERY good), plus a yummy pickle spear. The sandwich was HUGE! I had the leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Ok, I have been meaning to go here forever.  As a Jewish Girl, I like to know where to get Kosher stuff.  I really did not know what to expect when arriving.  The store was smaller then I had expected, but carried a full line of items.  The meat case is where I hung out at most.  I decided to not get any meat here, as I was more just kind of getting an idea of what they carried more then anything else.  They also have a resturant here, but it was being revamped, so it wasnt really open.  I was kind of dissapointed, but its only temporary.  The staff here is small, but personable and will answer your questions if you should have any.  Please do not be intimidated when shopping here-its not just for us Jewish folks!! Its for everyone!  I would return here in the future, but probably not on a regular weekly basis.  They have Challah, which I love, and one or two other things that I like to have around the house that are hard to find elsewhere around the Valley here at times.  You should also know that due to the Sabbath, the close early on Fridays, and are closed all day Saturday.  They are open Sundays though!!"}
{"text":"I have been passing this place for the last 2.5 years as it is literally across the street from my work. A little jaywalking, and BOOM! You are there.   It was a gloomy semi-rainy day, so it was a perfect day for soup. My coworkers and I agreed to try this place and were excited that it was kosher (not that it made a difference, but we wanted to try something new) and that they served Chinese, Japanese, American, and Jewish in one place.  Two of got the Matzah Ball chicken soup, One got the wonton soup, and another one got the spicy chicken sandwich.   20 minutes later, I walked over to pick it up. The restaurant has a section that is \"bakery\" and butcher shop, and a grocery store for kosher items. The restaurant area is decent, nothing special. There was about 3 tables occupied, maybe 4 people total dining. I asked the waitress to split the bill by item since all 4 things were for 4 different people. She looked stressed. She was running around like a headless chicken serving FOUR people. Jeez, get it together. To be fair, it was her 3rd day. She asked some guy to help her split the check, he came over aaaanddd taaaaalllkkkeeddd liiiikkkeee thiiiiisssss (come on, spit it out!!) who seemed annoyed. What seemed like a 5 hour transaction was FINALLY done!   Food time! My Matzah ball soup was overwhelmingly underwhelming. It was bland, salty, and overpriced. One of my coworkers said her wonton soup was just \"eh\" and the other one said what I said and the one who ordered the $13 chicken sandwich said that he tasted lots of char. Super disappointing for the hassle I went through.  Overall, everyone who worked here was slow and unprofessional even the owner. The food is extremely overpriced and bland. I will not be going back and I recommend you don't either. SAVE THYSELF!"}
{"text":"Only reason why I gave it 2 stars is BC I liked their coleslaw and pickles. Boyfriend and I got the teriyaki chicken wrap and burger. \"Teriyaki\" was loaded with canned pineapple and a super liquidy  sauced that soaked the wrap and made it soggy. Also strange that it was covered in black sesame seeds. Burger was nothing special, tasted like something I could get at McDonalds. For a place that claims to be very particular about their food they didn't care much about  flavor or presentation. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Made an order for delivery and they guy that placed the order stated he couldn't give me the total and then when delivered it they charged me $10 for delivery. $30 for food for a teriyaki bowl. I CAN SEE WHY HE WAS HIDING MY TOTAL FROM ME and then the manager was so rude and acted as if I was lying!!! I'm completely insulted. It's not about the price it's about the business that was given. Completely shady and rude!!! And the food was soggy with a strong stinch. Embarrassing to order in an office. I would've given NO stars if there was an option. COMPLETELY OVER PRICED FOR THE QUALITY OF FOOD FOR AND SERVICE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A nice lean pastrami on rye, with great seasoned curly fries and basic side salad. When they first brought out the pastrami, it wasn't lean, but after I pointed it out, the waiter immediately took it back and they got it right. Very attentive service. All in all a solid performance at a good price."}
{"text":"Pastrami tasted good, but had a lot of tough tissue, and was near impossible to bite through. Rye bread was low-quality.  Curly fries were tasty.  Cole slaw was yummy! Really the highlight of the meal.  Lemon bar was delicious, if a bit subdued. (I like the lemon to pucker my face)  The brownie was warm and chocolatey, but too many nuts.  Probably my only visit, unless someone invites me."}
{"text":"This week the Jolly Diners returned to Segal's Oasis Grill, all kosher restaurant; which has excellent food. We began with veggie rolls, onion rings, and crispy tofu. Our entrees were various types of Lo Mein; everything from chicken to veggie. My order was veggie Lo Mein with added crispy tofu. it was all very very delicious and again just like my previous review, I will be back again to enjoy a meal here. This restaurant is for a family to enjoy a good meal at a great price. It is not fancy or in any way trendy, but service is good and the food delicious. The Jolly Diners rated Segal's Oasis Grill at a 5 out of 5 stars.."}
{"text":"Restaurant could use a remodel. Our waitress, Joni, was very nice and efficient. My fianc√© and her mom started with hot and sour soup and said it's the best they had. The beef potstickers were very good. Soft and the meat was tender and seasoned well. We also shared schnitzel which is deep fried chicken. It was good.   I ordered the orange beef with lo mein and it was great. Lo mein was awesome. My fianc√© loved it too. My fianc√© ordered beef lo mein and I had some. It was awesome. My fianc√©'s mom ordered beef and mushrooms with fried rice and shared with us. Beef was tender and mushrooms were seasoned well. The fried rice was over cooked.   We ended our meal with parve cupcakes. They were pretty good. We will definitely come back because my fianc√© and her mom love Kosher food."}
{"text":"Arrived at 7pm, handed a menu at 7:10, asked for ice tea and denied at 7:15, asked for hot tea and soup, asked for hot tea again at 7:20, given lukewarm tea at 7:25, Left at 7:45 never being served the soup. Terrible service. I watched multiple diners complain about their food. Completely surprised this place is still viable. Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst kosher restaurant in Phoenix. They have no respect for their customers and treat people like garbage. It's amazing this place is still open. There are so many better kosher options available. Dont even step foot in this place. You'll regret it."}
{"text":"Although the food has lots of flavor...there are usually errors. Food comes cold and under cooked. But the timing is pretty good and they have tons of delicious options."}
{"text":"Meh. Corned beef sandwich was decent, tuna was pretty good. Matzo Ball soup.. Mushy and Flavorless. Service was VERY slow and not very welcoming.  Very sad because I wanted this to be great."}
{"text":"First time here. If you're looking for reasonable kosher priced dinner this is the place to go. we started off with soups which were delicious. Had the beef pot stickers surprisingly very good. Also  ordered a pesto chicken pasta, teriyaki salmon came with a delicious baked potato and the hubby ordered a schnitzel. All were good.  , best part was the service, Leah she was fast efficient and friendly. If you go there make sure you ask for her."}
