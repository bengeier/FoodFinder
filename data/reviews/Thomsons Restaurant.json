{"text":"If it's the weekend, and it's between 10:30am and 1:00pm, and you want to gorge yourself on everything from shrimp cocktail to eggs benedict, then head down to Thomsons Restaurant on Stephen Ave. They do indeed offer quite a spread in their classy yet comfortable restaurant.  Besides the shrimp cocktail and eggs benedict, which I overindulged in, they also have both omelette and carving stations. It's a little on the high side pricewise ($28 per adult), but I ate enough for the day, so if you cost that out over 3 meals, that's not too bad!  What to say about the service? Well, I got the distinct impression that my server had had a rough night, as evidenced by his shaky hands and somewhat bleary eyes. Nevertheless, I was never left wanting for coffee warm-ups, and my plates never accumulated in front of me.  All in all, it was a damned fine feed."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a company Christmas party and it was average. There were a number of appetizers to share with the table which were very good. We had parmesan truffle fries, calamari, bread.  For appetizers with our meal we could choose between butternut squash soup or salad. I got the soup. It was very good. Really tasty. The portion was huge though. It must have been about 2 1/2 cups. Really generous for an appetizer. Those that ordered the salad, a meal sized salad I swear, could not even come close to finishing it. The salad was really beautifully plated and really good.  There was a choice of salmon, chicken, and steak for the entree. I had the salmon, which was undercooked, but I ate it around the middle. Better than overcooked and I was so full from the soup I knew I wouldn't be able to finish my entree. The salmon came with a positively enormous amount of wilted flavorless spinach and at least 10, maybe 15 stalks of flavorless, but perfectly cooked, asparagus. I could not finish all the greens. It was way too much. Others had the chicken and the steak and out of more than 20 people barely anyone could finish their meal. The steak also came with a massive amount of asparagus and green beans, which are so similar it was kind of an odd pairing. More vegetable variety would have been nice.  The dessert choices were a butter tart (no raisins and very sweet and rich), a creme brulé with a piece of chocolate bark with rice crispies on it (the rice crispies did not add to the chocolate at all but the brulé was very good, a chocolate cake (the person that ordered this said it was quite good), and an eggnog cheesecake.  All in all service was good, the room if nice, my meal was ok. I don't understand why the portions are so huge. If I came back if go with someone and make sure we ordered one thing and split it. This place would be great if you had an enormous appetite."}
{"text":"A good, uncrowded spot for brunch.  Went here on Saturday after realizing 15 minutes in that we'd be in line for another 45 minutes at Over Easy Breakfast.  Thompson's has the typical sausage, bacon, hash browns, omelette station, fruit, granola, yoghurt, and pastries, plus somewhat fancier items like tomatoes gratine, frittata, and smoked salmon. Not a huge selection, BUT you can order waffles and Eggs Benedict a la carte and it's included, which is great because these do not survive chaffing dishes very well.  Also, coffee and juice are included in the reasonable $22 price tag, along with parking validation for the hotel's underground lot.  Note that the Sunday brunch is more expansive and $30. The apple juice is actually apple cider, which is a great touch.  The service was excellent and the atmosphere is refined yet casual at the same time.  You could bring guests here, maybe not for a special occasion, but for a good weekend breakfast without the wait."}
{"text":"Wanted a nice Sunday brunch with the family. Could not have picked a better spot. The carved beef was tender. Eggs Benedict and waffles on demand, outstanding. Service was fantastic and bordering on over attentive. Underground parking that is validated for diners. Can't wait to go back. Did I mention great charcuterie station and dessert table. I should have."}
{"text":"I consider this restaurant to be one of Calgary's best kept secrets.  In the half dozen times we've eaten at Thomsons, we have always been impressed with the food and service.  It's almost never busy and even when it is busy, the restaurant is so large, that you can still hear your table guests talk.  We park in the  Hyatt's underground parkade, and Thompsons waives the $25 parking fee."}
{"text":"My partner and I decided to stay in Calgary over Xmas so we went to Thomsons for their Christmas dinner. We heard that they had an amazing Christmas buffet!   It was my first experience at Thomsons and I was very disappointed. I had one slice of turkey (which was cooked perfectly was so good!) but when I went for seconds they had actually run out of turkey and instead a turkey roll which was obviously highly processed and terribly disappointing. The stuffing they served was mediocre at best. Their gingerbread creme brulee was one of the items I had for desert which tasted OK but it was only cooked on top! The rest was liquid. It was clearly not cooked long enough.   On a positive note, they had a vast range of food to choose from (e.g., traditional Christmas entrees as well as a variety of seafood, etc) and was beautifully presented. The restaurant has a beautiful ambiance.   The worst part of my experience was the customer service. I cannot recall another time that I've had such blatantly dismissive customer service from a waiter. Our waiter was responsive to the couple sitting next to us (e.g., walking over to ask them how everything was, providing refills on their water, offering them coffee with their deserts). Other than initially coming over to us when we were seated to provide us drink menus and take our order for wine (and removing our plates when we went up for second helpings and desert) our waiter consistently avoided eye contact with us.  We could not understand why we were ignored the whole evening when our waiter was clearly responsive to other guests in our section. We were dressed appropriately, we were not rude, we were not drunk, we did not behave inappropriately. We were not out of his view. We have no idea what it was the caused us to be so ignored.   Given this experience, I can't imagine attending Thomson's again."}
{"text":"Before our annual conference, my team always gathers here for breakfast. It's actually the only time I look forward to dragging myself outta bed in the wee morning hours to make it for our 7AM breakfast.  This year I don't know why the buffet was off. The bacon was overly crispy and disintegrated when you bit into it - and I was pretty disappointed because I piled my plate full of bacon . . . I ended up hiding it under a napkin while I went up to grab a few pieces of sausage (which were tasty), some fruit and cereal.   A few of my coworkers got the made to order omelettes and had great things to say about them.  I know we'll be back next year, I just hope the bacon will be better!"}
{"text":"As part of our package at the Hyatt, we had complimentary breakfasts at Thomsons.  On Saturday it was just a regular breakfast buffet with eggs, sausage, fruit, breads, sweets and an onsite cook for omelettes.  Orange Juice is free, not like everywhere else where it's extra.  On Sunday it was the brunch special with an added server cutting meats and had extra grilled veggie, cold cuts and some extra sweets. MY GOD!  Was this ever awesome.  The wait staff was excellent too.  Can't forget to give them kudos.  If you're not staying at the hotel, I would still recommend the Sunday brunch.  It was just that damn good."}
{"text":"Thomsons is the main breakfast/brunch buffet inside the Hyatt Calgary, and its one of the better ones I've tried.  It is spacious, has a cool Western decor, and has a number of good items not common in hotel brunch buffets I've been to. Its on the pricey side at upwards of 30 CAD/pp though.  My faves:  Pesto skin-on-salmon: Pleasantly shocked that fish on a buffet line can be so soft, juicy, and well seasoned.  Roasted Veggies: Good variety here, including white asparagus.  Roast Beef: Never too early to have this!  Well seasoned, tender, and so good with horseradish.  Corn Quinoa Risotto: Very good.  Calgary is famous for their beef and corn.  This dish is a healthier version of the Italian version and had a nice, pleasant sweetness from the corn.  I didn't like the yogurt parfait too much - yogurt was on the tart side despite the excellent toppings. Their dessert section was pretty impressive.  In honor of Calgary Pride Celebration they had a nice rainbow Panna Cotta that was smooth and sweet."}
{"text":"This place never fails to impress. The staff are incredibly customer focused and do their best every single time to make you feel welcome. I had the avocado toast - toasted Russian rye, poached eggs, house made guac and mixed greens - delicious. I have only been here for breakfast. The house Benedict is crazy: pulled juicy Alberta beef on a buttermilk biscuit with hollandaise and poached egg with bow island baked beans. Decadent!!!  Ivan served us today and he was awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here for the Sunday brunch , love the food there and the service great , it's a good place for family and friends hanging out also."}
{"text":"I loved Thompson's on my trip to Calgary.  Very upscale, amazing selection of steaks and pretty good and patient service. We were a very large and loud group and everyone got their orders perfectly right.  I had the steak bites as an app, delicious as well as a 12oz Ribeye.  Truly awesome, but some people got even better looking cuts than mine.  Overall, a fine experience. They offer breakfast and lunch and are connected to the Hyatt"}
{"text":"Came for brunch a couple weeks ago. It was not bad, but it took them forever to get more croissant's, and we kept asking and asking, and it took them almost an hour. At times they were out of bacon too. They ran out of a lot of things actually. The foods itself wasn't bad, but I really didn't like the Eggs Benedict. And a lot of the food was cold. What I really liked were the pancakes and the french toast. Doubt I'll be back. Much better can be had for the price. At least they validate parking."}
{"text":"We've been going to Thomsons for brunch and have always had a great experience.  Friends from out of town were coming in for the Folk Festival and we wanted to get together for our favorite brunch.  I looked at the Hyatt website and double-checked the hours... we were good to go.  We arrive and find that the restaurant and lounge are closed until September.  They did offer a make-shift, scaled down brunch in the hallway on the second floor but definitely not even close to the normal experience.  And then, to make things worse, we watched staff bring in a box of Cinnabons and dump them onto a tray.  Way to kill the illusion of a Thomsons brunch!  Unbelievable that they couldn't put something on their website notifying the general public of the closure.  I sent an email to the hotel and a manager responded that they have taken steps to inform their guests (?) and that they pride themselves in providing excellent customer service. (?!)   Ummm, I beg to differ.  We WILL NOT be going back... ever!"}
{"text":"We came down here for breakfast two of two morning we stayed at the Hyatt.  They have a breakfast buffet which I had one day.    The buffet is not huge but enough.  There are breads, pastries, cereals, yogurt, shots of shakes, oatmeal, potatoes, fruit and egg station.  You can also order bennedicts, waffles, pancakes and waffles.  I had the pancakes which were super light and fluffy. Almost too light, they broke apart super easily.  I had waffle too but enjoyed pancakes more.    The next day I ordered oatmeal.  It comes with brown sugar and raisins.  I asked for banana and it was an extra $3.  bummer  overall breakfast was good."}
{"text":"Having not dined at Thomsons in just over a year, I had high hopes for our dinner this evening. Previous experiences were decent and with the current state of the Calgary economy, I had expected restaurants of this calibre to have stepped up their game to provide the best possible service.   Sadly, not only was I disappointed, but I was in awe as to how this train-wreck of a dining experience unfolded and continued to get worse at every turn.   Right from the start, Nick, our waiter rubbed me the wrong way as he reacted and looked at me dismissively, almost with contempt, that I would order something other than an alcoholic beverage.   From ignoring me when I informed him of my allergies and then subsequently screwing up my order to getting annoyed at me when I let him know that the order was wrong, things just got worse as our dining experience unfolded. The kitchen overcooked my guest's steak and Nick informed him that it would take at least a half hour to get a new one. My guest simply told him to take it away as we did not have the time to wait that long for a replacement. Nick assured us that it would be taken off the bill.   Finally, when the bill arrived, sure enough, the steak was not removed. When I flagged Nick down to tell him, he again seemed annoyed that I would bring this to his attention.   Throughout these multiple mishaps, no effort was made by the manager to check in with us or apologize for the multiple mixups we encountered.   Overall, one of our worst dining experiences in recent memory and would definitely not recommend Thompson's for the mediocre quality food and substandard service. There are much better restaurants for you to spend your hard earned money at that deserve your business in this economic downturn."}
{"text":"Went here for a breakfast buffet. I was looking for a gluten free bread but couldn't find it on their tray, I asked them and the restaurant manager delivered on our table a fresh bread. I can tell it was fresh because I'm a gluten free bread eater. Very great customer service!"}
{"text":"I ordered room service and stopped in for breakfast once. Both times I found the food mediocre and way overpriced. Decent service from the delivery person and the server at my breakfast table. I decided on the breakfast buffet at the servers suggestion, and found all the food to be of poor to okay quality.  This building used to be bank, which is cool Calgary re-purposes old buildings."}
{"text":"I spent a week here a couple of months back. Every morning I would have breakfast here at the restaurant. They have a full buffet, including omelet station, or order off the specials or standard menu.   All the food is quite delicious. It's a matter of what you are looking for in terms of your meal. I would say however that there are some really good servers who are very attentive to your needs and others who just leave you there. Depending on which person you end up with will greatly change your perception of this restaurant. My only thing with this place is the fact that the potatoes always seem to be in that slimy too wet stage and not \"crisped\" up enough for me. I like to have my potatoes more firm than what is typically served but I think that is just my personal preference more than anything.  Lastly, the coffee. I guess that I must be a coffee snob and maybe so, however the furniture varnish/jet fuel they call coffee leaves a lot to be desired for me. Typically I can handle my coffee straight up, but not here. I need not only sugar (too much) but cream as well to help offset the inevitatble stomach destruction."}
{"text":"I told the waitress how delicious my dinner was (which it was!) and five minutes later the head chef came out to visit for a while. The waitress said later he is well loved and it is a tight team. The leadership shows in every detail of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times but only for the breakfast and brunch buffets on the weekends. Its always been consistent in the quality and variety of the items.  On the breakfast side of things there are fresh eggs Benedict, waffles, and pancakes made to order and brought to your table. There is an omelet station, traditional pans of bacon, sausage, eggs, French toast and hash browns. Also is salmon and cream cheese, bagels & toast, yogurt and granola, fruit, fresh juice and smoothie shots, cereals and pastries.  I'm not a fan of their coffee (fix the coffee, it's bitter!) but the orange juice is good.   On the brunch buffet is a carving station, mashed potatoes & gravy, soups, buns & rolls,  cold salads, pastas, charcuterie items, pickles & olives, and a dessert bar with custards, pastries, and a candy bar.  The service is amazing. Ringo is the best server I've ever had in any establishment. Ask to be sat in his section, you will thank me for it later."}
{"text":"Lunch time on a warm sunny day by the window. This worked out well for a lunch client meeting and the service and food were good. I had the lamb burger - interesting flavours with mint yoghurt smoothed on the bottom of the bun. The soup, sandwich and salad was ordered by the other diner and presentation was neat with all three lined up on a long plate. Desert looked fine - creme brulee....mmmmm!  Server was chatty while guest showed up which was nice as some servers can be void of that personal touch - you can always tell the professional servers that work to pay the bills.  I recommend this spot for lunch based on food and service alone. One note though is that the housekeeping could be a little better on the floor cleanliness and base boards - some little dust bunnies...minor point."}
{"text":"Excellent place. I came here for dinner with a gift certificate. We had the calamari, brie platter, and the venison. The calamari was the best Western-style (red onions and creamy sauce) calamari I have had. The brie platter had awesome fig jam and the brie was creamy and rich. My venison had a really complex blueberry gravy and was extremely tender. For dessert we tried the chocolate cake and ice cream. It was extremely rich and tasty. The waitress was friendly, relatively casual, and very attentive. A supervisor came by twice to ask us how we were doing and the manager came by once. Overall, an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Service is good. I just wish I had order something else. I would come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Flash back, one year ago:  I ordered french toast and it not only tasted like a fish fry, but it had a big ol' hair in it!  The manager was so nice- but really how do you come back from that?  Well, Thomsons HAS and I must rewrite my review because they have redecorated (Cowboy chic sepia and stone), upgraded the menu (STEAK BITES!!!), revamped breakfast, and have amazing customer service (Ask for Ringo!)  I have the \"opportunity\" to stay in this hotel often and test driven Thompsons  for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  My favorites:  STEAK BITES!!! A little steak, served sizzling fajita style in a cast iron pan, with onions, peppers, and cherry tomatoes - YUM!  Eat with a green salad!  Also-  the bread basket is actually special.  This is one time to not turn down the bread.  Enjoy!  Tell Ringo I sent you!"}
{"text":"My family love to celebrate birthdays or special celebrations at the Sunday brunch here ! The food is hot and tasty and there are beautiful desserts to indulge in.  I enjoy the selection of brunch food they serve and especially the eggs bennies and the fresh orange juice at the table.   They even have a candy bar for those who are never too old to cater to your sweet tooth candy cravings. Lovely setting and a really nice dining place to enjoy with our family .  Our adult kids really enjoy coming here with us."}
{"text":"Good for a hotel linked restaurant although lacks flair and style. Spacious though so would a nice place when you dont want to be jammed. Has decent brunch on weekends and lunch options decent. Wouldnt rush there but honest enough."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch at Thomsons. The Steak and Blue Salad. And yes, while it wasnt bad - it also wasnt that great either yet the pricing and reputation it has, suggested otherwise.   Locals claim this is 'Excellent'.  Cold steak, rather tough. Second class blue cheese and rather limp, tired greens - it should not be too hard to make a great steak salad in a city 'apparently' known for its great steakhouses in a place with large photos of steers and cowboys on the walls...  Then again, after a few visits to Calgary, I am finding that symptomatic of most if not all of the citys restaurants. They are not that good when compared to anything outside of Calgary.   Even so called 'higher end' places with meals made from their preferred staple - red meat - at the varied likes of Luxe Burger, Vintages, Saltlik and Thomsons - all considered 'great' by the Calgary locals but honestly, just not that good at all. In fact, if they were located in an LA, Toronto, Dallas or quite frankly any other large city but for a booming oil town that is just teaming with new money - they would be found struggling.    So for the locals to Calgary - go - you will love it at Thomsons. For those who hail from a good or even decent food city........  Meh."}
{"text":"The salad and the desert was so-so. but the lamb chop was great. The mesh potato was mixed with veggy and baked to perfection. the red wine sauce was good. for $35 big taste menus, it's not bad. way better than other \"trendy\" \"high end\" burger place who give a burger and lots of fries for $35. or modern italians food that has almost no cheese in it."}
{"text":"Came back for lunch.  This time I had the Lamb Burger with blackcurrant jam, butter lettuce, 2 tomato slices, some mayo on one side of the bun and a huge pickel (which I left on my pate).  Delicious and juicy.  It came with a salad or fries but I asked for the soup instead which was the Tomato Basil with Feta Cheese.  Not too bad but found it very tomatoey.    Service was good although they forgot to bring a menu for my friend."}
{"text":"I'm glad I found this place. Ive been staying at the fairmont up the road and the food is ridiculously priced and the food , not so great. At Thomsons I started with the potato and leak soup. It's too has I order another item or else I could have devoured the whole bowl because the soup was perfect in every way, well flavored , smooth and piping hot. I also ordered the steak bites and it was like a mini version of the fajitas. Not my favorite, but I haven't had any luck with beef in Calgary. I will be back this week to try the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 12+ adults for their breakfast buffet on a Saturday.  Excellent service, and a large variety of food!  There was brie, fresh fruit, danish, muffins, hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, frittata, an omelette station and more.  You were also able to order pancakes, waffles, and eggs benedict as part of the price.   I really enjoyed the ambiance and the location.  Would definitely come back for a breakfast or brunch."}
