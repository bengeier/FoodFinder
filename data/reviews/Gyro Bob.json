{"text":"We hired Gyro Bob for a company event of over 100 people. He didn't show up at the time he said he would so we called him 40 minutes before our event began. He claimed he was just about to EMAIL US and continued to come up with every excuse in the book - he put the thingy in and his truck wouldn't start (that would be called a \"key\" Bob), a mechanic was there, the weather was bad (what does this have to do with anything?) and the kicker...\"HE WASN'T GOING TO MAKE IT.\"  We, of course, wondered who he was sending instead and he laughed a nasty laugh and said \"No one! It's not my fault that my truck broke down!\" But apparently it was ours?  Between dealing with Bob's negativity (during phone conversations he would complain about previous events he worked), his continuous price changes (we even got a \"Oh, COME ON, I'm just a food truck guy trying to make some money!\" when he was questioned on the math of what was going to be owed in the end), and of course the fact that he ended our last phone conversation with a \"KISS OFF!!!\" and hung up...it's safe to say we shouldn't have ignored the red flags throughout the hiring process. Now, we understand that things come up that are out of one's control...but come on. He didn't show one ounce of remorse for cancelling on us 40 minutes prior to our event. In hindsight, we are pretty sure he was never planning on coming. If he was, what would he do with all of the food that was prepared for our 100 PERSON event? Best advice you'll ever receive: DO NOT HIRE GYRO BOB FOR AN EVENT."}
{"text":"Gyro Bob has made a reappearance in Kent.  From what I understand, Gyro Bob moved on to bigger and better ventures.  Tonight was the first night I've seen the \"truck\" back downtown.  According to The Dawgfather one cart over, Gyro Bob was bought out by someone else.  Now, I've never had the \"original\" Gyro Bob, but  I can say that the Gyro Bob I experienced tonight was damn good.  I was, however, heavily intoxicated, so I may be biased.  I ordered the pepperoni roll, which at $5 was a huge ripoff, but still really good.  Served warm, stuffed full of pepperoni and cheese, it really hit the drunk spot.  Add a side of The Dawgfather's fries and you'll find yourself in drunk munchie bliss."}
{"text":"He has the best cheesesteaks around. Nothing else is worth ordering. The gyro meat is pre-packaged and pre-sliced, not cut from a spit. Don't be put off by the fact that it is street meat from a metal cart. The cut of meat for the steak is probably lousy. It tastes delicious and is worth driving down to Kent and deal with the annoying drunk crowd on a weekend. He is only out on usually Thursday through Saturday unless there is an event."}
