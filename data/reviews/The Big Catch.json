{"text":"Fish and chips were very brown like oil hadn't been changed in awhile. My 4 year old even refused to eat because it looked funny.  Not a dedicated fish and chips restaurant, oil is used to fry many things so not that clean taste of a old school dedicated place."}
{"text":"I specifically asked yesterday if the tartar sauce was made in house, the lady said yes. I come home to find just 2 plastic packets of tartar sauce. 1. why don't they make their own. 2. why do they lie about it. 3. why do I only get 2 packets of the cheap packets? the food was good, but I'm not a fan of being lied to. I took a picture to share, but I can't add pics here for some reason. Basically I got the cheap white and green packets."}
{"text":"This place is totally recommended if you're a fan of French fries, fish and chips and poutein. Their French fries are crispy, delicious and big in each of them, pouteins are even more delicious with the sauce and cheese. I haven't tried their fish and chips yet but rumours said it's great! The only thing I didn't like about this place is that it is overly priced, high schoolers couldn't afford it for their lunch most of the time."}
{"text":"This is a gem place to go to. We had the halibut and chips and halibut and Greek salad. It was perfectly cooked to golden brown and flaky and the Greek salad was to die for. The place is very clean run by a husband and wife team. The service was very fast and good.
Five star for the food. I can't wait to come back.even with a little drive I will come with my family.
Big catch keep up the good work. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Their fish and chips portions are generous, reasonably priced and delicious. Their table service is friendly. The restaurant is clean. Their menu includes a variety seafood dishes as well other in and take away dishes. Overall after dining in many times i rate The Big Catch 5 plus stars.."}
{"text":"Wonderful... Friendly service, homemade chips, and a nice thick piece of halibut with a light crispy crust. Restaurant and washrooms were clean and tidy as well."}
{"text":"Fish was good but not as good as the old owners made it. Fries are actually really bad. Coleslaw is average. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I thought I'd try something different tonight and go with fish and chips.  The restaurant is clean and friendly. I ordered the two piece halibut and chips with a side of coleslaw to go, I think the bill was ~$13.  The fish was ok but small portions, I received a small container of cheese curds instead of coleslaw so I can't comment on that, and the most disappointing thing was the bland chips.  The chips were a thick cut and in no way crispy or anything to brag about.  The tartar sauce was from a packet and I got vinegar included but no salt.  Overall a very mediocre meal that was not enough for me to come back for more. $13 can be spent better somewhere else."}
{"text":"Sadly I made an order over the phone and when I got there to pick it up it wasn't even dropped not even started and they said they had a large order which they could've told me on the phone and save me a trip"}
{"text":"Although I do find the food good here, the service is absolutely horrible. I asked for extra tartar sauce with my meal and the cashier was extremely rude with me. She told me that she's going to just give me 2 and that I have to be ok with it. I was appalled at how she spoke to me and how rude she was. I don't think I will be going back there and it's all because of the service."}
{"text":"Just prior to under going a change in ownership I had noticed that the fish had become a bit thinner and batter became thicker. The lines out the door became shorter. 

Now with new owners in place the fish is a nice cut again, the batter is still a little thick for my preference, but cooked very well. 

The service was extremely friendly. He offered to take our order at the table since we had small kids and even gave the kids a candy when they finished their lunch. I was very pleased with this personal touch in service. 

I hope that this new owner can get the lines the previous owner once had."}
{"text":"Food is great but chef has a huge dandruff problem.  Made great food difficult to eat.   I hope he reads this and starts wearing a hat or something."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Often coming twice a month.  We enjoy the Haddock, Halibut and especially when they have the Cod (special item).  The coleslaw is delicious and the fries are crisp.

Service: from the people that take your order to the people making your food, AMAZING.  So friendly. 

Portions: Generous size, Dinner size is more than enough to fill you up.  We never leave hungry!"}
