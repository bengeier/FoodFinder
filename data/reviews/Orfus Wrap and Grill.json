{"text":"I have always hated falafels. I absolutely despised it. 
Every falafel I ate was always so dry and left a horrible taste in my mouth. 

Then comes along Orfus Wrap and Grill. What can I say about this place.

Yes, it doesn't have the best atmosphere.
Yes, the people that work there look at me and my cousin (Yelper Z) very weird like I was in the wrong place

BUT 

O MY GOODNESS! The falafel wrap was absolutely DELISH! 
nicely fried on the outside, yet tasty and somehow succulent in the inside. 
i'm drooling just thinking about it...

Plus, it was under $5!!!

I can't wait to go back. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmm"}
{"text":"I have owned my condo on Lawrence near Allen for almost 13 years and this place has been around for 11. Yet, I had never tried it. Probably because I do not drive and you cannot see the storefront from the sidewalk? It is located on a strip mall that wraps around a huge parking lot and the door of the restaurant is on the inside. Nevertheless, I had seen the name on Google Maps and was intrigued. 
I went in and was the only customer. The restaurant is clean and has a few tables but I suspect, most of the business is take-out. The menu consists of shawarmas (Lamb, chicken, beef), falafel, kebabs (beef or chicken) in a pita or as a platter with salad, hummus, garlic sauce and rice or fries for the meat options.
I ordered the Beef Shawarma plate. It was delicious and just the right amount of food. The shaved beef from the spit was tender and well done, not dry. The rice was great (kudos for the lack of frozen peas and carrots). It came with some ok hummus and a very potent garlic sauce, which is more crushed garlic then sauce. The salad was lacklustre but not limp and decently seasoned. The cook asks you, as is customary in this type of joint, if you want hot sauce or not. The dish was 7.99. With a guava nectar and tax, the whole thing came just above 11 dollars. Not a destination, but if you are shopping at Yorkdale, on Orfus Road, or live nearby, it is a great option."}
{"text":"Okay after viewing a dude in this review page. I ordered a combo (wrap fried pop). The falafel wrap is meh. The fries that come with it as combo is soggy and plain (no salt at all). Total of $4.49 + $3 + tax. I'd rather eat at Mary Browns across the street."}
{"text":"I actually haven't been to the place but I had the pleasure of being tailgated and cut off by a silver/blue BMW with the website on the back window of this place today. They were driving very aggressively west bound 401 this morning, was tailing a bunch of cars and weaving in and out speeding. I live in the area and will not be eating there now."}
{"text":"Small take-out/ Dine in sitting area.  (Fast Food) Great Falafel ... Shawarma's ... Great food portions and Price. Steady inflow of customers (fresh and popular)"}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for lunch. The staff were attentive and friendly. The food was excellent minus the fries, I found it a little on the soggy side. The price was fairly inexpensive! Glad we decided to check it out."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times over the past few months. The prices are unbeatable, the quality and quantity of the food are superb and I'm flaming as a 170 pound male that is working out 6 days a week.

If you're looking for a local shawarma spot, this is it. You will not be disappointed."}
