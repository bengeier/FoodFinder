{"text":"Through a co-worker of mine I have found this gem located in Vaughan. To me, I think it is one of the best vietnamese cuisines in the GTA period. Their pho cannot be outmatched! Give this place a try the food and service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice and trendy decor but I am disappointed at their foods. I would prefer Pho Real restaurant and/or Hu Tieu Nam Vang restaurant around that area."}
{"text":"I totally forgot to post a review for Pho Anise. Whoops! Silly me! I've been to this place three times, as of yesterday. 

My coworkers had introduced me to this place, and so I thought I'll try it out. I have been to other pho places in the GTA - mainly in Markham/Scarborough, and they don't even come close to this place. I am surprised that this place only has 10 reviews. Come on Yelpers! Don't be shy to write a review of this place. 

After glancing through the menu, I noticed they only had one vegetarian pho option (# 31 on their menu) which could be good and bad. As for the other vegetarian options, you have Padthai, fried or steamed rice. Who comes to a pho place to have fried/steamed rice or even Pad Thai? Maybe you do fellow Yelper/reader? Don't worry, I won't judge you ;) 

The nice thing about this pho place is that, they actually use vegetarian broth, instead of the traditional chicken or fish broth/stock. The served asked me all the three times, and I was happy that they did. Normally, the other pho places I've been to, they never ask, or have the option with the vegetarian stock/broth. 

It didn't take long to get the food, and it smelt great. I added the usual basil and bean sprouts to it. The temperature, texture, taste, vegetables were just perfect. The rice noodles were cooked properly, and all the three times I was this close to finishing the entire bowl. It sure is filling, and definitely puts a smile on my face every time. There's no regret in coming back to this place, but if they could have slightly one or two extra vegetarian dishes for the pho, that will be great. Otherwise, its definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Delicious pho, banh mi and chicken with vermicelli. Everything is fresh and well made and at a reasonable price (appetizers in the $4-5 range and mains in $8-10 range). This gem, hidden in an industrial complex in Vaughan, is one of the top Vietnamese restaurants in York Region."}
{"text":"I am not very impressed with this place. I ordered takeout and had to wait an hour for my order. Then I was accused of not paying for my food when I received it, even though I had already paid upon ordering. The food was definitely not worth the wait and I will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"I love pho and have tried MANY different pho places around Toronto while living here AND Orange County, California since moving there. During a visit to Toronto a few years ago, my brother recommended Pho Anise. After eating here, I could not eat the regular pho I regularly ate at in California. 

The broth is perfect! It does not wreak of MSG like most other pho I've had. Every visit to Toronto must include a meal at Pho Anise now. The whole family loves this place. My dad's a very picky eater too, but actually complimented the pho he ate here!

My brother always gets the chicken vermicelli which is great. Not dry at all. 

The customer service is awesome too. Very friendly and hospitable people! They've done a beautiful job with the interior as well. 

5 stars minus 1 because of the remote location and early closing time. 

Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Wait service was nonexistent and the food wasn't what I ordered. The waitress had to be asked to get us water and we had to fill out the order form ourself, which is fine, but they just had the paper on the table without saying anything. Only positive was that the green tea was nice."}
{"text":"Take out order: spring rolls, and rice dishes.

Place: dark, hidden, plenty of parking, modern decor, ample space, kid friendly (they have booster seats), clean.

Staff: I picked up take out so haven't interacted enough with any staff.

Food: First of all, the spring rolls were very good, crispy and not overly greasy, filling was meaty, over all roll wasn't too think which made it easier to eat. Came with small salad and nice nuoc mam (fish sauce). The nuoc mam was good, not too salty but definitely full flavoured, well balanced sweet and tartness, very good, not too watered down like some other places.

The rice dishes were accompanied by soup/broth!!! Excellent! Too many places skip this very important step, thank you Pho Anise! Broth was not the beef pho broth, tastes like a chicken soup, but it was good with the rice.

Grilled chicken was good, well flavoured, nicely cooked. Steamed egg had faux crab meat in it, I've never seen that before, wasn't bad, just new to me. Decent tasting. The grilled pork chop was not good. Too bland, needs more marinating. Rice was great, fish sauce good, salad was decent, but tomatoes were a bit old. Fried egg was medium-well, I think the yolk could have been more softer or runny for better mixing with the rice. 

Overall a good meal, we will be back to dine-in and try the pho next time.

3.9 stars"}
{"text":"The food is so good, the atmosphere is awesome. Like there is a water fountain cascading. I'm going there today :)"}
{"text":"Location:  8750 Jane Street Unit 5-6 Concord
Price: $$
Service: Good

Pho Anise was not a disappointment- especially being Vietnamese I am more critical. Of course it was a must to have pho at a Vietnamese restaurant. One of the most important flavour in pho is the aroma of anise within the soup, which a lot of pho restaurantds lack in their soup and this restaurant had that locked down.  My mom who is extremely picky with her pho, even stated that soup base was decent. We also ordered com tam suon tau hu ki (rice with pork and fried bean cure) and it came with a pop and a spring roll. I really like the way they had marinated the pork. Usually the bean cured is wrapped around fried/battered shrimp so out side of it is cripsy and inside it is soft and chewy. 

The service was decent and they were really friendly. How the restaurant is design is really nice and very modern. They had the front door and back door open- which was really cool and the restaurant itself was bright with a lot of sunlight. We were talking to the owner and she stated that the restaurant isn't open late since its' main customers usually comes around lunch time. 

Verdict: Drop by lunch time"}
{"text":"Clean and specious place with pretty good Vietnamese  food. 

Compare to Pho Dau Bo, flavour was a little lighter, but satisfied. 

Wasn't too crazy about their Fresh and fried spring rolls though. Could barely taste the shrimp in the fresh rolls. It appeared to be thick but it was full of air."}
{"text":"Group of colleagues finished attending a conference early and we all agreed to have Pho for dinner. 

My first reaction is to find a restaurant in Richmond Hill as they tend to be better, at least in perception. 

Our search on Yelp helped us find this Vietnamese restaurant close to where we were, with good reviews. 

I am overly concerned with cleanliness and pleased to see a very clean restaurant, with nice decor. 

We ordered appetizers which come in pcs of 4, and the owner/waitress politely suggested that she could change to 5 pcs to accommodate our group.   Very nice gesture on her part. 

We all had pho which was served reasonably fast, and in very large portions. The soup base was well flavoured, with an addictive aroma of anise. 

Nothing beats: Good food, Clean place and excellent service.   Yes, especially, excellent service. 

This is a gem in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great place for Pho from all the places I've tried in Vaughan.

Going back for the regular bowl of Pho,

Can't wait to explore their menu.

Environment is great. Great seatings for groups."}
{"text":"I was a customer when this place first opened and I'm happy to say they've stayed consistent, PHO still tastes amazing, don't skimp on the meat and they're the only pho place in the area that serves me my deep friend tentacles!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the area and decided to drop in to eat.

This place has changed names to pho anh vu, and apparently the original owner of pho anise was there as well. Not sure too sure of the relationship though

Thr exterior and the location are really odd, and it was a bit tricky to find, but well worth it.

The interior was clean, spacious and clean! 

Food was decently priced, good variety and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Great family operated establishment with a good selection of Pho. 
Nice modern decor which is nice compared to most other pho restaurants in the area. 
They have a great offering for customers not familiar to the cuisine. 
Lunch combos were fairly large, and reasonably priced. 
For under $10, I got the Beef Pho, spring roll, and a drink.

I enjoyed it and will be back. 
One of the nicer pho restaurants to try in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Very clean place, food is consistently good. But the place is now operating by new Vietnamese owner, it's Pho Anh Vu.
Service is great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time after my friend had raved about the fried chicken wings. 

The decor is much nicer than most pho restaurants that I have been to. The water fountain is a nice touch, provided that your bladder isn't full, which would make you want to visit the washroom nearby!

I ordered the fried chicken wings, and rare beef and beef ball pho. The former was delicious, crispy, and perfect. The latter was flavourful and lives up to the restaurant name of having anise in the soup base. 

Service was prompt and friendly. Mind you, I went on a Saturday just after 2 pm. If you're in the area, it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Pho Anise is a very acceptable Vietnamese restaurant in this part of town. It is very clean and modern with very friendly, efficient and polite staff. 

I love the Bun Boe Hue here. It isn't the absolute best, I have had better in Vancouver and San Francisco but it suffices. I like that it comes with pig blood jello. And it is nice and spicy. 

Their fresh spring rolls are huge, but the sauce could use and improvement. I think it is just hoisin sauce with some peanuts, I have a better recipe maybe I should share. 

The deep fried spring rolls are good with a taro filing. My slight complaint is that they are not freshly fried to order and come out more warm than hot."}
{"text":"Pho Anise is an amazing looking Vietnamese restaurant! 

The deco is so chic, so spacious and offers patrons a lot of privacy! From the heavy tinted front windows to those high partitions for the booth seating. I was not even sure if I was eating here alone as the only table or there were others and I have to stuck my head out in order to get my waitress attention.

There are only 3 choices of 1 Pho and 2 rice dishes from the lunch special menu. I hope Pho Anise can add a few more in? From $7.99, it includes a spring roll, a main and a can of pop.

Well Done Beef Pho ($7.99) was really enjoyable. The portion was perfect for lunch and the well flavoured broth has the aroma of anise :)

Love the complimentary cold tea they serves during the summer."}
{"text":"I have always found pho restaurants to be very hit and miss but this place is a gem. Food is always fresh and delicious! The staff are very friendly as it is a wonderfully run family business.

Genuine Vietnamese cuisine at its best. My wife and I first stumbled upon this place from a friend's recommendation. We have been regulars since whenever we crave any kind of tasty Asian cuisine. 

Highly recommended. You really haven't had real authentic pho in Toronto until you have tried this place."}
{"text":"Pho Anise is very difficult to find. It is the only business open in this particular plaza (as of this writing) and is inside the plaza, so it's not visible from the road. I walked into a spacious, clean, but empty restaurant.

The menu is quite large and contains much of the same items as other Vietnamese restaurants. I decided to order what I normally order at a local Vietnamese restaurant chain -- the grilled chicken and fried egg on rice ($9) and decided to include the spring rolls ($4). The meal came with a soup. The soup was super hot temperature-wise, so be careful! The spring rolls were fresh and tasty. Yum! Though it's quite pricey for what you get -- two spring rolls. The grilled chicken was very tasty, but nothing special compared to other places.

The owner was definitely more attentive that the wait staff at other local Vietnamese chains, but it could just be that I was the only patron at 1pm on a Monday. I asked if they accept credit card, but she only confirmed that they accept debit.

I'll have to come back and try their other dishes."}
