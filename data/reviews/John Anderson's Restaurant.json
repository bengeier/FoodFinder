{"text":"Its a place where you can get a big burger, get greasy fries, and guzzle it down with a can of pop / milk shake.  They serve a pretty mean chicken souvlaki and gyro which is cut right off the spigit.

This is what i remembered about the place... you would find the people who worked at Licks coming here to have a bite to eat.  This place would be open late at 2am and it would be filled with people having a craving for some comfort food after leaving the clubs with friends.

I have fond memories eating here with friends when we just wanted  a place to chat and it was well past midnight."}
{"text":"Came here super hungover looking for breakfast which is scarce in this area.

The place is super dirty and scary. 

We all ordered the Breakfast Combo:

3 Eggs - Sunnyside up (eggs are eggs right)
Homefries - They were okay. No salt of anything.
Sausage - Overcooked and scary looking!
Toast - Toast was toast. Too much margarine though.

Probs won't come back here again. It was scary.

Though, kudos to the lady at the front who was both the waitress and the cook. Double Duty.

{"text":"A few of us went there the other day for lunch the other day.  It's not a big place, seats about 20 people and basically you order and wait.  Whilst waiting, I took a good look around and man, could this place need a good cleaning!

We ordered the basics... burgers, hot dogs, fries and onion rings.  You order the toppings you want ahead of time and they dress your burger / hot dog for you.  The toppings seemed to be plentiful on both... at least, I had no complaints.

The lady manning the counter was doing double-duty as the cook which made for slow (but not unreasonable) service.  When our food was ready we all set to dive into to some greasy comfort food!  Hmm.  I didn't quite satisfy that craving.

The food was, well, sorta... meh.  Their burgers are large and cooked thoroughly, their hot dogs lack flavour... a street vendor would be your better bet (note: there's one just around the corner at the GO station).

The fries 'appeared' to be hand cut but were under cooked and had a real 'potato-ee' texture and flavour.  They were really just... kinda... 'non-descript'.  And the onion rings?  Oh my.  They were so oily and heavy tasting... and so over cooked that I think the onion actually dissolved in a few of them.

I'm afraid the two-star 'Meh. I've experience better.' rating will have to do for now."}
{"text":"GROSS. So disgusting. I don't even know what to say, other than never coming back here again.

We had breakfast here on Sunday morning. Next time I'm taking the bus to Dufferin and Steeles and going to Cora's....

I don't know why I didn't just buy a carton of eggs and some ham and made his myself. The eggs were normal, the sausages were small, the place was DIRTYYYY - the floors looked like they have never been washed and it smelled like a Detroit crack house... 

Thank you, John Answerson's, for not giving me food poisoning... I'm actually really surprised."}
{"text":"Went to John Anderson's near my work location for lunch which is kinda still unknown. John Anderson's looks very much like your run of the mill small neighbourhood diners. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner eats of the diner variety.  It's in a location where this type of food is severely lacked, so they have a niche here.

Now I got a quick homeburger combo with added cheese which cost a very reasonable price of just under $6 after tax (drink not included). The burger does take a while to make so make sure you're not in a hurry like I was. I believe if you can, call and order ahead for pick up cause the wait was about 10-15 mins.

Now once I got back to work to eat my lunch, the burger was literally drenched in grease.  Now I know burgers aren't the healthiest food available, but let's be honest... I wasn't expecting this.  The wax paper that was used was pretty much dripping in grease and the fries... well they're also of the greasy variety.  They are the thick cut fries and weren't really crispy at all (I had some fresh on the way back to work).  So they were deep fried without any REAL purpose as you probably could have baked them and would have turned out the same.  

First bite, not bad... but I got a feeling the grease played a huge part.  The patties weren't dry (grease) and they did give me a ton of toppings.  I got the traditional garnish with ketchup and mayo.  The taste was there, but if you can feel worse than McDonalds, here's your winner.  I wasn't thrilled with the fries as I think they were deep fried without any purpose.  They were a soggy and uninspired mess.  The only possible redemption would have been, if it was a poutine, maybe... but c'mon fries not crispy, sorry not feeling it.

So overall, John Anderson's isn't horrible.  I mean if you're a healthy type I would say stay far away.  If you can feel worse than McD's, here's the place to visit.  I haven't tried their breakfast or dinner, so who knows maybe it's better for those meals.  I think if I am really in need of grease, I would come back.  Cause it wasn't bad in that regard.. the flavour was there and it's very reasonably priced.  But for this level of unhealthiness, I think I rather go to something just as horrible like Popeye's Fried Chicken, but that's my take... what's yours?"}
