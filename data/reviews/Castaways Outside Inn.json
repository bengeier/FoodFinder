{"text":"Meh. So I don't mind a good dive bar but this experience was completely lackluster.  The inside is smokey and dark. The outside is smokey and bright.   Generally I like the idea of this place: An outdoor bar and a ton of outdoor seating but the ambiance is yinzer-chic.  The menus is quite typical Pittsburgh bar food. wings, fries, fried cheese, fried mushrooms, fried everything.   The service was spotty but the girls was kinda trying...i guess...I asked her a couple questions and she was like \"I normally don't work here, this place sucks\" (hard sell).  I laughed its a dive bar I'm not expecting my ass to be kissed. My mom ordered wrap and I got a salad. Took about 50 minutes. The pseudo waitress apologized and just explained \"I told you this place is a mess\". Haha, she was being sassy enough for me so I felt no need to add any.   The food was bleh. A bit cold, nothing earth shattering.   Pros: Outdoor seating with outdoor bar, FREE Wings on Thursdays, Sassy, bitter waitress (yeah that's pro), cheap-ish  Cons: SLOOOOW, underwhelming menu, smoking, outdoor area is just made up of old furniture ( not in an eclectic way, but the yinzer way)  Overall: Might go back ....MAYBE......in 2 years...."}

Everyone is friendly, the drinks aren't bad prices and we always end up on the dance floor. I love the outdoor seating and live DJ. Only downfall is the inside smoking!"}
