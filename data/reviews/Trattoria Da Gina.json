{"text":"Food is delicious!!! Everything is fresh and tasty... always have a challenge deciding what to order!! Clearly very underrated ..a hidden gem! Chicken calzone is a must try along with the Margarita Pizza!!"}
{"text":"We felt like calzones and we ordered it from this location. We were a bit put back from the expensive prices on the menu but we NEEDED some quality calzones! They were HUGE, tasty and hit the spot. I'd like to order from here more often but the price tag will limit us from orsering here only rarely."}
{"text":"Best trattoria in Laval.  The Pizza is one of the best I've had, if not the best in Laval.  I've been there many times and always go crazy figuring out what I'll be eating, as everything is so good!  From the home made pasta to the Pizza with fresh toppings, this place is a must try for anyone looking to taste some simple italian cooking.  Try: Fried gnocchi poutine or the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"So my quest for good pizza and subs brought us here. It was a recommendation from a family member and boy were they right!  The pizzas and subs were just amazing!! The crust on the pizza was crunchy, just enough toppings made it right. Fantastic (right up there with Manzos). The sub bread is made with the pizza dough and man was it satisfying. Definitely bookmarking this place!  It was a touch on the expensive side but so worth it!   On to the next Laval adventure!"}
