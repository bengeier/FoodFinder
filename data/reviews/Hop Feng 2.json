{"text":"If you are ok with hole-in-the-wall local Chinese places, this one is great. Typical deal... run down place, same person all the time, etcetera, etcetera. The food is good, the portions are big, and the prices are good. This is not gourmet fare though, fairly typical american style Chinese fare.The people are always nice, and once you call a few times, they know you.   If you are in the neighborhood and want a quick-fix, by all means get take-out from there. They don't deliver, and the place is run-down, so why not take the yumminess home and watch some TV?"}
{"text":"Each Chinese fast food place is different. I've order plenty of times from this particular location and my order has been what I expected. Everyone has a different opinion on what they consider good Chinese food.  I order just about the same thing every time and each time my order have been great. I found what I like from this restaurant and I will continue my business with them. The service is also quick. In my opinion this place is fine with me."}
{"text":"Best fast food of the Asian variety. Very friendly, tasty selections, quick service and decent prices.....Not the best if you're looking for dining atmosphere.  There is no delivery, but we live close so it's not a big deal for us."}
{"text":"Local chinese food, fit for a king. Food portions are huge, for little money.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Hop feng has been my home Chinese food place and the people honestly know me and my order. The food is very good with no MSG. And very well priced."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed I came here on Friday with my family to eat Chinese and today inside by the table next to the window there was a spider and cockaroch that's just nasty  to see when people are eating I always ate here but this is my last time....... very gross and food wasn't the same"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 times here so far and haven't had any issues yet. Food is actually very delicious and reasonably priced. When I've ordered in, both times they were very polite and always fast with their food."}
{"text":"We absolutly love this place! Best Chinese food in Mint Hill. It's family owned. They are awesome. My boyfriend and my kids love tbis place."}
{"text":"We LOVE Hop Feng 2!! The food is always hot and of great quality and the customer service is awesome!! No matter what you order, from one thing or several, it's always just 10 minutes. We have our favorites, but I try to order something different from time to time to try it all. Their pork fried rice is flavorful and always spot on. Don't let the appearance of the shopping center scare you away, you will not be disappointed. I would rate it the best take-out in the area for sure!"}
{"text":"I love hop fang b/c there's not a great amount of good Chinese food here in charlotte and I haven't had anything that I didn't like here. The house Special Mi Fun, Broccoli & Chicken, chicken and vegetables, chicken wings, egg rolls, and egg foo young has been fresh and full of taste. If you give them a chance I really think you will love Hop Feng! Oh and the Family who owns hop feng are very accommodating!"}
{"text":"My go to place for quick chinese food. The food is good, especially for quick service. The service is quick and the people are nice. Exactly what you can expect from a quick service chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out in Charlotte. Huge portions and great prices. They have been very consistent for the 15+ years I have been eating there. The same lady is always there, I feel bad because she never has a day off. Seriously I have never been there when she wasn't there. My favorites, sesame chicken, general Tso's, cashew chicken, sweet and sour chicken. Great egg rolls and fried rice."}
{"text":"I moved from Mint Hill to Huntersville about 4 months ago and I haven't been able to find any place in my area that comes anywhere close!!! As far as Chinese takeout goes, Hop Feng's definitely has the best value and quality of any place I've been to anywhere in Charlotte and I've been to a lot! Their Four Seasons, Happy Family, chicken wings, Crab Rangoon......The Best!!!! Unfortunately I've had better Sesame chicken which I know is popular with the masses but you can't win them all. The sweet and sour chicken however is all white meat and you get a ton of it!!!! I make it my business to order food from here any time I am even remotely close by.  Sure do miss this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this little place! It is a reliable whole-in-the-wall, neighborhood restaurant. I've never stayed to eat there, it is a little run down, but it is a perfect take-out place. You are always greeted by the same friendly people who take your order and get it done fast. The prices are great and the portions are generous. There are several other (American) Chinese places to choose from in the area, but this one just always gets it right. I have tried most of the items on the menu and favor them all over their competition. Their egg rolls, sweet & sour chicken, and vegetable lo mein are my favorites, not to mention their Chinese donuts are just a sugary, melt-in-your mouth piece of heaven! If you are in this area of Mint Hill, drop in and get some take-out, I promise it won't be the last time you make your way to Hop Feng II!"}
{"text":"We ate here last night as we were passing through Charlotte on our up north. We ordered take out to bring back to our hotel, based on some good reviews. We've been in Mississippi (military) for the last several months and have found zero good Chinese restaurants and I was excited to try this place. The chicken wings were amazing. My husband liked his lo mein. My shrimp and garlic sauce had no flavor, except some sweetness in which I thought was supposed to be a spicy dish. None of this was bad/good enough to warrant a review from a very weary (and pregnant) traveler.  BUT This sharp as hell piece of plastic was just found in my daughther's fried rice. My four year old daughter. I am livid. No, I'm not trying to get any type of compensation etc, but just want people to be aware of the possibility of something like this. Especially if it's being eaten by a little."}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's fast, and it's not particularly good. I liked my lo mein, but the egg rolls were way too thick and greasy. It's average. I'm sure I'll eat there again."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings & pork fried rice in town. Fast service food is always excellent. Anytime I'm craving some Chinese food specifically chicken wings I get it from here. Great family that runs it. I don't know if they have any correlation to the other Hop Feng but this one is far better and is totally different in my opinion. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Chopsticks in Matthews is 10times better, All we tasted was salt, salt,  and more salt. The eggrolls was hard and where were the stuffing? The fried rice tasted like white rice with rubber shrimp in it. Worst Chinese ever."}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to place for Chinese takeout. Our family's favorites are the General Tso's Chicken and the Fried Dumplings. One of the few (only?) places I could feed 7 people for under $30 and we would often have leftovers!  Family run place, very nice people. They are open nearly every day (can you say Christmas Eve Chinese takeout?). If you call in food is usually ready in 10-15 minutes unless they are slammed.  Worth a try if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for take out Chinese in my Lawyers Road neck of the woods. They can get pretty busy on the weekend nights so make sure to call ahead and get your order in.   Clean restaurant and good service. The lady that works the counter is nice and to the point. They seem to have every option you could want from a typical Chinese place.   The food is always good. I have tried a few different plates now and none have disappointed me. I'm obviously going to keep coming back as long as I'm on this side of town! Glad to have a trustworthy Chinese food place so close to home."}
{"text":"Each Chinese fast food place is different and each has their own speciality. This place's speciality is their wings and their crab ragoon! We love it and order often. The owners are really nice, especially the wife!   I gave this place four stars because I'm not a big fan of their rice. as a chinese place, rice is important to them. In the past, my rice was always hard/crunchy and dry. Cooked with the bbq pork makes it smells really bad. Thats just me though. I don't eat take out rice often so I don't mind not ordering rice with my dish."}
{"text":"This place is not consistent at all. The first time that I visited, the food was great! I ordered the shrimp fried rice and veggie low mein a month later and it was trash! I figured it was a different cook, so I revisited the establishment today, and I am done! The shrimp fried rice had only shrimp and rice. What happened to the onions, eggs, and peas? The low mein was extremely bland. I will never go there again...play at your own risk people."}
