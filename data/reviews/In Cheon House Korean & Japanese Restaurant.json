{"text":"Pretty nice place. Good food. I had a grey time in there with my friends. We had a pork hot pot and a bi bim bab. Love bi bim bab a lot! The side dish are also great."}
{"text":"I am a huge frequenter of Korean restaurants and this is my favourite one in Scarbs. All the food we've ordered have been good. My favourite dish is definitely their kimchi stew and I am very picky about that. It is comparable to Buk Chang Soon Tofu, but Buk Chang's is definitely the best. Their side dishes are good, sometimes under or over seasoned, but not the worst. 

Service is usually speedy and fast and we don't have to wait long to be seated."}
{"text":"If you're in Scarborough and have a hankering for a really good soup, look no further than In Cheon House's Pork Bone Soup! I order mine with just a little spice because I can't handle the heat.

The restaurant is small and clean. Good traffic during the lunch service so the other items in the menu must be good. Service is attentive but tailed off as the place got busier."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for about 4 years now. 

I agree with other yelpers that the side dishes are average. But my favourite here has always been the pork bone soup, kimchi fried rice and the crispy chicken! Those three dishes have never disappointed me! 

It's pretty busy on Fridays and Saturdays so I suggest you to come in earlier before it gets packed. The servers are nice, but there's always a shortage of them especially during peak hours. 

Overall, good service, good food and is definitely one of the better Korean restaurants in Scarborough in my opinion!"}
{"text":"My visit today was the best that I've had at this place. It wasn't too busy and the service was fast and courteous.  This was probably my eight visit to this korean spot.  I had my favorite (Pork Bone Soup) and tried the fried dumplings; enjoyed the side dishes.  Everything tasted good."}
{"text":"Had to come back and write about the thing I love from here the most- the salmon lover maki. 

Maybe it's the different play of textures with the spicy salmon sashimi on the inside, the extra layer of salmon sashimi on the outside, sprinkled with tempura bits on the outside and then drizzled with spicy mayo.

Or maybe it's their sushi rice mixture...something about this maki keeps me going back for more. So much so that the waitress told me today, \"it's been an long time\" (since I last saw her). 

Well I'm back. And sharing with you this yummy dish. Yes it's a Korean resto. But what the heck- they serve a really damn good salmon maki! Call me a Salmon lover for real!"}
{"text":"Let me start firstly by saying this place is literally the hardest little hole in the wall to find, but it's in the plaza that is right next to Sheppard road if that helps! 

I got the E9 bulgogi with rice and I really enjoyed it! I love bulgogi and this did not disappoint! We also got the spicy rice cakes to share and I really enjoyed those as well, def spicy! 

Its not the best koreon place in the area, but I was satisfied with my food! (3.5 more than a 3)"}
{"text":"Decent authentic korean food in Scarborough. Although better options are available in the North York & Downtown areas, if your in Scarborough, there aren't many 'real' korean restaurants to choose from. I have not had any of the sushi here, but have dined here many times from their Korean dishes and their Korean BBQ combos. I have never been disappointed from this place. Its decent, clean, and one of the only options for Korean in  Scarborough!"}
{"text":"Service felt rushed but food was tasty and prices quite reasonable :) It was full on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Hard spot to find on Sheppard and Glen, but a great spot for yourself and a few friends.

Portions are generous and as well as their sides. Been here a few times and food was okay. 
Service is quick and food comes out at a decent pace!

This location is alright if you're looking for some $$ (11$-30$) priced korean food with a few pals or by yourself in the area."}
{"text":"I found this place due to my fellow yelpers. It can be a little confounding when you're in the immediate vicinity, and craving something other than Chinese cuisine. Located in an older strip plaza, there's plenty of free parking on hand.

I ordered the soft tofu with seafood and it definitely delivered the savoury flavour and soft texture that I was looking for. The portions are substantial. My dining companions had the pork bone soup and the noodles with black bean sauce, both satisfying according to them."}
{"text":"We did not dabble in much, we only ate the buddae jung-chol (?) For 2 people $30.
 In English it's called Army Stew. It's basically ramen noodles in a spicy broth with everything in it (pork, hotdogs, spam, rice cakes, tofu, beansprouts, kimchi).

 It's pretty awesome for a cold day if you ask me. And honestly , you can't really mess it up . It's on the spicier side, as the broth cooks it gets spicier. Comes with 2 rice. 

It was nicely heated inside and there were maybe a few empty tables . Considering it was boxing day, and none of the nearby sushi houses were open we were happy with our visit. Waitress was attentive but didn't talk much."}
{"text":"The service is not the greatest. Not sure of the server was having an off day or she's always like that. We came here on a whim. The menu is overwhelming and not well organized so it took us awhile to get through it all and decide what we wanted to eat. Some of the items printed on the menu aren't even served. Or weren't being served that day?

I got my food (bibimbap) right away and we got our shared plate (Chicken Katsu) but my friend's lunch main didn't come for ages!!
Later we asked for separate bills and were told they couldn't do that. They could print out 3 bills (one for each item ordered). We said okay but instead got 1 bill with all three items on it.

It just seemed like the place was disorganized with poor service in general. Our server was dropping glasses full of water near other patrons on her way back to the kitchen and just not seeming to care how her behaviour translated to customers. Maybe the food is amazing? I'm not sure... My dish was good but nothing extraordinary. Neither was the chicken katsu. So I wouldn't go here again. I'm sure I can find better places with better, more friendly staff."}
{"text":"BITCH THERE WAS A FUCKING HAIR in my food. 
I came here with my family etc after watching a movie for some new food, we've had korean food before and this is by far one of the worst places I've been to. The prices are a little too high for the quality of food and the time we had to wait for it, others that came before us got their food faster when we had ordered the same things, spicy rice cakes. Me and my dad both ordered a stew and while I was eating, I found a single hair in it, and another hair in the side dishes. I went out of my way to write a yelp review on how bad our service was. I wont be coming here again."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a weekday night, and it is a pretty hidden spot in scarborough that serves korean food. 

This restaurant has been around for quite some time. I have to say though that overall i'm a bit disappointed in this restaurant. Although the price was decent, and the food selection was wide, the actual food itself wasn't that great. 

We had ordered several dishes included the hot plate pork belly that korean are famous for, and the chinese inspired korean sweet and sour chicken, along with the pork bone soup. 

Overall the food isn't that great, and doesn't stand out. The side dishes are slightly better as the side dishes are not bad and pretty average.

i would say if your in the area and you crave korean food, you can go to the place if you want to simply satisfy that craving, but i wouldn't go here if given a choice, and probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I actually had 2 options fighting for top spot as my Lunch-of-the-day.
One hand, the pricier($11.00+) Galbi Jjim looks authentic on paper.
Two hand, a less costly Kal Guk Soo.  Noodle, me, noodle, me, noo...
Upon asking staff for suggestion, I chose C3 as it happens to be her Fav.

C3  -  Incheon House Kal Guk Soo($7.95) - Special Food Category

     Noodle indeed has textural chewy biteness, surprised to get quality.
     Broth more flavourful than Clear Broths(that need salt/pepper to taste).
     Portion is undeniably an intensive Meal in itself, time consuming in fact.
     The only downside, Oil from Pan-fried Toppings were poured on top.
     Leaving the top of the soup broth more oily than needed.    3.5'd

I think I will stick with the Special Food Category also for next time.
At least to figure out why 6(!) Kimchi Wang Mandu would cost $8.95(?).
Koreans must know something different about Dumplings Chinese don't."}
{"text":"Came in around 9pm on Saturday night.  It's a relatively small place - with about 10 tables or so.  The side dishes were what would be found in the usual korean restaurant (ie potatoes, bean sprout, kimchi, etc), .  Tried the ginseng with chicken - the chicken was a bit stringy.  However the soup was absolutely delicious and perfect on a cold winter night.  Overall I would probably get it again."}
{"text":"We came here after we discovered the original place we wanted to go had closed down. This place is not very big however there is a lot of seating available. The food was very good, we both had black bean noodle cravings and they were very satisfied last night. We ordered 1 regular black bean noodles(for him) and 1 seafood black bean noodles for me. They were delicious and I will be back for them again! Very nice to have a Korean restaurant that's closer to home for me."}
{"text":"Happiness. On a night where it's -25 (with windchill -35) degrees, all I want is hot pot or spicy Korean soup. We opted for the latter tonight. My first time at In Cheon. My brother's recommendation.

Sides:
Kimchi, bean sprouts, japchae, beans in sweet soy, mashed sweetened potato. The last one was delicious. Had I not been trying to watch the carbs, I would have eaten quite a bit more.

Ordered:

Gamjatang Jeongol ($22.99?)- Pork bone soup, family style. Four big, meaty pieces of pork bone, potatoes, 4 dumplings, rice cake slices, sprouts, veggies, kimchi and enoki mushrooms, plus two bowls of rice. They supposedly make their broths without MSG. Good stuff. Would definitely feed a minimum of 2 people, if not 3 people.

Grilled mackarel with soondubu chigae ($11.99) - Grilled mackarel was a good sized piece of fish. Super fresh. Served on a sizzling plate. Skin was crisp. Flesh was tender. Soondubu chigae, or soft tofu soup, comes with either seafood or beef. I chose seafood. Shrimp, mussels, mussels. Lots of seafood in this soup. I was impressed. This combo comes with rice. For $11.99, it's a super deal! It thrilled the cheap Asian in my father's blood. It was tasty too!

Seafood Pa Jeon ($13.99?) - BIG portion. Lots of seafood. Inside was lovely and soft. Outside was crispy. Everything I want in a giant seafood pancake! Oysters, squid, shrimp...my brother even found a tiny whole crab in there! If they had nothing else on their menu, I would still come back here just for this. Once again, if I wasn't watching the carbs, I'd have eaten so much more of this. Sigh. I want more. NOW. 

Other notes: Big tables. Lots of space. Bright space. Clean. Server understood enough English to get us our food. Spoke fluent Mandarin and Korean. She was ethnically Korean, but had spent a number of years in China. 

Total damage for the night after tips and before tax: $55 something for 4 people + leftovers enough for lunch tomorrow (if we cook rice).

I believe I will be coming here a considerable amount in the near future. =D

P.S. It's been about half an hour since I left the restaurant and my tummy is still warm and happy. Good times."}
{"text":"Nice and clean, but not enough tables...every single night we always dine at this place especially when you are tired from work..i always orders spicy seafood jompong and for my husband is soup bone..always ready for you appetizer and our server is very nice and friendly Fiona is the best! I love this place."}
{"text":"its truly not good..... the dishes were either too oil or salty, highly over priced. the service and environment was soso.... really , i dont think anyone who had meal in YONGE&FINCH or korean will like these store"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for some cold noodle. They kimchi here is better than most other places I have been to, a small thing but if you enjoy kimchi you will appreciate it. Decent sized menu compared to most other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Delicious & good prices. Get the rice cakes with ramen! There's a lot of options with a large menu. The gimbap is also really good, and their hot pot dishes."}
{"text":"NOTE:  I'm almost confident that there was an ownership change and whoever is cooking here does not know Korean food as what they serve here is NOT KOREAN FOOD.

I'm always sad when I have to write a bad update.  I haven't been to this restaurant in some time and when my mom came in to visit me from Korea, I happily took her over to Incheon House for some soon du bu and kimchi jji gae.  

The restaurant looked different as they took away the booths that used to line the front of the dining room and replaced it with basic tables.  They had expanded their menu by good 4-5 pages to include many questionable items and the alarm bells were going off in my mind at this point.  

Lo and behold, the banchans that arrived were sad sad sad.  The kimchi was the worst I've had as under-pickled cabbage slices were haphazardly tossed in pasty kimchi seasoning.  The bean sprouts were bland, the japchae tasted like tsuyu and the obligatory mashed potato was goopy and mushy.  The braised beans were possibly the most edible thing.  

The mains arrived and the kimchi jjigae was the most unappetizing and confused version of the dish I've ever encountered.  Bean sprouts, ham slices, rice cake slices, overly chewy pork slices and potato noodles were swimming in a broth that was way too acidic and didn't taste anything like kimchi jjigae.  It was almost as if they had thrown in a bunch of leftover banchan into a stonepot and boiled it with some kimchi juice and water.  Truly disgusting.  

My mom's soon du bu wasn't any better with palpable taste of ajinomoto they used as the flavour base and the old/freezer burnt mixed seafood swimming in a pot of confused broth full of potato slices.  Who puts potatoes in soon du bu?  

Needless to say, I felt so awful about taking my mom here for lunch and will never return to this place for food.  EVER."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing 2nd visit.
Not really happy with the side dish selection and didn't taste all that great either. They had my favorite soy bean side dish but its just not done the same like other Korean restaurants.

Got the Bibimbap with Kalbi for $15.99 - ribs were really fatty
Also got the fried ramen with rice cake for $9.99 - it was very salty and got boring after a few bites. Since this is the closest Korean restaurant to where I live, I would only come back if I was lazy to travel and was really craving Korean food.

2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Food was quite underwhelming in flavor. The jjajangmyeon, kimchi jiggae and japchae had no taste. I wanted to like it but unfortunately it wasn't so."}
{"text":"this place is expensive and terrible Korean food. it does not taste like authentic Korean food! the four side dishes they give you taste awful and are not comparable to the variety of side dishes that other places give you. service was slow-only one waitress was working. 
the dish I ordered was stir fried pork with veggies - warning do not get this! it taste like poorly made Chinese food with tons of msg. way to salty and the pork was too chewy.
skip this place next time you want Korean food!  there are many other places that offer real Korean food with a good variety of side dishes and food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Food here is great. I never ate in but also took take out and thought the food was amazing. They prepared everything quickly. I have no compliants here"}
{"text":"The person who helped us was very nice. Appetizer dishes included kimchi, bean sprouts, glass noodles, potatoes, and soybeans. The bean sprouts were very clean and fresh tasting. The texture of the potato was very uniform and had a hint of sweetness. We ordered L2 and L4 which is ramen with rice cakes, and rice cakes with chicken. The rice cakes are the long cylindrical kind and were amazing. The chicken was marinated perfectly, and cooked perfectly. We asked for seconds of bean sprouts, potato, and glass noodles and she brought them over real quick. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Ever since the owner changed the food does not taste the same.  The flavour does not pack a punch and the quality is not impressive.  I would rather to go owl."}
{"text":"It's nice that it's a Korean option in Scarborough (there aren't very many at all around here) but they have pages and pages of dishes which makes it more likely to pick a dish they're not particularly good at making.

If you do come here, indeed the park bone soup is okay and you'll be safe ordering that. I tried the ramen rice cake (it's flavour was very off- it was really really salty, but is supposed to have a sweet taste) and the seafood pancake (which was also pretty bad). 

Anyway it wasn't worth it, think the total came to around 40 for 2 people (pork bone soup + ramen rice cake + seafood pancake) and we didn't want to take it to go. 

Probably won't come back unless I'm dying for pork bone soup and am very unwilling to drive an extra 15 min"}
{"text":"I was reeeeeeally craving don katsu, and didn't want to drive far.

Opened up Yelp and this is what I got. A 5minute drive to satisfy my craving. Small place, watch your step before you enter. 

The katsu was exactly what I wanted, and the side salad was yummy. My bfs noodles were verrrrrrry bland, and the kimchi lacked flavour on all fronts. 

This pace also offered sushi, but we didn't try any.  Would've been nice if they had bento boxes with the Don katsu. 

Probably won't return, unless craving katsu again."}
{"text":"My repeat visit to In Cheon turns out to be excellent!!

The staffs are much more attentive and friendly.

And thanks for fellow yelper recommendations, I really enjoy my C3  -  Incheon House Kal Guk Soo($7.95) - Special Food Category. Noodles has such great texture and bite, great portions and yummy!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was mediocre. Once they get your orders, the waitress will rarely check up on you to see what you need. Sometimes, it's very hard to get their attention too, so I consistently had to put my hand up for them to notice. 

Their side dishes isn't my favourite either. Their kimchi tastes a little dry and different from what I'm used to. 

The food itself is good. The pork bone soup is my favourite, and I usually get deep fried dumplings."}
{"text":"Depending on the dish you get, your opinion of this restaurant changes. Some dishes have good portions and are really filling, while some dishes are really lacking in size. The side dishes they give are average, and so is service.

Incheon House provides both Korean and Japanese food, and the quality of each dish changes depending on your order. It really is a place where you have to try a bunch of different things in order to figure out what's good. Pork bone soup is usually consistently decent, if you're wondering what to eat. The salmon lover's maki is also filled with salmon pieces and can be very filling, but it is only available after 1PM as of late. 

I wouldn't seek this place out, but I would return."}
{"text":"i came to this place because i wasnt feeling for OWL, i wanted to try a different korean restaurant and it was already very late. 

when i saw the menu, i instantly regretted my decision.  

Its definitely on the pricey side for a typical restaurant.   Im okay with that if their food justifies the price.  But the problem is it doesnt.

1. crappy sides
2. portions are small (especially the side dishes.. i provided a pic)  
3. i left hungry
4. pricey

bottom line.. it was a one time thing.. i would not come back here."}
{"text":"They have pork bone soup with instant noodles! The only place I know that combines two of my favourites in one.  This would be how I describe happiness in a bowl.  It's a great meal on a cold day or a long day of snowboarding and you're just come back in to town and hungry."}
