{"text":"Food was good (see previous review about the meatball focus). However, the service was quite disorganized. We sat ourselves and waited for a while for our first greeting. We grabbed menus from a nearby table waiting to be bussed. Eventually we had to flag down the duty manger and got a server assigned. Food took a tad long but not excessively slow. Our server misheard our refill order and we had to sent back the alcoholic drinks.   We believe that the place has only been open for a month or two. There seem to be sufficient servers but we can only speculate that they are still getting organized....after a month.   Otherwise, the place is clean and recently renovated and most staff seem friendly. Best to bring your patience."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and efficient. Typical bar menu + lots of meatballs. Nachos were ok, not terrible not great. Beer was exceptionally cold. A bit tricky to navigate front steps. There are only a few but there's no handrail so those with mobility issues should be aware. I hope that management will consider installing handrails. I didn't see an alternate entrance so I'm not sure if it is wheelchair accessible. Best to call ahead."}
{"text":"We just popped in off the street without having read any reviews.  The rooftop patio was of definite appeal.  Thankfully it was an overcast day in July as we could see no evidence of umbrellas or shaded area for those that need to get out of the sun.  Place was very quiet for the 12 - 1 lunch hour with only three tables occupied.  The lower floor was also practically empty.  Another red flag at lunch hour.   Our waitress was friendly and tried her best to be helpful, but had to go to great lengths to try to explain how the Menu works and admitted that management is working on a new menu as these are very confusing.  Duh?  For a restaurant that only serves \"MEATBALLS\" it is hard to understand how management could come up with a confusing menu, but they did! When orders were served with all plates entrees being meatballs, the only way we could identify our orders was by the side dish.  Halfway through we realized that the kitchen had mixed up the orders & sides?    Trying to eat a round meatball loaded with juicy sauce inside a  baguette takes great skill not to have a total mess.    After the fact, reading the reviews it is surprising to see ++ reviews until you read them and learn they are from Meatball lovers.    For someone to open a restaurant serving only 1 type of entree sure looks like a menu for bankruptcy and closure.     Meatball lovers enjoy, but I will not be back."}
{"text":"Hope you like balls. This is a meatball place so the ball jokes here are endless. My favourite was that the men and womans washrooms were labelled \"Balls\" and \"No Balls\" respectively.   Joking aside, we had a wonderful, reasonbly priced lunch on the patio! This building used to be Molly Malones and I believe it's one of the best rooftop patios in the city. The perfect place for an afternoon margarita. I tried the peach margarita and it was so tasty and refreshing. Our server was fantastic - very attentive.   I ordered 3 meatball sliders (classic, chicken and veggie), the Caprese salad, and a side of fries to share with a friend. The meatball sliders were great. They came on a toasted bun with fried onions and each had a different sauce. My favourite was the Classic (beef with tomatoe sauce) but the cheese sauce on the chicken meatball was super yummy. The veggie and pesto meatball had good flavour but had a potato-y consistency that felt was a bit too much carbs with the slider bun. The Caprese salad was great but maybe a little over priced ($12) for the amount you get. The side of fries though!! They were perfectly cooked and drizzled in aioli with a sprinkle of parsley - AMAZEBALLS!   Overall, it's a great spot with some mighty tasty balls."}
{"text":"I sense a new neighbourhood gem! Looking forward to seeing how they develop things in the month to come but I was happy with my first visit this weekend. The meatball themed menu is fun, comforting, and priced right. Most of our table ordered the meatball sub, which comes with 3 balls (classic beef, pork, chicken or veggie, which is cheese, potato and spinach) Ina baguette with choice of sauce and an add-on like roasted peppers, plus fries with some aioli over top. Our table agreed: they picked a simple food concept and executed it well. The only tweak I'd suggest is that the bun to ball ratio be adjusted. There's just too much bun for those 3 balls. Nbd. Other tables around us tried the salads which looked well-sized and might be worth a try.  They've got a variety of cocktails on the menu. The smoked old fashioned and monitors went over well and I enjoyed my blended Pimms-cicle. (I think they blend their slushy drinks to order.) The patio isn't much changed from Molly's and I hope they add some umbrellas to make this into a go-to patio for the 'hood. The interior downstairs looks great with its lighter, classier update over the previous pub. Keep it up Prohibition!"}
