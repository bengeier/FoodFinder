{"text":"Loved the Greek Fries! Thanks to the owner for recommending.  Gyros good too.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've only tried the chicken shawarma gyro so far, but I'm looking forward to going back! The restaurant was clean and cheerful and the staff was very sweet, plus my gyro was everything I was looking for!"}
{"text":"Food here iz quite fresh and yummy.  If u are a kabobs or shawarma fan,  u have to try this place.. All d meats we try(lamb,  chicken)  everything tasted very fresh.."}
{"text":"A really great place to stop and get a bite to eat!  Friendly service and decent portions!  Try the desserts!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The owners are just the nicest people you'll ever meet and the food is consistently amazing! I always order the gyros or gyro pizza, and my fianc√©e gets the chicken shawarma, but everything we've ever had there is delicious! Try their unique gyro pizza or even their Chicago dogs! And don't forget to order baklava!!"}
{"text":"So I joined Yelp, just to write this review.  Yes, owners, I'm the person who you saw sitting in the truck with my significant other eating your food when you showed up at 830 tonight.  Even eating in our truck, we were done by 843 and out of there.  Since we got there at 8:10, it is a little odd to be told we'd have to get it to go, as it was 20 min before closing but we were hungry and had a hankering for greek.   There was no black, unsweetened tea available.  Our drink cups weren't given to us until we asked anyway.  The gal working the counter was pleasant and friendly. The gyro meat is good.  tzatziki a little bland.  Did you know that rather than breaking your customer's teeth, that kalamata olives come (mostly) pitted in jars at Costco? (for the record, I scooped the first olive, not stabbed, or I'd have noticed the pit.)  I also didn't need the base of a head of romaine thrown in to my salad either. The dressing was good, and my significant other says his gyro was okay, with a good soft, pita.  Being that we were visiting from the west side of town, there's no way the food would have lasted the hour drive home.  I haven't tried the baklava yet, but that will make it home, and my teeth hurt. All in all, I think we'll stick to Opa Life when visiting the east side."}
{"text":"My wife and I both ordered a \"Greek Gyro\". I chose fries for the side, she chose salad. We also bought a side of hummus.  The fries and the pitas were warm and fresh. Unfortunately, this is the best we can say. The fries were dusted with stale parmesan and not salted. The salad was a mix of iceberg and butter lettuce. The gyro meat wasn't bad, just, mediocre. Worse was the watery, flavourless hummus.  Less important, but still off-putting, were the cheap paper plates and the tacky hand-written sign next to the soda fountain insisting \"Only 1 refill\".  \"Bland\" sums up our experience."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise!! I stopped here on a whim, really hungry and not wanting to order fast food through a drive-thru. The staff was super friendly and accommodating even though I ordered for take-away.   The price point is just right. I ordered the falafel pita with fries, as well as baklava. I took a bite of the baklava while I waited and it was delicious even though it was not fresh or made in-house.  I drove home to eat the food and was immediately surprised at how awesome it was. Probably the best falafel I've had in the valley. They kindly put the taziki sauce in a small container so the sandwich wouldn't be soggy by the time I got home. They also did not put a million pounds of iceberg lettuce on it, like other places do. The fries were still very hot and seasoned just right!  There is ZERO curb appeal and the layout is awkward, but don't let that stop you from going in. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"this is the best restaurant in arizona!!!  i love this place, the food is amazing.....  the gyro's are soooooooooooo good its tender and juice... great gyro meat, the sauce is the best sauce. they even have mouth watering italian beef with cheese omg... so good.  now they are making some delicious pizza... imagine gyro pizza.... the best of both worlds they have gyro pizza.... it's the best place.... the customer service is so great. they treat the customers like family. they're very warm and loving....  if you are in mesa,az make sure you stop here. trust me you will be so happy you did, i know i am.   gyro house mesa is my favorite place to get great food,  good conversation and many happy memories with my loved ones."}
{"text":"We ate there recently and had wonderful friendly service. The food was generous and delicious. We will certainly be back for more."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. The lady at the counter is not welcoming. It seemed like a bother for her to take our order both times. The falafel pita, dolmas and fish were excellent though. It's a very open and bright restaurant. We didn't like the hummus here. It had something pink on top of it and tasted very odd."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The food presented on the plate at the table was the same as the Yelp reviews for menus online aesthetically pleasing and fantastic and taste thank you"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and really enjoyed it! I got the Italian beef pita and my husband got the fries with gyro meat. Both really good! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the gentleman owner was most helpful & kind.  Tabouli was terrific (so fresh) as well as the gyro sandwich.  Also, the sampler platter was large & tasty.  And, it's so healthy too."}
{"text":"Well, I'm here sitting and waiting at the gyro house!!!! It's 7:20 now-- I came in at 7 and ordered a couple of items, plus their special which was on the board, the salmon platter.... cashier comes out after 15 minutes and tells me that he wasn't told that they were out of salmon... first-- he tells me to order something else to replace it and he wont charge tax; i told him that i already paid the tax (he's making me think that he was doing me a favor) for the initial order... secondly, he tells me that its another 10 to 15 minute wait... lastly; its 7:25 now and they have not even erased the board that offers the special.. for the hassle of all these, not even to offer you anything to compensate for their screw up!!! Not that i would take it... but the point is--- when the owners were running this place, i never had one problem or should i say it was managed better... as i am writing this, at 7:30 now without my food yet, cashier is out having a smoke break... Finally got my food, and were presented coupons for next visit.. just refused it and left... ive always driven out here for their food although its a far drive, but not coming back anymore!!!  To continue, came home and ate.  Pizza is still really good, but the rest of my order is not at all good.. I got the Mix plate kabob.. rice was soggy and not the regular that I normally get."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service there today. Waited for 35mins for our simple order of 2 original gyro pitas with fries. With someone who came in 10mins after us and got her to go order still 15mins before we had our food. With the only explanation that the girl taking the orders said she messed up something. But the read out on our receipt was accurate, so that didn't make sense.  The worse part was that no manager came to apologize or try to make the dining experience any better. Sad for a place that could be a good Mediterranean place."}
{"text":"Been to the Gyro House several times now and have had a very good experience every time.  So far each time I've gotten the Beef and Lamb Gyro special which includes a soft drink and fries.  The gyro meat is soft and tender, and the tzatziki, onion and tomato taste fresh and good.  The pita bread is soft, warm and really tasty.  The fries seem to be made from whole potatoes and are always fried just right...rather than those Frankenstein potato bits you see if you break most fast-food fries open.  The owners are friendly and now that I've been in a few times they've started to recognize me which is nice.  When I complimented the older gentleman/owner on their food on my last visit he said they buy only the best ingredients...and based on my experience there, I believe him.   The decor is not fancy...just tables and booths...but what keeps me coming back is simply the good food.  I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro platter as take out on my way home from work. I had to wait what I thought was a pretty reasonable amount of time. The meat was ok. But the rice... Amazing. It was yellow, fluffy and I think I tasted a hint of mint in the mix of flavor? I was going to save some for later because I got so much, but ended up finishing it 10 minutes later.  It's the food-related details that make this a place to support. The fresh-tasting red onion and tzatziki (and the warm flatbread) were an excellent compliment to the meat, which, again, was just ok. The fries were well-seasoned and well-cooked (and there were plenty of them.) I will probably try the salad next time, though, because fries overall don't really travel well.  On a whim, I decided to try a piece of the baklava. It's a better price than I had seen around. Trying to cut into it with a fork had me a bit worried; it was a bit tough. The taste, however, was GREAT. Just the right amount if sweet to finish off a dinner. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Very good food gyro was perfect. I ordered a philly cheesesteak for my hubby (thinks he doesn't like greek) also good but came on a pita. Will Def be a regular here!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and caring owners, very nuce people and they love what they do the food is worth going back for."}
{"text":"This place has, by far, the best gyros in Arizona. I've had every other gyros available in Arizona, from the Rex Allen cowboy gyros in Willcox to the Hoover dam gyros, from territorial prison gyros in Yuma to the Indian fry bread gyros at Four Corners. And the gyros at the Gyro House in Mesa, are absolutely the best. The genuine friendliness of our server, Allison, was an added bonus to the excellent food. We will return here several times."}
{"text":"Had the Gyro with a Greek salad, humus, and some dolmas.  Yum!  Pita bread was very soft and warm.  Salad was fresh.  And he said the dolmas were homemade and they tasted very good.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome ....I used to drive by on my way home from work one day I decided to stop by and try a gyro since I LOVE gyros so much I was plesently surprise of the quality and service of this place. If they had more than 5 starts I would of given them more!!! Keep up the good work and I will make sure to tell my friends about it"}
{"text":"Love those gyros. Tried a lot of gyro places around Mesa, and these guys do them well. Not too complicated and not too simple, just Gyros. Lots of other choices in the menu. I  recommend they create a naan bread option for the bigger appetitees like me."}
{"text":"Came in with high hopes, the ordering was great and the guy was courteous but when the food came I noticed that their pizza is not fresh, it's store bought then a bit more cheese added then heated, the gyro meat : beef and the chicken were cold to the touch. I went and told the person who we ordered from, he apologized and said he will bring some hot meat to the table. He never did. Will not be back to this establishment."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place for gyros - our office staff were regulars. New ownership and cooks 4 months ago.  No longer using their STELLAR pizza crust - now some gummy stuff, probably gluten (and taste) free.  Mistakenly put tomato sauce on gyro pizza a couple of weeks ago - really awful with tzaziki (sp).   We've tried twice recently - got 3 different items, all fell far short of \"old\" items.  Won't go again - they ruined a great 'find'."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great food, clean and very nice staff! Gyro is my personal favorite, just the perfect amount of meat, the cucumber sauce is to die for! We have also ordered the sampler which is enough to feed six people! Don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service. Ist being told a week ago 35mins before closing that we had to order our food to go. Then I hear the lady on the phone tonight telling someone that the kitchen closes at 8:30. Business hours are until 9pm. After our food was delivered to our table, and we had already started eating, the hyper woman working there comes over to our table and says that is not what you ordered! And precedes to tell us what we ordered. I explained that it was close, just figured the rice came with it, since that was the only mistake on the plate. She was extremely rude, and confrontational. We will never eat at this restaurant again. People don't go into a restaurant and spend $19 for two sandwiches to be treated that way. The food isn't that good, the service was terrible, it was filthy, almost all the tables were filthy, no thank you and way too expensive!  Pita Jungle is 100% better!!!!"}
{"text":"We were craving gyros and my mentioned this place and I am glad she did! We got some gyros and Greek fries and they were excellent!  I only wish was that the fries had the lemon sauce like some others Greek places have but still excellent! Everything was fresh, the meat was thinly sliced just the way we like it!  We will be back! Yum!"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and decided to try the house special pita. It was a super delicious combo of chicken shawarma and gyro meat!! Very tender and full of flavor, especially with the yogurt sauce. They are very friendly and went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of.  This is definitely my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"As far as Gyro and Pita places go, this place is awesome. Great tzatziki that's always cold on top of tons of meat. Arby's doesn't have the meats...this place does!"}
{"text":"I like this place  due to the fact that they have Pizza Gyro  and it was super good. Lol. It was our first time here and my wife loved their food.  Place is pretty big and cozy. We'll definitely coming back next time. This may be our Greek spot to go to to."}
{"text":"By far the best food I've ever had in my entire 21 years of life. I ordered the chicken schawamra and it came with a Greek salad , a pita bread sliced into two halves ,tasty marrinated chicken and beautifuly flavored rice . There was a cucumber sauce for the  salad . I don't understand why more people aren't talking about Greek food because oh my God . I will definitely be back there."}
{"text":"Love this place not only is everything hot and fresh, but the owners and workers are amazing. I really can't say enough about this place. I am a lover of gyros and this place is my all time favorite!!"}
{"text":"Great gyros! And that means a lot because there are several places out there that don't make good gyros.I really love the owner too, he is so sweet and always makes us feel welcome. If you want true authentic Greek food come here!"}
{"text":"This place is magical. What food should taste like. This is the third time I have eaten here for lunch and I cannot stop talking about how good it is. My entire office is addicted to their food.  Do yourself a favor .."}
{"text":"I've lived in AZ over 20 years and haven't been able to find a gyro to match my favorite place in IL.... Until today. Tried the gyro pita with fries, gyro plate, and gyro pizza. All were phenomenal. Will definitely be back. Decent prices, friendly staff."}
{"text":"What a joke and an insult to authenticity.  With that said, if you want to alienate customers then keep having your bad attitude. BTW, clean the tables fgs!"}
{"text":"Ordered the gyro salad! Big portion size! Great food and very welcoming service! Will return!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Great service, food is awesome and hot when served. Clean & prices are great."}
{"text":"I come here a lot and I told  all my friends and coworkers about this place but I think yesterday was my last time. The owners are super friendly and the food is good too but it used to be better and a lot more I don't think you get enough for what you pay."}
{"text":"Get ready to be surprised. From the outside this looks like the average strip mall gyro place. It only takes one look at the menu to realize there is so much more. We were greeted by the very friendly owner at the front counter. There is a full menu of greek dishes on a well designed menu board behind the counter. The options will surprise you. I ordered the chicken shwarma platter and my girlfriend had the salmon platter. Both dishes were served with ample sides of rice and a greek salad. The meals arrived at our table hot after what felt like a slightly prolonged wait. It was explained that the salmon is prepared to order and takes a little extra time. With this in mind the wait was not excessive.  The chicken shwarma had the slow cooked flavor and texture one should expect. The pita bread was warm and soft. The salmon was fully cooked but not dry and lightly seasoned. The salads were properly dressed and the rice was tender and flavorful. The tzatziki sauce was cool, light, and well balanced. one of the better ones I have had. This is a must go to place for a change of pace if you're in the area.  Warm Fuzzies (the good stuff) -well displayed and diverse menu. -friendly staff and owners. -clean cozy dining room, even if it is a little small. -food is well seasoned and the seasoning compliments the flavor of the food, not covers it. -generous portions.  Cold Baldies (the not so good stuff) -tablet based register system that pushes for tips at the time you order, not the type of place that you expect to be leaving a tip. -tables would look better in a Japanese restaurant, not a Greek place. -stingy with sauces, charge for extra."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food. Sometimes it takes a while for a to go order even when calling ahead but it's still worth the wait. The gyro pizza is solid."}
{"text":"I would normally give this place a 5, but not this time.  not sure if there new owners, but prices raised and sandwiches are smaller.  ???  called in an order on wed. Sue told me it would be about 20 min.  So I waited just about 20 min, since I only live 5 min away.  Arrived.  I count 9 people waiting and looking very hangry.  so I wait, wait, another 15 min in the lobby for my food.  get home, the tzatiki totally changed... not very good and my gyro was small and my husband philly cheese was VERY tiny.... but they were sure to give way too many fries with this dish. I would have preferred a small portion of fries and a bigger sandwich.  Tomatoes had to be pulled of sandwich, cause they were green and onions... barely could find any and I asked for extra.  won't be back for awhile. hope they get it together.. ."}
{"text":"So good perfect service call ahead for sure they do get busy i would recommend that they should offer a stamp card for Continuous visitor like me."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is delicious and the service is excellent. We tried it on a whim and we are so glad we did because we will definitely be back. The food alone makes us want to go back but the service just put our experience over the top!  We did a three meat plate and got the gyro, chicken kabob, and beef kufta. All were delicious and I can't stop thinking about the chicken.   We tried the falafel as well as the hummus and both were excellent. Some of the best hummus I've ever had."}
{"text":"Had another great meal tonight! The Beef Kabobs were so tender it melted in your mouth! My husband gets the pepperoni pizza and loves it! With such a great menu its my go to restaurant several times a week...."}
{"text":"Just had my first meal at this restaurant last week with my mother-in-law. Everything about the experience makes me want to go back again.  You order at the front counter then go seat yourself. The service was outstanding.  The wait was rather long, but we hadn't noticed because we were visiting. The owner of the establishment noticed though, and she brought us out some free baklava and apologized profusely. Incredibly nice lady!  Mom and I like to sample several things and share them.  The Greek salad was one of the best I've had.  The sampler of dolmas, falafel, two hummuses and babaganoush were all very tasty...  And finally, we enjoyed some deep fried mushrooms 'cause sometimes you just need some.  Portions are sensible to large.  We bought extra baklava to go... SO good because it's flakey with just the right amount of honey.  A little chewy on the corners...  Mmmmm.  I get the feeling that they are very family-like with their customers and enjoy their regulars a great deal. I may become one of them. Their pizzas look fabulous...maybe that's dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been 5 times and every time has been great! The gyro with feta cheese is my favorite. They also have great hummus and baklava. And the owner is very nice!"}
{"text":"I love this place even more now. I ordered the wrong veggie pita and they fixed it for me!!!!!!  I had been dying for the grilled veggie pita and I hadn't had it in at least a month.  I guess they also have a veggie pita that is more like a salad pita with hummus.  I ordered the latter without realizing my mistake.  The owner brought it over to my table (that's right, the owners literally bring your food out to you) and when he realized my mistake, without hesitation, said he would fix it.  He made my day!  The pita was as delicious as ever!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek food joint by far. Excellent friendly service. Very clean restaurant and bathroom. Conservatively and nicely decorated interior. Speed of service, value, and menu selection outstanding.  I usually get the original gyro platter or the chicken cabob platter. Both are phenomenal.  Best food around.   Keep up the good work gyro house."}
{"text":"Tried Gyro House for the first time today.  I really liked it and will be back.  I had a  gyro it was very good with salad which was  also very good.  I also tried the falafel which I loved.  The restaurant is clean. That is a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Very friendly and great service! The place was clean and the girl talking our order was so nice!  The food was really good and it tasted freshly made! We had two chicken shwarmas, ($7.99 each) and they came with crispy fries! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We drove 2 hours to find this place and amazing I must say definitely say amazing.... Food amazing service and quality on the top. Keep up great work"}
{"text":"Wow so good - the owner is so nice. He really cared what I thought about the food. Everything was so fresh delicious. Support this place."}
{"text":"First time here. Probably won't be back. I had the Gyro platter with rice & Greek salad. The salad was dripping in  oil & was missing the vinegar part. Some places I've been to shave the gyro meat then slap it on the cooktop for a few minutes to warm it a bit more. Not here. They shaved it & plopped it on the plate, so it was a bit on the cool side. Bleh!! The tzatziki sauce was good! My husband got beef kabob, chicken shawarma, grilled veggies & rice. He said the chicken shawarma was good, but the beef was yucky & gummy. His veggies were dripping in oil also."}
{"text":"Very good food.  First time there and will definitely return.  Gyro meet melted in our mouths and the pita bread was warm & fresh.  The people there were very cordial and welcoming.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"awesome shawarma chicken pizza!!! and shawarma chicken platter and shawarma beef pita!!! LOVE THEIR FOOD!!!  and the service is great! The owners are super nice & their food is always fresh & delicious!!!! Our whole family loves eating at this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Passed by and went there for lunch. I had a Gyro meat salad and my wife had a chicken plate. The food was very fresh, service was friendly and efficient and we would eat there again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Good food and fast friendly service! They have great dolmades and falafel. The restaurant is always clean. The hummus was a bit on the dry bland side this last visit but usually it is very tasty."}
{"text":"This place absolutely kills it every time! Their gyros are nothing short of spectacular as well as their customer service! Whether you decide to eat in or take out you can expect professionalism in all aspects of the experience. The owners are super friendly and you can tell they are hard workers. 5/5 every time."}
{"text":"Ordered from door dash had delivered to my work. The Hummus was good tasted fresh, I ordered the Gyro pizza it was great."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have tried several things. Everything was good.  The chicken shwarama and gyros are my favorites."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Got the traditional Gyro with fries. Gyro was packed full of meat and onions and the tzatziki sauce was excellent. I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend and had some amazing food!  Service was courteous and quick.  I had the Gyro, which had great tasting Tzatziki sauce and fresh ingredients, and my friend had the chicken Schwarma and said it was so, so tasty.  We both agreed that the french fries were amazing with the ranch sauce we asked for....Prices were very reasonable and will definitely stop back and try the pizza!!  Owners are so friendly and nice - will definitely be stopping back again soon.  Conveniently located on the Southeast corner of Southern & Val Vista - a great restaurant to have in the neighborhood!  My new 'go to' place for awesome food!"}
{"text":"Good food with good prices. The place is clean and the front counter is generally nice"}
{"text":"Great food, prices are average for this type of food and a really nice selection. Only thing I would suggest, try flipping the baklava every couple of days to keep the top half moist. Ours was very dry on top."}
{"text":"Very good. I had the hummus sampler. Two kinds of hummus, baba ganouj, dolmas, and falafels. My son had the Shawarma pizza but modified it so much it was practically a new creation. The owner was very accommodating to this and we were grateful for it. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our family frequent The Gyro House a few times a month, and we have had nothing but excellent food and service.  Husband orders the Gyro Meal with fries and drink.  I order the chicken gyro meal with Greek salad and a drink.  The chicken is always flavorful and the pita is stuffed full of chicken and crisp veggies.  I order mine with extra sauce!   We always order the hamburger meal for my daughter and the hamburger is always nicely cooked and the fries are hot and tasty.   The restaurant is run by a very nice Greek gentleman who makes every customer feel like an old friend.  The lady who works in the kitchen is always quick with a hello while running back and forth between being cook and server.  The restaurant is always clean.  The owner brings samples of their soup to the table, I highly recommend the Northern Bean soup, delicious. In final, the Gyro House is excellent, well priced food.  The service is impeccable and so very friendly.  Any wait you experience is due to your food being made to order, so be glad it's not quick.  In this case, it is because they are taking great care to make your food SUPBERB!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get your Mediterranean cravings satisfied.  They have great portions and good food.  This place is extremely busy at lunch.  The owners are super friendly.  Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Great food! This is a go and order then sit down restaurant... the quality of the food was far superior to what we were expecting. Derek, who took our order is one of the reasons we would come back again. He was very informative and took his time trying to help us with our choices."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is really good. I always get the gyro. The salad is great. Hummus is ok. Pitas are warm and delicious. It is small, sort of mom and pop. Yummy!"}
{"text":"July 2015 They still are updating their look and now are serving some Greek style pizzas. I love looking at my past reviews and seeing the growing faithful customer base that this restaurant is receiving. There is a gentleman there now who mainly takes care of the place and he has some great customer service with always a smile. Gyros and fries are still one of the best here!  ---- August 2014 We still think this is the best gyro place in the valley.  The other one on Baseline has drier meat.    What I love about this place is that you can somewhat peek in the kitchen and you'll see them hand cut their chicken and also even peel their vegetables.  You can taste the quality in their food as well.  They are slowly updating their look and service as you can see below.  Prices haven't increased but they are getting more and more customers which is what they deserve.  I did make a comment how the owners aren't there as much (they are a cute older couple) yet the experience with one of the ladies at the register was awesome.  I stated that I was on a ver low carb diet and she recommended how to modify my meal to accommodate that.  I was just really impressed with the above and beyond service that they provided.  Great food!  -------------- February 2013 Currently my wife and I think it's the best place for gyros in the valley. Trust is we tried them all. Unfortunately the ones that we like eventually shut down and so I really hope that this doesn't happen here as well so help out yelpers!  First you will always see the owners here and are here with a smile and willing to serve. (Edit: not as much anymore)  We always order the gyro plate with fries. This comes with a drink as well. The fries are amazing. It's not just your typical frozen fries but they season then as well. There is plenty of meat in the gyro pitas and is cooked perfectly.   One thing that's annoying is their \"one refill\" policy...that's ridiculous. (Edit: Not there anymore)  Try it! If you have another gyro place to recommend let me know!"}
{"text":"Always friendly service when I go. Their stuffed grape leaves are delicious. Lemony, hearty, just perfect. It's a great little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great food! I've dined in as well as ordered take-out and their chicken shwarma platter, pitas, and salads are delicious! Will definitely dine in or order from here again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Good affordable meal. My family enjoys the kafta pita, hummus and chicken pitas. The rice is full of flavor. The individual pizzas are good for the kids. Overall great meal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have taken food home from that place twice already!  Both times, everything has been great!!  The food is amazing; in large portions, and priced right!  I think not only is it important that the quality of the food, but the owners are nice!!  I highly recommend this place!  Nothing there gets boring!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is omg wow this place... is def rocking lemme tell ya I have a very matured pallet and I am a very big foodie this very clean their service is 2nd to none and the food... WOW the food is #amazing  Like seriously I'm Greek and this food reminds me of home and my grandmothers cooking (lamb) nothing more satisfying than eating gourmet restaurant that is very clean when I'm not here I crave it and when I'm full I can't wait to be hungry again so I can come back! With my children and pets my dog morty loves the leftovers lemme tell ya haha but yeah definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I have been coming here for the past year and have never had a bad experience! Love it!!"}
{"text":"My favorite food ever!!! They updated the menu boards and the food is amazing!! They do gluten free food too!!"}
{"text":"I have always had Great food and service here but it was very poor form for them to be open on Postmates, accept orders, and then cancel them because they are too busy over a holiday weekend. What did they expect it? And then to not answer the phoneSo that we could place an order for pick up."}
{"text":"Gyro House is that place to eat when you're craving some real quality food at lower prices. The meat is freshly cooked and the fries are on point. My particular favorite is the Chicken Shawarma Pizza -- a personal sized pizza is enough to fill you up for lunch and leave a snack for two hours later. They deliver through doordash, postmates - you name it. The management is friendly and makes sure you are satisfied. I've ordered several times from this place while studying and have introduced all my friends to it -needless to say, this is one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with coworkers for lunch.  The employees are always friendly and the food is out quickly.  I've tried the chicken gyro, the lamb/beef gyro, the hummus and french fries.  Everything is so delicious!  I also love that they have shaded outdoor seating since the weather has been so pleasant lately."}
{"text":"This place rocks! We've been to so many gyro places around town and non compare to the Gyro House. This is our go to for a great Chicken Shawarma Pita or even some of there creative Greek inspired pizzas! This is one you've got to check out!... Owners are super friendly too!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to's for take out. It's so freaking good. My personal favorite order is Greek fries, extra crispy, with Gyro meet. But seriously, anything you get here is good. I'm so happy it is less than a mile from my house on my way home from work.Plus, the staff are just the best! Thanks Angela and Sue!"}
{"text":"Great food, and wonderful owner.  There is a lot of pride that goes into the food here.  I had a lamb gyro, and was still hungry afterwards so I ordered a Chicken Gyro to go.  This is the best $10 I've spent in a really long time.  Authentic Greek flavors at really great prices.  From now on, when I find myself near Dana Park, I'll skip the fancy mall and come here instead."}
{"text":"Defitnely the best gyros we've had since moving to AZ. Everything we ordered came out fresh and hot. The gyro bites are a must try. The lady working was friendly. Just wish they were closer to my side of town."}
{"text":"I went back last week to dine. Called in my regular order. Was a little surprised to see the register used that iPad technology where you had to swipe your card for POS. I was signing my name when the gentleman at the register asked me five times to \"fill out the top\" before I sign. What he meant was fill out the tip portion. Thought that was kind of strange but whatever, guess he wanted his tip. My husband and I came home to discover the food portions changed. My entree salad with gyro meat is now less than half a take out portion. Just lettuce, dressing, three slices of tomato and meat. No olives, feta or banana peppers on this salad. Our portion of hummus was bigger than my entree salad and they only gave us 1 pita to eat it with. Not sure if this place is under new management but whatever changes isn't for the best. Food is average at best."}
{"text":"Much better Greek places in the vicinity that are worth the extra few miles. The service was prompt and courteous but that only does so much if your food isn't great! I got the chicken gyro with fries. The chicken was extremely dry with little flavor and only came with a small amount of sauce. The fries seemed a bit undercooked but I did enjoy the Parmesan dusting. I may return again to give them a second chance but wouldn't recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been here about a handful of times. I always get the gyro so I am unable to comment on their other meals. This is a compliment to the Gyro House because their gyros are so good I haven't tired of them. The meat is well seasoned, juicy and plentiful.   I can also comment on their side salad and falafel because I get them to compliment the gyro. The side salad comes as an included option with the gyro meal (along with a drink.) When I'm with others I buy the falafel as an appetizer. The salad is made of the good cuts of lettuce (not the average crappy oversized chunks of iceberg lettuce I get at many other restaurants.) It includes peppers, onion, tomato, cucumber and some kind of homemade oil and herb dressing. Awesome! The falafel is also homemade (not made from a mix like with many of their competitors.) This gives it a unique taste and freshness.  The service is very friendly, professional and accommodating and for all this quality the prices are very reasonable.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We love this place!!  Excellent gyros and portions are HUGE !  The restaurant is clean and the people are so friendly and nice.  We've been there several times it's a favorite of ours !"}
{"text":"Came for the first time today but it won't be the last time! The food was super tasty and the portions generous. Our food came very quickly and we were satisfied in every way. This is a very clean restaurant too. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for mediterranean food and having moved to AZ about a month ago I convinced my bf to go to this place and let me tell you he wasnt disappointed. We got the chicken swarma plate, beef gyro and a soda and spent about $20 which I think is reasonable since their swarma plate was big enough for both of us to share. We both like the food and they have a white sauce dont remember the name but has a cucumber taste to it it was delicious. We will definitely be back.   Cons/pro: the wait for our food was a bit longer than expected but didn't mind as the food tasted fresh and hot and let me tell you the PITA bread was fresh its like they had just taken it off the oven."}
{"text":"Greek/Turkish food is either great or ok, Gyro is great. I ordered Chicken Shawarma and Greek fries and could not finish it all. It was about $20 and was ordered to go. Chicken was well seasoned and sides were too Greek fries were delicious and had lots of feta. Service was quick and friendly and building was very clean. I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"The space, Sparce, with a counter for taking orders and some outdoor seating and indoor seating. A few obligatory tourist posters are on the wall, as well as a TV blaring Fox news at a slightly higher volume than I would like. Not ear splitting, but it was pretty loud.  But the main thing, is the food.  Sad to say, it was pretty run of the mill, and even though it's only their first week open, I'm still not holding out a lot of hope. I ordered a Gyro Plate and The Bride ordered a falafel plate. The gyro meat tasted like any I could have had at numerous food courts in any mall across the country. the cries were nice, and the pita bread was fresh. the one weird thing was that even though it came with a salad, and the salad had a little bit of feta (I forgot to ask for extra feta, since i love the stuff!) there was NO DRESSING on either of our salads, its almost as if.. well, greek salads didnt need dressing here or something, very odd.  My Brides Falafel was better, not much better than a boxed mix you can get at Fry's, but still a decent portion, and it tasted fine. Her hummus tasted fine, about the same as you can get at Costco, but with a bit more lemon than I like. (personal preference here) I might go back in a month or so and see how their Kabobs are, though the whole meal tasted rather pre-fab which breaks my heart. I was so looking forward to a good Mom and Pop gyro place close by.  The portions were nice though, and the people were friendly.  Perhaps given time they will improve. Currently they don't deliver, and to me, that's really their only hope for survival with so many apartments in the area. Hope others have better experiences!"}
{"text":"Is it me or instead of asking for suggestions \"someone\" who only has two reviews according to their profile, wants to write a review about how great their food was hours after a negative review?! Hmm??? As for my experience, I thought the Greek salad was a bit too salty. The rice was not authentic nor traditional, the Kabob was tasteless. I'm just going to have to stick with the best in the area, Haji Baba's.  I hate to write bad reviews however I need to let others know the truth. Honesty is still the best policy."}
{"text":"My friend and I come here regularly and we always like it. The owners are super friendly. I had the hummus and vegetables today they were delicious. My friend had the lamb and beef Gyro with french fries and it was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Owner personally takes care of you. Free wifi. Great place for fast, quality Greek food. I like the Chicken Shawarma Pita with fries which is a frequent lunch combo for $7.50. Having come here occasionally over many months I see the slow and steady improvements that have been made to the register, the menu screens, etc. Love this local place."}
{"text":"Excellent! This is by far the best Mediterranean restaurant I have been to. Clean, friendly, and family friendly."}
{"text":"So, I will admit that there is a sign when you walk in that says \"We are a made to order restaurant, not a fast food restaurant.\" That being said, I expected somewhat of a wait, but 45 minutes was just stupid. We ordered 2 gyros, 2 kids meals and a plate of hummus. This did not warrant that kind of wait. It appeared there was one person working the front of the restaurant and I can only assume by the speed of the service, one person working the back. The woman was friendly and apologized for the wait when she brought the food but a warning when we placed our order would have been appreciated. The guy in the back must have only been capable of one dish at a time. The food was tasty enough and the gyro was a decent portion. The people strewn about the restaurant waiting their 45 minutes for their food resembled the island of lost souls. I will drive further next time."}
{"text":"This is where I go for my gyros for now. Worker is pretty quick and attentive.   They have the Pita meal verse the plate meal.  Only difference is you get sides included with the plate.   Hummus on the side is extra.   I have only tried the chicken gyro.  Tasty, not too dry, and filling.  Inside the restaurant is pretty big and clean.   Prices is around $10 for the pita meal plus hummus plus salad on the side.  Would go again."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service, and clean restaurant.  Perfect place for us to grab lunch today, granted my kids got the usual kids meal stuff with pizza and chicken tenders they did dig into the baba ghanoush with happy grins."}
{"text":"The gyro is outstanding, the sauce is fresh and always has a generous amount of meat, onions and tomatoes in fluffy pita bread. The house salad on the side is my favorite part, TONS of veggies and the dressing is consistently fabulous! We've tried a lot of gyro places and have decided to not waste our time anywhere else. Calling an order in for pick up is also easy and they get your order perfect every time!"}
{"text":"I had been hoping to find a spot near my house, that could be my go to and sadly this place was not it. I gave it a 2 star rating because the place is clean and tidy but that was about the extent of it.   Pros: -Clean environment. All the furniture matches and the tables were relatively clean. -Lots of televisions on the walls, so you get some variety.  And now........  Cons: -Food doesn't at all resemble the menu. Think of McDonald's burgers - ad vs. reality. Same concept. My beef shawarma was a glob of meat that wasn't even cut into separate pieces, or maybe it was the inferior quality of the meat that made it too difficult to cut through. Either way, it was a task and don't get me started on the soggy rice. Last time I checked, Greek rice typically doesn't have vermicelli, although I know rice a roni sure does. My bf's beef kabob was jerky on a stick.  -The order taker, whose name I cannot recall although her name tag said she was the manager, needs to take a course in customer service. I know what it is like to have someone that you are friendly with show up to your job, but put your friend/boyfriend/husband in check when he feels the need to try and pressure the people ahead of him to hurry up so that he can have his turn. That's outright rude! To stand so close to someone in front of you, because you need to get your hillbilly self to the counter to flirt, is repulsive! I don't remember if his name was Paul or Peter, but you are lucky for MMJ because if not, your deliverance ass would have been on the floor!  ****Final note***** There is a sonic burger across the street, where it will not cost you $34 to buy 2 meals and two drinks. And your stomach will probably thank you for it later. The food is about as authentic as Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"It wasn't the best chicken schwarma I've had in the valley, but it was alright. Extremely friendly service and very reasonable prices. I would stop in again if I'm hungry and in the area.   The koi fish painted tables don't scream Mediterranean food, but whatever."}
{"text":"As a gyro lover I have to say YUMMY & TASTY! Over-stuffed, just the way I like'em! The only drawback here is that they keep it cold in their restaurant. Bring a jacket,"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Amazing food! Me and my girls friends from work come here on a weekly basis. John the owner is fantastic! We enjoy going in, he knows our orders, he is very personable it tops off the great food. The restaurant is always clean. I truly have never had a bad experience here!!"}
{"text":"I love Greek food and this place does a good job. The last time we tried this place it was slightly disappointing. They didn't provide us with any taziki sauce and no Greek dressing for her side salad. The meat was good and the rice was cooked well."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to have some lunch today and although we do not eat Mediterranean food very often a Gyro sounded good. When we ordered I asked for a good suggestion as I wasn't familiar with the menu. The lady at the register was so friendly and she offered her suggestion of Chicken Chill Fry. To make a long story short, IT WAS AMAZING!!!!!! Thank you Gyro House, my lunch experience was spectacular.  Oh yeah, my husband really enjoyed his house gyro and the hummus was fantastic also."}
{"text":"I love the Greek pizza. No meat just lots of yummy! Cucumber sauce on top, three cheeses, olives and more. Everything we've tried was good. Friendly people and service."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the people are wonderful. However the blonde manager was taking a to go order over the phone and was repeating someone's card number out loud and the entire restaurant could hear and so I would avoid takeout from this location."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place, having just moved to Gilbert and needing a new fav local. Went there last night full of hope. They had 2 tables or so eating in and 1 or 2 people waiting for pick up so not seeing an empty place..more hope. After placing our order it literally took forever. I think we waited 35 minutes, which is very long for 2 simple orders of 2x gyro wrap with fries and a side of onion rings.  However when food was finally done I still thought to myself \"if it's good a long wait is worth it\" Come home to put the food on plates and started eating only to realise why we had to wait so long as it was all over cooked/fried. Onion rings were rock hard - straight in the bin My chicken gyro...it was actually black on the sides that's how over cooked it was Fries - could have been nice but just fried too long. I could have lived with that if the rest was better. All in all super disappointed.   Edit:  Decided to give them a 2nd chance through doordash.  Pleasantly surprised. All tasted good. Will go a 3rd time and hopefully the 1st time bad experience was just a 1 time thing."}
{"text":"This my first review after trying this place for 2nd time. First experience was so so. So so food, small portions. Very confusing menu.   They have upgraded everything since then and the place looks very nice with better LCD TV menus and better take out menus. BUT the business ethics still sucks. I ordered kabobs and half my kabobs were raw. Asked the owner to fix it and the nexk kabob came half the size. I asked you to fix it, not shrink it. They also charge you for every little thing that is free at any other Gyro shop. They will ring up items such as Garlic paste, without even telling you. Something which is basically free at any other shop. Also be careful when ordering their specials. Again they will charge full price, until or unless you are paying attention. To me thats a very bad business practice."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I always get the kabobs with hummus and spicey hummus for sides. A tiny bit pricey but worth it. It's a local family owned business so I try to go here instead of the big chains."}
{"text":"Did take out for a company party and was complimented from everyone! Best gyro meat in town"}
{"text":"First time coming here. Thought it would be good based on the reviews. Unfortunately, the wait time was ridiculous. I ordered an original gyro and fries and a kids grilled cheese and fries. That's it! Waited almost an hour. At times it seemed like the entire restaurant was waiting for food. No one was eating! Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Very good food. My husband have been here 4 times in the past few months.  Its a mom and pop restaurant and they are very friendly. Not a fan of the music they played tonight (cussing) but normally it's fine, it won't keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"I loved how fresh it was! Gyro meat wasn't greasy like other places and we felt welcomed. I was digging the salad!"}
{"text":"Gyro House was a hit! We had Original Gyros with Greek salads and they were delicious! The service was excellent, servings were large and prices reasonable. We were too full for desert but brought baklava home for a midnight snack.   I can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"Had the beef and lamb gyros and Greek salad! So good can't wait ti return and try something different! They are very nice and it's clean.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food every time!  The hummus is the best I've ever had. Portions are large."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you are looking for a family feel restaurant with great food for a great price! We had the hummus and the lamb gyro and it was super good!!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!!! We ate here and the food was okay. We both had a gyro salad on our way to the airport. Once we got to the airport we were both in full on \"meat sweats\". We couldn't get to a bathroom fast enough. Both of our stomachs were churning and burning in agony. We were wrecked until the next day. There is absolutely no doubt that we were fully poisoned. I WOULD NOT recommend eating here. EVER!!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing love the Greek fries and chicken shwarma so good. Adela and Sam are great.  This is our favorite place for lunch."}
{"text":"The wait for some customers was up to 40 minutes. I was given my order first and they skipped 5 other people. When I was done with my meal, the second person in line still didn't have their meal.  The food was good, not the best gyro in the valley, but filled my craving. I feel bad for the other people still waiting after 40 minutes. The restaurant is very disorganized and needs better management. The length of time it is taking to send food out it's very disappointing. I've been here just observing and it takes 20 minutes for each couple to receive their dishes.  The customer service is significantly deficient and I won't be coming back again just because I fear waiting an hour for food. I think you're better off spending an extra dollar and going somewhere like Halal Guys for a gyro pita."}
{"text":"Gyro House is pretty good. I've been twice for lunch and once for dinner. Each time the establishment has been clean. Staff welcoming and friendly. Menu easy to read. Service relatively quick. Food has been fresh and tasty. Prices are average. Try the beef and lamb gyro special with salad. The meat is really good and they fill the pita full! I still need to try more of the menu to taste all the different foods they have like the pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb and hummus.  Something that I eat a lot of at another Greek place.   I was so disappointed the lamb had NO flavor at all and the hummus not so good.   The employees were nice and the place looked clean but for 21.00 I was expecting something with a taste like ningreek flavor at all :("}
{"text":"I ordered the original gyro plate and substituted the spicy hummus instead of the rice. It was awesome and big enough for two people to share. I also bought some baklava which they do not make- I wish they made it fresh as it was just ok. There is plenty of seating. I am so glad I tried it out."}
{"text":"I would say this is one of the best places to get Mediterranean food.  I have never had such creamy hummus before.  Even the jalape√±o/cilantro hummus is not too spicy (and I am a wimp). They meats are juicy and seasoned to perfection.  Their rice is my favorite from any other Mediterranean restaurant.  Any of the Kabob dishes are delicious.  They also serve a lot of food.  We have gotten the family deal that has all the meats, and that is enough for 4 or 5 people.  A great deal for the price.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and fantastic service. The owners are so friendly and welcoming and I've loved everything I've ever ordered there. Try the gyro pizza!"}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is incredible. A must try for anyone that enjoys Greek food. The staff is delightful as well."}
{"text":"My new favorite for gyros! So, long My Big Fat Greek Restaurant! This is truly authentic food. I haven't had this good of shawarma since I was in Turkey."}
{"text":"Excellent food loved this place definitely coming back it's the first place that actually has the real taste of Greek food"}
{"text":"Daily Special Lamb & Beef Pita & Chicken Schwarma Pita were good. Get the fries. The rice needs something, maybe some veggies. We tried the Dolma appetizer. Asked them to nuke them as they were chilled, slick and flavorless. Nuking didn't help them. We ate the veggies on the plate and asked for a take home. I try to warm them up to see what they taste like. We will go back and try the Gyro salad with dressing on the side.Think we will share the $13.99 Beef Kabab entrie."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Almost the most authentic pizza that I've actually ever tasted here in Arizona. Everything I've had there is delicious, however the one thing I don't really care for is there Zieke sauce. They seem to be pretty well known, and looks like they need some more help with staff, because they have so many people coming, because of how good their food is."}
{"text":"Gyro meat was tender, pita was fresh and fries were hot. The owners take pride in their craft and it shows through in their food and service. Haven't ventured outside the gyro plate, but it's the best gyro I've had in the East Valley!"}
{"text":"We were excited for this place when it first opened a couple years back and were impressed enough on our first visit to give it a second try. Unfortunately, on my second visit, an overcooked and over salted lamb shank together with lackluster service kept us away for over a year. Since it's a local place for us, my wife and I thought we'd give it another try. We were both given COLD gyro meat and a tabouli salad that was so lemony as to be inedible. Together with glacial and haphazard service, it was one of the more depressing meals we've had in a long time. Sadly, we will never return. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I have been to Gyro House about 8 times over the past couple years. Each occasion was a great experience.   I went yesterday and it was a completely different experience. I ordered 7 gyro, 1 lb of gyro meat, and 2 metal tins of their rice to-go.   I believe this is under new ownership because I didn't recognize the current staff.   I was offered either the styrofoam to-go box of the rice for $4.99, or the metal tin for $7.99 I chose the tins since it was double the amount of the to-go boxes. However, upon arriving home each of the metal tins were only 1/2 full, equivalent to the to go boxes at $4.99 They both could have been combined into one single tin...   We did receive plenty of tzatziki sauce, but it was different as well. It was much more lemony and runny. The tzatziki sauce were also placed on top of the two tins of warm rice, a big no no as the cold tzatziki will become warm and runny, which it did.   Every single one of the gyro sandwiches had pieces of unchewable pieces of gristle or something else which was harder. I have not encountered this at all during previous visits. Either they received a bad batch of gyro or they have changed to a cheaper quality of gyro.  I hope this is not a precursor of things to come, but we will see. I will give them another shot before calling it a day and moving on.  Recommendations: Go back to whatever meat you were using before, do not place refrigerated items in with warm food. Fill the tins up correctly if you are going to offer the larger size at a higher price.  The restaurant was clean, the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good (Greek is not my fave), the prices are good, except kinda bummed the combo doesn't already come with a drink. The owner is AWESOME though. He came and talked with me and my baby girl while our food was being cooked. He was a genuine nice guy and had my daughter laughing the whole time we were waiting. I'll come here regularly just to support an owner that takes time to get to know his customers."}
{"text":"The feel of this place is super casual and almost diner like. You order at a counter and can either take it to go or eat there. The baklava is PHENOMENAL and honestly I'm in love. I also get the beef and lamb gyro pita which really hits the spot every time (their fries are great too). The staff is fun and friendly and I find myself missing this place if I haven't been in too long, that's how you know you've found a winner. My mom and I love stopping here when we won't something good but also hassle free. It's really inexpensive as well!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have eaten here a few times. I know they had a few issues at the beginning trying to get it all running smoothly, but they seem to have gotten it together. One of the getter Mediterranean style food places I have had in this area. We have tried multiple items on the menu and have not had a bad experience with any of it. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The owner greeted us at the door. She was so excited to serve us. We had  a specific dietary need. This was not a problem for them. She was GREAT!!. We love this place. Her employee was very friendly and helpful. The food was very fresh, tasty and of excellent quality. We visited here from south of Tucson and would make it a point to go out of our way again to stop here and eat. Best Gyro in Phoenix. Their Greek Dressing is Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"We've been to this family-owned casual Greek place many times now and can't get enough. I rarely rate something so casual as \"5-star\" but these guys hit the mark every time with the food and service.  Their platters with meat or falafel come with 2 of: rice, Greek salad, hummus or fries.  All at so good, it's hard to decide on just 2. And the platters are huge.  Good enough to fill up and take the rest home to another whole meal.  The pitas and salads are also excellent.  They do offer creative pizzas as well, but we have yet to try those.  And we have never saved enough room to try the tantalizing homemade baklava on display at the counter. This place is clean and simple in decor."}
{"text":"Got the wanted family platter. Rice and salad was ok. But the kabobs are disgusting. Meat was rare and overseasoned  with some red spice.  Beef kabobs were inedible. Chicken kabob was gross. Ground beef was weird  and red inside. Never go back. The cook needs to be fired! Plus cross contamination of raw meat."}
{"text":"The food was good here.  The service was okay.  The atmosphere could use some work, but it is a basic Gyro shop."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is amazing. The owner gives great customer service and everything I have tried here I have loved it. Prices are good. I go here probably once a week."}
{"text":"This place is really tasty and clean.  They also have really good customer service which was refreshing.  I highly recommend trying the hummus!!"}
{"text":"Great food, and reasonable price! Real Greek family run. Authentic!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. I am Italian so believe me when I say this, their pizza is amazing. Not traditional pizza but so good. I have not had anything I didn't like but I will be going back for that pizza again and again"}
{"text":"Delicious falafel and chicken shwarma. Call ahead because take out can take a long time."}
{"text":"I've ordered here a couple times and everytime it's delicious and hot! I love how fast you can pick up the food. Only negative is they do not deliver but it's close so no problem for me"}
{"text":"Ate a falafel pita about 6 hours ago. Just spent half an hour violently vomiting big rough chunks of falafel while in the shower. Safe to say i will not be returning, and i will never eat falafel ever again."}
{"text":"I tried this place when the big fat greek restaurant closed and it is now one of my favorite lunch places. They have great lunch specials. Nothing is better than their chicken schawarma!  They also have an amazing garlic sauce. The owners are so nice and always explaining the food and options. I have to stop in at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous. Some of the best middle eastern food I've had. Nice extensive menu.   Best tabbouleh around, hummus too is  among the best I've had. Love this place."}
{"text":"The owners were extremely nice. The food was great. If you have a weekly greek craving, go here. It will fulfill them. If you don't and you are just venturing out, go here."}
{"text":"This restaurant was right next to a contracting school I was taking, and I was very glad I stopped in here for lunch.  Loved my Gyro so much I had to go in the next day to take the lady's suggestion of trying the Chicken Shawarma!  You can't go wrong with either selection.  Pita bread was very fresh and very tasty as well."}
{"text":"Good food and service, went today and the chicken and gyro were both great. My daughter had the cheese pizza which was also very good. Very fair prices will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"CLEAN place, made from scratch, delicious food, friendly owners.  I have eaten there at least 10 times and I love it.  It's wonderful to have a healthy choice so close to where I work.  Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Took an hour from time of order to getting our food. They also didn't have all of the food we ordered, missing the grilled veggies."}
{"text":"Just ate their for the first time, definitely won't be my last! Greek salad with chicken is lights out."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant, fast service, excellent food. It was my first time and thoroughly enjoyed it. If you like gyros I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! The owners are just the nicest people you'll ever meet and the food is consistently amazing! I always order the chicken schwarma here, but everything is delicious! Try the gyro pizza or their new Chicago dogs!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. All of our food was very clearly made fresh and with high quality ingredients. The owner / chef stopped by the table to check on how we liked the food and genuinely cared what we had to say.   We had the Gyro, which was very flavorful with one of the best Tzatziki sauces I've had. We also had beef kabob and chicken Schwarma.   The rice is moist and excellently flavored. You know they care when they spend time to make their rice stand out.   The Greek salad was made with nice fresh lettuces and a great herb and oil dressing.  The hummus is also amazing. If you like jalepeno and cilantro you must try the spicy, it is like amazing Greek guacamole. The classic was tasty as well.  All in all, great experience."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma pizza is delicious. Sumac seasoning on top to add spicy flavor. It was great leftover that day and the next morning after being refrigerated -I ordered the biggest one they had. I also called ahead because service is sometimes slow. Food has always been delicious though."}
{"text":"Just went again. I love it. Finally got the wife to try it (so picky) and she loved the chicken pita. We also ordered the smallest pepperoni pizza to try; very good as well. Again, I had the house special gyro and it was delicious. So much delicious meat."}
{"text":"My first time visiting the Gyro House, but it won't be the last!!   The lamb kabobs were crispy on the outside, with the typical \"chew\" that lamb chunks should have...Yum! The chicken shwarma was tender and so flavorful. Spicy hummus was creamy and delicious.  Clean and friendly or I wouldn't bother to review.   I took a lot of time deciding, and. allowed several other patrons to pick up their to go orders while I made up my mind. I was really impressed by those who shared their favorites and offered suggestions.  Can't wait to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food was OK. Rice was oily and there were more onions than one person should ever eat in a lifetime. The service was horrible! I stood at the front counter waiting to order for five minutes before a man came out from the back and said I'll get somebody to help you. In walked Derek-smelling like an ashtray. He has got to be the rudest person I have ever encountered in the food Service industry. We sat and watched as several other families walked up to the counter and experienced the same attitude we did. Something as simple as asking him to change the syrup on the Coke machine was more than he could handle. Spare yourself the frustration and do not eat here."}
{"text":"My first time here lunch was very good it was a little slow when I got there looked over the menu everything sounded great but just went with the lunch comb for the day which was lamb&beef pita plus side Togo the lady that took my order was very friendly very helpful loved it will be back for more"}
{"text":"My son and I were debating on what food to get. Of course, we have our holdouts. Unable to come to a conclusion we decided to eat at Gyro House. The food here is amazing and the staff is wonderful. During this visit I had a platter consisting of Lamb gyro and falafel. This honestly was some of the best Falafel I have had in a long time. Come here ... bring your family. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food, especially the hummus, was very bland.  The steak and chicken was overdone and dry.  Did I mention the food was bland?   Best pet was the actual pita bread, which was the the reason for two stars not one.  Will not be back.  We really wanted to like this place.  Not so much.  No flavor"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to find good gyros. I had the vegetarian platter and it was the best. The dolmas, falafels, and hummus were extremely fresh.   If traveling to the Meza, AZ you should definitely check out this place. The pricing is midrange but the food is excellent."}
{"text":"The gyros are okay. They don't put much meat in. If you really like gyros I'd recommend George's Famous Gyros where they pile on the meat and the meat itself has amazing flavor."}
{"text":"Nothing short of yumminess! Their gyro meat is tender, the salads are fresh, the chicken shwarma is my ultimate fave, and they give good sized portions. The newer owners, Heidi & Jon and their staff, (of almost 2 months) are very friendly and the establishment is clean. Very casual, to go orders are quick, and they even have Greek pizza (chicken shwarma - omg) a salmon entree, fish & chips, and sides like fried zuke, onion rings, and Greek fries with feta, olive oil and spices - you can even ask to add meat to them for an extra cost. Standard Greek menu - kabobs, pitas, falafel, hummus, etc. All good! Great \"mom & pops\" place. I'm becoming a regular here!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is great. The gyros are awesome, full of meat and extra sauce. If they have baklava on special get it. It's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Last time we were here, the young guy serving us made this place worth the visit. Food was good, but service was excellent. This time, some guy with a bad attitude really did his best to make sure we don't come back. We left before finishing our order."}
{"text":"My hubby had double Philly Cheese steak and he loved it! He's usually picky about every sandwich in town but he loved this one! I had the the Gyro salad and it was huge! Soo much meat that was delish! The manager was really friendly, great customer service."}
{"text":"With all the amazing Yelp reviews I wanted to be really impressed with the food here. Unfortunately, it fell flat.  There are a few places in the valley that are my go to Greek/Gyro take-out, but we will not be coming back. I ordered the gyro sandwich and wanted to taste the bursting flavors of the gyro meet. I was disappointed that it did not. We shared the hummus and after a few bites I just didn't even want to touch it. The only thing good about the food here was the pita bread. The pita was soft and warm. I guess we can all be picky eaters but this place was not for us."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend for lunch.  The food and service were great.  But what made this place a 5 star experience was the cleanliness.  When a patron was finished and left the restaurant they not only cleaned the table and chairs but they used a broom and dustpan and cleaned under the table so there was no residue from the previous customers lunch on the floor.  BRAVO!!!!!  I would definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here based on yelp reviews. Like other folks have said, looks generic/strip mall on the outside, but delicious on the inside:). Great selection of Greek food.  My husband had the regular gyro (lamb and beef) with greek fries  and I had the Chicken Chily pita (chicken shawarma with grilled onions and jalape√±os) with a side salad.  My food was great. Loved the salad and loved the pita.  I swear if I could I would buy the Oita bread alone and it eat all day. It was fluffy, flavorful, and just so good. My husband loved his gyro and in particular said the tasiki(sp? Lol) sauce was really good. He liked the Greek fries okay, but said they had too much flavor going on for him (they have herbs, Greek dressing, and feta).  We will be taking out son back this week while we're here for a gyro"}
{"text":"The owner was incredibly friendly and welcoming, the facility was clean and open, I got a beef shawarma pita and it was good / not over-priced. Definitely a good experience. Will be coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Great hummus rice and gyros. We love this place. I like the garlic in the traditional hummus and my husband likes the spicy jalapeno style.  Everything is great that we've tried. If you're getting to-go make sure to double check your order so that you don't leave without ALL of the delicious things you've ordered."}
{"text":"Not bad! Had the beef & lamb gyro served with seasoned fries. The menu selection was huge and includes pictures which was nice and helpful. Overall, taste was not bad; I was surprised by the mix of meat as I was hoping to have lamb but it's a good enough mix that the lamb isn't overpowered. Temperature of the food is what made this 3 stars vs 4; the fries were great but both my and my friend 's meat was warm rather than hot/fresh. Still, I enjoyed my meal :) We're likely to come back because the prices and portions are very fair and the service was friendly and speedy."}
{"text":"Today I went in for lunch and had the best falafel and hummus I have ever had!  The falafel was soft hot deliciousness and the jalape√±o cilantro was very fresh and so good too. Also I have had they're shwarma and fries for lunch another time which I really enjoyed. I just might become a regular :)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! Generous portions, flavorful salad, and tender chicken shwarma!! Will definitely be back to this place again. Also very clean, and friendly service."}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean places. I'm visiting from California, I found this place on Yelp. Our cashier was wonderful, she was so nice. We ordered \"The Wanted\" family feast and a small side of hummus. The feast is quite the feast that we weren't expecting since it didn't show in the menu, so for $34 we got a literal feast. Very well worth it. It came with a large plate of rice, salad, 5 choices of meats or falafel and a side of pita bread. Feeds a family of 4.  Very tasty, fulfilling and the meat was tender. I will def come back next time I'm in AZ.   Cleanliness 5/5 Service 5/5 Food 5/5"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options. I F'ing overdosed on this joint the other night. Falafel pita w/ added spicy hummus, Falafel al a cart, and Greek fries. Taste was amazing. I've heard the lamb burrito isn't that great, but I don't know when a lamb burrito would be a good option anyway. Eat less meat people! It's wrecking our environment! #meethooked"}
