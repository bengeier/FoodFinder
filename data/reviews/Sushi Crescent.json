{"text":"I went here before work one night and was pleasantly surprised.
All the dishes I ordered came out quick smart and it was all quite fresh. They didn't mess around with tiny portions of sashimi either which I was more than happy with. The bigger the cuts of salmon sashimi the more happy my belly feels. All in all I ordered way more than I would at a normal sushi restaurant for a whole lot less.

P.s. I believe these guys are under the same family as Sushi St-Denis but I'm more of a fan of this spot than the St-Denis restaurant."}
{"text":"It is what it is: all-you-can-eat sushi in downtown Montreal. I mean if you're from Vancouver you'll probably think its like the worst sushi experience ever but for us Eastern Canadians who just like to gorge ourselves with spicy salmon rolls it does the trick. My boyfriend and I love sushi--we're regular sushi whores--so we absolutely love AYCE just because we can order as much as we want! Our order is usually the same: two miso soups, a green salad, chicken teriyaki, 20 or so salmon roses, 3 orders of spicy salmon, a Philadelphia roll, maybe a Dynamite (if the tempura is fresh), vegetable tempura, and green tea ice cream to top it all off. We've got it down to a science--even memorizing the menu item numbers you write down on those little pieces of paper! But its definitely not the best. I would stick to the rolls here if I were you, they're dependable. I've had the actual sushi and its not bad but the quality of the fish is definitely not grade-A. The service is better here at Sushi Crescent versus Tokyo Sushi--further along Ste-Catherine towards Concordia--where it is absolutely terrible! Terrible! Here it is marginally better, but again pretty bad. You have to be very forceful, hand them you're order directly (don't wait for them to come to take it). They might try and stick you with stuff you didn't order but tell them right away you actually didn't and they'll take it back. I have a theory, they want you to pay extra for uneaten sushi! Evil they are I tell you, ha! 

The location is pretty nice actually. I seem to remember that it used to be a bar or lounge and the new owners have kept much of the same interior but added a sushi-prep area both upstairs and down. You might have to wait on weekends as it does fill up fast. Also, they jacked up the price recently. Which was a real piss off. It used to be $15 each and now its like $21 after taxes but before tip. Which is quickly approaching unaffordable territory if you don't order very much."}
{"text":"Une rue bien animée ou l'on trouve pas mal de bar-restaurants  Au moins ici il y en a pour tous les budgets et l'on fini par se trouver son bar ou son restaurant ou s'installer avec les copains et copines  :-)"}
{"text":"Food is Ok. Best rolls are definitely the Spicy Salmon & the Caviar Sous-marin. However, the waiting time for each order is 40-50 minutes!!!! We decided to order a second time and before that second order arrived, the waiter came to say that they were about to close the kitchen and it was the last call! So, it really is more of an All-you-can-order before they close the kitchen. Our orders also came incomplete.
The waiters were not very polite, specially the girl at the door. When we asked her for an estimate on the waiting time, she answered she had no idea and had no intention of finding out. Not worth the wait. Kanda is WAY better in my opinion."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a Saturday of a long weekend so we knew it would be busy. We waited for a table for about 15 minutes or so. The host was very efficient if not a little curt. 

Once we were seated and placed our order it wasn't long before the fod arrived--and it was delish! We tried just about every Maki roll, along with fried tofu (fantastic), tempura and the usual appies.  They missed a few of choices  but they promptly brought them over as soon as we told them.

One thing to keep in mind is that the all you eat sushi part deal is over at 3 (final orders in by 250). We were seated at 220 and we didn't have much time to put a second order in. I felt rushed because if this and wished we could have had more time to order and eat.

One more annoyance was the fact that he brought our dessert, three bowls of ice cream, to the table before all of our sushi had arrived. This forced us to eat it in the middle of our meal before it melted. How hard would it have been to wait and dish it later?

Bottom line food was delish but service was lacking but I wouldn't really expect much more from an all you can eat sushi place on one of the busiest streets in Montreal. Make sure you give yourself enough time to eat as much as you like without feeling rushed."}

{"text":"Disclaimer: sushi was amazing! If my rating was based solely on the sushi itself, it would have been a 5.

Bestie and I were craving some sushi this afternoon. Did a quick YELP! search today to find some! We were directed to Sushi Crescent. 

Walked in, were warned it was closing in half an hour - which was fine. We are sushi queens and have no issue speed-ordering. The gentleman who greeted us was very pleasant and welcoming, even though we walked in so late. 

We were served some water as we sat down; however, not really spoken to by the waitress.  We wrote down our first order, sat it on the edge of the table and waited. A minute passed... 5 minutes passed. The waitress had been in and out of our section a few times by this point. Finally, we had to call her over to take our order. She snatched the paper off our table and disappeared. We were not offered drinks. 

It was a longer than average wait for the sushi. Which wouldn't have been a bad thing if the restaurant wasn't closing in fifteen minutes. We prepped our last call order of sushi just in case. 

Sushi and rolls showed up about ten-twelve minutes later. We had to call her back to our table again to take our last call order because she basically threw the plates on our table and turned. 

The shrimp sushi I had was amazing. Fresh and appetizing. The rolls - dynamite, red dragon, kamikaze, mango salmon, avocado cucumber, and spicy shrimp tempura - were great! They had just enough rice in them! Every flavour could actually be tasted and enjoyed. Overall, the food was great! Definitely recommend to anyone. 

Last but not least, I had basically just taken my last bite when the waitress showed up again with bills in hand and asked us if we'd like to pay by card. So, being rushed out of the restaurant, we decided to pay by card. Next thing I know, I hear the waitress say 'you know the tip isn't included right?' to my friend. My friend tips in cash, typically after the waiter/waitress leaves our table... As is typical at any reataurant. We were both quite taken aback by this and decided to just get up and leave (we had both completed our transactions btw). 

We thanked the man who initially seated us and took off. 

Service = Boo. 
Food = Great! 
Do I recommend? Yes. If you are patient enough to wait around and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"One the best sushi experience ever.  If you like fast service this is it. You have to keep up with the waiters but well worth it. They don't treat you like royalty but I kinda like that, they are more on the casual side of hurry up and order."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the ice cream. Because of the all-you-can-eat menu, the staff were busy running around, often forgetting orders. I ordered drinks 4 times from two waiters, was acknowledged each time, but still no drinks came. The all-you-can-eat menu may be vast, but everyone was subpar. Lastly the prices are pretty high and definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Avec la rue Peel, de nombreux pubs, billards, de quoi bien attaquer la soirée (dès 17h30...), soit en montant les petits escaliers, soit en les descendant. D'autant plus pratique l'hiver que c'était à 2 rues de chez moi (et par -18°C, c'est appréciable)."}
{"text":"The service was nothing to write home about. The server actually seemed pissed off the entire time. We didn't get anyone to take our drink order for almost ten minutes so we got up to leave and the server ran over (from doing nothing) and convinced us to stay...then walked away and still didn't take our drink order!! Besides all of that, the food was decent, came out quickly, and it was all you can eat. Everything was in small portions so if you liked something you could order more. The menu was also huge so there was stuff for everyone. It wasn't the best sushi I had ever had, but it was a cool concept. I think if our service was better, it would have been a better experience."}

{"text":"Je suis devenu amateur de sushis sur le tard, il y a quelques années. J'ai passé plus de 30 ans de ma vie à n'y voir aucun intérêt. Triste, quand même, toutes ces années perdues ;). Pour moi, Sushi Crescent est donc comme une sorte de caverne d'Ali Baba où je peux déguster à peu près toutes les sortes de sushis sans y perdre ma chemise. Évidemment, l'idée est d'y aller en groupe et de commander des dizaines d'éléments du menu. Mais attention, vous payez 1$ par morceau non mangé (un collègue et moi avons ainsi terminé un repas en vidant la table, je crois que je n'ai jamais autant mangé de toute ma vie - soyez prudents, donc). Je ne peux pas vraiment vous recommander quoi que ce soit en particulier, tous les sushis sont très bons, qu'il s'agisse des classiques ou des burritos sushis, franchement excellents."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for supper, and the sushi quality is pretty decent. They have fountain soft drinks included in the price which is pretty cool. The fish is fresh as I love to get the sashimi. I also enjoyed the handrolls here. They also offer a lot of different kitchen dishes and specialty rolls. I was very surprised that they had torched salmon belly sushi on the menu. Noticed that when we ordered the spicey mussels, they didn't clean them very well. The service was pretty fast as this place is located on Crescent, it gets busy during the dinner rush. Rating this place 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Arrived for dinner around 7:30 pm on Saturday September 3rd, immediately got seated.

I didn't even have to ask our waitress for water (or refills!) - this is huge to me, especially regarding refills. It proves they're observant.

We placed our order and our food came very quickly. It was fresh and delicious and they didn't forget a single item that we ordered."}
{"text":"This place is a no-go for me. It is two floors and crazy busy due to the all-you-can-eat menu. They do have a-la-carte by the way, but you have to ask for it.

I was on my own when I went there, and a couple who came in afterwards was seated first. I should have left then, but was hungry and on the hook to bring sushi home.

The service was slow and the food was not bad but not great either. Every time I caught the waiter's attention, it felt like he was doing me a favor by coming over.

There are so many good places to go in downtown Montreal. This is not one of them."}

{"text":"Really good but service ULTRA SLOW. They forgot many items on our order and also brought us items we didn't order like hand rolls. Do not plan on coming in and out. Been here 2 hours and pushed the waiter to serve us faster."}
{"text":"Hum, quel régal! Un grand resto avec un panoplie de serveurs tous les uns plus attentionnés que les autres. Dès qu'un plat est terminé, il est aussitôt débarrassé de la table. Seul les verres d'eau n'était pas dans leur ligne de mire, car nous avons attendu la fin du repas avant qu'ils prennent conscience que les verres étaient vides. On a fait le test d'attendre pour voir leur réaction. 
Quoi qu'il en soit, ce n'est pas cher pour la qualité et la quantité de plats que l'on peut avoir! 
L'accueil et le service est très chaleureux!"}
{"text":"Went to this sushi place, because it has \"all you can eat\" option, intended to order a lot of items at once and enjoy every each of them. However, the table for two person they have was so small, that it could barely fit a couple of dishes at the same time.  Bigger tables were reserved for people in a group of 3 minimum, that's why the staff refused to give it to us when we asked them to. The distance between tables could only fit one person walking, that made it difficult even for waiters to distribute plates with orders. 
The food was delicious though, I really liked salmon sashimi and \"Philadelphia\" rolls. The menu was a little confusing, it had a lot of items, but not all of them had pictures. So, be careful about ordering a lot of items you don't know the taste of, because the restaurant charges fee for each item you leave uneaten. 
Another good point about the place is that pop drinks are also all you can drink, which is not very common for sushi AYCE types. 
In general, I will say it is a good place to eat if you are not too concerned about the layout of the tables and lack of space and privacy."}
{"text":"It was amazing!  Great time with great food!!!! You have to wait for at least 30 minutes,  but it worth it! good selection from sushi, to sashimi and hand rolls as well. We were seated on the second floor, you take the menu and write the number of which sushi and quantity you want.  The only thing that got me little bit sad is that we ordered food but we Didnt know what was coming and if its coming,  because some of the stuff didn't come out from the kitchen.  You pay $27.99 for adult from Friday to Sunday. And kids under 10, pay $18.99. Overall sushi are great and fresh.  Yummy! Next time I'm in Montreal,  I'm definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"The weekend dinner price is quite a hike from the weekday price, but the quality and variety was good and made up for it. The sashimi was fresh, the miso soup was flavourful, the tempura and hot items were good. The few let-downs included the tempura squid rings which were too chewy and too battered, and the rolls didn't contain the traditional/commonly known ingredients (details aren't on the menu). Nonetheless, planning to return for all you can eat in Montreal."}
{"text":"OK, I am a Japanese New Yorker. 

The worst sushi joint I've been in a long, long time. You can't call it a sushi place without tuna or yellowtail on the menu. the rice was dry and flavorless, fish was so thin you didn't taste anything, and service was below acceptable with throwing of the napkins on the table and the general unfriendliness.

teriyaki sauce was too sweet - non-Japanese idea of teriyaki. chinese dishes were decent. 

our friend likes it there, but he is not Asian and not familiar with the cuisine. never again for us."}
{"text":"Whenever I come here with friends the sushi has been consistently good. The fish is fresh, the service is quick, and the price is reasonable.

Sushi Crescent has a funky decor that makes me wonder what it used to be before it became a sushi place... But that was before my time.

If you're in downtown and you want good sushi, all you can eat, Crescent is a good, reliable option."}
{"text":"I'm a fan, definitely a good selection for all you can eat especially during lunch hours. The sushi is fresh, up to my standards as a sushi enthusiast and on par with some of my favourite all you can eat places in Toronto. 

The service can sometimes be slow so my recommendation is just keep busting out sheets of 5-8 items at a time. This way you wont waste precious eating time waiting for your motherboard of sushi.

The atmosphere is also great! I would recommend it"}
{"text":"First time I came here with some other elites on a Saturday afternoon, the place was packed. 
We had a great spot by the window. 

The menu for this AYCE sushi is typical plus unlimited pop included in the menu. Thumbs up -but they don't taken debit card?! Only credit and cash. Odd no? For groups of 6 and up, service fee is included. So it came out to 24$ per person with tax and tip! Yay

The quality of sushi was average - I enjoyed the sides more (be warned the seaweed salad was frozen when I got it, the salmon tartar comes on a pringle chip, the sushi pizza, good tempura  and mango yogurt dessert were my favourites). 

The service was a bit slow as expected since there were so many people...my hunt for a decent AYCE sushi continues..."}
{"text":"Une belle surprise, service rapide. On choisit à la carte nos sushis. Goûteux, beaucoup de choix, pas très cher (aucune idée du prix, j'étais invitée...)"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the selection.
The evening selection includes 168 items,  for about $25.

The sushi includes many rolls not normally seen in an AYCE and it's a good thing their menu is now posted online so you can plan ahead.

Now this is buffet sushi so the quality was not the best, the biggest letdown being the rice. My first trip a year earlier was far better than this recent one.

Some rolls seemed like they were made and then put in the fridge waiting for an order. The rice was very compact and did not dissolve in the mouth.


On the plus side, the many non sushi items are pretty good, like tempura shrimp, beef udon noodles and teriyaki.

The decor is quite bright and elegant ( I think it was an old Victorian home).
The first floor is a bit crowded and the washrooms are tiny, but I would rather be on the first than the second since the service seems quicker with the waiters not having to constantly move up and down.

I was pretty happy with the service, very quick and efficient, while not overly friendly.
People that complain about AYCE staff should keep in mind how busy and crowded these places are, especially downtown."}
{"text":"Delicious!
When ordering items to go, the restaurant always prepares my order within 5-10 minutes. I am only sad that they do not serve sashimi during lunch hours ._. 
Always courteous service.
Some quick favorites and ideas if you're feeling uninspired:
Salmon sashimi
Beef tataki
Enoki mushroom rolls
Phoenix Roll (fried)
Dragon roll (fried)
Smoked salmon rainbow roll

*drool*"}
{"text":"Out of all the sushi buffets in Montreal, I've being to this place the most!
The food here is overall really good. The sushis, sashimis and tempuras are always what I put my focuses on. Each one of those are well done. However, this place doesn't have much personality  in the sense that they don't have their speciality, everything they offer can be found somewhere else. But if you are simply looking for a decent sushi meal then this is for sure a place to go!
As for the service, I've heard and read many complains but I never experienced anything bad. The waiters and waitresses are alright. I mean it's not somewhere where you come and expects to be served like in a michelin class restaurant lol."}
{"text":"Meh. The reviews took us here, but we were honestly quite disappointed, especially given the price. Everything tasted the same, the fish was not super fresh, they forgot at least one thing we ordered, and the service was slow and inattentive. The one roll that was different and great was the Phoenix roll.
That being said, the cooked or non-sushi dishes were quite delicious. Maybe because the cooks were Chinese and not Japanese.
In downtown Montreal with so many options, we would never return."}
{"text":"Went for the first time against my better judgement a few weeks ago, because a friend insisted she goes all the time and has never gotten ill (yes, a huge worry for me when it comes to all you can eat sushi places). The lunch was alright, with the highlights being the salmon rose (rice with salmon wrapped around it instead of seaweed and a dollop of spicy mayo on top), the sauteed garlic mushrooms and the seaweed salad. Went back for dinner a few days later, since we wanted AYCE but didn't want to trek all the way to our usual place, Sushi Plus on Beaumont. BIG mistake! Every roll we tried literally tasted the same and was mostly mayo and rice. We also ordered the spicy ramen and my dinner mate was ready to keel over since it was so spicy.  No real flavor, just spice. The noodles looked like spaghetti noodles instead of ramen. The so-called tempura onions were huge hard-to-eat slabs of onion and the tempura coating was completely soaked in oil. We winced our way through eating them (and while some portions are small on the menu, this item actually was oversized and hence, added to the pain of trying to finish it). When I used the washroom, I had time to look around at all the boxes and storage area near the WC, and saw how dirty the resto is. There was a sushi \"chef\" cutting up large pieces of raw salmon on the counter nearby, and I noticed he just left at one point with all the raw salmon simply sitting on the counter. He didn't even come back for the rest of our stay, which was a good additional 20+ minutes. So there the salmon sat, unrefrigerated, looking all sad. And there we were, looking pretty sad too, worried that we were going to suffer food poisoning. The biggest and last insult to our meal was when we went down to pay. We asked if they had any student discounts (since other AYCE places do) and they said yes, so my dinner mate showed her student ID. THEN the cashier proceeded to add up our bill on a calculator, never touching the register, and simply turning the calculator towards us to show the total. I was shocked, so I asked her for a real receipt and she simply said \"I can give you a receipt for the adult meal, but we don't give receipts for student meals since we don't have a way to enter it in the register\"????? So basically, they are able to pocket the money whenever a student comes and asks for the discount and avoid paying taxes. Considering how close they are to Concordia, that's a fortune....Overall, dirty place, unremarkable sushi, with many plates just being outright hard to swallow, they don't include soft drinks in their price, and they skim on the taxes...all while reminding you to leave a tip when you pay. Never again. I don't even want this place showing up on my Yelp profile labeling me as a \"regular\" for checking in twice LOL."}
{"text":"I love sushi and this is a good place to try as many different kinds as you can handle. The portion sizes are small so you don't get full off only one thing... Except the rice, only order the rice if you only want to eat rice it's huuuge!! The rolls are all quite similar but all taste super yummy :) The seaweed salad is fantastic and not too big which makes the perfect entrée. The waiters/waitress' are purely there to get the job done and need to be flagged down to get their attention. Students get a discount if they pay cash and if they alert the waiter/waitress beforehand and must show a valid student card at the register. Sushi comes quick after it is ordered and tastes very fresh... Overall a good place to be once you understand how to communicate with the waitress/waiters and a paper of ingredients of what is in the rolls can be acquired upon request. Yum :)"}
{"text":"For all-you-can-eat sushi, this was pretty great (and believe me, I've tried a lot of places). Of course you can't expect the same quality, but if you have a massive craving for sushi and not much cash in your pocket, this hits the spot. We went for lunch: for 17$, it was a good deal. Though the lack of sashimi was disappointing, there was still a lot of variety. 
I liked the fact that they give you an electronic \"receipt\" of your order. It avoids all the \"um, are you sure we ordered this?\" or \"um, where is that salmon handroll we ordered?\" The servers were polite and quite fast. Water was always promptly filled. 
I also found that they don't use as much rice as other AYCE sushi places. More salmon for you! 
Beware though, they only take credit or cash. If you only have a debit card, you'll need to withdraw cash from the ATM (and pay a 2$ fee). 

All in all: satisfying."}
{"text":"Way better ayce in Toronto. Sushi had way too much rice and very little fish. Ramen tastes like they put packet seasoning in it. Service is unfriendly and slammed on your table. I regret coming here...its a waste of money and you can get better sushi elsewhere. Also the washroom is a single and toilets don't flush..."}
{"text":"I ate at Sushi Crescent with a few friends last week. 
The food quality was consistent, and many dishes were quite good. As usual, they forgot a few items we ordered, but since all of their orders are recorded electronically, they simply had to double check to rectify the error. Very useful system!

The interior of the restaurant is quite fancy, with neon-like lights in the walls and easy to clean tables. The decor is the same as that of Sushi Crystal, St-Jean, Ste Catherine and St Denis, which are from the same owner. Pricing is a bit higher than that of competitors at 27.99$ for weekend evenings. 

I feel that many of downtown's all you can eat sushi places are really, really redundant. They serve more or less the same food, the menu is built the same way, pricing is similar, and the service quality is similar (even the plates are the same!). I wouldn't be able to distinguish Sushi Crescent from, let's say, Zushi Sushi solely based on the food, honestly. I wonder if there's like a \"Sushi Boss\" that governs all of these places...?"}
{"text":"I really like the sushi buffet here. The restaurant is nice and the service is great. 
I recommend the Tokyo rolls."}
{"text":"Alright, please don't hate on me.  Coming from the Toronto area, where there is an abundance of AYCE sushi joints, I have fairly high expectations for service at AYCE sushi joints (each order should be served within 10-15 minutes).  

Likes:
-The sushi was pretty decent as was the popcorn chicken.  It was fresh.  
-Once you place your order, they give you an electronic print out of what you ordered, so you can tick it off to make sure you got it. 

Dislikes:
-Way too loud in here.  It's packed but it's so loud, the servers can't hear you.
-It took just over 30 minutes for our first order to arrive and it wasn't that much.  
-We placed the 2nd order right after that as we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes.  We only got a portion of our order after another 40 minutes.  For most Toronto AYCE joints, you have 2 hour limits but you get your food very fast. If this place has a 2 hour limit, then it's not good as all as it shouldn't take that long to get your order out.  
-Servers just dump dishes on your table.  Granted, they are busy, but it needs to be at least respectable.  I find it quite rude to just dump dishes on your table. 

Overall summary: While it is only $15.99, I find that you probably won't get your money's worth unless you order everything upfront.  Not really great value."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Had to wait 35 minutes per each round of orders. They wasted 3 hours of my day. Let aside the fact that the food was average, nothing exciting at all. Go spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is the only place I would go to for AYCE sushi. I always have a great time here with my friends. I'm not really a sushi person but their mango salmon roll makes me shoot rainbows outta my mouth (I never thought mango and salmon would be such great combinations together). 

If you do decide to try this place out, try not to come on a Saturday because the first time I did, there was a pretty long line. There's this one waiter there who is super efficient. I don't think my glass of water ever went half empty. Once you order, the sushi is served pretty quickly.

There was this one time where they gave us a super large portion of ice cream (more than we asked for). Let's just say we had an ice cream coma afterwards. Nonetheless, you can't go wrong with AYCE sushi here."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at this chain. They were extremely rude and made everything difficult for us. And the food was average."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, it's fairly inexpensive with the \"all you can eat\" to order formula. However, the Sushi selection is meager (especially if you like raw fish) and the fish is obviously frozen.

I know that for $15 I should not have expected a lot, however, I had much better experiences in similar places in California and in Las Vegas.

If what you are into is more cooked standard japanese fare (miso soup, edamame, teriyaki, tempura...) and a bit of Sushi, then you'll like it quite a bit. However, if you are a sushi gourmet, there are better places around.

Service was quick and attentive enough for that kind of place. The restaurant itself is nice."}
{"text":"They have the best salmon sushimi.  I really like this place to have sushi bc it is freshly served.  I will be taking my family out here when they come visit.  You have to know how to order to get fast service which is with the pencil and paper.  Try a few than order more to your taste buds!  My favorite are the hand rolls.  You can order as much as you want.  Sushimi is raw, Maki is the rice roll, and Sushi is on top of the rice. I forgot to say its ALL YOU CAN EAT!!"}
{"text":"I always like to write reviews of AYCE sushi places a few days later to be sure no one got sick. Glad to report no illness in our group of 5. The restaurant was half full so within 5 minutes our long table was full of sushi, sashimi, rolls, beef tataki, spicy mayo and various other goodies. Note that they reserve the right to charge you for uneaten pieces. We ordered 10 dumplings and only ate 4 (they were pretty gross) and they didn't charge us. Service is fast, almost too fast... I wonder how they roll that quick. However staff is there to take your order, deliver it, and take away empty plates. Don't expect eye contact, a smile or even a suggestion on what's popular if you dare ask. With all the time they save from not conversing with clients they should clean. The restaurant is pretty gross. Dust everywhere and the bathrooms are some of the grossest I've seen in the city. My daughter refused to even go to bathroom opting to hold it in until we got home after seeing how putrid it was. 
The beef dishes were good, tataki was delicious and the sashimi seemed fresh.  Is that enough to make me want to come back? Nope. There are plenty of other AYCE sushi joints in the city that I'd try before coming back."}
{"text":"Que dire.... ! Aller au restaurant est censé être u moment de détente, chez Sushi Crescent pas vraiment... C'est pour un lunch un lundi que je m'y suis rendue. Les sushis étaient corrects mais le service mérite un ZERO POINTÉ. Obligée de tout leur demander: de l'eau, du wasabi, du gingembre. De refaire partir les plats en cuisine car il y manquait des ingrédients ou parce qu'il y avait une erreur de commande. D'autant plus inacceptable que nous étions les seules à commander à la carte quand tous les autres clients prenaient le all-you-can-eat !"}
{"text":"This restaurant was, in my honest opinion very good until recent changes in the administration, i guess. 

Slow and rude service. After finishing our initial order, it took 20 minutes to get a waiter to get our second one, just to be told that \"the last call\" was made and no food could be delivered to our table.

But here's a hint, if you offer a nice tip to a waiter, he will bring you food you didn't even order.

I had heard (a lot of) bad comments about the service in the past and in my last 3 visits it has become extremely evident.

Good luck, as for myself I'll start looking for a better place."}
{"text":"One of the better AYCE sushi places in Downtown Montréal, especially compared to Zushi Sushi (avoid). 

Is it the best sushi I've ever had? No but I go to these places for variety above all else - not to spend $70 to get sushi rolls, tempura, grilled meats, noodles and ice cream. 

I've been so many times with different groups of friends that the service and the quality of the food fluctuates. Overall, it's pretty decent and there's something for everyone. My other go-to AYCE sushi place is Sushi Crystal."}
{"text":"I know a thing or two about sushi, and can get high at the mere thought of having sushi, especially AYCE.    

The best way to enjoy sushi is to share it with your loved ones. 

Going to the restaurant with baby, I have come to expect to see high chair or booster seats but totally disappointed that there were none. 

My appetite had gradually disappeared but somehow rescued by the sight of dragon eye rolls, salmon skin sushi, shrimp tempura and a myriad of other tempting mini-bouchées.   Quite a pleasant selection, that both my eyes and my taste buds concurred with my assessment. 

Once I have no more room to taste even the slightest small thing, I reflect upon the lack of high chair or booster seats. 

One waiter was very considerate to help me with carrying my stroller outside to street level, but sadly enough came to the conclusion that we are not going back again."}
{"text":"Coming from the Toronto/Markham area, I have very high expectations for AYCE Japanese restaurants in terms of quality, creativity of dishes, service, environment, etc. A friend recommended Sushi Crescent to me and I've got to say, I'm very, very impressed with all aspects of our lunch AYCE meal. 

We arrived at around 12:30pm on a Saturday and were pleasantly surprised that the place was already about a third to half full. Service was very quick and all the waitstaff were extremely polite, friendly, and always noticing empty water glasses, empty teapots, empty dishes, etc. The tea was a roasted rice tea, which was definitely a very nice change from the usual bland green tea at AYCE places. The menu itself wasn't that creative and didn't have too many options, but there was a fair selection of sushi, rolls, appetizers, small fried dishes, ramen/udon/fried rice. The only dessert they have are green tea, red bean and green tea ice cream, which is a bit disappointing. What I found great was that after you placed your order, you received a small checkbox sheet with what you had ordered. That way, you could be sure you received all the things you ordered and it definitely prevents you from over-ordering and wasting food afterwards.

Expectably, there was no sashimi on their lunch menu, it was $16.99 per person plus tax and tip which I'd say is a very reasonable price for the high quality and stellar service. There are 2-3 small outdoor patio tables (you'd have to bring your order inside to get it taken down), a large upstairs and front and small back room on the main floor. There's only 1 stall for the male and female washroom, so not the most convenient."}
{"text":"Really good sushi. Food comes pretty quickly. Took a couple requests to get a glass of wine. Their selection of Dragon rolls are really good and don't miss out on their mango pudding for dessert. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I went to Crescent Sushi along with a bunch of friends to celebrate one of my dear friend's B'Day and I must say that my culinary experience was fairly good. It seemed to be a busy Sunday afternoon but we were promptly shown a table for 6 upstairs. The food here is quite tasty and the prices are fairly inexpensive. 

We ordered an all you can eat buffet, also referred to as their Lunch special for $15 each and by the end of it the girls were talking about skipping dinner and burning extra calories (not me of-course) 

They do have a really good non-sushi selection but I have had better sushi in the city.   I do recommend to try out their spicy Salmon and Tempura."}
{"text":"Le service est très bien tout comme les sushis quand vous êtes dans le centre-ville et que vous ne voulez pas vous cassé la tête c'est une bonne place, propre et les ingrédients sont frais."}
{"text":"Despite all the negative reviews, my friends and I  came here on a random night because we were feeling AYCE sushi and it was right across the street from us. I was pleasantly surprised! Some rolls were definitely better than others. California roll was not good, but some of the special rolls were good! The seafood and sashimi were actually pretty fresh. Service was decent too."}
{"text":"Mediocre service:

Expect that they mess up your order 2-5 times per visit. Service is slow, except when they judge that you're about done, then they will rush to get you out.

Mediocre quality sushi, mediocre quality deep fried goods, low quality cooked dishes, abysmal quality soup or dry noodle and rice dishes.

Expect decent (salmon, eel) to almost inedible, rancid raw fish (\"tuna\", \"snapper\") . Better stick to cooked or deep fried stuff if you have weak stomach."}
{"text":"This is all you can eat

All.. ALL... you can eat

Seriously. 

And it's good. You'll have sushi coming out of your ears. 

It gathers quite a crowd on the door on weekends.

They sometimes get orders mixed up, but it's a minor issue.

And try the ice cream!"}
{"text":"A classic AYCE sushi spot for Montreal. 

Although definitely on the pricey side ($20 lunch and $35 dinner, after tax and tips), I would still recommend it for your sushi cravings (especially for raw fish) because of the quality. The sashimi simply look and taste fresh. 

Also, unlike other places where I found the salmon sashimi cut into tiny strips, Sushi Crescent give you them in nice big chunks. It's AYCE anyway, why so stingy? Details, details. And for this detail alone, I give Sushi Crescent thumbs up."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday lunch. It's a very nice venue inside, with fireplace decor, modern, and clean. Great variety. House salad was small, but delicious. Spicy salmon very good. Salmon belly - oily as expected, delicious meat when you get there, a bit fatty. Salmon head - low yield on meat. Ramen noodles were delicious. Dragon eye No 26 roll was awesome. Dragon roll No 28 was pretty good too. Tempuras were good. Fried scallop was average. Salmon rose No. 14 tasted good, but seemed to lack a layer compared to menu picture. 

Ice cream no. 148, all were good. Serivce was good.
 
15.99/adult, 12.99/seniors, all you can eat."}
{"text":"Out of all the 'all you can eat' sushi places in Montreal this is probably my favourite. You have a large selection of sushi as well as other options from the kitchen as well. The atmosphere is also pretty nice as well.

The reason why I am only giving it 3 stars how ever is I feel these places are taking away from a 'true' sushi experience. Though the sushi is okay tasting, they are very simple and seem rushed. I feel Montreal is lacking in authentic sushi restaurants and is just flooded with 'all you can eat' places."}
{"text":"This restaurant  has very authentic Japanese food. I recommend sushi & donburi.
There are a lot of choices on the menu.But only one has a problem,the food was great  but the hospitality could improve a little."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi for under $30 - not a bad deal! Before you read my review, understand that I am a foodie and I love great food. I am going to death this place on the quality of food compared with other sushi spots. The place itself and the staff were great - I would give them a 4. 

The food is decent. The crab is imitation, which already knocks a sushi place down a star in my book. I really enjoyed the spicy tempura shrimp roll. The pan fried dumplings were good as well. 

I love the concept and if you're looking for pretty standard sushi and super hungry where you can eat a lot, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Very good place and nice staff. Everyone tried to help even though we were there late at night before they closed. For a buffet they are great. Worth going there again."}
{"text":"This place is the worse. On my second visit to Montreal, my friend and I stopped here for some sushi. I would rate them lower if I could.

1. The biggest scam ever. You are there a LONG time to get your food. Because it is all you can eat, they take their time making you sushi and really, they take the time so you have an opportunity for your stomach to get full which makes you order less. I was there for over an hour for 15 rolls. First was one hand roll, 3 piece and a 4 piece roll. After half an hour I recieved another 3 roll and 4 rolls. Each sushi had more rice than the fish. 

2. They ordered the wrong item and after they corrected the slip, they still brought it out. If you don't finished you get charged. 

3. We may be tourists, but don't treat us like crap because you hate tourists. We decided  to tip the minimum due to BAD service. They just took the money and never gave us change. Nice.

Places like this pisses me off, we are supporting the business and instead of giving us the fundamentals of decent customer service,they treat you worse. They  didn't even look at us until we paid. Never again."}
{"text":"Dans une quête épique de recherche des pires resto à Montreal, On a trouvé ce bijou et s'est empressé d'y reserver. On a pas été deçu! Plancher collant a grandeur, service inexistant unilingue chinois, on s'est fait comprendre en pointant le menu. Impossible de se saouler la face là avec la vitesse que la bière arrive! La gang a bien apprécié les autocollants par dessus le menu qui clarifie que c'est effectivement une 'imitation' d'une viande quelquonce. Bref, vous voulez perdre un beau 25$, mettez le donc aux vidanges tant qu'a aller là. Will go again 5/5 much wow!"}
{"text":"Very bad experience, if u want to give your girlfriend a horrible surprise it is the best place . I never see a Japanese resto which is good at general Tao and waiting time is super long. I ordered 2 soup they only gave me one, when I asked the waitress on the 2nd floor, small Asian girl
, she said she couldn't control it. But you should know how to count! And then , she never filled my cup. Also, the space is very narrow, another customer passed by, dropped my food, I hadn't touched it yet. Finally I have to pay 10% tips, but I don't think that it deserve."}
{"text":"Love it here so much although always packed with customers. It's good tho, mostly good restaurants are heavy occupied. The menu is pretty awesome, all types of sushi, to beef steaks and my all time faves: tempuras & salmon belly! However they tend to put too much salt on the salmon belly, so you better tell them not to or ask tons of lemon"}
{"text":"I tried out this place after reading the good reviews on yelp while looking for an AYCE.

I was terribly dissappointed by everything at the restaurant. 

For starters, there was food under my chair that got onto my clothes which was absolutely disgusting. The food was poor quality; oily tempura, sloppy sushi rolls and undercooked spring rolls. The service was really brusque and would just run by dropping your plate as they continued along the way. 

When we went to pay, the woman at the cashier even reminded us that tip isn't included in the bill which I'm sure anyone from the continent is well aware of. A terrible business practice and also just plain rude!

Overall, I would really not recommend the restaurant. The food was terrible quality, the service was bad and the place wasn't too clean."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas ma succursale préférée malheureusement quand je la compare aux autres branches de Sushi Montréal.  

Le restaurant est très bien situé, en plein centre de Montréal, pas très loin de la station Guy Concordia et de la rue St-Catherine. Son emplacement lui vaut la plupart de ses clients à mon avis.

Le service n'est pas très efficace, il n'y a pas assez de serveur pour les rush qu'ils subissent durant tout le long de la journée. Du coup dès qu'il y a un peu de monde, tu attends 30-40 minutes pour recevoir ta commande. 

La décoration laisse à désirer, tout est en mauvaise état, déchiré, fissuré ou collant. Tu rentres dans le restaurant puis ça te prend une minutes avant de réaliser l'état des lieux.

Les sushis sont bons, comme dans toutes les succursales, mais je suis toujours déçu quand la salade de wakame arrive congelé et que la soupe miso est trop salé.

En bref, si vous désirez passer un bon repas, ne venez pas en fin de semaines, c'est bondé puis vous allez rester 3 heures."}
{"text":"Les sushis sont bons et le service est bien ! Le personnel est sympathique et le service est assez rapide ! L'endroit est chaleureux et c'est un restaurant \"all you can eat\". Le prix est très raisonnable. Allez-y sur l'heure du midi: c'est moins cher :)"}
{"text":"So surprised to read anything but 5-star reviews on this place.
I'm a die-hard Sushi Crescent fan and will defend it forever. All you can eat sushi is the best thing that has happened to man, and Sushi Crescent does a wonderful job of it. Having been to almost every other all you can eat sushi joint in Montreal and Vancouver, I can without a doubt say that this is by far the best. The service is so quick and my waiters have never been anything but friendly.
Onto the food..... delicious. amazing. mouth-watering. so good. 
I've had probably everything on the menu and I can't complain about one thing. On top of the sushi being consistently fresh and delicious, their other dishes like their chicken skewers, gyozas, and deserts are all equally delicious too.
I've been a regular at this place for a couple years now and won't be stopping soon."}
{"text":"This is always my first choice for all you can eat sushi. 
I have been here around ten times over the passing four years. I made nice memories with my friends and families who are no longer around me.
The service and food are both very decent here. I like Japanese teriyaki more than sushi, because I like meat more. I normally have a bowl of rice or noodle, shrimp tempura and sashimi (the sniper taste better than salmon) and much more teriyaki. The seaweed salad for starter is a must try if you don't hate seaweed. 
No debit card accept. only credit card."}
{"text":"I was super excited to come to an all you can eat sushi spot in montreal.
1. The waitor started speaking french without asking us what our language proference was especially when we looked confused i literally had to say english please.
2. The waitor than proceeded to tell us its all you can eat but you have to pay right away as its almost 3pm so the lunch price is almost over.
3. We said okay paid before being served even a drink.
I paid with credit the options to tip were 10 15 20% keep in mind tax is also already 15%  and we havnt been served yet. I pressed other so i could type my tip and the machine automatically tipped 18%. Hmmm 
4. My sister paid cash. We thought we would have to pay for our green tea later so she would tip when we paid for that. She left 21 dollars tip and the waitress who brought the machine to me said to her you know tip is not included it was SO rude. She didnt tip immediately but we didnt get a drink yet it was so backwards! It made us feel super uncomfortable so i explained she will tip when we buy our drinks..the waitress confused me more than said something was already included i thought she meant tip was so than i felt like i over tipped but no she meant the tea was already included in the 21 dollars so my sister was pretty much being asked for a tip.
I have never been anywhere that didnt serve you first and aftually get asked for a tip. Please remember im a good tipper and already tipped this was my sisters bill the lady wad discussing.
3. We found there was no sashimi on the lunch menu!!!+ whattttt! Sashimi is my fave ..so we picked a bunch of other stuff. All was subpar nothing special.
It took a while to get everything but not too bad.
Meanwhile the customers next to use were getting items they didnt order. 
This place charges for items that you dont finish eating.
Another couple of ladies walk in and were told their stoller will not fit in the restaraunt it has to be folded. Etc. Just really unpleasant and not accomodating. 
It was pretty crammed in the restaurant.
I dont think id come back

*please note there is sashimi but only on the dinner menu"}
{"text":"I really liked the food! At first I didn't really like the interior design but after I got the service and food, it was all covered very well!"}
{"text":"This has become my go-to ayce sushi restaurant for lunch (and sometimes dinner if I'm feeling lavish)

The atmosphere and price are the best compared to the nearby competition (k2, zushi, ste-catherine sushi); the decor and ambiance is really nice and relaxed

I find the service here is great, very cordial and fast. They've also rarely forgotten my order, if ever

The best items to get here IMO:
Salmon sashimi (dinner only)
Salmon teriyaki (BEST)
shrimp tempura
bbq eel sushi
spicy shrimp tempura roll
torched salmon sushi

I wouldn't recommend getting the specialty rolls, they put a lot of rice and they all taste bland to me while being quite filling (bad if you're going for pure volume lol), I'd recommend getting the stuff i listed above over!

Price: 8/10
Food: 7/10
Service: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 9/10"}
{"text":"I went on a late Sunday afternoon. Overall, sushi was very good and recommend all you can eat menu.

Though, they did not have any red tuna. Plus, no shredded crab meat for the salad. There is very limited saki. Plenty of wines.

Service was slow considering there were more workers than patrons.

So, overall nice place. If you're looking for more complete menu including saki this is not your place."}
{"text":"Not bad place 
Lot of choices
But sushi is ok not too great 
Ok for group

Fried foods are great.
Few dessert available (only ice cream with different flavor) but good enough"}
{"text":"The sushis were good for sure. The service was good too. It was almost the same price as sushi crystal. The ambiance was better and the food was same. Ice creams I did not like it."}
{"text":"Customer service: so bad!badddddddddddddsddddddd! She was so mad at me because I changed seats twice. What the hell, if this was in LA, no one would give you a crap about it since you had so many empty table. Wow... I start missing LA.
Food: not bad
Water: tap water ( I don't know how safe is Montreal tap water.)"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi I tried in mtl.
They give you a paper with whatever you ordered and you can ceck what they got and what is still missing. The food taste good and they get it fast. The place was fully packed and the service was great. The staff was so friendly and helpful and did I mention super fast? 
I recommend that place"}
{"text":"Super reasonable for all you can eat sushi! I really enjoyed this place, and they have so many choices. All you can eat also includes tempura, dessert, and teriyaki. The sushi was not amazing but for the price it was awesome and the ice cream (green tea or red bean) was particularly good. Be warned: they do charge for uneaten pieces though."}
{"text":"This could easily be a 4-5 starts review but they loose so many points on service..I wanted to give them a 2 star review but since I realized I do like the place...

So I love their food, I love the  all you can eat idea, the quality of the fish is great, the price is ok but the service...You always need to triple check your order since they always will forget a few items and it feels like they do in in-purpose  (I have been there 4 times already always the same issue). Maybe since its an all you can eat they want to forget the more expensive or harder to do items, hoping you will also forget and move one. 

So bottom line, good place but you must be patient. They also have other meal options but if some want to have \"all-you-can-eat\" every one has to do it.  Finally their Sake is very nice."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Nice little restaurant. It has a modern look to it and is pretty clean.

FOOD: Their food is good. I did find that they put way too much rice in the sushi. I'm assuming it's to fill you up as fast as possible. And they aren't happy with you when you try to pick some of the rice out and will tell you that you have to pay for it if you do... Old trick in the book unfortunately. I personally think that there are better buffet style sushi restaurants out there. However, I do like the fact that they offer torched salmon sushi at lunch time (which most restaurants do not offer).

PRICE: Standard prices across all all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants. Nothing special here.

SERVICE: It was ok. It wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Just finished our all-you-can-eat dinner here and I can sum up the place to disorganized service compensated by decent food.  As with any restaurant, efficiency and accuracy of service is a leading indicator of the success of the establishment and this place really struggled in this area.  On a relatively quiet Tuesday afternoon, with only a quarter of the second floor occupied, it took them more than 40 minutes to serve our food.  And some of that is sashimi which requires minimum preparation.  Not only was the food served unusually late, 4 of the items we ordered never came.  We had to ask the waiter to check their status, an hour later.  The place also charges all children regardless of age, and we had two 20-month old babies that were sufficiently charged, but not quite sufficiently fed as service was too slow.  Having eaten sushi in more than two dozen cities, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi handrolls and seaweeds. Excellent miso soup and tampuras. Avocado and Cali sushis are the best."}
{"text":"My absolute all time favorite place for all you can eat sushi in Montreal. They always have amazing, fresh, delicious food. Their sashimi is to DIE FOR (I know... how hard is it to screw up raw fish?!) 
You can always depend on this place whether you have a reservation or not. They don't have a max limit of one dessert per person which is really an upside (too many cheap all you can eat places in montreal). They bring food out in a timely manner, and have a good ratio of fish to rice. 

Everything is fresh and you definitely get what you pay for. I always recommend this place to both friends and family. Heads up; they only accept cash and credit cards, no debit! 

Must tries here: Salmon Sashimi, beef tataki  (beautifully grilled on the outside), the dragon eye roll, and the fish cakes."}
{"text":"Bouffe - décevant ! Je ne connais pas exactement la raison (j'aurais dû demander) mais la grande majorité des sushis été nappé d'une sauce sucrée du style teriyaki. Pourquoi masquer les nuances entre les variétés de sushi avec la même sauce partout ? En faisant ça, tout goûte pareil. J'ai dû commander 3 fois le même sushi avant de m'apercevoir que j'y avais goûté dans ma première commande. 

Service - médiocre ! Les commandes sont toutes mélangées, on reçoit la commande des tables voisines alors que cette table voisine a dû commander 3 fois avant de recevoir un plateau de sushi. Inacceptable. Une petite note,ne  vous fiez pas à la couleur des bouchons de sauce soya (vert étant généralement réduit en sel) la serveuse nous a confié que c'était toute la même affaire. Ils remplissent toutes les bouteilles avec la même sauce. Mentir au client, pas très bon !"}
{"text":"For all you can eat. This place is ok, but expensive for the quality. They have a big menu and offer a kitchen menu as well.

For all you can eat, the food quality is higher than average. The service was relatively quick as well and friendlier than most all you can eat sushi.

I ordered a ramen on the side, but instead of using ramen noodles, they used udon which was a big disappointment. If I were you, I wouldn't waste my time with anything but the sushi because for the most part it is an inaccurate approximation of Japanese food.

All you can eat is good for groups, but every time I go I am disappointed, and I would strongly recommend you go to a real sushi bar rather than an all you can eat place like this. You will be paying more for less food, but the quality will be much much better."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite all you can eat sushi in Montreal.

The restaurant is modern and cozy. The service is always fast and the place always seems busy. There is a large sushi selection and lots of non-sushi selections as well. The sushi has been fresh and tasty every time I've gone. If you're looking for an elegant, fast, delicious all you can eat sushi restaurant, look no further. My friends and I have always left here very satisfied."}
