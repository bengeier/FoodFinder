{"text":"The food was okay. I will not return, however. When I complained to the waitress that my wine was stale and vinegar-y, her reply was \"well, you shouldn't have ordered the cheapest one then\".  This has not happened frequently but when it has, a new glass has always been supplied immediately with a \"so sorry\"."}
{"text":"Great mussels, which is their specialty. Nice little restaurant for an intimate dinner that isn't dressy and all about the food!"}
{"text":"Great place. Spectacular Food. Tremendous and reasonably priced wine list. Perfect service and a dog friendly patio. Family owned. They treat guests like a happy family.   The food is truly wonderful!"}
{"text":"I met a  friend for lunch,the owner cook was 45 minutes late to open,I wish we had not waited we both ordered Mussels $18.00 a serving, I have to say they were  the worst I have ever eaten 1/3 did not open a few did not have any meat. The waitress asked how it was and we told her,absolutely nothing back from the cook/owner. The place has no lunch business and I do understand why."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Everyone was friendly. Services was a little slow, but friendly. The attention to details, from the cheap flatware, late delivery of a steak knife, to the unattended crumbs on the linen was bothersome. We ordered the Valentines $150 meal for two...the food was ok. She had oysters, very nice, but we longed for Cleo's... My snails were cooked well, but blah....She has Lobster that was tasty, and I had the Chateaubriand. Both were cooked well, but way underseasoned. We are still wondering why the white rice and green beans..on the plate. Yes, French country cooking, but made the whole experience stoggy and aesthetically off. Next Valentines, we'll go back to Elements and spend a little more for a quantum leap in fine dining."}
{"text":"French onion soup and the mussels were amazing. So full after these two appetizers we had to take the entrees home."}
{"text":"We sponsored a wine tasting at Viola . the restaurant was wonderful they brought in a wine rep they served us great wines and really good hors d'oeuvres for a good price . they were very friendly their service was excellent I would recommend it for a nice happy hour place and an evening out"}
{"text":"Went there last night, October 30.  Food and service were very good.  My wife left her purse behind after dinner.  We discovered this about 15 minutes after departing.  Called and they said it was there waiting for us, so we went back and picked it up.  All was well until we got home and had a chance to check out the purse.  All of her cash was missing.  Over $200.  Make your own decision."}
{"text":"My husband told me about this fantastic restaurant and finally he took me for my birthday. It was amazing! The onion soup was the best soup I ever had and it got better when I got my Brochettes de filet mignon, my husband got the Lamb with lots of flavor.  This is totally a 5 star place!"}
{"text":"I almost hate to let the world know about this hidden Scottsdale gem as I was getting used to there being only 5 or 6 tables full on my visits but this place is a DO NOT MISS. They have 4 different mussel preparations on the appetizer menu. Love the PASTIS (with it's subtle anise flavor). Mussels are outrageously plump and the bread is great for dipping. Meals range from filet mignon and rack of lamb to trout, salmon, sole, scallops and spaghetti.  Something for everyone.  Wine selection a bit limited but very good choices nonetheless. You need to visit Voila - you will want to return many times."}
{"text":"Great food and service as usual! Had the lamb and the clams and mussels and escargot. Everything was cooked to perfection! And the Michael Chapotier wine was perfect complement. We will of course be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch and dinner here a few times and always enjoyed it The French Onion soup is great and the quiche fantastic Small and comfortable.   Great wine selection  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch here with family. We were inspired to check out Voila by the recent glowing review in the AZ Republic and we were not disappointed!  The lunch menu was small but very well curated and the prix fixe lunch special was a great deal. There was also a fun mimosa special going and we all enjoyed a nice cocktail before lunch. The food was excellent - filling, authentic, and thoughtfully prepared. The service was attentive and the hosts were so very gracious and took extra time to explain the tradition around the King cakes they were baking for Epiphany.  A wonderful experience and I look forward to coming back again soon to explore the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"We came in for restaurant week, and will be back. The menu was excellent and service warm and friendly. Yeah, a bit heavy on the white hair crowd, but that is just fine with me. I am there to enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"We went to Voila few days ago with my friend and loved it. the New Chef Jean Christophe is a real executive chef , nothing to compare with the oe before . We loved our food, service was excellent We will be back for sure. I highly recommand the place  Congratulation to the 2 new Owners."}
{"text":"If you want a wonderful outdoor ambiance and great food this is the place! Try the Sole...delicious !"}
{"text":"A small French bistro - there aren't very many in town.   We have been here for lunch and dinner, including the all you can eat mussels on Saturday.   Excellent seasoned food and superb friendly service.   Mussels - provencales and mariners are both excellent.   The creme brûlée is one of the best - creamy and just the right caramelized top."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review and I had to do it for this great Scottsdale restaurant! They have a great happy hour and their house wine tastes amazing! Nothing like your Applebee's grape flavored vinegar. The food for the happy hour includes mussels and it's a heaping bowl of deliciousness. The calamari is perfectly fried, the caprese and bruschetta is also top notch! I even tried the escargot for the first time and was amazed by how delicious it was. The garlic and butter sauce was amazing.  It's an amazing French restaurant and more memorable than some of the restaurants I've been to in Paris. A must try!"}
{"text":"This place is such a gem! We came here on a whim while staying in the area, and were more than pleased. The mussels were ah-mazing, and the trout was too! The service was personal and attentive, Paul was a great waiter! Prices really weren't that much higher than your average Italian or upscale bar and grill. Make this a must if you're in the mood for wine and a classy meal."}
{"text":"Had the bouillabaisse ! It was so amazing...loaded with seafood. Can't wait o try the other specialties. Friendly cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bruschetta bread came out hard as a rock, asked for another and it was much better, thanks.  Also ordered the scallops that weren't anywhere near the quality of our first visit a couple if months ago.  Main course:  ordered salmon and it was raw.  I like my fish a little bit undercooked but again, it was raw. Asked to have it sent back and by this point it was our second dish sent back so we were beginning to feel a bit uncomfortable with our experience.  The waitress said that most people like it like that...just take it back will you?  It came back out 5 min later cooked, but by that point we were very turned off.    The $30 bottle of wine ($7 at total wine) we got was very good but we had to sit and wait 15 minutes with glasses empty for a refill.  We live right next door and we will NOT go back.  Edit: oh AND we went there specifically for mussels but they were out of all mussels on this Sunday night."}
{"text":"Thank you George and Charles for the fantastic dinner. Craving Bouillabaisse, it was time for us to go there again! We were due for a visit. What took us so long... not sure! We are due back because we need to get the mussels, again. Thank you for making us feel at home; food, wine, service... can't find anything to complain about. We will be back before the end of this month. Merci."}
{"text":"Just when we thought we'd found all the greatest French restaurants in town, we stopped in here on a whim and were blown away. Not only is it wonderful, it's easily the best French restaurant in the state and we have a new favorite, a new winner. It's authentic as can be - the food and the French experience - which is something no other place in the area has been able to do. My husband and I have been here at least five times since we discovered it in November or December 2015. Jean Christophe and Segolene are great people as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their bread and aioli sauce!! I've had many food items from their menu..and I still can't decide which one I love best."}
{"text":"A true French bistro thriving in the shadow of the mighty Goldie's.  Eggs Benedict were blanketed with the best (house made) Hollandaise ever. Voila makes French onion soup found only in France. Their mini quiche are outstanding. A Scottsdale gem."}
{"text":"What an outstanding experience!!!  This place is great!  We were greeted like special guests,  and felt that way throughout!  Our service was great,  food was unbelievable,  our entire experience here was wonderful!  Will definitely be back to try other menu items.  Thank you for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely meal. Excellent foie gras, traditional escargots and mussels marinières.  The chef's  wife indulged my attempt to speak French with her. Très charmante!  Highly recommend. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Viola French Bistro is a French gem.   We were transported back to France for an incredible four course dinner. The service, food, wine and ambience was delightful.  All dishes were perfectly seasoned and the product lived up to all of our expectations.  The pricing is a bargain for such high quality food and presentation.  If you want high quality French cuisine accompanied by a cozy setting and stellar service...then Viola French Bistro is for you."}
{"text":":( Check out my google review...they did not inform their social media channels about their month off in July!! I would a pic here if I could, maybe on Fb I will..."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place if you are a fan of French cuisine. The head chef is amazing and makes everything from scratch. Try this place out if you are ever in this part of town and craving real French food. Five stars."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Great to have an authentic French restaurant nearby.  The ambiance is relaxed and feels like a French bistro.  As to the service, it is typically French, meant to be leisure.  We've eaten there several times and enjoyed every one of our meals.  My husband loved the mussels, I am partial to their escargot.  The duck and coq-au-vin are excellent and to be recommended.  We're going again this evening and intend to order dishes we haven't tried before."}
{"text":"Voila is the creme de la creme! Located in the space formerly occupied by the Dragonfly Cafe, Voila is a neighborhood gem and bound to become a must-go restaurant once the word spreads. My friend and I arrived at 11 am on a weekday to find the doors locked, but the lovely woman inside explained that the web site was incorrect (they are going to fix it) and that if we didn't mind waiting until 11:30 when the kitchen opened, she would gladly seat us and get us something to drink.  Holey Moley! The coffee was divine! And it was brought with real cream in a creamer! What a treat! We were off to a great start!  The menu was chock full of choices as well as the blackboard that lists specials, soup and mussels. My dining companion and I had a difficult time deciding what to order . . . I could have ordered at least a dozen items.  We agreed to share the eggplant tart as an hors d'oeuvre. The puff pastry was so delicate, abundantly filled with eggplant, spinach and mozzerella and lightly topped with tomato sauce.  Heavenly! It was large enough to have as an entree for one!  Both of us were drawn to the mac and cheese with crawfish and the grilled brie sandwich, but we both opted for the mac (one with crawfish, one without as my dining companion is allergic).  What came to our table was two huge dishes of creamy, lightly browned mac and cheese, enough for at least four people! They do not skimp on anything here! Let me say that other than a mac and cheese that I once had at BItrot d'a Cote in Paris, this was hands down the best I have ever had . . . the perfect amount of cheese to pasta, the ideal amount of chunks of crawfish . . . each forkful so heavenly. But after five sumptuous bites, I had to put my fork down and have it packed to go . . . I shared it with a couple of friends that I visited on my way home and saved just enough to bring home to my hubby, who savored each bite and said we have to go back for dinner . . . ASAP!  While my friend and I lingered over the coffee, we couldn't help but notice that the restaurant was starting to fill up around 12:15 pm. One couple who came in said their favorite table was already occupied . . . by us!!!  We watched as heaping bowls of mussels  were delivered to almost every table around us. I can't wait to try them!  Our server (the woman who graciously opened for us) was attentive and friendly, and the kitchen staged the plating perfectly. And although the small dining room was getting very busy, we were not rushed at all.  What a delightful experience! I can't wait to go back for any meal, although I am very interested in their weekend breakfast (my favorite meal)! Voila . . . aptly named for this restaurant that just appeared by magic!"}
{"text":"two couples had dinner, Duck confit was authentic and quite good.Other dishes were average and not very French.  Service was below average. wine prices per bottle were much out of line and too expensive. \"French\" desserts were very disappointing and at $9 each very over priced. Souffle was beaten and toasted egg whites only and not real French souffle; Ill Flottante was not recognizable.  after this experience, i question the authenticity of  their claims to be French. Food average; wine good but overpriced desserts a scandal; service like any chain restaurant, but overall, no charm; nothing special after all.  Never again"}
{"text":"Service was very personable. Complimentary hot bread and garlic sauce are excellent. They offer four different types of mussels, which was a big hit with my boyfriend.  I had one of the specials - red snapper in a light and slightly spicy tomato broth - that was the best snapper I've ever had.  It was serve with buttery rice and garlicky french green beans.  The beans were perfectly crisp tender and very good, but between that and the garlic sauce for the bread I was tasting garlic until the next day.  That's the reason why I rated them 4 stars rather than 5 - plus I thought prices were a little high.  But we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant in scottsdale.  Upscale bistro, but with a casual feel.  Wine list may be smaller bit with very nice choices.  We had the salmon tartar and scallop starters which were amazing.  The muscles are fresh and delicous.  Also had one of the specials.  Highly recommend for everyone to give this place a try, you will not be dissapointed!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for my first visit. I enjoyed everything about this place. I had the escargot for starters. They were excellent made the traditional way.  Had the 3-course lunch special of the tomato-mozzarella, Bouchée à la reine, and creme brulee. All of these were delicious  Look forward to coming back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"the food was great,truly French But the service was deplorable,That waitress does not even belong to a dine in coffee shop. Must be friends with the owners."}
{"text":"Probably the best mussels I have EVER had...sheer perfection! They offer 4 different choices of preparation...I chose the white wine/garlic.  Their bread and dip was over the top yummy too! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food: -Ham/brie/tomato was just okay, I mean, it's exactly how it sounds, good salad on the side -Sweet potato fries were not made in house and were pretty much burnt -Crawfish mac and cheese was bland, texture of the macaroni was too mushy, only positive (depending on who you ask) was that it was a huge ass portion  Service, omg so fail: -One waitress running the small restaurant, didn't seem to know the menu at all, had no idea what gluten free meant, unable to give any recommendations, brought my friend and I both the wrong things, wtf  Aside from the small diversity my friend and I brought to the restaurant, the place was strangely filled with all old white women. Did we eat at a retirement community instead? That'd explain the (lack of) service and food quality."}
{"text":"We were so excited to be moving to a new home within walking distance of this French bistro. Three of us went there on Friday night at 6:00. Food was mediocre and not hot, service was horrible and both servers had attitude. Could have been regulars but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I've traveled extensively for business, and we've been vacation travelers most of our lives.  My wife and I had one of the best meals in memory - bordering on forever, at Voila Bistro. The Bouillabaisse was absolutely incredible with honest French bread and a perfectly-matched French White.   Best service in memory -   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine, she is French but lives here in Scottsdale, took me to this genuine French restaurant. I had the Quiche du jour and it was heavenly good! So happy to have found this place since I really have missed good food. I will be coming back a lot!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend last Friday evening. We specifically went to enjoy mussels and a glass of wine. I had modest expectations before going there... I sat at the small bar - charming! I was greeted by Paul who helped me pick a glass of wine. I always prefer a Cabernet. Oddly they were out of Cabernet...but as it turned out, Paul was helpful in leading me to a 2/3rds Merlot blend which I would never have tried otherwise - being a Cabernet drinker.   The wine was lovely. I actually had 2 glasses, as did my date. We shared the large mussels appetizer with tomatoes, saffron and garlic. Fabulous; we enjoyed every last one. There was a generous portion, with ho-hum bread made delicious by dredging it in the mussels sauce.  The pommes frites were fabulous.   The restaurant is small, charming, not pretentious. Its tucked in a corner and you have to look for it.  Later in the evening, we spoke later with ( I think) the owner - who is also the chef. French, funny and he enjoys his own cooking for sure...  No hesitation I would go back again. Great intimate charming place."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Wonderful . Had the escargot and then the quiche. Many many compliments to the chef and his charming wife. Will definitely be a returning patron."}
{"text":"Service is excellent, very personable. The opening bread and garlic sauce is amazing (secretly it's the best part)!! Atmosphere was pleasant and relaxed. Food is decent."}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight on 03/30/17. Both the service and meal were great. This is a four star restaurant. I'm not like some Yelpers who overrate everything.  Nice cozy atmosphere. You can talk and hear each other. We were quickly and graciously seated; Linen table cloths. Deanne was the server and she knew the menu and made appropriate recommendations. We ordered the French onion soup for two and a menu item, which we split. I'll definitely return.  Total without tip: $98.23. That included 2 glasses of wine."}
{"text":"Family lunch today with location chosen by my very picky uncle. He was correct that this restaurant is VERY good.  Had escargot and the quiche Lorraine which were both excellent. The snails were the perfect texture ie. not chewy nor mushy.  Quiche was slightly more creamy than expected but still light in body.     Wine list is perfect suited to the food and well curated.   Had the raspberry souffle for dessert which was INCREDIBLE.  Super light with complex flavors.   Service was perfect: just attentive enough.   Will go back."}
{"text":"I had the duck confeit. It was so amazing long prepared, perfectly cooked, my acquaintance was on a diet so I eat hers too. The crème brulee just arrived looking outstanding, pardon my quick exited review, I must indulged."}
{"text":"Was expecting more.  Service was very good!  One entree came undercooked and had to be returned.  One glass of wine was stale and had to be replaced with a freshly opened bottle.  Not sure I wolud go back at this point.  Dessert was very good. It is a cozy setting."}
{"text":"Simply the best in town. What an extraordinaire cuisine and service. You will not be disappointed. Le foie gras est à mourrir !!"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic.  Food, sevice and atmosphere are off the chart.  Just had dinner, the second time in the past week.  What a delightful little restaurant.   It's so nice to have an authentic French restaurant in our neighborhood. Very romantic.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Voila is an outstanding place to eat, love the food and the mood.  Eating on the patio in the evening is wonderful now that the weather has cooled down.  only issue is price.  \"$$\" is not accurrate... More like a low \"$$$\"... My wife and I ate there this week, Bill was $100 for two lower price main courses, a shared bowl of soup and 3 drinks... Food was outstanding but at those prices we can't go often..."}
{"text":"We live in New York City and found this charming spot on Yelp. Lovely restaurant owned by a couple who owned a restaurant in  France (just moved here 2 years ago), now in a non-descript Scottsdale mall, but an experience trés bon. We had the poisson soup, salad Nicoise and Poulet Basquaise. Everything was delicious. The warm bread with aioli was addictive. Personable service from the owner. Only thing I would criticize was the lighting - a bit too bright. But a really great spot for Francophiles with the video monitor playing picturesque scenes from France, nice French music, etc. The service in particular felt like we were back in the French countryside."}
{"text":"What can you say about a somewhat pricey restaurant where the food was ok and the waitress was rude to an 89 year old woman?"}
{"text":"I used to think there wasn't a decent place to eat on this side of town.  The food was incredible. We really enjoy French cuisine and this was on point.  The service was friendly, warm and efficient. The wine selection was excellent.  The bread they brought out in the beginning is perfectly crusty and soft in the middle and is served with some sort of garlic/rosemary/lemon mayo-- not particularly French but still super tasty.  My partner had the mussels. He said they were delicious  I had the chef menu($48): Asparagus, morels, house made puff pastry: This was incredible, I wasn't sure I even needed the entree- it was that good. The sauce made my toes curl.  I wasn't sure about how the asparagus and morels would be..I love the flavor combination but we are so out of season...I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.  Perfectly cooked and they tasted at the peak of season.  How they managed that i will never know.  Duck breast with foie gras sauce, roasted vegetable stack(onion, eggplant, zucc, tomato), herbed potatoes. The sauce was perfect and the veggies were the best(i'm a huge veggie lover).  I thought the breast was a little more done than I like and wished the skin could've been crisp. The flavor profile was still delicious.    Dessert: minis of creme brule, chocolate tart with creme anglaise, strawberries with caramel ice cream and choco drizzle.  So I was full...really full...we ate the entire thing.  So so so good.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There should be 10 starts for the chef and the staff!  This was our first visit and they made us feel like we were the only people in the place. The food was beyond exceptional as was the service  we hope you take this to heart and make a reservation for dinner.  We will be back many more times!"}
{"text":"Good service. Lamb shank special fell off the bone. Wine steward was from Paris and knew his wines.  Nice patio. Of course the evening was lovely."}
{"text":"Decided to try Voila again after swearing off it following some poor quality meals and service. Went in for a 6:30 pm reservation and got The last table outside. Unfortunately the last table inside was rather lopsided and we spent the night balancing our wineglasses and food so they didn't tip over into our laps.I have a hard time believing that the servers weren't aware of the difficulties with the table and perhaps they just enjoyed seeing the table seesaw back-and-forth but at no time did anyone offer us any assistance with the table.  The waiter brought us the wine list which is a board with written words on it noting the winds and the price for glass and bottle. I thought it was interesting that with a list of 20 wines he was specifically pushing the one that wasn't on the list but didn't offer us the price of that wine.we ended up ordering one glass of the special wine and another solving y'all Blanche I have to say that they were very poor quality.  To start we ordered a caprice a salad to split. When it arrived it look reasonably good but the tomatoes weresorely underripe and had little if any taste and we're hard to cut.  We order dinner of two grilled salmon with Dijon sauce and my wife asked if she could have the Dijon sauce on the side but was told that this was how the salmon was cooked.we went ahead with it figuring we would just move some of the soft off of her fish. It took about 40 minutes for two orders of salmon to come out and weren't we surprise when only one came.perhaps it was a language barrier simply the fact that the waiter was not paying attention to our order but we ended up sharing one order of salmon Dijon and one side because having experienced a long waits in the past I fear that if I asked for the second it would be morning before we were fed.  At no time during the dinner did anyone offer us any additional water and her glasses were so drive-by about midway through the meal that dust could have settled on them.   Despite the fact that we were sitting right by the door and the entrance to the restaurant getting our ways attention to be able to get our check was another challenge. We finally accosted one of the other service his arms were full of dishes to ask her for our check.  I had hoped that after a past experiences at Voilà that the service what is improved.unfortunately I found that to not be the case and the long waits for dinner made a simple meal out into a much longer experience. Had the ambience of the circumstances been improved perhaps this would not of been as bad. Finally, the meal wascharacterized by a heavy hand with garlic both on the vegetables as well as in the Dijon sauce and I could've shared with a bit more Dijon as opposed to spice."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this french restaurant, the food is amazing it makes me feel like Im back in France. This is a fantastic gem with owners who treats the customers as good as their attention to the food.I can't wait for the weekend to go back."}
{"text":"Here on a quiet Thursday (perhaps because it is early). Very good, very reasonably priced and excellent service. Fresh baguette right out of the oven, good escargot, and very flavorful duck confit."}
{"text":"The moment I walked into this bistro, I knew the cooking would be good because it simply smelled like Europe. And in a day when all of the good restaurants are owned by restaurant groups with larger than life marketing visions, it was incredibly refreshing to be in a quiet, authentic bistro atmosphere owned by a couple. It was hard to select from the menu, as everything sounded good. For those like me that love French food but aren't necessarily into frogs legs or snail, there's plenty to select from. Although they have those things too. The food exceeded my every expectation. I started with the \"cheese and crackers\" as an appetizer which was an elegant wood plate of French cheeses, meat, and crostini. I paired that with a Chardonnay which was delicious. If you love French wine as much as I do, you will love their huge French wine by the glass or bottle menu. For dinner, I had the lamb which was as tender as a filet mignon. Lamb is so hard to get right, and they nail it. I've never had such tender lamb, it was actually a little red in the middle. I am one of those people that never finishes her dinner but I gobbled this up lickety split. I had a red wine with the meal which brought out the flavors even more. For dessert, I had to try their creme brulee which of course, was amazing. And I had an espresso which was slightly creamy even though I didn't add cream. Yum. If you are looking for an authentic French dinner in a true bistro setting, you have to go to Viola! French Bistro and Wine."}
{"text":"Just excellent.  Lovely atmosphere, excellent service.  The food was outstanding, and the portions very generous.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Was there  yesterday,April 14 , dinner was delightful,George was helpful with drink and dinner, see you soon jack and Paula"}
{"text":"Given our love of France, we really wanted to love our dinner at Voila.  While enjoyable at times,  it came up short on a number of counts.  The outdoor patio was very pretty and private, recommended.  The bread was crusty and we liked the aioli.  Disappointing were the Mussels Marinieres.  We didn't expect a reprise of the wonderful mussels we enjoyed again and again in Normandy, but the broth lacked distinction.  My entrée, the Leg of Duck Confit, was good, but lacked richness.  The potato gratin and grilled zucchini, tomato and onion were both very good.  My wife was disappointed with her entrée , scallops over spinach in a heavy puff pastry.  The wines, while representative and enjoyable, were about 3x retail, and that's too expensive in my mind, especially for a Restaurant also billing itself as a Wine Bar.  Service was perfunctory, not especially warm, with the exception of the chef's wife who visited and was very sweet.  The chocolate tarte in a vanilla sauce was wonderful.   So, all in all, mixed feelings, and an overall sense of disappointment."}
{"text":"Love, love, love!!! Breakfast is the best I have ever had at a restaurant and eating dinner here makes me feel like I am back in France....I have not been for lunch (YET!) I can't wait to take my family and friends here! We happened to stumble in one morning looking for the restaurant that used to be there and what a surprise.  I had the crab cake omelet with their version of breakfast potatoes (which I couldn't stop eating) and a croissant with Nutella.   Any restaurant that serves Nutella is an A+ in my book :) We then went for dinner on NYE and had escargot, endive salad, roasted chicken and champaign.  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have had lunch twice at Voila since the owners changed. A French couple now run the restaurant. The wife takes care of the front of the house and husband cooks. She has a lovely personality and tries very hard to accommodate her guests. The decor is lovely with white table cloths and fresh flowers. There is a cozy patio on the side. We have been very pleased with the food both times. We have tried the mussels, croque monsieur, chicken in puff pastry, and a couple of salads. The wine list is good, and prices start at $10 per glass. I'm not sure if they have happy hour specials or some other special. It would be nice, though. We are looking forward to trying their dinner menu. Give this place a try if you haven't been there recently!"}
{"text":"Segolene was so sweet and took her time to explain everything to us and talk us through each of our selections.  Great find!!"}
{"text":"Why oh why was this my first time here? Perfect service, fantastic food and boom! Just like being in Nice... except better! Charcuterie was splendid, snails succulent and the creme brûlée   to die for! Thank you for a beautiful evening! Voila!"}
{"text":"Classic French bistro fare done very well.The chicken stew, scallops and the fois gras with apples and potatoes were awesome.A little short on the service end -understaffed. Wine pours were reasonable but cocktail pours were very light and pricey-very much like Paris."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Segolene and husband chef are just 6 months here from Franco. Lovely little lunch spot for glass of wine with mussels and Frits, or escargot or French onion soup but dinner looks to be the treat. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had a great evening at this neighborhood restaurant. If you've been to France you will feel the authenticity.  If you haven't, visit to understand the real thing.  Amazing husband/wife team hosts your evening. The mussels Provençal were a dream. Short wine list, but authentically French and quite accessible.  They shake a great martini.  Try this lovely place!!"}
{"text":"This place keeps improving though there was nothing wrong with it before. We came for lunch. We had a bottle of Chablis by Jadot. My wife had croque Madame and french fries, as usual. I decided to try something different and had the mussel appetizer (not to be confused with the mussel entree) and it was great.  I also had eggs bourguignon which I enjoyed. Both of these are appetizers. We had good service."}
{"text":"This is a French restaurant for people who don't know French food. We have eaten in French restaurants all over France, Montreal, New Orleans, Martinique, St Martin, etc and have NEVER had Bouillabaisse that did not include croutons and rouille. I didn't expect the broth to be served first, and the fish second, but I was shocked about the omission of the rouille. All the seafood was overcooked including the mussels in snali butter and the scallops on the shell. These are not complicated dishes so it was a disappointing experience. On the plus side; service was impeccable, the wine menu was wonderfully illustrated and educational and the foie gras over fingerling potatoes was the hit of the evening."}
{"text":"Great Food, great Staff, great prices! Met the owners, Chef Jean Christoph is an excellent cook and his wife is an amazing Host! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"New owners same wonderful food. Great night for a glass of wine and a bowl of excellent onion soupy he new owners have developed and expanded the menu.  Our meals, while definitely prepared in a French manner, were unique and wonderfully tasty. The wine list has also improved  They again open for lunch come 06 September  Back for lunch today with my wife Margaret  They have a lovely lunch menu - varied with a number of interesting options. A lovely holiday menu; better than expected Somehow the onion soup has improved - now my #1 onion soup   Lovely restaurant; lovely people We are fortunate to have such neighbors   Company Happy New Year lunch today  Wonderful hospitality; same wonderful food  Gotta love that onion soup!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at the recommendation of a friend. We did not have a reservation on Saturday night but they let us take a table when we promised to be out before the reservation so we had about an hour. I ordered scallops in puff pastry, my wife had the chicken. Great little bistro with the warmth only family ownership can provide. Crisp salad, delicious entrees, and the best surprise was the soufflé. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great dinner with a group of friends eager to try some French cuisine. We all enjoyed out menu selections with of course some glasses of wine. A lot of our friends are going to be returned customers.... Bravo to Jean Christophe and Segolene for creating this French Bistrot ambiance to keep our French roots alive by reminding us what an excellent dinner with good friends can be just like in France ....  Well done!"}
{"text":"Our group of 6 enjoyed a nice dinner at Voila.  The food was either good or very good.  My dish was Branzino fish with vegetables and it was good.  My wife ordered the cod w hollandaise sauce and she said it was excellent.  For desert I ordered the creme Brule and it was excellent."}
{"text":"We came to Voilà this past Saturday thanks to a Groupon we received at Christmas.   We were seated outside in the patio area, with our own personal heater no less. Our server Jordan was great and was from Michigan as we found out. We chatted for a while and then he was off to get a glass of Pouilly-Fuissé. And that, was just about when the wheels started falling off our romantic evening here.   Voilà owner/Chef Georges came outside to yell at some neighborhood kids who were skateboarding a little too close to his patio. No one at Goldie's next door seemed to mind. But between his high pitched whistling and yelling, it made us think of that Seinfeld episode. You know the one.  Don't get me wrong, a little drama can be fun. But we just kept our heads down, as Elaine did. Thankfully it worked. Our appetizers arrived just in time and he went back into the kitchen. Voilà!  Let me say that we loved Voilà's wine list. It's been a while since we had a good Pouilly-Fuissé.  It was complex, with a nice fresh taste. A wonderful change from the American Chardonnays we've been drinking. It was moderately priced at $16 a glass (Louis Jadot normally goes for $30 a bottle).  We started off by ordering the Escargot ($12.00) and the L'oignon Soup ($9.00). The escargot was delicious, with just the right amount of garlic. As for the soup? Sadly it was very bland, with no beef stock taste and so salty, we couldn't finish it.   For our entrée, we ordered the Sea Bass Brazino ($29.00) and the Beef Bourgogne ($32.00). The fish was describe as a \"Blackened Cajun Style\". It tasted like it was seasoned with ton of Lawry's Salt, I would guess a tablespoon. There was no Cajun spice or kick, I picked at it but couldn't finish it. The beef was somewhat better, but it too was way over the top salty. It had a beef bouillon like taste, with no vegetables or potatoes.   Now we love French food and always look forward to visiting our relatives in France. If you like Voilà, I would suggest you try Coup des Tartes, St Francis, Zinc Bistro, Chez Vous Crepes, Cafe Paris French Bistro and then tell me what you think.   The damage came to a very reasonable $103.00, before taxes, gratuities and our $40.00 Groupon.  So unless you like your food very salty, I would skip Voilà.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"The owner is extremely rude and yelled at my wife and kids as they were leaving Goldie's next door saying they were being too loud.  I've seen him him complain several other times about kids being in that shopping center.  I will never eat at Voila because of the owner's poor behavior and the way he treated my wife and kids."}
{"text":"We went with another couple last week and were hoping to have a great meal since we all live nearby and enjoy French food. We were seated at a small round table that would never be considered a four top in other restaurants, even though larger tables were empty. We ordered mussels to share, onion soups, wines by the glass, some red some white, two orders of scallops in puff pastry and two orders of bouillabaisse. A lot of food for a tiny table. The mussels were good, but nothing special, the onion soup was ok, far from the best we ever had, and the scallops, though cooked well were not in as described in puff pastry, but sandwiched napoleon style. The biggest issue was the  bouillabaisse. Our friend requested no calamari in his. The server said ok, and when she bought the dishes she placed them in front of each diner. After a few tastes our friend realized his dish had calamari and summoned the server. My husband realized his dish did not have any calamari. The server acknowledged the mistake but made no offer to correct it. Fortunately it was a food dislike and not a food allergy issue. However, my husband likes calamari, and did not get any. At $45 for a bowl of bouillabaisse that is inexcusable. The server never offered to bring  him a side of calamari, a refill of wine, or a complimentary dessert.  Though the food was worth going back for, the service was so disappointing and it is clear that the staff is not looking for repeat customers"}
{"text":"Quaint place but a little hard to find. We sat outside under a heater and felt like we were in a French Bistro in Paris. The music was excellent and not too loud.  I like that the menu was simple and not over abundant. Ordered a bottle of Pinot noir and relaxed with a glass before ordering. Ordered an appetizer and French onion soup to split. Best French onion soup I've ever had. No salty just perfection.  My wife had the muscles in white wine garlic and they were abundant. I had the duck in orange sauce. Both were excellent. The duck just fell off the bone.  Had expresso and they comped us a desert for our anniversary.  Outstanding night. We were not rushed and enjoyed a 2 hour dinner.  Looking forward to going back. Scottsdale needed a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"Came to this place on a Wednesday night around 6pm with a reservation. There were a couple of diners outside, and as the weather was nice, we also chose to sit outside. The hostess was very polite and friendly, and took care of us promptly, seating us with menus and glasses of water.  We decided on the foie gras and poulet basquaise.  The hostess brought us complimentary bread with some dip that was creamy and looked like mayonnaise but tasted a bit cheesy. The bread was hot and had good texture.  Our mains were served shortly after. The chicken looked almost like an Asian stir fry, and tasted similar to one too. It was served in a red sauce that was a bit oily, but peppery and delicious. The chicken was cooked just the right amount, and was moist and tender.  The foie gras came in two slices, atop of small pieces of poached apple, sliced roasted potatoes, and a rich, translucent brown sauce. The foie gras was perfectly complemented by the apples, and was scrumptious when paired with the rich sauce. Both my boyfriend and I enjoyed our meals and would definitely return when back in Scottsdale. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Definitely an older, locals hangout, but they truly welcomed us and made us feel at home.  The bartender was great...had many of the same interests, so talked about food for over an hour.  Great, neighborhood place to enjoy a bite to eat and a nicely selected glass of wine."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome ambience. Quite the hidden jewel from the bulk crowded spots in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The menu was a little more limited than I would have liked.  I suspect many of the dishes on it are excellent, the one I ordered was less so.  I loved the closeness of the interior and, on a cooler evening, the outside seating looks very inviting.    For appetizers the mussels were excellent, the escargot only so-so.  For dessert, what's not to like about creme brulee?"}
{"text":"We loved this place.  The service and good were excellent.  We had the Escargot as an appetizer.  My wife had the bouillabaisse special and I had fish with seafood.  Great French wine selection.  The wife of the owner waited on us and she was very attentive and helped us with our choices.  Everything made from scratch.  Highly recommend for a change of cuisine."}
{"text":"Was so disappointed in our meal here recently. My wife and I came in around 6pm on a Monday, and our first clue that it would not be a great dinner was that the place was empty.   We both started with the french onion soup. The soup tasted extremely bitter, it was almost inedible. The stock was extremely watery.   My wife the filet mignon and I got the rack of lamb. The filet (from the best I can tell) was butterflied, and resulted in it looking like salisbury steak. She ordered it medium rare, and it was cooked medium-medium well throughout. My rack of lamb was completely over seasoned, almost completely covered with herbs. I ordered it medium-rare, and mine was extremely overcooked as well with not even any pink. The worst part of the meal was that both of the entrees were served with what appeared to be frozen french fries. For $30+ an entree, french fries should never be served, especially ones that taste like they were frozen out of the bag.  It took almost an hour to receive our entrees when the restaurant was completely empty. I let the waitress know that our food was overcooked and she basically gave me the \"oh well, you should have let me known\" but did nothing to remedy the situation. Our bill came out to over $100 for two, and the food was bad, at best.  All in all, we will not be back here, and I would recommend that anyone who enjoys real french food to avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a find! Steve and I had our first experience last night... it was wonderful!  Atmosphere is charming with soft  French cafe music in the background... Deanna recommended  a wonderful Bordeaux (St Andre Corbin) I had two glasses...  Charcuterie board - chorizo was perfectly spicy and balanced with the lovely goat cheese...  Onion soup- the real deal.... an soo tasty  Escargot- (Steve) not a drop left... and one of the best he had had in a long while... he even scraped the top of the dish clean with their amazing BREAD...  from there we moved straight to dessert...  Vanilla Soufflé with Raspberries- when my fork pierced the perfect dome- fresh vanilla bean steam made my mouth water.  It was PERFECT....  Creme Brûlée - again... perfection.   Eating a meal made with love and passion and the highest quality ingredients is like no other.   Segolene and Georges have nailed it...  We are headed back this evening for another round...."}
{"text":"What a lovely little gem tucked into a retail center on Via Linda in Scottsdale.  Dinner was fabulous - beautifully prepared French cuisine and a comfortable, yet elegant setting.  I ordered the branzino with mussels, clams and a saffron sauce that I wanted to lick off the plate (but didn't!) and my husband had the almond trout...which I also wanted to eat after a taste.  We shared a generous asparagus salad, a wonderful bottle of French white wine and a Madagascar vanilla creme brûlée. The server and one of the owners stopped by several times to chat and make sure we had everything we needed and made our experience relaxed and memorable. We will definitely be back and look forward to enjoying the patio once the weather warms again."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place, but there were a few things that kept me from loving it.  My friend and I found this place through yelp, and were specifically looking for a happy hour place. Outside Voila's front door there was a sign that said that they had happy hour specials from 4pm-6pm, and we arrived at 4:15pm and found that their front door was locked.  Hmph.  We were peering into the restaurant when an employee of the restaurant came up from behind us and told us that the restaurant doesn't open until 5pm.  He then offered to let us in so we could wait around for 45 minutes for the servers to arrive??  We politely declined this bizarre offer and decided to go to Goldie's next door.  At 5pm we returned, and ended up ordering two glasses of house red and a large moules frites to share.  The food was delicious, and the wine was very tasty."}
{"text":"The mussels were tasty, the duck was scrumptious, and the raspberry soufflé was perfection. The service was slower than what were are used to, but if you're the type of person who dislikes when the waiter interrupts too often to ask \"how's the food??\" while you're mid-chew, then this is the place for you.   The setting is cozy, but if you are trying to have a private or romantic dinner with a significant other, a table on the outside patio is not a good idea. There is a big sports bar next to the restaurant and the second story had a loudspeaker broadcasting the games. It overpowers the restaurant's own soft music and kind of ruins the romantic ambiance of a cozy French restaurant.   Overall, I fell in love with the food, but not so much with the setting. Would I come back for more of that raspberry soufflé? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Having been there over the years, visited last Thursday. What  a great meal as well as service. We are looking forward to a great session!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined here numerous times and this is definitely one of our favorite date night places. The food is exceptional and the owner and wait staff excellent."}
{"text":"PARIS in Scottsdale! All I can say is \"MAGNIFIQUE\"! We went there last night with a groupon. The service was excellent from start to finish! The food was excellent. The warm fresh bread with the creamy garlic aioli sauce was to die for. I couldn't stop eating it. We also had the mushroom tart appetizer which was really good. OHHH..the sole and the mussels were my favorite. Mmmmm...then the bread pudding. Everything in here reminded me of when I was in Paris. I am definitely coming back to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"One of the greatest steak dinners and wine selection I have seen outside of Europe. Super romantic and would be great for a date with your significant other.   Staff was so kind and explained any questions we had about the menu, and had some wonderful suggestions! The fresh bread they bring out before the meal is also magnificent. Would recommend to anyone who wants to bring their significant other or someone special out for a beautiful meal and atmosphere.   Will be visiting every time I come back!"}
{"text":"Started out for lunch at Goldie's next door and somehow ended up with brunch at Voila!  What a great change of plans!  We both had quiche (mine Lorraine, his salmon)...rich, buttery, perfect!  The salad was a nice accompaniment to balance it out.  Service was a bit slow, but that's a plus when you eat with my husband.  Everything becomes fast food.  Are you done?  Are you done?  Uh, no, if I'm still chewing, chances are good I am NOT done.  They also have a nice little patio, but really, that's not much of a draw for the next 4 months.  Their dinner menu looks promising as well...I saw scallops and puffed pastry mentioned.  The rest was a blur."}
{"text":"I've been dining at this establishment for a long time. The food is always fabulous and the service will far exceed your expectations. You won't be disappointed. Fresh seafood and fish selections and French dishes to choose from. Pair a wine and finish with a delicious dessert and you leave completely satisfied! Thank you George for bringing a French taste to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot with on point French classics. Madame patron and the chef husband/ chef made my friend's birthday brunch lovely ! Sit in the patio for sure especially if it's a nice day."}
{"text":"Enjoyable place!  Owners are wonderful and food was great.  Glad we found this little gem when in from out of town."}
{"text":"This is a delightful French restaurant.  The interior is intimate and attractive.  The husband/wife team are engaging and sweet.  I ordered the steak and frites which were done perfectly.  I love the French portions--not too big or small. The pepper sauce was perfect and the steak was soft, flavorful and moist.  The fries were some of the best I have had.  When I asked for bread, the waitress said it would take about 10 minutes because they bake it fresh in the oven.  I said don't worry about it and a few minutes later she came out with some toast to satisfy my bread craving.  Afterwards I had the creme brulee and an espresso and again both were excellent.  If you have a craving for some of the foods you probably eat anyway but you want it prepared the way the French do, come here.  You'll hear only french music and the entire experience captures a bit of France in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Small family owned and operated authentic French Bistro with authentic and excellent French food.  Owner/chef with thirty years culinary experience in France before opening this bistro with his wife in Scottsdale. Very friendly and personal attention which adds to the experience.  Very nice people. Frank S."}
{"text":"Food was good but very pricey. Having lived in Paris I was hoping for a more authentic experience. Wine list was great and atmosphere was nice. Would recommend for a very special occasion for 2 anymore and your bill will be silly."}
{"text":"A charming delightful French bistro. There is limited seating inside.however a nice outside patio weather permitting. A French couple bought from another Frenchmen and it has been a nice transition. This new couple, he handles the kitchen and madame runs the front of the house. She also serves tables with another server. They all do a great job. They make the customer feel welcome.the kitchen delivers the food in a timely fashion.  The previous owner had a more diverse menu. He served Coq a vin, lamblc hops, steak frites,bouillabaisse,veal Cassoulet,filet of Salmon and tartares for apps.  So what we now have is a limited menu that they do things very well.  I I suggest adding some of these classics for the coming season."}
{"text":"Having come from NY with a love of French food, Az has been disappointing until now. Absolutely loved this quaint French restaurant with it's classic French menu. The food was nothing short of delish, the service attentive & engaging, the ambiance delightful & the best souffle we've had out here. This is a wonderful find and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Lovely bistro in Scottsdale. Since the new owner Jean Christophe, I frequent here for nice casual French food. I used to come here from time to time under George but his food started slipping, I enjoyed chatting with him but towards the end, it wasn't what it used to be and I quit coming.  I saw about the new owner and finally came back to try here again. I've been back a few times since then, that's how much I enjoy their food. Remind of me of all the places I went in Lyon.  Some of my favorite appetizers are Escargot, French onion soup, and steamed mussels. For main, I like their lamb, duck and scallops. Oh don't forget their foie gras, very good.  If you have both appetizer and main, free desert with Yelp check in.  I took advantage of that and enjoyed their not too sweet, just right amount of sweetness desert.   Small dining area both inside and patio. They also have some bar counters. I saw one gentleman dining alone at the bar once, and I thought I could do that too.    As long as you go early, reservation is not required but they do get quite full during peak dinner time. Easy to make a quick reservation from Yelp app.  It's a true bistro where a husband cooks and wife serves in a dining area. Casual yet elegantly presented dish. Always have lovely time here. Can't wait to go back for more great food"}
{"text":"Their blue cheese mussels are outstanding.  The tomato soup was so-so.  I'd like to come back for dinner and check out their specials and have a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"What a cute, quaint little place. It is located in the DC Ranch area, tucked away in the shopping plaza. If you blink you will miss it because it really is tucked away. The set up is really nice, tight but nice. I was here for lunch so I can imagine how romantic it may be for dinner. The food was delicious. We had some of the best calamari I have had in a long time and my coworkers raved over the french onion soup. I ordered the brie, ham, pesto and tomato sandwich (hold the tomato) it was was melty, cheesy, goodness. I was so full from all the calamari that sadly I couldn't finish it all but I did take it home and it was even good cold. All in all a cute place that I look forward to trying again for dinner."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal last night at Voila! Everything was fresh, hot and delicious! The artichoke salad was so different and tasty. The beef bourgeon was hearty and so full of flavor. The St. Jaques was unbelievable. Have to have the creme brûlée - great finish to a wonderful meal. Ambience is like you just stepped into a French bistro. The service is impeccable! This is a well kept secret! Spread the word!"}
{"text":"Went in late on a Saturday evening just wanting to split a dish because it was 8:30pm the service was excellent and the food was so delicious. We split the salmon crepes that all i can say is it's a must try!! The ambience was quaint and we loved that the chef came out to ask how we liked our meal which was a nice touch.  We will be back and look forward to trying some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is the best French Restaurant in the valley! The food is always presented beautifully and is always amazing! Love the ambiance. We have been there probably a dozen times. If the weather is nice, the outside seating is very pretty too. They have a good wine list with a nice variety. We skipped desert last night, but everything we've ever had before has been outstanding! Make your reservations today!"}
{"text":"Perfect date night atmosphere.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Their 3 course special was a hit for us at $42 for duck, soup, dessert. The menu was exactly as advertised on yelp, which is one of my pet peeves. So one point for that alone! We ordered the French onion soup. Nice broth great cheese and the same yummy bread from the table.  Needed a bit of salt to reach my expectations.  Escargot was a bit disappointing after the delicious aioli they brought for the bread.  Garlic flavor though advertised was very sparse.  Asparagus and shrimp soup was quite tasty when we added salt.  I'd order it again.  The nicoise salad was fresh with a great dressing.  The tuna was not fresh medium rare as we expected.  But the menu did not advertise that! Our bad.  Salt helped the salad too.  My duck special was wonderful great flavors and medium rare breast meat with comfe' leg meat.  More broth would have put it over the top to perfection, oh and I did add a bit of salt.  The scallops in puff pastry made my husband start planning our next trip there, after adding a bit of salt.  The beef bourguignon was the best I have eaten.  I have been to James beard award winners and Michelin star winners.  Perfect, no salt needed.  The souffle was perfectly prepared had great flavors.  Crème Brulee was on par not outstanding.  Vanilla sugar or more bean flavor would be a nice addition.  We are not table salting people I trust the chef's vision and don't want to overpower any subtleties they have in mind, and we added salt to most items.  So don't be shy after your first taste to grab the shaker and this may be your favorite place."}
{"text":"My partner & I had lunch at Voila for Valentine's Day and had a wonderful experience. It's a warm, cozy atmosphere coupled with well paced & pleasant service. The menu is small, simple with a special 3 course price fixe for the day. Good selection of wines by the glass. We started with the onion soup & the crab salad - both good sizes with very good taste. Our entrees, Croque Monsieur & steak frites were the perfect size full of incredible flavor. The 'frites' were amazingly simple yet incredible. Too stuffed for dessert but we will be back for dinner. Definitely a 'go to' spot for a good meal."}
{"text":"Totally recommend! Warm bread with amazing garlic aioli to start. Authentic French flavors and tastes. Love this place!"}
{"text":"What a great dinner Last week with Jean Christophe (pictured) and his amazing wife Segolene! The bread and butter cream sauce was so enticing - and for dinner I had the FDB \"French Duck Burger\" yep that's right and it was worth every penny!!!!! Oh and just a little wine plug \"the clos du bois RSV Cabernet was amazing"}
{"text":"Went here for our Valentine lunch.  Lovely French Bistro with a wonderful ambience.  Run by a French husband and wife where the service was excellent and the food authentic.  I highly recommend this French restaurant.  I have lived in France with my French husband and frequently miss authentic French food.  We had moule/frites that was very good.  The moule are a bit bigger than the ones in France, so the taste is a bit different but they were delicious and the frites were perfect.  One thing though, I wish they had served bread....always good for dipping in the sauce!!!  Had creme brûlée for dessert that was amazing!  Highly recommend this bistro."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and the Sole Meunière and the mussels with garlic and white wine are the best dishes! The Sole Meunière is a buttery light flavorful fish. The owner and our waitress were incredibly nice. It was my dad's birthday and they sang and gave him and wonderful dessert on the house. The best desserts are the apple tart tatin and the bread pudding."}
{"text":"Excellent sea bass with peppers and onions cooked in foil just right. Great mussels also. Very French menu but not classic with the heavy sauces. Wonderful vanilla and chocolate souffle for dessert. I will be back."}
{"text":"Both the food and the service are excellent. A great find for us today. Tablecloths, French music in the background - - just lovely Mussels were excellent - not heavy yet broth rich with chopped vegetables. Bread served fresh and hot. Very nice and educational wine list - all reasonable. Tucked in the back of a shopping center - so may be difficult to find."}
{"text":"Wow! What a wonderful place to eat. Small but quaint, the atmosphere is warm, inviting, and intimate. The service is excellent, but the food is the star of the show.  I cannot pretend like I know how to spell the French food I ate, and French cuisine is not my forte by any means, but I do know the 3 course meal I had here was amazing. Filling but light, you'll want to order ten more of whatever is in front of you. And for the love of all that is holy, ORDER DESSERT! You will NOT regret it! I wanted to bathe in the strawberry mousse while showering myself in the chocolate tart.   Prepare to drop a pretty penny, but it is a wonderful spot to have a romantic date. The food and atmosphere are worth it."}
{"text":"The first two times I went here the food was amazing!  However, I went back and while the service was great--Paris is awesome--the food was just ok!  I'm going to give it one more chance because Paris is an awesome bartender!  The owner, George, is a Hoot!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointment.  I read all the great reviews and we were really looking forward to it.  It started with our server who took a very long time until she made it to our table for our drink and dinner order.  Our appetizers were ok and came out quickly.  The foie gras pate had too much salt on the plate and the sauce was dried on the escargot.  Nothing left to dip bread in.  The really problem came when they forgot our entrees and we saw other people who ordered after us being served their entrees first.  The server apologized and explained they had someone new in the kitchen.  It would have been ok if the entrees were not overcooked.  The branzino was sent back because it was too dry to eat.  Also it seemed like the vegetables served with it were previously frozen or overcooked.  My husband ate his lamb even though it was overcooked (medium well).  Also I do not understand why we were not given fresh cutlery after the appetizers.  We have been to many french restaurants on the east coast (and in France) and this did not compare which made me sad since I was looking forward to having a french restaurant nearby.  After we paid and left the restaurant the owner ran after us to apologize and offer us two glasses of champagne when we return.  Unfortunately for the prices they charge it was too little too late."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this charming neighborhood French bistro. The staff was friendly and attentive. My husband and I ordered the mussels and crab salad to share. A side of bread would have been a great addition to soak up the broth of the mussels. For dessert, I ordered a chocolate crepe. The whipped cream and ice cream were not necessary for my tastes, as I was most interested in the house made crepe. On future visits, I hope to see savory crepes and omelets on the menu, like you would see on a bistro menu in France. We enjoyed our lunch and look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic French restaurant and wine bar with traditional dishes that reminded me of the time I used to live in Europe.  A large group of us went for dinner last Tuesday night after a work meeting and were the only guests seated inside, so it was nice that the restaurant wasn't too crowded.  I think because it was warm that night, most of the other guests sat outside.    I had a very sweet Chardonnay that was delicious, as I don't like very dry wine.  The steamed mussels in garlic, shallots and white wine paired very well with fresh, crusty French bread, and the bread also came with some kind of white spread (was it garlic sauce?) that I wasn't quite sure what it was.    So many delectable entrees to choose from, it was difficult to decide.  I finally went with scallops in puff pastry, and it didn't disappoint.  The scallops were huge, succulent, and sweet.  They came four on a bed of cooked spinach, all folded into a gigantic puff pastry.  Very delicious and hit the spot.  The presentation of my dish was also very pretty.    My manager kept talking about how wonderful soufflé is, and we were excited to see both vanilla-raspberry and vanilla-chocolate on the menu.  I had never tried soufflé before, but alas, we were too stuffed to order any dessert.  The owner was very friendly and provided excellent service in addition to the fantastic food.  Definitely a lovely place for a classy French meal!"}
{"text":"Yelp informed me of this new bistro opening up so I filed it away to try. Luckily, my husband and I were able to go for lunch recently and were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is tucked away in this overly large plaza filled with an AJ's and other restaurants. The outside isn't much, but the inside is cute and seems spacious. There were few patrons when we first arrived, but as the lunch hour continued it filled up rather quickly. However, we were the youngest people here! Even the wait staff was at least 20 years older than us.   Our waiter was nice and explained the day's specials. I order the French Onion Soup and the Quiche of the day. (Mushrooms and spinach - yum!) My husband ordered the steak but was informed they were out, so he switched to pork. My soup came up first and it was delicious. The cheese on top was super hot and still bubbling - fresh from the oven. Both of us really enjoyed the soup - one of the best French Onion soups we've had. After finishing the soup, our entrees came. My quiche came with a small side salad which had a really good house dressing. The quiche was also silky and flavorful. I don't normally enjoy crust, but this crust was rather good. My husband was surprised when instead of pork, his original order of steak come out! It wasn't cooked medium-rare, as he had ordered, but the flavor was still good.   Overall, it was a good experience. It took a little longer for our food to arrive than we had expected, but everything was tasty. We'd like to come back and try some more items!"}
{"text":"The Best mussels I've had in the desert in my 30 year here in Scottsdale fantastic service is great I highly recommend this restaurant I'm from Seattle and I am accustomed to fresh mussels and these were the best I've had here in az.   You'll be doing yourself an extreme disservice if you don't try this restaurant right away"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dining experience at Voila.  It started with our hostess, who was very friendly and accommodating. We chose to sit on the outdoor patio and had a wonderful table that was tucked away. The bread and dip are excellent! Took a lot of willpower on my part to not have too much. I had the Grilled Salman which was cooked to perfection! Presentation was lovely.  Our server was attentive but not overbearing.  He even brought us complimentary coffee after our meal. If you are looking for somewhere with great service from start to finish and high quality thoughtfully prepared food Voila is the place for you!"}
{"text":"We are fortunate to live just a couple moments away, but now that I have experienced it I would gladly drive across town for the food. My wife and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for a glass of wine and we hoped some small bites of appetizers. The kitchen hadn't opened yet but we decided to enjoy our wine at the bar and learn about the place. After a few moments, there are some wonderful olives that the chef brought out to us.  We asked for some bread and then the owner sat at a chair and we had a wonderful hour. We made reservations to come back on Monday night for dinner.  We are so glad that we did.  The salad was superb.  My wife got the mussels in an excellent wine sauce. The garlic butter for the bread was just as appealing as it had been on Saturday.  I ordered Steak Poivre, one of my favorites and truly one of the tenderest and most flavorful steaks I have eaten.  My wife had the rack of lamb.  Charred perfectly, tender and the bite she was willing to share with me was incredible.  I agree with one of the earlier reviewers, you may be lucky to get a reservation in this place in three months.  Go now."}
{"text":"After a 2nd meal here, I'm compelled to say food is average and not up to the price points. Fish terrine appetizer was enjoyable, followed by an over cooked monkfish in a lovely curry based sauce. Dining partners felt Mussels Provençal were good but there could've been more, she had to ask for more bread to soak up the juices. Other diner enjoyed his Sole Meunière. Nice and reasonably priced wine list. We skipped dessert"}
{"text":"I'm always in search of a new truly \"Classic\" French restaurant to try since our favorite one in Scottsdale closed a few years ago... and Voila, we found one. This quaint little restaurant, hidden in a strip mall is a neighborhood gem. I made 7:30 Saturday dinner reservation through Open Table, when we arrived all the tables were filled and our table was waiting for us.  Loved the menu item choices. We started off with the Sliced Duck Foie Gras special, a dozen Escargot, and 6 open mussels with parsley butter and garlic. Entrees ordered: the Classic Steamed Mussels in garlic, shallots and white wine, Dover sole filet \"Meuniere\", and Duck Leg Confit in Orange Sauce. My only comment of improvement would be the size portion of the Duck dish, maybe adding part of a breast in addition. All the food was delicious and perfectly cooked and perfectly presented. Can't wait to return and try the other menu items!  Atmosphere: very nice quaint Bistro feel, Service: excellent, Food: excellent."}
{"text":"Not quite as happy as some of the other reviewers here but I will be back.  Service was a bit slow, took quite a while to get our drink orders.  The bread and dip is fabulous and tempting to fill up on it.  I thought the salmon tartar was fairly dull, it was labeled \"spicy\" but it wasn't.  My shrimp dish was ver flavorfull but the shrimp were overcooked and tough.  My spouse liked his duck dish a lot. Other diners liked the eggplant tart and anchovy pastry a lot as well.  The beet salad was sort of ordinary as were the fries.  All in all though, there were a lot of interesting menu selections and we'll try it again in the near future.  I was sorry to see Dragonfly go but really glad this is here.  I really like to support small restaurants with local owners vs chains.  Update:  Went back yesterday a litle after 7:30 and was told they were out of bread and dip!  How can you run out of bread?  It is like running out of water, sort of..... So we left.  Went to Marco's instead."}
{"text":"Very friendly, good food & enjoyable atmosphere.  A little pricey for this resturaunt."}
{"text":"We have been to Voila 3 times and have enjoyed the food immensely.  On the first visit we had a lovely conversation with the owner but on the next two she barely had time to ask us how we liked our dinner and one of those times we were actually on our way out the door.  One of the reasons we return to a restaurant on an ongoing basis is to get to know the owners and to feel like we're returning to a place that feels somewhat like home.  While we felt it the first time, we were very disappointed the next 2 times and both times we had guests with us.  I realize that the owner is very busy keeping the food flowing between kitchen and dining room but her presence is what makes the place special and I feel she needs to circulate more and make herself more available to the diners.  Also, we had the same waitress the last two times and she doesn't seem very sure of herself, doesn't really engage with the table, and doesn't seem to have much knowledge about the food she is serving.  She didn't seem comfortable serving in a fine French restaurant.  I'm not saying we won't return but hope that our comments listed above will be taken into consideration."}
{"text":"A slice of France in Scottsdale.  We enjoyed a delicious three-course lunch at this intimate restaurant today.  As others have mentioned the co-owner Segolene is delightful, and we were beautifully served by Carly.  The food is amazing for the $17 menu price, which compensates for the very un-French 2.5 times markup (but unfortunately typical for Scottsdale) on the good wine list.  We will definitely return, and can highly recommend it."}
{"text":"If this review looks like a summary of all of the other Yelp reviews, it's because Yelpers have really tagged Voila, at least collectively.  The bottom line is that Voila does a lot of things very well but just when you are going to say you love the restaurant, there is a discordant note or two.  Or three.  I think our experience was typical.  Two of our entrees were delicious -- the lamb chops and the scallops.  Another, the branzino, was badly overcooked and dry.  The desserts were great (floating island) but the asparagus salad was totally unremarkable and without flavor.  The ambiance was comfortable and uncrowded, inside and out, but the server (not the owner) was humorless and seemed disinterested or perhaps just distracted.  The wine list was thoughtful and reasonably priced, but the overall cost of about $70 per person was a shade high.  Perhaps this is meant to imitate a Parisien bistro, but it does not compare with even the average dinners we had in Paris (for less money).    Overall we still enjoyed ourselves, but the value is not there and the food has too many misses."}
{"text":"Has a great lunch here.  The escargots were tender and garlicky. And my quiche Lorraine was the best I've ever had, that is what happens when you use high quality French cheese and then French butter for the crust, which was such a good pastry I would eat it plain!  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"We arrived at Phoenix starving & looking for a deliciously meal within easy driving from our hotel. I saw the reviews for Voila & made a reservation. We were not disappointed!! Our servers (one of the owners brought us bread & water, followed by wines of our choice. She was friendly and helpful. I had the mussels with pomme frites, SO had the fish. Everything was fresh, delicious & simply prepared. Go there!"}
{"text":"I don't think I have enough stars to rate the new owner/ chef Jean Christophe! Last night we celebrated my husband's 50 th birthday!  I had vaguely mentioned his love for foie gras and had asked if they could make something with that in mind!  I have to say I was blown away at how thoughtful and creative the meal was!!! And mind blowing delicious !!  They even made a cake ( I had not even requested one I thought we would put a candle on a slice of something sweet) , a mouthwatering cake!!! And they remembered details of what we like.  I am very thankful! Thank you to Jean Christophe and Segolene!  We always love eating there but last night was very special!!  Updated review for mother's day brunch !  What a wonderful brunch we had on the lovely patio. As usual everything was delicious.  A sumptuous  special menu for the occasion that we shared with our sons.  The egg Benedicts tasted the way they are suppose to taste but never could at other places.  My boys who are picky ate with appetite! Beef bourguignon and apple tart ! Thank you for the rose!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this cute little dinner spot. It is run by the chef and his wife, who is the utmost friendliest hostess. I highly recommend the duck leg config, which had the perfect flavoring and texture. Another magical dish was the foie gras with caramelized apples, so well balanced, I loved it.   For appetizers we ordered the escargot and the poached egg. I highly recommend the latter as it was bursting with flavor. For dessert two of my top picks are Île flottante and the creme brulee.   They also have a great wine selection. Overall, the food is amazing, the service is great and the ambiance is nice and quaint."}
{"text":"The patio is lovely. The server was friendly. The bread and garlic dip were fantastic. Then things went downhill. My mussels were still cool, obviously they had been frozen. The burger meat was mediocre and the dish had to be sent back for grilled onions and cheese. Sadly, we had dropped from 5 stars to 3."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming here for a handful of reasons: (1) French! Yes, if you speak (or in my case pretend to) the language, you'll love this hidden gem. The place is tucked back away in a plaza (like everything else in Arizona), but don't let that fool you. The interior of the bistro transports you to a chic place somewhere else in the world. The owners speak French too and will engage you as well (2) Ambience! Lots of great artwork and little reminders of Paris surround you. The music also contributes greatly to the overall experience. (3) Food! Great authentic food really completes the experience--all at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Wonderful wine list in this quaint little hidden gem. Reasonably priced too. I loved the presentation of each dish. The escargot was soft and buttery and served very hot in the dish. Mussels had a perfect blend of seasoning and plenty of buttery, yum to stop up the homemade bread. Perfect dipping sauce. My Dad enjoyed the trout. We had no room for dessert but plan to return to give it a try."}
{"text":"So far so good!  Will check back on after I eat.  Quaint, adorable, love the ambiance; they've captured a street side French cafe wonderfully!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!!  My wife and I were driving out to find a new place to try, and Voilà, we found this delightful and totally French restaurant.  It's small without being cramped, elegant without been fussy, and the food, well, the food was terrific.  I started with the chef's salad, which was quite substantial, as well as delicious, and my wife had the endive salad.  Also substantial and tasty.    But the best part was the entrees.  All we could think about while my wife savored the Boeuf Bourguignon was Julie and Julia, the movie where Julia Child's Boeuf Bourguignon  conquered all.  We haven't had Julia's Boeuf Bourguignon, but this was surely as good.  And I had the roasted chicken, which came with perfectly cooked string beans and a base of tasty mashed potatoes.  It was served hot, nicely presented, very very French all around.   I can't really say enough about how wonderfully French and special the meal was.  You should go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent entrees, good wine, only one beer, made for a great experience.  Escargot were disappointing (rubbery). We'll be back. Excellent bread."}
{"text":"first time for my wife and I; early weekday dinner, went for the bouillabaisse after reading the recommendation in the local paper.  Great location it seems in an upscale outdoor mall. The young man greeted us casually yet pleasantly. The choice of tables for 2 is rather limited to 5 wooden \"bistro\" tables placed around the small dining room. French music is playing from a satelite station broadcasting a French radion station, nice touch. We picked 2 glasses of rose wine from France, a bit expensive at $12 for 5 ounces pour (we inquired about the size) the wine is poured in classy large stemware. A small French flag adorns the table, which in my opinion should be teamed with the flag from the host country, the US in that case; that's the ethical way of displaying your flag when in another country. The menu is very limited but our bouillabaisse (served for 2) was copious and excellent. Of course, one should not expect the ingredients that make up a bouillabaisse in Marseille, this is Arizona! yet, the well seasoned broth, the crab legs, scallops, mussels, clams, cod and calamari made for an excellent dish, if not \"authentic\". I will complain though, that no \"rouille\" and no garlic rubbed baguette came with, a shortcoming indeed, that need not be! The presentation was \"homey\" from a large tureen into individual plates, served mostly by the pleasant young waiter. My wife had an appetizer of eggplant, cheeses baked on a slab of puff dough, satisfying. My house salad made up of mixed greens (mostly spinach) lacked dressing all together; a ramequin of balsamic vinegar vinaigrette was brought to me, a quick solution, yes! but I wondered how a wait person could bring a dry salad w/o noticing? A big A+ for the country style bread and the spread that comes with it! All in all a pleasant experience food-wise. The flatware could not be of cheeper quality, you know, the type that bends as you pick it up from the table....well, ok, it's a bistro...but at $121- plus gratuity for 2...1 house salad, 1 appetizer, bouillabaisse for 2, no dessert, 3 glasses of  casual wine......it tends to be on the high side. Go and pay them a visit, you be the judge."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:58 PM, two minutes before Happy Hour ended.  Asked the waiter if we could still get HH prices.  He said it was \"up to the computer\" but then went into the back and came out and said he could do it. We ordered HH wine and HH entrees. Bill came and there was no HH discount.  The waiter said look for a fifty% discount on the bill.  There was none. Waiter said there was nothing he could do about it because he could not override the computer. He admitted the computer took HH prices  when we ordered, but had no explanation why the final  bill did not reflect the HH prices. He brought us a complimentary dessert as an apology. So, who runs this place?  People  or a computer?  For us this is a neighborhood eatery and we will definitely NOT return."}
{"text":"My wife and I had one meal here and everything was perfect. We had the sole meunière, scallops with puff pastry, onion soup, and Grand Mariner soufflé. This is an unapologetic old-school French restaurant that could have been around in its exact form in the 1970s (and I suspect the 50s but am not eyewitness to that decade.)  The classics don't need updating.  Update: ate here a second time. It was just as good. Had the Niçoise salad and different desserts. All outstanding."}
{"text":"We heard about this quaint little restaurant on the news early in the morning. I've always wanted to find a great French restaurant in Arizona. Well today was the day that we visited and had lunch. What I can tell you first off is that the restaurant is very clean and makes you feel welcome. The owners are gracious and friendly. Once we ordered we kicked back and relaxed on the beautiful patio. The food was incredible. You can definitely tell the quality with every single bite. Every so often they have great three-course specials, and I highly recommend taking advantage of that. I can't wait to come back and taste more delicious food. I highly recommend this place to eat if you are in the mood for an amazing French meal."}
{"text":"Little Paris in Arizona! I was on my way to a breakfast place initially, but ended up in this modern and well embellished French bistro. Lunch menu is amazing, partially written in the native language. The service is great. I even dusted my French with (I suppose) the owner who's originally from France. One of the very few places that has Croque Madame!  C'est magnifique madame merci beaucoup et à bientôt!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably great food!  The Canard a l'Orange (Orange Duck) and the Tarte Tartain were the best I've ever had.  The Filet au Poivre likewise was superb, as were the Scallops au Gratin (Coquille St. Jacques).  A magnificent culinary experience!  Mild quibbles:  they need to train their staff a little better, and they need a bigger wine list.  Overall, however .. . . . this is a great place!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonight for the first time since new owners took over (about Sept 2015)  Couldn't be more pleased. Quaint atmosphere,  owner is involved and adorable. Her husband is the chef.  The food was fantastic and I am French and come from a family of restaurateurs. I am definitely highly recommending this little Bistro and will be returning often. Really truly enjoyed everything. Made me feel back at home but in beautiful Arizona. Casual and warm. A small piece of heaven. Wishing you the best Voila Bistro!"}
{"text":"Great new chef as of October 1st, 2015, no comparison to George! The food now tastes like a 1st class french restaurant not like before. The new Chef comes from a line of famous french michelin rated restaurants apparently, and you can taste the difference!!! This must have been the best french meal I have ever had and I lived in europe for 16 years. Highly recommend it! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Dinner was spectacular last week .  I was flying solo and decided to indulge. Started with hot foie gras and apples....just melted in my mouth...moved on to the mussels....perfect...next was one of the best duck confit I had in the valley and finally ended the evening with a light dessert made of egg whites and sweet cream.  Service was excellent..very attentive. Top notch quality French food ..and so close to home...only negative was the weight I gained and weight my wallet lost....but you get what you pay for in life and it was well worth it."}
{"text":"My French family LOVES this place! We come here often and It just gets better with every meal we order. Tonight we not only celebrated Valentine's Day but it was my parents 59th wedding anniversary! The food for this well prepared fixed menu was seriously AMAZING!"}
