{"text":"Me and my family haVe been eating steak and cheese for over 5years But I've never had steak and cheese like this before! Hot and fresh straight from mama's grill ,and you know mama knows best!  I recommend to all."}
{"text":"I tried the Philly Cheese steak at Cheese Factory located at Yonge and Eglinton. This was because I wanted to see myself if it really the best as people were stating. So I went there and this is what I found out.   The taste was good. The lady prepared it within 5 min. It was mixture of Onions, Green peppers, Pickles, Hot sauce and mayo.   I was hoping she was gonna ask if I wanted to add anything more to it but well she didnt and thrust the sandwich into my hands.   I thought it would be juicer, a bit greasy but instead it was dry, non greasy, but overall taste was good.   I would not be a regular over  there but wouldnt mind goin there once in blue moon."}
{"text":"Awful.  Just ordered tonight and it was absolutely terrible.  Philadelphia called, and they're pissed.  Arrived warm, so no complaints there.  But the ingredients were low-quality.  Dry meat and veggies, apparently cheese (though you can't taste it) served on a hot dog bun.  The \"spicy fries\" are bowling-alley quality.  Limp, flavourless, and mushy.  This is a poor imitation of Subway's \"Southwest steak and cheese\"."}
