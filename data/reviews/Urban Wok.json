{"text":"I should have checked the reviews first! Truly disgusting \"Chinese\" food. Hard, yet gummy tofu with a strange burnt-like taste. Sweet and sour chicken with a gross taste. Even the fried rice tasted old and gross.  They also don't have smaller portions, only the two-entree mess.  Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"Basically what the other people have said is true. The absolute worst \"Asian\" food I have ever eaten. I got the General Tso's chicken and it wasn't like any chicken I have ever eaten before. It had the oddest texture, I can't really place it, almost like it was freezer burnt or something. The fried rice was terrible also, it was slimy. My wife and I ate here while we were at Phoenix Comic Con and it was $30 for two entr√©es and two drinks. The drink station was filthy. There was a dirty rag and cleaning solution right next to it, hello major health code violation. I would starve to death before I ever eat here again. Fortune cookie was good though. ^.^"}
{"text":"I also should have read the reviews before eating here. Not that I had fantastically high expectations for convention center food, but this falls way below even bare minimum standards.  This was so bad it made me sign up for Yelp just to review it. I even hear the employees describing the food as \"awful\" after a customer left. Nasty, slimy, tasteless chicken. Tiny scoop of fried rice. Tastes like freezer burn everywhere. I know convention center food places will have higher prices but $5 for a soda??  \"Foul\" is the best description. Avoid at all costs.  Staff was also rude and snippy. The first employee had no idea about the menu options (hint: there's only one $10 abomination) and the second seemed to delight in saying \"no, we don't offer cups for water\" and \"no, we don't offer bags\" and \"$5 for a soda..yeah I don't blame you, I wouldn't pay that much either.\"  Horrible."}
{"text":"Never come here... It's a waste of money. Food is inedible, not cooked on site and just sits in a reheater all day. Egg roll is greasy as hell. Chicken was chewy and gritty and tasted nothing like orange chicken. The dish was served in a sloppy container that the server had covered in sauce when filling it."}
{"text":"I was at a competition for two days at the Phoenix convention center 3/4 and 3/5 and I got two egg rolls. They weren't that great but whatever.. Panda Express has wayyyyy better egg rolls. And the egg rolls at Urban Wok are $3 a piece! Insane! And the egg rolls are very dry but they drip a ton of grease(?) and they aren't special at all and I was very disappointed.. Also, the lady charged me twice, and I didn't realize it until it was two late, and of course they don't have a phone number to call and talk to someone about it. I live way too far to just casually go back, and I am very very angry. Will NEVER go here again. If they hadn't double charged me, maybe I would go back but no way. (They knew exactly what they were doing too) THIS PLACE IS A SCAM BE CAREFUL!"}
{"text":"A Chinese fast food copy of Panda Express in the Phoenix Convention Center, but worse.  I don't think they cook their food on the premises since I overheard one employee talking about getting more cooked food at the warehouse.  Might explain why their food was half cooked .  Better to order out of the convention center."}
