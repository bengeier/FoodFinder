{"text":"This is my go to pizza! Free delivery (in my area) the pizza is great, the wings are huge! Tons of flavor! If I get pizza for the family, this is who we get.  We usually do 2 med pizzas, delivered it is just under $20. Staff is always friendly. Super happy with this place!"}
{"text":"The customer Service was amazing and there pizza was unique, who ever made there pizza is gifted it had a perfect amount of every topping totally making this my regular pizzeria"}
{"text":"Worst takeout I've had in a really long time. Wings were basically like rubber and in eatable. Got a Caesar salad too and it came with two little packs of dressing the size of the jelly packs you find on the counter at the dinner. It was literally enough dressing to use on 20% of the salad.   This was my second try at this place after a friend recommended it. The first time I got the lasagna and a Caesar. The lasagna tasted like spaghettios. And that salad showed up with no dressing at all. The garlic bread was good but that was small shimmer in a otherwise worthless experience. Unfortunately it wasn't so worthless for them. Tonight's venture was over 30 bucks."}
{"text":"the pizza and price was really good. love the combos you can get. only thing is we got a combo with extra sauces and they gave us like 6 cokes instead and we didn't order any drinks and i hate coke and we just wanted the sauces it said it included in the combo. still, the pizza was amazing and an amazing price and came on time (an hour delivery give or take). overall good experience compared to my other experiences with pizza places."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years now. I remember they used to sell a large pep and a 2 litre coke for like $4.99. It was such a good deal.  The pizza is really good, including the slices. Next time I'm in the area, I might stop in for a slice."}
{"text":"Great pizza flat out. The service is excellent and polite. I've been eating here for over 20 years and they are consistently excellent. Great value for the money."}
{"text":"Last year this was the best pizza in the neighborhood for the price. Now, with the new price increase, it's still better than the local name brands of shops. Now they can make a XL pizza in eight minutes. They just forgot you're  waiting outside for an additional 10 minuets."}
{"text":"Will not call again.   The on-duty manager argued with us for over 25 minutes after they forgot to include 4 soft drink cans on our first order (INCLUDED in the deal) & would NOT include them in the identical order the next day... He LIED, claiming that they do NOT keep records of orders from the previous day & could not verify that we did NOT receive our drinks. However, at the same time, he was afraid that the owner would visit the FOLLOWING day and see the RECORDS, indicating that our SECOND order had 8 drinks (to make up for the FOUR that we didn't receive the FIRST time).   We just asked for what was fair & he hung up on us. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza I had ordered a sandwich which took 15 to 20 min to make another time got a Hawaiian pizza slice it was thick and raw never again will I buy from them although the wings they have are ok but that's about it."}
