{"text":"Amazing fresh food.   Different from the norm.   The food is very tasty and we'll seasoned,  a great place to share and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal here and were wonderfully served.  Tortillas and tacos all perfectly prepared and presented, and mouth-wateringly delicious.  Truly a culinary tour de force and gastronomic wonder.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I love the El Pocho fries, Street corn and Chorizo with cactus. But the stake tacos are my favorite!!!! Also the Margareta is the best  I've had. Just tried brunch and it was sooo good. Great coffee and lovely staff."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, friendly staff, reasonable prices. I went for lunch- shared the salad, veggie tacos, and chicken tacos with a friend. Everything was excellent. Probably the best tacos I've had in Toronto (maybe even better than Seven Lives!). Nice patio. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, good drinks and a chill vibe. It's not huge but that adds you the ambiance. Loads of first daters abound, makes for a lot of hushed conversations.. Interesting!   Completely GF which is a bonus if you need that.  Last word, Churros!"}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian tacos, the corn dish and he guac,salsa and chips.. Was delicious. Nice mixture of flavours and all seemed fresh. Margarita was a nice addition. Will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"I try not to throw 5 stars around willy nilly, but this little nook is the real deal. Had brunch here about 5 times with my partner and I've never left disappointed. Portions are large (I'd hope so for $12+) and they don't skimp on the protein. I've had all the breakfast entrees, but Potato and Chorizo might be my fave. I frequently leave with leftovers. Salsa/Guac/Chips (actually $8, not $6 on the website) surpass Los Guacamoles, and some other local rivals.  I just hope it sticks around... sometimes it's a ghost town on a Sunday morning. Atmosphere is chill and dark inside, no problems with the service on any visit. I've also eaten at Grapefruit Moon about a dozen times, but this place takes the crown. Don't sleep."}
{"text":"This was a random find for brunch last weekend. I ordered the chicken tostada, which was filling and very delicious - it hit the spot perfectly. It was a Sunday morning, so the place filled up pretty steadily after we were seated. Still, the service was prompt and attentive. That all said, I'm excited to have a new Mexican place nearby (they've only been open 5 months) that doesn't have the chaos of other eateries in Toronto. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED!!!!!!!!!! Tasted ok but $13 for fries - give me a break.  So aggravating.  Total rip off.  AVOID."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem. Great service and atmosphere. The tortilla chips were hot and served with fresh salsa and guac. We got the pulled chicken taco and deep fried avocado taco. The deep fried avocado taco was so damn good. The mango salsa with the jalape√±o kick was perfection. Everything I tasted had a homemade/made with love vibe. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem, one of my top favourites now for tacos, and I thought was better than some of the other popular Toronto spots like the Playa Cabana chain or Grand Electric. ALSO, for people with gluten sensitivities, the taco menu is gluten-free because they use corn tortillas.  Went here on a Saturday night for dinner for 2. I read the previous reviews about the size of the space, which is really small inside so definitely make reservations.   The food was great, we had various tacos and beer, including the barbacoa beef (highly recommend), fish, vegetarian tostada, and (daily special) chicken tostada. They definitely fill up the tacos with fillings and toppings, I was happy with the portion sizes, especially because I like healthy and fresh foods so there was a balanced meat to fresh veggie topping ratio.   It was great value for the price. It is the standard taco price in downtown Toronto (working out to $4.5+ per taco/tostada), and we had 4 tacos/tostadas each, which was enough to satisfy our appetites.   The service was amazing! We were 15 minutes late for our reservation but I had called to let them know we were stuff in traffic and they were kind enough to still hold our table. Our server was really friendly and attentive. The service was fast. It was a pleasant experience. Would definitely come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"I love the concept - it really is a snack bar. There's no entrees or main courses, but instead a lot of appetizer or snack dishes like nachos or tacos.  The food was good, but it didn't blow me away. I'd definitely recommend the nachos as the chips were amazing. We tried the chicken tacos and deep fried avocado tacos which again, were good but we wouldn't come back for. Drinks were really good, I got the Caesar's Caesar and a couple shots from their $3 daily rail bar.  Space was pretty small, but once we were seated we didn't notice it. I think it'll make a big difference in summer when they can open the patio so we can spread out.  Would definitely recommend the place, it looks like a lot of people love it. We dropped in for a few quick drinks before catching a show at Tarragon Theatre which is just around the corner"}
{"text":"I honestly enjoyed my meal, but once I saw the bill I forgot all about the food. Way overpriced for what you get. I went with a Mexican friend who laughed that Canadians would pay this much for average tacos and elotes which are essentially just snacks. There's better taco options out there! Can't see myself returning."}
{"text":"El Pocho is an amazing addition to the Northernly part of the Annex / Bathurst neighborhood. In the last couple of years we've had a few bars & restaurants pop up in this neck of the woods, which is welcome as one does not always want to go do to Bloor Street for a pint or to get something to eat.  I checked this place out with my roomates yesterday.  We came around 9 pm for a drink & a snack.  The had a tall can $5 special of Techate Beer which we order & an order of the Tortillas Y Salsas for $6.  DELICIOUS!  I've been to a few Mexican places & am always disappointed by the grocery bag Tortillas that are served - NOT HERE.  They seemed home-made on the spot to me .. warm, crunchy & delicious.  I would definitely come here for brunch.  The best part of this bar thought is the service.  Our server was lovely, efficient, friendly & knew her tequila.  When we arrived there were 2 other groups on the patio & our server noticed us right away & our beer order came quickly.  None of that sitting around for 15 minutes or \"tell us you are on the patio\" BS like some places.   El Pocho is not open late on weekdays but we were told very politely that we had 15 minutes before the patio closed.  I appreciate that & will be back!    In closing, El Pocho was a great place for a chill, relaxing evening of food & drinks."}
{"text":"This place serves Fantastic food, and (except for the beer) its all Celiac friendly GF, which is very easy to do but rare in Toronto. Service and atmosphere to match, can't wait until summer when the patio is open again. Five Stars!!"}
{"text":"We just went here for the first time.  Love it.  Great margarita, sizable patio and solid tacos.  Small but good menu.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"My boss recommended this place to me, saying it was the best Mexican food she had ever had, and that it was very cheap.  My boyfriend and I checked it out a few days ago, and I have to agree that it is very good Mexican food, at a very fair price!  I tried the vegetarian tacos, which had corn, pickled cactus, green sauce, and black beans.  It was very good, but was missing the avocado.  I also tried the guac and chips, and they had freshly made the chips, so they were still warm.  So yummy.  Also tried the corn, which had a spicy mayo-type sauce, cheese, and cilantro.  Also yummy!  Prices were good.  3 tacos for $10.  Will definitely be going back!  They also had a nice patio.  Didn't try the cocktails."}
{"text":"First time in Canada ( I might be the only Mexican in Canada) I come from Southern California and a I know what Authentic Mexican food is. Thought I'd check this place out to see what it was about. Did not disappoint! I tried a little of everything coming from a 6hour flight from LAX I was starving. The place is well maintained and the staff is very friendly. I got to meet the owner and his wife great people and the owner himself is Mexican (Michoacano)/ Canadian so he knows about Mexican food. I'm a taco guy so I'm def giving these guys a 5 star for the hospitality, ambiance, and the great food! Will def come back on my next venture here to beautiful Canada!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and was impressed by their interior design; cozy. They seem to have a lovely patio outside with hanging lights. It could be a cool place to hangout out on a warm summer evening.  They keep a small menu, which is what I like. I never understanding the idea of doing a lot of things mediocre instead of doing a few things really well. I had the chicken toscada and shared some fries with some aoili sauce. The fries were too salty and the sauce was plain. The chicken toscada was good but I did have a hard time finding anything unique or special. For example, I really can't tell you what I like or don't like about the dish even though I just had it. Finally, I think they might want to think about carrying a couple spicy hot sauces. By spicy I mean, spicy enough to hurt you...maybe twice. Mexican food needs to be spicy.   Overall, I understand the concept (small menu) and I like atmosphere. Hopefully the food will become more uniquely flavorful, especially if they want to separate itself from the thousands of restaurants in Toronto. Good potential."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We were visiting a friend over the weekend that had nothing but wonderful things to say about this place, and now we know why. Their food (specifically their tacos) were amazing. I'd like to give a shout out to Kevin D. for always being the first to recommend to share food/split meal options so that we have the opportunity of trying more on the menu. I personally had their fish and chicken tacos and loved them both. But my favorite was most definitely the fish. Soooo good. They also offered steak, pork and fried avocado tacos. Their cocktail list was super extensive and everything looked worthy of trying. We stuck with the mojito and tequila old fashioned.   As for the restaurant itself, it really didn't seat a ton of people and we lucked out getting a seat outside because it was such a beautiful night out. It appears to still be a hidden gem in Toronto - and I'd definitely enjoying going back!"}
{"text":"Happy to have this cute spot in the neighbourhood. It's a bit off the beaten track (on Follis) but once you find it you'll see that there's a lovely patio and inside waiting for you and some yummy food items like fried avocados and elotes (Mexican street corn) to have with your drinks. I look forward to checking them out for a quick brunch. I would choose this place over Grapefruit moon any day."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and order the fish tacos. Tacos here come two to an order and it all gets served as soon as it's ready, in no particular order. Save room for the churros at the end. This place is small and seats about 18 people inside, plus maybe another 20 on the outdoor patio. Call ahead and make a reservation, as it fills up fast on Saturday nights. An added bonus, while they don't heavily advertise it, everything on the menu is totally gluten-free. Win!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Brooklyn and this place reminded me of a few places I frequent in NYC. Creative Mexican inspired food and cocktails, with very friendly service. I went for brunch and had the chorizo and eggs, and the dirty Paloma. Both were perfect! Definitely check it out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Also used to come here when it was Scoop and Bean, and it's a great reinvention by the owner, Cesar. We had a nice afternoon snack of chips and housemade guacamole, and corn with chipotle sauce. We will definitely become regulars  of this quaint neighbourhood spot!"}
{"text":"Talk about an unexpected and delightful discovery! We were headed to an Indian fast-food place nearby when we realized it was closed, so we just looked around and, luckily for our taste buds, spotted El Pocho Antojitos tucked away in a side street.   The atmosphere was delightful - warm, cozy, with beautiful contemporary Mexican feel. The waitress was very welcoming and understanding of our dietary preferences - vegetarian and no eggs. We got three dishes - tostadas, tacos and a salad - and each one was so delicious. My personal favorite were the tostadas. Often Mexican dishes all taste the same despite of the shape and here this wasn't the case at all. Each item had its distinctive flavor and feel, and we loved them all.  We chatted with the lovely waitress after our meal and learned that the owner is from California - that explained it all! Thanks so much for bringing good Mexican food to Toronto. It's a rarity ;-).  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything in this place in perfect! starting from the location and moving to the service and food! we ordered tortillas and gucamole and tapas with meat...amazing!! we will come back soon!"}
{"text":"The server was very nice and the coffee was good. The problem is the egg scramble on the tortillas was extremely greasy and gross. It was really inedible. So oily I started feeling nauseous and my boyfriend wouldn't even try it... at least don't get that dish."}
{"text":"Cute little patio! Came here on a saturday night around 8pm and had to wait about 20 minutes for a patio spot, but they tables available inside.   Cilantro haters beware this place puts a TON of it on, like small mountains or ask for no cilantro!  Got the pocho fries and the topping of the day was pork for $8. Fries felt fresh and came out hot, the pork was flavorful and not dry or chewy. came with a bit of a mayo drizzle, onions and lots of cilantro.   The beef tacos were good, beef was again juicy and the spicy salsa was delicious. The fried avocado one was also great, loved the mango sauce. The avocado had a crispy shell that stayed crispy and didnt get soggy! Overall the food was great, however 2 tacos, fries and a drink later both still pretty hungry and the bill came up to be around $35-$40 for 2 people. It was good but i didnt leave as satisfied as I do with other taco places"}
{"text":"The prices are very reasonable. The homemade chips and guacamole is best. They fried the chips for us. The salad and tacos also great. The corn might be better in corn season."}
{"text":"This small tucked away resto-bar is a hidden gem and a must try if you love Mexican food. While you may be hard pressed to find legit Mexican food, El Pocho Antojitos offers food that is as close as you can get.  I stopped by for brunch on the weekend. I was impressed by the cute ambiance, friendly staff and great selection of dishes. We ended up ordering the Chilaquilles and Huevos Rancheros, with cappuccinos to drink. The portions are quite large, served with lots of beans and side of delicious freshly made salsa. The dishes were topped with fresh herbs and tasted great, reminded me of some of the food I had while in Mexico. The waitress recommended ordering the churros afterwards and was not disappointed, really delicious with homemade de leche dip.   During the rest of the day, they offer a selection of tacos, cant wait to come back to try.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"A lovely cozy place! Pretty patio on the outside and cozy seats within. The atmosphere was really comforting.   The food was great as well. I had chicken soft tacos, there were a bit smaller than what I'm used to, but tasted great with pickled cabbage. The flavours were really compatible. However it was a bit too salty for my preference, but my friends loved it. So I guess salt is more of a personal thing. Other than that, the tacos were yummy and I might come back again."}
{"text":"I picked this place to try with some friends because of the reviews and ratings.   Food: The food was nothing special. There are definitely better Mexican restaurants in the city. The tacos come with 2 per plate but are very small. This place relies heavily on cilantro. On the menu, it even says if you don't like cilantro, make sure to tell them before hand. I watched the 1 chef in the back making tacos...she literally grabbed a handful of chopped cilantro and just plopped it on top of the tacos. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE cilantro but I like it when I adds something to the dish, but they put so much on, it practically makes up half the taco toppings.  We got the: chorizo y nopales: the filling was very dry, tacos de carne: steak was burnt tacos gringos: not bad but I think it's because it had sour cream on it making it not so dry tacos de pescado: probably the best one of the night, the fish was deep fried and melted in our mouths beef barbacoa pocho fries: also a good choice and the beef here wasn't burnt (thank goodness).  What saved the meal in my opinion were the churros  and dulce de leche sauce which were delicious! If you ever choose to come here, just get the churros and maybe the fish tacos.  Service: Mediocre at best. This place only has a handful of tables and the night we came, there were only 2 or 3 other tables with people. Our server was not inviting and didn't seem happy at all to serve us. We had to ask for more water after waiting and after eating all our food. Not a very observant server.  Ambiance: The lack of effort with water was probably due to how dark the restaurant was. They have Edison bulbs strung throughout which provide absolutely no light so you the place is so dark. If you're hoping to see the people your dining with, I wouldn't recommend this place.  Overall, go somewhere else. You can get better food for the same price somewhere else and you can definitely get better Mexican food somewhere else."}
{"text":"We just had brunch at El Pocho and it was a wonderful dining experience. As patrons of Scoop and Bean (the cafe that was there prior to the El Pocho transformation), I am pleased to say the coffee is still as excellent as it has always been. We sat on the patio and immediately were brought water and menus. Our server was attentive and had a great personality. There was a very large group who had arrived prior to us so there was a bit of a wait for our food but we were brought complimentary freshly house-made tortilla chips sprinkled with cinnamon that were absolutely delicious. We shared the potato hash and chorizo main and it was incredibly delicious, hot and flavourable. The south facing patio was warm and lovely even on a cooler morning. Highly recommend El Pocho!! Thanks Cesar!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, fabulous fresh food, outstanding service and all gluten-free! My celiac husband is so very happy! New menu coming soon... thanks so much El Pocho Antojitos Bar! Great music too!"}
{"text":"Classy spot. Had the chicken tostada off the brunch menu. Clever balance of diverse flavour & texture. Unreal. Excellent service. Great spot."}
{"text":"its a cool little spot, nice ambiance inside and a cute patio but kinda stuffed (not alot of room). Tacos are good, not incredible,  not mediocre. I did enjoy the fried avocado taco it was quite delish. super hipster service, servers fairly un-enthusiastic about doing very much by the end of the night (we came at 9:50, kitchen closes at 10 and resto closes at 11). Overall, I wouldn't return unless i was nearby in a pinch or walking here at night time and hungry for a quick taco and a beer. i do not think this place warrants a 4.5, MAYBE a 3.5 but thats pushing it."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner.  I'll list the food that I had and write a review for each of them.  Tortillas Y Salsas One of the best tortilla chips I had. It was fresh, and the guacamole went well with it. The only issue I had was that some of the chips were not crispy because the oil wasn't cut enough  Elotes The jalapeno aioli went pretty well with the corn. I liked it.  Chorizo y Nopales The chorizo was nice, but the tortillas was mediocre and there was too much pickled cactus compared to the chorizo.  Beef Barbacoa Pocho Fries The beef was amazing but the fries to beef ratio was really high.  Tacos de Pollo Escabeche I don't really like chicken tacos but these were amazing! So tender and juicy.  Tacos de Aguacate Fried avocado tacos. It tastes exactly how you would imagine it to be. They put in a good chunk of avocado, but I feel like they can season the avocado or the batter to make it more flavorful.  Tacos de Pescado This and the chicken tacos were my favorites.  Churros Their churros weren't the typical hard(ish) ones. They were soft and it felt like beignets! I really enjoyed it.  Service was nice and attentive but REALLY slow. Like really slow.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"Super delicious and excellent customer service! Our server was very attentive and checked in on us after every serving. We were trying to find a restaurant to eat after casa loma and felt like tacos. We had the fish tacos (as recommended by a few yelpers) and the poncho fries. The poncho fries were good but I felt like the fish tacos were the star! We ordered the churros for dessert which was an excellent finish to our meal."}
{"text":"Food *** Service **** Ambience ***  (brunch review and rating, based on the other reviews here I am going to come back for dinner!)  Stumbled across this restaurant when a neighbouring restaurant didn't have space for us.  Food and tastes were great however all of our meals were a little bit too oily, leaving it sitting a bit heavy in our stomach.  Our server was attentive and on the ball."}
