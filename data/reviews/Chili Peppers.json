{"text":"Delicious burritos et cetera made with fresh ingredients delivered with a high meat-and-veggies to rice ratio. Plus, for fifty extra cents your burrito can be grilled on the grill, a much tastier thing than I imagined in would be!

While Chipoltle may be named after a single chile pepper, this place is named after all of them.

Iced tea review: 5/5 stars. Real iced tea, with a hint of lime. The fellow behind the counter even came to my table and offered me a refill. I couldn't ask for a better iced tea experience - especially given the scarcity of iced tea at non-national-chain Mexican restaurants. (They still have the usual complement of bottled Jaritos.)"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot for casual dining with counter service and plenty of seating now that they have expanded the dining room. Friendly, fast service with a cooler stocked with Mexican sodas, as well as your other typical beverage selections."}
{"text":"Love Chili Peppers, I go at least once a week!
The build your own burritos are great but the local 
neighborhood feel and the staff there is what bring
me back over and over again!"}
{"text":"Chili Peppers has been here about 13 years or so and it MOST definitely the best Mexican restaurant in the area. I've been going here ever since I discovered them several years ago after moving here from Tucson, AZ. Highly recommend CP!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great burritos for cheap. Not a lot of esoteric ingredients, you'll recognize everything on the bar immediately. They do have a few things that the big chains don't: grilled onions, chorizo, fresh lime, and sliced olives.

The staff has been consistently friendly and pleasant, even when there is a line all the way around the room. (Usually Friday dinner.)

Another nice thing is the selection of Mexican sodas."}
{"text":"I thought I'd write a review just to share that it's like the old Que Tal on Coventery, but I see that's been pretty well covered. Who knew its the same owners! 

Anyway, this place just rocks. I find myself tipping the staff after every meal, even though there's no table service. They just do an excellent job."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic burrito (not the americanized heart attack that is a chipotle burrito) there is no better place in Cleveland than Chili Peppers. Simple as that.

Everything's fresh, prices are good, portions are great. Workers are always friendly. There's nothing not to love about this place.

Doesn't matter where you're at, make the trip (unless you're downtown then just hit their stand in the old arcade), it's worth it."}
{"text":"The best mexican I have had in Cleveland hands down. The only down side was that I wasn't able to wash my delicious tacos made from fresh ingredients down with a margarita. Luckily they had Jarritos, the tasty mexican sodas, to make up for it.

Great place for a cheap date :)"}
{"text":"I totally love this place I can't believe I've lived in this neighborhood this long and never knew this place was here the workers are super cool and the food is great ill never go to any other mexican place again"}
{"text":"I have been going to Chili Peppers for at least 15 years now. LOVE IT!!! I cringe at the thought of Chipotle...... So many more toppings to chose from AND they don't charge extra for guacamole on your food!! I am in love."}
{"text":"Delicious burritos and a ton of options -- without the upcharge for guacamole or the like. Also, the service was great. This place is like a well-oiled machine.

I was impressed at the crowd at lunchtime. I feel that Chili Peppers has a distinct neighborhood vibe, and I'm digging it."}
{"text":"Really good local, fresh food restaurant. This is like  a Chipotle or Qdoba. I think that the prices are very reasonable. The food is fresh and delicious. Employees are patient and friendly. Great place to stop for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I want to start off with a disclaimer to this review: Everything stated in this review is out of pure love an appreciation for a small business. Thoughts of the restaurant are my own and none will be negative. With that being said let's get started. 

I was out with my wife and son last night. We were dropping off my older son with his grandma because she offered to take him for the night so they could spend time together (that's simultaneously relevant and irrelevant), I left my wife in the car for 5 minutes, we already had dinner plans but she ended up opening yelp and seeing that Chili Peppers averaged 4 stars for their ratings. We were already out Euclid so we went ahead and drove down to try them out.

We walked in and we said to ourselves \"Ahhh maybe we should leave, it smells too good here\", we knew we made a mistake by stopping. The interior is, it's an interior. They have a split dining area and at the time we went there the other half wasn't the tidiest. Now I cannot knock them on that and it is sometime good to see a messy interior. I say this because after we ordered our food. It got pretty busy so I understood why. The place is definitely popular. It's a build your own burrito style spot. You know a-la Chipotle, Qdoba. Etc. They have more options though being a smaller business. (side note: I hold small businesses under a different light than I do franchises, this place has stains all on their vent hoods, which made me happier than a tornado in a trailer park)
 
Oops, I think I'm rambling, on to the food. I ordered a grilled burrito, with chorizo, jalapenos, black beans, rice and banana peppers. My wife ordered their nachos with beef, and we ordered our son a soft taco. If I wrote this review solely based on my son trying to feed himself. I think I'd give them 7 stars. My son isn't a picky eater, but particularly he proves when something is especially good by yelling at everyone trying to say he needs more food. But this isn't his review, it's mine. The serving size is excellent for the price. My burrito was packed and it being grilled gave it a nice touch. The chorizo was flavorful, juicy, and the beans were excellent. My wife had nachos that just seemed to never end. I was kind of jealous that I got a burrito instead of nachos with chorizo. In any case I know what I'm getting next time. (There will definitely be a next time) I forgot to mention, the staff is friendly and they definitely make sure you understand what's going on. The atmosphere is cool. Relaxed y'know it has an inner city vibe which is a great change of pace from stuffy franchises. 

To close it up. If you're near Euclid, and you want to try something not necessarily different, but a little more homemade? Try chili peppers."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like it used to be an old butcher shop - the aesthetics are run down and not entirely cohesive between the two halves. While we were there a soccer team was having a series of arguments with their coaches. The staff was being trained which caused some confusion and it took several minutes for us to check out. Pricing while cheap is not clear; they use concession stand style labeling instead of shelling out for a real menu board and it was not intuitive to figure out. They serve their food on trays that don't match their plates and make it feel less upscale than the quality of their food. My friend loved his vegetarian burrito (not every place has caramelized onions); my enchiladas were served with tasteless refried beans that had been sitting out too long and overcooked bland rice. Also, who doesn't put cheese inside enchiladas? The topping selections were random and not clearly labeled on the glass above them - this was especially confusing with the various salsas.

Suggestions that would help improve the experience:
Redo the floors 
Get a menu board and menus
Stop using trays 
Get plastic silverware that's black instead of white to make it more upscale; nix the styrofoam to go containers for something less 1990's and more environmentally friendly 
Don't offer enchiladas unless they're cooked in an oven 
Get non-shredded iceberg lettuce and swap out for something like romaine - the iceberg makes you feel like a low quality version of chipotle
List your meat options more clearly on the board 
Put clear labels of what is below in the containers as you go through toppings 
Don't put new employees at the front of the ordering line on a busy day 
Don't yell at new employees when they can't figure things out 
Push upsell of things like guacamole and chips and drinks more clearly
Create a clearer assembly line system for who does the tortillas, who does beans meats and rice, and who does toppings. Having one person go all the way down the line is inefficient and separates people who are shopping together 
Get a design consultant to overhaul the interior to make the feel more intentional and fresh instead of like the cafeteria line at a summer camp"}
{"text":"I was looking for something in the neighborhood I was passing through for a quick bite. It was a pleasant surprise!

I did not expect much judging from the exterior and also interior but the food was decent. The waitress was very nice, she helped me introduce to their menu and helped pick my dish. It is nice for vegetarians because I could see all the ingredients. It is just like Chipotle and Qudoba, I will give it more stars than Qudoba but less than Chipotle. Food tastes good and fresh. It is a local restaurant and not a chain. 

I will visit here again if I am in this neighborhood or passing by during lunch or dinner time."}
{"text":"Not bad. It's Chipotle in Euclid basically. The cheese sauce and guac were both gross (cheese sauce had a gone wrong burnt taste to it and the avacados were not ripe) but the rest was A OK. Will go again even though it is a couple bucks pricier than need be."}
{"text":"Ok, didn't end up eating here.  Walked in and the place had an odd odor and the food did not look good at all.  No one was in the restaurant during rush hour, which seemed suspicious.  Sorry,  just wasn't willing to give this place a try, despite the reviews."}
{"text":"Love this little place! I moved to California and I crave their food all the time! Everything is customizable, and made to your liking. Love the build your own burrito, never disappoints. The quesadillas are amazing - they are grilled on a flat top and always melty and delicious! The owner is always in and really cares about his customers getting the best experience!"}
{"text":"Chipotle-style where you pick your dish (burrito, tacos, nachos, etc.) and then decide which  meat and toppings you want added. I had nachos with chicken, refried beans, and cheese. Two toppings come standard, others are a little extra. All the toppings I tried, a total of 5, were super fresh and full of flavor! Hot sauce at the table has a nice kick too. Will definitely be back to try the other options. If this were closer, I might be saying goodbye to my good friend Chipotle."}
{"text":"First time with a friend. Was a nice little place for a fresh and light summer dinner. Had the bowl and side of chips. Got to choose all my toppings. Along with a pop and my bill was $10 and change. Would go again. PS... you don't get a lot of meat."}
{"text":"All food fresh, but its a bit too expensive to not have any flavor. I'll stick to Chipotle"}
{"text":"BEST Mexican Food Around!!!
Today my son and I got the chicken quesadillas and they were delicious 
The employees here are extremely nice, friendly, and always so pleasant."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great tacos and burritos. Don't forget to try the soup either. The employees are great, and Steve the owner is there everyday and a great guy."}
{"text":"Out-of-towners on the road looking for a quick bite.  AWESOME grub!  Ladies were quick and friendly.  Great local atmosphere and fun music."}
{"text":"I'm seriously wondering why it's taken me so long to write a review to this place.  I'm a sucker for this food type and I've had the good, bad & the ugly.  Lucky for us, this is the good.  The oh-so-coming-back-fo'-mo and mo' GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Very good food with reasonable prices. It's a chill place to eat and carryout is quick and professional. Gotta visit here at least 1-2 times every few months. Fresh veggies and food served warm/hot. Staff gets you in & out (that's good enough customer service for me)."}
{"text":"I want to support local businesses like this especially with Chipotle opening up. I went there twice in 2 weeks & both times the meat was cold."}
{"text":"I keep seeing people saying this place is like Que Tal was. Guess what? It's BETTER than Que Tal seeing as I have never had (or known anyone who had) food poisoning from Chili Peppers! Prices are fair, interesting people watching in the dining room. The burrito is excellent for a case of the munchies. Dude has been in the neighbourhood forever and that counts for something with me."}
{"text":"Chili Peppers is on fire! Stopped in after a trip out to Euclid and I was craving some good mexican food. I was sick of chipotle so i was like lets give it a whirl.

Upon entering i was a little confused because its really a hole in the wall. The decor is all over the place, grease stains on the wall, teenagers running the counter. But to my pleasant surprise the food was really really good.

I had the beef nachos which were packed high and loaded with toppings. I definetly got my moneys worth with this batch. Paired it with a nice lime jarritos and i was good to go.

The staff were kind of all over the place, and a little bit annoyed but they were teens so i didnt expect much.

The restaurant itself needs a cleanup, there was food on the floors, the windows were filthy, definite health code violations behind the kitchen doors. but hey the food was as good as mexican in cleveland is gonna get so i cant complain much right?

all in all you can feed a family of 4 for under $20 which is a win in my book!"}
{"text":"Chipotle?!  Pftftftft-- give me Chili Peppers ANYTIME over that place!!!
HUGE burritos with fresh, delicious ingredients!  The veggies are always full of flavor and the salsas really kick!  This place is GREAT!"}
{"text":"If you liked Que Tal, you'll love Chili Peppers. Much bigger selection than Chipotle has with the same sort of setup. They have a few different homemade soups on the menu - soup is always a plus in my book and mad props if it's homemade. 

Proprietors are very friendly and accomodating. 

I remember this place being an all night diner about 10 years ago. When I say remember.... well, I'm not really sure if that's the best word. I \"remember\" sitting in this very place being too drunk to eat my breakfast. I like Chili Pepper's much better than the place that previously occupied this joint."}
{"text":"I love Chili Peppers! Always a great place to stop in and get a burrito full of fresh delicious ingredients.  Tried my burrito grilled and it's the best way to go."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times. The set-up of the restaurant is similar to a Subway or Chipolte..  It is almost fast food restaurant.  There are meat options to fill your burrito: steak, chicken, hamburger.  Grilled vegs., and limes cost extra. We always get the Wet Burrito plate: burrito, rice, beans, onions.  You can get a Frequent buyer card and this is only good for Burrito plates.  The parking lot is small."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait after all the great reviews.  But what a disappointment!  Service fast , food cheap, but boring,  tasteless and no variety. In a bowl or a tortilla.  that was it.....not what I was hoping for.  Glad it's local and doing wel.but I'll go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"It surprised me how much I loved (and continue to love) Chili Peppers when I ate my first burrito. I had been to little independent burrito joints before, but nothing held a candle to the larger chain burritos. It was all limited ingredients that amount to mush. Enter Chili Peppers. The super-fresh ingredients come in a much larger (and more delicious) variety than that place owned by McD's. From the softly steamed tortillas, well-marinated meats and perfectly seasoned beans to the sweet-to-steamy selection of peppers and -- my favorite -- fresh cilantro, Chili Peppers is equipped and ready to make the best burrito you'll ever eat."}
{"text":"I think I have passed this place too many times and now regret not stopping earlier. After thinking \"I should try this place out\" pretty much every time I pass by, tonight I actually stopped and got take-out for dinner. Parked on the street right out front-went in-and went after the BYO burrito. Tried the chicken and my favorite additions...and added a few new ones. The selection of accessories to your meat and the sauces to mild or spice it up are excellent and abundant. I also like to dip chips in my burrito (don't judge). $.60 for a bag. Are you kidding me (in a good way)? Grabbed a side of guac and I was on my way. I was so excited about what was coming home with me...I could care less that I didn't realize I didn't have cash and had to hit the 7eleven atm up across the street. Note-check or cash-doesn't matter. Soooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place! The staff is fast and friendly. The ingredients are fresh. The grilled burrito has become my new favorite."}
{"text":"Good food. Not great, but nothing to really complain about. Very good service! Some stuff just a little bland."}
{"text":"Another great place on Collinwood. Like most of the people who've gone there it's like a fresh and healthy version of that major chain restaurant. No complaints on any of my many visits. The staff is great. Also, you get a card that they stamp for every burrito or burrito bowl you purchase. After ten stamps you next one is on them!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and very good. This is the same setup like Chipotle. The difference with this place is the food is authentic and very good. Chipotle has higher sodium in it. If your accustom to Chipotle this place food may taste bland to you. I would recommend this place over Chipotle."}
{"text":"Grilled build your own burrito is outstanding and simple. They have all the toppings you'd want and good nacho cheese. 

The service is wonderful and you can tell everyone is a hard worker.

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great establishment! Clean, friendly staff, fresh ingredients  (for the most part). Jessica is the greatest she pays attention to detail for my crazy metal allergy."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place at all. I ordered the steak burrito bowl and found it quite bland. The rice had very little flavor and was wet. The steak honestly tasted more like marinated beef (not flavorful nor tender). I paid extra for grilled veggies which was a disappointment. The veggies were overcooked and didn't look so fresh. All this was combined with their sour cream, cheese, and chunky hot sauce. It's far from the flavors that I'm used to finding in Mexican chain restaurants (Chipotle, Qdoba, etc)."}
{"text":"When I walked in the service door to the kitchen was open and I saw a worker pouring bleach I should have turned around then. But my thinking was \"wow this place is clean\" I stepped up to order and for some reason the guy making my chicken burrito was rushing me. I was the only one in there. I came straight from church to beat the crowd. I ordered a chicken burrito. When I got home and bit into it the chicken was old! It was hard and crunchy like it had been sitting out all day to dry. I will never go back to this place. I am very disappointed in the service and the quality of the food. One star is too generous of a rating."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Steve is great and always making sure customers are satisfied. The food is tasty, better priced than most chain burrito places and has one thing that sets them apart: Chorizo. 

My only concern when I go there is that I'm gonna splatter food all over me. They don't do a great job draining the juice out of beans and meats which cause burritos to become pretty sloppy. They could use a hotter sauce as well; their habanero sauce lacks a little kick. 

They do not take credit cards, I wanna say it's a bad thing, but if they took credit cards I'd be there a lot more often. Parking is never an issue and they always have 80's and 90's pop rock that takes me back in time. Their little punch card has gotten me a couple of free burritos as well."}
{"text":"This place is SMOKEN great!! I went there today with my boyfriend. I got a chicken taco and a steak taco. They were both fresh, delicious and made to order. My boyfriend got a burrito which was massive and also tasty. You can get the burrito grilled after being made if you want! The restaurant it self is clean and simple. No thrills but comfortable. There are booths in the back and tables all around. I highly suggest trying this place if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Basically a local version of Chipotle, but better.  On my most recent visit, one of my burritos was not placed in my bag (to go).  To make up for the oversight, they offered a free burrito on my next visit.

In addition, the employees are very friendly, and the food is pretty good.  This is exactly the kind of establishment that people in the area need to support."}
{"text":"Better than chit pot lee.  Flavor, yes. Sauce is actually HOT. COULD BE HOTTER YET ITS HOT.  Also they don't fill it up with rice."}
{"text":"Chili Peppers is a cool tanqueria on E.185th that is well worth the trip.  It will remind you quite a bit of the long gone Que Tal that used to be on Coventry a while ago.  Occupying two storefronts decorated in warm colors and south of the border decorations you can direct the construction of Burritos, Tacos, Quesidillias or bowls using quality ingredients, similar to the approach used by Chipotle, but with more flavorful results in my opinion.  

I ordered a vegetable burrito with refried and black beans, rice and the vegetable medley.  Of the toppings I would strongly recommend the sauteed onions and the guacamole, both of which are excellent; I also like the chipotle salsa which provides a nice smokey flavor with a good amount of heat.  The burrito itself is huge and it is well worth grabbing a bag of the freshly made tortilla chips, nice and crispy with the right amount of salt.

Chili Peppers provides a great local alternative to Chipotle, excellent food in large portions at a very reasonable price. If you are near E.185th and feel like getting some good Mexican food, give them a try."}
{"text":"Great fresh Mexican food with sounds of the islands. Definitely worth the trip. Very casual! Better than Chipotle. Hands down."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is always good and fresh. I have to get the home made chips and salsa no matter what I order."}
{"text":"Have been coming on and off for years and remember when they were in Cleveland Hts as Que Tal.  It is really one of those places that's not glitzy and flashy but serves excellent food. If you haven't been it is the same set up as other chain burrito places but they offer a better choice of fresh ingredients.  I have to say caramelized onions on a burrito adds such flavor and moisture if you haven't tried them don't be shy. They also offer fresh diced jalapeños and fresh cilantro for me these  make the burrito. They offer bowls actually served on plates or with the standard flour tortilla. They offer other items nothing fancy all food that can be made quickly so you can get in and out if your short on time. I went on a Wednesday about 11:30 for lunch and there is a steady stream of customers. The staff were very friendly and attentive.  If you are a Burrito fan and only go to the larger chains don't hesitate you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sorry Chilli Peppers, I really wanted to like you folks.

Wow I was expecting a great burrito.   This was utterly flavorless. I got the steak and both types of beans and a ton of toppings.  The meat tasted like something from a school cafeteria.  No flavor or salt.  The beans tasted like they just came out of a can. I took 3 bites and asked for my money back. I wanted to like this place but it was just plain awful.

on a side note the service was really friendly."}
{"text":"Truly as good as it gets for lunch food. Like Chipotle, but with a better selection of ingredients. It's a local neighborhood joint and you know its a good establishment because the same workers have been there the past 4 years.  Plus if you go in regularly, the owner recognizes you and gives you free chips.

It's also the perfect amount of food.  Where Chipotle leaves you too full and makes you sluggish in the afternoon, you eat one of these burritos and its actually energizing.

And while we're on comparison's to Chipotle, these guys take wayyyyy more pride in wrapping their burritos.  Many times a Chipotle brick will fall apart when you're eating it. This is tightly wrapped - you could throw it against the wall and it would stay intact.

Plus Plus you get an old-school Subway-style punch card to get a free burrito.

Love this joint."}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican after my son's baseball game. Checked out my favorite app to see what was around and found this gem. So good. My grandson said they were the best tacos he has ever had. Very similar style to Chipotle but better."}
{"text":"I get it. They're not Chipotle. . .

So I went to Chili Peppers after hearing so much hype about this place and I was so disappointed! I forgive the new guy for having to remake my \"Grilled burrito\" twice but the taste was truly unforgivable. To be honest this place has no business charging Chipotle prices. Immediately upon arrival and looking at the food behind the glass, the whole set up reminded me of a ghetto Chipotle. And they actually charged .50 cents more to have my burrito grilled . . . Okay, petty pricing. 
 The rice was so, so, and it look like brown rice. It didn't look appetizing at all. The onions were such a disappointment, I was very reluctant to try nearly caramelized  burnt (grilled, whatever) onions on my burrito but I gave it a go anyway and the combination proved to be a disaster. Sweet Slippery onions on a burrito yuck! I also got the black beans, tomatoes and fresh jalapeño. I asked the guy making my burrito which jalapeño where hotter because I had a choice between pickled and fresh jalapeño. He told me the fresh were hotter, and they were not! I even asked for extra, extra, extra hot sauce. I didn't dare go for the guacamole because it looked like store bought green puréed blob, no distinctive ingredients just specks of red. The only thing that I did like about this place was the meat selections. Maybe they should  focus more on the ingredients instead of multiple meat selections, which I'm sure is killing revenue. Also I didn't like how one of the female employees were talking to the new guy. She seemed to lack patience with him with her huffy demeanor as well as the way she had a snappy attitude with one of the other guys that actually knew what he was doing and he had to correct her. I think that there should be a certain kind of professionalism about the employees that work there especially in front of a customer. It was tacky to see that and it's actually bad customer service. Although she was nice to me, I felt like to talk to someone like that made feel like she's actually not a nice person at all.  After tasting my burrito I realized that it was mushy and bland, bland, bland,bland, bland! Thank God I had a lemon at home because it needed it sooo bad. At the end of the day, I didn't see what the fuss was about, the food wasn't that great, service was okay, I really didn't like the treatment of the employees there and please get rid of those onions, sauté in butter don't caramelized them. I will not be going back ever! Not even for a quick Chipotle fix."}
{"text":"Chili Peppers was started by the same folks that created Que Tal on Coventry Rd. in Cleveland Hts. I think Que Tal is gone now, but Chili Peppers keeps that original vibe."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time.  The set-up is similar to Chipotle, but I have to say their food is tastier.  I liked that they had a large selection of toppings, meat, and salsas.  The staff, including the owner, is extremely friendly.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice little spot close to work.  They open when they say the do and everything is fresh and ready to go!  I prefer to go anywhere other than Chipotle for my burrito needs.  McDonalds has enough money..  This place is very similar but with better choices and not so much pre-processed stuff.  They also have CHOPPED CILANTRO!  You would be suprised how many places dont do that.  Only think I dont dig is the \"bowl\" they use instead of a burrito shell is a frickin styrofome container and its a tad expensive for the small portions.."}
{"text":"UNREAL BURRITOS! Friendly staff and a great value.  The even come by to refill your glass.   This is a great independently owned place to go for a quick, healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Pretty decent quick service Mexican food. A TON more options than chipotle. I really like the quesadillas, they are pretty big, and the grilled burrito is also very good"}
{"text":"Best spot to go for a burrito! Get it grilled ;) and every 11th burrito is free with a stamp card, so if you're going as much as me it's a nice touch."}
{"text":"Not all that impressed. I have had better. It has potential, but the food was bland, and not exciting at all."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times for lunch and each time was great.  I prefer this over Chipotle or Qdoba because of the selection and the small town feel, but mostly because of the taste.  Do yourself a favor and stop in, pile it high, and enjoy.

This place is high on the lunch chart with all the guys here at work.  These grumpy old men have been on the Euclid lunch scene for an average of 30 years so take their word for it if mine is not good enough."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another shot as the hubs was hungry for some Mexican.  We both got barbacoa grilled burritos.  To up the seasoning and heat in my burrito, added extra cilantro, lime juice, fresh jalepeno and some habenero sauce.  SOOOO much better this time.  Will definitely patronize again after getting a good quality, moderately spicy Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Chilipeppers is the epitome of not judging a book by its cover or...the restaurant by its store front! Inside, this dingy looking spot is banging out the best quick Mexican food in the area for the price. Chipotle style ordering but fresh ingredients in their natural form, not covered in oils and butter. Tacos, burritos, enchiladas, bowls ...you name it. I always dig the build your own soft tacos with chicken and ally favorite fixin's. He's a big burrito guy with pork or steak or chicken...they are good. Homemade chips and salsa are perfect with the meal and their home made hot sauce will make any spice lover come back for more. I actually took a bottle home for $2.50 last time I was there. As an update...they now take credit card and have fish tacos on Fridays!! Highly recommend their chorizo also."}
{"text":"We never go wrong coming to Chili Peppers.  If you live anywhere near 185th, or in Euclid, you should be coming here. There is no way you should be wasting gas and time to drive to a Chipotle.  Support local businesses dammit! Eat at Chili Peppers!"}
{"text":"Yes!!! If you are thinking of trying it please do your tastebuds will be dancing. The food was full of flavor and very fresh. 
The service was great, the restaurant itself is old, lacks modern appeal but try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great for take out!
Reasonable, fresh, local, independent a must after those boring old wanna-be's chains!!!"}
{"text":"Custom burritos and hard/soft tacos--more or less like Chipotle but a) better and b) local! I still have to learn which fillings will make my dream burrito, but I liked the \"wet burrito\" I got, and with everything being custom to order, it's a great choice for vegans and vegetarians."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal,  staff is great! They move quick and the owner is a nice guy. I like this place us do much better than Chipotle"}
{"text":"Stopped by here Thursday evening for the first time. Pretty much set up like a fast food restaurant.  The woman behind the counter was very helpful and kind enough to explain the menu dishes. 

 I got the chicken quesadilla - mmmmmm, so cheesy and delicious.  For some reason, you're only allowed 2 items on the quesadilla (in addition to beans and rice).  Anything extra, you must pay for - ummmm, ok...."}
{"text":"A tasty and fresh version of chipotle/qdoba.  Fresh ingredients.  Grilled onions.  Chorizo as meat option.  Cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Drove past this restaurant so many times before actually stopping in and trying the food. Was incredibly impressed the first time I tried it out and since then have frequented there many times! I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and Chili Peppers definitely lived up to the hype. The service is very fast, especially since it gets very busy in there during peak times during the day. Great local food I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was looking for something to eat in Euclid and stumbled onto this review. Seen that folks mentioned this was the same as the old Quetal on Coventry. So me and the gf checked it out and DAAM! It is Quetal, just under another name. We were crushed when Quetal closed years ago on Coventry so finding this spot is GREAT! Much better than Chipotle and Qdoba! Quetal 2.0!"}
