{"text":"THE BEST coffee I have ever had in my life. Delicious breakfast. We had the layered apple pie, which I expected to be tastier than it looked. Charming atmosphere. We purchased some of their coffee to take home with us and I have been enjoying for a couple of weeks since!"}
{"text":"This place takes coffee making to the next level and transform it into an art form!! There are so many kinds and ways of drinking coffee in this café, all of which are not only delicious but exquisitely presented! To top it off the service is always fantastic and the food is amazing too! They definitely set the stage so to speak on \"the coffee experience\"! Try the Bolcino with a mountain load of sweet frothed milk or try your favourite bean variety served in your very own bodum... a real treat!!!!  Also bring your favourite beans home to prolong the loveliness!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a couple cappuccinos and were shocked at the prices. I don't think I've ever paid so much for an ordinary cappuccino before. It was more than $6 per coffee! The woman at the counter said it was Starbucks prices but the quality was better. But to us it tasted burnt, bitter and the milk was too hot. Looks cute inside and seemed like a cozy place to eat, with a good selection of pies."}
{"text":"Always great coffee, friendly service and good food.  Fabulous local staple!"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, smiling people, delicious food. A good brunch is a good start of the day. I ordered St So Waffles and my fiancé ordered Duo. Both are pretty good. It's just that the waitress did not tell us about the extra charge for maple syrup, so we got a little surprise on the bill. Overall, a must try in St Sauveur."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés après une sortie patinage au Park Molson et avons aimé la chaleur du lieu ainsi que le menu très large de boissons chaudes. Il y a 2 étages et pas mal de place donc meme en famille tout le monde y trouve son compte."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place in Saint Sauveur for a tea or coffee. Plenty of choices, vegan options and polite staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! There is nothing like it I have found in Texas. The waitress we got remembered our orders from the first time we went in and she was very helpful with choosing the right item. I know if I ever visit St. Sauveur I am going to go here everyday!   My food was delicious, service was outstanding, and during the breakfast hours every Breakfast meal comes with free drip coffee! HOLY MOLLY! Awesome! I got to try different blends as they change up the blends daily. So great!"}
{"text":"Une brulerie avec du café de qualité mais un décor brouillon. Les serveurs sont sympathiques mais expéditifs. Les gâteaux sont corrects mais ne valent pas leur prix. La crème chantilly de nos cafés n'avaient aucune saveur."}
{"text":"Cafe mocha was delicious and food was plentiful.  Our server was awesome and we really enjoyed the atmosphere as you walk into the coffee making."}
{"text":"Fast friendly great pies great coffee, it's a must if ur visiting the region 0 complaints"}
{"text":"Self made coffee beans, unique and smells so good! A good place for b breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop with a lovely terrace during the summer.   Also, they have various choices in their menu, which makes it so hard to choose because you really want to try everything!  If you ever go to St-Sauveur, you really should stop by and try something there, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We go here every time we're vacationing in the area. Why?  The coffee is punch a stranger in the spine good.  I bring an extra large carry-on bag to fill with pounds of coffee beans from the Brûlerie and then I give them to people back home as gifts and then they love me forever (because, duh, see previous comment in re: goodness level of coffee). The Obama blend is fantastic, and, hey, adorable, come on. This was the first time I'd noticed that particular gem. Our go-to has been Forêt Noire for a few years, but they always seem to have something exciting and new happening and the people who work here will hook your shit UP even if you have no idea what you want and you barely speak French and are staring blankly at their dauntingly massive list of blends and roasts and stuff.  The cafe/food part is awesome as well. This is a great place to go if your mom, for example, needs to consume giant, chocolate curl-ensconced, cinnamon-dusted, whipped cream-choked desserts masquerading as \"coffee drinks.\" I usually wind up having the same sandwich here and I forget what it's called but I'm pretty sure anything you eat here will be sprinkled with magical Canadian deliciousness and wonder.  Also, if you're an Anglo, the incredibly sweet and friendly staff will very patiently put up with your rusty, sputtering French, and even help you out when you desperately need to know comment dit-on \"MORE WHIPPED CREAM.\"  Lovely. Love them."}
{"text":"Place compact mais efficace , des sandwiches savoureux, chaud à l'interieur en hiver c'est reconfortant. Grosse varieté de boissons chaudes :)"}
