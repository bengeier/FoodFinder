{"text":"Great late night food joint. Got the chicken tenders and biscuit combo with fries. The portions are great and the food came really fast from uber eats. Can't wait to order from here again!"}
{"text":"Food is just as terrible as their grammar. Once got chicken there and it was made from spoiled chicken. Their fries are terrible, imagine McDonalds fries but soggy and no flavour."}
{"text":"Good place for the price. Got the philly cheese steak and I would give it a 4 out of 5; good value!"}
