{"text":"Awesome menu and bowl variety, love their eco friendly bowls as well! :) Not too spacious but food is good"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is super fresh. Staff is nice. Absolutely delicious..... recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I like it. We often get bowls from there, my wife really likes it. Everything is fresh and made to order. Only things that bother me are the absence of a kids menu, and I believe it's slightly overpriced... they should revise and I think they'll increase their popularity. But all in all a good option."}
{"text":"Poke bowls ... are very popular and healthy. Nice not have to drive to the city to have fresh poke bowls. The choices were very good. I have attached the menu . I ordered the Ahi Tuna which was very flavoured. Everything was fresh. My partner orders  the salmon bowl. Which she said was amazing. The only negatives was there is limited seating and the bowls were a little small. Overall it was great and we will be back."}
{"text":"My friend ordered the salmon and tuna salads for us, and it was amazing. Really flavourful, tastes pretty healthy and very filling. Unfortunately, my friend had the chicken salad, which she did not like as much. But I would eat here again."}
{"text":"First time here and ordered the chicken bowl. It was excellent! Just enough spice hint to make my mouth happy while I enjoyed the chicken, rice, corn, and all the other fresh additions. Good place. Will be back!"}
