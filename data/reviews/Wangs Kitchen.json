{"text":"While living in US Wangs was one place I really missed and once back it was the first restaurant I went. Their Hot and Sour soap, beef Chili, Chicken Manchurian and many other dishes are just awesome and very generous for the price. You have to understand that it is not the conventional Chinese but the Hakka or Bombay Chinese which is different from the regular mainstream Chinese restaurant and I like it better this way. I am always willing to go there and already have been dozens of times."}
{"text":"Amazing hakka food. I always get the prawn wasabi for appetizer. It has the right amount of spicy and I also get the dry beef chilli. I recommend this place if you haven't been yet."}
{"text":"Good food.. would be liked mostly by indians.. They cook good chinese stuff in Indian style.. loved the quality... Quantity of the portion is also good."}
{"text":"Based on reviews we decided to check this place out and were seriously disappointed. The chicken in both our dishes was all greasy leg meat. Gross. We barely touched our dinner and to be polite took the rest to go and gave it away. The only worse food I've paid for was in Cuba."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good non-vegetarian Indian or Hakka food in Mississauga, this is the place to go. They have good choices, the ambience of the place is good too.
The portions are big for the money you pay.
Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Chose Yay! I'm a fan but only of appetizers. Love Chilli Paneer and the soups lot better than Eddie's Wok or Ming's Room. Go for appetizers and take a large bowl of soup to make your meal :)"}
{"text":"Terrible!  Absolutely terrible!  I ordered Szechuan Hakka Noodles, which were basically spaghetti with tabasco sauce.  I ordered it with shrimp, got it without. Instead there 2 pieces of broccoli, an anise star and 4 pieces of hot pepper.  It was hot and completely flavourless 
I've lived in India for several months, and I have had great hakka food.  In Toronto I've had good and bad and decent hakka food.  This is by far the WORST!!!!"}
{"text":"Stay tuned. Trying it out tonight. ..

not too bad.  Not the greatest but it was good food at a reasonable price.  I might go back.  But its no Ming Room :("}
{"text":"I went to this place as they have advertised it as Hakka Chinese.  The food there is tasteless. I tried Schezwan rice and Chilli chicken .I would never recommend this place to any one."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the chinese indian style food. You get chicken lollypop here though the chicken pieces are small but they are good."}
{"text":"I was excited that I'll finally eat Manchurian and all but this place is not even average. I'll never visit this place again. I am sorry to say that. We ordered many things but didn't liked any item! These people!!!... they don't deliver there items properly too! We ordered something for delivery and they are charging $2 for each and every item for delivery and basic delivery charge was $5 and on adding 4 items the deliver charge was increasing by $2 on adding one item each time! And the girl over the phone was saying to skip some items so the delivery charges would be okay... Seriously?!? For paying the delivery charges we will order less dishes and be hungry?? So what's the use of ordering the food??? It's better to order something from some other restaurant! I'm just waiting that very soon this restaurant will be replaced by sone other good restaurant!"}
{"text":"We ordered lunch for work off the 'Business Combo'. This place has the worst food ever!!! 99% of my colleagues didn't like it, that 1% is the person who suggested this place. 
I got the szechuan chicken with vegetables hakka noodles, the noodles were like Mr. Noodle!!! I paid $9 to eat a pack of .25 cent Mr. Noodle! I can't believe people consider this chinese/hakka food. The portions were small too compared to the other chinese/hakka restaurants we usually order from, I got like 5-6 pieces of chicken, but regardless this place is a no, no and never eating anything from here again. Picture proves it."}
{"text":"My family often goes to Wang's Kitchen.  They have a good variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian options. I am vegetarian and generally order the same dishes every time:

Vegetarian Wonton soup - always a nice start

Crispy green vegetables - tossed with green chili and tangy soya sauce, a really great appetizer.  Spice rating: more on the mild side

Stuffed eggplant - battered and stuffed with mashed potatoes, tossed in spicy Hunan sauce.  Spice rating: Caution!

We tried a new dish afternoon: Spicy Basil Mushroom - quite tasty and not too spicy

For those who really enjoy spicy food, I would highly recommend 

Their fried ice cream desert drizzled with honey and cashews is also great way too cool off from the heat."}
{"text":"Excellent chinese food. Quick and easy ordering over Uber Eats and fast delivery.

Ordered a Dragon Chicken and it was mouth watering. I loved the hint of garlic in it. The Singapore Noodles was equally amazing."}
{"text":"The place is nice, food is good specially the hot & sour soup. The only thing is all the side plates don't have a lid and when they do the cleaning, the spray may go inside the container."}
{"text":"The only reason I give it a 3 star is because the food is good. Worst service ever. Everyone was complaining either orders were wrong or the lady just was not attending to the customers need on time."}
{"text":"The chicken lollipop was a little sweet and did not seem fresh; the bone was cold and the meat was warm - definitely microwaved. The manchow soup was OK. The pepper crab was the highlight; hot, had good flavour and was fresh. Service was a little slow"}
{"text":"The place is very tiny and there isn't much seating so you may have a tough time getting seating at lunch or dinner time. But regarding the food, its a nice fusion of Chinese and Indian dishes. A lot of the dishes are very spicy so you may need a lot of water and/or rice if you're not used to it.

Overall, I really enjoyed the place if you're looking for good, spicy Asian food."}
{"text":"This is our first time eating at Wangs and I must say that the food they serve has lots of potential. We had the sweet and sour chicken, spicy basil chicken, and the honey garlic lamb (dry cooked).. which was all a little small for the portion size considering how much it was priced.

My personal favourite was the spicy basil chicken, but in my opinion they should have a better type of cut chicken.. it would have been better than the thinly one we were served. 

The place was small, has adequate seating.. but poorly staffed. The place in general needs some update and thorough cleaning. I mean it. Plus, when we came in there was only one person taking orders, cleaning, and serving at the front. It came to a point that one customer had to get that person from the back kitchen because they were waiting on something. That shouldn't happen in restaurant standards. But its obvious the management needs to be sorted out.

This place wasn't busy mind you, but it is what it is. It has so much potential so am not sure if I'll be coming back any time soon. But we shall see, hopefully they get better!."}
{"text":"One of the best Hakka restaurants in the GTA area. Hakka cusine - Think of it as Chinese food with some Indian twists to it. Instead of the 2 min boiled rice they have the aromatic basmati rice. Also expect more garlic, ginger and green chilli flavor. And a tad bit more greasy. Try the chicken lollypop. Its a must. Also the chicken fried rice. If you like extra heat, go for the tsingha rice. The chicken Manchurian is the bomb. You have to try it to appreciate its real taste. Most of the things on their menu are good. And they have lunch specials on weekdays. They accept cards. 


Food : Good
Service :Fast
Ambiance : Casual
Worth the price : Yes"}
{"text":"Food taste great! But service is lacking. Always forget to give sides or drinks ordered. Beer is not chilled.  Not to expensive."}
{"text":"Only been here twice now I think.  Basic hakka food, definitely nothing to write home about.  The \"customer loyalty\" card is alright I guess, if you ate there 10 times you'd get $25 worth of takeout free.  Problem is the food just wasn't overly memorable to have me return 10 times..  Open later than the other hakka places in the area though, so thats a plus"}
{"text":"Staffs were friendly but they need to have more staffs to work. Only 2 servers and they had to do the cashier, clean the table, bring the food to the table, take the orders on site and on the phone.
The food was not so I would say the extra taste
It was just a regular fast food.
I saw a lot of people take the corn soup maybe something you might want to try if this is their specialty."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Hakka place in GTA, who would have thought Hakka can be flavourless?! Their chilli chicken was so dry and hot and sour soup was too thick to swallow, they might want to go easy on the corn flour. 

To top it off, worst service ever, not only the food took super long to come, our server was so rude and made it clear he hated being there. 

Definitely wont be returning here ever again!"}
{"text":"Food was alright.. Paneer chilly was the best.. Szechuan fried rice tasted as simple as steamed rice.. Had to return it.. Moreover the staff if very rude.. They charge for food that was returned wirhout eating as it was not good amd ask you \"dont  you want to pay the bill?\" Overall rating= poor to average"}
{"text":"I tried ordering delivery and it ended up being a 7 minute long phone call because he kept having to repeatedly ask someone in the background questions on a very simple order. After he finally had my order down, he told me that if I wanted the order total he would have to call me back in 5 minutes after he added it up and then we could place my order. He also asked me for my address when I placed the all and twice more after I had placed my order because he wasn't writing it down. This was honestly the most painful delivery call I have ever made. The food was alright. It's a miracle my order wasn't messed up."}
{"text":"Ordered Manchurian lamb and vegetable and some stir fried noodle .. i don't know where to start and how to describe. Just not what I enjoy and expected."}
{"text":"I have been to Wangs in the past. However my most recent experience has helped me decide to never come back again. 
The restaurant was near empty. There were more ppl working than customers during our meal. 
The notable item ordered was the Vegetable American chop suey. It was absolutely disturbing.it was sweet and sour sauce by the bowl. If you can, please do yourselves a favour and remove the dish from your menu."}
{"text":"Thinking we were having Chinese food it turned out to be Hakka.  Service was very slow we had to ask for water and utensils. Food was ok. I have had better. Would I go back?? Not really. 
The manchurian fish was the best. The lamb did not taste like lamb. So God knows what it was."}
{"text":"I must say this this place has really tasty food.  Caution some things are hotter than they seem on the menu.  If you can handle some heat, I recommend the lollipop chicken and the chilli chicken, they taste great!  The Manchow soup was good, but spicy!  The prices are decent too."}
