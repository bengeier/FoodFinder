{"text":"We really enjoyed it there last night with another couple.  We sat outside and it was very nice.  It got a bit noisy when the trains came by, but we like trains so that was not a problem for us.  The patio does face the street, and some  might not lke being that close to the street -- there were a lot of options inside.   We each sampled 3 wines (three two ounce pourts for $7.49).  The list was not large, but there was something there for everyone, and everyone settled on a glass of wine that they enjoyed.    We tried a couple of the different pizzas and they were very good too.  Mine had fresh basil -- and I know it was fresh because I saw our server picking it right before they made the pizza!    This is also \"Cupcake Binge.\" in the same facility.  I did not have a cupcake but everyone else said they were good.     We hope to go back -- it was very empty on a beautiful Saturday night -- hope they are able to generate some more business.  They were missing a few things on the menu, and our bill had a couple of errors, or I would have rated it at 5 stars.  Also, I asked for a glass of water  -- apparently you can only get water by the bottle (we were charged $1.00 per bottle).  Most wineries provide water in small cups at no cost."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced wine, good little pizzas and a few unique appetizers. I plan on going back."}
{"text":"Only tried this place once on a Friday night.   They had nice friendly service, average wines.   No flights only by the glass.   Atmosphere is lacking any interest or comfort.  It's echo-y and loud, cold.   There was a small party in the private room and then we were the only ones there.   Not sure we will go back with other wine bars so close."}
{"text":"So I can't rate this place based on food or drink or anything because me and a couple friends and my husband came here after work one day, mind you their website said they were open and if you call them their recording says their hours which say they are open, and they were closed. This is also attached to Cupcake Binge and I believe is probably the same owner. We were extremely disappointed. I just think if you are going to list your hours you should be open during them, that's all. I will not be going back, first because I don't believe in supporting a business that lies to it's customers, and second because you will never know when they will be open and I'm not wasting another trip."}
{"text":"Being the ridiculous insomniac that I am, the only way I can get to sleep is usually by drinking a strong glass of wine. In doing so, there's very few wineries I've not visited & even fewer I would return to. However, unWined is a place I can see myself frequenting :) It is truly unique & I mean that in the best way possible!   Our waitress, Amanda, was so adorable & perfectly attentive.  I did not catch the other womans name ( I think she might be the owner..she's Irish/Italian) but she was equally as pleasant and interesting to speak with. The atmosphere is bright, vibrant, & colorful- they have handmade games at some of the tables for anyone to enjoy, this really neat wall art piece made out of wine corks, and the food & wine selection was like nothing I've ever tried/seen before.   The wine list offered a delicious 'G-Forestglen Moscato' that I have never seen on any other wine list. You'll enjoy this greatly if you prefer sweet/white wines. My husband & I started off our adventure with the grape pizza & lemon ricotta; both starters were absolutely amazing! The lemon ricotta is light & refreshing while the pizza was sweet and tangy; delicious!!!! Yet these two plates made us even hungry for more & we ended up ordering the milk stout & 'small f/c & meat plate'; again, delicious! I can't wait to go back & try their pulled pork pizza & grandma cake :)"}
{"text":"I bought a gift certificate for my parents for Cupcake Binge/Unwined for their anniversary. When my parents went there, it was closed. This was two weeks after I bought the gift certificate. I have since emailed, called and sent a message on their facebook page and have gotten no reply. I understand they had a problem with their landlord, but they could have at least returned my calls/emails. Their website has stated since August that they are looking to reopen at another location, but now it is October and I guess I can say goodbye to my $50.00."}
