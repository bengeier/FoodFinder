{"text":"This little cafe is a Hidden Gem. It is much better than any of the other Casino cafes that I have ever tried as a matter of fact it has a much better quality food than chain restaurants in this town.  I opted for the Blue Plate special for Sunday night which was turkey mashed potatoes stuffing and a little side of cranberry $8.99. They also have an actual salad bar you can add for $2.50 if you having an entree it also includes soup I received three large slices of white meat real potatoes served up on the side delicious turkey gravy. Cocktails were only 350 for Smirnoff vodka soda. My companion had spaghetti and meatballs with a rich media tomato sauce delicious meatballs served over angel hair something like 6 bucks all in all the service was really prompt courteous and friendly.  I would like to see more people go here but I kind of want to keep it to myself."}
{"text":"I came to try something new and this tiny cafe inside Jokers wild casino seem to be a new option near my job,however i was disappointed from the moment i walked inn,poor costumer service,crowded (11 am) and somehow rude costumer service,lack of communication and Long Wait for food.i got to see other costumers which seem to be regulars here and got a whole different type of service(seniors most of them) cashier was also host and just told me to go seat,waiter took about 5muns to come by.at the end i got my food and it was ok. I hope they can give a lil more attention to the costumers!"}
{"text":"This place served me a chopped up hamburger patty when I ordered a Philly Cheessteak sandwich. The waiters argued with me that it was steak. I had to tell the manager (waiters summoned her-not me ). It looks like and tastes like a cheap chopped up burger. NOT a \"thinly sliced steak\" as the menu described. I told them to charge me for a salad that I ate and I wanted to leave. The manager did so. WTheF is wrong with the cook trying to pass off cheap hamburger as steak. IF it had been a Sirloin burger I would have ate it and left a bad review. As it was the Sandwich was disgusting and I did not eat it. The Cook really needs to be disciplined, retrained or transfered to housekeeping"}
{"text":"We barely made the 11AM cutoff for the breakfast special of 2 eggs, toast, bacon and hash browns.  My wife's $2.14 coffee exceeded the $1.89 cost of the special.  Service was very good as was the toast which arrived at our table both crispy and hot. The breakfast proved to be an outright bargain with my only quibble being the bacon could have been crispier.  ($7.70, 3 Forks)"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Service is down home & friendly! Craps are super cheap, too. Get there early!"}
{"text":"After 10pm menu was fair priced.  $5 steak and eggs, $5.45 1/2 lb. Burger.  Only 1 waitress made service a little slow, but OK."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, I only eat here once in awhile, cuz the food is very cheap, and taste ok.

The wait staff from about 11am on, are pretty nice. Before that time, get ready to deal with Dawn of The Living Dead. They're like pissed off zombies.. Which sucks cuz this place's best deal, is their \"before 11am, $2.49 breakfast.\"

I've had everything from their Eggs Benedict to their salad bar. Their salad bar is very basic. Cheap square croutons, fake Baco Bits, half-wilted(so take your time picking out the good lettuce, and leave the crap to another patron, haha) lettuce, and OK dressings. I get it. They can't have fresh stuff at this price.

Back to the Eggs Benedict. Everything on the Benny was cheap. The English muffin WASN'T TOASTED! Never seen that before. The hash browns were WAY too crispy.. Like eating unflavored Pop Rocks.. The Hollandaise sauce was just ok..

All in all, if you're very hungry and either cheap or on a budget, stop on in.. Then again, Sunset Station is close by, and their $7-8 buffet is way better!"}
{"text":"Food is nothing to right home about: standard, cheap casino breakfast, if a little below standard. The staff and ambiance are very pleasant: greeting almost everyone like an old friend when they come in."}
