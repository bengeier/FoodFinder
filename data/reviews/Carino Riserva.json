{"text":"Outstanding Meal!  Came here on Valentine's Day and had the set menu. This was truly delicious. Everything was cooked to perfection.  Cooked Italian risotto balls - Arancini, Tuna Poke, Prawns and Tagliatelle, Scallops with a tasty pan fried rice cake and truffle oil arugula salad, and banana strawberry roll cake for dessert. The presentations were beautiful and the food was really amazingly delicious.  The staff are already hitting their stride. Though the business has only been open for a few weeks or so, they really did an amazing job of this valentines dinner. We were asked how every course was and the staff obviously are very proud of what they have created. They were genuinily interested in our praise and feedback on the meal. The courses came out with a good rhythm. We were at dinner for 2 hours and for 5 courses that was just the perfect amount of time. It was a dining event and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great spot in 4th Street. Been here about 4 times and each time is excellent. This time has the Japanese steak and Egg for appetizer which was basically steak tartar with a Japanese kick (Wasabi for horseradish). Then had the Japanese Duck pasta which was actually Ramen style. Then the main was the scallops with risotto, best cooked scallops ever. Then for desert we had ice cream sandwiches.  The service is excellent. Will be going again in the near future. A complete gem in Calgary."}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday dinner here last night. Had the kaiseki tasting menu.  Toshi started us out with an amuse bouche of what looked like  a sushi roll. But it was topped with bruschetta and a perfect start to the evening.  Our appetizer as Panko crusted Brie served with sweet chili sauce and crisp bread. It was rich and tasty.  The pasta course was amazing, and our main, sublime.  Some of us had the scallops with crab risotto.  Others the lamb.  Both were delicious and succulent.  Dessert was a cake.  Light. Not oversweet.    I would go back to try their other dishes.  The serving staff were attentive.  Atmosphere was casual and relaxed.  A lovely evening, overall."}
{"text":"Small and cozy, close environment, a blend culture of japan and Italy. Interesting renovation of food. Ordered 2 appetizers as duck 2 ways, and beef carpaccio, 1 main dish of lamb rib 1dessert as matcha parfait. Lamb rib cooked as medium rare. Bill came about 68. The service is excellent. Food are fresh and cooked in time. Loved the experience, make sure you reserve the table before you go. Quite busy at night"}
{"text":"Every single time I've been to Carino Riserva (and Carino, when I lived in that neighbourhood) it's been life changing. Seriously. Blind pick any dish on the menu - every damn dish is INCREDIBLE. These folks could make your hockey socks taste good. I make involuntary happy grunting noises with every bite and I don't care at all. Also, ask the owner (if he's around) to pair wine for you. Mind blowing. I wish I could eat all of my meals for the rest of my life here."}
{"text":"A hidden jewel.  Amazing Italian Japanese restaurant.    Food was amazing and the service was very friendly.    Wine selection was excellent.  Highly recommended.    Bet reasonably priced as well.  A must go!"}
{"text":"Delicious spaghetti vongole and excellent service from the former Teatro sommelier who runs both the Carino on Edmonton Trail and this second iteration on 4th Street. A little gem of a restaurant in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Carino Riserva is a very quaint restaurant. I absolutely love the atmosphere as it really reminds me of Japan.  As soon as you walked in, all the staff greets you hello in Japanese.  When you leave you can definitely expect the same.  It's an open concept kitchen where you can see the chef preparing your meal. My grandma has a very strict low salt diet and the chef was very kind and had helped adjust our meals to accommodate her. I had the spicy duck, namba, with gnocchi as this dish combines everything I love: duck confit, gnocchi and soup! The truffle oil dashi soup was worldly even though it was quite salty. With that said, I do have a track record of finding Japanese noodle soup fairly salty so you can be the judge.  The soup also comes with a little dollop of Yuzu Kosho, a citrus and peppery paste that adds a pleasant kick to the broth.  Despite all the saltiness, Carino's bowl was highly memorable and I will continue to order and recommend it.  I also suggest ordering a few different dishes to share as their other menu item were delicious!  I will continue to be a fan of Carino. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Carino Bistro is like the Jake the Snake of Calgary's restaurant scene. They're not strolling about all 'roided and oiled up with whatever is left over in their pantry with 80's hair fashion scene draped over their scalps. No like Jake they simply cut a slick promo quoting the Bible with a cold dead eyed stare, stroll casually into the ring, drop somebody's head with a DDT, and dump a bag of snakes on their head. A pro-wrestling fan an art knows a master when they see.  And as a fine food fan I know when something beyond good work is being done.  Carino brings a whole show of their own with an Italian and French fused approach to Japanese food without any flash and flare. They brought forth amazing dishes what simple menu that constantly changes, evoking a tireless imagination. With Reserva, despite a more focused direction towards Italian style, they've maintain the same standard.  I'm not going to lie, I had no clue of Reserva's existence till we stumbled upon on it on a Saturday night because we were looking for a place to eat after Anejo (which I hate to say is the Ranchmans of Calgary's restaurants) gave us an hour wait time for a table for two. First of all, this is one bold area to be opening an Italian restaurant considering Bocce and Mercato  (and ok Famoso) are lurking nearby. I could have almost walked if my GF hadn't read \"Carino\" in the name. First of it's a small space, so small I'm surprised how they managed to fit a small dining space, an open kitchen, and two tiny bathrooms. I'm not even sure Starbucks could have managed with such a small space. Still the ambience was romantic, welcoming, and far from claustrophobic.  Because of the prices and our limited hunger, we decided to split our courses. We first started with the Hot Pot soup, which I could easily say is my favourite dish on their menu. It's evolved from the website's menu description as we were served a wonderful medley of fish, mussels, mushrooms, soft tofu, and the most well-crafted pillows of ricotta gnocchi. The broth was clean and fresh, but abundant in flavor that tied all it's accoutrements together. I've never imagined that soft tofu and gnocchi would find a rightful place in this light soup.   We also ordered a few sides. Bread with pesto and onigiri. The pesto was fresh and  seasoned perfectly that we would have smacked the person who dared to throw in a pinch of salt into it. The onigiri didn't make much of an impression with me but for its miniscule price, it was worth the try since you'd never find such an item with most Japanese/Japanese influence restaurants.  Next we had trout with crab risotto and mixed green salad. It was quite generous for a Secondi course this was quite generous considering all they could have given us was meat and veggies. The crab risotto was creamy and delicious though I have to be honest, wasn't the best risotto I've had in the city.  We didn't care much for dessert since we were stuffed, but from the looks of it, the dessert menu was strictly Italian, with the exception of match green tea ice cream. Next time, I'll be sure to try their tiramisu."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant in Mission.  Seafood is very fresh.  Appetizers and specials change daily.  Staff are friendly and knowledgeable and are very diligent in informing the chef of allergies. Atmosphere has a cozy charm to it with the high ceilings and open kitchen. We were quite suspicious of the fusion concept with Japanese and Italian.  They certainly pulled it off quite well for the selections that we had.  Very unique concept that is executed well. Started with Hamachi Cappaccio with taco chips.  Very tasty and fresh.  As was the seared salmon on a bed lettuce.  Flavours worked well with the balsamic vinegar reductions and salad.   We had the strip AAA loin steak with salad and fries.  Steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The accompanying sauce was excellent.  They gave soy sauce and wasabi dipping sauce also which was a bit unusual.  We preferred the side sauce instead.  They ensured that the allergy required plate was cared for eg. Instead of the regular side sauce which had dairy, they provided an equally non-dairy sauce.  They gave ketchup instead of the mayo  based sauce for the homemade fries.   We also snuck in the seared in butter  foie groie on the non-allergy steak  which was so tantalizing.  Note to self to get this with other entrees. The spaghetti seafood dish was very well done also.  Seafood was abundant and fresh.  Nice Asian take on the accompanied danshi bonito broth.   Prices were extremely  reasonable given the quality of food and detail to presentation.  Seems like a lot of great choices on the menu yet to try.  Enough selection to keep you wanting to come back to try for more yet not overwhelming.  Quality over quantity I think is their philosophy.  The chef has something good going here.  The seafood hot pot appetizer on the table beside us looked  really delicious for next time. As you finish off your chocolate salami that comes with the bill, one of the kitchen help and the waitress rush out to open the door and say thank you for  dining with them.  Cute. I think they will easily be the go to restaurant on 4th.  I'm curious about their sister Japanese restaurant in crescent heights on Edmonton Trail.  It should be a interesting place if the food is anywhere remotely as good as the one on 4th."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, Carino Riserva is one of the best and most unique restaurants in Calgary. I love the fact that my old hometown, despite its hundreds of Japanese restaurants, does not have something this awesome.  First of all, the prices are fantastic! $10 and $11 for a glass of wine (and none of that gosh awful generic cheap stuff you find at many ethnic places (e.g. Jackson Triggs, Coppermoon, Barefoot, Apothic, Oyster Bay).  The food is delish. Risotto balls, seafood pasta and duck confit with gnocchi were all excellent. The seafood in the pasta was fresh and the light broth sauce accented the shellfish. The two broths served with the duck confit and gnocchi were complex, intense and so insanely delicious, we drank every drop.  We left completely stuffed. The bill was about the same we would pay Craft or National.   The restaurant is small and not fancy, but that just adds to the charm. Attention is paid to the food, and you are not paying for the ambience."}
{"text":"Beautiful, delicious and creative food served by wonderful people. Carino is unpretentious and always welcoming - I love this place."}
{"text":"Came here for big taste Calgary 2016. What a great event to try new restaurants in Calgary. The dinner set menu was $35 for three course meal. You do have to book reservations; the place is small and was quite busy when we arrived.   Service was 5+/5. From the moment we walked in we were warmly greeted. Our waitress and waiter we so tentative and polite.   The restaurant atmosphere was 3/5. The place is small and our tables were too close to each other. The neighbouring table would comment on every dish we ordered. We could hear there conversation and I'm pretty sure they could hear us.   The food was a good portion. We started with a spicy tuna tartar it was fresh but could have been a bit colder since it was raw seafood. The second course was a wagyu beef skewer with campanelle with meat sauce. The beef skewers were so tender and perfectly seasoned but the pasta was a bit too sweet. Finally finished with a refreshing pink grapefruit gelee with yogurt sorbet with berries. What a great way to finish the meal. Overall the food was a 3.5 /5. I would come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great place for a date, small intimate restaurant with an open kitchen, good service and excellent food. I must admit I usually shy away from fusion restaurants so I was a little skeptical when I heard Italian/Japanese, however, I'm happy to report it was excellent. We started off with the spicy tuna carpaccio, great dish, the tuna has the right amount of spice and is mixed with a healthy amount of avocado and micro herbs. Second we noticed that you can add foie gras to any dish, each piece is $8, we also noticed that you can get a nice warm baguette, so we decided to get three pieces of foie and some baguette, best decision I've made in a while. The foie gras was accompanied by a sweet and spicy chilli sauce and a sweet balsamic and fried onion sauce on the side with a arugula salad. Simply put the foie on the baguette and enjoy - favourite bit of the meal by far. I finished the meal with the spaghetti alla pescatore, the seafood was very fresh and cooked perfectly. We had a $60 bottle of wine by the end of the night it was $150 for the two of us and worth every bit - I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Visited again to take out my best friend for her birthday dinner. Made reservations online and asked if they could provide candles/sparklers, and they called to follow up and let me know that they could, which was amazing :)  I had the gnocchi dish again which is amazing. Tons of cheesey goodness. We also had the penne, the seafood dish with risotto, and also the penne gratin. Everything was great, but the risotto with the seafood in particular was spectacular. The scallops were cooked just right and no funny rubbery like texture that most scallops give you.   Had the grapefruit dessert which was refreshing. The tiramisu was great too.   The staff here are so wonderful and really make you feel welcome. We ordered some wine by the glasses and they were very helpful in picking out what would suit your preferences and tastes. I can't rave enough about this place but I also kinda don't want too many people to find out about how great this place is because I don't want them to become too busy and overwhelmed! Definitely on my list of fav restaurants though, you can't go wrong with the food, atmosphere, or customer service here."}
{"text":"Great food with original and fresh ingredients. Cosy atmosphere. Probably the best service in Calgary."}
{"text":"Overall, the service was excellent. But I found the udon soup way too strong in flavor. So when I first started eating it tasted heavenly then quickly lost interest. In terms of pricing, I must say $15-20/ bowl of noodle is way too expensive. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Carino Riserva offers incredible service and their food is beyond amazing. We came here for my friend's birthday as a group of 5. You must make reservations as the dining room is small. It's open-kitchen concept so you can watch the chefs craft your masterpiece meal.   We started with the beef carpaccio and tuna poke and I had the duck confit with udon noodle soup. My table mates had the beef wagyu campanelle and duck breast. I have no complaints about any one of them! They also have seasonal specials written on the wall.   Fun fact: they use Sancho Japanese pepper powder in their duck confit broth and my partner learned this the hard way. While gulping his soup, he happened upon a sansho pepper \"powder ball\" and instantly had watery eyes and burning sinuses. Our server quickly inquired if he was OK, refilled his water and brought a scoop of gelato (on the house) to quench the heat. They joked about it to lighten the mood but also apologized.   We brought cake from outside for the birthday boy and after the staff sang \"Happy Birthday\" with us, our server surprisingly cut and plated slices for us, which almost never happens at any other restaurant. I was floored by the service and when we were the last ones to leave, the entire kitchen staff and servers followed us to the sidewalk and waved goodbye with many smiles and thank you's. This combination of hospitable service and great food is rare in Calgary. As a result, Carino deserves a spot in the Awesomest Restaurant That Almost Killed You Hall of Fame cause that's where they stand on my list."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and as mentioned before you definitely want to make reservations ahead of time since they are very small.  You can do so on OpenTable or call in for more than 4 people.  We started with the seared foie gras with fig balsamic jam and the chicken karaage (on special).  the foie gras was a bit confusing, the jam was a sweet and the foie gras was very rich.  There was a small salad with mixed greens and some orange slices on the side.  Overall this dish was very confusing and we really wished there was some kind of bread or a better vessel for the foie gras.  The fried chicken was great, barely any batter and was hot and fresh.  It came with a basil aioli/cream on the side which went great after squirting some lemon on top to finish.    We shared family style with two duck Nanban bowls (one with gnocchi and one with noodles), tagliatelle with sausage in rose sauce, campanelle with wagyu meat sauce and aglio olio linguine with crab and shrimp topped with tobiko (on special).  The Nanban gnocchi bowls were my favorite in terms of what fusion should be.  We got the spice on the side and it provided a great contrast to the amazing dashi based broth.  The broth was sweet, salty, spicy and packed with umami.  The gnocchi was light and pillowy.  Did I mention how good the broth was?  The tagliatelle was good and tasted like Italian sausage pasta. Nothing outstanding, but definitely a tasty dish.  But for me it was missing the fusion twist.  Same with the Campanelle which was also delicious (basically bolognese sauce using Wagyu beef).   The aglio olio seafood linguine was very good.  It incorporated some fusion elements (tobiko) which popped and provided a pleasant fishy aftertaste.  There was also broccoli was was an interesting element that was aesthetically pleasing, offering a contrast to the tobiko.    All the pastas were cooked perfectly in terms of bite and salt.  Everything was great, would come back to chug a bucket of that Nanban broth.  They also provided great service and also walk you out the door which is unique."}
{"text":"Interesting and delicious looking menu - gave me a hard time choosing but I ended up getting the scallops and risotto. Accompanied by good sake, great company and excellent service, we all enjoyed our meal.   The scallops were perfectly seared and cooked. Fantastic texture. The risotto was buttery, delicious, and abundant! Took half of it to go as it was quite rich. I will definitely be back to try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant that serves a mix of Japanese and Italian dishes. Tried out the ramen, and was impressed with the layers of flavours and freshness of the broth. The pork belly was like butter; super tender and full of flavour. Portions are generous, but it's so delicious you'll want more once you've drained the bowl!"}
