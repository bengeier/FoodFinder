{"text":"Ordered the stew chicken and it was a complete disappointment. The chicken was extremely dry and each bite-size piece was full of bones. The dish didn't taste fresh, and from the texture of the chicken it seemed the dish was old and overcooked. Even if the food was good, the price was steep compared to other (and better) Jamaican restaurants I've been to. Price for a large stew chicken dinner ($15) was definitely too much considered the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Good Caribbean food in Downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place was also once located at:   1780 Markham Road Toronto, ON M1B 2W2  Phone number  (647) 725-5323  Yelp: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/island-hot-and-spicy-toronto  Which is now closed. Same menu, same graphics and design, different locale."}
{"text":"I go to their location at Jane St. and Weston Rd. and take home an order of curry goat for $12 with rice and peas and vegetables. The goat falls off the bones and is delicious. There is some heat to the meal but nothing I would call spicy. The food, however is well heated through."}
