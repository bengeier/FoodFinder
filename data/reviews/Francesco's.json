{"text":"This place has REAL Italian food.  Its a small place on Route 51 that many drive by and not many know about.  From my understanding, they are reservation only, and for good reason.  Every time I eat there, there are only a couple parties seated in a tiny dining room, but the service is flawless.  The waiters and waitresses provide excellent service and the food is just amazing.  I never met or saw the chef, but I'm sure he takes a lot of pride in his work.  My personal favorite is the Carbonara - I don't think it gets any better.  If you are expecting Americanized Italian food along the lines of the Olive Garden, this place might not be for you.  This is real Italian cooking and I'm never disappointed.  Its worth the price and I try to get reservations every time I come back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to this restaurant for years. As far as Italian food goes, this place is the real deal.   The restaurant is not very large, but anytime I have gone I never had to wait for a table. I read from another review that you can only come here  by reservation only but that's not true. It's adorable and warm and cozy. There's family pictures of Big frank and his son all over the walls and they even have family photo books full of pictures from Italy.   Now on to the service and food.. The service is always great. The waitresses are friendly and one of the franks is always there. Last time I went, I went with my mom and dad for lunch. My dad ALWAYS orders the seafood Americana. The entree is not on the lunch menu but frank happily made the meal for my dad without my dad even asking.   We started off with the crab and feta triangles as an appetizer. Flaky triangles with real crab and a delicious feta cheese sauce. So good!   We also asked if we could have bread and salad even though they are typically served with dinner - they had no problem doing so for us. The bread is amazing and soft with a crusty top. The salad is awesome as well.   For my entree, I had the chicken portabella. Thinly sliced portabella mushrooms on top of baked chicken breast, topped with melted cheese. The red tomato sauce is incredible and they serve the lunch portion with a hefty amount of linguini. So amazing.   Although we were all full, you cannot come to Francesco's without having their cannoli. It's amazing. The filling is incredible.   Francesco's is perfect. The location is not ideal but once you get over that, you will want to return , trust me!"}
{"text":"This place has great food. I have tried almost everything on the menu.  My only complaint is that they make you feel weird to just walk in without a reservation."}
{"text":"Of course the one time I didn't check Yelp before my boyfriend suggested we have dinner here on Friday. If I had checked, I would have been prepared for the death stare we got when we told them we didn't make a reservation because we didn't know you had to. Mind you, the restaurant was half full, at best.   We were seated in a back corner (I always seem to get lucky with the most inconvenient and uncomfortable tables/booths; what's the deal with that?)  We got one salad and two plates so this place is like Olive Garden where you share a larger salad, and they give a balsamic dressing on top (no others).  They also provide a good size loaf of baked bread that they describe on the menu as garlic bread but it just tasted like butter and bread to me, I didn't taste any garlic or other seasonings. I got the pasta with Italian sausage & feta (cannot remember the name and cannot find a menu online to refresh my memory), and my boyfriend got a chicken dish. Both were simply excellent; hot,fresh, cooked to order, nice portions, and great presentation. I definitely think they were worth the 1.5 hour wait. (I think?) no seriously!  they were top notch Italian dishes and a lot of care was put into each one.   My only large qualm was briefly mentioned above: the dining room was 1/2 full and we waited 45 minutes for our salad & bread. Another 45 minutes for our entrees. When the entrees came, the waitress apologized for the wait, and listen, I want a good meal. I don't care if it takes a bit longer than usual  if it's fresh, cooked to order, and worth it in the end, which this was.   But honestly I just can't get over how long it took as well as the first impression of being made to feel so uncomfortable for not making a reservation. Just don't come here without calling first and don't come starving and you will be fine (haha you will be cranky!)"}
{"text":"This is the second time we went to Francesc's for our aniversery.  We were excted.  This experience was far from good.  Food quality is good. We couldn't complain.  Service was far from good.  It wasn't busy and it took an hour for our food.  We tried to present an Entertainment Book coupon and we were told they don't take it after a certain hour.  That's a lot of BS!  There was no fne print in the Entertainment book page saying this.  Guess this was a way for the restauraunt to rip off is patrons.  This is the last time we go here.  To bad, because it was close to home and the is good."}
{"text":"Carbonara was tasty. Chicken parm was also very good. The salad was standard italian fare. Warm bread and whipped butter was really really tasty. Very reasonable prices and famiky owned, better then any. Chain on route 51. Will come again. Desserts we passed on due to the fact the display was old limp dried out  presentation that looked prepared on Friday, we dined Sunday. I am sure the actual desse?ts were ptobably fresh but the display was off putting. Server was friendly and place was clean and inviting. Overall a great evening"}
{"text":"While on vacation, we found Francesco's on Yelp. Our meal began with a hair in my salad bowl (perhaps an eyebrow). I asked for and was given a new bowl, and despite my inclination to leave right away, we all ordered linguine. My friend (who is a vegetarian) and I ordered linguine with tomato sauce (as listed on the menu). After my first bite, I realized that the tomato sauce had meat in it. I immediately told my friend, who fortunately had only taken one small bite. When we asked our server about it, she told us that it was an Italian restaurant, and \"all Italian restaurants have meat in their tomato sauce.\" My friend decided not to order anything, and when our check arrived, our server told us that they had only charged for half my friend's meal \"since the cook had to make it.\" She suggested that it was my friend's fault for not telling her that he was a vegetarian. I told the server that the menu should not say tomato sauce if it includes meat, but she still charged my friend for half of the meal. We will not be going back to Francesco's, and I would recommend others to find a different Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"The owner (big Frank) came the USA when he was 12 after his father died and the food reflects this. The huge home-made beef ravioli are an absolute treat ($13 with salad and bread) as are most of the entrees.  Prices for the specials tend to push $20, but most are very good. The homemade Tiramisu is heaven on a plate with layers of marscapone that melt in you mouth. The house salad is a nice mixture of greens with their signature balsamic vinaigrette and very good. They do some interesting sides like spaghetti squash in the fall or melon soup in the summer.  The wine is a bit pricey by the glass, but my biggest gripe is that they aren't very accommodating of allergies so if you have a soy allergy and cannot eat margarine or vegetable oil and ask for them to cook your entree with butter or pure olive oil, you may be out of luck depending on the mood of the staff.  Otherwise, Buon Appetito!"}
