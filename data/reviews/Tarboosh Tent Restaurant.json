{"text":"Great place to get some middle eastern food!  Had everything from its buffet to its sandwiches.  The service is friendly and the food is absolutely delish."}
{"text":"Great place for middle eastern favourites (taboli, hummus, kibbi)"}
{"text":"The fact that the place looks half empty any time we have walked by discouraged us from trying it.  Wow what a pleasant surprise!! The lentil soup and hummus plate was fresh and delicious.    The falafel sandwich was fresh and not full of lettuce as is often the case.  The beef shawarma platter was very tasty with an authentic fatoush salad and Lebanese rice sides.  I would come back again and recommend it to anyone looking for middle eastern food.  This is far better than the Montfort on Iroquois."}
