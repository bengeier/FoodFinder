{"text":"I love this course. Play it because ASU is tearing Jarsten down sometime in the future. I would give it 5 stars but I am a little annoyed with management. When I play there in the summer with a discounted rate I expect the course to be stacked... This is somewhat acceptable.  When I pay winter prices I don't expect to be stacked up and standing around for 15 minutes on each tee box..."}
{"text":"$40 to play in July is doable if your course is in play worthy shape. When a course loses its greens the prices should reflect that OR the clubhouse guys should give everyone a heads up. We would have decided not to play at all. I really like this course but the shape that it's currently in is beyond bad."}
{"text":"Can see the shadows of greatness that once was the Karsten course.  Now,  sitting on death row,  the love, care and maintenance that once made this course great is gone.  While sad,  maybe the best thing to do is pull the plug on the life support and put the course out of its misery."}
{"text":"This course is in terrible shape. Played and didn't see one person working on course. the grass is like a cow pasture overseeded just around greens. Charge way to much for what it is. Will not be back. Carts are junk. suspension shot. more water on cart path then on course. Should be ashamed of this condition"}
{"text":"Sad that this once great Course is a pile of crap. No grass to be found on the greens. Pace of play is terrible. Played 3 holes in an hour and waiting on a par 4 tee that is two deep.   This course isn't worth paying $10 for. Pete Dye would be ashamed to associate his name with this dog track.   Heard that ASU is tearing it down to build buildings. You can tell. The place hasn't seen water in days.   Stay away from this place at all costs."}
