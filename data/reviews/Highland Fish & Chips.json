{"text":"Very good fish and chips. Ordered the haddock and chips with cosslaw bread and dessert. Amazing service."}
{"text":"Perfection.  You would think that cooking a good piece of fish is not that difficult but many restaurants can't seem to get it right.  Highland Fish & Chips have been around forever and that experience really shows in their food.  I had the halibut and chips and my meals was absolutely delicious.  The staff are somewhat friendly and a little rough around the edges but the food makes up for anything lacking in the ambiance.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Cod and chips as recommended by the staff, was told it has the most fish taste despite being the cheapest option. They also have halibut and haddock. I ordered the takeaway option - cheaper than dining in. This place is pretty much like the British fish n chips store they wrap your fish n chips in paper. Taste? OMG. I never liked fish and chips before because i cant find any good in them batter always thick. But this is out of the world, not only was it very thin but so crispy!! The fish is so moist! They made it just cooked not under or over done! Excellent! I will come again personally this place is underrated because of its location! You all should try it and let me know how it taste for u."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips plus friendly service. However you should bring cash I don't think they have electronic devices."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was in highschool! Living in highland creek, it is super close and their fish and chips are awesome. I love their fries and I also frequently get their shrimp and chips. You normally get 8 pieces of shrimp which are heavily battered. I like to peel the batter off and eat the perfectly cook shrimp inside. It is a bit greasy though but smothering it in tar-tar sauce is my absolutely favourite. If you like tar-tar sauce, be aware they charge you 25cents for 3 packets!"}
{"text":"Went here a while back ago but I remember it was really good. Prices from what I remember was around $7 but you do get a considerable amount of food. Only problem I had was the amount of oil the used to cook the fish and the fries."}
{"text":"The best fish and chips I had!! It's cheap and delicious The restaurant has been there for ages, and the fish is fresh and has A LOT OF FRIES. Halibut, scallop and the meat pie with gravy are my favorites Also...  (Spoiler alert: you might only see old people sitting around eating haha)"}
{"text":"I love the fish and chips here - the haddock, halibut and cod are all excellent choices. Just the right amount of batter. Excellent fries too! I've tried the chicken fingers too -- yummm . Great place to go!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and I am very very happy to have found another wonderful Fish & Chips joint in the area.  The place had a dining area as well as a take-out area, which gave it a really nice setup.  One thing that was unfortunate was the fact that they only accept credit cards and cash.  Not that it would stop me from going back.    Halibut - Was a pretty good size with a good amount of batter, although a little bit on the greasier side.  Regardless, the fish was nicely fried and was very flaky. I would definitely order this again. 5/5.  Fries - Fresh cut fries, cooked to perfection.  I'm sure if you eat-in, they would be nice and crispy, though I don't mind the softer kind either. It's the type of fries you'd love to have as a poutine.  5/5.  Gravy - First of all, for its price, the size is very generous.  Plus, it is absolutely delicious.  They would definitely have a mean poutine if they had it.  I think the next time I see some curds at the grocery store, I would make my own poutine with their fries and gravy. 5/5."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, it doesn't seem much because the restaurant is behind a second door but when you see the actual restaurant, you'll fall in love. It's so old-school cute but clean at the same time. The service is great and it's a small intimate environment. The fish and chips are delicious, I ordered the Halibut and chips. I also ordered the steak pie but that was too oily for me. I definitely recommend this restaurant, it's my favourite fish and chips place so far in the GTA. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Highland Fish & Chips visited on Friday March 23, 2018  Due to it being the season of Lent, my wife and I decided once again on a Friday to go for fish and chips.  We've known about Highland Fish & Chips for a while, I've visited for take-out 2 times before even before they started accepting Interac. My previous 2 visits were strictly cash-only!!  Had to plan ahead before coming here, since I usually don't carry that much cash on hand. At least as of our visit yesterday, we were happy to learn they finally now accept Debit payments.  At the time of our visited the dining room was really full.  Luckily we were able to snag a table for 2. Service was quite good for the time of it being really busy.  We ordered the Fisherman's Platter (3 shrimps, 3 scallops and 3-4 pce of fish),  1/2 order of onion rings and a Caesar salad.  We had requested the fries and fish to be extra crispy, turns out everything but the fries arrived extra crispy, including the onion rings.  Now, all the food was okay, I'd say around 3 outta 5 stars.  The reason for the reduction of 2 stars was, at least for our palette, the batter being too oily.  In the event that the fried goodies were also salty, I would have deducted another star.  Normally I don't have to use malt vinegar or the lemon (which was the squeeze bottle lemon extract), but this time I had no choice, I had a difficult time eating the fried fish portions without it.  My wife and I shared the Fisherman's Platter..else I would not have been able to finish it.  My wife had commented also that the batter on the shrimp and scallop was oily enough to leave a film behind on her lips.  I felt the oil from the batter leave residue on my tongue and the roof of my mouth.  Also, for portioning, it seemed a bit on the small side (fisherman's platter) for the amount of $21, not enough fries in my opinion, the scallops and shrimps were decently sized, just felt not enough for price paid,  1/2 order of onion rings was a lot, enough for my wife and I to share, we had also shared the Caesar salad.  Wife felt that the Caesar salad portion size was a bit on the small size for the price paid.    No real complaints on the onion rings (really good when asked for extra crispy).  As for a future visit, I did over hear from another table that Highland Fish and Chips does offer a \"light\" batter option, so my wife and I will return to try out their \"light batter\" option. If this fails our hopes, likely we shall not be making a return visit.  cash/debit/credit card payment available  Our current go to spot for Fish and Chips for the last 3 previous Friday's of this 2018 Lent season has been Painted Post Fish and Chips, batter on fish is much lighter and no oily side effect after the meal."}
{"text":"Meh, don't know what the hype is. Nothing really special about this place. For some reason during dinner time there are a lot of seniors here. Maybe those are the people grew up on Fish & Chips."}
{"text":"Better than London!  This place has the best fish and chips I've ever had(along with Flippers fish house).  The batter is light, not greasy and the halibut is so dense and flavourful.  Their hand cut fries are also delicious and perfectly cooked.  The best part about their fish is that you never see or taste the mushy slimy part of the fish that I find too often in fish and chip places.  The quality they use is the best."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood joint.  The service is always quick and it's a great place to go for lunch with your paper on the weekends.  This place is a Highland Creek gem and has been serving customers for 20+ years. The portions are huge."}
{"text":"Hands down best fish n chips I've ever had. This place has been there since I was born and I've moved to the US already and have not found a place better than here.  The batter they use complements with their fish very well. Most places have a clear taste distinction from the batter to the fish and sometimes if not done properly, the uncooked batter/mush between the crust and the fish.  They have cod, haddock, and halibut respectively. Typically I get Cod and Halibut. Haven't tried the haddock but I'm sure it's really good. Be sure to get lots of tartar sauce and ketchup from them! I really love their tartar  sauce, well it's not really from them but they get it from someone else but it's really good. It has a nice sweet flavour to it that I rarely encounter when having tartar sauce.  Their fries are also very good. This is a small business so best to pay in cash over here.   Definitely if you want awesome fish and chips, this is THE place to go to for it. I usually get it to go as it's nearby for me but you could also eat in, usually it's lots of elders who eat here who have been going to this place for food for as long as they could remember. Definitely a hole in the wall that no one really knows about."}
{"text":"We eat here because it is close to home. I find the fish a little dry but the portions are generous and the waitresses are very friendly."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon, but I have had greasier,. Fish was dry, fries were cold, gravy good. Cash only, friendly, cozy place, but a little cold inside. They short changed me two dollars. When I asked for a receipt they gave me a torn off tab. The receipt said $7 they charged me $13.90 and the fish only came out to $10 plus tax. Not a good way to do business. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here off on a search for the City's best Fish and Chips. Yet quickly to realize this place is a huge disappointment despite the decent reviews already given on Yelp.  Couldn't even provide clean, drinkable water. Cup smelled terrible, and water had an odd taste similar to mop water.  Furniture is hideous, they literally have a carpet cutout stuck onto the wall. Service was quite normal, nothing too special.   One redeeming feature was the fresh quality of the fish. Batter was decently light, yet a downside is the lack of fresh lemon, provided by bottled lemon juice bought from supermarkets. Odd tasting ketchup, and pre packaged tartare sauce.   Overall, would not come here again."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful battered fish - light, crispy and not too greasy! I was told I could have ordered 'light' batter which has an even thinner coating, so I'll have to try that on my next visit. Not as big a fan of the beets or chips but it was alright, probably quite authentic if you like that kind of thing..  I don't know if it makes a difference regarding the freshness of the fish, but our visit was on a Friday which happens to be a good 'turnover' day. The lady who served us was quite friendly and the service was excellent. We will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I'm always reluctant to give 5 star reviews but you know what, this place deserves it.  Highland is very much the local fish and chip place that has been making f&c the right way for a long time. I ordered the cod (not only because it's traditional, it also happened to be the cheapest fish) and it was great. The fish was moist and not overcooked and the batter was crispy not greasy and had great flavour to it. The fries, again, traditional hand cut and properly cooked and not greasy at all.   I was recommended by an English friend of mine to eat f&c with mushy peas and I was happy to see that they had it on the menu so of course I ordered it. This was the first time I tried mushy peas and even though the name doesn't sound very appealing I enjoyed it and if I ever see mushy peas on the menu I'll opt for it instead of cole slaw from now on.  Service was friendly, prices very reasonable and the place itself has a very homey feel, right down to the hand knit tea cosy when you order tea (English breakfast, of course). If I have have complaint is that it's kinda far from me, being all the way out in the outskirts of Scarborough. More of a reason to visit my sis and bro-in-law out there I guess :)"}
{"text":"AJ & I really like going into this nice neighbourhood restaurant the server is so nice. Although we often look at the menu to try something different which I am sure is good like the steak pie, scallops or shrimp we still always order halibut and chips.  You just have to remember to bring cash with you no credit or debit."}
{"text":"\"What's for lunch?\" I looked on my phone and scrolled, trying to place a place to eat after that boring class. Sandwich? Nah, not fulfilling enough. Go home and make my own? Too much work so no thanks. Then I saw the suggestion for fish and chips. Bingo.   Lets do this in point style: 1. The fish was amazing. It was golden brown and crispy on the outside, moist and soft on the inside. Drizzle few drops of lemon juice (they use bottled lemon juice, not fresh lemon, -0.5 point) and tartar sauce on top, perfect.   2. For me, the fries were a little over fried so they look darker than I preferred. But with fish that amazing, it's something I can over look.   3. Debit/interac are not accepted there, so have your credit card or cash ready. It was 20 bucks for two pieces of fish plus chips. Not the best deal I've had but still in the acceptable range.   4. I went there at noon on Thursday, mostly empty  with a few other customers sitting in the corner. The atmosphere was peace and quiet, perfect for people like me who eats alone."}
{"text":"When you walk in, it's a tight space with a bench and and a counter with the kitchen behind. It doesn't seem like much at first, but it's really a hidden gem. My partner and I ordered 2 orders of haddock and chips for take out which were placed in boxes and wrapped in paper. Once we got home, we devoured the food and it was oh so good! It was my boyfriend's first time having fish and chips and he was afraid that he wouldn't like it because it would be \"too fishy\" but even he loved the flavour of the fish as it was light and not overpowering! If you're afraid of trying fish and chips because you don't like fish or the taste of fish, I would still recommend you try it! I give this place 4 stars as opposed to 5 because even though the fish was awesome, I felt that the chips were a bit bland and could've used some salt or other seasoning to really give it some flavour."}
{"text":"Highland Fish and Chips offers excellent fish and chips.  Wowie.  Went in for a quick Friday afternoon take out and boy oh boy, I guess I'm not going back to Malt n Salt after this experience.  Granted, Malt n Salt is so much closer to home but for HFC's light and crispy battered haddock and cod, I'm willing to do the extra 8 min drive.    I ordered a haddock and chips and a cod and chips and added an extra piece of fish to both orders.  People, unless you're a seriously big eater, do not do this.  My husband who loves anything fried, could barely finish his order and I gave up after half way into my second piece of fish.  Their chips, although quiet good, ended up getting neglected and a lot of them just got tossed at the end of the meal.    Both fish were battered and fried to order in HFC's light and crispy batter.  Two things I really dislike in fish and chips, one being thick heavy batter (which usually makes for too oily a fish) and the other being unnaturally formed (you know the perfect square kind), HFC is neither.  You can see the lady manning the deep fryer as she drops each fillet of freshly battered fish gingerly into the hot oil.  The fish comes out nice and light and perfectly yummy.  Their chips were double fried goodness also.   I think this experience could have only been better had we actually ate them on the spot in their dining room.  Will definitely try that next time.    Minus 1 points for using tartar sauce packets.  I know, I know, not too many places make their own tartar sauce but I still can't get used to the idea of serving such superior fish and chips with your run of the mill tartar sauce out of packets."}
{"text":"I live very close by and the atmosphere is so welcoming and friendly. I am not a fish lover, but the place knows what they are doing. Would totally recommend. The owners are amazing too, every sweet and friendly to me!"}
{"text":"This fish & chips joint has been keeping customers in Scarborough happy for decades. Great fish & chips, especially the halibut, and make sure you get some gravy for your fries. It's delish!  Take out is quick and the staff are all very friendly. Dining room is a decent size but arrive early if you want a table on Friday nights because it is always busy."}
{"text":"I was a student at UofT Scarborough (UTSC), so I was REALLY close to this restaurant. It's also 30 seconds away from the outer parking lots.  The manager of the print shop at UTSC (my ex-boss) always recommends this place and takes his crew there for lunches... so I went on my own one day for takeout (although he did take me and coworkers out to lunch here some time after).  The lady, after giving me my order, saw me fussing around with the takeout box (which was inside a brown paper bag). I explained to her that I was going to be eating while driving. So she was like, \"OH! Well, THAT won't do.\" and she snatched the bag from me and ripped the top to make a bigger opening.   Which was so sweet of her! She's so cute!  The food was absolutely delicious and SO MUCH, especially for $9. I think I paid $9.... I forgot. I ordered the cheapest one, __sometypeoffish__ and chips plus gravy.   I've been back here quick often since :) A pleasant experience every time! And I NEVER finish my food here!! Dingy looking place.. I actually didn't like the halibut, but I know a lot of people who recommend that. My ex-boss definitely loves the halibut.  Never tried anything other than the first three items (just fish and chips) on the menu."}
