{"text":"Morning breakfast buffet is good and staff is very courteous. The view of the stadium is amazing as the restaurant is part of the stadium, which was pretty awesome. Great place to go if you like baseball"}
{"text":"Jays Jays Jays and the grub is not bad!  Prime Rib was good, chix was good!  Drink could be better!  I had a Moscow mule with so much ginger- yuck!  Try the nachos for game day!"}
{"text":"1 star for decent food. Besides that, don't know what I can say right now.  We waited 1h 45min for our entrees from the time we put our orders in. 

Manager and staff just gave us a bunch of excuses.  Exact words out of the manager's mouth, 'Is it your first time here?  We should've warned you that service is always slow on game nights.'  Really?  81 home games in a baseball season for how many years and you still haven't learned and is 'slow' every game?

Couple of us in our group have years of working in the restaurant industry, which typically makes them sympathetic to the challenges in this business. However, we all felt the service and the responses have been unacceptable."}
{"text":"While browsing LivingSocial.com, I stumbled upon an interesting deal, $25 for $50 off at Arriba, the restaurant at the Roger's Centre. Not only does Arriba offer delicious food but it provides guests with a fantastic view of the baseball stadium where you can watch the Jays in action. 

The atmosphere was average but l did appreciate the orchids found on each table. Customers are encouraged to watch the entire Jays' game even when all the food has been cleared.  You can also watch the game on the flat screen television sets for the commentary and replays (since we all know games at the stadium only show replays when a Jays' player hits the ball). It would be nice if the volume was a bit louder but I do understand that not all the customers are there to watch a game.

Starters - Crab Cakes, Fried Calamari
Entrée - Black Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Tomato Linguine
Dessert - Crème Brule Cheesecake, Warm Chocolate Brownie

The fried calamari was different from the other restaurants I have been to.  They were lightly battered as if they gently dabbed the calamari in the batter providing a delicate sensation.  The mixed greens and sauces complimented the starters wonderfully. The crab cakes were great but I feel like they could have done more. The presentation was quite disappointing as it looked like someone just dumped a few greens on top. The entrée was rich and savoury - I absolutely loved the tomatoes! I enjoyed the crème brule cheesecake but my friend preferred the brownie. I expected the vanilla ice cream scoop on the brownie to be larger and while viewing pictures from other Yelp users, I was surprised our brownie was half the size of their's. Both desserts were garnished with juicy mixed berries.

Overall, I would come here again. The price is great for the level of skill and presentation in their dishes."}
{"text":"Horrible service on October 3 2012

We went there for the jays last game 
Yes we did use a Dealicious coupon 
After we sat down for over 15 minutes , we did not even get a glass of water 
The other server was going from table to table but not one soul asked us what we want. Finally I stopped this server who was two feet away from us but walked by us many times 
He grudgingly said that I am not your sever and went to the back 
After a few minutes a young fresh faced server came out and asked us what we want. We felt bad that she was almost pushed out from the back 

Btw Arriba was not full 
Finally we ordered our food and the young lady had no clue what the special was. We had mussels as appetizer . It came out totally overdone and cool, even though it was supposed to be steamed. There was no steam. The pulled pork snider were passable. We ordered wings and chicken for entrees. The wings were salty and oily 
Please note that the mussels was $15 , the wings were $25

No one came back to see if we need anything 
We found a bus boy to give us water 

The manager came out to do her rounds but she did not bother asking us 

Why? We did not order enough alcohol

I don't think we can ever call this service 

Either they need better training or may be assign the customers somewhere else"}
{"text":"Took our son there for his birthday lunch.  Expected a great baseball game, but didn't expect much on food or service when we walked in, but surprise, the food was actually quite good.  Bread comes with hummus - bonus.  The service was 5-star! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Arriba's Winterlicious menu a few weeks ago. Making reservations was easy using the OpenTable app. 

We were a party of 4 and our 3 course dinners included the quiche, chowder, braised ribs, salmon, sorbet, carrot cake and bread pudding. Some of us ordered the same dishes. The food was absolutely delicious! The serving size was perfect and we all cleaned our plates without leaving any food behind or feeling hungry. 

Our waitress was great. She was pleasant and attentive, yet not hovering. The perfect balance of providing great service and still giving us privacy. 

There are a lot of tables that have a great view that overlooks the Rogers Center. We'll definitely be coming back in the summer to have lunch or dinner while watching a Blue Jays game!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant for any sports fan.  If you're going during a sports event, book early to get a window seat.  The view is amazing, it's like having free tickets to the game.  

The food is great, although somewhat overpriced.  The service is friendly and the washrooms clean. 
 
Very highly recommended during a ball game, slightly recommended otherwise."}
{"text":"Had an awesome view of the field! I loved the Prime rib and the service was top notch! Big thanks to Janice our server. She was kind, funny, friendly and professional. The Exec Chef Dave, (I think) came and stopped by to check on us and Craig the bartender was a sassy and skilled mixologist! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"It's a Saturday night with the window seat looking down the Blue Jay practicing on the field.  Quite a number of people in the bar but only a few dining tables.  The waiter is very friendly and initially thought we are tourists with our camera.  We start with Mussels that is very tasty.  Portion is big.  The Tiger Shrimp Linguini is perfect, except that it seems to have more oil that makes it very stuffy.  The shrimps are done just right.  The burger with AAA Angus beef is one of the best.  It is tender, juicy and big and it comes with a salad.  With the tea and coffee complete the tasty dinner.

The environment is nice, the service is good and with a bird eye view on the Dome makes the dinner different and cozy.  We stay there chatting for quite a while and the waiter comes and gives us more tea to have us enjoying a good time."}
{"text":"Me and my family went here because we got a package deal for a 3 course meal and a view to see the jays game. The view is great huge glass windows right above the field. We all ordered our meals at once and then they brought out our food progressively. 
The food: I ordered the mixed greens salad which was decent, needed a bit more dressing and was a bit lacking in ingredients (just had mixed greens, almonds and goat cheese), my mom had the mussels which she really enjoyed and my boyfriend had the artichoke and asiago dip which he didn't comment on but he ate it all so I'm assuming it was at least decent. 
For the main I had the pulled pork sandwich, they tried to class it up by adding cheese and arugula ont he sandwich but it was missing the classic smoky flavour that pulled pork has, however it was tasty. My mom had the pasta with shrimp and mussels (yes she likes mussels) with a tomato cream sauce which she said she throughly enjoyed. My boyfriend had a beautiful plate of pickerel with risotto with peas and carrots it looked gorgeous and he loved it. 
Dessert, I had the bread pudding (see photo) omg SO GOOD, my boyfriend had the creme brulee cheesecake which he loved and my mom had the raspberry sorbet which she didn't finish but they gave a large portion. 
Overall the food was a 7 out of 10 for me. 
The Decor: Beautiful, I loved all the colours the tables where plain white but all the furniture was crazy vibrant colours - i.e. lime green, bright orange and blue. It was great."}
{"text":"Highly recommended!  Food was amazing!  Executive Chef Dave came out and visited our table which was an added bonus!  Check it out when you have time!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday during Summerlicious. I must say, even during Summerlicious, this restaurant is empty. I'm not sure if it's prior reviews, or if it's because no one knows about this place. My waiter, Alex, was the best! He was funny, and attentive to our table. He offered to take a picture for us. He also answered questions we had about the Blue Jays, even though they were not playing during our lunch.

There were a number of choices from the Summerlicious menu. I ordered the fish tacos to start. The fish tacos was good. It had a nice kick from the chipotle sauce. The fish was a good crispy (not too crispy but not soggy). For my main, I had the shrimp and chorizo pappardelle. I really enjoyed this! The portion was good for lunch. Also they had cucumber \"pasta\" interlaced with the pappardelle. I really enjoyed that since other places only serve the pasta and maybe some basil on the top. The sauce was nice and went well with the shrimp and chorizo. I also enjoyed that the pasta was fresh. For dessert I had creme brûlée. The top was a nice caramelized sugar. I really enjoyed the custard part. It was nice and creamy. The bottom had vanilla bean. Which then I could mix with the rest of the creme brûlée. So surprised at this find, and I went only because it was close to my work. Definitely a redo. Also a thanks to Alex for treating us so well during lunch. I'll definitely have to see how the service is during a game night. Alex said that there is a charge of $10 per person for a popular team (Boston, New York, etc.) and each person is required to spend $50. So that's $60 for the view with food."}
{"text":"A friend and I grabbed drinks here while waiting for the rest of our party. Normally I wouldn't write a review without having the full experience of what the restaurant has to offer, but the incredible views from here cannot be ignored. If you're a baseball fan, you definitely have to come to watch the game from this incredible view. Great service too, worth a try!"}
{"text":"I went there last year for dinner + baseball game. It was great! both the experience and the food. A home run ball hit my window scared the shit out of me, too bad I couldn't catch it :D. So I went back again with another friend, both of us love the food. It was absolutely delicious and the plates were heated to preserve the temperature of the food. 
The service was as good as their food, she was polite and professional. I will definitely go back again with friends!"}
{"text":"***While this hotel restaurant provides a rare view (a view of the interior of Rogers Centre; you can watch Blue Jays games from your table), their breakfast buffet is below average***

Arriba Restaurant is part of the Renaissance Hotel, which is attached to Rogers Centre.  Like Rogers Centre, Arriba Restaurant has the kind of modern design that probably felt much more modern years ago.  The best part of Arriba's design is how the glass windows provide diners a perfect view of the stadium; it is like being in a luxury box in the outfield.

For breakfast, Arriba Restaurant offers a breakfast buffet; a la carte breakfast options are also available.  Just seeing the names of the items featured in Arriba's breakfast buffet, it seems like a good deal.  They have several glass dispensers of cereal--both sugary cereals and healthy or at least non-sugary cereals.  For cold items, they have sliced fruit, whole fruit, yogurt, and deli meats.  They also have breakfast pastries, breads, muffins, bagels, English muffins, and a bread of the day like banana bread or zucchini bread.

In terms of their hot options, Arriba offers several items including bacon, sausage links, home fries, baked scrambled eggs, French toast, and oatmeal.  Arriba also has a chef station where you can customize an omelette or get eggs made to order.

While the variety is there at Arriba, the food was just not that good.  The bacon was not too bad though it could have been crispier and less salty.  The sausage links had horribly dry interiors.  The French toast was slightly dry and bland.  Some of the cereal options (like the Frosted Flakes) were a tad stale.

In terms of the positives, I liked their home fries.  Their banana bread was also good.  Their omelette station featured good ingredients like ham, tomatoes, mixed peppers, cheese, onions, mushrooms, and spinach.  The chef did a good job preparing the omelette.  Unfortunately, the egg was a poor quality as the omelette color was wrong; it almost looked liked egg whites.

Service was pleasant but a tad slow.

Prices are too high for the quality of the breakfast offered.

Arriba's breakfast buffet is below average for Marriott brand standards; the only Marriott brand breakfast buffet I would put below this one would be the Marriott I went to located in a rural area just outside of Downtown Madison, Wisconsin.  For Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members, the breakfast buffet is included with the room rate so it is not a bad option for elite members.  However, if breakfast is not included with your room rate at this hotel, I would strongly encourage venturing out of the hotel for a Downtown Toronto breakfast.

This is a difficult area to find parking.  The Renaissance offers valet parking for hotel guests; I am not sure if valet parking is also extended to non-hotel guests.  Their valet parking is expensive."}
{"text":"Arriba is a decent option for lunch. The food was fine but not in any way memorable. Great view of the field and excellent service, but otherwise overpriced. Selection of draft beers leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"I was there after my friend and I finished visiting CN tower at around 9:30 in the evening. It was in the Renaissance hotel. My friend and I just ordered two mains. The brown bread was more tasty than the white one. I ordered salmon for the main. It was not bad. The skin was crispy and it had quinoa and some veggie on the side. The lady who served us was very nice!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants for before a Jays game. This is because it's in the Renaissance hotel at the Rogers Centre and its windows overlook the field, offering a great view of batting practice while you eat and enjoy a few beers.

The downside of this restaurant is that it's a bit expensive, as you would expect from a hotel restaurant. The food is pretty good though. I went with something simple, a burger with cheese and bacon, and it was very well prepared. My expectations were low, but it was really succulent and the portion size was generous.

They have a decent beer list -- again you are paying a bit more per pint for the view, so always ask if there are any beer specials that night -- and the service is generally pretty good.

If it wasn't for the location and view, I could only give this 3 stars, but it's so much fun to watch BP and the starting pitcher warm up, that it gets a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff. Janice was really friendly and accommodated our group very well. The view on the field was great and made for a great night."}
{"text":"Ate here every day for breakfast for 12 days. If you're here during the week be sure to get Alex as your server. He was so good our group literally left him a trophy full of money. There is a daily hot special, in our case it was pot stickers most of the time. They have an omelette bar which is wonderful. I found they use a lot of oil which makes me feel sick so I had them make it without oil and it was perfect. The glasses here stay full of OJ and water. I never once had to ask. Service is really the key here. As for buffet weekday breakfasts go, it's slightly above your average because of the omelette bar but that's about it. This review is pretty much just for Alex.."}
{"text":"We booked about a month ahead of time to ensure our large group could reserve optimal seating with a view of the Jays game.  We were seated at two long tables and tended to by two servers.  It's a required minimum spend of $50 per person on game day and while we were hesitant that we could reach this, we ended up hitting the quota, with appetizers, drinks, desserts, 15% gratuity added on and taxes.  I general, there's a nice variety on the menu so it'll be sure to satisfy any tastebuds.  We were generally quite happy with our meal.  Appetizers are pretty generous portions and definitely shareable.  Our group covered pretty much every entree on the menu - steak, prime rib, fish and chips, flatbread, burger and mussels.  A few steaks were a bit more well done than ordered so they were returned and corrected.  Dessert was probably the standout; the bread pudding is highly recommended (croissant bits make for a surprising treat!).  Pop refills were frequently tended to.  Overall, we were quite happy with the experience here, pricier given the fare but appropriate given the dining + game atmosphere and location.  Service was also friendly and attentive.  Only complaint is that while our 15% gratuity was automatically added, they really should NOT have taxes the gratuity as well.  Makes no sense."}
{"text":"I woke up to breakfast at Arriba two consecutive mornings, but the experiences were like night and day.

The first time, service was very attentive, if not too attentive. A waiter poured my first cup of coffee, informed me about the breakfast offerings, and came to remove empty plates. However, many of the plates taken away were not done. Bye bye delicious omelet.

The second time, service barely existed. It was a chore to get coffee or the check. The omelet was not cooked as well, but still tasty. Good breakfast sausage, dry blueberry muffin, sweet pastries.

All in all, not bad for $12 a meal, with a view of the field at Rogers Centre."}
{"text":"Our server names Robert. He is a very attentive to our party of 10. We were impressed by the food quality, service and drinks. 

We came here on a Sat night and celebrated my friend's birthday. We had a good time even though it was busy dining hour. The server was able to attend our needs timely. Robert asked us if we were celebrating somebody birthday. We told him who it was then very sweet of the restaurant the chef wrote a birthday greeting on my friend's dessert plate.

Grilled sea bass and salmon both are great and juicy. The vegetable ragout ,flavour is perfectly spicy with enriched tomato sauce matching with couscous.   Excellent vegetarian item. 

NY steak and rack of lambs both are a little bit cold when all mains sent on our table. My friends commented that they could be a little more warmer but the meat are juicy and fresh. 

We also ordered some appetizers I recommend their scallops and nachos. The scallops are fresh and chewy. I think you cannot go wrong to dine here inside the hotel. Their quality and service are well presented and making guests satisfied and full. 

We gave extra tips even though the gratuity included in bill. The most important thing is that we enjoyed the most beside the blue jay baseball field in Toronto Roger Centre. 

The only comment we have , a signage of the restaurant . It seems missing in the lobby. hopefully it helps their customers and guests in the hotel."}
{"text":"First time and last time! Do not come here if you are hungry. We were a group of 9 with reservations at 7pm. From the moment we were seated service was SLOW. Took long for menus to come, drinks, and to take our order. At first we were enjoyimg ourselves and watching the game. We were there for the summerlicious menu and 2 of us ordered from the regular menu and got the game night prime rib special. We ordered appetizers which came within 20 mins. However the waitress was not attentive. She did not even refill our waters until asked. Although she asked the men if they wanted another beer and my friend if she wanted more wine. But our main courses did not come at 8, 8:30 nor at 9. We called for a manager to check on our food. A woman came by to give excuses with her apology. \"I am sorry but is this your first time here? It's summerlicious and a game night, we are always this slow. Sorry no one told you before you sat down. We have lots of groups tonight and I have to go apologize to all of them.\" When we told her how disappointing the service was she only offered to give a discount. After our complaint the manager brought us 2 free chips and dip which were stale. We were so hungry that we ate them anyway. I was 32 weeks pregnant and beyond really hungry. Our main courses came out starting at 9:20 with the last of our group being served at 9:30. Many of the group ordered steak which was over cooked not medium rare. One prime rib which was supposed to be medium rare came out medium well. The butter chicken dish was bland. We still ate it because we could not wait any more. No one asked if the food was cooked to our liking. They proceeded to avoid us. Even desserts were slow. At the end we were given our bills with a 20% discount but the gratuity was already added in. So we got really a 5% discount for our inconvenience. What really upset us was the insincere apology for terrible service. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is breakfast only. Misery. I didn't have a chance to try food. After being given a table by the host and then completely ignored for 5 min I left. Completely unacceptable for business place on a weekday!"}
{"text":"Had the lamb. Great dish. Wasn't surprised to the max, but it had a really good taste and texture. The chef did definitely put some heart into this portion. Super soft and perfectly cooked, made it a really nice experience to enjoy while watching the field throughout the big panorama windows."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times during Blue Jays game days and I had a great experience each time. 

The restaurant is located inside the Renaissance Hotel at the Rogers Centre. The decor inside the restaurant is fairly modern, the service efficient, and the atmosphere is pretty casual. I went with a few people so we made reservations and requested to sit next to the window so we could watch the game. Note: Seats near the window fill up quickly during game days so it would be wise to call ahead of time and reserve a table next to the window.

The type of food offered is typical pub fare food. They offer a decent amount of items on their breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus including several items that are good to share such as the chicken wings, nachos, quesadillas, and french fries. We ordered chicken wings and nachos which were all a good size to feed 4 people. The chicken wings were really good as well as the french fries (sweet potato fries option available) and the nachos were VERY cheesy and covered in toppings throughout the entire plate (chicken, cheddar & mozzarella, tomato, scallions, hot pepers!) - I was pleased to find that they had not been skimpy with the toppings.

For my main I ordered the crispy breaded fish sandwich (cabbage slaw & spicy mayo included in sandwich) and a side order of fries. The fish sandwich was delicious and the fries were fresh. The portion size was fairly large and cut in half so it's also good for sharing if you really aren't hungry. For dessert I had the creme brule cheesecake which was heavenly consisting of a smooth and rich cheesecake topped with a crackly sugary coating. Very good and a recommendation for those of you who are fans of both creme brulee and cheesecake! 

The service was wonderful. The staff friendly and I liked how they allowed us to serve each course slowly throughout the evening so we could stay and watch the game.

Overall, great experience and a very cool alternative way to watch the game while in the Rogers Centre. The food is pricey but you would probably spend just as much money on food inside the stadium in addition to paying for tickets. The atmosphere was pretty cool - not so loud but everyone in the restaurant was giving each other high fives and doing the wave every time something good happened. I would definitely return to this restaurant again during a game day!"}
{"text":"When I found Arriba tucked inside the Renaissance Hotel, I was initially annoyed that my quick Yelp search had led me to such a random location.  But I decided to eat here anyway because it was freezing cold outside and I was hungry.

The brunch was amazing!  There was a limited number of options on the menu, but the ones there sounded tasty and were varied.  All brunch options came with fruit salad and either hash browns or salad.  Our waitress was so friendly and accommodating, and she let me substitute salmon in the Eggs Benedict on the menu for spinach and tomato.  Everything was delicious!  Ingredients tasted fresh.  Good size portions that left you feeling full.

Seems like a particularly great place to go before/during/after games.  But even during the off season I'd highly recommend going for brunch!"}
{"text":"Solid place for a meal with a unique view. Came for breakfast/brunch on a Friday -- the restaurant was fairly empty. The stadium was being converted from the baseball field to an ice rink I think, which was interesting to watch. Our waiter was very attentive. The eggs benedict was excellent. Would go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Got in late to my hotel and needed a bite to eat after a long day. I sat at the bar, and being it my first time in Toronto, I was shocked to see a lit up baseball field behind me! I saw the poutine on the menu and figured I had to go for it, since I'd never had poutine before. Ordered the chicken sandwich and the soup (beef & barley) as my entree, considering I didn't know what to expect with the poutine. Everything was delicious!!! Soup tasted fresh and was a generous portion. The sandwich also tasted very fresh and the sauce it had was perfect. Now, the poutine was epic! The curds of cheese were amazing, the gravy was a smoked chicken gravy that isn't too heavy, but incredibly flavorful. Fresh cut fries. Wow. Very impressed! Great service, too. Had to come write this review! It'll be hard to stay away from the poutine on my next stay here."}
{"text":"I have visited here from Baltimore for many years and have found the food to be consistently good.  Whether you choose an entree or lighter fare, the quality of the food is outstanding.  The service from Whitney, Annie and Craig is always exceptional and they always make the experience even better.  I agree with the other review about the breakfast buffet being good, but don't overlook the menu items at breakfast either."}
{"text":"My boyfriend I stayed at the Renaissance Hotel during our stay in Toronto. We stayed in a room that overlooked the ball field (very cool!). We ate at Arriba a few times during our stay. The food here was great and the service was excellent. We were waited on by Whitney (at the bar) and Alex (in the dining room). We did not get the server's name at breakfast, but he was also very good. You must try the banana bread french toast if you're eating here for breakfast. The mushroom ravioli is an excellent choice for dinner. The only thing I recommend is lowering some of the drink prices (I though the juices prices were a little on the high end)."}
{"text":"Good food! I devoured my brunch (French toast) quickly and I would have wanted more.

The crème brûlée cheesecake was ok, not fantastic but it did not stop my friend and I from eating it.

Service is good and last but not least, the view over the stadium is neat"}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious Lunch during office hours.  The food was ok.  Nothing stood out as spectacular or memorable.  You can watch a game if one is playing while you're here.  It was surprisingly empty.  I guess it gets busy when there's activity at the Dome."}
{"text":"Came to watch the Blue Jays while visiting Toronto as my boyfriend is a big sports fan. Made a reservation for a window seat, which was confirmed, but when we arrived there was a long line to be seated and the hostess informed me that the window seats were all reserved. I was upset as that is not what was communicated in my previous confirmation from the restaurant, however the restaurant only holds tables for 30 minutes past the reservation time, and one party did not show, so we were moved to a window seat. Service was slow, but there was absolutely no rush and we stayed and watched the whole game. Food was edible (nothing great), but for the price and quality, I much preferred it to sitting in the stands and eating a hot dog.

We ordered an app, two entrees and had 4 rounds of drinks and it was $140 with tip. Definitely a great deal for dinner, drinks and a baseball game!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for the breakfast buffet and one for dinner.  Arriba is conveniently located in the Renaissance Hotel in the Rogers Centre.

Its the only place around here that has a breakfast buffet, and the only place in the city that has it for  less than $20.  At $16.95, its the best deal on the menu, and even includes a drink (coffee, tea, or juice regularly upto $4+).

Breakfast Buffet:  Its your standard fare of fruits (that's a pass for me ... give me some protein), cereal, breads, pastries, waffles, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, homefries, egg & omelet station.

Breads: selection of mini croissants and sliced bread (I usually skip the bread, but there is an industrial toatser) 
Pastries: mostly assorted danishes and muffins. Standard flavours and quality, blueberry, apple, cherry, cherry & cheese.  Quite fresh.
Waffles:  Belgian style.  Unfortunately they are all pre-made and served in a warmer.  This leads them to be soft instead of crunchy.  Still tasty though, and there is fruit compote, whipped cream, and maple syrup for them.
Scrambled eggs:  the name says it all.
Bacon: Not raw, but not crispy.  Its in a warmer, but its pretty good for warmer bacon.
Homefries:  Nice, semi crunchy potato seasoned potato cubes.  Good flavour, not too salty.  They add a fresh herb that i'm not used to and not really that into, but its not strong enough to stop my enjoyment.
Sausages: The star of the buffet. YUM YUM YUM. Typical breakfast sausage, perfectly cooked, not too salty.

Egg & Omelet station: Made to order eggs and omelets.  Good eggs and omelets if the cook is there.  I went one and didn't know they even had a station cuz i never say a guy there. I've never went there,  but friends have and said the omelet was good.

Buffet summary:  Good food, and lots of it. Less selection than some of the other buffets i have tried, but at half or one third the price, I'll take the basics any day. 

Dinner:
Bread and hummus:  free.  Slight garlic flavour.  Good if you like hummus.

Duck confit poutine:  A surprising large portion for the price tag ($9 or $10). A little light on the toppings. But good flavour.

Sea bass: expected a skinless boneless fillet, received bone in with skin.  chimichurri sauce tasted a bit  sour.

Arriba burger:  cheapest dinner option on the menu. thick and tasty. served with salad, soup or fries. would have gotten fries if we did not have the poutine.  Corn chowder was ok, looked more like mushroom soup though.

Dinner summary:  An OK dinner.  The cheap suff was better than the expensive stuff .... but the waitress did say that the grilled stuff was the best of the menu ... our fault for not listening ."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Arriba during winterlicious for dinner. I was very happy with my dinner, which started with a light salad of grilled mushrooms and beets. For main course, I had salmon, served with grilled veggies (not underdone like some 'fancy' restaurants) and potatoes. The sauce was a light lemony butter sauce. The salmon was grilled perfectly, and was very tasty. I can't complain about the dessert either, a mini apple crumble pie that was served warm with a scoop of delicious vanilla ice cream.

The restaurant is in the lobby of the Marriott attached to the SkyDome. Our table overlooked the baseball field (which was empty and seemed to be undergoing maintenance as it's February!). It would be really cool to have dinner here and get to see a bird's eye view of the baseball game.

Overall a great dinner and dining experience, but we were sad that we couldn't take the Path directly from the Marriott lobby to Union Station to avoid the Canadian winter!"}
{"text":"Had late lunch with the gf yesterday.  We ordered the chips with bacon maple dip, short rib sandwich w/ soup, smoked salmon sandwich w/ fries, 2 pop and a green tea. Everything including tips came out to $65. A little expensive for what you get. Service is ok and server was there when we needed her. Will be back"}
{"text":"It took a while to seat me,  like 15 minutes befause of a long-winded reservation on the phone. I requested a table next to the window but did not get it. 
I was here for three SUMMERLICIOUS menu and ordered the soup, the pork, and homemade fellowship gellato. The service is very slow,  but the Chef's Daily Soup Creation for SUMMERLICIOUS 2015 was excellent.4th 
The pork was juicy but somewhat chewy for a medium.  Potatoes a bit dry but asparagus grilled to perfection.
The local raspberry sorbet was very good.  The overall great food but slow service."}
{"text":"We were celebrating our anniversary and wanted to try something unique so we came here specifically because it has a great window view into the Rogers Centre. We came here on a game night, and it was an amazing experience. We're huge Jay's fans so getting a window seat was important to us. I made reservations well in advance to ensure we would get a window seat and we were accommodated.

The view was spectacular. We could even see the scoreboards and jumbotron. The only downside is you can't really hear what is going on inside the stadium except for when the crowd goes electric. But the restaurant turns on the radio broadcast of the game too so you can keep up with it. There are also TVs inside playing the game as well for the people who are not seated near the windows.

Service was good, we were taken to our seats right away and told the soup special and offered drinks. They had some local craft beer selections which is always nice. The food options were your standard bistro/bar options. 

For appetizers, we got the mussels and the beef bites. The mussels were standard and fresh. Nothing to write home about. The beef bites were tender and they came with crunchy shoestring fries. Both were only okay.

For mains, I got the game night special prime rib and my husband got the ribeye. The prime rib was meh, lacking in flavor. The ribeye was better though. Both came with mashed and veg. These were also only okay, but not too bad.

For dessert, we shared a crème brulee. This was really nice. Nice and creamy with a thick caramelized sugar crust. 

The manager was really nice and came to check up on us, he knew it was our anniversary so they offered us 2 glasses of champagne. How nice of them!

Note: There is a $50 minimum spend per person on game nights, which is a pretty good deal considering you get to watch the game for free while having dinner. 

Total for dinner for 2, including 3 beers was around $140. I think it's a good alternative than sitting inside of the Rogers Centre, especially if you want to watch the game but also enjoy a seated dinner."}
{"text":"Definitely don't go here for the food. Breakfast buffet is $24 pp so we opted for lunch. Had the roast beef in pretzel which wasn't fantastic. The service was great and Merle was very attentive!! Watched batting practice so that was a plus!!"}
{"text":"So I walked into the hotel, my eyes drew me to a tarp, and I walked towards it. I asked the woman who was standing in front of what appeared to be a bar if Arriba was nearby, she said yes, and I'm like um well where is it...and she goes here, and I'm looking back at her like right here? When I just got a blank state back I told her I was meeting some friends and she goes oh yeah they're in the back, and so I decided to replicate her blank stare. She tells me she'll show me. So, after our brief cat and mouse encounter, I found my friends but I already had a distate for the place, which wasn't improve by how chilly the place was.

We were here for winterlicious - I had the Caesar salad (which was pretty good for a Caesar salad), the steak, lime mousse (they ran out of raspberry), and ended with a hot chocolate in the spirit of keeping myseld warm. Everything was decent, not great but good enough and I'd say worth the price. 

After the  unpleasant encounter with the hostess, the waitress wasn't too bad, and the bonus was the view over the Skydome (I'm old school, can never call it the Rogers Centre). It was the off season and the lights were out so still not incredibly fascinating. So, overall, meh..."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great experience. The view of the field was amazing! The service was great. Janice was our server and she was both friendly and efficient. The prime rib was incredible. And the executive chef came to the table to greet us and see how everything was. Definitely would return and recommend!"}
{"text":"Grilled chicken club was a great lunch. Got the \"yam fries\" (I asked for \"no salt\", but they came salted anyway).

Good choice of beers in the small on-tap selection. Not a problem to find something good."}
{"text":"I was pleasently surprised after checking into the Rennaisance to find that they not only have an affordable breakfast option, but a great one at that!  Though the selection was somewhat limited, the food was really tasty and they had a fresh omlette station where the omlettes were made fast and with no gooey grossness.  Maybe its just me but it feels like every time I get an omlette its watery and not cooked all the way, but the guys here have the art of omletting down.  Great bet for a weekend brunch!

Oh! and for you football/baseball fans, Arriba has floor to ceiling views onto the Rogers Center field!"}
{"text":"The stadium was dark, but we needed a last-minute Summerlicious reservation between the Aquarium and CN tower, so this fit the bill. Underwhelming meal, unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is a review for their 2015 Summerlicious menu. I came with four other adults plus a toddler. The staff was very accommodating of the toddler regarding food and seating. However, the service was somewhat on the slower side when we first got there and only a couple of us had our drinks filled whereas the others' glasses were empty for awhile. Attentiveness could have been better.

The ambiance was okay. It's a restaurant inside a hotel. We went for an early lunch, so the breakfast buffet crowd and stations were still there. The food was good. I ordered crab cakes (a bit soggy), arctic char (flavourful), and strawberry sorbet (refreshing and sweet). The food was well-seasoned and the portion sizes were reasonable.

The cool thing about this restaurant is that it overlooks the Rogers Centre, but unfortunately, there were no games that day, so we didn't see anything. I probably wouldn't return just because it's not that conveniently located for me, unless I'm at a sports game or staying at the hotel, and it's not worth paying full price for the food served."}
{"text":"Located just inside the main entrance of the Renaissance Hotel by the Skydome, Arriba definitely gets the two thumbs up for the love and labour they put in their food. 

I brought my family here on New Year's Eve for brunch. We were hoping that the blinds were open so that we could enjoy the view of the Skydome's interior, but since Disney on Ice was happening, they weren't going to let non-paying customers get a free show!

For appetizers, we started with two plates of fried risotto balls, dressed lightly with a homemade tomato sauce and sprinkled with fresh sprouts. They came piping hot and were a pleasant surprise. Most of the appetizers are generously sized, so they can easily double as a light entree. 

My cousin ordered the duck confit poutine (see photo) which, other than it being a bit dry, she thought was superb. My grandmother went with the fish and chips and raved on and on about it. Since I am vegetarian, my choices were limited, but the pasta I had was al dente, not overly greasy and beautifully done with a white wine sauce. 

I'd had my exceptions low to begin with, knowing that this is a hotel restaurant that is forced to be open from 6:30 am until 1 am the next morning most days. However, it's rare to see my entire family be satisfied and happy with every single dish we get (they are notoriously critical of Western restaurants). 

Superb service and food that matches the price. Couldn't ask for more.

ACCESSIBILITY: It is located on the ground floor, so it is easily wheelchair accessible."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. I used a groupon and got a GREAT deal. (I also got a 15 dollar off promo on groupon) so I got a regular 100 dollar dinner for 34 (plus tax and tip). Received two apps, two mains, and a shared dessert. The steamed mussels were fabulous and the portion was pretty generous. If I was eating there again on a regular day I would consider just getting that as my meal and calling it a day. For my main, I got the steak. The size, the temperature, the red wine demi glace, was all perfect. I also tried some of my partners pork chop and it was excellent, ESPECIALLY the apple cider gastrique. We shared a bread pudding and it was yummy but small, though that's all I had room for. The bread puddings are muffin size as they are made in a muffin tin.  Although it was good, I wouldn't want to pay the regular 9 dollars for it myself. In the end, the food was great."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto I wanted to pick a restaurant that my boyfriend would enjoy for his birthday trip. I chose Arriba due to the view/proximity of the Rogers Centre. Unfortunately thanks to a one direction concert happening the following night, the windows were closed. The food was great. We had the muscles as an appetizer and they were the best I've had. I had a salad with quinoa, the name is slipping my mind, and it was delicious. I cannot have gluten and when I told the server this I was met with care about my food and dietary restrictions rather than the usual attitude or ignorance about it. They made sure the muscles stayed away from contamination and pan fried the chicken for my salad rather than putting it on the grill. I didn't even have to ask, the just knew the restrictions. My boyfriend had the 7oz steak. They cooked it to a perfect medium rare and it came with fries that he loved. Our waiter was so kind and attentive enough without hovering. They also had a live singer in the beginning of our meal and I was obsessed with how good she was. 

Overall it was great food, good ambience. Just wish we could've seen into the stadium."}
{"text":"A great view field view contrasted by an unexemplary brunch, average food, and inconsistent service (solid waitstaff, MIA hostess). Far better brunch options in city than this, within walking distance to hotel."}
{"text":"Great food and a very sympathic waitress made the experience a great moment. 
The view on the Roger center is really a plus. I want to come back when a game is running. 
Surprisingly the prices were really decent. 
I really recommend."}
{"text":"We went to the Arriba restaurant since it was one of the few restaurants open on Christmas Eve (we were attending midnight mass nearby).  It was a surprising good restaurant located in the Marriott Renaissance hotel.  The portions were plentiful and reasonably priced, and the waiter was very helpful in guiding our wine and food selections.  Though the restaurant was only open until 10 p.m., he did not rush us; instead, he encouraged us to get dessert and coffee.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Worst meal ever. Burgers can only be served \"well done for health reasons.\" I suspect these are cooked and reheated because the burger we ordered was beyond dry. The stir fried soba was pathetically soggy and unbearably sweet. Soba is usually firm - even the ones served with soup. This restaurant boils and then stir fries the soba noodle with vegetables in an unbearably sweet sauce. It is like sweet and sour soba. I thought they would boil the soba then place the stir fry on top of it. Kinda like putting the sauce on the spaghetti but not sautéing the spaghetti with the sauce. Don't be deceived by the 4 star rating of this place. It is really the worst."}
{"text":"I believe this restaurant is definitely a hidden gem amidst the slew of restos clustered in the downtown core. Located inside the Renaissance Hotel which is attached to the Roger's Centre / Skydome it boasts a spectacular birds eye view of the entire field down below! The whole entire left side of the restaurant is lined with floor to ceiling windows with tables bordering it which are prime locations to watch the game.

Yes that's right! You can have a lovely meal and watch Blue Jays Game down below for FREE! I suggest making a reservation to ensure you get a table right beside window. The restaurant itself is very airy feeling with white tables and walls and comfy colorful retro chairs. When the game starts the waiters turn the TV's on to the game and broadcast it throughout the restaurant.

For Starters

House Made Chips & Dip w/Bacon & Caramelized Onion Dip
Chips came perfectly golden, crispy and warm. The thick and creamy dip with real bits of bacon and sweet caramelized onions was the perfect pairing! 

For mains we both decided to get burgers. I chose the Spicy Arriba Burger and boy did it pack some heat! I would have to say it's definitely one of the best burgers the city has to offer!

Toppings - Spicy Arriba Burger - Hot Pickled Peppers, Jalapeno Monteray Jack Cheese, Spicy Sambal Mayo

Meat - Perfectly cooked and seasoned Thick 'AAA' Certified Angus Beef Patty 

Bun - Nicely Toasted \"Ace Bakery\" Poppy Seed Egg Bun was flavorful and held up well against the patty

Sweet Potato Fries - Huge portion perfectly crisp outside and soft inside

Arriba Triple Play Burger - Crispy Bacon, Smoked Back Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Bacon & Caramelized Onion Spread

Finally for Dessert 

Warm Chocolate Brownie w/ Vanilla Ice Cream, Berry Compote, Crushed Pistachio
The brownie is homemade and came out freshly baked from the oven! Warm and fudgey center with there sweet homemade vanilla bean ice cream and the contrast with the slight tanginess from berry compote and the crunch from the pistachios was definitely a home run!

Overall a spectacular meal, great service and fantastic view of the Jay's game, I definitely recommend you experience this at least once in your lifetime and try the burgers!"}
