{"text":"This restaurant has always been my goto place whenever I'm in the hood, either for a quick bite or simply to satisfy my guilty pleasures.

Thus far, there are 3 items that always make it out the door with me--Lumpia Shanghai, Chicharong Bituka and Turon.

Lumpia Shanghai is mini deep fried spring rolls, filled with mainly pork and shredded carrots.  5 for $1.85, its compliments really well with their sweet and sour sauce.  The best thing about it you can have over 10 pieces and don't feel oily/stuffed.

Chicharong Bituka, something that might scare a lot of people away.  Traditional deep fried pork intestine ($6/100grams), it is THE SNACK to go with a nice cold glass of beer.  It's got somewhat an acquired burnt taste but delicious in my opinion.

Last but not least Turon, a deep fried (yes, that's a lot of fried food!) plantain spring roll.  Its got a small piece of Jackfruit stuffed in it as well.  Crispy skin, semi firm plantain and then a light, sweet coating of caramelized sugar, YUMMY!  These go for $1.50/piece.

Overall, a very clean cafeteria style restaurant, with lots of great food, just the way a Filipino mom would make it--very homey!  They are also known best for their catering."}
{"text":"Slightly expensive combo  $7.99 plus tax for 1 rice  and 2 meat or vegetable. Flavor is good. Place looks clean. Combo portion are small (meat wise). Their cutlery/napkin section is beside their garbage can. Eeww!!! Will I come back, I dont think so. We spent $20 plus for 2 combo and 1 extra rice. Carribean Queen  gives you more bang for buck. And they dont accept debit card."}
{"text":"I've been going here since they opened.  Good quality Filipino food.  It is pricey.  But that's expected for the quality.  Worth it.

Fresh food, very consistent with flavour and quality compared to other Filipino restaurants I've been to.  This is my go to for catering.

Impressed with their service.  Keep up the good work!

Highly recommend:

* sweet and sour fish
* lumpia
* pork bbq
* bopis"}
{"text":"Went there during my lunch break, with co-workers who were non-filipinos. They were so excited to try the food. I called ahead to make sure they had garlic rice and told them we will be ordering 5 breakfast combos in the next hour or two. The person on the phone said it was fine, just come in. We got there before the lunch rush, but ended up waiting 40 MINUTES for our food because the longganisa & tocino were not ready. They could have said something when we got there so we would have known the wait time and opt for other food.
The guy proceeds to tell me I should have called..... I told him..... I DID!!!! Clearly they need to improve communication between staff and to communicate to customers if something is not available.

Such a waste of time!!!! And bad first impression on my co-workers. Such an avoidable circumstance."}
{"text":"When I'm craving for quality Filipino food, I'd always go to Remely's.   Here are my thoughts about Remely's:

The Restaurant facility - its clean, brightly lit, well taken cared-of and the ambiance is inviting. Its not a fine dining restaurant but its more of the usual diner/cafeteria format you'd find in a Filipino food outlet. 

The Staff - wears proper restaurant attire so you'll know that they practice safe food handling. 

The Service - I would say its average to good as this is more of a diner. 

The Food - This is one the best Filipino restaurant/diner in Toronto.  I recommend you try their Pancit Malabon which is a noodle dish normally served in Manila during festivities, birthday's, and other special occasions.  Other favorite of mine are the Turon (friend banana roll)and Halo-Halo, just to name a few. Their Okoy (shrimp patties) on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired.

The Price - its reasonable for the quality (and quantity)."}
{"text":"clean, consistent service, flavor is pretty good 
would recommend"}
{"text":"Best Turon in Toronto
Philippine snack made of thinly sliced bananas and a slice of jack fruit, dusted with brown sugar, rolled in a spring roll wrapper and fried. 
They serve authentic Filipino Cuisines with high standards of quality and freshness. we tried their Turon and Halo-Halo and other foods and enjoyed them. When we have our relatives visiting us from Montreal, the first place they want to go is Remely's Restaurant and try their Turon. It is very well cooked and it is crispy.
This \"Family Day\" weekend holiday, visit the restaurant and enjoy the taste of Philippine."}
{"text":"This is usually my go to for  Filipino food but my biggest problem with this place is that the food always comes barely warm. I think they might be serving food made the day before and they use the warmers to warm the food up. That or their warmers are not as hot as they should be which is a huge problem if the food is sitting there all day."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4.5*... Took relatives visiting from Michigan for Filipino food, this place is amazing with all the different variety of main dishes available, along with pancit and rice. We each got a 2 item combo and a piece of lechon kawali and whole bangus to share... It was way too much food, but it's the Holidays right?!  Of course you can make comparisons between your Lola's adobo or your Tito's kare-kare, but the food was definitely Filipino in taste, and I mean come on, I would have to spend 2-3 days cooking if I wanted to eat all those dishes. Couldn't also resist having a turon and halo halo for dessert! Thanks so much, now I'm gonna take a nap"}
{"text":"This is another filipino restaurant in scarborough, toronto. 
Nice place but service is not bad and not that good. 
Ive been here twice and server ignored me and i have to ask twice before they serve. 

Some days restaurant is full and the more its full the more service is not good. 

This is my opinion and my experience. 
Thank you"}
{"text":"MSG central... need I say more?  Plus the guy who runs the store irritates me... what's his name?  Riiight, Vince.

I do like their Okoy and Palabok."}
{"text":"Haven't come here for a few years since moving a bit further. Place got renovated and looks really nice in comparison to pre-renovation. Only stopped by to get some turon but I've never been disappointed. Good food in general. Service kind of waivers."}
{"text":"This store is lucky I'm giving them a star. 
Their customer service is terrible and their workers pretend they're trying to help but the truth is they try to act stupid and say they're trying to get the entire story correct and just keep you on the phone giving you the run around. Irene provided terrible customer service!!

I called to get a quote on ordering a whole Sans Rival cake and the person told me she would have to confirm if she could order it for me since their supplier (Goldilocks) hasn't supplied for them in awhile. The same person called me and left me a voicemail to confirm they were able to order the Goldilocks Sans Rival cake for me. 

Once my order was picked up and delivered to the party, the cake was absolutely NOTHING Remely's promised me. It was a tiny cake and DEFINITELY NOT Goldilocks!!! 

Irene gave me the run around when I complained and kept putting me on hold. She kept telling me that she was writing all the information to tell the manager and kept interrupting every time I was telling my side of the story. I finally told her that I'll just call back and speak to the manager myself! I asked the for the managers name and she said it was Vince and that he'll be in the store on Tues between 5-7. We'll see what happens when I call."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in Scarborough, just a few blocks north of Scarborough Town Centre/401 highway exit and easily accessible by TTC or by car. There are plenty of parking spots available in the plaza that Remely's is located but during the weekend especially at noon I found it difficult to find a good parking spot.

If you're looking for authentic Filipino food Remely's is definitely the place to go. Once known as a popular Filipino bakery offering only takeout & catering options, Remely's has switched gears and is now a full on Filipino eat-in restaurant serving traditional dishes such as palabok, beef tapa, sinigang, and diniguan.

The restaurant has a fair amount of tables available, for parties of 2 to larger parties of 6 - with intimate booths or long tables (seat yourself). During the weekend rush (lunch time) it can get a little packed so you may have to wait for a seat. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed - a good place for friends and family to hang out and enjoy a meal.

My experience when ordering the food was a little disorganized and slow. Their menu board lists the food they have available (although I found it difficult to read) but it does not list prices or what kind of combos they offer so you are left sort of humming and hawing until it's your turn to order. I think this is what causes the slow service and chaos of ordering your meal because you have to ask the employee questions about the menu you wish you could have just easily referred to on their menu board.

Prices of their meals are standard for takeout eateries: 2 items + rice = approximately $8.00 - a price you would easily spend at a food court in the mall. That day I ordered lumpia shanghai & pancit palabok. Lumpia is a Filipino spring roll consisting of ground pork, onion, carrots, and ground shrimp also served with a sweet and sour sauce. These deep fried goodies have always been a favourite of mine and they definitely hit the flavour spot at the restaurant, replicating the Filipino appetizer that I have known to love my entire life.

Pancit Palabok is a dish that consists of fried rice noodles, crushed pork rinds, minced green onion, and hard boiled egg. It is primarily flavoured with soy sauce and patis (fish sauce). This is also one of the childhood favourite meals that I sometimes crave and I was quite pleased with the authenticity of the meal as well as the fact that it was delicious.

The restaurant also offers popular Filipino desserts such as ube (purple yam cake), polvorone (short bread cookies), ensaymada (Filipino brioche coated with butter, sugar, and shredded cheese), leche flan (creme caramel), and pandesal (sweet bread). These desserts are already prepackaged and ready to take out and appear to have been made by separate company operating in Scarborough. I picked up a few boxes of assorted polvorone at $5 per box which I think it is a pretty good deal. The polvorone was a perfect light dessert snack although much sweeter than your average short bread cookie.

Overall, I give this restaurant a 3.5 stars. The food was delicious & fresh and also very authentic. The prices were reasonable and the service was friendly, although slow. If they change their menu board to reflect their meal prices and combo variations it may resolve the disorganization and long wait time that I experienced when ordering food. Everything other than that was great."}
{"text":"Filipino food is pretty hard to come by in toronto and the gta, so finding this place was quite the delight! Unfortunately (fortunately for the optimists?) the food was really hit or miss here. I went here with coworkers for lunch and we ordered a bunch of different things off the menu.

The chicken adobo wasn't very flavourful, nor the pusit relleno, and the palabok was pretty average. But the kare kare was so soft, and the halo halo was to die for. They really didn't skimp on the ingredients with the halo halo, there were chunks of flan and coconut jelly in it.

The price for the drinks and desserts were a bit high for a take out place, (the halo halo was around $5.50, the rest of the desserts being $4-6) but the meals were pretty cheap, and the serving sizes for the meals were very generous.

The restaurant interior was very nicely decorated though. It was new, clean, and homey and really added to the dining experience and made the visit more enjoyable."}
{"text":"My family and I catered from Remely's for a family gathering of about 30 people and it was a huge success.

We ordered the following:
medium lumpia shanghai $30
medium lechon kawali $60
medium palabok $35
small chop suey veggies $20
small pinakbet w/ gata $25
small dinuguan $25
rellenong bangus $22
25 ukoys $37.50 -- highly recommend
18\"kakanin platter $46
whole sans rival $35
Total: $300+

See menu offerings: http://www.remelys.com/menu.htm

Price: Affordable.

Portions: Family-style. Plenty to last you leftovers for the next couple days.

Remely's is probably the nicest and cleanest Filipino restaurant I have been to thus far. Their space isn't huge, but it has about 10 tables with ample amount of seating to accommodate their sit-in patrons. You can bet there will be a line during lunch time. I found Remely's to be the best tasting and my favorite Filipino restaurant in the Toronto area so far. They also offer a vast menu as well as baked goods and pastries. 

The only item we didn't care for was the sans rival. The wafers were stale and the butter cream was extremely sweet. It was probably not made that day and stored in the freezer for awhile. I would recommend the turon or halo-halo instead.

Service: Accommodating, friendly, and fast. I was really pleased with how they handled the catering and my family agreed that the food from Remely's was delicious and the best they've tried thus far.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Filipino extravaganza!  Although Remely's is best known in Pinoy circles for their catering (amazing party trays galore) and bakery, Remely's is a great place to stop in and have lunch or dinner - or a quick take-out if you prefer. Warm and homey decor, friendly servers, (usually) plentiful selection - I love dropping in for some tasty, homestyle adobo, lumpia, caldereta, sweet BBQ skewers, or palabok. Then, yes, some turon for dessert!  Salamat po! (Keep in mind, it's 'cafeteria-style' service.) Adding pics to show you what it's all about!"}
{"text":"This is THE Filipino restaurant to go to when in Scarborough. They've got all the good ol' Filipino comfort foods, guilty pleasures and everything in between, just the way mama makes it. Remely's runs cafeteria style if you're eating in (pick and choose what you want, while sliding your tray gradually toward the register), but they're also well known for their catering. 
Combos (rice + selection of sides) run approx. $10 depending on the sides you get. My personal favourites? The kare kare & the paksiw na lechon, SO good! I also never leave without getting turon for dessert. In the summer? A halo halo :)"}
{"text":"Food SUCKS! You know why, because they microwave your food!!! Who does that???? I have never in my life whereas I Ordered food and infront of me was a big MICROWAVE, like what?? I was like did they just microwave my food?? Really? 

The food was too pricey for microwave re heat food!!! Who knows long that food been there!!!!!  When I ate the food, it wasn't even good!!!! I was so pissed off because it was too pricey!!!! Whoever said this resto is, I a LIAR!!!!! I am never, ever coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Toronto... This is the best place to grab a flip food...

Halo halo and Taho is awesome...
The pork bbq is great"}
{"text":"I guess I'm sort of biased since every kid thinks their mom's cooking is and will always be the best. But when no one feels like cooking, this is a pretty good place to get some Filipino food, stat.

The menu will vary, but will always have some staples, like steamed white rice, siningag (fried with garlic) if you're lucky, BBQ pork skewers, lumpiang Shanghai (fried spring rolls), dinuguan (blood pudding) with puto (steamed rice cake), fried fish, pancit bihon (thin rice noodles), and my personal favorites, lechon kawali (crispy pork belly) and palabok (seafood and rice noodles). They also have snacks, like chicharon (pork rinds), and dessert, like Brazo de Mercedes (jelly roll with meringue outside and custard inside) and turon (sweet banana spring roll, usually with jackfruit). They even sell Sarsi, the Filipino sasaparilla soft drink, kind of like root beer.

There's usually quite the selection of food from different parts of the Philippines. If you're unsure of what things are, you can ask, but my suggestion would be to just try a little bit of everything that appeals to you or that you're curious about. Chances are you'll enjoy it! You can eat in or take out, and I believe they also cater.

The food is hot, portions are fair, and service is quick and friendly. Quality is pretty good, but not the absolute best, depending on what time you go and how long the food's been sitting out for. I suppose it's more of like a take-out/homemade fast food type of place, nothing fancy. Regardless, it's somehow comforting to know that even though my mom's not making the food, it's likely that someone else's mom is, right at the back of the restaurant, and that it's not some pre-packaged frozen junk from a factory."}
{"text":"Ordered filipino style spaghetti (sauce is sweet compared to the italian version). It had alot of sauce(almost watery) but I wish they`ve added grated cheese on top and more hotdog. Pasta is cooked perfectly. Tasted better the next day as the pasta had already soaked in most of the sauce.
Small tray is $25 which serves 10-13. Med is $45 so there is quite a difference in pricing.

Their lumpiang shanghai really stood out for me. For a 100 pcs, it was for only $30. This takes alot of time and effort to make so it is very well worth it. 
If I were to buy the ingredients, it would probably cost me $15-$20 anyways. Paying for labor means my manicure`s saved for another week. 
Not too salty, crispy egg wrap and not burnt on the inside. This tends to happen alot as some I know mix too much soy sauce with the pork which causes the meat to cook faster than the wrap.

Their Halo Halo is also very good. I prefer theirs to Max`s of Manila. It is served in a bubble tea like container with a straw and a spoon. Perfect in the summer. I haven`t tasted most of their entrees, but this will be my go-to resto for future party trays.


The place is clean and well-kept and gets very busy during lunch and Sundays. They are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"I would give them a 5/5 for catering alone. I've been to tons of Filipino parties where Remely's prepared and served food. Their table is beautifully arranged and the catering staff are always happy to feed and concerned with presentation.

The restaurant itself gets less than 5. At first impression, its definitely cleaner than any other Filipino restaurant in Scarborough. However the food is a dollar or two overpriced for what us patrons know it's worth, since we aren't paying for service... you order at the counter and carry your food to a table, grabbing utensils and complimentary water from a pitcher along the way. With that said, you aren't seated. You seat yourself. And if the restaurant is full but you manage to find a table, its chairs could be hogged by a family at another table. Moreover, you carry your own unclean dishes to the garbage receptacle.

Another reviewer mentioned the microwave that's shamelessly on full display for the whole world to see. I personally don't mind my food re-heated as long as it's clearly cooked relatively recently and the taste reflects that. But of all last experiences, my food was not microwaved but I could admit I'd rather my food was much hotter.

Service is so-so. It's quick, but not outstanding enough to compliment.

I know the food is absolutely better than average because I could eat the same Filipino dishes at home but still want to eat here! The BBQ sticks and the kare kare are my favourites on the menu. The halo halo is a great dessert option. However, again, for the price asked, you don't get enough rice or entree. You get a ball of rice that you can only try to ration and the food to eat it with comes in a tiny bowl. As a petite person, I get by. But if I were a person of larger stature I could imagine I'd still be hungry. All in all, Remely's kills it for catering, but quite a bit could be done to step up the restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Remely's is a family-run business and here you will find lots of authentic filipino dishes. They have a dining section which is basic but clean. They also do catering. Staff is friendly and will take time to explain to you the dishes and ingredients used in making it. Two thumbs up for Remely's!"}
{"text":"I am not really fond of sweet sweet dessert or cake...  And today one of my coworker got this Filipino Purple Yam cake ($12.99) from Remely's for someone's birthday. 

The cake is so so so purple!!! And one bite I am in love!! I love yam.. yam dessert, yam icecream.. The cake has such a rich yummy yammy taste and full of flavour! So tropical tasting!!

The cake part of the cake has so much texture... but not heavy... oh so heavenly!

And there are fresh fruits on top!  and the price so reasonable!

Sorry I should have took the photos before we eat the cake! I never imagine how good it tastes!

YES I want one of those for my birthday too!!"}
{"text":"my favorite goto restaurant second to my mom's cooking. Great for takeout. their seating is too cramped."}
{"text":"I got take out a few times; lumpia (spring rolls) is delicious crispy and generous amount of stuffing inside. 
I will definitely return to try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"I'm not a Filipino food gourmet, but the items I've had here are pretty good.  Many folks seem to order take-out and just come in long enough to pick it up.  The BBQ pork on the skewers is the best thing I've had there--meaty and moist.  Minus a star or two for overall cleanliness--just a feeling of grime, neglected washroom, cluttered hallway, etc.  Its popular with the target clientele.  It seems everyone in the summer orders Halo Halo, but I just can't find the attraction in a dessert with purple ice cream, various sweet things, and beans."}
