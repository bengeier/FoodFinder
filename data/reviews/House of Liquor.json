{"text":"Under new management, I suppose, and is now called House of Liquor. Well, the new owner is great! Very friendly and accommodating! The store's clean too! The best part of this place is they have Mediterranean food selections, which I'm really excited about. Mediterranean food is one of my favorites!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! We've been going here since the transition from the old to the new owners. They have an  amazing selection and will gladly order something for you. And the food... don't get me started on the food. It is amazing!!! Some of the best Greek food I've ever had. Their prices are very reasonable and the lunch specials come with a ton of food. They are incredibly friendly and generous and truly love their customers."}
{"text":"So glad this place is nearby!! The guys that run this place are super friendly and they make awesome food from scratch. Awesome one-stop-shop!"}
{"text":"Delicious falafel wrap and amazing homemade hummus! The people who work here are very friendly every time I go in. Highly recommend this place for great Mediterranean food that's homemade and good for you :)"}
{"text":"I found the food to be disgusting...and I eat almost anything. There's a reason that their parking lot is almost always empty."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 gyro combos. The food did not taste good at all. Also, our sodas tasted like seltzer water, just nasty. On the plus side uber eats was quick delivering."}
{"text":"the food here is so good! its become my family's new favorite! Everyone who works here is always very friendly and helpful! The selection of beer and wine is great as well!"}
{"text":"We've never been in here before. My husband stopped in to grab a quick six pack of Bud Light Lime, and upon opening two bottles, both of us knew something wasn't right with the beer. We checked the date on the box and they had expired in MARCH. It's almost November. Really? They tasted foul. For a House of Liquor, this place needs to make sure the \"liquor\" is fresh."}
{"text":"The food at this place is bomb! Had a gyro. The meat was seasoned perfectly and toppings delicious. Great value! So fast! Service is top notch. Tons of liquor, beer, and wine to go with your food. The liquor selection has big and airplane size bottles. So many snack foods too! You get in and out faster than grocery store. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Finally closed!!! Should have been closed down long ago. Second owner was extremely rude!! I knew it was just a matter of time. Can't believe it took this long to go out of business. Good riddance"}
{"text":"Beer, liquor, chips, and one of the best Mediterranean take out restaurants in town?  It surprised me too, but I've been back twice in two days now.  Ask what's the best thing they have that day because it may not be on the menu and it'll probably be amazing.  If you like having your food put together by really nice men who take pride in what they make for you, I highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come there all the time. I always deal with the owner there and he is the best. He's always so nice and helps me find exactly what I need. If I ever don't find what I want he orders it and it's there within days. I absolutely love this place. Never came when it was owed by the previous people when I went there it was always empty the shelves would be so plain with maybe one of a particular thing never was stalked. Now I go there anytime I need something quick. Thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"I would have posted a picture but it's pretty much demolished at this point. First off the customer service is absolutely amazing. The owner is super friendly which started the experience off well! Secondly the falafel was so amazing I didn't want to stop eating it! Lastly you can't beat the price of this place we got a falafel plate and a veggie plate for 20$ and still have food left over for a whole other meal! Definitely going back again!!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken gyro and it was just ok. The grape leaves and hummus were very good sadly the pita was hard as a rock. But what I will continue to go back for is the tabouli! I have never found one I liked and this place was amazing"}
{"text":"Stopped to check this place out and it was closed at 11:00 AM on a Saturday. Sadly I don't think this business will make it."}
{"text":"This place has defiantly become a favorite in my home. I work at the spa next door and come here for lunch almost everyday. They are so kind and caring. Plus the food is incredible! Always something new and always something delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean dishes!!!! Naji hooks it up with great  chicken shawarma Gyros, salads and HOMEMADE BAKLAVA!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber Eats. I am a vegetarian so I ordered the Vegetarian Platter... wow! SO delicious! some of the tastiest tabbouleh I've ever had... hummus was phenomenal.. grape leave were perfect... everything was just SO good!  I definitely recommend to anyone.. food was absolutely delicious.  Also very fast. My food was delivered in about 20 minutes. Can't beat that after a long day of work!  Thanks House of Liquor!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   Very clean the two guys that run this place or always warm and welcoming always willing to spark up a convo! They have the best selection of Mexican candies!!   And they also of a lot of bottles that other places do not have like wild turkey etc.   Idk why lees discount liquor opened up because this place has killer prices!!  Also killer Greek food!   The baklava is bomb and they also sell a ton of diff specialty cigars! As well as some Tobacco pipes and small bubblers!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!  Fantastic customer service.  The food is marvelous.  So healthy and delicious.  We have eaten here twice in the past week and have tried something different each time.  We are unfamiliar with Mediterranean food but will definitely become regulars here.  You will not be disappointed.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"The food is off the chain...handmade and delish.  Ppl at location were nice and knowledgeable. May seem like a small convenience store on the outside but AWESOME authentic health Greek food inside as well. HIGHLY recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly people, good customer service and yummy food. We got some chicken plate and some Shawarma panini and even though it was a lot of food I still got some Dolmas because I couldn't resist it, the place looked clean and the owner was super nice. I will definitely stop by more often for lunch.  Note: it's a liquor store that serves food also, but there is a separate section for food and they're rated A from the health department."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot to grab lunch or dinner.  Great fresh Mediterranean food and friendly service.  The Gyro Pizza was wonderful, the Falafel fresh and amazing.  Definitely a recommend!!"}
{"text":"Amazing falafel plate, and their lentil soup is so delicious I could eat it everyday. One of the better falafel plates I've had in town. I ordered from Uber eats and it was delivered in under 30min. BOOM! new go to joint!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered gyro plate for take out and the meat was so overcooked it was hard and dry like a cracker. Pita bread was plain, uninspiring and sort of stale. I had high hopes after reading all of the positive reviews."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! I'll be back a few times a week for sure! Garlic sauce is a must try!!"}
{"text":"I'm usually hard to impress when it comes to Mediterranean food, especially if it's Lebanese food. This is by far the best Lebanese food I've had in Las Vegas, and I say that not only as a foodie but also as a Brazilian who has eaten her body weight in tabbouleh (and let me tell you, in Brazil there's Lebanese food everywhere)!  What I love best other than the food is that the owners are incredibly kind and helpful. I've been twice so far and they remembered me right away.  You can tell they love doing what they do and the market itself has an air of familiarity I wouldn't have expected.  I've gotten the chicken plate with rice, hummus, and tabbouleh which was phenomenal. You can taste the freshness of the food in every bite; it literally tastes healthy and amazing at the same time. My fiance got the gyro and it was gone in seconds! That tells you right there how much he didn't like it.  My second time going to House of Liquor, I got the vegetarian combo and a side of kibbeh. Not only was the food oh so pretty but it tasted delicious and I had enough for lunch the next day.  I'll definitely be coming back regularly."}
