{"text":"Ehhhhh.... This place is okay. It's clean, the server was sweet, the food is decent. It's definitely better than Don Tequila or El Rodeo, but I love El Se√±or in Painesville for my authentic Mexican.   We had chilaquiles (soggy), tamales (unmemorable), tacos (the pastor was tasty). The green sauce on the chilaquiles, red sauce on the tamales and the salsa for the table was all tasty. I'd go again if invited and be happy, but I won't make the Thierry minute drive to come back on my own.  The food is definitely quality, just not the best I've had.  .....oh, and the tv was way too loud. Sit far away from it!"}
{"text":"I do love the food. I don't love the service.    Mexican culture is known to be a hospitable culture, and I'm just not feeling great hospitality here.   I have been here twice, and will probably go again since it is one of the only Mexican restaurants in the Cleveland area that serves real tacos, and aguas frescas (i.e. horchata, jamaica).  But I just wish that my next server doesn't make me feel like I'm bothering her when I ask for a refill.    Also a big plus, they don't use lard."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch as we were looking for something easy and I was craving some tacos.  The location is close to where we live - OH City- and it was fairly easy to find the brightly colored sign.  Upon entering the restaurant I was surprised how large the main room was and the art work/ music were both pretty bold. Our server wasn't the best, friendly but dissinterested. I got the steak taco dinner & my girlfriend got the chorizo taco dinner.   Both were tasty; her chorizo had good spice.  We also ordered a cheese quesadilla which was tiny but for only $2 we should have realized that it would be that way. The complimentary chips & salsa were ok as the chips were very good but the salsa was bland. Overall, we will be back because I love having an inexpensive & good taco joint nearby!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin!!!!! The chips were stale, the rice was dry, the shredded chicken was dry like shredded paper, the beans taste like they came out of a can...... The quality of their food had gone down tremendously since they opened........ If they keep serving up food like this they won't be in business long........."}
{"text":"Everything we tried was fresh and delicious. Shrimp ceviche! Chile rellenos! GOOD, good refried beans! I'm going back for the best tamales this side of Chicago!  The owners are friendly and proud of what they serve. This place is brand new, and needs YOUR support!! Get there!!!!"}
{"text":"From looking at former reviews and pictures of the menu I thought this would be a good place. Very disappointed to get mediocre Mexican food for $15. There are much better places for Mexican including Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This is the real deal! I haven't had this good of food since I was in Mexico.  All made fresh and very well done. Fresh made sauces. This is my new favorite place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Unless you want hair in your food and be verbally insulted by the waiter,  go eat there! I have never experienced such humiliation and racial  discrimination..... the waiter tells me  \" I always have problems with you people,  you Africans.\" SPEECHLESS!"}
{"text":"Real deal mexican.  I used to live in Mexico and this is one of the best in Cleveland.  Favorite part is the habenero salsa that changes each day.  I'm a simple man,  tacos al pastor. Had chivo or goat last night that was great."}
{"text":"We have been trying to find a good cheap Mexican restaurant in Cleveland for so long. I think our goal was finally achieved.  When we walked in, we were instantly greeted and seated. They started us off with a basket of chips and salsa. The chips were pretty good, but unfortunately the salsa wasn't anything special (I didn't like it).  We started with a quesadilla. It was a 6 (or maybe 8) inch flour tortilla folded in half with melted white cheese.  I was a little surprised at how small it was, but guess shouldn't have expected too much since it was only $1.50. Anyway, it was okay. I have made better at home.  Then we each ordered the 2 taco dinner plates (comes with beans and rice). I asked for one chicken and one chorizo and my boyfriend got two carne asada tacos. When I got the order, they made a mistake and gave me two chorizo and no chicken. Disappointed but it was okay since I love chorizo and WOW...the tacos (both chorizo and carne asada) were delicious!  Beans were okay, I liked the rice a lot. We had to ask for hot sauce (nothing offered and nothing on the table). I am not sure what kind of hot sauce we got, it was served in a small ramekin dish, but it was really good and really HOT...adding it to the rice and beans gave them an extra kick they needed.  Sodas come served in a can (so be prepared no refills). I had a large Horchata. It was served in a very large glass, so no skimping on the drink. I have had better Horchata before but this was a close second to some of the best I have had.  Service was a bit slow, but they were very nice and we weren't in any hurry so it didn't really bother us.   Having lived in the southwest for so many years (with frequent visits to Mexico), I feel like I have had some of the best Mexican food there is and my expectations are pretty high.  The tacos here were really good, have definitely surpassed my expectations and cannot wait to go back and have more tacos and even try something else."}
{"text":"Love the colors and atmosphere by far very authentic Mexican Food ! If your looking for authentic Mexican food this is it. We recently moved to Cleveland from Chicago and we've had disappointment after disappointment when it came to Mexican food until we found this place last weekend , excellent service as well"}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short and sweet.  The food is great. Salsa, guac, chips, burritos, etc.   The food is cheap.  The restaurant is clean.  The waiter was extremely friendly but not bothersome.  The location is white trash ghetto but the parking across the street is well-lit."}
{"text":"I am no stranger to down and dirty Mex because I love good, authentic grub.  Good thing me defiendo bien en espanol because our female server didn't understand a lick of English.  No frills interior.  I ordered the chicken and bean burrito.  For $5 it was the largest burrito I have seen in years.  I was totally bummed out by it.  Chicken was, thank god white meat, but no flavor whatsoever.  The beans were seasoned but in a burrito that large I had to seriously dig for them to get flavor.  Too much lettuce.  Booooooorring.  Zzz.   Chips are delicious.  Salsa was okay, nothing great.  And you WILL leave this place smelling like fried food.  Yikes, I wreaked.  As I say in all Mex reviews, I love Villa y Zapata for comparable down and dirty Mex.  Way, way better food and service.    I suggest you don't park like an asshole like I did...But there are literally 4 parking spaces in front of the place."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by what I found here.  The salsa was bland and tortilla chips tasted like they were stale. The rice and beans were better but not anything to write home about. But my molcajete - while greasy - was super flavorful. It saved the entire meal for me. My table mates said that their entrees were well seasoned, too.   Prices are very reasonable. The food is accessible for any budget. The decor is festive, but the low lighting, super loud A/C, and dusty spots were a turn off during the day. And, like others have mentioned, the service is slow. But I think that the entrees are made from scratch.   We were the only patrons on a Saturday afternoon so maybe this is more of a night place?   Bottom line: Glad that I tried it, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Authentic & delicious!  Cheesy decor & no alcohol are only negatives.  Super cheap for the quality.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went here the other night based purely on the limited reviews below.  I was looking for a good taco tuesday place, and Las Dos Fronteras popped up on my map.  I was immediately intrigued by 1) P.W.'s review, which mentioned Le Carnicero and Momocho (YES, I have been to both and nothing against either place, but sometimes I'm just looking for some good, authentic mexican food . . .), and 2) the pictures of the menu, which list tacos for $1.85 each, and the tamales for $1.50.  Seriously?!  How can I not try a place that appears to have homestyle cooking for homestyle prices?  Obviously, everyday is taco tuesday here.  They started us off with a basket of chips, plus 3 different salsas.  My friend ordered 3 tacos, and had to take one home.  It was seriously a good amount of food.  I had the chicken enchilada suisas with the tomato sauce, which came with a generous portion of rice, lettuce, refried beans, and sour cream.  The enchiladas had just the right amount of sauce on top - not smothered, like some other places (cough, Villa Y Zapatas). I also had a couple chicken tamales, which are by FAR the best I've had in Cleveland.  The horchata was delish, and a flan came compliments of the chef. Overall, I'm very excited to go back and try everything on the menu . . . or just order an entire meal of tamales, which were heavenly.   The decor was sparse, but very clean.  It's clearly a family owned/ family run restaurant, and they are open fairly late.  No real private event area, but there is a section that is kind of sectioned off where you could put a dinner party or a group of people.  It's only been open for a few weeks, so I'm not sure if they have their liquor license yet.  But when/ if they do, this place will be first on my list if Mexican restaurants to hang out at!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Chile relleno was very good (except for the hard stem they forgot to remove).  Rice, like home.  Beans, they just alright.  Potatoe flauta was delicious and so was the beef tostada.  The service was great. The young ladies were good with translating what the dish was.  I was disappointed that they didn't have any posole, which is a weekend dish."}
{"text":"Went here Friday 9/6.   This restaurant is the epitome of a mom & pop restaurant.  The restaurant aesthetically is not impressive, however the food is very authentic and the prices were right.  We stuck to the tacos which were great.  I would recommend the chicken tacos as the meat was very flavorful and moist.  In addition my wife enjoyed a chicken tamale with red sauce that she really enjoyed.  Note: This restaurant does not serve alcohol, however my guess is you could likely byob."}
{"text":"My new stop for delicious fresh fast Mexican food.  Tacos were authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was authentic, delicious, served reasonably quick and didn't roll off a food service truck! My picky pallatted coworker is 50% Mexican and agrees this place is worth a return trip or five.  I tried carnitas and  pollo  tamales that were served with a tasty mole sauce. I also ordered carne asada and pollo tacos. The shells were fresh, and the contents were properly portioned so you can eat with your hands!  The meal was completed with some delicious coffee laced with just the right amount of cinnamon. I would come here just to have a cup of coffee and I own a bakery with a really good coffee shop inside.  Quite possibly the best for last, at the persistent proddings of my Mexican friend, I also ordered the horchata!!!!  Wowee Kazowee!! This rice based beverage was like drinking rice pudding pop made from the best rice pudding on the planet! He was laughing at my reaction as  it is such an enjoyable drink!   The ONLY reason the review isn't 5 stars is our waitress was in training and bobbled our order. (And quickly remedied the mistake). To the credit of several other Yelpers, expect a relaxed pace. Maybe even catch a siesta! Your service will not be Chipotle fast, but your food will be worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is currently the BEST latin food in the Cleveland area. It reminds me a LOT of the small Mexican grocer/restaurant places that pop up and close. The only thing more authentic would be to visit someone mexican grandmother and eat tostadas in her kitchen because I'm pretty sure a mexican grandmother is running the grill at this place. Will definitely visit again. Let's keep this one open!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this place, looking for a new spot to eat. It's now one of our favorite hidden treasures. The food is amazing. The salsa and quac taste fresh, the meat is juicy and flavorful and the fried ice cream is to die for.  The staff is very friendly and service is okay. Plus, the decor is fun and feels authentic rather than cheesy, like other Americanized Mexican restaurants.  My only complaints would be the wait we had to endure to pay our bill and the quality of the side dishes. It took several minutes for someone to meet us at the register, the rice was a little dry and some of the tortillas stiff and overcooked.  I will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"I was impressed with this place compared to the outside and the neighborhood. The chips and salsa were good-guac was very limey.  They were out of what I ordered so I had to get something different. I liked the al a carte style of ordering which is unlike most other Mexican places. Overall pretty good and super cheap!"}
{"text":"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be trapped inside the head of a Mexican tripping on Ecstasy? Well, now you can experience it first hand without worrying about your heart exploding.   When you're craving Mexican - I'm talking real, authentic un-Americanized Mexican served in a place where you can break out your rusty high school Spanish skills- there are quite a few good options in the city. We normally head over to El Tolteca in Biddulph Plaza or Mi Casita (formerly Mi Pueblo) on Lorain, but on this evening we were feeling adventurous. At least adventurous for us.  Yeah, it's on the fringes of gentrified Cleveland. You know, the place where the real, working class Clevelander's live. It's far from the maddening crowds and the trying-to-hard 20-somethings and their \"like\"-filled rants about their boring white people problems. It's on a corner connected to a house and it has a brightly lit sign planted in the lawn.  There was a guy sitting on a chair by the kitchen door, maybe the owner?, and he greeted us with a welcoming smile and friendly hello. As soon as we walked in we knew it would be a trip to remember, for better or worse. Remember the aforementioned Mexinsanity? This is where it starts. The small dining room was filled with the deafening sounds of trumpets, nylon-stringed guitarras and \"ahas\" from maniacal mariachi. I'm not exaggerating. We actually had to raise our voices to talk over it.  Tables covered in clear, vinyl. Black and white checkered floor tiles. Orange and green paint. Paper flags hanging from the ceiling. Plastic flower arrangements. But the showcase is definitely the trio of paintings adorning the wall directly to the right as you enter. Flanking a large painting of flowers in a vase are two images. The first depicts a headdressed warrior, shield in hand standing valiantly in front of a giant eagle. The other shows a bow-wielding Montezuma standing over what appears to be a woman, laying asleep (or dead) in flowers. Trippy.  The food is your typical unadulterated Mexican fare. Burritos, tacos, tamales, tostadas, a smattering of seafood selections, rice, beans, asada, pollo, camarones, puerco and various combinations of the above. You can order lengua (that's tongue) as a meat option. Don't be frightened. It's really good.   We sampled several dishes, all of which were tasty. Chorizo tacos, simple and cheap ($1.99 each), the chicken burrito was OK, not stellar, filled with white meat chicken, lettuce, guac, onions, tomato, I expected more heat and spice. Seemed a little bland. The cheese quesadilla served with refried beans and rice was also good. Hard to screw up melting cheese in a tortilla. Some of the best beans I've ever eaten, though. My wife dug her pastor tostada - crispy, fried shell topped with grilled veg and tender pork.  For a couple of gringos it scratched our itch for Mexican food. Service was pretty slow, noticeably so, but friendly. We had no trouble polishing off the chips and salsa (both pretty good) while we waited. No booze here, just canned pop and some Mexican soft drinks. They do have horchata. Try it. And save room for tres leches cake. We didn't and I was bummed. Should have gotten it to go.  Others have pretty much nailed it. It's nothing fancy, no pretension, just the real deal served by the real deal. I'm not sure we'll dine in again but for Mexican take-out I put Las Dos Fronteras pretty high on our list."}
{"text":"Best burritos for very reasonable cost in Cleveland!  (Bring cash for they seem to have trouble working their credit card machine)"}
{"text":"I had a really excellent meal and fun time here on my last day on a recent trip to Cleveland. We wanted something quick and affordable on our way out of town and we found this place based on the reviews. It was a Sunday so the place was packed with families and they had a Mariachi band playing. The service was great - our server was adorable and really attentive. We all loved our food! The pork tamale was extremely good and so was the pork chimichanga! The meat was moist and very tasty. The salsa and chips were also great - fresh and lots of cilantro. My friend got the gorgeous looking shrimp cocktail - wow so pretty and tasty! My vegetarian friends was happy with her veggie fajitas too. The Mariachi band that played was really great, and was also very funny. They did a special seranade for my friend Mary and it really added to the specialness of our weekend trip. They were called ZELAYA. So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"The food is is very good I love the colors in the restaurant. Very nice I will be back.."}
{"text":"We had higher hopes for this little place but we were disappointed.  We had to chase down our waiter.  The daily specials were in Spanish (we could not translate even after we asked our waiter).  My hubby got chicken fajitas. In his words \"there were more peppers than chicken.\"  Honestly, it tasted good but was lean on the chicken.  I got the chicken mole.  No complaints other than it seemed a bit overpriced for the quality.  They had beer but that, too, was overpriced!  One bright spot was the freshly made guacamole - delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place ; every single time I've been here I have had great service ... But it seems to be empty every time I stop by ... I'll be really bummed if they close because their lack of business ; good food , reasonable prices and friendly service to be found together is hard to come by .,"}
{"text":"Que Pasa  Guerro.  This is a pretty authentic Mexican Restaurant with a good selection of Northern and Central Mexican Taqueria style comida.  Chips and salsa were good, nothing outstanding but none the less fresh and tasty.  The were out of red pazole when I arrived but did have green pazole.  For those of you who never had the pleasure of chowing down on pazole,  Mexican hominy  soup which is composed  of  big fluffy  a little bit chewy  Mexican(hominy) corn, a chile based chicken or pork based broth, shredded pork, cilantro, and other Mexican spices. This was pretty good. Only available on the weekends.  We had Panucho al pastor, a couple of tacos and the bistec which is a very thin steak.  Everything was very good except the bistec, it was kind of tough, but that is the way i remember it.  Service was very friendly and efficient.  A little slice of Mexico in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I love the look of this place! It's so fun and festive! They bring you chips & salsa while you wait & it was knock off Tostitos brand so I didn't have to worry about it being too spicey!   They use real authentic Mexican ingredients in their food such as iceburg lettuce, cheese wiz & mozzarella cheese! Mmmmm!   Wondering what kind of veggies are in the \"veggie burrito\"? They are too! They change every day depending on what they have & when I asked what they had today he told me \"whatever is in the kitchen\"- cool! That's specific & helpful in making food choices!  They also gave me a whole tomato in my nachos so I could cut it myself to my liking!   It was expensive but when you use top Ingredients & take your extra special time making something (20 mins for chips with lettuce & whole tomato on top) you need to know your paying for quality service!"}
{"text":"We waited a long time (more than 20 minutes) for our to-go order so we expected the food would be great. My torta de pollo tasted like cat food and after taking a bite I found a hair on it- oh joy. The chicken tacos came in styrofoam wrapped in plastic wrap with the tacos wrapped in foil inside the styrofoam- clearly this means a flavor explosion waiting to happen right? Wrong. Chicken and corn tortilla only- no lettuce, no tomato, zilch. And it was dry. Just super disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is cool if you're into creepy waiters and dollar store tortilla chips. I gave it an extra star because I was really hungry and it was the only place open on the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I went with my friend a while ago and just now have the time to write about this unprofessional restaurant. We found hair in our food and mentioned it to the waiter, not in anger but to let them know someone needs to put a hair net on. The Mexican waiter came back and said I've never had this problem before just with \"you people, you Africans\". I was so baffled I couldn't believe it. I wanted to tell him that I had a degree in Spanish to help his people better themselves! I still can't believe he had the nerve to talk to us like that. One star for the restaurant service as a whole. Would have been at least four if not for the racism."}
{"text":"Well this sure was a surprise!  Authentic Mexican at affordable prices and close to home.  I love some of the West side Mex hot spots, but this is cheap and non-Americanized awesome.  We were able to try some of the red and green \"hot\" sauces with Enchiladas Suizas and Chile     Relleno.  Both excellent and we will return very soon and often for this gem at Clark-Fulton.  If you enjoy authentic no-frills Mexican food, that is not slathered in sauces and cheese, this is your place.  They aren't hiding anything.  I can't wait to try the tamales!"}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh food!!  Very tasty.  Restaurant is very clean staff is very friendly.   Very very inexpensive!  Must try!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you read other reviews on Yelp of a restaurant you've just been to, and you think, \"Are we even talking about the same place?\" Went here on the recommendation of a couple friends. Five of us showed up at around 3 on a Saturday. Sure, the dead hours between lunch and dinner, but they're open and still serving food, right? We sat ourselves and waited about 15 minutes for just drink orders. Oh, and we were The. Only. People. In. The. Entire. Place.   After about 20 more minutes of nothing, another couple enters the place and is immediately taken care of. Their entrees were almost at their table by the time we were ordering. Yikes. It's as if there was only one person in the entire restaurant who had to do both the cooking and the serving. We subsisted on chips and hot sauce for the hour it took to get our food. I got the three-taco dinner with beans and rice. Absolutely nothing to write home about. My buddy agreed, but swore that the tacos the previous time he went were \"mind-blowing.\" So I guess it's one of those places that has magic times of good service and great food? A bummer indeed. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"New management but same great food. And they have a new credit card machine that seems a little more reliable! Don't miss this gem for some in or carry out."}
{"text":"Ate here during the lunch service on 5/12/14.  The ambiance, service, and food were all good.  The guacamole was not as fresh as I'm used to so I brought it up to the waitress and the owner came to apologize which I thought was really kind of him.  The refried beans were great and I'm not necessarily a bean lover. In fact, I think the refried beans here are the best I've had in the city or any surrounding area.  Give them a try, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Please note that there's extra parking across the street."}
{"text":"Shame on you Yelpers! 4 stars? For....? If authentic means dry overcooked meat with no flavor and canned refried beans they nailed it. Our order - taco dinner beef pork tongue was ok, the pork tamale had taste but the pork was dry, they were out of tostadas so the waitress asked if I wanted the same as the bf was having and I agreed  except I did not get that. I got dry stringy flavorless chicken. The place is clean the staff very nice the entire meal was $20 but the items were disappointing. I ate here based on the 4 stars and reviews, some Yelpers need a tastebud rework or I somehow was served the worst Mexican food ever to leave their kitchen."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food. Tacos are amazing with their different meats. Good variety on thier menu."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's gonna be my new favorite cheap, hole in the wall mexican place. The decorations are kitschy and fun (not sure if they're up all the time-- we went just before Cinco de Mayo), the service was very friendly but not overbearing, and the food was affordable and delicious. I got tostados-- the chorizo was delicious. The guac tasted really fresh and good. My roommate got a taco and a quesadilla and it seems like they make the tortillas... which is great! Everything that we had was fresh and delicious, and two of us ate for under $15. No complaints here.  Side note: no liquor, which I'm OK with, but it's just good to know."}
{"text":"My friends and I agree that although it took a long time for the food to come out, it was pretty good. The guacamole is super fresh and seemed like it was made to order. We would definitely eat there again, but probably just for take out."}
{"text":"My wife was in her \"I want Mexican\" mood, so we went to a nearby Mexican restaurant, but it was closed. So I looked on yelp for the nearest Mexican restaurant that was open and it was Las Dos Fronteras. Off we went.  Upon arrival, there were only two other parties in the joint. We seated ourselves and perused the menu. Five minutes later, our server arrived with chips and salsa and took our drink orders. The chips were unevenly and overly salted - some chips had a thick layer of salt on them, making them inedible.  For dinner, I ordered Mole Pablano with chicken and my wife ordered fajitas. My Mole Pablano came with two chicken drum sticks smothered in a tasty mole sauce. I found myself wanting more chicken drumsticks and better yet, a boneless skinless chicken breast. But alas, the meal was tasty. My wife's fajitas were pretty tasty too.  The service, including refills was pretty slow. My wife spoke to the server in Spanish, which the server obviously preferred. At the end of the meal, a different person stopped by to ask if we needed anything else in English.  We'll probably skip this establishment due to average food, service, and poor location."}
{"text":"Has a mom and pop feel. Could use a lil more order and more professional waiters and waitresses. Is the only thing keeping this place from 5 stars but over all great food and low prices!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and experienced super slow service before and after our food - so do not come if you are starving or have something planned soon after your meal - we waited forever just to get our waters, but once we placed out orders out food came very fast. It also took forever to get our check and then get our card back.  With that being said, the food is simply amazing!!  Everything I've ordered is fantastic!  I highly recommend the the street style tacos, chicken sope and the chicken tamale with the green sauce!  Flavorful and authentic :) just don't be super hungry when you get there or in a hurry ;)"}
{"text":"The guacamole is flavorful and has a nice citrus zing. The server was such a sweet girl and I think I have a crush on her now. The owner Adrian is a gentleman. He ensures the dining experience is a great one and asks patrons if they are satisfied. He is originally from Chicago and ran a banquet hall there. I am thankful that he landed in Cleveland. The food here cannot be missed. I recommend Al Pastor, Carne Asada and Pollo tacos. Next time you are craving tacos and want to head to La Plaza, come to Las Dos Fronteras and see what you have been missing."}
{"text":"P.W. Said it all, I was the Carne Asada guy in his review,lol. It's good authentic Mexican, for affordable prices. It's as if you're actually in Mexico paying with pesos. Goya pops come in many flavors and they have many of them. Tacos are very good, too much cilantro can ruin a meal, these have just the right amount.   The location is off in the cut, so you may pass it, but it's there, you can park in the empty lot across the street if there's no spots.   There portions are not nearly as big as Rincon Criollo, or Quisque laBella's for that matter. The taste is there, but more bang for your buck at those places. Unless you want authentic Mexican specifically."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp as I was leaving the zoo with two hungry kids.  The interior was a blast of color and sound, with music over the PA, a soccer game on TV dried flowers on the table, lots of flags and some awesome black velvet Aztec warrior paintings.  It was also clean and well cared for.   The service was quick, attentive and kind, too.  You can get beer now. I ordered a can of Tecate and they served it with fresh lime wedges on the side.   We went al la carte when ordering.   The tacos had real homemade corn tortillas an were 5 stars as were the  refrained beans and the tostada.   My daughter is not as adventuresome so I ordered French fries and a cheese quesadilla for her. Each were only $1.50.   The fries were really good: piping hot and crispy.   The quesadilla would probably be good with salsa .  The location is between the zoo and I-90 on Fulton so it is a great option after a trip to the zoo"}
{"text":"Very authentic. Very fresh and worth the money you pay for. I ordered over the phone to go and they answer in Spanish. They speak English but it wouldn't be a bad idea to brush up on your Espanol. I had the tamale pollo w red sauce and beef taco with their homemade hot sauce. Hot sauce was excellente. I'll be back...this place will be one of my go to authentic Mexican eateries in this area."}
