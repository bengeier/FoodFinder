{"text":"The food is so good not greasy or dry just right.  I usually eat it and feel like I want to crawl into bed and sleep so good. Prices are reasonable $20 gets you a nice size plate. Makes you want to order more for another day.  He delivers and the food is still fresh and hot.  I'll order more food on Friday and you should too. Try it you'll like it.  Love and hugs"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Jamaican food i remember when i fount a place in Colorado you couldn't keep me out of there . So of course when i come home i still crave it but for a while nobody had none that could match the taste i got in Colorado !   Until I saw Jamaican Joint Catering on Instagram and decided to go ahead and place an order ! I ordered the ox tails and my boyfriend got the jerk chicken but he ate the rest of mines  but the food was great and as soon as i tried it i knew i found what i was looking for"}
{"text":"Love the food and service, my plantains wet a bit long but they made sure to handle it"}
{"text":"I brought a plate of jerk chicken at a comedy show i went to that was catered by Jamaican Joint and believe me when i say it was some of the best food i ever had and the dipping sauce was excellent i recommend if you get a chance to get some food from there to get ready to have your taste buds dancing to Jamaican music."}
{"text":"My mother and I wanted to try Jamaican food for the first time and chose this place because of the delivery. The flavors were like nothing we ever had before, oxtails fell off the bone, jerk chicken was wonderful, rice n peas delicious and their signature jerk sauce was outta this world"}
{"text":"The Jerk Chicken Plate was excellent! You wont want to share. I should have gotten 2 plates. Next time Ill know."}
