{"text":"We were looking for a nearby restaurant during a snow storm and stopped in here. With three kids, Mexican is usually a good option for us and this place did the trick. The server was very friendly and fast.   Both my husband and I ordered the veggie burrito and it was fresh tasting and large. I ended taking half home! My oldest daughter ordered a quesadilla and said it wasn't too cheesy, which was a good thing.  While there isn't anything that sticks out as unique here, the food was good and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I noticed they finally opened in the strip mall I work in and decided to give them a try. It was okay. Like the other review, I just wanted something more. It was not horrible, but it was not the best. Just so-so. I will come back and try something new and maybe after they are open for awhile it may be better. The staff was nice and the place was clean."}
{"text":"I had the Mexican tacos with chorizo and they were so delicious and fresh! loved the cilantro and sauces it came with. good prices too!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Colorado and El Burrito Loco comes as close to good Mexican west of the Platte as you can get. My wife and I have been three times now with three different dishes each and thoroughly enjoyed it every time.  El Burrito started out as a State Street family owned food wagon and progress to its current Middleton location. The folks running the place are delightful, funny and friendly. All the sauces are homemade and delicious. Tonight I had their Friday night fish tacos and loved them.  Being in the restaurant business is tough and particularly so in the Madison area. Give this place a try. They deserve the chance to become even more successful."}
{"text":"Just noticed this place a couple weeks ago when I was in the area. So, I decided to give it a try for lunch today. The food was excellent and very inexpensive. I got the chicken chimichanga lunch special for $5 and it came with rice and beans, also. You can choose from cheese sauce or red sauce -I chose the cheese sauce, of course (true Wisconsinite).  The service was prompt, the restaurant was clean, the food was great, and the waiter was very nice. I definitely plan to stop in for lunch, again."}
{"text":"First time to try. Ordered mexican taco platter. The menu says I get to choose 2 but they allowed me 3 options, so I tried chicken, steak and carnitas. I took my food to go but was back at work within 10 min. The food cooled down really quickly but I don't think that was the cause of flavor loss. The food was pretty bland unfortunately even the pico de gallo. I couldn't even taste the cilantro or onions! And No I don't smoke! Maybe more seasoning or salt is needed. Thankfully lime slices were provided. I even added lime to the beans to perk them up. Portions were good. So was the guac. The server was very kind and able to answer my easy question on an allergy I have. I don't think my other allergy requiring a more complex question would have been understood as well thou.  Probably wouldn't go again but maybe worth a try of something else."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  They now have beer and margaritas.  Should expand their menu a little."}
{"text":"Really liked everything, from the spicy salsa and chips, to the little chicken soup, to my chicken enchiladas verde.  I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Had a burrito and everything was fresh. The grilled marinated chicken inside this big giant burrito, was perfectly season. Place's like these should thrive. When it comes to restaurants, these are the places we should patron. Not chains. Please give it a try."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the Mexican tacos: chorizo and carnitas. Wife had the verde chicken enchiladas. Very good chips and salsa and they also brought out a small chicken, rice, cilantro soup with the chips for free that was very delicious!  Very good service, and nice staff.    All of the food was very good quality and fresh tasting.  This is now one of my 2 top places in Madison for tacos!"}
{"text":"Stopped in El Burrito Loco before my Doctor's Appt at the Clinic across the way.  I ordered a standard Steak Burrito, and it was sub-par. The steak wasn't seasoned very well, the rice was watery, and all-in-all there wasn't much flavor. The hot sauce had a very nice kick to it, but again it lacked any flavor (all they need to do is add some garlic, or maybe a little more vinegar). The one plus was that the burrito itself was huge.   Chips & Salsa were extra ($1.99?), which turns me off. The burrito, I believe, was $8.99 which is pretty expensive for a sub-par burrito.  The service was great, and all of the staff were friendly, but I'm not planning on going back.   If  you are in the area, I highly recommend checking out Swagat, which is an Indian restaurant located in the same strip mall. In my opinion, it is the best Indian food in Madison."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good sit down Mexican place in the area and saw El Burrito from the road. We decided to try it out after reading some Yelp reviews, and I am glad we did. We have been twice so far, and the food has been great. The chips and salsa are delicious, the salsa in particular has a nice little kick and a deep tomatoey flavor - though it should be noted that they are not complimentary.  I also really enjoyed how they offer small tasting dishes, the first time we received mini tacos and the second time a soup. Great idea to open up people to the other options on the menu.  My wife ordered the Mexican tacos with ground beef (with cilantro and onions) and loved them, and I got the quesadilla norteno, which was very well made. Others in our party ordered tacos with chorizo, which they said was the best they've had, so I'll have to try it next time we're there."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Madison. I got the Mexicana enchiladas and the breakfast burrito and they were delicious. Both tasted great heated up in microwave later. Food tasted fresh and the rice was not dry like you get at some places. Very pleasant staff and I will be returning many times in the future for the food that I had. Was extremely happy after eating here."}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend, and I had a hankering for Mexican food, so I whipped out my handy dandy cell phone and utilized the Yelp app to locate the closest place to fulfill my hunger. This place was close by and the menu looked appealing.  My husband ran out and grabbed us take-out to eat back in our hotel room. I had the chicken enchiladas verde, and he had some sort of burrito.  My enchiladas were tasty and were gone in no time.  Very good food and fulfilled my craving."}
{"text":"As promised, I came back for those delicious tacos!!!! And this time it was disappointing. I went for lunch. We must be the only customers to begin with. 2 people came when we were about to leave. So they were slow. The taco came looking the same sumptuous kind!! But the corn tortillas were hard and stale. That made the taco quite tasteless. I had pick apart so I can eat it with a fork. Not so good experience. Hope the owners realize, customers won't return if they serve this kinda food"}
{"text":"Do you like Mexican food?  Give this cute restaurant a try. Chips were not free but they were served warm, light and crispy.  The salsa was fresh and tasty.  I ordered the barbacoa burrito.  It was huge and delicious. Other Mexican restaurants use a lot of rice as a filler, but this burrito was stuffed full of mostly meat, with rice,  beans, guac and sour cream.  This restaurant is waiting on its liquor license- should have it by early June.  I loved the mexican music they played - it made for a happy atmosphere!  Very good service."}
{"text":"I really liked the food here. Freshly made sauces and salsas, flavorful, and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed until I was dropping some books off at the Alicia Ashman Library next door. I decided to grab a menu and look it over.   My wife and I decided later that night that we'd go have dinner. It was a little busy but we managed to get some service after a few minutes of waiting. The portions were very generously sized for the price you pay. The chips and salsa were not complimentary. The salsa did have a nice kick though!   I hope this place does well as it's refreshing to have a Mexican restaurant this close to home."}
{"text":"It has been a year and a half since my first review; I'm happy to I have yet to have a sub-par experience here. Living just up the road from here we're in for dinner once every month or so. The chorizo and cheese appetizer has been a favorite for my fiance and I. The carnitas taco platter has also been a favorite."}
{"text":"We were sad when the previous restaurant in this spot (America Latina) closed after only 3 months, but were happy to have another authentic Mexican place take its place! Two barbacoa tacos for only $5.50 is a steal - \"real Mexican street taco style\" with just cilantro and onions. The Quesadilla Nortena with shrimp, mushrooms and onions was really good too. You have to purchase the chips and salsa, but the salsa is sooo worth it. They also have a good hot sauce and a yummy mild tomatillo sauce.  On our second visit I had shrimp tacos - not on the menu, but since they had other shrimp options, I asked them to make them as tacos, and they quickly agreed. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and seasoned soooo well. Street taco style again, but I got the platter that came with pico de gallo, guacamole, rice and beans. Rice and beans were average...I'm not usually a fan anyway, so I'm not a good judge. Hubby got the chicken burrito special - smothered in sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo and enchilada sauce. He loved it. On both visits, the super nice lady who works there gave us a free appetizer sample of their home made chicken and rice soup. Very tasty and definitely tastes home made, traditional chicken soup. Tonight they also had cilantro soup on special, which was creamy and delicious!! The home made horchata is also very yummy. They have flan and other desserts, but so far we have been too full to try them.  There are no other authentic Mexican restaurants on this side of town, so El Burrito Loco is a very welcome addition! We will definitely be back! Please go and visit them, we want them to last longer than the previous tenant!!! We learned that they have applied for their liquor license, so will have beer options soon."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted mexican but also wanted to branch out from our beloved stand-bys (Guadalajara, Jalapeno, Mestiza, etc) so we thought we would try the crazy little donkey.  Trust me, even a crazy donkey would not eat here.   After being seated, we opted for guacamole and chips.  Knowing that this was a small family place (with a food truck downtown), I was expecting a great homemade guac with cilantro, red onions, etc.  Nope, not even close.  The guac tasted artificial and was whipped to a strange almost mayo like consistency.  It definitely was not homemade and either came out of a container or a dry mix. Since we were foolish. we continued on our dining journey and ordered a half pitcher of margaritas.  We were excited to see that you could choose from Don Julio, Patron and other tequilas but that excitement quickly dissipated when we were told they only had rail tequila. Thirsty and still foolish, we went with the rail option.  Right when we saw the margarita, we knew we were in trouble.  It glowed bright neon green and was so sweet, it took only one sip for us to know that we would not have another.  Imagine the worst margarita mix you have ever tasted and then think about what regret would taste like if it had a taste.  Yep, that is how bad it was. So bad, we promptly asked for our check, paid, and left.  One chip with guac and one sip of margarita equals an absolute train wreck."}
{"text":"Really like this little place.  Good food, friendly service, cute ambiance.  We live in a nearby neighborhood and visit once or twice a month.  We've tried a variety of menu items and all are good.  Especially like the cheese sauce with the chips.  Cheap margarita's too.  Not the best you've ever had but they are cheap!"}
{"text":"There was briefly another, different mom-n-pop Mexican joint in this spot that I liked and was sad to see close down. So when it re-opened as El Burrito Loco I had to check it out and see if my dream of a legit Mexican joint close to home would once again come true. I got a tamale platter with a couple of chicken tamales, mole sauce, rice & beans. It was good.   So I'd say, generally pretty legit Mexican food with plenty of menu items to choose from. I think it's run by a family--mom working the register and running food out from the kitchen, and her two sons cooking. At least I think so since the counter lady said \"mi hijo\" (\"my son\") to one of the guys in the kitchen.   So yeah, go support my neighborhood mom-n-pop (mom-n-sons?) Mexican joint!"}
{"text":"Not sure why or how this has so many stars. I ordered the Tortilla Soup and it was horrible. I returned it because there was at least 1/4 of oil sitting on the top of the bowl.  It had white shredded chicken in it in a flavorless brown sauce with nothing other than large tortilla sticks out of it. I also ordered the tacos. They were bland with no salt. All in all, a bad experience. The service was ok. Girl was nice but my son had no utensils and he had to get some from another table."}
{"text":"Excellent little restaurant. We had a delicious dinner. My wife had the chimichanga's and I had the Mexican taco platter (chicken, steak and carnitas...hard shells). The chips and salsa are well worth the price. Salsa is fresh and has just the right zing to it. I also ordered the $2 house margarita (lime on the rocks). Must have. Very tasty.   The service was very good and the decor is bright and fresh looking. There were a few other people on this Saturday afternoon. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals. We sure did and will be coming back. The prices are reasonable and pretty much on par with everyone else. Food is delicious and worth coming back.    The review in the Isthmus was spot on. Thanks for the suggestion."}
{"text":"Overall opinion: I prefer other casual Mexican restaurants.  I went at a slow time (weekday afternoon) and ordered the taco platter, which includes 3 tacos of your choice, rice, beans, pico de gallo, a small side of guacamole, and salsa (mild or hot).  Also lime slice, but it appears this was inadvertently not placed in my order.  The restaurant interior is brightly decorated and clean, and there were a few specials listed on the board.  Rice&beans:  Standard, same as many other restaurants in the area Guacamole: Good, but very small container Pico de Gallo: Did not like, had an acrid flavor, not sure why Chile de Árbol hot sauce: Good, was a welcome addition to liven up the tacos.  Thicker sauce with medium heat.  Carne Asada: I wanted something...more?  Can't quite put my finger on it, but I think a \"grilled\" taste would have been helpful.  Still tasty, though. Carnitas:  The carnitas honestly confused me a little. Carnitas are, of course, cooked twice, first cooking the meat slowly then ensuring the meat gets a little caramelized in the leftover fat.  The carnitas here did not reach the caramelization stage.  It was very reminiscent of when I made slow cooker tacos with a sauce, because the meat was very tender, but no crispy bits from frying.  So it had more of a tomato/mild chile flavor: Barbacoa: I really got 1 big chunk of barbacoa in my taco that pulled apart easily.  But again, I wanted more!  More flavor, more savoriness.  I don't think I will return for tacos, but they do offer burritos, enchiladas, and fajitas (AND clam chowder. Dunno where that came from)"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch. We were seated immediately and the place seems very clean. The people that waited on us were efficient and friendly. There is a sign in the window for $2 Margaritas, but we did not try them. Food came out fast, and it was nice and hot. I had the 3 tacos with carnitas and my dining companion had a molé burrito. The carnitas were really tasty and the tacos had a lot of filling. I am not a fan of molé but my lunch partner said the burrito was good. Both came with traditional rice and beans. One disappointing thing was chips and salsa are not complimentary, and we did not pay the additional charge to order any. I think that should be automatic at a Mexican restaurant. Would definitely return, solid food, reasonable prices. Throw in chips and salsa and that would even raise it up a star!"}
{"text":"Just visited again this weekend and they now have a liquor license!!!!  Bottled beer and a great selection of margaritas now available.  Food and service was again great (poblano quesadilla was delish)!!!"}
