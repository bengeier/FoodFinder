{"text":"Best beef noodle soup in Vegas! And the red pork chop was also very unique and delicious."}
{"text":"The restaurant is open on Black Friday, but only one chef work.
The chef made entrees for a private party only, they only offer appetizer and noodle soup to walk-in customer.
WTF? 
Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"The food is totally legit and brought back wonderful childhood memories. Service was fast and friendly. Price is fair. Nice atmosphere with Flying Tigers memorabilia. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is the true authentic Chinese fusion you don't find anywhere else in Las Vegas.  If you are more adventurous, ask the waitress on what they eat at home.  You won't be disappointed.  Tony Lee DMD"}
{"text":"I went to this place the other day because I love Taiwanese food. I really love beef noodle soup! It's one of my favorites. I have searched far and wide going to various restaurants. 

So, my friends and I went and ordered green onion pancake, beef noodle soup, and green onion pancake with beef. I liked the green onion pancake. It was really delicious and flakey. I did like the one from Easy Earthen in California better, but this is pretty good for Vegas. 

The beef noodle soup was amazing! I think it might just be my favorite. The beef is so tender and soft. I love the broth. It was very flavorful, and wasn't watered down. I would say this is best beef noodle soup I have ever had. 

Service was a little slow here. It might be because the set up is  little difficult to see people because of the huge walls between each booth. I guess they didn't want to spend money remodeling the place. 

The only downside is that they don't have shanghai dumplings. I was so disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. We came in from San Diego and the kids were craving xiao long bao. Everything was excellent. We loved the Kung Pao, the rice and dumplings were also great. Xiao long bao was sooo good. Kids were very happy. Owner and staff are super friendly and helpful. We will be back on our next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Beef tendon noodle (hand made noodle) soup was the best.
Good food, better than their L.A. location. Will come back."}
{"text":"I paid $8.25 for the pork chop, it looks like left over and its half the size from the picture shown on yelp. I spoke to the waitress and her response was \" it is what is is\" /:

Maybe the chef was having a bad day."}
{"text":"Love love love! Ordered spicy wontons, beef noodle soup, homemade potstickers, beef roll, and a couple of their cold dishes - everything was A+! Will definitely be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best noodle in Vegas. I will come back again for the tender beef noodle. Price was fair was well. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"The authentic Taiwanese flavor in town. Just exact I taste I remembered when I was a kid in Taiwan. This is the best place in town. I want to come back again and again. The dumpling is as good as Dong TaiFung. And the cold noodles is good for the summer season."}
{"text":"Being a resident of Vegas for over 14 years, I have eaten at most restaurants worth eating at in Chinatown. This by far is one of the best and authentic Taiwanese food we have in sin city. Beef roll is def worth trying. I usually get the pork chop rice plate, beef roll  and wonton soup for lunch. 

Pros: authentic, almost home cooking. Price is very reasonable. 

Cons: not much I can think of. But I will update my review if I discover any cons next time I eat there"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bice find with authentic Taiwanese dishes. We were here for lunch and the menu items were all under $5 (not sure if that's the same for dinner).

We had cucumbers and tofu with preserved egg as starters, then had beef and tendon noodle soup and cold noodles. The portions for the noodle dishes were smaller than what you would expect for entrees but obviously you shouldn't expect that for $5 or less. They were tasty nevertheless. We added an order of boiled dumplings as we weren't quite full. They were also good. 

Overall the food was good with prompt and friendly service. Would come back again to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I've long heard of this famous restaurant chain in Ca and was delighted to see it finally find its way to Las Vegas. It's not just Chinese cuisine but the rarely found authentic Taiwanese cuisine! My favorite are the beef rolls, sesame dry noodle with shredded chicken, and the tomato flavored minced pork dry noodle. Oh, don't forget to order the yummy side dishes in small plates. Perfect campion to the noodles or beef rolls. 

But that's not it! At night, it has even more selections on the menu with the rare lamb soup, pineapple pork bone soup, and the fish soup. Can you tell I love soup? The soup is definitely a large enough size with lots of veggies and other stuff to make two to three people full. All you need is some scallion pancakes to go with it!"}
{"text":"They've just recently moved to this location on Flamingo, and while it's not in the heart of Chinatown, I really think it's a nicer dining environment. Their menu has changed to combine the old Liang's Kitchen and China Mama, which is an affiliated business. I like the new menu better because it's more diverse and more than just the street style Taiwanese cuisine, which is great too. My favorite by far is the stuffed minced pork pocket and the Shanghai stir fry sticky rice cake. Can't get enough of it."}
{"text":"Coming from Philadelphia, it was a struggle to find good Chinese food in Las Vegas. I am sooo glad yelp helped me find Liang's. This place is now one of my go-to's and although everything menu sounds amazing, it's hard to deviate from our favorites! You can't go wrong with the beef roll, the best soup dumplings in Vegas, and eggplant with Sichuan garlic sauce. If you can only get one dish order the beef roll, cilantro, thin slices of beef and an amazing freshly made wrap! If you love Chinese food check this place out."}
{"text":"Food is very authentic, such a pleasant surprise to eat good Taiwanese food in vegas. We got the minced pork noodle and beef tendon soup.both excellent."}
{"text":"Good food at steeper prices than other Chinese restaurants. Not super expensive but enough to arch an eyebrow for a casual environment such as this one. Hubby loved the model airplanes and Taiwan memorabilia, this restaurant does feel like a personal labor of love. Service was ok, but minimal, and while the waitress peered over a couple of times never really came to check in on us and we had to go to the cashier to ask for the check. A lot of their dishes seem to favor vinegar and sweetness which I had to get used to, such as the seaweed appetizer. Would love to come back to try the soupy buns. Entrance of restaurant is the right door as hubby almost inattentively walked into the center door which is actually a real estate company."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Taiwanese restaurant i had for dinner tonight. Yeah dishes are tasty and pretty good portions servings. Must try the Sliced Fish Fillet in Hot Chili OMG that was to good and my rice went down great."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we came in on a Tuesday where they don't have the normal menu because the main chef is off. 

So we ordered the 
-beef roll
-pork chop rice
-soup dumplings
-beef stew noodle

Beef roll is described as a scallion pancake wrapped in they sliced beef. The pancake texture was just right, it was not too crunchy or too raw in terms of under cooked dough

Pork chip rice wasn't the most impressive dish but the rice they used was great compared to all the other Chinese rice I've tasted

Soup dumplings - the wrap they used tasted a lil bit Chinese, but at least it is fresh and not frozen. The filling was bigger than most soup dumplings I've tried. I wished there were more soup inside. The temperature was just right and not scorching when it came out. Overall not the best soup dumplings I've had but well worth a try

The beef noodle stew was my favorite. The soup was not too oily like a lot of restaurants I tried and it has an interesting spicy taste to it. The beef is what stood out, it melted in my mouth in comparison to most which is really dry

I rated this 5 stars because this tiny hole in the wall should get a lil more recognition in terms of food and a great staff or at least our waiter"}
{"text":"Had an early lunch here today and it was great. Had the eggplant, Minced beef rice, Mongolian beef, soup dumpling. Soooo much food. The portions are huge and the quality is great. I was really surprised by how good the eggplant was. I'm not a big eggplant fan. But it was delicious here. 

The service was also superb. They really helped with the order and made good suggestions. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. Prices reasonable especially when you consider how much food they give you.

All around easy 5 star with this place. Fantastic Taiwanese food!"}
{"text":"So far all the food we ordered was really good. We had the ??? by far the best in Vegas,  hot & sour soup (good flavor) and steam pork bun ( soft and fluffy on the outside and flavorful on the inside). Will be back to try  other goodies next time....back again the second time and food went down hill , it's doesn't taste the same ...will not return"}
{"text":"Was at dinner the other day with my friend and she mentioned how a new taiwanese place opened. She said the name was something kitchen... and it reminded me of Liang's Kitchen in San Jose when i went up there in 2011. Then she looked it up, and confirmed it was Liang's Kitchen. My face with from :o to *_* Lol ! Was so excited for the next few days (Thurs to Sun... so 3 days) to go try it out ! I remembered the location i went to was super busy, their beef noodle soup was amazing, served hot in a metal bowl. Their noodles were hand-made, varying size showing it was not machine made. Been wanting to go back since every time i go up to the Bay but never had the chance !

So it opened in Vegas... Finally a new Taiwanese place ! and its one i recognize ! w00t ! It sits on the north end of the complex, on the NE corner of Spring Mountain and Arville, replacing what used to be called Hot Feel. Minimal renovations were done after the take over of the unit with some reorganization of some tables. 

The menu and ordering paper is about the same, if not the same as other locations. Price wise, i dont remember. Came to try this place with a few friends for dinner. We had initially ordered a few things. 1 Beef Roll, 1 Green Onion Pancake, and 2 Large Beef Tendon Noodle Soup (later i realized the L/R next to the name was large and regular NOODLES, not the size of the order OOPS hahaha o well)

Beef Roll and Green onion pancake came out first

Green Onion Pancake - normal green onion pancake but fried? (is that the right term). The exterior was crispy, interior was soft and hot ! Not a fan of the fried version after a previous experience at another restaurant, but this was really good ! Especially since it was fresh and HOT ! :D i liked it 

Beef Roll - Essentially a green onion pancake wrap with braised beef, cilantro, and hoisin sauce. Not as hot as i had expected in comparison to the green onion pancake. I had ate the green onion pancake first so i thought this was going to be as hot. Overall, not bad. Not too sweet and overpowering by the sauce. Fairly nice balance. We had ordered this another time after and crispy exterior on the 2nd order was flaking off. Looked a bit ugly. XD (being called high maintenance for stating this... T_T)

Beef Tendon Noodle Soup - We had ordered 2 with large noodles. 1 came out first before the other. The first order, as large as i had remembered. Lots of noodles, in a large metal bowl. Lots of preserved veggies and stuff on top. 2nd one, not so much... Amount of noodles was probably 1/2 of the first order. Inconsistency? Maybe. Didn't matter too much since we were sharing so the noodles were fairly split anyway, so not so bad overall, but still, a bit weird to have varying amounts on the same table. Flavor wise, pretty good ! Large noodles were uneven (lol as expected of handmade) and al dente ! The noodles were actually a LOT larger and wider than i had expected (to be honest, i dont remember how it was in San Jose). In a small sharing bowl, putting like 3 strands of noodles fills it up. Thats how big the noodles were. Beef was tender. Tendon was soft. Flavor overall was nice. A little sour kick (from the preserved vegetables probably). Next time, i wanna try the regular noodles. Memory is failing me XD

Shanghai? style wonton - friend wanted to order this. Small wontons (maybe 10-15 in an order) in a seaweed soup broth Nothing too special. So recognizable amount of shrimp in the wonton (not sure if shanghai style has shrimp? HK style certainly does). Wasn't a favorite but at least we've tried it? Lol

Servers tend to speak to you in mandarin (3 out of the 5 of us spoke cantonese. 1 of the 2 mandarin speakers didnt pay attention). yeah we fail rofl. Overall, not too bad. 

Would love to come back to try other things. I believe they have lunch specials as well. Prefer to have had them open in a different location but oh well."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner unexpectedly, suggested by family from a recommendation from mom's coworker, and recently visited by some friends as well. Liang's Kitchen used to be in Chinatown but I guess recently moved (within 1-2 years). Weird that it had moved to a location where it has changed a few times and next to a real estate brokerage. Liang's Kitchen was a restaurant I was familiar with having in San Jose a few years ago. Popular Taiwanese style cuisine known for their noodles and other items. 

Xiao Long Bao (8) - Steamed dumplings with pockets of soup within. When done well, its amazing. When we got our two orders, we had started to eat them as soon as it was delivered. Upon delivery to table, they already looked a bit shriveled up. When eating the XLB, some had maybe a few drops, some maybe a little more. None of the XLB where plump and full of soup. The meat texture was rough and a bit overcooked feeling. 

Pan Fried Chive/Pork Buns (6) - \"shang jian bao\" is typically a \"bao\" filled with pork or other ingredients, cooked in a pan from raw to where the bottom half of the bun forms a really crispy/crunchy crust with the top half still being soft. Their version has a very minimal crust to where it almost seemed like they pan fried it for a minute or two, and threw it all into the steamer. The bun itself was very \"soft and moist\" on the outside. You have the choice of chive or pork or you can split the 6 buns half pork and half chive. Those with chive will be differentiated with a sprinkle of black sesame seeds on top. Filling flavor wise was nice and not over-done. Pork style is mainly pork. Chives is mainly with chives, glass noodles, and egg. 

Mama's Special Pan Fried Chive/Pork Buns (8) - \"shui jian bao\" apparently a derivative of the \"traditional\" \"shang jian bao - pan fried bun\", is an interesting dish. Similar to a pan fried bun but they pan-fry the buns with either some water or broth creating a crispy bottom later, similar to what you may have seen in other restaurants done with dumplings called maybe \"crystal dumplings\". The crispy bottom layer is yummy to eat itself and often not enough for people to pick at XD. Surprisingly, being a \"water-fried\" bao, the bao itself was \"drier\" than the pan fried bun previously. Didn't exactly make sense. LOL. Same as the previous pan fried bun, they are offered in a chive or pork version and able to split half and half. Same type of filling. 

Beef Roll - typical style beef roll where thinly sliced beef with cilantro and sauce rolled in a green onion pancake style of wrap. 2 wraps cut into 4 servings each per order. Nothing special but not bad either. Would have preferred a little more beef. Seemed a little lacking in amount. Sauce amount was good. Not too much, not too little. 

Pork stuffed Pocked Bread (4) - out of the buns/wraps, this was probably the best. little hard to describe but ill try my best. From my speculation, these are similar to those \"jian bing\" in shanghai where they create a thin crepe-like wrap, add ingredients, and fold to create a closed pocket. Cook the sides enough to create a crispy texture, cut in half, and serve. As the name may suggest, they are minced pork stuffed \"pockets\". Kind of similar to this chive pocket that I love eating. Would be great if they added chives to this too but the pork itself was nice and flavorful. Additional $3 gets you 2 more pieces.  

Shanghai style thick noodles - one of the two suggested items by mom's coworkers and one of my two favorite items to order in terms of shanghai cuisine. To my disappointment though, they did NOT use thick noodles... if in fact, they were fairly thin noodles. Flavor wise, was pretty nice. Not too salty. Just sad about the noodles. That's one of my favorite aspects of this dish. Also has thin pieces of pork, spinach, and napa cabbage cooked with the noodles as well.  

Shanghai style rice cakes - the other favorite item I usually order. Amount wise, it was a little smaller than expected. Flavor, same as the thick noodles. Though TBH, besides the difference of noodles vs rice cake, I think they are almost the same XD. 

Lion's Head in Hot Pot - my family's favorite dish of the meal. Lion's head is a shanghai staple item often known as the \"Chinese meatball\". Lol cooked and braised to a perfection in a hot pot. Soft meatball soaked in flavor. its almost hard not to eat a bowl or two of rice with this. My uncle and cousin went through a few bowls themselves on this dish alone. HAHA. Outer layer of meatball dusted in a starch of some kind and fried, creating a skin similar to a fried tofu, then braised in a savory sauce. Oh so good :) 

Funny, them being a Taiwanese based restaurant, they did better on shanghai dishes than the Taiwan ones. Granted some are Taiwanese as well but some may understand. 

Overall, not bad of a place. Pricey though. Id probably return for the lions head hot pot or similar but not the dumplings/bao."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the sliced garlic pork belly, smoked ham with leek, shredded beef with peppers, tofu with shrimp/peas/carrots, pickled bamboo shoot, three-cup chicken, A vegetables, and pickled cucumber. The tea was excellent."}
{"text":"Came here because they served soup dumplings but the green beans were the star of the show"}
{"text":"New menu items - Authentic Chinese tapas style with each plate less than $5.  Great selection with delicious taste. Must try."}
{"text":"Very good place. Nice people here.  They have the best beef noodle soup and fair price also. I think they were the first mama kitchen in vegas. And they moved to this location. We will keep coming."}
{"text":"Onion oil noodle with egg was good!  Beef noodle soup was a little bland, but the wide noodles were good. Three cup chicken was ok."}
{"text":"Came here 2 days in a row. So yummy! The fried veggie buns and beef tendon noodle soup are my favorites! Also thank you for the nice service!"}
{"text":"Very bad, won't going back again, the beef noodle soup has no taste to it, the stinky tofu taste very stink but not the normal way with bitter taste, sorry for saying that but just like coming out from the bathroom disgusting!"}
{"text":"I came here for the fried onion noodle- and was disappointed. The dish a few trusted local friends and elites recommended either doesn't work at all as a takeout dish or I just had a dismal experience, so consider yourself warned. The a-choy vegetables (also frequently recommended) are good, consider them with the dish of your choice, or dine in for a better experience.

I actually tried to have the fried onion noodle dish a few times- once, I called in for takeout and was helped by a woman who didn't speak much english and insisted that they no longer had that dish on the menu. I came in another time, couldn't find it on the menu, and opted for an unmemorable beef-noodle dish. This final visit, I was at last able to try it- but the noodles were overcooked and clumped, the onions were minimal, and the egg was over.

Location has two menus: the formal menu with English/character dish names and photos does not have any prices listed. There is a separate checklist menu with just names and prices, no descriptions. Neither are especially conducive to an organized ordering experience."}
{"text":"I wasn't satisfied at all with my takeout order at Liang's Kitchen. I ordered the Noodle soup with Taiwan Bok Choy. It was just noodles with broth; no Bok Choy whatsoever. The chives turnover was overly salty and subpar also. I will not return to Liang's Kitchen. They suck in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wonderful food!! We got tired of buffet on strip and came here for good Chinese food. Everything under $5, so you can try a little bit of everything. Love the authentic three flavor chicken with the ginger green onion sauce the most! The chive box needs more salt though."}
{"text":"our waitress was super nice and thats pretty much the only good impression i had with this restaurants. we ordered the beef soup noodle and 3 sauces chicken dish. beef soup noodle was a bit salty and the there werent alot of chicken portions on the dish for the money they charged. on top of that, steam rice wasnt fresh. it tasted like left overs from days ago. wouldnt come back again."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Taiwanese restaurant in town. I had been looking for the right place and this one is the right place. I love their spicy chicken and their 3 cup chicken. Quite tasty if you like spicy!"}
{"text":"Was out in Vegas for work and feeling a little home sick.  So I searched Taiwanese food and found Liang's Kitchen.   The first night I went and ordered their beef noodle soup, it was right before closing so I got it to go.  The noodles and beef were delicious and exactly what I was hoping for.  The next time I came in for lunch and ordered the pork and rice combo, just like the way my mom would make it.  Finally I tried their Taiwanese sausage combo and again delicious.  I will definitely be coming back here whenever I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered the xiao long bao the chicken fried rice and the sizzling peppered steak.  The wrapper was nice thin for a correct xiao long bao dumpling, the fried rice was really fresh with fresh ingredients.  The sizzling beef was off the chain!!!  This place is a FIND!  Took me awhile to find a good authentic Chinese place definitely recommend this place.."}
{"text":"We waited for more than 15 min and no one even greeted us... when I tried to ask for service, the lady just ignored us. I understand that they are busy but at least greet us and let us know the situation. We left after 15 min and 2 groups after us also left the restaurant for NO customer service."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service.  Discovered this little gem three weeks ago and have been back 4 times since. I have enjoyed every dish and I love the shrimp and pineapple fried rice."}
{"text":"The handmade noodle ( they called it\"lapian\") tastes very good. We ordered beef noodle soup and clear beef noodle soup. The clear beef noodle soup tastes good and lite. They also offered Taiwanese stinky tofu, so you may smell some of it."}
{"text":"I was most impressed. The Kung Pao Chicken was really unique. Most of the people. Including me had enough for take home packages. Friendly service, nice atmosphere. I'm going to try to return today."}
{"text":"Food is good, had the pork chop w/rice and the beef noodle soup. Pork chop was done well and crispy. Beef was very tender in the soup. Love the decor of the place even though some may find it odd to have model planes and ww2 memorabilia. Also enjoyed the 40's music while I was there."}
{"text":"We tried out this place today as it had pretty high ratings here on yelp.

The ambience was cool and the waitstaff were friendly, but the food was subpar and made my stomach upset. This is not something you'd normally expect for how expensive the menu items were. 

The hot and sour soup we ordered tasted good, but the potstickers seemed to be previously frozen, and the chicken in the Chao Mein was oddly textured and faintly metallic."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to us. I ordered a spicy pork with wide flat  noodles and noodles were delicious, very chewy and fresh . The broth is a bit too oily for my taste so I think I'll try to order a beef noodles next time. My husband ordered pork chop rice with egg, and it wasn't good because the deep fried pork was not crunchy and it's kinda old because it's a bit dried and oily . So we won't order that dish next time but I will definitely give it another try with other dishes"}
{"text":"Have been here several times,easy parking bad location.food is average.portion is small.Just try the pig feet rice.Only 3 small one on dish.Service is good.They just move from China town with all the fighters model too."}
{"text":"Service when I went last week was bad. Came in on a Sunday afternoon. It was empty yet they sat me in the back, barely paid attention to me. I had to get up to ask for a menu. The two sets of other customers were sat in the front, they were serviced pretty quickly. There were a good amount of items on the menu they were out of. The food was okay. I ordered dan dan noodles and whatever dumpling they had available. I also ordered the beef roll and another dumpling to go. Beef roll was great but they didn't pack any condiments with my food to go."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for home cooked Chinese food and randomly searched \"Chinese Food\" near this area. I recognized Liang's Kitchen from the other chains I've been to.  The location can be difficult to find for the first time. The main entrance to the plaza is on spring mountain road, and it's located in the Arville Square Plaza. The restaurant sits way back in the plaza, perpendicular to most of the other stores. We ordered 4 individual dishes and an appetizer: beef noodle soup, beef tendon noodle soup, pork chop rice bento, pork chop noodle soup, and wonton in chili oil.  Everyone was happy with their order, but the only thing I'd recommend is asking the cook to separate the pork chop from the soup to prevent sogginess. The portions were decently sized (I couldn't finish my bowl of noodles), and the staff is really nice. I asked for extra small side veggies that came with some of our dishes and the staff had no problem giving us more. Overall, clean restaurant, plenty of seats, nice decor, pretty good tasting Chinese food, and well priced (our bill was around $41 sans tax).  There's plenty of other options for Chinese food around here but this is definitely a place we would come back to!"}
{"text":"Great food fresh to order friendly service can't wait to come back! Of the strip no wait time a little hidden gem Try it you'll be glad you did"}
{"text":"This is the most authetic taiwanese food in vegas recommended beef noodle cold noodle pork chop rice is delicious! Atmostphere is cool"}
{"text":"AMAZING. I'm from the Bay Area and I was skeptical at first, but all doubts wen away. This place is phenomenal. The food is amazing, the staff is kind and patient, and overall the experience was some of the best Chinese food I've had in the United States. 

Wish I had more starts to give!"}
{"text":"If you're a Filipino and you are familiar with Lingnam's noodles in Ongpin Chinatown Manila, the beef stew noodles here is exactly that. I have been craving that noodles for so long and has been looking for it in almost all Taiwanese restos I go here in Vegas. I am so happy I found it. This is my 2nd visit in 2 weeks time lol."}
{"text":"We've been missing the food and old crew from China Mama so we are so happy to reconnect with them here.  If you went to China Mama on Spring Mtn Jones and loved it before, this is what you are looking for.  Don't go back to the other place!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and liked their food. 

They located on the blue building on Flamingo and Lindell. They shared parking lot with a realtor offices next door but I was able to find parking easily, plenty of parking space around. Building was a little old but they kept things clean and unique on the inside. 

I ordered their pocketed bread stuffed with pork $9.99 and LOVED it! The outside sesame pastry was crispy and the pork stuffing inside was tasty! Super good and must try! 

I also had their dry noodle with beef $10.25. I chose thin noodle and thought it was pretty good. The beef brown sauce had a strong pepper spicy taste. So if you are not a fan, you should probably ask for less sauce. Other than that, I thought their portion and food were good. 

Prices were higher than other  noodle place around the area such as Shang Noodle but still reasonable for lunch. 

Service was excellent. I was able to get in and out within the hour and had plenty of time to enjoyed my lunch! Hot tea was a complimentary too. 

Will come back again and try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after seeing reviews on Yelp. Even though there were only a few posted, each one seemed solid so we decided to give it a try.

My first impression was good! Lots of Asian restaurants can be quite dingy, dark, and dirty. However, Liang's is modern, well decorated, and clean! I loved the planes that hung on the ceiling. Our server told us the owner's husband used to fly planes in Taiwan. So cute! I loved that they added their personal touches but in a cute way rather than random.

What we ordered:
Bok Choy with mushrooms and bamboo shoots - holy shit get this! These three ingredients complimented each other very well. The sauce it was cooked in was delicious. The Bok Choy was tender, another plus. We really enjoyed these veggies. 

Fish with hot chili sauce - We asked them if they could make it mild AF, they said it was no problem! Came out pretty quickly in a huge portion. Could need a little more salt but still good and we devoured every bit of it. I dipped a few of the pieces in vinegar and enjoyed it. 

Shrimp two ways - Pretty good! Half cooked in a sweet and sour-esque tomato sauce while the second half was a more simple sauté. Again, a huge portion, but this dish was also on the pricier side. Prob wouldn't this again but it was good!

XLB - Not the best XLB I've had, but still hit the spot!!

Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at Liang's. The service was prompt and friendly! This can be quite rare at an Asian restaurant so that was another huge plus. Definitely will be back to Liang's next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best chinese food.especially the noodles I just love everything they have in there!"}
{"text":"Good little spot. Nice service, very clean and a fun menu.  Can't wait to try everything. Handmade noodles and that beef soup are enough reason to return alone."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food ,all my kids loved it!
I\"m usually picky about the restaurants that I dining in,but I loved this one,feels like home!"}
{"text":"\"A kiss is not just a kiss
A smile is more than a smile...\"

Every month a handful dishes hang on your tongue reminding you of how great they were while inviting, downright pleading you to come back. Liang's Kitchen has one of these dishes, their Fried Onion Noodles. These noodles a coated in onion & garlic oil, placed under an over-easy egg, and topped with pan several small slices of pan-fried onions. I order it with a second egg and add a little of their chili paste, resulting in what some have called perfection. 

I also usually get the Snow Vegetable & Noodle Soup w/ Pork Soup Broth. The broth has a wonderful flavor from the pork bones, but still drinks lite. Additionally, I've enjoyed the Beef Roll, Scallion Pancake, as well as the A-Choy. The prices make it very easy to order more food than you can eat in one sitting...typically resulting in a nice lunch the day after."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and inexpensive! Why didn't I come sooner!!! Was too hungry and forgot to take pics  lol but the food was great and it's cute inside it's like little tapas and I love that"}
{"text":"Really bad experience, I went there to order food to go,I told them at list three times to make sure I don't want cilantro,but they still put them in one of my order,and then,they made a new one without ask me,so it tooks another 30 minutes.the rest of my stuff like noodles all goes so bad.when I got home and open them,I can't eat them,cuz they were so dry and hard.The funny thing is,the new one they made for me?still has the cilantro!!!I can't believe that.Never go back again!"}
{"text":"I tried their fried pork chip rice yesterday. The pork chop is not too crispy and flavorless. They only give you 2 veggie side dishes and 1 tea leave egg. Other side dishes: bean spout has a light flavor and mustard veggie is light too. The overall taste is OK! But I can see the whole box contains a lot of oil. If you want to charge 11 dollars for a bento box, then you should make sure it's worth it. 
Compared to little kitchen-pork chop rice, they give you 4 side dishes which are not flavorless. Although  their pork chop was a bit over cooked the day when I tried, it is only 8 dollars. 
I'll choose little kitchen I guess."}
{"text":"Love the beef wide noodle soup. Delicious. Plus they have wifi so that my spoiled toddler can watch her tv shows on her iPad. Yeah I know, I'm one of those parents, but I get to eat!"}
{"text":"There used to be a little Taiwanese/Chinese noodle spot we used to eat at once a week when we lived in Irvine, CA. One day that noodle spot closed down its doors for unforeseen reasons. We were so upset about it. One day that noodle spot decided to opens its doors again but in Vegas!!! So stoked! And it's yummy like we remember it. What makes them special is their freshly hand pulled wide noodles. Perfection! 

Here's what we always order: 

Beef noodle soup (make sure to get it with the fresh wide hand pulled noodles) $8.25 - This location's was a little different than the California's version; I remember having the most tender beef cubes, however, this time around the meat was much chewier. The best parts of this dish is always the unique, thick noodle sheets, rich broth, and divine pickled vegetables. I always insist that they bring extra pickled vegetables for me to add to my soup. It has such an explosive flavor combination with the bold and beefy soup broth and somewhat welcoming sweet notes. This dish is a classic and a perfect start to get your foot in the door at Liang's. Flavor rating 5/5

Fried Onion Oil Noodles (get this with the thin handmade noodles) $7.25 - Oh the simple pleasures! This comes with a perfectly fried egg on top, you'll want to break that yummy egg and let it run down into the noodles and coat everything. Don't get me wrong, It's an extremely simple dish; just noodles, fried onions in oil and a glorious fried egg - but something about the fried onion aroma just bumps the noodles up a few comforting notches. Truly a fat Asian kid's/poor man's comfort food. Flavor rating: 5/5

Green Onion Pancake $5.25 - If you didn't know, this is like the french fries of Taiwanese/ Chinese cuisine. They are completely dunk-able as well. The right way to do it, is to enjoy these crispy oily delights with your beef noodle soup or even the fried onion oil noodles. However you want to enjoy them together is up to you, whether it's dunking away or munching on it after each bite of noodles. They are meant to be eaten together. This is as ingenious as dipping your biggie fries into a Wendy's frosty. Mind blown? Have fun with the experience! Flavor rating: 5/5

Super PRO TIP: Don't sleep on that table-side chili oil. It makes these dishes sing. So perfect in the beef noodle soup and the onion oil noodles."}

Good service

XLB not that good
Beef roll (better at the noodle man but not bad here)
Spicy won ton (sauce was different in a bad way)
Pork chow mein (not bad)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to describe this place but it's not a typical Chinese restaurant. First of all it's attached to a real estate office which is kinda odd. When you walk in there are about 50 model war planes hanging from the ceiling escorting you to your table. The menu is not the American style Chinese food but is more authentic type I've had in China on past trips. The food was excellent and the portions were the right size not oversized but not skimpy. I had the Mongolian beef and it was very tender and had plenty of flavor. I also had the chow main like noodle dish but I had them make it with the wide noodles.   This is the only place in Las Vegas where
they hand make the noodles and you can tell. They have such a wonderful consistency with a fresh taste. The only negative I found was that the service was absolutely horrible. It was slow and almost non existent. Besides having to wait a long time to place my order I had to go up to the counter to get napkins and silverware for my son. It took even longer to get the check and a to go box. This place would be great if the service would improve here."}
{"text":"This is a great off the strip Chinese food restaurant. We wanted juicy pork dumplings and we found them! Delicious... also had the crispy beef and chicken fried rice. No disappointments here, everything was great, including the service. Better than any Chinese food restaurant that we've eaten on the strip. Hidden gem. Thank you Yelp for this find! 
Oh by the way, the war fighter jet planes hanging from ceiling does throw the decor off a bit :)"}
{"text":"I first visited Liang's Kitchen after reading a glowing review in a recent Las Vegas Weekly magazine.  Liang's Kitchen is Taiwanese cuisine.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they had changed the menu since that review, reduced the size of portions, and that all menu items are now $5.00 or less.  .

This afternoon when I entered, there were only 6 empty tables, with none of the empty dishes having been cleared away.  I ordered the beef wrap and beef & tendon soup.  The soup was brought very promptly, but when I finished eating the homemade noodles, beef, tendon, and vegetables, I realized I had not been given a spoon.  After finally catching the waitress' attention I finally got a spoon.  But I had to ask for hot tea 3 times, and when it finally arrived, it was a pot of hot water and a tea bag on a separate plate.  This is not typical of Chinese restaurants!  Also tea is generally brought as soon as you sit down.

When the owner's son or the male waiters are there, they are very attentive.  However, the female waitress on duty this afternoon was totally inattentive.  As I was finishing my meal, the empty tables when I came in, were finally being cleared.  But I observed something rather unusual.  On one of those tables, most of the food had not been eaten.  The customers had been long gone.  The waitress packed that uneaten food in take-out containers which she then took back into the kitchen.  I'm not sure that is in compliance with health regulations.  Was the waitress planning on taking that leftover food home and eating it herself later!"}

{"text":"Good place for Taiwanese food. The service was good but the delivery of the food to the table was very slow. Also pretty pricey for Taiwanese food. Found this place after lots of places around here didn't have sufficient parking. Ordered the pork chop rice and it was good."}
{"text":"Chinese food in the Las Vegas area is surprisingly plentiful and delicious. This one is a chain from California but still, it was pretty good.

We ordered a massive amount of food: xiao long bao, shengjianbao, beef noodle soup with fat noodles, beef tendon, seaweed, spicy wontons, and green onion pancakes.

I wasn't a huge fan of the baos, and I've had much better. I think they didn't have enough soup. The other dishes were decent though. They do give you a lot of food.

The place has a very home-style feeling to it as well, including the decor.

I'm sure my family will be back again."}
{"text":"If there were zero star, I would!! I'm very disappointed in this place. DISTASTEFUL!! The restaurant opens at 11am, and the chef is still no where to be found at 1pm. We ordered our food, after 15 minutes, the staff told us that they don't know when the chef is going to arrive and asked us to order other appetizer first. After waiting for 30 minutes, the staff asked us to order noodle soups instead because they don't know when their chef would arrive. The noodle soup came after 10 minutes and it's absolutely DISGUSTING! Don't waste your money and time here!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Best Asian cuisine I've had in many years!! The pork \"pockets\" are simply amazing. 

Food is simple, fresh and very a great fusion of Chinese food. 

I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Taiwan style Chinese food.  I really enjoyed dining here.  

Highly recommended.  

I would go back and eat again."}
{"text":"Came in bc I was craving soup dumplings this Sunday at lunch. When I walked in I noticed there was no other patrons in the entire restaurant at 11:25 a.m. albeit most people don't come to restaurants like this for brunch.

Started with the cold seaweed which was surprisingly good. Then followed by the Xiao long bao. The broth of the Dumpling was pretty mediocre however I kept putting dollops of chili sauce on it mixed with a little bit of the vinegar solution that they put on the table. 

Next was the pork pockets pastries. These were actually quite good as it was pork sauteed with hot peppers and other spices stuffed into a nice Sesame pastry. This was by far the best thing I tried here.

Lastly the entree we had was the green onion chicken. I was unaware that this dish came out room temperature to cold and was pretty bland tasting. And to be honest I really could not get past the texture of the chicken skin and Bland meat texture. 

The service here was good, however the food here is pretty mediocre in comparison to other places I have tried on the East Coast."}
{"text":"My buddy and I decided to give this place a try due to their high ratings (despite only 17 reviews). We split the sesame pocket bread with minced pork, pork chop with rice, and a half order of duck. 

Sesame pocket bread- It was pretty solid but a little bit dry. I enjoyed the flakiness of the bread, and the minced pork was flavorful. 
Pork chop- the pork chop was seasoned well but a little too sweet for my liking. The minced pork on top of the rice was a nice addition to the dish (probably same minced pork from the pocket bread). 
Half duck- no bueno. I thought it would have been roasted, but it was cold and also very gamey. It didn't come with hoisin sauce or anything. The server was kind enough to take it away and off our bill. 

I hate to say this, but I don't know if we'll be back. The server was really nice and all, but IMO, I would rather go to Big Wong's for half the price."}
{"text":"Came here for the soup dumplings and was sorely disappointed. We also had fried rice, crispy chicken with garlic sauce and the beef roll which were all just mediocre. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Came here today for some quick Taiwanese tapas style food.  Their dishes are all $5 or under which is a steal! The quality of food is decent and the portions are similar to tapas size,  which is good for sharing.  We ordered a couple orders of the soup dumplings,  which was hit and miss as some had soup and others did not.  The oxtail soup was flavorful. It had more of a tomato style base to it. The spicy sausage and tawainese sausage were delicious.  The spicy one definitely had a kick to it. The beef roll was also delicious as it was cut into four pieces.  The chicken oil rice also had great flavor and a good sub from the regular rice."}
{"text":"First time at this place. 
Not your typical Chinese joint. 
To star of with, the decor is contemporary unlike most ethnic restaurants that are studded with native memorabilia. The layout is roomy albeit small. 
For those who like to imbibe, there is actually a full bar. 
Now to the food. The menu is about 10 pages and the choices are authentic Chinese. If you are a PF Chang kind of a person, you most likely need to stay away. 
The fish filet Szechuan style was exceptionally good. The dried tofu with green peppers was new to me but delicious. 
Service was prompt and friendly. 
A great find."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We went like 2 times in 3 days!!  

Food: We odered quite a few dishes and thought they were all yummylicious! The only item I didn't care for were their Pan Fried Dumplings.  I thought the skin on the dumplings were a bit thick; therefore taking away the taste. 

Service: Better than most Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants  

Summary:  I will be making this place my monthly family dinner spot!"}
{"text":"Traveling in Vegas and yelped liang's. Amazing Taiwanese food! Fried beef wrap and beef noodle soup are highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had Liang's Kitchen bookmarked for a while, and finally made it over to try it out. It's located in a standalone building with a realty agency next door. It was definitely a little more off the beaten path, but the parking situation is not as bad as a result.

The interior was smaller than I expected, but as others have mentioned, it is quite modern, clean, and contemporary. The many airplanes and Taiwanese flag caught my eye.

Although the cuisine listed in this Yelp listing is Taiwanese and Chinese, I would argue that Taiwanese food does not make up the majority of the menu offerings. While there are some Taiwanese staples, Liang's Kitchen serves up a lot of Sichuan dishes and a random assortment of Chinese dishes that probably can't be attributed to any particular region. The menu is extensive though, and the dishes are certainly authentic.

There were some simplified characters in the menu, and some of the servers and cooks were definitely mainland Chinese, but I'm sure at least one of the owners is Taiwanese, and the logo does tout \"Taiwanese flavors.\"

But I digress. The service was very friendly, certainly above average for a Chinese restaurant. Granted, all of my interactions with my waitress were in Mandarin.

I ended up getting two dishes I had never heard of before: ???? (a cold and slightly spicy appetizer dish mixture of bean curd, pig's ear, and sliced beef with tendon) and ??? (literally \"big mouth pastry,\" a flaky sesame seed pastry pocket stuffed with minced pork and scallions). The portions were fair for the price, but I spent almost $20 for the two dishes (though they did fill me up). Both were very tasty. The appetizer was a bit salty, but it was more tolerable paired with the pastry. The pastry would have even tastier sprinkled with a little white pepper, but the white pepper shaker on my table was empty and I was too lazy to ask for a new one.

Liang's Kitchen seems like a nice restaurant, and I will definitely return to try more off the menu!"}
{"text":"Wow the food was very good! Definitely great taste and a lot of varieties. We came across this place on the way back to LA, and I thought the menus looked very attractive. We came in, ordered the pork chop soup, sausage rice, Shanghai fried noodles, beef cold dish, and a kong POW cabbage-- everything was very yummy. And it only came out to be around $60, not bad at all."}
{"text":"Really good. Soup dumplings were super juicy. Dan-dan noodles had a great texture, much better than the overcooked noodles at most Chinese places.  We will definitely be back next time we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was better than their other locations when they first opened last year, but like most businesses, good never lasts too long. After the new year, prices went up by a lot and quality goes down drastically. I used to come here almost daily but since the change, my last experience here last week will be the last.  First of all, the dinning area has a BO now. I don't think they wipe down the tables and chairs thoroughly. Second, the chef forgets to put seasoning in the food. We had to send the food back to the kitchen. Third, they cut down on the quantity of food per order. Everything got smaller. Meat dishes have half the usual meat.  I know because I used to go there daily. Sad to say, when the food establishment don't care about the most important thing, the food, I have to take my business elsewhere. I still think it is a three star quality if they make improvements instead of letting it go down the drain."}
{"text":"We just happened to drive by and decided to try this place.  It's really hidden on Flamingo and Lindell.  It was very delicious!  From the photos on the wall, Miam-Fa Liang was in the Chinese and the United States Air Force.  He is the father of the owner.  There are WWII planes hanging from the ceiling, along with a couple of F-14 Tomcats, an F-4 Phantom, and an SR-71.  The waitress told us this is authentic Taiwanese style food."}
{"text":"Went here with my friend because he wanted me to try out some Taiwanese food! My first experience was decent and I think I'd come back here to try some different dishes.

We both shared this hot pocket looking dish that was stuffed with some herbs and I think ground beef. I didn't get to catch the name, but I'll upload a picture so y'all will know what I'm talking about. That would be a dish I'd order again because it was awesome in terms of having a crunchy shell and being filled with savory meat while also having that freshness factor with the herbs. For my personal dish I got the bean bean noodles which was okay. I felt like I was mainly just eating carbs and they could give a bit more sauce and meat! It was like eating a plate of spaghetti with one serving of marinara sauce lol. The flavor itself wasn't too bad, they just need to fix their sauce to noodles ratio.

Overall this place was decent. It's located in a small plaza so it can be easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. I will continue my search for Taiwanese places. If y'all have any recommendations send me a message!"}
{"text":"Earl was craving for homemade noodles so I yelped and found positive reviews for Liang's.  We dropped by on a Friday evening for dinner and there were only two other parties there...which made us hesitant on whether this will be a miss vs a hit.

We sat down at a table where I am facing the big screen that was showing Tawainese Karoke music videos while Earl sat facing the tv screen that was showing the basketball game.  Ambience: CHECK.

The staff handed us three types of menu, the food menu with some pictures without prices, the menu list with the price, and another beverage menu with the different smoothies, etc.  Earl and I chose the thin noodles with fried onions, topped with a fried egg, and also the beef tendon soup with the fat noodles.  The first was delicious.  It was simple, yet, so satisfying.  We got the essence of the homemade noodles.  The second was meh.  I had better.

We also got the green onion pancakes.  These were nicely fried, though, we couldn't eat too many for this can easily fill us up.

We enjoyed our food and the ambience, so we will be returning patrons."}
{"text":"Was going to order food for my coworkers and myself. Called them 3 times and didn't get an answer at all. Disappointed with service."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite Chinese restaurants in the area. Every time I come to visit Vegas, it's a must stop before heading home. Cozy little restaurant that recently moved from their old location and thank god it did. China mama is no match for Liang's Kitchen! 

The first thing you notice when you walk into the restaurant is a lot of the decor. There are model planes dangling from the ceiling. News articles and old China army uniforms on the walls, makes you feel like you're in a little part of history. Once we ordered, the food came out in a timely manner and the waiters/waitresses are all very attentive when it comes to service. It's family style so everything comes in large portions which was awesome because my family definitely had a lot of leftovers to take home! There was so much on our table, I don't think I could name them all but we had their cold noodles, scrambled eggs with shrimp, green beans, xiao long bao (juicy pork dumplings), green onion pancake, red bean friend pancake (SO GOOD. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE DESSERT), half chicken, fried rice, and so much more. 

All in all, everything had lots of flavor and I can't wait to come back for it. Price wise, everything is reasonably priced so that's a plus. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Zero stars. Unacceptable in every way. Please don't drink the Kool-Aid on this place, it's horrific. Sesame pork pocket. The food was not fresh. Pork was cold, definitely not fresh and the sesame pocket itself was burned. So, it's like they took pre-cooked ground pork out of the refrigerator and then burned the pocket in a sad attempt to make it seem just made and burned the pocket in the process. Green onion pancake had no flavor whatsoever unless you're a big fan of oily sticky grease and a chewy texture. The server took forever to take our order and then she was downright hostile about everything down to bringing our check. We were in awe of her terribly bad service. You actually have to go out of your way to be that bad. At first, we thought it might be because we aren't Chinese.  However, a Chinese family of six came in and they received the same non-existenst service. Ugh. Never again. So many choices in Chinatown - please don't waste your time on food and service this repulsive."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese restaurant in China town Las Vegas. Best food and value in Vegas. 
 I had beef rolls, pork lo mein with homemade noodles, green onion pancake, Chinese string beans, with pork chops and rice."}
{"text":"HATE   Server forgot to put order of spinach in.

DISLIKE   Appetizer of soup dumplings that were ordered before the entrees were brought AFTER all the other items. Some of the soup dumplings were dry inside. Decor of fighter jets on the ceiling didn't make sense.

LIKE   Sizzling black pepper beef.

LOVE   Nothing."}
{"text":"One of my go to Chinese restaurant s in town. Live the onion pancake and hand pulled noodles!"}
{"text":"Authentic and excellent flavor.  Ordered 4 dishes and they ate all good!   Great service too."}
{"text":"Might be our new go to spot for Chinese - my husband loved the chicken fried rice . Hot and sour soup is good and the small bowl feeds a family . Also got pork dumplings = delicious . Excellent service"}
{"text":"If there's anything consistent about this place, it's the inconsistency.

Stopped by after a hiatus of a couple months to find the menu has completely changed. Pretty much everything is $5 or less and it's mostly noodle-focused, with just a couple appetizer-type plates on offer.

Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the food. Pretty much everything we ordered was meh but what really bothered me was the awful beef roll - overcooked and tough. It's a shame as past iterations of this restaurant featured excellent versions of this quintessential Taiwanese dish.

Sadly, the service was inattentive too. May put this place on the skip list until the menu changes again (which, as history shows, may not take long at all!)"}
{"text":"*Edit* After I wrote this review, I turned in and went to bed.  I woke up at 3 am with TERRIBLE stomach cramps, and crawled to the bathroom where I proceeded to shit and vomit simultaneously, while crying.  Worst food poisoning ever.  I would give this restaurant negative stars if I could and I think the health inspector should shut them down.****

Let me start off by saying that I am Chinese.  Many times I read reviews that complain about poor service at Chinese restaurants and I usually write it off because I have a different expectation of service at Chinese restaurants than at Western ones.  

However, the horrible, terrible no good service here has managed to underwhelm even my super low standards for service at Chinese restaurants.  

We weren't greeted by anyone when we walked in.  After the lady waved us to the table, I had to wave to get her to bring us menus after waiting 5 mins. 

When we finally got a chance to order,  they were out. of. every. appetizer.  Literally every single one.  I tried to order a soy milk and when they said that was out,  I asked for a milk tea.  They didn't have that either.  

After we finished our noodles we asked about the 2 other dishes that we had ordered and wanted to cancel them as we had already finished our food. Suddenly they both appeared at once,  which leads me to believe they had been ready and just sitting out for a while. 

We did not have one single interaction with an employee without having to wave them down.  

The food was all under seasoned and needed salt, especially the onion oil noodles and the green onion pancake. 

This chain has restaurants that have closed all over LA so I was excited to find one here in Vegas, cuz I love the dry tomato pork noodle.  But sadly,  I can see why this chain isn't doing well,  and I cannot recommend it to anyone.  Unless you enjoy a terrible dining experience that will raise your blood pressure and test the depths of your patience, don't eat here."}
{"text":"Fried. Onion. Noodle. 
If you come here, you need to order this dish.
If you like eggs, add another over easy egg. 
If you like spicy, add some hot sauce.
Perfection. 
You are welcome! 

Other items that I would also recommend: 

A-choy - sauteed vegetables with garlic. Simple but tasty. 

Snow Vegetable with Pork Soup Noodle - Also simple, but great flavor. I especially like the fresh vegetables and green onion which adds freshness to the warm and comforting soup. 

I'll be back for perfection! ;)

Tip: Look for the massage place and you will find Liang's. There's three massage places in this back corner of the center... weird."}

First visit I got the Spicy Beef Stew Noodles,  delicious. Plenty of meat and the soup stayed hot through out my meal. I would recommend it, definitely not too spicy so you can add chilli sauce. 

Today I got the pork chop lunch box. It was average,  I had better else where. The pork portions was average as well and little rice. I would suggest getting an appetizer to go along w the lunchbox.

The environment and seating is good. Many TV screens as well as a small bar."}

{"text":"Came here with my in-laws (who are from Taiwan) and they enjoyed the food very much!   It was nice to get a selection of traditional Taiwanese dishes since we don't have any real great places back home.  The food was delicately seasoned and felt like home cooking.  

We had some cold appetizers- we had braised tofu and the sliced pigs ears.  It was nice to have the option to not have the pigs ears spicy.  We also had a crispy beef roll, Shangai style rice cakes, beef noodle soup, ong choy with garlic, and rice with pork sauce and chicken.  

Overall we left very full and very happy!"}
{"text":"Great food great services and great price 
My kids love this place !
My personal favorite is the beef noodle soup ."}
{"text":"We ordered:
Mixed Chinese appetizers with peanuts, thinly sliced tofu and pig's ears. They were not kidding when when they said its spicy (but in a good way). Not for everyone especially the pig's ears. Okay to try once. 

Beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles- broth has a hint of sweetness due to the sweet pickle. It's different but I'm willing to try it again in the future. 

Beef rolls- beef is thinly sliced and tender. Very good. 

Green onion pancake- crispy especially on the sides. We like it. 

I love the decor and the way are the round tables are separated by the circular privacy walls. Very chic. 

Overall, good food, fast service, reasonable price. Will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"My husband really loves this spot and I have to agree it's petty good Chinese take out. We've never eaten there. We had the beef roll which I e never seen before and I added a bit of siraicha sauce to and really enjoyed. Their wonton soup, shrimp fried rice and pepper steak were all pretty good and we will definitely be ordering again. The menu is very big so we hope to dine in next time so we can see what others are eating too!"}
{"text":"I was in heaven when I learned about the grand opening of this authentic Chinese restaurant. Not only it has a \"mom's kitchen\"  vibe, but also the wait staff are truly genuine .
So far we have been there a dozen times and every time we are pleasantly surprised with what we have ordered.  

This restaurant will be enjoyed by people who enjoy \"authentic\" Chinese cuisine experience and not \"Panda Express\" or \"PF Chang\" lovers. 

For starters. I would recommend their beef roll and beef wide noodle soup. Their cold sesame  noodle is also one of the must tries.  When in doubt, ask the waiters for recommendations."}
{"text":"To find this authentic gem in LV??  Unbelievable!!! Service is top notch as well. You want real Taiwanese food in the city that never sleeps? Look no further. Won't regret!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant again.  ordered fish fillet w/hot source  and twice cooked pork.  wow, they are as delicious as what you can get from nice restaurants in Taiwan.  Very reasonably priced.   Give it a try,  you won't regret.   This is the third time we visited this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the only place in Vegas where you will find delicious authentic asian food that isn't grossly overpriced! I've gone to several Chinese restaurants here in the search of eating food that tastes like home, and Liang's Kitchen is the closest thing to food in the San Gabriel Valley that I will ever taste here! Beef rolls are the best I have ever tasted here. The Beef Noodle Soup and Oxtail Noodles are perfection! You almost can't go wrong with anything here. 

The only con here is that some of the waitresses here have limited English, and service here is almost non-existent lol. Then again, it's a typical Chinese joint ~ just enjoy the delicious food and be happy."}
{"text":"BEST. BEEF. STEW. NOODLES.

The search is over. Liang's has, by far, the best beef stew noodles in town. I have tried various places, and nothing compares to this place. I was estatic when I found out it opened in Vegas after being a regular at the location in San Diego during my college days. My go-to meal is the beef stew noodles (#63) with the la pian/homemade noodles. The noodles are thicker than the regular ones and absolutely delcious. I like to add a little bit of spiciness to mine, as well. Pair the noodles with the green onion pancakes to dip in the broth, and you are golden. 

The service here is a lot better than other Chinese restaurants I've been to. The servers are kind and courteous. There is free wi-fi, and the password is on the front counter. Just a reminder that there is a $20 minimum for credit cards. Overall, definitely one of my favorite spots in Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS. We came on a Tuesday where unfortunately, the chefs were not in the kitchen so all that was available was noodles. Fortunately, their selection of noodles and buns were fantastic. Before we came we we're thinking \"who eats Chinese food at Vegas?\" Afterwards, we were speechless at how amazing the experience was. The owner of the chain was super nice and was really easy to talk to. Overall, a well deserved five star for a splendid dining experience."}
{"text":"The food here was poorly done compared to the Liang's Kitchen in California. The waitress messed up our noodle order. We ordered to have thin noodle, but it came out to be rice noodle. When we tell them about the order was wrong they smiled, said \"Ooh\" and walked away with no mean of changing or fixing the wrong order. The beef pancake came out cold and nasty taste. I would never come here again"}
{"text":"Just good quality Chinese food. Close to the strip, reasonable prices, extensive menu, nice simple atmosphere. If you are looking for good Chinese food to share with good company, look no further."}
{"text":"Servers are too busy with friends or behind the counter. I don't think they even know how many customers in the restaurant. I heard laughing and loud talking. Once friends left, whole place only hv noise from TV.

Pork chop lunch box was a joke. Less than half size, paper thin, very over fried and dry. This kind of pork chop good for kids meal. DONT EVEN TRY TO SALE IT.. What a disappointment.  I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Foodies good and fresh. Taiwanese flavors. Impressive menu. Location is slightly outside of china town. It worth a trip to hv great food."}
{"text":"Omg this place is soooooo goooood!!!! Must try the noodle with fried eggs. The Taiwanese sausage and stewed eggs it delicious as well. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Called over the phone to place a to go order and it was so frustrating!  The lady one the phone, 1st time, hung up on me when she told me to hold on.  I called back and tried to order the Minced Pork Sesame Pocket.  And she said there is no meat inside.  I asked her for the one that had the minced pork inside.  She kept going around and around with me saying you want order the pancake.  I said no, i want the sesame pocket with the pork inside, the meat!   She still didnt understand me.  And i finally told her nevermind.  I was on my way yo work.  Didn't want to deal with the aggravation.  

Please hire people that speak English!  Geez."}
{"text":"Ordered about nine different small dishes.  Everything tasted fresh and scratch made; I loved it.  A little pricey, but some of the best Taiwanese food I've ever had.  Will definitely stop here every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very nice staff! The soup dumplings are amazing especially with the chili sauce and black vinegar. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The foods were good up until this past Friday when we dropped in for dinner.  All the foods were off the usual taste and the portions were smaller for the prices they charged. Saw them bring out lots of  catering foods to be delivered. We always ordered the same foods every time we come in, so yes they were pretty consistent until that day.  We think our foods were prepared  by a different chef and the taste was less than impressive.  I will look for other restaurant to go in the future."}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant! Been here a couple times because I lived in Taiwan and I miss the food. I always try to stop by now that I don't live in Vegas . Excellent authentic dishes that are homemade and delicious. Dry beef noodle, octopus, gaobuli baozi was fresh and perfectly seasoned! Green onion pancake is just like my second home ! The chef saw I spoke Chinese and was generous enough to gift my entire table a huge bowl of shaved ice and came to explain to the rest of my family about Taiwanese cuisine and culture ! What a wonderful experience with some of the warmest, kindest and most welcoming people in the world. You just go and enjoy !!"}
{"text":"This is a one of nice Chinese restaurant in Vegas area. I have been here couple times and i had good experience so far.
My favorite dish is still the Chinese style beef burrito. So far I still like it up to my 2nd visit. 
Not all dishes in this place were that great but so far the beef burrito and the pickled tripe soup never let me down.
The service was good and attentive too. My friend forgot her sun glasses and the waitress even ran out to catch us to give back to her. I think it's a big plus to the service."}
{"text":"It was late Frifay night and we wanted soup but wanted to try something different. That's when I looked up Taiwanese on Yelp and Liangs seemed to be the obvious choice. We came in around 9 pm and it was dead. I wanted to try some of their famous hand pulled noodles but they were out of the wide noodles. Bummer. Regular noodles it is. We also ordered the beef roll. The broth itself didn't do anything for me. I did enjoy the texture of the noodles and you could tell they were freshly made but the beef was so tough and inedible. It almost didn't even seem like beef. The beef pancake was good but it needed something else to brighten up the flavor. Overall this meal was a huge letdown and I didn't even finish half my soup and I was starving. Liangs is definitely not for me."}
{"text":"A lot of Taiwanese comfort food on the menu. So far celery beef, shredded tofu with pork, basil chicken, pan fried pork buns, meat ball stewed in cabbage/mushroom (lions head).  Beef stew and dried noodle al dente (wide hand tossed noodle) Crispy chicken with Sichuan garlic sauce is basically breaded chicken fried steak, with garlic sauce with a hint of sweet sour. Despite the name Sichuan garlic sauce its not spicy at all. 

 All dishes are tasty, portions enough for two meals.  Complimentary hot tea are very tasty.  This is a great addition to our thriving Asian food scene.

Having been here over a dozen times, we have come to appreciate Taiwan's comfort food, or home cooking. Waitresses have warmed up and provide good service. Their doughy items, buns or pancakes, are very tasty. New favorite is Beef stew in wider dry noodle, al dente. Mix it up b4 eating, enjoy."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best chinese restaurant in Las Vegas.
And I've been in a lot of them!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best and most authentic Taiwanese restaurants in Las Vegas. It's a little hard to find (it shares a building with an insurance company), but just a little searching and you will find the most amazing food.

If you've been here maybe 5+ months ago, the food was maybe not so good, but they've recently switched chefs and boy oh boy is the food delicious.

When my dad and I go, we always order some cold dishes, especially the noodles. Every Tuesday is Noodle Day! The beef noodle soup is also quite good for those of you who know that Taiwan is famous for their beef noodle soup.

Their soup portions are also pretty large. I would say the small can feed about 2-4 people.

One day when we came we were quite lucky and they served us passionfruit juice and it was so good, but they don't do this every day, so don't expect it, but if you go and get some kind of juice when you sit down, it's quite delicious.

I always try to go here at least once when I'm in Las Vegas, and I hope you do too!"}
{"text":"Excellent Taiwanese food enjoyed by the whole family today! We were visiting Vegas from NY/NJ and were blessed to find this Restaurant. Their food is extremely authentic, flavorable. We ordered many dishes and everything was extremely good. We often eat in Flushing, NYC Chinatown and Chinese restaurants in Northern NJ. We found Liang's food better than all other places near us. We wish we can take their food back home... Winning dishes include eggplant with basil, spicy tofu with fish filet, some cold dishes and the sesame pockets with pork and scallions. We will definitely visit this place again if we are ever in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Best customer service ever and the food is to die for ...I love the soup dumplings and and the pork pockets!!!! Super bomb"}
{"text":"First time eating Taiwanese food and I may say... Their food is delicious  I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Super impressed with this place. Really good flavor and the portion sizes are huge!! The prices were higher than the average place but the size of your meal makes up for it. Service was great too! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant yesterday.
All I can say is I need this restaurant to open one in my city. The food were awesome for me and my husband loved it as well. I would recommend anyone to go there. Good food. Nice people and it is a clean restaurant. We loved everything we ordered."}
{"text":"Taiwanese franchises do it right. Liang Mama does it right too, for the most part. It's clean, stylish, and the service is good. 

Mom and I ordered appetizers: cucumber, tofu (hot and cold). The restaurant provided a small dish of spicy pickled vegetables. We also order garlic stir fried vegetables, beef noodle soup, and \"snow vegetable\" (mustard leaf) noodle soup with handmade noodles. I loved the texture of the noodles.

I ordered the beef scallion wrap for my better half to eat when we got home. He seemed happy!

I was pleased with everything but my mom's beef noodle soup, which was too sweet. The location is a little weird as well, but maybe it'll bring some life into the area. 

I will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Love this place but they took the amazing pork / egg-chive buns off the menu! I really hope it comes back. The hot and sour soup and noodles with scallions are always great."}
{"text":"Flavor is not there, the pictures look amazing but that's about it. I had the egg noodles with fried egg it was ok and super oily. My husband had the ox tail stew and it was so tough not only that but it was sweet. Not a good combination for stew. :(( super sad was really looking forward to this place after I saw the pictures."}
{"text":"Wow....really? The worst service ever. Typical Chinese service no body hosting no one says hi no one cooking. All microwaved foods. No answer for waiting nobody in here including customers. The worst FOBS in Vegas. Totally Fresh Off Boats service. Will not ever be back. Does not fit American Standards!"}
{"text":"If I can give negative stars, I would. 
Poor customer service even when I just tried to order over the phone. Very rude, sounded not friendly and got major attitude! Highly disappointed considering I actually like the one in California. 
If the staffs were not happy answering the phone, don't bother to even pick it up!
\"Minimum wait time is about 45 minutes because the chef is taking a break?!?!?!\"
Might as well just turn on your voicemail for incoming calls. Seriously.
Called the next day trying to order,
\"We don't accept to-go order now\" hang up on me.
How is that for a restaurant business??  I was amazed."}
{"text":"It was my first time there , because of     nearby Palm Casino.  I don't think it is that good and authentic  as Yelper mentioned.... very very disappointed, slow service, over priced, small portions of food. Overall I would probably go elsewhere for more variety in Chinese cuisine ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????Q???9?????????????????????????????????????..?????????????"}
{"text":"Good solid Chinese (Taiwanese) cuisine.  We ordered the fish head hot pot and it was filled with all kinds of tasty treats. The only item in the pot we did not care for was the tofu.  It was grey, spongy and bland.  We ended up picking it out of the pot.  The rest of the pot was delicious. It was more food than we expected. 

We also ordered the beef noodle soup which was fantastic and authentic. The noodles were made in house, the beef was tender and the broth was full of flavor.  

We stayed away from the specialty dishes on this trip but will definitely try the fried onion noodles and the green onion pancakes next time we visit.  

The decor is a bit odd with model airplanes hanging from the ceiling, these funky round booths that are bright red, Chinese videos playing on a huge screen and this funky bar filled with bottles.  Although it was odd, it was very clean and well kept.  

We were a bit annoyed that they charged us for white rice when we ordered three dishes with one of them being $30.00!   Who charges for rice when you are ordering multiple main dishes???

This place should be on your radar if you are looking for Taiwanese food.  Just be leery of ordering white rice with your dishes......,,"}
{"text":"Great Taiwanese restaurant. Excellent food, interesting decor and friendly service."}
{"text":"You might not notice it at first glance. They served us chicken and instead of providing actual meat they gave us bones. To top it off, it's not even regular thigh bone or wing...it's the NECK. The part that restaurant throws away. The part where the Chinese restaurants usually include if you order the whole chicken or a whole duck. Instead they pass this $h!t off to paying customers. This is effing BS. I hope nothing but for this place to shut down. I'd rather drive 4 hours to LA area and get some real food. I've been here one too many times and left disappointed. I was hoping their new menu would give be better but it's obvious they're complete idiots and shouldn't be running a restaurant. Never again!"}
{"text":"We got here around 2pm on Sunday but it was not busy. The staff was not welcoming when we walked in. There were 7 of us so we got to order different dishes.
For appetizers: 
- Honeycomb in spicy sauce and oil: was served cold. It was not fresh when tasted. 
- Mini dumplings in spicy sauce and oil: also served cold and the portion was pretty small.
- Xiao Long Bao was hot and yummy.
For main dishes:
- We tried Mongolian beef and crispy chicken in Sichuan sauce and they were good just on average. 
- Fish fillet with pickled mustard soup WAS A TURNDOWN! I tried this soup in a lot of Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants but this place, man, the soup was bland and tasteless. Fish fillet did not taste like fresh fishes. I barely finished my tiny soup bowl. 

Overall, the staff was inattentive. We asked for a cup of water and the server did not bring it out until 10mins after. Later when we asked for more water, it never came. I noticed that the servers were on their phones. The foods were pricey comparing to its small portion. I might come back just to try other dishes hopefully will get better service and foods."}
{"text":"I don't live here, but I visit my parents here often.  Before Liangs, I thought Vegas Chinese food was subpar.  I'm finally relieved Vegas has an authentic Taiwanese restaurant.  Everything is very good here; the cold dishes, beef noodles soup, tea duck, loofah, pork pockets, and tofu dishes."}
{"text":"Went here on two different occasions. 

Mainly came for their beef rolls and the onion pancakes. They're decent but nothing to be wowed at. 

Service was mediocre on the first visit but the second visit was just terrible, aha. Couldn't even verify correct order or not because they don't put table numbers on their order forms so there's nothing to reference to. (We had a discrepancy with something we ordered and they thought we ordered something else so we wanted order form to verify.)

Service is slow so you gotta wave your hands around to get ahold of someone. Seems to be the case whether they have a lot of customers or if we're the only ones. 

Found a piece of plastic in my soup with the seaweed. Sighs. And the seaweed soup seemed crunchy/had that sandy texture like I'm eating sand or something. My friend has already said she won't be coming back. 

Really wanted it to be better but yeah... First visit was definitely better than the second in terms of overall experience."}
{"text":"Been here twice and while the food may be good the service is not. The first trip they forgot one of the 3 items we ordered. The second time, they did not even let my husband order, even after we told the server he still needed to order. There were only two of us - it's not like they could have missed him"}
{"text":"The Soup Dumplings, the Pancake Wrapped stewed beef, the Pork Stuffed Pocket Bread and the potstickers we're out.of.this.world.
Also, the Dan Dan noodles we're excellent.
I'll even go so far as to say the soup dumplings are the best I have had on the West Coast.
The Winter Melon drink was great as well."}
{"text":"Considering there are Liang's Kitchens all over Los Angeles I was expecting a lot more from this one in Vegas. The pork chop over rice I ordered was magically delicious, the breaded pork chop was tasty and not overly breaded or greasy. The pickled veggies, soy sauce egg, and minced pork that came with it were perfect in every way. 

That's about where the fun ended. The fried onion noodles everyone raves about here was bland and boring. The dumplings we ordered I thought was a complete fail. The filling was so overpowered with white pepper that's pretty much all you could taste. Service was pretty poor considering we were 1 of 2 tables in the entire place for lunch. Drinks were never refilled and there fountain sodas tasted horrendous as they probably haven't cleaned out the lines in years or ever. This place is by no means terrible, just considering all the competition they're facing around I would just move on to somewhere else."}
{"text":"We ordered a zhajiangmian and a pickled vegetable noodle soup. I love myself a great zhajiangmian, so when the plate came out, we were disappointed with how little sauce we were given. Our waitress was nice about giving us a bowl of extra sauce for our noodles when we pointed it out. Aside from that, the zhajiangmian was delicious. Our pickled vegetable soup was a huge family sized bowl of yummy goodness. I actually liked the soup more than the zhajiangmian, but just by a little. For both dishes, it came out to be $17. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Not all that long ago this restaurant used to be called Hot Feel, but it shuttered its doors after not even a year in business serving delicious lamb skewers and spicy boiled crawfish.  So when I heard my friend said that there is a new restaurant there with a logo of a lady as part of the signage, my first thought was that it could be China Mama's second location.  But obviously that's not the correct guess.  

Liang's Kitchen ???? (literal translation is Liang Mama's House), with the logo of the founder/matriarch of the restaurant incorporated into the signage (now in her 80s), is a Taiwanese comfort food restaurant chain from California and New York.  With locations in many of the Cali cities that I have previously lived or worked at before my move to Sin City.  So it was a surprise and reality check to see some of the cities listed (Cupertino, Fremont, Milpitas).  But I have been out here a relatively long time and those locations could have opened after I had already settled here.

The interior of this Liang's Kitchen still retained the majority of the interior design concepts custom built for the previous restaurant entity. albeit with small but noticeable additions.  The inclusion and prominent display of vintage Flying Tigers* aviator jackets (very very cool and most people will likely not know anything about its history) high up on the wall with lighting to draw the attention of anyone bothering to quickly survey the restaurant.  Plus there are WWII and Vietnam War era model fighter planes delicately hung from the ceiling in sortie formation (neato!).  

* 1st American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force in 1941-1942, nicknamed the Flying Tigers, was composed of pilots from the United States Army Air Corps, Navy, and Marine Corps. (Copy & Paste excerpt from Wiki)  

The menu is extensive and following recent Chinese restaurant menu design practices, especially from abroad, looks like a sales catalog with professionally shoot images of some of the menu items, with alternating pages of straight up advertising.  It looks good, but it also has one very annoying attribute or lack thereof, which is the absence of any menu prices.  [Insert comment about if you have to ask about the price, you can't afford it. -Smirk face-]  I know from the restauranteur's perspective it makes sense and saves money in the long run, since they don't have to reprint the menu or have those tacky stickers every time there is a revision to menu pricing.  There is a separate menu sheet that does have the menu items and pricing, but no pictures.  So if you have the patience for it, you can practice cross referencing the main menu with the supplemental menu and other printouts.  Happy. Happy. Joy. Joy!

Food wise, I really liked the Beef and Tendon Soup Noodle that I ordered.  It is definitely ranked in the top two on my list for this item in Las Vegas.  The noodles are the thick chewy handmade variety from Northern China. The beef tendon was cooked long enough so that it is soft and very enjoyable to eat.  The broth is flavorful without being greasy.  The Lamb skewers was good, but I thought it was a bit pricey.  Their lunch box items has a good variety of pickled vegetables and 1 entire soy sauced egg along with rice and whatever protein you selected (I ordered the Taiwanese fried port cutlet for my friend, she ate everything and liked it except for the pork - too greasy).

Service was good.  However, being a new restaurant with new staff, they are still not completely familiar with the pages and pages of menu items.  But as far as refilling drinks, being friendly, it was good.

I will definitely be back to explore more of their menu.  However, considering the dreary weather, I may not get past their noodles section until late February.

4 stars! And best of luck to the latest Taiwanese restaurant to open in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"In our recent mini vacation at Vegas, we dined at Liang's Kitchen twice.  We both agree this Taiwanese/Chinese restaurant is THE BEST.  Not \"one of the best\" but THE BEST.

We tried the house special Onion Oil Chicken and the Steamed Fish Filet in the first visit.  Both are so good that we decided to come back again the next day, before departing Vegas.  The 2nd time we ordered the Spicy Jalapeño Beef, Mapo Tofu and Muster Green with Edamame Beans and Bean Curd.  All 3 dishes are made to perfection, again!

We then decided to order some snacks for take-out as we will get home by dinner time and these snacks will be perfect for dinner.  We ordered the Beef Wrap, Pork Pocket and Chive Pocket; needlessly to say we had a wonderful light dinner and breakfast the next morning.

My strong recommendation for Vegas visitors (or residents) - when you are sick and tired of the casino buffet like we are, give Liang's Kitchen a try, you will like it and include it on your to do list for Vegas, next to Bellagio's music fountain.

Oh, did I mention that the price is reasonable compared to the Strip price, and the parking is free?"}
{"text":"Came here because I was craving their beef roll. The restaurant is basically by itself in its own plaza so it's hard to miss. It has this Chinese feel to it when you walk in. 

We waited for a couple minutes to be seated but there literally was no one eating inside the establishment. We were sat in a booth and asked if we would like water or tea. We choose tea and it was really good. Before ordering I got up to use their restroom and it was really hot inside there. Not sure if the AC reaches all the way back there.

My husband and I shared a beef roll, soup dumplings, and beef noodle soup. Everything was very delicious. I really like how they make their own noodles. It made the dish even better. I mixed the chili sauce they provided on the table with the sauce they gave for the soup dumplings. It gave it a bit more flavor and was very satisfying. 

Overall, service was okay. I had to ask for water a few times before our server actually came and gave it to us. The food was excellent. The left over beef roll was still good the next day."}
