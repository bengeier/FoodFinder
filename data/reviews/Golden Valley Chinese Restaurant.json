{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Everything from how family oriented it is to the quick and easy combos they offer. Nothing makes it feel more authentic than the homey atmosphere and friendly workers that have been around forever. Tom, the owner, always remembers everyone's names and picks up conversations right where you left off.   Pricing is extremely affordable and the food is delicious! I love the Dan Dan noodles the most. Such wonderful flavors and always have enough for the next day.   The only con I've experienced is the lack of service sometimes. However, keep in mind, traditional Asian food service is extremely casual and they try not to bother you while you eat.   If you're looking for a quick, inexpensive bite of Chinese, I'd stop by!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Golden Valley since I was a kid, and it's always been fantastic.  The food is great, extra cheap, and can be cooked just how you want it.  I love their hot and sour soup and lemon chicken especially.  Your water glass is never empty! Service is good.  Norah is right, Tom is the shiznit.  Fantastically nice service, and it's genuine.  if you go there more than a couple of times, it's a good chance he will remember you.  On busy nights he isn't so much waiting tables as running around talking with friends.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious orange chicken! Super happy workers. And quiet. Just my boyfriend and I and an elderly couple were the only ones in there. Perfect"}
{"text":"This place is awesome big portions for a great price. Tom the owner is a very down to earth person tries to get to know every one of his customers as best as he can I've been going there for quite a while and always treated with respect I went there when I was sick to get a bowl of egg soup and he gave it to me for free great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I have lived in the neighborhood behind Golden valley for over 10 years. This place is amazing. The owner Tom is possible the nicest person ever. Lunch specials are a great value. I would recommend the orange chicken."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food place I have eaten at. Most places really aren't that great or are really bland but not this place. Tom is always so friendly and smiling when you come in the door, the other lady is nice as well but I don't see her too much. I very much recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The Kung Pao Chicken and the Hot & Sour soup were amazing! Tom the owner and chef came to our table to be sure we were enjoying the food. Don't be fooled by the shopping center location - I give the food and service 5 stars."}
{"text":"Our most favorite restaurant! The service is amazing and the food is even better!! You get so much food for what you pay for. We get the orange beef and sesame chicken every time! And my husband loves the egg drop soup!"}
{"text":"Golden Valley has been a family favorite for over 15 years. Tommy is amazing, he remembers repeat customers. Each time we come in my daughter is asked if she still would like unsweetened iced tea and if my sister would like low sodium soy sauce. The food, *sigh*. I swear I dream about it.. don't judge! Super good, super fast and plenty of food for 2 meals on each plate. There is a reason that we have been visiting Golden Valley for 15 years... it's just THAT good."}
{"text":"Because of my love for the Kung Pao Chicken I have returned many times to try everything else that I usually love. I have come back with my boyfriend, Sister and one of my good friends. The only time I sat down and ate was with my friend and we experienced a small wait. I am totally ok with that! It is good new for me, means they're doing well and I can continue to eat there for a long time to come. My friend and I ordered A LOT of food to share between just the two of us. We got a Pu Pu Platter which I haven't had in years and it made me so stupidly happy. Everything on it was awesome. We ordered Beef and Broccoli, Sesame Chicken, Chicken Lo Mein and my Kung Pao. It was all delicious! The Sesame chicken was the one I cared for the least. I had never had lo mein before but the noddles were cooked so perfectly, the veggies had just the right amount of firmness, and the sauce was flavorful.  My Sister and I ordered the Egg Fu Young with low expectations. We care for it in a very specific way and we are usually let down. Not here. Golden Valley is one of the only places we can find Egg Fu Young the way we like. Give it a try. As always, the Kung Pao Chicken is life and you need to let it into yours."}
{"text":"I hardly ever take time to do a review but feel this needs to be said. I ordered chicken teriyaki for lunch take out today.  I have cooked long enough to recognize the taste of yesterdays chicken out of the fridge. I can confidently say this dish was made with  pre-cooked gristly dark meat cuts that were honestly really disgusting. Was expecting something a bit better after reading these great reviews. This is just a review for this dish. Maybe other dishes are better. I could never go back . Just my experience. ...would not suggest the chicken teriyaki. .."}
{"text":"I've been here three times so far.   Everything I've had has been fresh and delicious,  and the service is friendly and quick. My wife commented that the sweet and sour pork was a lot more pork and less breading than other places we've frequented.   This is now our favorite Chinese place in Gilbert/Mesa!"}
{"text":"Flat out best damn chineese food I've ever had. Quality and quantity. The owners are awesome and take care of us like we were family.  Food is always top notch!!!"}
{"text":"great food and service! a little pricey because you have to order some thing separately but other than that great for next day left overs too! CHECK OUT THE MENU'S THEY HAVE HILARIOUS TYPOS :)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, still good portions at great prices. Tom is a good friend with the family."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch!  Terrific specials.  The value for the money is terrific with most of the specials at $5.95.  My daughter loves the Shrimp and Lobster sauce which is slightly higher at $7.25, but it usually gives her leftovers for at least one more meal."}
{"text":"ive been coming here for 11 years and never been to a different place! the best food ever! tom is a great guy and always very pleased with his service"}
{"text":"The previous reviews are all accurate, especially about the egg roll. After so many years of panda express I almost felt guilty with the amount of food for the price. If you are looking for old school Chinese food, this is  the place."}
{"text":"It was good but not as good as the other reviews made it seem. They did not even have the hot chili paste, its like eating mexican with no salsas. They are friendly and the food is ok. Nothing really to rave about. And I did ordered 4 different plates and the chow mein."}
{"text":"Huge portions and friendly staff! Will definitely  come back the cashew chicken was the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and we always walk away with a TON of leftovers!! Super nice people there too. My boyfriends family have been going there for over 20 years and introduced me to it. Great price for the portions as well."}
{"text":"first visit great atmosphere friendly service. the food was great and fare portions. waiter was on point kept our glasses filled and asked if we needed anything. this is a keeper."}
{"text":"Went to the Golden Valley Chinese restaurant unexpectedly and never been there before, but my brother-in-law recommended it so highly I couldn't pass it up. We had an assortment or a variety of dishes ordered on the lunch menu and the prices were awesome the portions were really really big and the service was great. I will highly recommend this Chinese cuisine anybody who likes good service good food good prices"}
{"text":"Great food that shows up hot and fast. Waitress friendly and knows when to ask if you need anything and when you just want to enjoy your meal. Price is incredibly fair for the portions and quality."}
{"text":"This is probably not my favorite Chinese restaurant but wow they are cheap and the service is GREAT! The food is good and I always walk out with a smile. I will keep coming back for more :)"}
{"text":"The Food & Service is exceptional.  Beyond excellent ?. The Portions were a healthy size, Enough for a couple of meals. The prices were extremely reasonable. The staff is Friendly, Courteous & Effecient?Clean, Quiet with background music setting the ambiance of the Orient. We will Return."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Golden Valley for about 13 years now, Tom knows us all by name. There has never been a day where I have felt the food was horrible, the service is always right on par and I cant even gush about just how much I love their food. I was in the hospital once and after lung surgery I asked my family to bring me some of their hot and sour soup. My go to though is the Teriyaki Chicken, its a little to sweet for some people but I love it. Every time I get a cold (or I'm really hungover) I will go to Golden Valley just for a giant bowl of soup for a really good price."}
{"text":"Complain, I dare you. Dine in or takeout, you get superior product for a more than competitive rate. This has been our go to Chinese place for a year now, and they deserve all your business. Fantastic food with great service and at amazing prices. Don't let the location fool you, you're a moron if you don't help me keep this place open."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant since we moved to Mesa about 6 months ago.  I'm still not sure if this one fits the bill.  We ordered vegetable lo mein, kung pao beef, sweet and sour pork, a pu pu platter for two, and an egg drop soup.  We kind of go all out when we do Chinese so we have an extra meal's worth.  Plus, it's hard to tell how hungry the kids will be.  Take out service was extremely fast, about 15 minutes.       The pluses: First off, no MSG! Woot!  The lo mein was delicious.  A lot of places over cook their veggies, and these were done perfectly.  Not super mushy, and they actually tasted fresh!  Also, it wasn't greasy as many places tend to make it.  I actually felt like I was eating something healthy!  And, though the kung pao wasn't like any I'd ever had before (sweet then hot), I actually liked it more the further I got into my carton.        The Yucky side:  The sweet and sour was awful!  The sauce was so red, I think it was straight red #40 and sugar.  No MSG, but overload on the red dye...I'll pass.  And I think I've been spoiled, but I can no longer do the soggy sweet and sour.  After having Happy Food's version that is so crispy...I can never go back!  The pu pu platter looked like it had been leftover from someone else's order.  Old, cold...so very sad looking.  My husband actually ate it, but the beef on a stick looked well past it's prime, and tasted horrific!  The egg rolls were quite small, but not terrible, and the soup was edible, but I couldn't get past the smell to eat it (pregnant nose will do that to you sometimes!)  My husband ate the soup too, but said it was kind of bland.        It's kind of in the air; we will try it again, perhaps for sit down and see how it goes.  I think it may be all in what you order..."}
{"text":"Very nice friendly service. Food very good and prices really reasonable. Big portions"}
{"text":"Have lived in the valley for 45 years, and this restaurant is a GEM! Awesome on value and quality. BIG helpings, SCRUMPTIOUS  food and personal service, in a nice family setting.  I can easily see why folks have gone there for 10 years and still love it."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch or dinner. My family and I have been going to this restaurant for over 15 years. It's a great place to go you're treated like family the prices are reasonable the portions are large Tom and Lisa are so friendly !!! The eggrolls are the best I've ever had. The orange chicken is amazing. Everything on the menu is great"}
{"text":"Great food & wonderful staff! We've been going here for over 20 years.  Never more than once a month, yet we're always recognized and treated like family. The environment is \"cozy old style\" and we love it."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for Yelp I'd probably overlook this place.  I had the cashew chicken for lunch as part of their lunch specials. Very large portion. I wasn't a big fan of their brown rice though.  Tasted a little pasty as if it had been sitting too long."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today for lunch.  It was OK. Not spectacular. We had the chicken chow mein lunch special. Prices are good.  I found it odd that this particular lunch special comes with a side of egg foo yung.  I'd prefer almost anything but that - considering the egg foo yung wasn't at all like others I've had. But an egg roll, chicken wing or finger or boneless ribs make much better side items. And the amount of rice you get was pitiful!  One small scoop the size of an ice cream scoop.  Rice is the filler - there should have been more of it.  The chow Mein tasted ok - it wasn't bad or anything.  We've just had better."}
{"text":"Surprisingly not bad...and super cheap for the portion size and service. I liked that it wasn't too greasy. Recommend the vegetarian options (soup with tofu was clean and bright tasting and the mushroom/tofu/chestnuts dish was tasty as well. The standards like General Tso's and the Peppered Beef were also good."}
{"text":"The food was no bueno, and I'm a little terrified that the only two diners robbed the place after I left. Very nice staff...and the prepackaged fortune cookie was tasty!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is filthy and disgusting this place should be shut down! Im shocked that  Nobody has left reviews about the filthy place are you people really that blind!. I guess it's because the food is cheap. Well people need to think about the dirt and cockaroaches their food is probably getting cooked with. The server was a old guy he was rude since we stopped in. He tells me the soup has chicken and shrimp he brings me a soup with pork I told him and he gets mad he grabs the bowl of boiling hot soup out of my hand and nearly spilled it on the table and my hands in front of me. The dishes are disgusting the glass cups had lipstick and dirty build up on it. They use black filthy rags to wipe the table it disgusted me. We got treated like crap since the minute we walked in for no reason."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I am picky about Chinese food, and the food I received here was delicious and quick. The servers were extremely polite and friendly. I felt welcomed from the moment I walked in. I will definitely return next time I am in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Chinese food is an individual thing; what one person likes another doesn't.  I ordered take out for the first time from Golden Valley last evening.  It was just OK.  Their fried rice had peas and carrots which I hate...I had looked at the pictures of their food on Yelp and it didn't look like it had them....I would have asked for it without if I had known...my fault.     The sweet and sour chicken was pretty bland and there was very little sauce on it.  The breading was mushy but that may be because it sat in the container for a while before we ate it.  The bean sprouts and vegetables in the chow mien were limp and soggy...again that may be because it sat in the carton for 30 min on the way home.    The restaurant was packed and lots of on duty police officers were eating there so it must be very popular.  I can only go by what I like and this didn't merit a return for me."}
{"text":"This place might looked closed because they have their blinds shut and the door is covered but they might open. The plaze where they are located is pretty much deserted after 6pm.  Beef and broccoli had great flavor but barely any beef I ordered it with no carrots. So it was more like water chestnuts and mushrooms with broccoli in a beef broth. The fried chicken wings were over fried and they gave me all flats. I'm a drumstick chick! The fried wonton were good exactly how I expected. Nothing like New York's. What I can say though their BBQ sliced pork was on point! Serving sizes were pretty hefty as well."}
{"text":"Totally recommend...food was good and service was even better. Friendly, fast and clean atmosphere. Lots of food for your buck!!!"}
{"text":"Extreamly rude workers. This was our 2nd trip to this location. The first time we came here our only complaint was that the restaurant was filthy. Everything was dirty, from the door at the entrance to the floor, plates, utensils, cup, ect. It's almost like they don't clean at all and aren't even trying to hide it. We wouldn't have came here again if we had remembered how dirty this place was. That's what I get for not leaving a review after our first visit. This time we sat down and got two really dirty looking cups with water and my girl was nice and just asked for two more, not mentioning how dirty the first two were. The waiter took our order and had a attitude the whole time we were ordering. He finally brought my girls soup and when we complained about there being pork in the soup after he swore there would only be shrimp and chicken, he got really upset and snatched the soup away from in front of my girl almost spilling it on her and our 6 month old baby. After he did that we just got up and left. This place needs to be shut down for way too many reasons. I have never been to a restaurant that was so dirty or so horrible at customer service. Avoid this place. DO NOT GO HERE! DIRTY AND DISRESPECTFUL SERVERS!"}
{"text":"love this place . Tommy is awesome, treats you like family. the food is amazingly good and so much in a serving. lunch is a super deal,  soup,  entree, rice and egg roll,  for like six bucks.  and there was enough for lunch at work the next day too!"}
{"text":"Somewhat surprised by this place. Placed to go order over the phone and food was ready in 10-15 mins. General location is left to be desirable-- run down strip mall that seems like a ghost town. But food was ok for a local Chinese restaurant. Not spectacular by any means but you get what you pay for. Host was friendly and welcomed us to the neighborhood as we mentioned we had just moved to the area."}
{"text":"Good enough place.  About what you'd expect on the inside.  Easy to find, easy parking.  Fast with the refills.  The Kung Pao is pretty good.  They use a selection of vegetables that *snap* when you bite into them which is nice, makes it taste fresh.  Sometimes stir fry kills the texture of the veggies but they do a good job here.  Very reasonably priced.  You can get the lunch special which is more than enough for 1 and have some left over, then be out the door for a total of $10 including tax and tip."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Mesa. They give you pretty good sized dishes. The owner is really nice and always attentive. We haven't been there in a while but he still remembers our family! The Orange Beef is my favorite but everything on their menu is really well done!"}
{"text":"Starting off the customer service was above what most restaurants give you. They continually refill your drinks, and stop by to make sure everything is good. The portions they give for dinner is huuuuge and I have a full meal left after I was done eating. The only reason why I put 4 stars and not 5 is because the orange chicken tasted more like sweet n sour than orange chicken. Other than that a great place and will return."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place after car hunting.  First time here.  It was 12:30 pm on a Friday and the place was busy.  But only stood around waiting on a booth for 5 minutes.  Unable to get into one side of the booth so had to both sit on the other side.  Only was a 15 minute wait before we got our food.  Big amount of food, I wasn't able to eat it all and that is different for me, because most of the time I finish my meal and end up eating what is left of my wife's.  Never had to ask the waiter to fill my water glass.  He was the only one working the tables and was amazing.  Jogging around taking care of everyone."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy. Hot and sour soup was perfect, crab puffs very delish. The main dishes were fantastic and generous. I left very full, with leftovers and a new fave Chinese stop. The portions are huge and the owner's are super nice and remember you!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so fantastic!  You go once and te owner remembers your name!  We have tried almost everything on the menu and it's all so incredible!  My favorites are the orange chicken and the lemon chicken. Their crab wontons are penomonal and the wonton soup in awesome. The egg drop soup is the best I've had. They give you enough food to have leftovers for several meals.  We live an hour and a half from here now that we just moved and still go at least once a month- usually more.  SO worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality, superb service ~ we love Golden Valley! Lunches are a value, dinner is a delicious! We have celebrated Anniversaries, big birthday parties, wedding catering & take out! You are not a stranger at Golden Valley long - Tom the owner remembers everyone's names!  Excellent Hot & Sour Soup, Egg Drop, Egg Rolls, Crab Puffs. - Kung Pow, Satey Beef, Tangerine Beef, House Special Chicken !  A good Chinese Restaurant has good soups & crispy egg rolls - your mouth loves to begin the meal with these!  I could go on & on!  Golden Valley features large portions & excellent prices ! Best Chinese Food in the East Valley & in the Metropolitan Phoenix Area!  I am an AZ native - do yourself a favor & eat at Golden Valley!"}
{"text":"I normally never do a review but this place is a true exception!  The best Chinese food around! Definitely worth the occasional drive from Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Very good bang for your buck. The food comes in very large portions for the price you pay and is not cheap in quality. I would highly recommend coming here over the other more expensive foo foo Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent prices. Friendly service, and large portions. This may be a little place and not to fancy but excellent food. I love the garlic chicken"}
{"text":"Being from Northern California I have a completely different standard for Chinese food than is usually present in Arizona. Most of the people I grew up with of Chinese extraction were were either from Taishan or Guangdong - it's really hard to find sizzling rice soup in the Valley of the Sun but Golden Valley does it well. The service is great, the food is better. It is a little whole in the wall in a strip mall so don't expect the nicest decor even if it is clean and everything is in decent shape."}
{"text":"Best place in Arizona to get good Chinese Food price's are great and portions are large. Don't miss out on good food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the whole world.  The owner Tom is truly a great friend of me and my family.  We have been going there since they opened in 1998.   The food is great and the prices are very affordable, especially for the amount of food you receive.  This one place where the odds slim that you will ever reach the half way point of your glass before they refill it.    I've have taken loads of friends and colleagues here and have yet to hear a bad comment.  I notice during the lunch hours that Golden Valley is a hit for folks who are taking lunch breaks with their co-workers.  I have also seen plenty of families gather to celebrate a special occasions.  This a simply a wonderful family oriented restaurant with a good personality and warm atmosphere.  And we all lived happily ever after..... THE END! :-) ha ha"}
{"text":"I have to say that for the money this may be the best bang for your buck! A huge plate of QUALITY Chinese food for under $6.00??? That's exactly what it is. I recommend this place to everyone I know and every time they say the same thing..... Simply the best!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch about 12:30 on a Saturday ordered generals chicken with white meat and they served me food Cooked and leftover from the day before breading was super soggy and the chicken meat was dry and hard    I don't recommend this place and I will never return"}
{"text":"Well well well.  Where to start?  This is one of those places I'd like to give an extra half star to but my experience doesn't deserve a four.  Ambiance is horrible and a bit depressing, not to mention they were listening to Christian radio over very bad scratchy speakers.   YIKES!   Ok after reading what I just wrote 3 sounds generous!   The food. .. .. I had the chow mein and egg foo  yung combo.  Huge portions for a 7 dollar lunch. Definitely two meals worth.  That alone I'm sure brings the boys to the yard!  Food was good but not mind blowing. My friend wouldn't even try my EFY because the gravy was the color of an egg yolk.  Which was slightly off putting but I still enjoyed it.  My chow mein had lots of veggies and was satisfactory. He had the lemon chicken which consisted of all white meat chicken fritters with a sweet, very yellow sauce.  He thought it was dry, as did I.    Yeah I might come here again if I'm in the hood.  Wouldn't go out of my way. But I'd be willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"Overall a very good Chinese restaurant.  The Orange chicken, Beef broccoli and Triple delight a very good.  The Teriyaki chicken was just ok and the egg roll was good, but not great. Very reasonably priced very good food."}
{"text":"Fabulous food! Never disappointed! Amazing people, your glass is never empty and your plate is loaded with freshly prepared deliciousness! Family owned - a diamond!"}
{"text":"Hello all.....I did in fact visit this establishment after reading others reviews on yelp, I honestly cannot call myself a fan after one visit.... Sorry I was not impressed.  We should not base our opinions (at least I don't) off of quantity vs quality or simple good tasting food. I will admit that this establishment serves very large portions.....but does it really mean anything if the taste or the quality of ingredients don't hit the mark?  Honestly I was not pleased with the items that I ordered, the quality just was not there, I can't honestly give this establishment a recommendation to go visit at this point, but I have to be fair, I am going to visit one more time only based on the positive reviews that they have currently.  WE WILL SEE????  I did return and I am a Happy Individual, the servings are just incredible. It is surly geared for a Family on a budget. Give it a try."}
{"text":"If you go for lunch you will be happy, fresh food due to the rotation of people around that time and not a long wait. The staff may not be the most friendly people to non-white customers and being white It's easy notice the difference in effort and patience. Most likely why the last post did not have a good experience and I personally have talked to the manager about what I had noticed, not sure if they understood what i was talking about. Still worth a try maybe they were just having a bad day or a bad situation in the past. Still worth a try!!!"}
{"text":"Onions all throughout the egg drop soup...never ate egg drop soup full of onions. Fried shrimp was all batter. Got my order to go but restaurant was very quiet and hardly any patrons"}
{"text":"Took an hour amd 15 mims to deliver. Food was decent tho. They said it would be 45 mins"}
{"text":"So good and leftovers for days!  Owners are super nice and added a Chinese Calendar to our \"to go\" order.   We will be back for more soon, thanks for the good experience and great food!"}
{"text":"Shady looking location usually means a delicious meal and this was true once again... I had the sesame seed chicken and the terrayaki beef for my main dish... appetizers consisted of egg drop soup, egg roll and fried wontons-the fried wontons were the only thing that wasn't that good... service was impeccable and the food came out of the kitchen fast as you can say kitty cat.... would recommend"}
{"text":"Some of the best places can be found in some of the oddest locations, in this case a very nondescript strip mall on Baseline and Extension in Mesa. I live on baseline and didn't know this parking lot existed until I searched out this place.  According to the menu the owner was actually a chef in China. Okay I'm sold.  Portions are overly large, the food is good, but here's the kicker...their lunch specials are served 7 days a week. That means you can go in and get a $5.95 lunch special with a side of pork fried rice, an egg roll and soup any day of the week.   Food is quality and good Chinese cuisine is hard to find in the Valley. As a native NYer, I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Me and my husband have been going here for over a year. Never disappoints. Portions are large. One plate feeds both of us. Very delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible pre-cooked frozen food. Not sure why all the good reviews but there was absolutely nothing good about this places food. Nothing was fresh not even the vegetables.  Had the #J for lunch, Husband had the orange chicken with egg roll and i ordered the dumplings for appetizer. EVERYTHING came out with in 10 minutes of ordering. That right there was a huge red flag to me. Try as we might we just could not force ourselves to eat more then a few bites of anything we ordered. Also asked for hot mustard but we never got it. Do not waste your time or money at this place."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was little! It's a hole in the wall! We don't even call it golden valley, we call it toms (the owner) he's so amazing! He knows us by name and knows our drinks! He doesn't even have to ask! Always start of with pot stickers and won ton soup! Orange chicken, lo mien, fried rice, beef broccoli...I've been here 13 times since 2015...we don't ever go to any other Chinese place"}
{"text":"The food is just bland. The service is good and prices are right but there are better place."}
{"text":"This is a old favorite! I have been coming here since I was in High School and I am never disappointed. Fried rice and the fan favorite Orange Chicken are amazing"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to Golden Valley a few months ago, and I visit here as much as I can even though I live nearly 35 mins away. After living in Asia for two years, this might be as good as it gets back in the US in regards to Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome you will deff get your money's worth. The orange chicken was perfect well balanced I've had it in other places and the taste was overwellming perfect balance here. Lo-meine was great enough food for 2 people. Will deff come back."}
{"text":"A big surprise when we opened the door to a nicely decorated place. Service was good and friendly. Food came promptly. Stopped in on Good Friday heading to Mass and split shrimp fried rice with my wife. Very tasty. The addition of bean sprouts was a great taste and texture addition. Sorry we didn't know about this place sooner. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here again recently with family, was again amazing! So worth the price!  No noise for one was awesome  Nice quiet meal with family. :)"}
{"text":"This place has rubber beef, dark meat chicken that's mostly fat and crab puffs with 1/2 tsp of cream cheese inside a giant fried wonton. When i showed the waitress the crab puff and asked for some with some filling actually inside she just said \"only very little\" and walked away. She didn't care. If you want great Chinese food go to \"Golden Gate\" on 101 and baseline. Real beef, lean dark meat chicken and the best crab puffs you'll ever have. Yes the portions are large but quality is poor. Golden gate have great size portions with high quality."}
{"text":"We tried takeout for the first time here tonight. We have had a lot of trouble finding a good Chinese place out here in AZ, but this place is pretty top notch. Loved the egg rolls especially"}
{"text":"This is a little gem of a restaurant. The service is very personal and fast. The remember and recognize their customers. Their food is excellent and the portions are large. The pricing is very reasonable. Try it and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"I ordered the sweet and sour shrimp and egg foo young and was dissapointed with the lack of flavor, the dry texture and the overall quality. I have good interactions with an employee there, so I added a star.  The egg foo young was a dry, flavorless, seemingly premade patty. The sauce was alright, the chicken and veggies were good. Part of my disappointment is that I prefer a freshly made patty with the veggies and meat mixed in and a slightly thinner sauce.  The sweet and sour shrimp wasn't high in flavor and was dry and could have used some more sauce.  I believe I was dissapointed with the food the last time I ordered there as well, so I'm going to have to scratch this restaurant off of my list. It seems a lot of people like this place, so maybe it's just that my preferences don't mesh with this restaurant's output."}
{"text":"Five stars again and always!!    My husband and I have come here to eat lunch a few times during the week, and man is this place good!  Huge portions, and the owner is just such a sweetheart guy.  Can't wait to come back!!  :-)"}
{"text":"Been going here for YEARS!!! Best and most affordable Chinese in town!! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Great food & service at reasonable rates.   Portions are very generous.  Food came hot fast & plentiful."}
{"text":"Crab puffs had barely any filling, but they were pretty cheap.  My fiancé did not like his orange chicken.  My lemon chicken was ok and the egg drop soup was yummy.  Overall it was just ok."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and the food is amazing but the best part about golden valley is the owner Tommie. Moat people call this place tommies and he is always in a good mood. Everyone who comes in knows his name and he knows theirs. The food is constantly good and i always love a hole in the wall"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, and have never been disappointed. I've been able to meet and get to know Tom, the waiter, and he is an awesome person to talk with. The food is good and reasonable for the price. I would recommend this place to any of my friends - it's a valley hit!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered orange chicken, kung pao beef, and crab rangoons. My girlfriend \"orange chicken\" didn't even taste like orange chicken, more like sweet and sour chicken. The breading on the orange chicken was soggy and looked undercooked  My kung pao beef was a bit better but barely had any veggies and peanuts. The crab rangoons barely had any filling in it. I definitely won't be back here again."}
{"text":"We like this place. The decor is as hideous as any other Chinese restaurant we've been to, but it's very clean and the owner and wait staff are wonderful. Very good prices, food is good with generous portions."}
{"text":"I've been going to this little gem for years and it is consistently delicious.  I normally get a couple meals to go with egg rolls and barbeque pork slices which I call my grocery shopping for the week.  It reheats beautifully in the microwave and I don't have to cook dinner for 3 or 4 days.  The owner Tommy is always smiling and treats all his customers like personal treasures.  I've probably had over 100 meals from this place and would recommend it to anyone wanting good Chinese food.  Years ago I used to frequent The Golden Canyon which was owned by Tommy's aunt Susie.  I loved that place until she sold it to a new owner and the quality went down.  So, I have about a 30 year history with this family and their foods.  30 years of not being disappointed speaks volumes of their quality.  After seeing the review from clueless, left coast Samantha of Portland whining and possibly flat out lying about this little family run business, I felt it necessary to respond.  Here's an idea Samantha!  How about you go back to your left leaning, faculty lounge mentality, socialist loving state of Oregon and quit taking up space in our little restaurants?  We do not need you."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times and the food is always hot and fresh, services is also great.  The waitstaff keeps your glass full.  Will continue to come here.  Very family friendly."}
{"text":"Ridiculously delicious!  I haven't had Chinese food this good in the valley for a very long time. I'd given up on the category in lieu of much tastier Thai options, but Golden Valley has put Chinese takeout back on my menu. I've eaten here twice now for lunch and each time I've been blown away. On my first trip I tried the Yu Shing beef, which was a risky option since I haven't really liked it at other restaurants but felt like something spicy and usually this dish includes eggplant (at least where I've tried it). This is the best version of this dish I have ever tasted. They don't use eggplant but I quickly got over it as the beef was perfect, not chewy and full of flavor. The sauce wasn't gummy and the vegetables were nice and crisp (one of the factors that has drawn me to Thai cuisine as I hate mushy vegetables). I also chose the egg drop soup and it was very good, perhaps not the best I've ever had but certainly near the top. Eggrolls are also one of my \"Litmus Foods\" that I use to judge the quality of a restaurant, and the eggroll that came with my lunch special was one of the better eggrolls I've had in awhile (I think Jack-in-the-Box eggrolls are among the best around if that gives you a baseline on my tastes). The eggrolls at Golden Valley have a good selection of vegetables with a slightly sweet flavor that I really enjoy.  On my second trip I ordered the Mongolian BBQ Beef lunch special on takeout. Takeout doesn't include the soup but that's pretty common among oriental restaurants that offer a lunch special so I won't dock them points for that. I ordered a tea to go and the to-go cup they gave me was a good 32oz size. The Mongolian Beef was so good it was ridiculous. I almost think my tongue was dreaming and reporting something unreal because that's how good this Mongolian Beef was. THE BEST Mongolian Beef I've ever had and that includes PF Chang's. The onions were crispy and the beef full of flavor.  All the lunch menus comes with pork fried rice which is pretty average but I appreciated it better than plain white rice. It was good enough to mix in with the meals and sauces. It's the kind of fried rice you'd get on a side though, so I won't judge it as their entree version.  Value is certainly the most surprising aspect of Golden Valley. Their lunch portions are huge. I usually skip the lunch menu because the portions are too small to do me justice but in this case they provide plenty of food for the money. If you sit down, order anything off the lunch menu that doesn't include seafood and a drink, the whole experience will set you back $7.75 (incl tax) plus tip. For that you get a cup of soup, an entree, fried rice and an eggroll. As an example of the portion size, when I ordered to go, the Mongolian Beef completely filled the entree section of the standard size styrofoam clamshell. Needless to say: I am full! All for about the same price as a large Double Quarter Pounder combo at McDonald's and with about ten times the flavor.  The atmosphere is comfortable. It's clean, modest, and the staff is friendly and attentive. I was really surprised given the location and outward appearance of the building. It's really hit or miss when you step into a strip-mall restaurant what you're going to get but this location is a testament to hole-in-the-wall dining. Simply a pleasure. I think I've found my go-to place for a quick lunch to go."}
{"text":"The food it's really good and they give huge portions will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Just found this place last week and my husband and I have already been twice. They have the BEST fried rice we have ever had and their food has been great both times! Definitely try the sweet and sour chicken and fried rice. We always carry out and it's fast and easy but they are always super friendly in there! I'm so happy I found this place on yelp!"}
{"text":"This place is so good it's Mesa hidden treasure . The last time I was here was like back in..07 I think..and came back and the food is still awesome!. The only thing is the service that they gave us was not to good. She was probably having a bad day but when your serving customers you should try to but all your stuff aside and try to give the best service you can. Other than that this place is still very good I will come back again for sure. Won't let it last to long to come back"}
{"text":"I have been going to Golden Valley for 10 years and (admittedly) I have brought quite a string of boyfriends through there!  Tom (the owner) is always friendly, ready to meet someone new, and impresses EVERYONE by remembering what they order to drink, what level of spice they like, and what they typically order.    Their waitstaff is always outstanding.  If you show up 15 minutes 'til close you are still more than welcome to dine-in.  The portion sizes are phenomenal, the prices are great, and this is THE best eggroll you will ever have - hands down."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am very picky when it comes to dining out. Chinese food is about the only dining experience I ever look forward to going to, so I'm always looking for the next best place to get Chinese. Let me also say that I frequented a Chinese restaurant back in Pennsylvania that was absolutely the best, so my expectations are high and I've been trying to find one that can maybe please me here in Arizona. Golden Valley comes pretty damn close to being as good as my favorite place back home.  Don't let the looks fool you, I went with a friend and its in a tiny run down strip mall and you can barely tell its open. As the old saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover. Once we got in, it kind of smells and looks like a pizza shop, but all the Chinese authenticies your used to are present here. This restaurant is actually run by Asian people as well, as one of my pet peeves is when you go to a Chinese restaurant that's basically an American restaurant that just serves poor interpretations of Chinese good.   At Golden Valley, its very authentic.  Let me avoid rambling though and get to the point.  Food is priced great, with entrees ranging from $7-$9.  You get an absolute ton of food as well, and while I'm accustomed to getting enough for two meals, they give you a plate so big and so overflowing its enough for 3 FULL meals and perhaps even 4 smaller ones.  It's definitely a great value.  The staff is extremely friendly and courteous.  The owner Tom is very friendly, and I have even had some great conversations with him when the restaurant is less busy and I was eating by myself.  Even when I had not visited the restaurant in two months, Tom remembered my name, and recalled stuff we talked about 2 months ago.  It was a very nice hospitable feeling.  The food comes fast too. Most entrees took only 5-10 minutes to come out.  The food itself also tastes pretty damn good, and I would definitely go back again. Not the best by far, but certainly somewhere I would like to go again. I give this review 4 of 5 stars because everything was perfect except the meat used in the dishes. I got a chicken dish, and my friend a beef dish, and the meat in both our dishes was definitely \"mystery meat\" The meat was a little fattier than I expected. and had tiny bits of cartilage in it.  The meal would have been next to perfect if I wasn't swallowing or having to spit out crunchy cartilage or fat deposits every few bites or so.    I can't speak for the beef, but the chicken was obviously just very poor thigh, wing, and leg meat, and very fatty ones at that.  I will go back though as while not the best, it was a good meal, and hopefully they will get better quality meat.  Food and service is still so good though that despite this, it's worth checking this place out."}
{"text":"Tommy is really nice and the food is awesome! The service is amazing as well. The portions are big so you can feed two or take it as left over for lunch the next day! Amazing place to eat!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something different and local so we found this place on Yelp! Based on the reviews we figured it would be a decent place. We arrived and there was no one in the entire place except staff. We were immediately seated and placed our drink orders. My friend ordered the sweet n sour chicken with house fried rice. I ordered the lemon chicken with chicken fried rice. The sweet n sour chicken was very dry. Next to none on the sweet n sour sauce. Both servings of the rice were bland with no flavor. The Lemon chicken was ok but not the greatest. My friend was highly disappointed in the food, taste and quality. The portion sizes are rather big which is nice if you're happy with the food. My chicken fried rice had no flavor as well. Definitely not impressed. The service was so so. Not very friendly staff. But hey now I know and will not be coming back. Try at your own taste as you may enjoy it. I was not too happy with it myself."}
{"text":"I got the shrimp Kung Pao shrimp and it was some of the best I've ever had -just the perfect heat level and combo of crispy vegetables. We will be come back here real soon!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese food here. The owners are real sweet and the portion size is huge. Great for lunch too! Love there walnut shrimp"}
{"text":"Drove out of my way to pick up some dinner and there was a sign in the door saying they went out of business"}
{"text":"I eat here at the least once a week! I love it the food is always hot off wok and the service is friendly. The food is delious btw also. I recommend pick up and dine in."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've ever had. The service is over the top. Food comes to the table fast and cooked to perfection. Best experience at a restaurant ever. The type of small business you want in your community. I will be a customer for the rest of my life. Oh I almost forgot. The crab puffs are insane. It's the one thing my wife and I can't share. Mmmm"}
{"text":"Went in on Sunday with the family, hidden jewel for sure. I ordered the Yu Shing Beef, OMG amazing!! My wife ordered the sweet and sour chicken, which was very good. I felt very good after eating here. Would definitely recommend this place to my friends. Keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese joint. Food is good and plentiful here. Tom is the owner. Very funny guy. I like all the food here. Great variety. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Read a couple of reviews about this place and since i didn't live to far from the place, I decided to check it out.   My first impression was meeting the nice waiter and i think the owner.  Very polite and and happy.  Most places usually just sit you down and walk away.  But this guy was wanting to know how the day went and always had conversation.  When he gave me the menu, I was delighted to see a open type letter inside the menu that introduced the owner and chef and his experience.   I tried the chicken chow mein and some tea.  I don't know the traditional way of a good chow mein but from where i come from, the place that i grew up eating chow mein used lots and lots of bean sprouts.  I've been to many asian eateries and found only one in the valley that compares to what i grew up eating.  I must say the the chow mein here is pretty comparible to what i am used to!!  Great flavor and huge portion.  I am going to be visiting this place more often.  Thanks for the great food!!"}
{"text":"The search for good Chinese food in Phoenix continues.by Valley of the Sun standards, this place stands out. For those from New York LA or San Francisco, not so much. Large portions and good service. The lobster sauce and hot and sour soup were hits. The egg fu yong we would pass on next time. Stuck in a strip mall, this place makes the grade as a fine local Chinese worth visiting when you're in the mood for sweet and sour."}
{"text":"One of my favorite new spots for Chinese take out style food. I've only been during lunch to take advantage of their lunch specials which are some of the best value meals I've found in a long time. Choosing items from the lunch specials comes with soup, an egg roll, and fried rice with portion large enough to have leftovers. The food comes out hot and well prepared and the staff are super friendly and provide a local mom and pop feel. The dining area is pretty typical of other Chinese restaurants, which may be the only downside I've seen so far. The full menu has lots of choices for just about any craving you might have and if the portions and preparation are anything like the lunch menu, then you'll have a tasty dinner with leftovers for a late night snack later. I'm really pulling for continued success and hope the quality doesn't suffer like it seems to at other spots over time. Will return again."}
{"text":"Eck!!!!!! I recently moved here from Seattle WA. I am a Chef with 30 years experience and I can tell what is scratch made, fresh and pre frozen. I have relied on Yelp to help me find some hidden treasures and new favorites. This place had high marks so we decided to try it out. Highly disappointing and a waste of money! We ordered the Lemon chicken which in the description stated it was made with chefs special recipe. It tasted like canned lemon pie filling. The fried rice was dry and awful. The egg roll was soggy and disgusting. I suspect , in fact I know it was a frozen product. From the other reviews I believe Arizonians have been deprived of quality Chinese cuisine and have very low standards. Don't go here with any high expectations."}
{"text":"Found this place using Yelp. Very pleased with this find. Excellent service and food. Portions are huge-enough for 2 leftover meals. Chicken Lo Mein was perfect , full of fresh veggies and chicken. Orange chicken was tart and sweet. Very pleased with our visit."}
{"text":"A quiet Chinese Resturant that is hidden. Food has good flavors and price point is very reasonable.   We enjoy their walnut shrimp, orange beef, Sa-te Beef and Kung pao chicken on this visit.   The chicken in the kung pao dish is heavy w water chestnuts, celery and bell peppers. The size of the chicken slices were smaller than desired. But the flavor is good. I can cook more chicken to the size I prefer and add it to the dish.   The pieces of shrimp for the Walnut Shrimp dish are a very nice size. The sauce is a nice texture that is laid over the shrimp.   This is a nice place to come to with good dishes."}
{"text":"Ugh, my first night in mesa I went and picked this food up. I had no internet and no food in my house  so I had to use proximity as my only judgment of where to eat. There were a lot of people eating here, so that made me feel hopeful for a minute. When I got the food home it was some of the worst food I've had in a long time. I ordered chicken chow mein and it came with those noodles from a bag. The crispy ones used to dip in sweet sauce, not pan fried noodles. Now that may have been my mistake, but what wasn't was that the chicken that was supposed to go over top was poor quality and had this weird white gooey tasteless 'sauce' on it. I couldn't eat it. My boyfriend got sweet and sour chicken which also was poor quality and was not good. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were up in Mesa for a swim event and after surveying our group- the consensus was that we wanted Chinese food.   Trusting my good pal Yelp so show us the way, we agreed to go to Golden Valley Chinese Restaurant for four reasons.   1. It had 4 stars.  2.  The pictures looked delicious.   3. It was within our budget.  4. It was located close to where we were.   Upon arriving into the shopping center, we noticed that here were several cars outside. Always a good sign. It was about 6:45 or so, on a Saturday evening. We entered and were immediately greeted by a friendly employee and were seated in a corner. The six of us fit into the booth comfortably and were asked what drinks we wanted.   The menu has many options but we agreed on egg drop soup, vegetable lo mein, and vegetable fried rice. The other members in our party ordered orange chicken, sesame chicken, and vegetable lo mein. When the food came, we were taken back by how big the portions were. The value is excellent. We fed three people off our two entrees and soup and had plenty to take back with us. In addition, the food was delicious.   I would definitely recommend Golden Valley Chinese Restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a Chinese restaurant as good as they have back at home in New England for 7 years here in AZ.... Well I found it. It is Golden Valley. I have never thrown away leftover Chinese food till I got to AZ... Well I got the pu pu platter, bbq pork, egg and vegetable fried rice and chicken chow mien. Huge portions so we, My wife, daughter, and me, Had supper then breakfast and then lunch of these leftovers, and guess what? I had supper again. All from this one order. And all for only $29. I instantly called them with praise and added them to contacts. Thank you Golden Valley, I feel at home again......"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. I have never found a spot that I love more for Chinese food! This place is truly a hidden gem(: The atmosphere is always fun and the service is impeccable. Also, the walnut shrimp is a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food. The personalized experience makes you feel more like family than a customer. Has been one of my favorite places to eat for many years, Tom is the best host!"}
{"text":"Ordered house fried rice and sweet and sour chicken.  No flavor on house fried rice. Beef was bad rice was dry.  Just terrible. Sweet and sour chicken was a shamble also.  Parts were cold.  So bad we refused to take anything home. Other meals at table were orange chicken and chicken fried rice.  They didn't eat much of theirs either and took nothing home.  Will never return"}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I was privileged to dine in when my family relocated here. It was delicious then and continues to be.  Hefty portions always"}
