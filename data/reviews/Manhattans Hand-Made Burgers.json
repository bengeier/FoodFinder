{"text":"Reviewed during: Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 1 / 5 Cooking speed: 1 / 5 Food Quality: 3.5 / 5 Food Quantity: 4 / 5 Price: 3 / 5 (Lunch Special is $9 only) Cleanness: N/A  Repeat: NO  We decided to try it out on Fri lunch time, since it's in a food count, the line was LONG...... Their biggest problem they had 2 deep fryers but only 1 grill surface, so only 1 deep fryer is barely in use when the grill was full. So the fries are cold by the time the burger is ready. The toppings are fresh and there are many selections. But the burger patty is bland! Did they forget to put in salt and pepper? I'm afraid the topping is better than the burger!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for burgers in the PATH,  you're not really going to get many good choices. Your options won't drift far from the Wendy's and the McDonald's...at least that's what I thought before coming to Manhattan's. There is pretty much always a long line up here whenever I come,  and for good reason. Breakfast platters? Check. Gourmet burgers the size of my head? Check. Salads and Poutine? Check. Pretty much a one stop shop for all your gourmet diner eats. Luckily, ordering is as quick as any other foodcourt establishment, and their prices arent outrageous for what you get.  I had the Green Monster Burger: thick beef patty cooked on a grill, avocado, bacon, and other fresh veggies, all on a fresh baked burger bun. The portions were so gigantic I could barely finish it! Needless to say I had no regrets... other than having a food coma after, that is!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Big, awesome burgers, at pretty reasonable prices given the sheer mass of food you get. Try the Smokey Jack."}
{"text":"Impressive service.Most of the time I get breakfast, but finally decided to try their Lunch Special. Glad I did that, as it was just right portion of meat(chicken) served with nice choice of veggies. Certainly something I would recommend during the summer months."}
{"text":"Best of the PATH burgers.   I tried the Green Monster with fresh cut fries.  The burger had a lot of flavour and toppings, I did not have to add any extra toppings, it was messy but delicious.  It's not the best burger I've tried in Toronto but it is rather best in the PATH for take-away"}
{"text":"It's fast food, but slightly different from what offered in the rest of the path. The staff are mostly friendly and the food is cooked in front of you. They have lots of options, but at the end of the day its not the best burger you'll find in the city."}
{"text":"I should have gone to Wendy's.  Not sure what these great reviews are about - I went at about 12:45pm and there was no line up.  I ordered the Green Monster - my patty was already cooked and just thrown on the grill to warm up, cheese wasn't melted, bacon wasn't crisp and fresh, and the burger itself wasn't any bigger than any other burger you can find elsewhere downtown.  Just the burger without a combo cost me $9.06.  I think that was the worst burger for $9 I've ever had."}
{"text":"10 of us ate here last Friday March 6 and it was excellent !  I have eaten at Manhattan's twice before and will definitely be going back again soon !!!  Fresh, made to order, and delicious !!!"}
{"text":"I tried their green burger; It was good but nothing out of the world. It simply tastes like a home burger."}
{"text":"Breakfast options are varied but the customer service is abysmal. There have been times where I have had to wait several minutes at the cash register before being acknowledged. I understand that it can get busy but how difficult is it to simply acknowledge paying customers??"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the PATH, in my very honest opinion. Don't get scared by their giant portions on the menu - ask for anything you want and they'll customize it.   Avocado and egg on rye! It doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"I got the peppercorn ranch combo with fries at the Bay-Adelaide location. Two people ended up making my burger. The second person decided to leave out some of the ingredients - a delicious strip of bacon and an onion ring - off my burger.  The left over bacon was put into a tray of already cooked bacon, which to me, seems like poor technique if they're going to recook the already cooked bacon for the next person in line. Who knows what she did with the onion ring, but I guess she rather throw it away than give it to me. The patty was left on for too long, I noticed this as I waited, making the burger dry and tasteless. The fries were bad as well - overcooked, dry and not flaky-soft in the middle. The seasoning salt for the fries was good at first, but the cook added a little too much and in the end they were too salty. If they are hand cut as they claim, they are most likely frozen and fried after.  Either that, or they just can't cook fries.  Another thing I noticed, the first person pulled out a tray of (pre?)cooked patties and proceeded to recook one for the next order.  i know it was already somewhat cooked because it wasn't pink, but already brown.  Again, poor technique.  For the price, ($12.90) I probably won't take the gamble to see if they'll get it right the next time. It's too bad because this place looked promising and their burger creations sound delicious."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times, and their burgers and fries are sooo good. I ordered the green Monster burger, which is super tasty. They give you lots of fries and the burgers are large. I once ordered the poutine with beef, and that was not the best...but for sure, the burgers are delicious. I found them to be cooked perfectly, and they pile on the toppings. One downside is they are not open weekends, as I would love to bring my boyfriend to try one of their burgers, but so far have only gone during lunch hour at work."}
{"text":"Went during lunch time and it was really busy but the line does move fast. The burger patties are fresh warm and delicious. Kind of pricey but well worth it for a food court burger joint"}
{"text":"Probably the best burger joint in the PATH, aside from Big Smokes which is a bit further at the Eaton Centre.  Their burgers are pricier as well but made with lots of toppings so quantity is great and taste is good, just can be a bit of a mess.  What I highly recommend are their poutines. They are huge! That can be a meal in itself.  Tried their breakfast a few times and they are a good choice aside from Tim Hortons and Extreme Pita which are the only other morning choices at Bay Adelaide Centre.  One star deducted because they should lower their burger prices and I will visit more often."}
{"text":"when I made my original review, I only had the burgers, which weren't really a standout. but since then I've found myself returning for the other items on their menu. For breakfast, they make a mean breakfast sandwich, and for lunch, the lunch boxes are a really good \"healthy\" option. so, the burgers are still status quo, but the other things on the menu are the standout items in my opinion."}
{"text":"I found myself walking through the Path the other day and I stumbled upon this eatery, and it's not too often you see an unknown hamburger joint, so I figured I had to give it a try.  They've got a pretty extensive menu, but I opted for the Big Texan (sauteed mushrooms & onions, crisp bacon, cheddar cheese, and hickory-smoked BBQ sauce). After placing my order, I looked over at the grill and noticed that there was already a fully-cooked burger sitting there. I thought to myself, there's no way they're gonna use that patty for mine.  They used that patty.  I braced myself for the worst and took my burger back to one of the many tables in the food court. As you might've guess from the list of toppings, the Big Texan is an exceedingly messy affair and I was ultimately happy that I remembered to grab a fork before sitting down. The plentiful toppings, which are all quite tasty, prove effective at masking the dry patty, and I did, as a result, enjoy the hamburger more than I thought I would. It just would've been nice if the meat had been cooked to order."}
{"text":"Little bit on the pricey side but that is to be expected. I've had the green monster as every one has recommended it and it was really good. The sweet potato fries are a great compliment to your meal. You can really taste the freshness of the burger as they cook it in front of you. Not my first choice for a burger fix but overall very good!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken breast sandwich with avocado. Maybe the biggest, tastiest, messiest sandwich in the core. The burgers are ok but this sandwich is worth a second round. No need for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"My co-workers have been raving about this place for the past couple months, so I had to check it out for myself with them. We went at 11:30am to beat the crowd. There was no line up, however the service was kind of slow.   I ordered the green monster (ripe avocado, crispy bacon, cheddar cheese, roasted garlic and chili aioli) and added lettuce, tomato, pickles and hot peppers on a whole wheat bun. I had a drink and onion rings on the side. This meal was kind of on the pricier side because that came up to about $15.   The bun itself was not that great because it broke apart really easily as you were eating the burger. The burger itself was extremely delicious...the cheese and the bacon was just dripping with grease which I absolutely love (the greasier the better right?). The onion rings were the best part of the whole meal, they were battered to perfection and they were extremely crispy & delicious.  Once noon hit, the food court was really packed, so if your thinking of eating here, I would advise to come a bit earlier to beat the rush.   Overall, I would definitely come back to order the onion rings."}
{"text":"Service speed is pretty slow considering it's supposed to be fast food in a food court. I came at around 2-3pm so there was no line, but still had to wait around 5 minutes. Nut maybe it's because it was off peak times and so they had to make it after I ordered AND I was thinking it's probably a good thing because they're preparing it in front of me :)  While they're grilling the patty you get the option to add any veggies you like on the burger as well as any additional sauces. ^_^ the burger was delicious!!!!! It definitely gets 5/5! And the fries were great and crispy too! 5/5 for fries!  I feel like the pictures I took don't exactly do the burger justice since it is a lot bigger and more filling than it looks. And it also tastes a lot better than it looks!  P.s they also have a huge ketchup dispenser and big heinz ketchup bags! This makes a ketchup lover like me happy hahah"}
{"text":"Must try: Green Monster Burger  I delight in simple things and this food court treasure made my day. I can say confidently I had my best burger experience here, compared to some of the more prestigious joints, like the works or five guys or burger priest.   I got the Green Monster on sesame buns, which contained some of my favourite things, like avocado, bacon, cheese, and spicy smoky sauce. I also added in my own lettuce and tomato too and left it at that. It was amazing, the patty was tender and well seasoned, right density, right texture, right size! The buns were soft and buttery and there was a perfect ratio of bun to meat. I had no complaints. I finished every single bite of my humongous burger.   I have also tried their sweet potato fries and onion rings before, and while a little pricey, oh so delicious!  Although I think some time during the afternoon, my heart almost gave in... worth it.  WYWH"}
{"text":"Went with the Green Monster burger with fries and it was surprisingly better than I expected. Customer Service was fast and efficient but not necessarily friendly but I'm fine.   Burger is pretty big with a juicy pattie.Tasty! Lots of ingredients. Fries were good. Price-tag is about right.  Solid option in the food court."}
