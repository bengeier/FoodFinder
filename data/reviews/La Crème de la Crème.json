{"text":"Went with a party of 8, ordered the special, a chicken pot pie.  Delightful little atmosphere, beer on tap - even microbrews, which it was too early in the day to try.  The pot pie was pretty good (7/10).  I'd go again if in the area."}
{"text":"I discovered this place last year wandering around in Old Montreal. It seemed cute and cozy, and very reasonably priced. I've been here twice so far, and each experience was the same: more than reasonable portions of delicious food. First time was for brunch (4/11), second for dinner (2/12).

The brunch option came with many things.. scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries, baked beans, bread, an assortment of fresh fruit (including pineapple, kiwi, watermelon and blackberries- swoon!) with my choice of juice AND coffee or tea. Everything was cooked well, delicious and satisfying. When ordering tea, you receive a carafe of hot water with your cup, along with your choice of teas from a box they bring right to the table.

My more current dinner stop was with the boy. I went with the table d'hôte option, while he ordered à la carte. My menu included soup, entree, and dessert plus hot beverage for 16$. I chose the vegetable cream soup, which was a lot like split pea. The soup was average, but did the job of warming me up from being outside in the snowy weather all afternoon. For entrees, I had the chicken pot pie and M tried the croque-monsieur. Both were delicious and came with generous side salads. The crust on my pot pie was flaky and buttery, and the filling was by no means overseasoned. I'm not normally a ham person, but the bite of M's sandwich also tasted delicious. For dessert, my menu included a triple chocolate cake, with tea. Again- cup, carafe and the large box of teas. M ordered a chocolate mousse cake which was rich without being overindulgent.

The best part about this place is the atmosphere. While small and cozy, I didn't feel cramped. I have never felt rushed, and the service was attentive and polite. I will definitely be coming back on future trips to Montreal."}
{"text":"Philippe the cheval carriage homme recommended this place.  He was spot on, a big thumbs up. French onion soupe is da bomb.  Warm mulled wine avec sucre lined glass, yum!  Jambon pate is a prosciutto on roids, awesome.  Even the cafe latte was exceptional.  Very reasonably priced. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Lovely brunch spot inside an historically-styled pub.

Like a lot of places in Montreal, the atmosphere was excellent and there was a much appreciated air of excitement within the restaurant. Depending on where you sit, you'll either be overlooking the lakeside or hearing all the hustle and bustle of the windy streets of the vibrant old town. 

The service was good, prices were perfectly reasonable for the area, and portions were colossal!

I had the croque monsieur and the baguette it came on was crispy, warm and delightfully fresh. The ham and cheese was loaded on in generous amounts and the simplicity and freshness in the ingredients just hit the spot.

There's nothing fancy here, but sometimes that's exactly the kind of food you need in an area such as this. I completely disagree with those who say this place is a tourist trap. To me, it was the opposite, quick service with fresh ingredients, simple recipes and no fuss.. 

Missing it already. There's nowhere like this in Toronto, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Went with five people for dinner, and have gone several times before for drinks and a light meal. Meat pie was great; good local fare.  Good place to get a pitcher of hard cider, sit outside, and people-watch. Atmosphere - bistro - very charming. Service quick and cheerful."}
{"text":"We came upon this place while walking along the historic area.  Super cute French appeal. The outdoor patio was perfect for the nice sunny day.  Service was super friendly as well.
  I ordered a cheese plate and it was amazing, having 3 different cheeses alone with hot fresh bread.  I got to enjoy 2 different French wines both tasted great and the pours were large."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try the food. Was seated at a table and then zero acknowledgement from the staff and we waited a good 10 minutes. Shame, we were excited about the food."}
{"text":"Situé dans le vieux Montréal, ce bar est parfait pour son patio. Commandez une bonne assiette de charcuterie et une bière et profitez du calme du quartier. 


Located in the old Montreal, this bar is perfect for its patio. Order a good charcuterie plate and a beer and enjoy the peace and quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast because of the nice outdoor seating area.  Not exactly in the heart of Old Town, but definitely within walking distance.  Good quiet place to enjoy a meal.  Our waitress was friendly.  Everything we ordered was good.  Nothing special to mention."}
{"text":"This place is across the street the water at old port. We came to watch the soccer game ( has many televisions throughout restaurant) and had some lunch. The food was great (tuna sandwich and chicken pot pie). All the sandwiches are served on baguettes which I loved. Great place to stop at for food and drinks. Only reason I didn't give it 4 stars was the service was not so friendly"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and great place to hang out at for a few brews. We stopped here and relaxed for a few hours and it was great. People walking by while we enjoyed our seleves and get to experience montreal a different way. Really recommend if you want to hang out side and chill!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a great find in many ways. The small plates are very tasty. But the best part was befriending the manager, Marie-Claude. She have us a lot of great information (like where to find the Montreal
 Jazz Festival venues. )"}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I went in the front door, and was yelled at for trying to use the restroom before I ordered - so I left.  A couple of days later I unknowingly sat at outdoor tables for the same restaurant and got a salad which was basically lettuce with about half a pound of cheese on it.  Yuck.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"We got in for breakfast & brunch just because it is too cold outside. The lunch menus has very limited choices. The food is so so average for the price. It looks very normal. The service is good though but I would rather save my stomach for nicer food in other restaurants."}
{"text":"Mulled wine on a freezing New Years Weekend. 

When it comes to what I picture about Old Montreal, this bar is it. Cozy nook made of stone, warm conversation, warn well menus where you can tell the most popular dishes. After freezing in -23C weather, we popped in here to get warm and found the Crème de le Crème of old-school bars. 

We had 3 rounds of their incredible Mulled Wine, served in glass mugs and filled with citrus notes and warm. We decided to take the last round with a slice of their triple chocolate cake, which was perfectly light and fluffy. 

This place was a perfect contrast to the aggressive winter outside."}
{"text":"We stopped here for drinks to escape one of the hottest days we can remember. My mojito was cold, minty and refreshing. It wasn't so strong I couldn't continue my stroll through Old Montreal, but it was reasonably generous with the pour. My boyfriend had one of their speciality coffee drinks, I forget which, but I think it had brandy in it. He seemed to enjoy it a lot. The wait staff was staff was pleasant. They were a bit on the slow side, but it was really a miserably hot day.  
The tables outside are quite nice, but a little too close together.
The menu is also a little on the small side. We stopped only for drinks and found it was adequate  but nothing super impressive. I'd go back though."}
{"text":"Small cozy cafe. Great food, coffees and cocktails! The desserts are really good too, try the mango mousse. Service is a. It slow."}
{"text":"Really cute place in the old town.  It's small and unassuming, and I loved it.  It's like stepping downstairs, back in time and into someone's cellar.  I had a Brazilian coffee, perfect.  The bartenders were very nice, too.  I came back with a friend the next day for lunch, and we split the cheese plate and a couple sandwiches."}
