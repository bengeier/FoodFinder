{"text":"This place is average at best. Ordered a bottle of wine and was asked if I want to smell the cork. Pour some in my glass and I'll smell the wine. I'll look at the cork to make sure the integrity of the wine hasn't be compromised. Isn't that wine tasting 101.  The waitress took our order on an I-Pad, sounds cool, right? Not really, it took a long time for her to punch in our order, it was 3 items that could have easily been memorized or written down. It was awkward having her hover over our table typing this in. The eggplant parm was unedible. The pizza/flatbread was good. The best part of the experience, was the bread with olive oil that they bring out. The bread was amazing."}
{"text":"I love Rustica for a few reasons - unfortunately it's not because of an outstanding wine list or food that is to die for.

The atmosphere rocks. I love going in to hang out for lunch or dinner, and I know I'll enjoy myself.

The food is decent. It's fine Italian food (for the most part). Unfortunately, since the place opened, the menu has changed on a pretty constant basis, and the items that remain are your standard \"Italian\" fare (such as fettuccine alfredo). I think this is because, when the place first opened, they had a unique menu that scared off some people and they felt they needed to bring in more familiar options for the masses. 

This has really taken away from the delight on the menu itself.

The food though is all homemade and fresh, which is great. I just wish they wouldn't keep listening to complaining customers and stick to their guns on some of the more delicious food they offer (bruscetta with fresh, chopped tomatoes instead of cooked tomatoes)."}
{"text":"Rustic has a warm and inviting atmosphere and nice air conditioning too.  We went for lunch and the Panini's are great.  The  staff are knowledgable about the menu items and not too overbearing either.  The dinner menu has most of my favorite dishes as well. We found the prices to be economical for really good food.  The chef goes out of his way to make sure he has the best ingredients and you don't see that much in these money-crunchers times.  I highly recommend Rustica."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Even better beer selection!! Awesome craft beer choices and no bud light in sight :-) This has quickly become one of my favorite new beer spots and restaurants in general. Go now!"}
{"text":"The flatbread is awesome and the white chocolate beer is amazing!! but the last time I was here they over charged my card on the tip.. Be AWARE but yummy food and beer"}
{"text":"Really over all was dissapointed with our visit.  Not horrible, but really not something I will rush back to.  Flavors not real deep, portions avg to less, ambiance is nice overall, but they were out of tea on our visit as well and for the 3 of us on this visit, we just weren't blown away.
We may give it another try, but probably not for a while."}
{"text":"I stopped in to this place a few weeks ago and fell in love! There are so many good things to say...so here it goes.
1. Awesome, friendly, personable staff
2. Great food at great prices
3. Free wifi
4. Great background music (chill, ambient, blues, jazz)
5. Comfortable seating
6. Excellent craft beers on tap.
7. Convenient west valley location (Parkwest at Northern & 101)
A wonderful place to have lunch/dinner. I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my husband and can't say I have any desire to go back. The server was nice, but we sat there just waiting for service for quite a while. The restaurant was pretty empty. When we got our meals I can't say I was impressed. I had the sausage flat bread. It was bread with a few slices of sausage and a lot of sauce, way too much sauce. The sauce drowns out the taste of the sausage. My husbands sandwich was only ok. Maybe the dinner is better than their lunch."}
{"text":"Rustica has great decor, a wonderful looking menu, and is technologically ahead with the use of I-Pads for taking orders and doing dinner checks. (If they worked!)  If that's all you look for in a restaurant, this is the place for you!  Me, I think it's a bonus if the food is edible.  
If I could give Rustica 0 stars, I would.  Here's the run down...It took an hour and a half to get the food and when it finally came, it was terrible. Any dishes with chicken were horrible, dry, tough, and tasteless.  My guess is that they pre-cook all of the chicken breasts, refreeze them, and then reheat them to serve.  That would explain the dryness. The pasta was undercooked and dry, the glasses were dirty, and the manager was rude and unwilling to make things right with us.  Listen, I was a restaurant manger many years ago and anytime there was a problem, I made it right.  I didn't try to make my customers feel as though they were crazy and I never gave them a cocky, \"I'm better than you attitude.\"  I would pay for their dinner and give them a certificate so they could come back and try us again. That's good business.  It's pretty simple. Customers are your bread and butter and if you don't take care of them, your restaurant will go down the tube.  Rustica has been open for 6 months and I predict, that unless they change their attitude and food, it won't last another 6. It's pretty apparent that I'm not the only one who has a similar opinion, (2 1/2 stars isn't that great., guys) So here are the details of the experience if you care to read on.  

A group of women and I went to Rustica to have lunch and although they don't open for lunch typically, they allowed us to make reservations and accommodate our group.  The point is, THEY KNEW WE WERE COMING.  As we arrived I noticed that the decor was very nice, and the menu had many selections that sounded delicious.  I chose the Chicken Panini with a salad, and many others ordered other menu items with chicken.  We chatted but noticed that it was taking an extraordinarily long time for our food to arrive.  By the time it came, it had been over an hour and a half.  Now granted, there were about 20 of us but we were the only ones in the restaurant.  The food was served and as we started to eat, many of us noticed that the chicken in all of our meals was extremely dry and tough.  It was nearly inedible.  In addition, the lettuce was wilted and my daughter noticed that the inside of her water glass that she'd been drinking out of had dried on food residue. When the waitress was asked about it, she tried to say that it was backwash, however we showed her that it was dried on the inside of the glass.  She just simply took the glass away without apology. We complained to the waitress about the food as well, but she didn't offer to replace the meals. However, it's unlikely we would have, given the time it took for us to get our meals in the first place.  We asked a man who went behind the counter if he was the manager and he said, \"Kinda, not really,\" and continued walking.  We talked to the waitress and asked to see the manager.  She said he wasn't there.  Then we saw the same man that had gone behind the counter earlier and asked again if he was the manager and he replied that he was but he was off today.  He came over and  asked what the problem was.  We started to explain and he started asking us questions as to why we were there in an attempt to divert the questioning.  Then he asked, \"Hey are you those red hat ladies that run around town?  Those old ladies are crazy!\"  I told him he was rude yet he gave no response or apology.  He simply tried to cut the conversation short and said he would do something.  His \"do something\" was to give a free desert to one of the ladies, whose birthday it was.  She had picked out the vanilla ice cream with pistachio sauce over it.  It came out, and many of us tasted it.  You know, when you have a container of ice cream in the refrigerator and it sits there long enough to get that ice layer on top, and then you eat it?  Well that's what it tasted like.  It was disgusting.  By the way, it took about 20 minutes for that to come out.  Ok, how hard is it to scoop some ice cream and put it on a plate?  Anyway, needless to say, we asked for our checks and that in itself was a fiasco.  It took forever because of the I-Pads.  

Anyway, suffice it to say this was an extremely disappointing experience all around and hopefully this review will save you from the same waste of time and money that we had.  One positive note though, the house balsamic vinaigrette was delicious, but then, I'd rather save myself the $80 and go buy a bottle of it at Safeway and make my own salad.  
(By the way Rustica, thanks for adding the 18% tip on top of the dinner.  check. We will NOT be coming back.)"}
{"text":"Mr C and I went to Rustica on Friday night. We met at this place when it was the irish pub, so we really wanted to like it. It was still early enough, 6ish and were promptly seated. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the menu looks great. Our server was nice as well. Thats about the best I can say: they were out of black tea. Had ice tea instead. Our appetizer, the ham & brie bruschetta was ok. Tiny portion and not large enough to share really. It tasted ok but issue with it was size. Next our salad, the Arugula salad with tomato, grana padana cheese and lemon juice. It came, no cheese. We asked for the cheese, and about 5 mins later the young gal came back and asked us what kind of cheese we wanted on the salad. Our response, the kind that is supposed to be on the salad. Another few minutes pass and she brings us a side of shredded mozzarella. Finally, the manager comes over to tell us they are out of the correct cheese and what kind did we want? Now.. it seems to me they are the experts in this field.. so I felt they should have come up with the substitution themselves, or advised us of the outage before serving it half assed. Next.. the basil spaghetti and the chicken marsala. UGH. Oh, and let me metion that our table was extremely wobbly and had to have a guy come over and put something under it to keep it from tilting and our drinks spilling. Back the main entrees: The spaghetti came out piping hot, and it was literally, tomato soup topped spaghetti. Clearly, there wasnt anything fresh about the sauce. The best way I can describe the taste of it, was the sauce used for a can of spaghetti O's.  The chicken marsala: the description sounded great, but it was cold. The chicken was clearly a frozen chicken breast, that had never met with direct heat. Not a mark on it to show it had been seared, grilled or otherwise cooked. It was dry. The marsala sauce wasnt.. it was a chicken gravy. The mushroom risotto was like glue. We sent our meal back and said we wouldnt like anything else.  The manager came back over and dare to say, she apologized with attitude that we didnt like the food:  

Sadly, we will not return to this restaurant. Its been open long enough now that the kinks and bugs should have been worked out."}
{"text":"Went here last night (a Friday) for the first time and we will be going back. I have been looking high and low for a decent wine bar/restaurant on the west side with a cool atmosphere for a young couple and finally we found a place. They had live music, the food was pretty good (all made in house obviously not just reheated crap) and the wine/beer/alcohol selection was decent. I'd check it out if you like family owned establishments  and want to support local businesses."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The food is delicious the service is good and it's right by my house ! I've ordered the fish tacos the flatbread pizzas and bruschetta and rustica pasta...it's all delicious ! Also they have a really fine selection of local beers. Personally I enjoy a mixed beer where they mix 5 different beers in one and it tastes like chocolate not sure what it's called sorry ! But you can ask for chelsea she knows what it is ! Last I rarely come for happy hour but i have been once and it's pretty solid 3 dollar reislings and 2.50 blue moons !"}
{"text":"This place has just AWFUL food. My husband and I ordered caprese salad: the mozzarella wasn't fresh, the tomatoes weren't nearly ripe, and the basil was dried, not fresh. Cmon. I ordered the salmon fettucini: the sauce was terribly sour - just gross - and the salmon was freezer burned.  My husband ordered sun dried pesto pasta: again, completely inedible. I'm not a \"hard grader\" and I typically will try to like a local place, but this place has just inexcusably horrible food. The one nice thing was the waitress - she was very sweet and seemed utterly embarrassed about the food she was serving: as there weren't many people in the place, we could observe all the other customers complain and return food. The waitress remained calm and smiling, which took a lot of grace!"}
{"text":"Looked promising from the website, but outside of a really attentive waitstaff, the restaurant was a disappointment.  My wife's filet was tough and gristly (unheard of in a quality filet) and my lamb was dry, hard and tasteless.  Not a cheap place, but not worth the drive to Peoria.  I got the impression the cook tried real hard, but just couldn't pull \"it\" off.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Very nice atomosphere, extremely helpful wait staff.  Owner came to the table a couple times to ask about our meal.   The beer and drink selection was excellent.  We've eaten there twice now and enjoyed the meals each time.  The dessert menu looks excellent, haven't had a chance to try that yet though."}
{"text":"My friend from out of town staying by the stadium requested we go to an Italian restaurant for dinner. I sighed, since I have been looking for a good Italian restaurant my entire life in Arizona and have yet to find such place. I had seen this place the last time I was at the Sandbar and suggested it to him. He said he had gone there for a happy hour but hadn't tried the food, so was in. 
The decor is nice and warm and cozy. I give them points for an inviting atmosphere. The man who sat us was friendly and recommended a bottle of wine to us. He raved about this great wine on their list and convinced us to buy a bottle. A woman, who ended up being our server but didn't introduce herself as such, brought the bottle to us. My friend, the wine aficionado, tasted it and said he didn't like it. He asked me to try it, and I agreed. It was a pretty boring red with no body at all. We said we didn't want it and the server grabbed the bottle and left without saying anything to us the whole time she was there. We decided to go with a chardonnay, because you really can't get chardonnay wrong, but waited forever for the girl to come back so we could order it. When she finally did, she asked if we wanted to start with a glass of it in case we didn't like that one too. What an insulting thing to say. She came back with an over chilled bottle and wanted to put it in a bucket of ice. When we told her it was already too cold and we didn't need ice, she glared at us like we were crazy. 
We asked her if she was our server, since she never introduced herself, so that we could order an appetizer. I really think she was having a bad day because I got the feeling she was really annoyed by us. Sorry, but you took a job called \"server\" which entails serving people. Anyway, we ordered the mussels. I'm not really a seafood person; so don't think I can properly review the mussels since it was the first time I'd had mussels. I will say that they weren't bad, but there wasn't anything about them that would make me order them again. 
For entrees, I had the lamb shank and my friend ordered the pork loin. My lamb fell right off the bone. It was tasty, but not delicious. The risotto was the best tasting thing I had there; that and the broccoli. My friend's pork loin was a bit overcooked and chewy. I could tell it was a good piece of meat and if it was cooked for a few minutes less, would have been delicious. For dessert, we tried the lackluster tiramisu. My first attempt at making tiramisu turned out better than this. 
This place has potential; but the snotty server took away any desire for me to return in a few months when most restaurants work out the kinks. My hopes of finding a great Italian restaurant here were crushed. The great Italian restaurant in Phoenix remains elusive."}
{"text":"Mark and I have been twice now, and we had the same server both times. She's quirky, sweet and prompt. The ambiance is very nice and the wine/beer selection isn't bad at all. If you just want to relax over drinks great. But the food is lacking...I'm not sure if what was missing from the veggie sandwhich was merely cheese, but it left something to be desired. The side salad I had was okay, but not great.. We'll be back for wine or a cold pumpkin beer, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Ok so two stars is generous.  The staff was friendly (not necessarily the manager), the restaurant is cute, has a large beer selection and a decent wine list.  That is about the end of the good.

We were killing time before a movie and wandered in for a glass of wine/beer.  My hubby had a nice Chianti and I had a white chocolate beer which wasn't too bad.  We made the mistake of ordering appetizers.  

I had the fried ravioli which came out on a bed of pureed tomatoes with a heaping of Kraft (if I was lucky) Parmesan cheese.  I'm sorry but how much does real cheese cost?  I would rather have no cheese that powdered crap on my plate.  As far as the \"sauce\" was concerned, ok, I get it you are going for a simple feel so no spices or flavor.  The ravioli tasted like it came out of a box from Wal-Mart. Blech.

My hubby was smarter/luckier and ordered the calamari.  As most people know it is an easy food to screw up but they actually managed to do a good job minus using bar lemon slices instead of a wedge for a garnish.  The sauce that came with was surprisingly tasty.

The server also gave us a plate of bread and oil for dipping.  Who would have thought they could screw that up, right?  Well the oil tasted like canola oil, the seasonings were dried and had just been sprinkled on.  I would have been better off skipping this all together.  

When we dared to mention our concerns to the manager on duty we were informed that \"all fried food is good food\".  And that they knew the oil was a problem but that was something they were working on.  The cheese selection was based upon cost and that the chef really only focused on their entrees and not the appetizers.  Are you freaking kidding me?!  Cheap oil, bad cheese and lousy appetizers will not get a customer to a main course.  

Hopefully, the chef goes to Italy and learns what he is trying to serve to the public."}
{"text":"Omg I got the seafood pasta on the red wine sauce it was amazing"}
{"text":"Happy hour experience here, and the restaurant was empty.  Our server Kelly reminded me of Lillith on Cheers, or the show Frazier for you young kids.  Great beer selection and happy hour food was nicely priced as well.  Place has a more upscale feel to it than the Irish pub here before, though not quite formal or anything like that."}
