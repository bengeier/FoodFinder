{"text":"I used to love this place... as of today that has all changed... the management of this place changed... and now it is reflecting on the food... smaller portion... baked chicken rice used to be an entire chicken breast.. now it is just small chicken bits... fried rice base turned into white rice... flavorful sauce now flavorless.... bubble tea that were included had 1/5th of the cup of bubble.. now i'd be lucky to have more than 5 bubbles... it is really obvious that they are starting to cheap out on everything... buy 10 get 1 baked rice is gone as of oct 30 2016... but i don't think it'll take me that long to stop going... as of TODAY. i will never return to great fountain. RIP"}
{"text":"Amazing great value and huge portion Chinese food. First time I cannot finish whole meal (°°) and only cost around 7 dollars with salad, soup , and drink. I had Garlic Pork Chop w/ Honey Garlic Fish, it's delicious! I like the tender and juicy pork chop, fish is great too. Especially,  the fried rice is surprisingly tasty, its golden color egg fried rice, its not too dry or oil, i love it! Moreover, the drink is the best! I think it's Hong Kong style homemade ice lemon tea, it's real lemon add in. Really really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Seems everything on the menu is ok EXCEPT the chicken.   I've ordered the chicken+tofu twice and each time it was rotten."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, big portions.  This is actually the owner's third fast food joint. She sold the previous ones and moved on every time.   I've eaten her food since I was little. At least 15 years.  One tip: Listen for your number. If it's busy and you take too long, you'll get yelled at."}
{"text":"My boyfriend first introduced me to this place last winter, and I've been hooked ever since. He grew up in Hong Kong and wanted me to get a taste of what real Hong Kong food was like, and I wasn't let down! Every time we are in Toronto, we stop here. The portion sizes are huge, and cost under 7 bucks! Their lemon iced tea is delicious. My only complaint would be I always get too many bones in my soup, but it's easy to eat around them. My go to is (I think) C36, which is a pork chop (though I usually swap it out for chicken), fried egg and a heaping serving of rice with bok choy. Always a hit with me!"}
{"text":"This is the most attention grabbing stall, being in the centre and the biggest, but is so not worth your time.  The food is completely tasteless.  Don't bother.  The adjacent three stores to its left (or to our right when facing the stalls) are much better options.  Or there's also One 2 Snacks, one of the most popular Malaysian street food vendors in the city, just a few steps away on the outside of the plaza."}
{"text":"Food court restaurant ratings:  I frequent this establishment regularly and I must say the food is always good and the quality is consistent.  The price has gone up a bit but let's face it, it's still cheap.  The service is fabulous and always a smile.  After ordering the food, it usually turns out really quick which is a definite plus.  Well done!"}
{"text":"I always order the same thing. Shrimp with scrambled egg on fried rice. Very generous amount of eggs. Delicious fried rice. Sentimental value. Amazing."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese fast food. HK cafe style, I think but please correct me if I'm mistaken  Ordered pork chops with rice and the taste was not bad. I would prefer smaller portions with a lower price as I was not able to finish the food. They also have western style all day breakfast: ham, sausage, toast and fried eggs which is nice if you feel like it.  Their menu is in English/Chinese but daily special is only written in Chinese by the cash register.  Regarding the order pick up.. the lady there could yell out your order number with a mic hanging down from above. So funny but totally understandable given the size of the food court and people sometimes don't wait at the counter and just grab a seat and sit down in the food court. I almost have the urge to write to Mcdonalds on this quirky way of giving out orders lol  I may go back."}
{"text":"Back when I was a High School student, places such as the Great Well made perfect sense because growing boys need lots of food for cheap.  It helped that this place does it FAST and pretty consistent in terms of flavours even though they have an insane menu selection that would make any Food Network Chef CRY.    The menu is so large that you have to walk side-to-side behind or in front of other viewing patrons for around 10 minutes to come up with a preliminary decision.  Restaurant Makeover Chefs please stay away for your own mental health purposes.  They would wonder how they can keep the ingredients fresh, but when they see the flow of patrons then it will justify it won't be any worst ingredients than any other Food Court shop.  Typical Hong Kong style Food Court offerings such as Baked Rice/Spaghettis, Deep Fried Chicken Leg/Wing w/Salad or Fries, however through-out the years they kept extending their Asian repertoire towards South Asian such as Lemon Grass Pork Chops or Viet Pho.  Always comes with complimentary soup and a cold drink.  Min Min T. is right...  Within the Chinese men category that fits into this NO thrills but good/cheap eats and always full stomach satisfaction.  Why so many old couples or guys?  It's the perfect spot for those groups because no one feels out of place here since everyone's goal when coming here is for one purpose only and nothing else.    Come here when you DON'T care about wait staff-service, don't care about atmosphere, don't care about fancy chi chi food, don't care about showing off and spending $$ for a mediocre meal in front of guest/family.  Understand now why it's so EASY to love this place?  This place DEFINES why Scarborough is consistently known for offering valued Chinese fast meals.  The 2 TV at each side of the large seating area makes for something vision to focus on."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Ordered the hot plate with shrimp, steak and chicken with fried rice. It came with bubble tea, and soup. A great deal for $7! Food tasted good overall; steak was tender, shrimp was crispy, but the chicken was a little dry. I didn't like the bubble tea, as the tapioca was still raw in the middle. The food court was clean and I saw a lady going around wiping and cleaning tables."}
{"text":"Great Fountain Fast Food has been here one of the longest, located smack in the middle of the whole food court and takes up the most space with a flashing LED sign. Therefore, it also receives the most attention and business. Occasionally, I see police officers come here and eat as well. This place is usually packed with people, especially high schoolers during the lunch break.  A ton of choices, and the food comes really fast. Last night we got the sizzling teppanyaki hot plate, and it came with fries, pork chops, chicken skillet, sausages, one large piece of broccoli, a soup, some spaghetti and I should have received a bubble tea as well, but they didn't have any tapioca left and asked if I wanted any other \"normal drink\". I think they could have compensated for it, because bubble tea is more expensive, and if it came with the meal, they could have at least asked if we wanted two regular drinks (as I came with my family), or at a discounted price. All this was for less than $10.   Anyways, similar to all teppanyakis at Chinese restaurants, once they pour on the sauce and the plate is brought to the table, EVERYONE in the whole room looks at you cause of the loud noise the teppanyaki plate brings. The food itself is of course Chinese-styled, it's not really comparable to places that do teppanyaki right in front of you as they carefully grill piece by piece in front of you, but, this is definitely worth trying and worth the price. If you go to any other place and order this, sometimes you're looking at around $20 for this kind of meal."}
{"text":"This place is one of the food court choices in the Dynasty Centre food court. Actually of all the stores, they are the busiest one, which is a good sign. Me and my fiance were craving greasy Chinese food, found this place through Yelp, and I am so glad we did!  For only about $6 each order, you get a huge serving of food, soup, and lemon iced tea. The drink tasted really good, and the portions are huge! I ordered Chicken Fried Rice, and my fiance ordered Minced Beef with Chicken Leg on rice. Total came up to around $14 for both meals.  Food was delicious and really filling! Greasy and tasty, would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for a cheap and quick meal. They have a variety of HK Style eats on their extensive menu, which I always have a hard time picking from. My favourite is the Honey Garlic Chicken and Fish on Rice. For $7, with a soup and Iced Lemon Tea, this was a great deal. The Chicken and Fish were lightly fried, and coated with their honey garlic sauce which was good, especially with the egg fried rice. Tons of seating here as it is in a large food court. Been coming here ever since I was a kid, and with the other stores beside coming and going, I'm glad this place is still here."}
{"text":"Agincourt C.I was my high school for 2 years. This place is a 5 minutes walk from the school. Thus I came here very often back then.   I came here for lunch on daily basis and this place never disappointed me. It's in a tiny plaza occupied with many Asian businesses. So if you don't know this area, you are most likely not going to come across here.   Things I like to get are pork chop or garlic crispy chicken, they were delicious. The combo always come with rice or spaghetti, with a drink, and a soup. Most combo costs between $7-9 before tax, so it's really cheap. And the food serves really quick.   So for someone who passes this neighbourhood, I definitely recommend checking this place out. It's good for quick and not so fancy lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered the C10 Curry Soup Seafood Vermicelli for $6.49 before tax. Not bad, the curry was a bit salty but flavourful; was alright if you washed it down with their iced lemon tea that was included in the combo. The bowl was really big--what do you expect for $6?   But...  Not sure what happened to my myopia, but my eyes target-locked onto this \"foreign object\" floating in my soup around 3-4 bites in.   Normally people would flip their sh*t, but being the desensitized human I was, I thought to myself \"Hmm, I probably should stop eating, but I wonder how many foreign objects I could find...\"   *Blinking blankly and pushed tray aside*   Probably should have just stopped eating instead of playing treasure hunter with the vermicelli.   All that to say, food was not terrible but they need to cover their broth!"}
{"text":"Great Well does FAST Chinese food. A HUGE menu that serves all day breakfast, lunch, dinner and afternoon tea items. Most of their items comes with a drink - depending on what you order - a chinese soup is also offered as well. Noodles, rice, sandwiches are standard - and there is probably over 100 items on their menu.   Items are in chinese and english - and their are pictures of almost every item up around their stall. This is standard practice for chinese food court places now. The staff are friendly and efficient. You place your order, they give you a number and you wait - never more than 7 minutes. The food comes hot - and fast. How fast food should be. You are getting your money's worth. Soup noodles are about $5-6 for a giant bowl and you get a drink with that too. Fried dishes are about the same - but huge portions!   They also offer dinner items - sizzling hot plates with a variety of steaks (chicken, beef, pork, fish cutlet), fries, rice and some veggies - drink and soup for about $10-13. Seriously blows my mind how inexpensive you can eat here.  Breakfast - popular are the soup noodles paired with choice of ham, spam, hot dog chicken, beef, fish (basically any type of meat), egg and a side buttered bread white bread (bread isn't great). They're good about substituting choice of noodles.   They are really good w/ special request - less oil, less salt, less sauce, holding certain ingredients.   My go to items:  dan dan soup noodles w/GIANT tofu fish balls - spicy and creamy soup base, peanuts and thick noodles and a couple of pieces of chinese veggies comes w/iced drink (abt $5) rice w/fish cutlet - a good portion of fish fillet is nicely fried. They have it with a variety of sauces - meat sauce, tomato and top it off with fried egg on top (ask for it to be a little runny) comes with soup and a drink (abt $5.00)  They have tvs at both ends of the food court with fairchild chinese programming on at all times.   This is a clean up after yourself place - throw your garbage away - and try not to leave a mess for the next people using your table. They have a cleaning lady there to wipe down trays and tables and empty garbage cans.   Great Well is the most popular stall out of the ones in this plaza and have been there the longest. They always have the longest line, and yet, it moves so efficiently, and the staff members are friendly! FAST, HOT, and INEXPENSIVE food - quality is not #1. But when you need a hot meal, and have a $5 bill in hand and a bunch of change this is the place to spend that money.  Cash only as far as I know."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is the huge selection of HK Chinese style food with photos for you to choose from (breakfast/lunch/dinner).  This is the largest food court stall I've ever seen (in an Asian food court).  To handle all the customers, they have 5-6 staff on hand at any given time which is incredible since most stalls typically only have 1-2.  There are often line ups during peak hours, while all the other stalls are empty.  You can come to this place for HK style breakfast till evening when the mall closes.  Today I ordered the Salted Chicken Noodle Soup Served with Lemon Iced Tea $5.25.  It didn't have much taste, as I found with some of their other soup noodles (the ones that come with breakfast).  But their other selection of foods make up for the lack of flavour in their noodles.   They also have yin yang rice (\"chicken & shrimp with two kinds of sauce on rice\") with soup and drink for $5.25"}
{"text":"Chinese foodcourt fastfood. So many variety of food to choose from. Lots of pictures displayed of the foods they serve.  Great value: for just over $7 including tax you can get a full meal with soup and a lemon ice tea. I got a pork chop with rice on meat sauce. The portions were large and filling too. We also got a beef steak with tofu on rice for the same price. I was so surprised at how soft and tender the piece of steak was."}
{"text":"Hidden in a strip mall in Agincourt, Great Well Fast Food is the largest and most popular shop in a shabby Chinese food court.  Sometimes high school kids come here for lunch from Agincourt C.I., but typically they're mostly Chinese men or old couples.  ORDERING: Around the counter is the menu, hand-written in both Chinese and English; pictures of some of the dishes will help those unfamiliar with Asian cuisine. The kitchen here is amazingly fast, I'm not actually sure how many people are on a single shift, but it's quite  a lot! Once you make your order, you are given a piece of cardboard with a number and wait for your order to be called. You won't have to wait longer than 10 minutes.  VEG OPTIONS: Towards the bottom righthand side of the menues is a list of a dozen vegetarian options.  I ordered the 'baked garden rice with cheeze, white sauce and vegetables' (it sounds a lot nicer in Cantonese) and Singaporean rice noodle for $13!  That also included a Hong-Kong-style milk tea WITH tapioca and a cup of soy milk.   Wait, wait, there's more.   They also give you a bowl of daily soup - I've had a simple vegetable broth and a hot-and-overly-sour soup.  Considering everything that you get for that price, it's an awesome deal!  The only thing that bugs me is the excessive use of Styrofoam. It's not haute cuisine, but it really hits the spot when you're famished!  TIP: If you plan on coming often, ask for a card. Once you buy 10 meals, you get your 11th free."}
{"text":"2.5*Again in search for the greatest curry to ever exist on the planet.   To all the high schoolers and poor adults like me out there, this is the go to place for lunch and dinner. Cheap, cheaper and cheapest and that's about the best advantage they have here. Of course you might say you get what you pay for. And I won't deny it, it is cheap. For the combo I ordered, it only cost $7. Also they completed and delivered the order at the light of speed so that's a plus for people who are in a hurry  Ok, now let's talk about the curry itself. Presentation is not bad it looks very attractive for what I paid for.( Btw ordered a baked cheese and beef brisket curry). However it's the taste department that's lacking. It simply just tasted like salty sauce that looks like curry. Portion wise it is very filling, even for a fat dude like me it filled me up quite good ;). Other than that there is not much to say about this Hong Kong style curry. If you're an imaginative person you'll probably be able to recreate the curry flavour in your mouth when you're eating this. But if you're a dull person like me, you'll taste a bland pile of mess with rice.  Don't get me wrong I am judging the restaurant just based on this dish and I am strict with my curry. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to people who want a cheap and filling meal.  ?: 3/5 (dish appearance) ?: 3/5 (dish scent) ?: 1/5 (dish taste)"}
{"text":"Great Fountain Fast Food had been a fixture at this food court since I was a kid and offers a wide variety of traditional HK-style food. I've been coming here for years mainly for their baked rice, and it never disappoints! Service is relatively quick and there's plenty of seating in the food court. The food itself is pretty decent (especially the baked rice) and though prices have gone up over the years, they're still reasonable."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast food in a small food court. All items come with free soup and usually a lemon tea. This is the most popular stall in the food court and for good reason. The menu is posted with pictures for every item so there's no guesswork in what your meal will consist of. Cash only establishment but super cheap and filling combos. Cannot go wrong when you're in a rush."}
{"text":"I really got overwhelmed when I trying to decide what I want to order at Great Fountain Fast Food!  All these colourful food photos, all screaming my name, telling me to choose them..... But I have to tell them \"I am so sorry.. I am not that hungry.. I am not going to eat all these fried food...\"  If you are looking for healthy options.. I doubt you can find that many at Great Fountain..but for people that are eating here, the goal is not to be healthy.. it is value, taste and fast service, and Great Fountain for sure deliver!!  Toasted with Condensed Milk with Tea ($2.20) - all these condensed milk dripping out of my white toast... don't even start me on the sugar level.. I just eat worry about it later..  - Chinese dessert??  I will definitely will be coming back to try out other items...but what should I try next???? Too many choices here really stress me out!!"}
{"text":"The food court here may as well be entirely theirs (at one point it nearly was, but they decided to go back to its original size), since that's what almost EVERYONE in here is for, and for a good reason too.  Lots of choices to the point it's overwhelming at times, food is served quick, tastes good for it's value (most food can be paid for with a $5 bill), and you get a LOT of it. Yep, all checks out for a good fast food place. Now if only they'll do something about those weak forks/knives they give..."}
{"text":"This place is located inside a food court (right in the centre), and seems to be the most popular stall too. They have a very extensive menu at very affordable prices. The portions are quite large, and the food is good considering how quickly they have to serve everyone.   Bang for your buck."}
