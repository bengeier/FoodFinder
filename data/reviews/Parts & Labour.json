{"text":"-5 stars!! Worst place ever. Don't bother going here you will definitely regret it. 

Save your money for a better serviced, hygienic, more organized and professional establishment. 


(You would think when a party of 40+ people are coming they would provide better service considering all the money you just brought into this dump for them) 


No one from that birthday will ever be wasting our time making that mistake again."}
{"text":"See my review for Burger's Priest. Same thing applies here."}
{"text":"Two of us went here at 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and it was really busy. We had the pork belly and the burger. The burger was delicious. At 11 pm, the main floor dining area shuts down and there's a party in the basement. We didn't stay for that, but there were a lot of people waiting prior to 11 to go to the party downstairs. Was a fun place with good ambiance - good for groups of 4 to 6 people. Most of the plates are meant for sharing."}
{"text":"The cover wasn't bad ($5) and the music downstairs was great.
However this place is desperately in need of a coat check. All in all pretty decent and fun."}
{"text":"The space feels a bit cavernous. When we arrived we were told we had the table for 2.5 hours. Oh. That wasn't mentioned when we booked. Our server was amazing but the manager came and asked us to keep it down. I really have no idea why- the kids sitting nearby??? Please!! The music was loud and it was Saturday night after 8! The cocktails were delish. The burger and frites were good but the wagu not so much. The pasta tasted fine but all of the plating was really blah, so uninspired! The 50s music in the basement was obscure and boring."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here a few months ago for dinner after hearing good reviews. We were let down, mostly by the atmosphere. 

We were seated at a group table (which I know is becoming more typical of many \"hip\" places - aka places that want to cram as many customers in as possible) but we had made reservations, so I thought we might be able to get an actual table for two. The seating was beyond cramped, it was extremely uncomfortable. 

The worst part of all was how incredibly loud it was. Sure it was at night, sure I know it's a place for friends and drinks and letting loose, but never have I ever experienced such a noisy place. I could not ever hear a word that my boyfriend was saying from mere inches across the table. The waitress had to crouch down every time she or I had to communicate. It was completely insane. I cannot stress enough how loud it was, it was louder than being in front of a giant speaker at a concert. So unpleasant. 

Food wise we were happy though. We both had the P&L burger which was the only saving grace for the night. It was quite delicious. 

So I would say go in a group that can completely fill a table unless you are in the mood for getting an extremely terrible headache while sitting silently between 20 other people at your table that you don't know."}
{"text":"I'm gonna give this the full 5. 

To start it's a great room. You might think the communal table idea could get outta hand, but it's handled well. They seat groups at either end of the table and then infill as the night goes on. But it really doesn't feel like you're \"stuck\" with other diners. And then the whole restaurant takes on this nicely busy look with heads and conversation all around you.

Decor is a concept piece... fire extinguishers made into bar lights, the Castor light fixtures over the table. Minimal, but not cold. Dark and warm. 

It helps that the crowd and the staff are an attractive bunch, but there was no sense of this being a scene. Ages and looks were mixed. 

We were a party of four... we had the short-ribs ragu, the steak frites, the polenta, and the burger. I inhaled the ragu. I won't try and dissect it. As good as a Terroni pasta dish. I sampled the steak and the polenta dishes. Steak frites was flawless. 

But it was the polenta that got me. I'm going back for that. As it was, my sister-in-law had the polenta and I was stealing off her plate the whole time. Mmmmm. Polenta.

Service was brisk and constant---except--I think our desert order got botched. A few inquisitive glances at our server and he came over to confirm they were taking too long, something had gone wrong, and they would be off the bill. Actually it gave us more time just to sip wine & coffee. 

Flourless chocolate cake and strawberry ice cream. Not too big. Not too sweet. Beautiful texture and tastes. Once again, close to flawless."}
{"text":"Seriously hipster vibe with easy going staff to match!  I came here for a Summerlicious dinner with some girlfriends... first off, we were waiting for one friend for almost an hour and our waitress was totally cool about the wait.  I can't recall the number of times an evening's been ruined because of the staff rushing us along because they wanted to turn their tables.  Not Here.  
The food was good.. there was a kale salad with anchovies that they were able to make completely vegetarian for me, it was a bit too lemony for me, though my gfs seemed to like it that way.  Potato gnocchi was delicious and so was the icecream sundae which was actually quite good.. though I expected to be the m'eh aspect of the meal.

Liked it so much - am going back again for another friend's birthday today!"}
{"text":"I can only write for the drinks and the downstairs area. The service was incredibly attentive upstairs. the security grads are super nice even help me and my friend to skip the cover $$$
  
not a big fan of downstairs to be honest, although i had my birthday there at once and it was PACKED.
 musics are nice on Wednesdays, wknd gets carzy busy."}
{"text":"interesting yet simple decor with communal tables with long fluorescent light bulbs grouped together to make what looked like large light tubes.  We made reservations for 6:30pm on a Thursday. This place was pretty empty but soon got really busy & was buzzing with people around 8pm. 

The server explained that the menu recently changed so they didn't have many specials and were just focusing on the menu items. 

We started off with the roasted bone marrow ($17) with sea salt served with a white bean puree and a parsley salad.  We all enjoyed it.  Topped off our bread with the puree, the melt in your mouth marrow and the parsley salad. The parsley gave it a refreshing taste to the otherwise savoury app. 

I opted for the papadelle that came with sweetbread, peas, oyster mushrooms and  talleggio ($20). The talleggio came in large chunks and didn't really melt into the pasta so I either cut it into smaller pieces or just ate the whole thing.  Sweetbreads were more meaty than others that I have tried which had more of a fatty texture to them. It was pretty good but a bit bland.  The dish could have been hotter as well.  It was warm by the time I got it so half way through it was cold. 

My friend got the ham hock with a rasher of bacon on polenta.
New word learned: rasher = slice.  We asked our waiter and he had to confirm since he didn't know either (which made us feel better for not knowing).  The ham was really tender and almost had a duck confit texture to it.  I had a bite and enjoyed it though my friend thought that the whole dish got a bit too salty towards the end. 

This place was good and I think once they get more comfortable with the new menu it'll be better."}
{"text":"So the reason we came is because we have watched Matty on Tv. Have to give it a try. We were blown away. The food was excellent, the service was Superb (the servers were so awesome to my  kids and didn't treat us like \"those people\"who bring their kids with them). I was glad we made the reservation and went, it was truly a memorable meal. Thanks to all the crew for making my an anniversary awesome!"}
{"text":"Went to P&L for dinner with friends...we sat at one of the chef's tables beside the kitchen. It was great fun seeing the giant slab of pork i ordered go down on the grill. Started with the pork belly - done perfectly with a lovely bit of crackling on top ( pork on pork) and followed that with the special, a giant pork chop, cooked to perfection with plenty of juice pooling on my plate (pork on pork on pork). The best part was the relaxed staff who casually took great care of us, joked with us and generally made us feel very comfortable. A decent, if short, wine list and a very good selection of local and premium beers helped. I'll be back.

PS: other commenters found it loud: it is certainly an active, busy restaurant, but i didn't find the noise level detracted from our evening....it was quite acceptable."}
{"text":"Went to Parts & Labour for Summerlicious.  What a disappointment.

The prix fix menu was $35 and I would not have paid more than $20 for the food that was presented.

I started with the mackerel with pickles.  The mackerel was really quite fantastic, perfectly done, with nice crispy skin.  The pickles and the garnishes were OK.  This was about an $8 value in my view.

The main was a hanger steak, which I ordered medium rare.  This was the biggest disappointment of the evening.  The steak itself was decent, but the portion served was ridiculously small.  And this coming from a person who hates large steaks.  Seriously, the portion was the 1/4 of the size that any reputable restauranteur would ever deem appropriate to serve as the absolute minimum in a meal.  Disgraceful.  And worse, it was delivered to me two shades below even lukewarm.  

The lemon marshmallow desert, while decent (not great) was also embarrassingly small.  This was more like a $4 desert sampler, overpriced at that.

Again, this is coming from someone who DOES NOT LIKE BIG PORTIONS.  But for having a few beers, I would have had to eat another meal.

Clearly, the owners were trying to make money off of Summerlicious which is a poor marketing strategy.  Mostly because the whole experience was so chintzy that I will never eat there again.

One more precious bit.  I had a beer while I was waiting for my friend to arrive, and when we got our table, I asked if the bill could be transfered to our table.  The bartender refused to do so, and made it seem like she was doing me a favour in the process.  And, because I had no cash, I had to pay debit and she gave me the stink eye when I paid.  I understand the complications re: tipping and the like, but Christ, work it out amongst yourselves.

All in all, will never eat there again."}
{"text":"the dessert was phenomenal! in fact we demolished the first order and then immediately reordered it again so we could \"kill it\" one more time - and this coming from a girl who would rather have a slab of pork belly than a slab of cake! 

the beef tartare was a huge disappointment but the fried qual,  gnocchi and burger were huge winners at the table. portions are pretty small so prepare to order multiple dishes and eat family style.  the menu is set up this way and is divided between veg/meat/dessert as suppose to app/main/dessert."}
{"text":"Frequent this place on the regular as it's local and a pretty solid choice for meeting up with friends or new acquaintances. 

The burger deal on Wednesdays has gotta be one of the best deals in town! I go pretty much most Wednesdays for a burger, fries and a pint - all weighing in at a very reasonable $15! 

Can't speak to the rest of the menu so much, but the atmosphere is awesome and the staff are always real friendly and attentive. 

Definitely a Parkdale spot to check out."}
{"text":"I never experienced what all the other reviewers said. My two friends have never heard of the place or seen the burger wars show, they only heard through me. This review is not to compare with DD or BP. To each their own, all three burgers have their unique taste and texture and they are so very delicious.

About the restaurant very chic modern with cafeteria style seating. Nevertheless, all three of us ordered the P&L burger just for the nostalgia. (I'm wondering if they read the reviews and improved) The burger came out within 10mins, the bun was nicely toasted and the 1/4lbs patty was cooked medium with all the juices dripping all over my fries. It did not have a frozen taste, but there was a stronger presence of pepper. The meat definitely was ground meat as the texture of the meat was brittle enough to fall apart. The burger was quite epic for the first time....

What I didn't like, the amount of handmade shoestring fries, they were so crispy but so little.  As well, the special burger sauce didn't have a strong taste, but I'm wondering if the chef wanted the meat to shine instead??  

I would return as patrons beside me ordered some interesting dishes that looked good too!"}
{"text":"What a cool place :)  very relaxed, chill atmosphere and very utilitarian decor. I went on a wednesday night and tried out there P&L burger special: a MASSIVE burger with fries and a pint for $15. For the pint they let me pick from any of the beers they had on tap which was surprising. I settled on a Boneshaker. When the burger came, I was impressed. Thing is huge! I could barely get my mouth around it. The only thing is, the burger was so piled with stuff that it was kind of hard to eat and pretty messy. Bring your bibs people! The service was decent. The server forgot about my pint for a while, but remembered when he saw me staring forlornly at the other thirst-quenching beverages my neighbours were drinking. Other than that though, all of the servers were really friendly and efficient. I would defintely come back here."}
{"text":"went to P&L and was very disappointed. Had the mac & cheese, which was flavourless (they didn't even appear to have used salt and/or pepper) and was stone cold. If you want overpriced, flavourless food in a loud, obnoxious environment, then this is the place for you"}
{"text":"Upon entering Parts and Labour, I was surprised by how large the space was. I've been accustomed to tiny little trendy restaurants that don't take reservations so this was a welcomed change. Despite its large size, the restaurant only communal tables with some seating along the bar. 

What went into my belly:

Bone Marrow - with bacon onion jam & crostini ($22). I don't think this dish was meant for 2 people as it came with two enormous bones. I loved the bacon and caramelized onions which topped the marrow. While this was one of the best bone marrow dishes I've had, I'd recommend only ordering this if you have at least four people. It's an incredibly rich and heavy dish.

Terrine Board which comes in two sizes - small for $25 or large for $35. Since there was only 2 of us, we went for the small. It came with an oxtail and snail terrine (my favourite!), beef liverwurst, pork shoulder rilette, pork head cheese and a country terrine. Some items were better than others but still worth ordering. 

the Beef Tartare - black garlic emulsion, soy egg yolk, horseradish, fingerling chips ($15). The tartare was coarsely chopped and the garlic emulsion was a nice touch. I also appreciated the fingerling chips which gave the tartare a bit of a crunch. Overall, a decent tartare but nothing special.

Grilled Octopus - Merguez, celery, potato, tarragon mayo, chervil, cardoon ($13). It was a pretty petite plate which was welcomed by us since we had ordered very heavy dishes to start off our meal. A pretty good dish.

While there were some dishes more memorable than others, it was a solid meal overall. Don't forget to order the bone marrow - my favourite dish of the evening!"}
{"text":"I've been to many places around town for food, many are on top food critic's list, a lot of tapas places but some aren't, many are on the higher priced end but still pretty great quality and bang for my bucks, but this hipster joint I gotta say is a HUGH disappointment.  With four people in total at my table we pretty much ate our self poor with how small the proportion is to the price of each items so in the end after five tapas dishes each costing  around 20 bucks average each we had to order  one of their fat bastards fish of ribs and wings to get full on which cost 70 bucks, our bill after light amount of drinks and a small shared donut dessert was 300 with tips........:S.  The taste also is only average really, fast food taste.  The tapas dishes were suggested that each person have two dishes each to be full, trust me at our table of Asians even two couldn't fill us.  If you guys are looking for tapas rather go make a reservation a week earlier at bar Isabel, ten times better and is on many international top food list.  Even electric mud or grand electric or like terroni wouldn't disappoint you as much."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place and I can't believe it's taken me so long to try it.  As I've said in other reviews, Winterlicious usually isn't the best time to try a place, but at Parts & Labour, it didn't even matter.

Food was awesome--I indulged and went for the pork belly starter, and oh my god, what a treat.  Perfect tender meat, with a salty crispy crust--delicious.  The steak was perfectly cooked and the fries were delicious (though the lack of vegetables on the plate made me sad).  Dessert was homemade doughnuts fresh from the kitchen--amazing.  There was a bit of a delay in getting all of our party served (about half the doughnuts came out noticeably later than the rest), so I suppose they needed to fry them in batches.

The restaurant is a bit chilly, though--it's a large space that must be difficult to heat, and the walls are left bare so voices bounce off easily, so it feels a bit unfriendly.  That aside, the service was amazingly attentive and the food was delicious, so I'll do my best to go back when it's not 'Licious season!"}
{"text":"Meh. . It was nothing special. After hearing such amazing reviews of this place I was a bit disappointed. I ordered a couple of their special cocktails which were not very good, the flavours they added did not work together. Our group ordered the grilled octopus - which was tough and fishy, cauliflower- tastey, my friends both ordered the lamb - not bad , I ordered the burger which was also pretty tasty - wouldn't say it was the best I had though. Overall ok, wouldn't say I'd go back. So many other places worth checking out."}
{"text":"Simply, this is what dinning out is all about!! Had a great meal and experience while at Part and Labour for dinner on a Saturday night.
Make reservations because it gets packed. The FOH is very friendly, and the wait staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and extremely pleasant and helpful. 
The menus is chef inspired, loaded with flavour and creativity and designed for sharing (Don't come here alone!).  The bartenders are also equally aggressive with their original and fun cocktails.
It is dark and loud, if that's not your thing... be prepared. Also, they have large communal tables, they will try to give you some buffer space between others, but when it's busy, it's busy.
I had a great experience at Parts and Labour, and I hope you do too!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for my birthday a few weekends back. We had a table of 13 people for dinner and more people joined for drinks after. First of all, I picked this place because I love the décor and the vibe of the space. It's a very chic industrial design without feeling cold and old. Secondly, my party and I were particularly interested in their sharing plates. There was a bit of a mix up with their Mobile-version menu (which has now been fixed) and their web-version menu. Anyway, I was initially extremely disappointed that after days of communicating back and forth with the organizers from P&L regarding the menu that it wasn't available. However, the manager that night, (Martin, I think was his name) came out and completely accommodated us in the most amazing manner. I've dined at many five-star restaurants internationally and the service provided by the staff and the manager and their attitude was so exceptional. They truly made the night incredible and I'd recommend it to anyone thinking of having a larger party at a cool space with amazing staff!! Thank you to everyone again!!"}
{"text":"Never again. I knew going in that it would be overpriced but it was a friends birthday  and she wanted to try it out. Let's start with the service: unbelievably rude waitress that barely noticed our table (we had to go to the bar to get a drink twice). We ordered two meals and a birthday donut, and each individual plate took more that a half an hour to reach our table. The food.. Gross!!! Had the P&L burger and was less than impressed. The birthday donut was fine but nothing special. 

Regardless we were excited to check out the club downstairs. The end of our meal comes finally at 11:45 (not by choice) and we go to head down to the club. At the door were told the cut off for dinner guests was 11:30 for advanced line; something that our waitress never mentioned even though we had said we were going to their club. When we went to ask her about it she got extremely defensive and said \"we didn't spend enough to warrant an advanced line & they were at capacity.\" 

So we spent over 150$ to eat crappy food from a rude wait staff and didn't even make it into the club. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I've been to parts and labour a few times for drinks. It's has never been my favourite place to go as I find it to be way too loud inside. 

Last night was my first time dining here, so I feel I can now review this place fairly. 

The place is super trendy. It has a cool vibe going and the crowd is young hipster-ish. 

I had the burger, and a Greek cheese appetizer. Though not bad, both where nothing to talk about. Burger and fries where $18. You better cook a mean burger for that price.

My friend had a pasta type dish (can't remember what it was called) that was pretty tasty. It had some kick to it. I wish I ordered that instead. It was not great, but had more flavour than the burger.

Parts and Labour is just not my scene, but it's a cool place and I understand it's appeal. It not a place that I would ever choose to go to. 
I would say, for the prices of the food, it's not that great, so skip this place for dinner and just head here for drinks."}
{"text":"3/5. Definitely try their specials and be adventurous. Unique setup."}
{"text":"This is a great space, with good music, a cool vibe and visually interesting decor, patrons and staff. It is typically Queen West West, in the pervasive hipster ethos and relentless trendiness of everything within it, right down to the oh so unique punk bar downstairs. However, and this is a big however for a restaurant, the food was unremarkable except when it was actually bad. The steak tartare lacked seasoning and was ridiculously oversized- appeared to be a supermarket package of ground beef flipped onto a plate and than decorated with artfully scattered crackers; the vegetable terrine was sent back for having an unpleasent bitter aftertaste; the other dishes were only so-so. I should note however, that the cocktails were fabulous- my manhattan was wonderfull with the olive instead of cherry a nice modification.
Where Parts and Labour shines is in drinks and in atmosphere- in short it would make a great bar, instead of a mediocre trendy restaurant on a strip choked with them."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times including last Friday for a Birthday party.
Service was excellent (we had a party of 20) and they were very accommodating.

I had their famous hamburger and fries. Really Good!!! The menu is quite limited. Our whole table of 10 ended up with the same meal.
We will return."}
{"text":"I went here for Halloween and had a fantabulous time.
It's been a while since I've gone somewhere and was able to say \"hotdamn that place was banging\" (and yes I do talk like that... esp. after a bevvie or two). 

The upstairs seemed nice, more of a hang time hob-nob locale. I didn't stay up there long however because my feet needed to find the dancefloor.

The downstairs was playing amazing Brit rock/pop/punk/80's/New wave awesomeness that made me dance my ass off all night.

I really have nothing negative to say... nice loungey upstairs, low ceiling divebar-esque dancefloor downstairs. It was like 2 amazing worlds colliding.

I didn't try the food or cocktails, I stuck with beer. Service was swift and prices were ok.

Now granted, I was a tad gibbled so I am looking forward to going back soon to see if my beer gogles measure up to reality. 

I don't think I'll be disappointed.


EDIT #1: 
Went back recently on a Friday, once again had a great effing time downstairs in the basement dancetastic party place. However, more sober this time realized the beer selection was ok... not much in bottles mostly tallboy cans... and average pricing as well. But this by no means impeded my night.

I have yet to eat here. heh.

EDIT #2: 
My office had our xmas party there. Upstairs this time. The food was delicious! I don't know if we were fed meal options from their menu but if this is what comes out of their kitchen, I'm sure their regular menu will not disappoint! Also the wait staff was great even though several of us were likely annoyingly gibbled. It was an open bar."}
{"text":"Put the team of the Social, Oddfellows and Castor Design together and out comes Parts and Labour.  Uber trendy with a splash of punk rocker rawness all done with an urban artsy feel.  Cylindrical light fixtures and bright coloured pot lights hang from the ceilings with an abundance of car parts as in windshields and mirrors throughout the 5000 square foot space which is bustling with energy.  This is a great addition to the mix of restos in Parkdale from Cowbell, the Local Kitchen and Mitzi's Sister making this a strip as a destination for culninary delights and fun times.  This Friday, P & L is full of parkdale hipster types with their scarves around their necks, thick black glasses and checkered shirts, and ladies with fun t-shirts and stilettos on, it's definitely kicking tonight. 
My appetizer is the roasted bone marrow presented on the actual bone, with white bean puree and crostinis on a herb salad.  The marrow is rich and creamy and you need to scoop it out of the bones with a spoon.  For presentation alone it's worth ordering.The 12 Oz pork chop bone in, with a layered potato and bacon napoleon-like block that was so delicious and also oozed with cheese flavour along side some greens and apple cider sauce perfectly plated on a butcher's wood board.  The pork was cooked medium and was a bit dry and it was a huge entree.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish the meat but did manage to finish the potato layered cake!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, pretty good service, pretty bad food. The burgers looked good, but my seafood stew was very strange - more like a black bean soup with terribly over cooked seafood and a charred piece of baguette. My friends trout tasted ok but was cold, and an $18 beet salad contained 3 beets and was bland. Go for drinks, eat first."}
{"text":"I think that Parts and Labour should have a warning sign affixed to its exterior, similar to the rules and regulations posted at public swimming pools. The proposed signage would read something like this:
1. Warning: If you are over the age of 26, you will likely want to flee the premises before 11:30pm. Busloads of young people clad in either lycra, Affliction, Naked and Famous, or an ironic combination of the three, are likely to invade the bar.
2. Although we make every attempt to deter our patrons from fist pumping and 'sexy grinding'  by playing Ariel Pink very loudly, please note that it is likely this embarrassing behavior will still take place after 12pm. 
3. If you are dining with us and would like to carry a conversation with your guest(s), we would advise that you sit at the bar. Be warned that if you dine at a communal table, you may be seated next to a group of fashionable but inexperienced diners with a lot of disposable income, who consider taleggio and polenta a culinary adventure.
4. The cocktails here, when properly mixed, are pretty tasty. Our bartenders should receive props, especially in light of the post-traumatic stress they must experience  while dealing with a portion of our clientele (see #1).
5. Be brave."}
{"text":"It was another gorgeous but chilly day in Toronto when I headed to Parkdale and met with a group of five girls for Brunch. This time around we had a reservation for one of my favourite spots in Parkdale, Parts and Labour. Even though it was not my first, second, nor third time at Parts and Labour, I was excited because I am always hunting for the perfect brunch spot in Toronto. I usually go for Parts and Labour for dinner and drinks, or just to visit \"The Shop\", a place that reminds of a high-school-basement-party with cool DJs, kitschy decor, and a hipster crowd. Anyway, today was my first brunch at the restaurant and I am happy that I went there. The layout of the space is great! Communal tables, long bar, and I just noticed today (there are two tables by the kitchen - four guests per table). The decor is modern, industrial. The bar has a gazillion light fixtures of different colours and heights, all with their wiring exposed.

If someone asks me why do I like Parts and Labour so much I will probably say...\"because of the drinks\". The food snob in me does not like to admit it but that's the truth. We were the first guests to arrive and as soon as we sat, I was eager to get the drink menu and order my favourite cocktail, the Western Hinny. Trouble is that they don't serve their dinner cocktails during Brunch, only Mimosas, but I am happy to report that our bartender was gracious enough to fulfill not only my wish but the wish of three other girls from our table. It is very nice when we find people who are willing to bend the rules here and there. We were all very grateful! Quality of service should be always stated in a restaurant review.

I had a steak and eggs with béarnaise sauce and home fries. It is needles to say that I barely ate the potatoes but I was very happy with my steak. It was tender and juicy. Just perfect! The other girls had the halibut with white beans, the french toast with poached pear, and the fried chicken (that one I tasted and it was very good).

I definitely I will keep coming back for more at Parts and Labour. It is not in my top five list of brunch places in Toronto but where else will I get a Western Hinny?"}
{"text":"Been to Parts & Labour many times over the years, both for food (once held a  successful set-menu dinner party for about 20 people here) and simply for drinks both upstairs and downstairs. Never had a problem. Always thought it was a cool place with a lot to offer.

That all changed last week.

My friends and I planned to hold another (yes, not our first) set-menu dinner party at Parts & Labour. We exchanged emails and phone calls with the restaurant, settled on a date and price, and then sent out our invitations to our guests. We finalized everything with Parts & Labour in early October, for a reservation in mid-December.
Now, over a month later, Parts & Labour calls us and tells us they are cancelling our reservation because they've recently booked another event on that night.

Despicable customer service. The definition of putting dollars before reputation. P&L you've ruined your reputation in our eyes. We were longtime repeat customers who are now never coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first night of Winterlicious this past Friday. We had a very good meal (I had octopus on crostini and cornish hen; my husband had steak tartare and the burger - even though it wasn't on the menu - we asked for it and they gave it to us!) We sat at the bar and were served by two delightful bartenders. However, at the end of our night, when the bill arrived, there was a mistake on our tab. The bottle of wine we ordered (which was listed on the drink list as $55) was listed for $65 (with the correct name). We pointed this out to our bartender who was willing and eager to correct the mistake. A few minutes later, the bar manager comes up to us, slams the new bill down in front of us, and tells us, with pretty much the most Toronto-hipster-snobbish-attitude that one could relish (and yes I am FROM Toronto), that we were correct, and that the $10 difference will be taken out of her \"cut for the night\" and then stared at us blankly. My husband trying to be nice said we didn't want to inconvenience anyone, at which time she repeated  that she would personally be losing money for this \"typo\" on the menu that we pointed out. Nothing in this situation made sense - but the bottom line is that the bar manager was incredibly rude, callous, and likely shouldn't be working in a customer service industry. The fact that she tried to blame / guilt us for this error that we had nothing to do with was ridiculous. We did then speak to the restaurant manager and he dealt with this situation very professionally and bought us a drink. Overall, a really fun night - with a sour taste left in our mouths by one individual that either was having the worst day of her life and taking it out on us, or more likely, just not a very nice person who shouldn't be working amongst other humans."}
{"text":"wonderful bar, lounge and resto in Parkdale. Stunning fully stocked bar, wide open space with some interesting details. The food is surprisingly good. Very high quality and executed perfectly.  Probabaly the best place to eat and drink in the neighbourhood. Well priced and wide range. Very comfortable and totally accessible. Basement is a venue for bands and entertainment."}
{"text":"I eat out about 5 nights a week and I consider Parts & Labour to be as good as is it gets. The service is awesome and the environment is cooler than anywhere in Toronto. Furthermore, their \"Large Bastard\" lamb shank is my favorite dish in the city. If you wanna go out with friends or a date, I would highly recommend it.

I should also mention that I've been here more times than I can count and in the past two years the food and service has been dialed in to a point where literally everything on the menu is 5 star. The food is always delivered by an excellent server, explained in full and with a smile. 

Just go! Order the Shank! It literally falls off the bone. Nonetheless, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It's a great place. No question."}
{"text":"First negative experience here when I ordered the fried chicken option at brunch. Wasn't a fan: much of the batter was burnt and the chicken was (in my opinion) borderline undercooked... you know that texture where you're like \"...ehhhh I'm not really sure I should be eating this\". 

Well, I cut it all open and the red veins turned me off. Put it off to the side and didn't eat it, very politely informed server during meal and continued on rest of food. 

Was very surprised to see it still on the bill at the end of the meal. I inquired and the server said \"well the chef said that's how it is supposed to look, and if you don't like it...well then you just don't like it\". So I asked for a manager and then magically they didn't fight to keep it on. 

Not great PNL. NOT GREAT."}
{"text":"Parts and labour burger (\"Toronto's best burger\" as per Food Network)
$15.00 
Had high expectations to try the \"best burger\" in Toronto. Burger took 45 mins to come out and was not worth the wait at all. Burger was cooked medium but extremely dry, and no flavour at all.  Condiments were onions, mayo and cheese. Sesame seed bun that you get at loblaws, nothing special. Not creativity or thought put into the burger. Burger had slight odour of frozen meat. Okay in size. Tastes unseasoned and bland. Not worth returning to. Communal table was cool. Otherwise very blah and disappointing experience. Not even worth a picture."}
{"text":"Maybe a little overpriced for what they do. But the burgers are pretty awesome (what they are known for). Waitstaff are very good. Bar staff knowledgeable. 

Can't really fault it aside from I think it is a bit overpriced. 

Nice vibe always very busy!"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times, usually at night for a drink, a dance party in the basement and Summerlicious. 

The food has some nice subtle sauces but otherwise a bit pricey for average ingredients aiming for more. The drink list pretty good for craft beer.

I keep returning for the industrial design style meets cottage country. The service is friendly for a high-end hipster joint - an island of upscale in an area of mostly downscale sketch."}
{"text":"If you're going to do brunch, this is the way to do it. 

Parts and Labour manages to be completely satisfying and completely surprising at the same time. A difficult balance when it comes to breakfast foods! The space doesn't have your typical sunny, brunch-y decor (looking at you, Cora's), instead it's stylish! Go figure, I'm told they also rock a pretty good dinner menu as well.

I had the steak and eggs, scrambled instead of poached. My request was not looked down upon and just made the meal that much more enjoyable to me. It was a perfectly cooked and seasoned, medium rare steak on a bed of gorgeous French fires. The best? Dipping the fries in the shallot jus that slightly pooled at the bottom of the plate. Crispy shallots on top made a few bites soar a couple extra notches. 

A sweet part of this whole deal was the service. Nothing was too fast or too slow. Everyone just seemed genuinely excited for us to be there. When our server asked how everything was, he said it in a way that actually meant/sounded like \"How is it? Effing amazing, eh? Yeah, I know, right?! Good decision, guys\" 

It's the kind of meal and experience I would gladly wake up early-ish for again, to trek to Queen West and beat those Sunday rushes."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic brunch, we had the pancakes, the Korean fried chicken and the smoked salmon and and I can't decide which I liked best. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Cannot compliment this place enough. We've been several times and we aren't even hipsters! Mr Matheson and his crew do things with beef and pork I didn't know were possible. Have had the burger multiple times which is outstanding, the pig tails will change your life, the lemon curd whipped cheesecake is other worldly. The waiters are friendly, courteous and know their cocktails. Other than Geraldine's it's one of the few places who know how to serve Absinthe correctly too. 

Only downside we've found is that if you go to eat a little later in the evening it can get very busy and very loud! Having said that though it certainly won't stop us from eating here as often as we can. Also do yourself a favour and check out Matti's Munchies videos on YouTube!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Matty Matheson;s Parts and Labour.

My first visit was on a Wednesday for their $20 burger and pint special. The burgers were top notch, however I was disappointed that the kitchen ran out of pepperoncini's.

Second visit, ordered some beers, burgers, and mac&cheese. The burger buns were over toasted, which I disliked, however the overall burger was tasty. I would request for it be cooked medium rare instead of the suggested medium next time. The mac and cheese was not as good as my last visit. It was served warm instead of piping hot (from what I last remember). The service was good, and the server brought over some side P&L Sauce for my burger and a cup of their homemade hot sauce. She even gave us complimentary stamps for the club downstairs which was very lively on a Friday night with DJ music and a bar.

** Parts & Labour has great beer. The Ace Hill drought tasted fresh and it seems like the bar cleans their taps regularly unlike some places. Coors Banquet comes in little mugs which was cool."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that this place used to be a hardware store.  
Sure you have to wander down a dark street full of shady characters and run-down shops... but once you step inside...

Exposed white brick walls, long wooden tables, brightly colored lamps, accented by random parts... trendy and fun!

We perched ourselves at the bar and reviewed the recently updated drink menu.  

The food menu didn't look all that bad.  Because of the mixed reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. 

We had the steak tartar... which was alright.  Maybe the kitchen was closing and they were in a hurry, but I wasn't overly impressed with our snack.  A bit too warm, not chopped finely enough... very peppery... I still ate it.

However, I liked the drinks and the bar staff was totally awesome.  
The Wild Celery and Blood Orange cocktail was wicked easy going down.
Not \"sour\", heavy on the Grand Marnier, but good.

It's a fun place!  I didn't know that they had a downstairs area.
Curious, we wandered downstairs where it's a club with one of the worst sound systems I've ever heard.  I felt like I stumbled upon a basement party full of drunk teenagers.

Yeah, I think I'll stick to enjoying my drinks upstairs."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about this place.  Not only was the restaurant decor great but the service and food was excellent.  We went on a friday night with our infant and the waiter asked me if i wanted to seat myself somewhere else as he said there is a draft coming down the wall and didn't want my baby to be cold.  Then he brought my husband downstairs to an area for private functions and said that he could change our baby in there since they dont have a change table.  He made some terrific recommendations, which we ordered and all the food was amazing. We ordered the special, a very pricey entree, $60 but it was well worth it. It was an awesome seafood pie that I wish they had on their regular menu. I am certainly going back there soon as there were quite a few different dishes I need to try!"}
{"text":"This is purely a review of the brunch here. I didn't go for dinner nor for drinks.

This was one of the best brunches I've had in a very long time. I got the P&L which is essentially two fried eggs on top of hash on top of pork on top of a pancake which is then surround by a fabulous maple trotteur sauce. This might sound like a strange combination but it's delicious. It all goes so well together and it was cooked perfectly. 

My brunch companions both had the steak and eggs and were in pure ecstasy as long as they had food on their plates. You get a nicely-sized steak with two perfectly poached eggs and fries, topped with an absolutely delicious au jus sauce. It's such a simple meal but when it's done as well as it was done here, it becomes a thing of excellence. 

I also had a ceasar, extra spicy, because I wanted to try one of their drinks. I think this may have been one of the best ceasar's I've ever had, with fresh horseradish and a pickled carrot. 

I would go back every Sunday for their brunch if I could."}
{"text":"Eclectic crowd and different and interesting food, I highly recommend this for something different and fun. Great starting point for the night!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a group of 5 people on a Saturday night. The place was easy to find on Queen and there's street parking right in front of the restaurant. We made reservations although it didn't look like we had to because the place wasn't too packed. 

This restaurant has 5-6 rows of communal tables one behind another. And along those tables on the other side is where the bar is. We each ordered our own main dish and shared 4 plates. We ordered the Grilled Octopus dish which I thought was average, nothing special. Also ordered the 3 for $22 side special - 2 plates of Mac and Cheese and 1 plate of Grilled Mushrooms. The Grilled Mushrooms comes with a uncooked egg yolk in the middle to pop and mix and it was delicious. The Mac and Cheese again were below average I would say.

For the main, I got the P&L Burger. This was delicious and super filling. I heard lots of people raving about this burger and it didn't disappoint but I don't think it would be something I would be craving the taste of. Still really good though! I also ordered their Dark and Stormy drink, it was my first time having the drink and I loved it. I typically don't love a rum-based drink but you couldn't even taste the rum and there's a strong ginger flavour to it (FYI for all those non-ginger lovers - not for you)."}
{"text":"I've been to Parts and Labour a few times both for dinner in the afternoon and drinks later in the evening. 

I love how this bar/restaurant was once a community hardware store. From the name to the old hardware store sign outside to the leftover industrial fixings inside - the old character of the hardware store still rings through in every corner.

What I don't love are the long picnic style tables - They provide truly awkward seating unless you're coming for dinner with a large group, which makes me think that Parts and Labour needs to decide whether it's going more down the bar or restaurant route...

The food isn't bad, though it isn't distinctive or flavourful enough to merit the hefty price tag that it comes with. To tell you the truth, I don't even remember what I ate when I had dinner there... enough said.

The late night bar portion of Parts and Labour is definitely the reason to visit this place. The crowd is cool, and isn't pretentious like the downtown bar/club crowd can sometimes be. A DJ spins decent music, and if you so desire, there's a club downstairs (that I believe there is a cover for). On the plus side, I've never had to wait in line to get into the bar at night time, and it usually isn't too crowded."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with friends and got the Fried Chicken. It was just alright. It seemed to be their take on Chicken and Waffles but without the waffle. 

Given that it was $22 and thus nearly $30 after tax and tip - definitely not worth it! It tastes a bit like Popeyes Chicken, except I'm pretty sure that Popeyes tastes better. It comes with 3 pieces, on top of a sad piece of white bread. As in, it looked like it was sitting in top of a small slice of Wonderbread. 

I hear that they're more known for their burgers, so maybe try getting that instead. 

The service was alright. The actual restaurant's vibes are ok as well, with long communal benches that are cafeteria esque."}
{"text":"Went to P/L for the burger.  Mine was charred on the bottom and yet pink in the middle. Sadly I still have a bitter taste in my mouth from it. The service was really good, but I cant eat that"}
{"text":"Let me be very clear - this is good, rich, hearty, filling food. Good lord did I ever sleep like a baby after my meal here last night. It's a great restaurant if a meat-heavy meal is what you're in the mood for.

Seven of us went here for dinner last night. No need for a rezo (probably because it was a tuesday night and raining cats and dogs) and we had a great big table all for us. The place is aesthetically surprising - you'd expect it to be a smaller, homelier place, but instead it's an expansive seating area, a long attractive bar and what looks to be a drinking/dancing floor in the back, but which may have just been absent of tables that particular evening. Local celeb Kent P. ordered some fancy cocktail. I had a glass of the riesling which was just fine for an Ontario wine with some unbearably lame name like \"Smooth Criminal\" or something equally embarrassing. Two flutes of prosecco for ladies and some beers as well. Bottles were well priced at $5 and the wine a bit steeper at around $11 a drink.

Starters were great. Onion soup and snails, a light red lettuce salad, seared fish , but the show stopper was certainly the terrine plate. The 'small' - it comes in two sizes - was big enough for the seven of us to all eat from. Each part was fantastic and while I can't remember each treat I do know that a duck mousse was particularly good.

We ordered three bottles of wine, a reasonable Montepulciano for $40 which went great with everything. Many plates at the table, but in my humble option the 10 oz steak which I ordered took the cake. A bit well done for my liking, but still delicious. And with marrow and butter it was hard to be displeased. Kent's shoestring fries came out cold - not uncommon with shoestring - but my cottage fries were very crispy and good. A side of sprouts with ham and hot peppers was also delicious.

We skipped dessert and coffee but I would guess that they would have been as good as everything else. 

Generally the whole experience was nice. Good company and good food. But in many ways Parts & Labour just reminded me of a less exciting Hawksmore - the very popular London steakhouse. It was good hearty food and I enjoyed it all, but apart from a few interesting side notes, like the marrow butter, nothing jumped out as too exciting. 

Ultimately it's the same criticism I levelled (perhaps unfairly) at the wonderful people at Woodlot - everything was regularly cooked good food. The steak at P&L was great, but not amazing. Even the terrine could have been easily found at any one of the boutique food stores in Toronto. Maybe that is a foolish ground for criticism, but I do want more than the convenience of not cooking when I eat out. 

Parts & Labour was good, but attentive staff seemed indifferent to our meals (the head waiter - perhaps owner? - however, was fantastic)  which were not that different from what I make at home. That wouldn't be a big deal except that our night ended up costing $100 each with tip. Not too crazy for a good meal, but a bit deflating when you think about getting your steak, sprouts and terrine at the Friendly Butcher, three bottles of Chateauneuf  at the LCBO and having just as nice a night in.

Good, but not great."}
{"text":"Brutal Service.  
Went with a large group and were made to feel as if that was a bad thing.
Food is standard.  Anyone who knows how to make a burger wouldn't think much of the 1+ hour wait for a Harvey's styled sandwich."}
{"text":"Went to a party in the basement area on a Friday night- so crowded I could hardly move, low ceilings, awful music that was way too loud, and every staff member I encountered was RUDE and does not belong in a customer-facing position.

Maybe the food is good, but I doubt I'll come back to try it."}
{"text":"I came here after watching Burger Wars on CMT last week. The show crowned the P&L Burger THE BEST BURGER IN TORONTO. Parts and Labour beat out Dangerous Dans and Burgers Priest so I just had to go and taste this so called masterpiece. 

The restaurant is beautiful , clean and spacious. The servers were all quite nice and attentive. 
The downside was its a hipster hangout and I cant stand those sort of places. 

The P&L burger DID NOT live up to the hype. It was a big burger but the meat was flavourless and tasted like there was a thick layer of canola oil in the middle of the patty. I was honestly disgusted by this and am mystified as to how this was able to beat Dangerous Dans amazing and huge $6 burgers. The P&L was $15 which included fries. 

I was disappointed that I drove from Vaughan to taste the best burger in Toronto just to find that I could have drove 2 minutes down the road to the McDonalds to get a much tastier Big Mac."}
{"text":"A nice, quiet place to have a good meal in Parkdale. Everything I've had here has been pretty good and the burgers are excellent. Everything is reasonably priced and the bar is solid."}
{"text":"I came to Toronto for Memorial Day weekend with a plan to eat brunch at P&L and I was definitely rewarded with an amazing experience. My friend and I ordered the pancakes, the pork schnitzel, and the P&L burger. The pancakes were the fluffiest I've ever eaten, and the burger was a delicious combination of flavors. The schnitzel was also wonderful, and it came with an amazing sauce. I also had a refreshing cocktail infused with Earl Grey. My only regret is that I wasn't able to eat more. Top notch."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious but was unfortunately was not impressed.

For appetizer we had the octopus and the beef salad. The octopus was pretty good and enjoyed the dip that came with the taro chips. The beef salad wasn't bad either.

The entree was subpar. We got the steak and the pork tenderloin. The steak was cooked fine But I think could definitely be seasoned more. The salad was the worst part. I felt they didn't really do anything with it. They pretty much threw oil and vinegar on the very bitter watercress and some raw shallots and thai chilis  (which was also what seems like on everything else on the menu). My partner also did not enjoy the pork very much.

The dessert was meh as well. I found my trifle cake dry. My partner also didn't really care for the chocolate cake either. As with most restaurants doing Summerlicious, dessert always seems like an after thought or not fresh.

My partner may give the regular menu a chance, but I think I'd rather go to other restaurants.

I also want to mention that their chairs are extremely uncomfortable, and the server we had didn't seem like she was familiar with the menu. I mentioned to her that the shallots are raw (my stomach doesn't really do well with raw onions, which I understand was my fault for not making that clear in the first place), and she said they were pickled but clearly was not, she then just says it's a garnish.... I don't think she understands what a garnish is. She then pretty much avoided us other than to take our plates and give us our check for the rest of the night.

All in all, this is my honest review. Best of luck.

Food: 2/5
Service: 2/5
Atmosphere: 3/5"}
{"text":"I only went here for brunch, but with the Hoof Cafe closed, this has to be the best brunch in the city. 

The seared pig ear was fantastic. There are two fried eggs in truffle oil that sit a top of a spicy hash. Underneath the spicy hash lies the crispy pigs ear. It's very tasty. The demi that accompanies the dish adds another great component. 

My companion had the P & L fried eggs with pork belly, pancakes and hash. She was as impressed as I was. The pancake was moist, and as somebody wrote above, the trotter sauce is really delicious. 

Further, for Toronto brunch, neither dish was that expensive. The P & L fried eggs with pork belly came out to $14, while the seared pig ear was $12. And when so many brunch places gouge for coffee, Parts and Labour charges a reasonable $1.50 for some very good drip coffee. 

Great brunch, will definitely be going back very soon."}
{"text":"When you walk into Parts, you feel as if you have just stepped into the coolest scenester joint in Brooklyn, NYC.  I would like to consider myself a relatively cool person, however, no matter how stylish I may feel that day, P and L will always have the upper hand.  A renovated former hardware store turned restaurant/bar/lounge with an awesome live music venue in the basement equals one of the best ideas ever!  I was really bummed out when I heard that Oddfellow's was closing=(.   I shed a tear in honour of the delicious stews and all you can eat taco night.  I was sceptical of this new establishment and longed for my tall can of stiegl and stew in the private side room at Oddfellows.  It looks like you need protection, from this new Westside Connection=) haha O.k. it is important to keep an open mind. And P and L is now right by my house. Bonus! 

I had the privy of attending the opening of P and L. I have never felt so unhip in my life!  My cousin was responsible for creating the soul artwork that hangs in the joint; a beautiful series of cast metal sculptures of the great lakes( I helped with a little bit of Lake Superior, watch out Warhol! hahaha).  http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/10/view/9614/joy-charbonneau-ed-zec-great-lakes.html.

The vibe of the place is actually super chill and friendly.  At first thought I would need to get some crazy tattoos and be clad in plaid to be accepted, however, not the case at all. There are several long communal tables with Brian Richer's amazing cylindrical fluorescent light fixtures hanging above them.  They are stunning and super funky.   Hanging above the length of the bar are unusual fire extinguisher light installations in various colors. The bar stools are giant springs with leather seats. Very cool!  The music is always awesome, however, sometimes the acoustics in the main area have some reverb.  So, I would suggest if you are trying to have an intimate conversation to try to grab a table at the back by the kitchen.  Oh the food. Matty the executive chef is so nice and fantastic at what he does. The menu is very interesting and channels a traditional French reliance on game meat and rich flavors.  I went once for brunch but in retrospect my selection of pancakes was too safe and I was left feeling uninspired.  However, the burger is one of the best that I have ever had! The P and L sauce makes McDonald's big mac seem like the grossest thing on the planet.  The garlic aioli on the French fries is out of this world!  I highly recommend the dish and the establishment. 

All and all I love Parts and Labour!  So fun to sit at a communal table and potentially make some new friends over coctkails=) Another gastronomic treasure and a too hip to be square joint in Parkdale. But make um understand Its Westside foe Life!"}
{"text":"I can only vouch for the drinks and the downstairs area. The service was incredibly attentive upstairs, and our waiter even helped us bypass the cover-paying situation to get to the dance party downstairs.

I was glad he did, because as soon as we got downstairs I felt like I was back in high school. We were in a basement. I mean...it was obvious we were in a basement, because we had willingly walked downstairs, but it was like a 7.5 foot ceiling, no windows, suburban basement.

Then we started getting really into the music and realized that it was kind of awesome to feel like you were at a basement party again where the booze was flowing and best of all...no curfew!"}
{"text":"Parkdale you say? Queen PAST Landsdowne? I was definitely out of my area of familiarity, but another Sunday, another brunch date with two lovely gentlemen. One of whom drives. Score. Still, this was a bit of a trek for me (clearly not for all the lovely people who live in Parkdale) but it would have been worth if it it was great. Grand Electric was great. (Review coming.) I have to say, I was pretty disappointed with Parts & Labour.

The boys had the English Breakfast. The streaky bacon was really really yummy, and it was pretty authentic says the boy with the British Passport. Authentic, but very very salty. Still, they gave it a decent rating. 

I ordered the P&L. Now, imagine a pancake topped with potato hash, pork belly, and a single fried egg. Now picture that with about 1/4-1/3 cup of canola oil poured on top, and now you know what I had for breakfast (and why I had a quinoa salad for dinner). It was greasy, oily, and gave my a tummy ache. The meal is described at having a maple trotter sauce. You know what a bowl of oil with balsamic vinegar looks like? Now picture a pancake in the middle of that and that is what I got. A literal puddle of oil 1-2 inches in diameter around my meal. Totally unappealing.

And the other thing? It wasn't cheap. $70 for brunch and coffee for 3 people. 100% not worth the price."}
{"text":"This review is not based on the restaurant since I've never been for food... It is based solely on the \"club\". 

I was with a work friend on a Friday night and had plans to meet up with some other colleagues at parts & labour. Naturally, we had a few cocktails at my apartment before going to the bar. We had a good buzz going on, but were not drunk by any means. 

We took a cab to the front entrance and got out. There was no line so we just went right up to the bouncer who immediately said \"you can't come in\". My friend and I looked at each other in confusion for a second and then I asked him why. He responded that it was because we were \"too wasted\". Looking around me I saw many people having a smoke who could barely stand... And here were my friend and I, totally coherent and standing up straight. He then told us it was because we \"stumbled\" out of the cab. WTF?

He asked us if we had anything to drink and I told him that we had a few cocktails before coming... I wasn't going to lie. He then told me that I just \"admitted to being drunk\". What?! I'm pretty sure every person there had a few cocktails before going out. Don't feed me that lame BS. 

Another bouncer then got involved after a while of conversation, this one was more aggressive. After still trying to understand why it was that we weren't allowed to enter, he then told me to \"get the f*** out of here!\" He proceeded to pick me up and literally carry me to the street. Naturally, this did not go well with me. 

I asked to speak to a manager or owner, who coincidentally just came out at that moment. I then told him what happened and couldn't have cared less. He said the decision was up to the discretion of the door guys. Fine. 

I still don't understand why I wasn't let in. Maybe because I'm not straight? I don't know... But you can guarantee that I will never waste my time visiting this poor excuse of an establishment or arguing with their douche bag bouncers. 

I had invited my best friend to join us earlier that day and he refused without hesitation. He said it was full of \"pretentious douchebags\". This was confirmed ten fold by seeing the bouncers behavior first hand, but also by another thing. Amidst my conversation with the bouncer, a young couple were giggling at the situation and calling me names.. Making fun of me for wearing a baseball cap. You're cool!!! (sarcasm...lol) I'm not shy so I told them to \"shut the f*** up\". The guy then got involved telling me to leave. Who are you?! Don't get involved in something that has nothing to do with you. My friend was right. Douche bags!! 

Anyways, I was livid by the end of the night, and had quite possibly one of the worst nights out of my adulthood thanks to parts & labour. Don't go if you're looking for a fun time with cool people."}
{"text":"I visited P&L for an event, so I can only comment on the food, not the service or pricing because this was not a regular visit, but a 4 course menu with cocktails.

We had the opportunity to try some dishes P&L had to offer, so let's get to the food. The first course was appetizers, Steak Tartare, Salmon Crudo and Pig Tails. The steak was not like a tartare I'd ever had before; rather than it being in patty form and seasoned, it was mixed with the pickled carrot and charred jalapeno peppers. I had no idea it was the Steak Tartare when it arrived at the table. It was delightful. I think the masking of it being raw beef helped, but it was rich and flavourful. 

The Salmon Crudo was intense! I didn't realize it had seranno peppers in it and took a huge bite. Holy crap! Glad they had large bottles of water on the table! Being I'm not great with heat, I didn't enjoy this dish. I love salmon, but I couldn't taste anything but the heat of the peppers. Others loved it. Guess I'll have to keep working on my heat threshold. *sigh* 

My favourite was Pig Tails! Confused when it arrived, we were hungry enough to figure it out. We grabbed a scallion pancake, put some pork and marinated, grilled red cabbage in it and dove in. The pork was ground and in a patty seasoned to perfection. The cabbage gave this great crunch to the softness of the pancake. Mmmm. I definitely finished off what was left on the plate. No regrets! I'd get this again and again. 

Next was a course of veggies done in the best ways ever. I've decided that Roasted Baby Carrots should always be served with ricotta; the apple cider gastrique and caraway crumbs were just a bonus. We may or may not have tried to stab each other for the last one. The Roasted Cauliflower was ok. There was almost too much going on with the sunchoke chips, ricotta, and salsa verde. My favourite was the Grilled Broccolini. MMMM!! Broccoli with black sesame, pecorino and a fried egg on top. Whoever thought of this deserves a hug. I definitely finished this one off while the others were fighting for carrots. Teehee. 

Meat time! Served up next was the P&L Burger and Fried Chicken. The burger was great! Fresh toppings and super juicy. I love me a burger and this hit the spot. The Fried Chicken was alright, not special, but still good. 

The venue decor was simple and functional. Lots of clean lines, large tables, but not a lot of colour. The bar is the focal point here, coloured lights and lots of bottles. It was a nice place, good for a large group!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 4 times now and am extremely impressed with the service, and the atmosphere is great. On one night we had a group of 12 and not a single hiccup. Drinks arrived promptly and no waiting to order more as the wait staff was very attentive but at the same time unobtrusive. They made a special night even more special. Justin and staff were awesome and we will most definately be going back!"}
{"text":"Had a not so good meal at P&L last night. Three of us went for the Cote Du Boeuf special. We were excited and even more so when we arrive and told there was one left and it was for us!  Wow, was I ever surprised by the plate. The meat was ok - nothing special and very fatty. Broccolini was ok but it could have been cooked more. The sauce they serve with the meat is awful; super salty and tastes like it came from a can. All in all, not impressed at all by the P&L CDB.  Things got really bad when we got home and both had to rush to the bathroom (thankfully we have two) immediately and repeatedly. 

I do enjoy the P&L burger but I think that's it for me. I also had the \"pork belly\" there recently and it was actually a cottage ham, no belly in sight... What the?"}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch. We were greeted at the door and welcomed. It wasn't very crowded so we had a whole long table just for the two of us. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. Since it was brunch I started off with P L cesaer, which is an amazing Bloody Mary. It was almost a meal in itself. Definitely a work of art. With the guidance of our waiter, we order the P L Club and pork patty sandwich. They were delicious and you could taste how fresh the ingredients were in both sandwiches. We may return to Toronto just for another visit to Parts and Labor."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the bar--my favorite bar in Toronto! The bartenders (Goldie and another person whose name I'm sorry I never got!) were super nice, wildly helpful, recommended several great bars & restaurants (including Geraldine next door) to check out while I was in town, and MOST IMPORTANTLY made some FANTASTIC drinks--one of which involved gin and what I believe was an entire muddled orange. I liked P&L so much, in fact, that I started my evening there early and came back later, when things were more... up tempo."}
{"text":"After watching Burger Wars Toronto, I decided to check out Toronto's #1 burger.  So, I went to Parts and Labour.  I ordered a crawfish appetizer which was absolutely flavorful.  It was light and came with a dipping sauce that had the consistency of mayo and a hint of spice.  Then I had the P&L burger which came with loads of crispy, tasty shoestring fries.  The burger was hands down one of the best burger I have ever tasted.   The patty came in medium, it was juicy and seasoned just right.  The toppings and the bread perfectly balances with the meat.  The flavours blended well and it wasn't overwhelming like most burgers.  The fries were amazing.  It tasted fresh and seasoned to perfection.  I can see why the P&L burger has been voted as #1.  I would come back!"}
{"text":"Having been to Oddfellows numerous times, I was looking forward to a trip a bit further out west than usual, to Parts and Labour in Parkdale.  Upon entering the restaurant, I was a bit taken aback by the size of the space.  It's quite large, with a long bar and numerous communal tables near the exposed brick wall.  Very spacious and overall a cool vibe with the music and peeps drinking and eating.

We arrived on a Saturday night without reservations and were seated immediately without any issues.  The food is more refined than you might expect for a Parkdale resto-bar.  My partner opted for the wild roof salad which was dressed with a very tasty buttermilk honey dressing.  I chose the crispy pork belly for a starter and was very pleased.  The outside of the pork belly was wonderfully crisp and full of flavour.  It was served over toast with a side of spicy mustard.  Definitely a good way to start off.

She decided on the polenta for a main which she absolutely loved.  It was creamy and rich and for some reason not something you see that often on restaurant menus.  I was boring and chose the burger, which was good, but nothing spectacular.  The bacon was overly fatty and the bun by the end of it all was soggy and falling apart.  Don't get me wrong, it was a tasty burger, but nothing fantastic.

For dessert, we tried the \"Candy Plate\".  These are all homemade treats, including roasted marshmallows!  You can't really go wrong with roasted marshmallows, so that was a nice treat.  The peppermint patty was a bit too crunch, and I was somewhat disappointed the peanut butter cups were not in that evening.

Overall, given the decor and vibe, coupled with the above-average food, this is definitely a place I'd return to in the future.  I believe brunch just started there on Sept 12th so a return trip may be sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for winterliscious.  The food was average, but note that this is not reflective of their regular menu.  

Service was pleasant and expected.  

I would say that this is a good place for casual get together of 4± friends."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for the Saturday before Halloween.

Bonus points: They were playing the Monster Mash as we walked in, which I had been waiting ALL NIGHT to hear! 

There was a $10 cover, which was fine, considering it was a casual bar upstairs with a more dancy area downstairs. The crowd was a ton of fun and most people had made their own costumes, I didn't see ONE sexy bumblebee or sexy police officer! I guess this place draws a real nerdy/artsy crowd. Drink prices were standard for most places, though there were drink specials ($5 jagermeister).

The bartenders were super friendly. 

I really enjoyed my night here! I look forward to checking it out again!"}
{"text":"Incredible service. The bar tenders and the host were very kind, welcoming and checked up on us quite frequently. The cocktails are awesome (try the white mustang) and the prices for booze are fair. I love the dim lighting, the hardware decor, and the fact that the bar is so clean and organized. We also had fries which were awesome. The crowd is also super chill. Great for groups or for dates."}
{"text":"Were from Los Angeles, but we looooove Matty's show on munchies. So when i got married (part 2) in Ottawa, my boys and I had to drive to Toronto to check this out. Glad we were there on Tuesday, so we were able to try Matty's Tuesday night Chicken special. comes with about 4-5 pieces of fried chicken and 2 sides ($26). 

It was ok. but thats sad because OK shouldnt be the case for Matty. I didnt know if this was the pickled brine, or just normal chicken. But i cant hate. i come from a place where fried chicken is a regular thing and everyone has their own special blend. But in Toronto, where there isnt too many fired chicken joints, this was probably their best. 

Ill try them out again in the future to try and kill my minor disappointment 

but them Mac and Cheesuz Christ tho!!!!!!!!!! BANGBANG"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday with a party of about 12. I thought it was an okay looking place and definitely clean. I thought the service was good.

The reason for the low score is that in my opinion the food was nowhere worth the cost, simple as that it didn't blow me away and I didn't feel the value was anywhere close to what it should have been. I didn't know this place won awards for their burger but I didn't finish mine but that was more about the mayo like sauce and I don't like mayo.

I would never come back or recommend P&L to a friend but service was good so 2 stars."}
{"text":"Get the elk, get the burger, GET THE MARROW!!!!
AVOID THE OYSTER MUSHROOM SALAD.  

=)"}
{"text":"Just had my first meal at P&L. The overall experience, especially the service staff, was exceptional! I came on a Tuesday so I gravitated towards the fried chicken special with some collard greens and Mac n' cheese. The chicken was a thing of dreams: the ultimate contrast of textures, and the side dishes were amazing (perhaps the serving was a bit small, but nothing to scoff at). I highly recommend the donut for dessert. Trust me, it'll comfortable feed 3-4 with just the 'small' order. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday, and picked it as the criteria was a one stop shop, Dinner + lounge/club that wasn't pretentious and had good food. 
I would give the DINNER 3 stars, but the club downstairs 1 star. 

Let me explain. 

Making RESERVATIONS was quite easy, but they did insist there was a $30 charge per person, just to make sure we all were eating a meal, and not just snacks.  We were also told that we couldn't really get a private area, I realized later, it's because it's a big open space with communal tables. These tables could fit about 14 people, but doesn't help that seating is not benches, but very wide plastic chairs. Any stragglers would have to sit at a shared table next door. 
Also, I wanted to bring a cake, but the slicing / plating fee was $3 a person. Ridiculous. 

The MENU has a bunch of Appetizers (Plates) that range from $10-15. And Entrees that range from ($18-30). Between the 3 of us, we ordered 2 plates, 2 entrees and a side. It was totally enough. 
The only thing was that there was a lot of new ingredients and words that I had no idea, and had to keep asking the server. Not saying they needed to explain it all, but at the same time, the descriptions could have been more straight forward, rather than deceiving. 

The SERVICE was a decent speed, and the server nice. Except: 
 - when I asked her about this dish that I kept seeing passed around that looked good (after our meal), she told me that it was the special, and because some of the party wanted to order right away, she didn't have time to tell us on the other end of the table. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS! I bet I spoke her a dozen times before we actually ordered, asking about items on the menu. I was quite upset, because we totally would have ordered the whole roasted Partridge. 
 - one of the items I asked about was Gnudi. She explained to us that it was \"potatoless gnocci, stuffed with cheese, deep fried, and covered with sauce and more cheese\". When it came, it was 4 big balls of ricotta cheese deep fried. It looked nothing like gnocchi. I think this is unacceptable. 

Here what we got:
 - mejoohl dates, stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon (5 pieces, recommended)
 - roasted bone  (2 veal bones with marrow) Excellent, and it's veal and not pork for the first time
 - gnudi (for $17 it was not worth it) 3 balls
 - half roasted smoked chicken. This was excellent chicken, and well worth the $27. I did see that others who ordered this had crispier skin than ours, but still very good
 - side of broccoli rape with chili. there was a skunky flavour to this, and I thought it tasted like the smell of MJ if that makes any sense. Would not order this again. ($8)
 - dessert was yummy. chocolate pudding with marshmellow toasted on top. a stale ginger cookie came with ($8)

Things that other got:
 - steaks were listed as Kansas Cut. When asked what it was, it was described as something with the bone in.  As it arrives, it was a big thick slab of meat, and I was told completely different than described. The frites tasted very good. 
 - cooki and creme terrine. Something unique, and was quite tasty. 

Total cost for 3 people sharing was about $42 without drinks. But including the 18% mandatory tip for over 8 people. I bet you know how I feel about paying this tip given what happened. 

They also do not give separate bills. I never understand why restaurants refuse this. The receipt even shows that she had to pick all the seats. Well, we brought out a pen and calculator, and figured it out. Good thing we were sober. 

Then we went downstairs to THE SHOP. They have a DJ and live music here. It's a small narrow basement, unfinished floors, but it was cozy. Mixed drinks were $4  and so were OV Premium beers. 
At first the Dj was mixing some old rock and roll tunes and although a bit loud, seemed nice. 

But then it got worse. The LIVE BAND showed up, and decided to crank up the volume even more. With more speakers in this basement than it needs, it got loud quickly. And the band wanted it even louder. We couldn't hear each other, and couldn't think! The birthday boy CC had to make makeshift earplugs so as not to destroy his ears. And the music wasn't amazing either. We quickly left, disappointed. 

I usually give places 4 stars for something I really loved and would come again. 3 stars for the food, but 2 for the service. The price points seem a bit expensive for what you get and the food didn't wow me (except the chicken)."}
{"text":"Parts & Labour is a trendy restaurant in Parkdale. The decor has a bit of a garage vibe. The lights above the communal tables look like lights that you would find in a garage. It also has a bit of a hipster cafeteria vibe. Apparently, the restaurant made a name for itself by hosting punk acts and hip-hop dance parties on Saturdays.

I came here for brunch. I would say that it is worth the trek to Parkdale. The brunch menu covers the essentials, steak and eggs, as well as, a few other creative dishes. The steak and eggs were very good. The drinks were also very good. 

The prices are reasonable. The service is attentive. I would recommend Parts & Labour if you want to check out a brunch place that is out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious with friends. I chose the restaurant because of the vegan menu. I was not let down by the food but found the service very sub par. We waited a long time for plates to be cleared between courses, had different servers throughout the night and were not given any insight or explanation into the menu choices. The restaurant is organized with long tables so we were at a shared table with several other parties. For a $38 set menu I would much prefer to not sit beside strangers ... won't be going back."}
{"text":"Cool vibe.  Like the location.  Service was good.  Cool staff.  Not fond of the table seatings.  Long tables of 10. We were 4 and we sat at a table with 2 others ( that were seated in the middle of this long table ) when asked if we could move to another table and perhaps take the 4 seats at the end with no one in the middle the hostess said no because eventually we would be sitting beside others anyways.  With a full house you end up sitting shoulder to shoulder with strangers. It's a bit uncomfortable and awkward that you can hear their whole conversation and vice versa.  
It was the winner of burger wars and we all choose the burger.   Not sure why it won.  It was maybe a 7 at most out of 10.  The burger was a bit bland.  The toppings and bun were good.  The waitress said they sell about 500 a day. Wow.  At 15.99 each that's good for them.  
They don't have appetizers on the menu.  We shared Korean chicken ribs which were good and very spicy.   We also shared a beet salad.   Prices on the high side, portions on the small side. Good beer menu.   It was a good experience and cool spot."}
{"text":"I'm a little late to the party I think. 
Went for the 1/2 price wine and cote de boeuf, the energetic atmosphere and because who hasn't done P&L besides my old dusty ass. When we arrived the place was thrumming for a Thursday. Busy and vibrant and loud.  Not a place for an intimate tete et tete. I liked the glow and vibe a lot! 

The service was steady and on hand for all the questions. Very helpful lady and patient as all get out and my idiosyncratic/fucking annoying questions. 

We ordered the cauliflower  - it was such a bore. I'd had such high hopes and dreams for this dish.  Cauliflower roasted with a gravy and ricotta.  It was void of any flavour beyond the beautiful delicate char on the florets. This was a huge let down. Like me according to my motha. 

The wine list for the half price is limited but OK.  Kinda basic for what they have on offer on the regular menu. 

I do love the layout of the menu, I like that it is arranged by budget. 

Anyway,  I got drunk. Yay me and $42 wine! 

Next up was the mac&cheese. The price is beyond affordable, like free practically which is what I would be paying to eat it again. It was bland incarnate.  Like it's name is Toby,  all his furniture is beige and he kisses with no tongue. Boring carbs are a tragedy.

The 50 Oz cote de boeuf - so ribsteak.
100% must do. It's delicious..takes 40 mins to prepare. It's marbled, it's fatty, it's tender, it's sweet, it's salty, it's handsome and suave. 

The shortcake... vomit. No literally it was hard, dense and dumb. It was not a good texture to follow up the glorious beef. Or anything really. I think they accidentally served dry wall? The strawberry compound was insane however and once I finally discovered in lurking under some whipped topping it certainly  improved the dish. But not enough to wish it upon someone I've just met and am mildly interested in forming a nod to each other relationship in passing. 

There was two of us. We managed to eat about 12-14 Oz between us. I just had two days of the most glorious leftovers! :') 

Now despite the underwhelming experience with the sharing plate, the side and dessert,  I cannot wait to come back and try the hot chicken and the extensive and fascinating cocktail list with bespoke drinks, which the bartender and waitress hella delivered! It was exact to my dates pallette. EXACTLY what I had asked for! Ginger, sweet without lingering and earthy without smoke. LIKE THERE IS BLACK MAGIC HAPPENING HERE! Someone summon the Pope to exorcise this drink maker!  It was too good to be human made. Just saying. 

And maybe check out the dance hall beneath the dining ..."}
{"text":"So the burger is good here, but thats about it. If your into communal dining with randoms as seems to be the trend lately in toronto heres another one for you. I came with one other person for a burger and it was decent. Later a friend hosted her birthday here with a party of 14 people. We had pre arranged a set menu with a number of their menu items (not the burgers) such as the brocollini dish, the carrot dish, the beets, the corn, brocolli and cheese, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, collared greens, the cauliflower dish, the sliced beef, and the fried chicken (in other words probably about 60 percent of the menu). Apart from the fried chicken which was pretty good everything else was mediocre at best. The most disappointing part though was the manner and quality of service. The waiters were friendly enough but our meal took over three and a half hours to serve, we were never given dinner plates and had the entire meal on tiny appetizer plates. Perhaps worst of all in true communal fashion the food was served in large bowl like portions but disgustingly no serving spoons were provided. Essentially dishes were being passed between all 14 people (some perfect strangers) with only their own used silverware to dish out their own helpings onto a measily appetizer plate. Needless to say all of my friends at the party got sick afterward with stomach issues. I dont care how good your burger is, I will never go back."}
{"text":"If I can start consuming and digesting ambiance and decor, Parts and Labour would be rated pretty well especially when I enjoyed those Suspension Spring Coil Stools at the bar area. It's like those spring ducks & horses at the kids playground but these ones are for adult. The Fire Hydrant Lamps work well for the bar while the mood Fluorescent tube lighting at the dining area makes it feel like you're in a Garage. 

Unfortunately I haven't developed the ability to absorb atmosphere yet, but I have properly developed an iron-stomach to keep down the half undercooked Roasted Bone Marrow of the Roasted Bone Marrow White Bean Crostini Herb Salad($14.00). The environment was too dark for me to see the actual meal itself so how I determined that was the lingering overwhelming AFTERTASTE. 

Roasted Pork Belly Seared Scallop Charred Scallions Grated Foie Gras White Onion Apple Smear Star Anise ($16.00). The Pork Belly is a reminder of Lechon/Chinese BBQ Pork that has a good crackling crisp skin but less of the savoury flavour than BBQ Pork. Along with Scallop and Charred Scallion, it turned out to be a near passing grade of an Appetizer.  Didn't even realize Foie was there.

The Candy Plate($12.00) Dessert, I would have been happy with a couple of the Caramelized Marshmallow(yum) and the Chocolate Mint then charge me $4.50 at most. The Candied Orange Peel, Chocolate Toffee, Shortbread could have been left out. 

The service was a bit hard to judge at this encounter as it was your average service however our Waitress seemed to be a clean freak and kept coming back to clean our table multiple times which was kind of disruptive in my view and when she was cleaning, my face was literally inches away from the plate on her hand as she moved side to side.  Depending on your clean table factor, you might like this style more than I."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Parts and Labour for my going away party. 

Had to write a review and tell everyone how FABULOUS this place is. It's not pretentious or stuffy, just a bunch of cool people having fantastic food. It was packed! Service was amazing. Our waitress was funny and easy-going, which is rare for a party of 18! The menu can be a little scary to some who don't know what the items are, but I assure you, it is all DELICIOUS. Everyone loved the food. Decor is different, and really makes the place feel hip and comfortable. 

Hands down, one of the best dining experiences I have had. Loved it. Please check it out. You will love it I promise!"}
{"text":"I generally hate going for Tapas and restaurants with \"shared plates\" as I don't like sharing food, but I am trying. I went with 3 girlfriends (1 vegetarian.) 

I am by NO means a picky eater, and generally like or will at least try anything. I sadly did not have the best experience at P&L and probably will not return.

The Menu is seperated into 3 sections:

Vegetables, Seafood, & Meat. Here is what we ordered:

Vegetables:

Roasted Cauliflower - honestly just okay. It served it's purpose as a veggie dish I guess.

Squash Risotto - Sweet tasting. Wasn't really like any risotto I've had before, it almost had the same consistency as oatmeal or porridge. Obviously not the best for sharing.

Seafood:

Seared scallops - this is a $15 dish that comes with THREE marinated scallops. They were actually quite good, and probably one of my favourite things I ate. But I generally like to eat more than one. Especially when they are not particularly large.

Meat:

Buffalo Duck Confit - Another tasty dish. The blue cheese complimented the buffalo style sauce. Only problem - again listed as a \"shared plate\" this piece of duck was tiny. I find it difficult to share things you have to cut off the bone. Even if one person ordered this as a solo dish, it still would have been small.

Fried Sticky Pig Tail - The jalapeño & hoisin sauce was tasty. There was a lot of fat on this dish, but it was on the bigger side. This was the last dish that came, so I don't know if that's why I didn't love this, but I didn't - can't really pin point why. 

Pork Belly and Mashed - The piece of pork belly is pretty big in comparison to every other dish we ordered. But there is an inch layer of fat that sits underneath the pork. There are barely any mashed on the plate, but they're mixed with a tasty gravy type sauce that was very good. 

Flat Iron Steak - I am a BIG fan of all steak (have been my whole life.) I have yet to really ordered a steak that I didn't like. I was hesitant on ordering the steak here to begin with, but the friends I was with were very insistent. We ordered it medium rare. When it arrived, it actually looked like it would be good. We each took a piece, and immediately wanted to spit out our bites. I don't know if it was too \"gamey\" paired with the bitter sauce or marinate. But we actually sent it back. The waitress explained that this is how \"flat iron steak generally tastes.\" Maybe at P&L. 

Oh well, you live and you learn. On the plus side, our server was generally very sweet and informative. The restaurant has a trendy vibe and was pretty packed on a Saturday. 

Also - they only have long tables of 10. So if you don't like eating your dinner sandwiched between total strangers at communal tables, then this place probably isn't for you.

I do have to give a shout out to the dessert: The Country Festival Super Doughnut. It is as good as it sounds. I was actually happy I still had room for dessert (which is a rarity for me) because this thing was incredible. GREAT dessert, If only P&L could step up their food game......

Our feelings were unanimous. We will probably not return here for dinner."}
{"text":"Bold statement: I've found my Hogtown brunch spot. I actually might want to stay at the Gladstone again and again, for more excuses to dine here. 

I felt like I had stepped through a cross continent portal, and landed all the way in Portland, complete with the meal I ordered. Awarded the healthiest dish on the menu (by me), my brunch included pickled carrots, smoked trout, boiled creamer taters, salad and a soft boiled egg. 

The large communal tables make for good company creating, service is sweet and the green iced tea - now that's a treat, served up in a mason jar. Oh, and at 11:30 on a Sunday morning? Heaps of room at the tables!"}
{"text":"Honestly, it was perfect. Food was delicious, portions were appropriate. Service was casual but attentive. Really enjoyed it and will be back"}
{"text":"I've been twice now and the 1st time was amazing - the 2nd was good. Try the Elk if its on the menu and opt for one of the desserts. Love the interior and killer bar."}
{"text":"The one star is based on the burger I ordered. My friends raved and raved about how amazing their burgers are, so perhaps my expectations were high but....it was nothing special! I'm pretty sure I've had a better burger at A&W!
It was overpriced for the quantity of the dishes. 
Cool setup with communal tables."}
{"text":"Being from the U.S. I only eat my burgers medium rare.  When I first moved back to Ontario I was in search of the best burger in the city.  My friend who is a Chef himself suggested we try Parts and Labor. Let me tell you Chef Matty designed a miracle of food greatness! They grind their beef right in-house and that is the reason they can serve their burgers below the med well standard across Ontario.  This place is located in Parkdale but I would make the trip for the west end any day! I cannot speak to the other menu items, but if you consider yourself a burger lover you cannot find a better burger in TO. Special note on Wednesday night they do a burger and a beer for 15/20$!"}
{"text":"I went to Parts & Labour for the first time last week after my boyfriend heard about it...

We just had the address for the place and didn't realize it was an old Pro Hardware store converted into a restaurant/lounge/bar.  We missed it the first time going by.

The decor is simple and slick with lots of community tables and a large bar.  I had the Sea bass carpaccio to start which was served with yummy radishes, green onions and an amazing drizzle sauce.  My BF had their warm salad which was a special that day and all the veggies are locally grown and/or from their roof-top garden.  It was delicious.

For my entree I had the Horse Tenderloin.  I was skeptical at first as I have never had horse before but my BF encouraged me to give it a go.  I must say I was so surprised at how amazing and tender it was.  First of all, it was served on a huge cutting board that I almost wanted to steal for my own use at home, but the meat was cooked to perfection, medium-rate, juicy and just melted in my mouth.  The portion size was just perfect for me and it came with some aparagus, mashed potato and bone marrow which I gave to my BF to suck on.  My BF had the Cornish Hen which was very good as well but I think he had food envy when it came to the horse.

I encourage anyone to check this place out it's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, but the vibe was wrong for me. And in a place where you're sitting at long tables, sharing with strangers, the vibe is important.

By vibe, I don't mean decor. The decor was cool. Very similar to Oddfellows, which makes sense, same owners and designers. Hip, big and industrial looking.

I feel like they are catering to a young, naive crowd who don't eat out much besides chain restaurants, and need a lot of education about the menu and what's on it. I don't know why this bothered me - maybe the proximity to others in the restaurant? Everyone around us was in awe of someone's order of bone marrow. It did look very good, but these people were in awe because they'd never seen it before. I also heard a girl call the rabbit special \"duck\". Same difference? Tastes like chicken?

So, go, enjoy the food. It's delicious, fresh and they do interesting things with it. I definitely would go back, but I'd try to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in their Winterlicous menu. Their brussels sprouts consisted of 5-6 leaves of one. It was laughable. The flavours were good but small portions and miserable wait staff"}
{"text":"I made reservations for 2 using urbanspoon for the restaurant at 6PM after hearing good things about their food. Arrived at 6 PM and the restaurant doors did not open. There were no staff at the door nor any indication as to why they would not open on time.  Made two phone calls and got sent to voice-mail. There was another couple that was waiting outside with us that was also perplexed as to why they would not open. At 6:07 PM with the doors not open we decided to take our business elsewhere. Got a call about the reservation at 6:20 PM but by then was at a different restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to Parts and Labour both for dinner and for the night life while crawling Queen West with friends. We quite enjoyed the funky vibrations the dj was spinning - they make you wanna shake your tail feather!  They also have a club in the basement which has a cover charge - but we never ventured that far.

The old hardware store atmosphere is really trendy and has a great vibe... for night life... but the beer hall tables were not much of a setting for a romantic dinner though.  In my humble opinion, the prices were not reflected in the quality nor the portions of the food; though the service was great, my food was mildly flavored and not served hot."}
{"text":"Best meal in Toronto. Perfectly proportioned food, well balanced, 10/10 light fixtures, efficient service. I would come back here every night if I could. FUCKING GOOOOK"}
{"text":"Great Mac and cheese but everything else was pretty disappointing. We had the fried chicken and the p&l burger - nothing that knocked out socks off lol. It was pretty expensive for a simple meal. Service was very nice and attentive though :)"}
{"text":"This review is for The Shop under Parts & Labour.

What is it about Britpop that makes my ears perk up when I find out there's a Britpop night in town? Is it the sensibilities of Steven Patrick Morrissey? Robert Smith? Ian Curtis? Or the brash, cocky attitude of  Damon Alburn? Jarvis Cocker. Is it the nostalgia of my teenage years? The snotty arrogance of my univ years? A sense that my music is better than your music? Maybe having a laugh at who I was.  All I know is that I definitely love Pulp and anytime I find out there's a Britpop night, I tend to go out.

The place picks up at 11:30pm and for one glorious hour, they will play Pulp and New Order and Morrissey and The Smiths and Happy Mondays. But they will also play other music, which surprise, I don't recognize. But it's still alternative. The truth is that the music is fantastic till last call. The sound system is very loud and I noticed they kept fidgeting with the sound level - it went from audible to ear canal destroying loud.

The crowd who was present that night: Hipsters and nerds. You are safe here. You will be left alone. The perfect ending would be to play How Soon is Now as you are gloriously dancing & turning in one spot."}
{"text":"if you absolutely love brunch but have a breakfast type brunch hating boyfriend like mine, you need to come here . its true . with hoof cafe closed, this is the best brunch place of its kind .

i didnt give it a full 5 stars however, cuz of 2 reasons . ONE . communal table . this isnt really something to complain about, its just my personal preference . i DO like, actually more than like, communal tables at coffee shops . but for a sit down meal, no . i like my table space when eating . plus, i dont like feeling like im being staring at as i stuff myself silly . it makes me feel like a slob . TWO . im pretty small, 5'2\" tall, weighing 105lbs, but when i looked at my bf's order, i thought there wasnt enough food, even for myself . there isnt enough food on the plate !! he actually ended up getting a burger afterwards . :|

so i ordered the P&L porkbelly pancake dish & the bf got the trout . mine was unbelievably delish ! pancake was soo fluffy, pork belly had the perfect amount of fat w the perfect crispiness of the skin and the egg was cooked just .. perfect . all the items on the plate went together so well . i wanted to go to the kitchen, convince the chef he needs to come w me, take him home, lock him up in my basement so he can live w me and make me brunch everyday :) my boyfriend's dish HOWEVER, while being absolutely delish as well, it was wayyyy too small . he said it was like having sex but not finishing . it was a complete tease . haha the amount of fish was smaller than the half of my tiny fist . the rest were just salad, hard boiled egg & little pieces of little pickled radishes . as im looking at the menu online right now, i just noticed they forgot to give him a toast too . boo :( 

i'll be back, but definitely will be avoiding the trout ."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for an evening out. The restaurant was somewhat busy when we arrived at about 8. Unfortunately, busy or not we were in for a slow service night. It was nearly 30 minutes until we got our first round of drinks - 10 minutes for someone to take our order and 20 to bring them. 

The food was quite good. The vegetable dishes were creatively cooked and fresh. The \"pork & beans\", tartare and burger were all perfectly composed and delicious. PnL claims to have the best burger in the city but it doesn't hold a candle to the Queen & Beaver, in my opinion. The cheesecake doughnut was over the top - I can admire the gluttony of it even if it wasn't really my thing. 

The slow, indifferent service continued for the duration of the meal with items missing from the order and long waits for food. Ultimately, the good food doesn't outweigh the spotty service. I really did want to like PnL but I can't see myself going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I just swung in for an appetizer and a couple of beers. The roasted cauliflower was pretty simple, but tasty. I enjoyed the tube light fixtures and other small fixtures around the bar. It was a cozy spot to hang out for a few hours."}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious. Went here for my birthday dinner while visiting Toronto. We split the Nashville chicken and the burger. I would travel back for the burger, no question. The seating concept is cool (big, long tables that you share with other parties) and I love the decor. Gets a little loud later in the evening which is a drawback if you're just there for dinner, but I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My review is for Sunday brunch. I'd had this on my restaurant wish list for awhile now. 

Pros:
-the Caesar. It hit the spot 
-plating and appearance of food
-the French fries
-communal tables- I actually didn't mind this, was kind of fun

Cons:
-not as many options as I'd like 
-it was really cold in there 

Food was not amazing but not overly disappointing either. I don't think I'd go back though."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night for a family dinner - there were six of us, and we had one of the long communal tables to ourselves. I had made a reservation, but the restaurant was basically empty when we arrived for dinner at 7:30. 

Our server, Emma, was incredibly friendly and let us know about all the specials and guided us through the wine and cocktail offerings. She made honest suggestions, which I always feel is more genuine than servers who just say they like everything. 

What I especially appreciated was that she spent time with me going through the entire menu to point out what was gluten free, or what could be made gluten free. Per her advice, I ordered the trout with roasted beets. It was absolutely stunning. Bright and bursting sweetness from the beets, verdant green from leaves and herbs, and luscious silkiness from the creme fraiche. I also stole a few bites of the steak tartare served with Old Bay potato chips. It was well seasoned - and the perfect portion for a shared app or a light main.

Other dishes our group ordered were the roasted cauliflower (which was deemed to be too bland), and the signature P&L burger - delicious but for larger appetites!

The highlight of the night was when the kitchen whipped up a custom gluten free dessert for our table. The banana splits were a naughty retro indulgence, and had us all rolling our eyes in delight - they should put these on the menu permanently!

Thanks for helping make this family dinner a success P&L and Emma in particular - we'll be back for more banana splits!"}
{"text":"We only came in for dessert and drinks. The cherry cheesecake donut was really delicious. The small is more than enough to feed 4 people."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for two tonight and really enjoyed the atmosphere within the restaurant and the food. We were welcomed and seated immediately. I loved how this restaurant wasn't located in the core of the city and had a more mature crowd. We ordered fried chicken,  three sides (wedges,  mac and cheese and mushrooms) and beef tartare to start. The beef tartare was delicious and accompanied with some fresh cut chips. The saltiness from the chips accompanied the tartare really well. The fried chicken portion was huge - more than two people can eat but totally worth it. The skin was crunchy and the meat,  oh so juicy. The wedges had were crispy and had a lovely butter flavor. It almost tasted like there was butter poured over the fresh cut fries. Oh my goodness! The mac and cheese had a Cheetos topping and was so creamy & cheesy. The mushrooms were seasoned well and there was a good assortment. The service was attentive and they had many drink options - cocktails,  wine to different beers on tap. Overall, great ambiance and loved the crowd. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"We went as a group of 30 and they sat us up front. Everyone all night had to walk through us. A few of us ordered food -- which frankly was not that impressive. I think I had heard great things and expected more. P&L is a nifty spot in a dour neighbourhood that is undergoing a renaissance. P&L is part of the reason and the crowd was certainly hip and beautiful, but the service and food were just plain ok."}
{"text":"This is a really cool looking place. Modern, hip, trendy, kinda industrial chic. I can see this place taking on a whole different ambiance at night, with its large bar and very large wine, beer, and cocktail menu. Our server said they also have a club space downstairs with music and dancing in the evenings.

I had the pleasure of having brunch with three friends this morning and we were more than satisfied with everything we had.

Fried Chicken with grits, collard greens, fried egg. The chicken was crispy and moist. Everything was seasoned just right.

P&L Burger with bacon onion jam, Monterey Jack cheese, dill mayo, iceberg lettuce, egg bun. My friend wasn't thrilled with this but he also ordered one of the most boring things on the menu. It looked good to me.

Flank steak & Eggs with fried green tomato, kale salsa verde and salad. Nicely cooked medium-rare steak. Very crispy fried green tomatoes. Flavourful salsa verde.

Pancakes with pork belly and egg. This was the dish of the day, very well balanced flavours and nice smoky flavour on the pork belly. I would order this for myself next time.

The food and service were awesome! Sadly it's quite a trek from home but I would certainly consider going back, even just for the pancakes and pork belly."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night. Upon entering.. it was spacious and the staff are friendly and very helpful. But i thoroughly enjoyed \"the Shop\" which is under Parts and Labour (same floor as the washrooms)... it's a really awesome club section. It was most like a basement and very different from the top floor. The music was awesome! Everyone was dancing..but it was very very cramped. that is just one complaint..but at the end of the day: everyone was having a good time. I would go here again! Really fun place"}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a few friends while visiting Toronto. The place has a cool atmosphere and the decorations are nice. The food is just okay; some of it was cold/still frozen on the inside, which was disappointing given the price. Overall, it isn't bad, but certainly not somewhere I'd go out of my way to try again."}
{"text":"If you have someone to share it with, get the Lemon Curd Creme Brûlée! If you try it alone you might go into a sweet/pleasure coma!"}
{"text":"As a heads up, the service is quite slow here. I've been here a total of two times, the first time was specifically to try the burger since I've heard such raging reviews about it and I gotta say, it was a pretty damn good burger. The best one I've had in toronto so far! The bread was so soft and blended in so nicely with the burger. 

The second time, I came for the fried chicken night for two at $26. My biggest weakness - fried chicken. But it didn't really meet expectations imo. The chicken was decent quality but I prefer my fried chicken more crispy. The portions was also quite small (similar to the burger), I feel like it was good for about 1.5 people not 2. 

Overall, decent place and def will be coming back for that burger!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  We walked in without a reservation-- staff greeted and seated us.  The cocktail menu was complicated and probably admirable for those that partake.  Our server helped us navigate the menu so that we had enough to share and entrees of our own.  Because we dine with cute kids with foodie in training staff thru in an extra mac n' cheese (thank you).  I tasted a lot, but what's worth noting-- the broccolli and trout both creatively seasoned and to die for.  Next time we are in town... we will check in again."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner with my brother- didn't realize it was Summerlicious. Surprise! Tasty  three course for $38. Classic mixed drinks, as well as some very ingenious creations. I tried the Ginger Brown - not very gingery, but very tasty. Recommend perusing the drink options. The dishes were tasty - the Cornish hen would have been better accompanied by some potatoes but was good nonetheless. Definitely try the burger and the Mac and Cheese (topped with crumbled Cheetos). We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service was great! The drinks were delicious and really unique. The menu itself is great and everything was cooked to perfection. We had the pork belly, squid, mac and cheese... we couldn't believe how good it all was. I can't wait to go back! 

The music was a little loud at the end of our dinner with the night club downstairs. But if your dinner doesn't go too late then it shouldn't be a problem."}
{"text":"I came in for Fried Chicken Tuesdays - 2 can dine for $26.00.  I was worried it might be packed, and with family style tables that can be a problem.  Especially when you have a baby with you.

But there was nothing to fear.  There was lots of space in the restaurant.  We had the whole long table to ourselves, and a couple of friends.  And our baby.  

There are no highchairs here, but there are infant seats with a three-point-harness that can be attached to a chair.  At the end of the day, it's pretty much the same thing.  Your child will be safe, secure, and sitting at eye level.

The chicken was some of the best I've had - and it was the first time I didn't just let my wife take all the skin.  That's how I knew it was superb.  

I'm not sure I'd go back on Chicken day again - but if anyone is headed there for Burger and Pint Wednesdays ($18.00) sign me up!"}
{"text":"I have been talking about going here since I moved to parkdale. It was worth it! 

I went with a girl friend and it was summerlicious; so there was a fixed menu or they had their famous burger options. We both ate at off the summerlicious menu. Great sized portions, healthy options, vegetarian friendly - we were thrilled. 

Everything we ate was delicious, wine choices were perfect, servers were very attentive and friendly. 

The only thing keeping it off the 5 star status is the super loud music. Made it hard to hear my friend across the table. Since it's communal tables, everyone is focused on themselves."}
{"text":"Well.  Sorry folks. Came from US, and feel disappointed and actually ripped off.  Their definition of Nashville hot chicken is;  3 small pieces of chicken, on top of a 10 cent piece of white bread, with cheap red hot sauce on the side.  Total $37 including the sweetest (yuck) iced tea ever.  Run away !!!  Also, incredibly horrifying neighborhood, watch yourself here.  Don't go, I know you are stylishly decorated and a hipster hangout, but please.  You will not last long, then onto the next trend.  You will make fine $$ I. This run, by deception, but what comes around, goes around.  Be careful"}
{"text":"We had supper this evening at Parts & Labour.  We got there at 6pm when they opened.  When we left a couple hours later, the place was crowded.

Gord and Simone ordered the P&L Burger ... Gord got his with a Caesar Salad and Simone got hers with fries.  The burger looked really good and they said it was.  They both said they'd get it again.

Steve ordered Trout and he said it was delicious and he'd get it again.  Steve also ordered a side of  Mac & Cheese with Cheetos.  We all agreed that it was fun to try but just okay.

I ordered the Roasted Hen without the mushrooms and onions.  There was a lot of hen and it was delicious.  The hen was really tender, the chicken sauce was good and the potatoes were tasty.  I'd definitely get it again.

Simone ordered Lemon Curd Cheese Cake Brûlée for dessert.  It was interesting.  I had a taste and it was very lemony.

Emma was our server and she took good care of us.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and with Summerlicious going on I thought it was a perfect opportunity to try this place out, I heard great things.
Going out for dinner is a privilege for me and by the way we were served, it seemed like they were doing us a favor. It was never clear who our waiter was and they were generally disinterested in our experience. Another annoyance was when we were waiting for our food our supposed waitress sees a friend and gives huge scream when she sees her and has a full conversation in front of our table - totally unprofessional in my opinion. 

The food was average. I had the steak and have had much better at other places. Their homemade salad was the best part of the night, if you could believe. 

Another major turnoff was that the waiter didn't even say thank you as we left - way to turn me off even more. 

Hopefully they will take the time to reflect on some of their faults but this place is soo pretentious that I really doubt they'll ever have a wake up call until they go under. 

Don't think I'll be going there anytime soom. Many other quality places that are worthy of my business."}
{"text":"Finally ate here last week. 
I have to say, the food is good, rich, interesting and definitely has a black hoof style to it.

I don't think it's the best food i've ever had, but for the prices and the menu it's worth it. I just wish the portions were slightly bigger."}
{"text":"So to preface this review we traveled long and far because we love  Matty's  videos on YouTube. He is both entertaining and sufficiently odd to bring a new perspective on cooking and  restaurant life. We pulled in after a long drive from Montreal. Waiter was helpful and on the ball. The food was fair at best.  This is the hardest review we have written in sometime. My wife and I really wanted to love this restaurant because of our affection for an appreciation of  Matty's work.  The burgers were very good. Kids love them. The main entrées consisted of the salmon and the lamb.   Both were just ok.  The lamb chops were underseasoned and undercooked. The rest of the dish barely held together. The salmon was passable. Bummer that we  left feeling disappointed. Maybe you'll have a different experience?"}
{"text":"I've been to P&L a few times now, and believe me when I tell you it truly shines when you go with a large group and eat family style, off of the fixed menus. I recently celebrated a birthday there with 12 of the guys, and everyone was very pleased and VERY full. The food is straightforward, well-executed, and shows quality. My standouts include the fried chicken, ceviche and Côte de boeuf. Impressive cocktail list, and a pretty cool vibe downstairs if you wanna hang out and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant since it opened. With a constantly evolving menu coming here is never a bore - and always delicious. Welcoming staff and great atmosphere. 

For brunch: the pancakes and korean chicken - your mouth will thank you. 
For dinner: on the current menu the veal shank will melt in your mouth, the burg for first timers, and whatever variation of beef tartare is available."}
{"text":"Having gone straight downstairs to the basement dance floor every time prior, we finally set a date and made a reservation to have dinner at Parts & Labour one night. Passing by the atmospherically dim and buzzing main dining room with the communal tables, we were pleasantly surprised to find that we were to be seated in the much better lit and action-packed back room. Maybe it was just the table d'hote-like atmosphere and warm service from the owners that we got from being seated kitchen-side, but this was one great dining experience.  

My juicy medium rare flatiron steak was cooked to bloody perfection and sat on a large bed of golden crispy fries. My dinner companions all reported their meals to be delicious too. Water and wine refills were made before the bottoms of glasses could be seen and service checks were made frequently via smiles, nods, and small talk.  

I've heard great things about some of their other dishes (namely, their burger) and look forward to going back on another night when I'll be able to slip away into a dreamy food coma after dinner instead of having to further fill myself with drinks and dance for the rest of the night (not that I'm complaining about dancing, just dancing with an overly full stomach)."}
{"text":"Bias disclaimer: I'm a pretty big fan of Matty Matheson based on his shows on Viceland. Ok, now let me separate that because if the food here sucked I'd still like his shows, but I would just know his recipes are shit. That wasn't the case. I enjoyed everything we ordered. 

We started with the roasted cauliflower and it was pretty good. Our main dish was the Nashville Hot Chicken with a side of the macaroni and cheese. Ok, I'm a macaroni and cheese snob and I can not do that blue box stuff that so many people adore. It's always baked macaroni n cheese on mine so it's always like a dice roll for me to order macaroni n cheese unless I'm at a Soul Food joint. However, this macaroni n cheese was pretty good. It was super cheesy and there were cheetos on top so I don't really understand how you can go wrong here. Now, the Nashville Hot Chicken should be called Nashville-Your-Lips-Will-Burn-Why-Didn't-They-Also Bring-Out-Milk-Chicken cuz it was hot as hell. It was delicious but it was also hot. I mean, the bread and butter pickles they put on top of the chicken was even hot as fire and I would have thought they would have provided some relief. Nah, those pickles were assholes for sure. So, if you don't like heat do not order this dish.

I had the Azakusa cocktail and it was ok. 

I see a lot of reviews where people say the service is really slow. Maybe it's just me but I feel like the service was particularly slower than what I'm used to all over Toronto, not just here."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of great things about this place I finally decided to give it a try. This was an extremely memorable experience proving that it is literally all HYPE. I don't understand how this restaurant has so many great reviews... My first issue is that this place can't decide whether they are a greasy spoon or a high end restaurant?
The only thing on the menu worth even looking at is the P&L burger which is what the waiter recommended to everyone. A glorified burger and fries for 18 dollars. This burger was SO greasy and had zero flavour. On top of that my six friends and I waited for half an hour to get our food. 
My boyfriend got the hot chicken.. 3 pieces of chicken with a slice of WONDERBREAD 21 dollars.. Let me guess is the chicken organic anti-biotic free? Oh and no fries ? Cool.  
Octopus was charred and tasted like rubber.... 
The kicker to this meal was the side of fries that cost 8 dollars.. Yes 8 dollar fries which had a very similar appearance and taste as mccains super fries. 
Save your time and money and go elsewhere because this restaurant SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just finishing up a meal at P&L. Could not be more disappointed. Ordered the fried chicken family style Tuesday special with mac n cheese and roasted carrots. The white meat chicken was overcooked, dry and non-descript flavor-wise and the mac n cheese tasted like the boxed stuff. Oddly, the meal for two came with 5 pieces of chicken. The only saving grace were the roasted carrots which were rich, sweet, and just tangy enough. Service was ok, though not great."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Lisa and the gang were amazing. Good vibes. Food was tops."}
{"text":"We came here a couple months ago for dinner, as we just moved to the neighbourhood. Previously, we had eaten burgers at their other location, P&L Burger, and loved them! So we figured we'd try the burger at Parts & Labour... 

I guess because we had such high expectations, we were inevitably let down. The seasoning on the meat or something just didn't taste right. And the bun was grease soaked and soggy. Service was slow, overall disappointing. 

Tonight, we decided to give them a chance to change our minds, stopping by for dessert only. We were informed that they had two dessert items: a banana split donut, and a strawberry shortcake. We ordered one of each to share. The banana split donut wasn't bad, though it was extremely greasy. The strawberry shortcake however, was awful. Basically they stack two tea biscuits atop one another, and top it with whipped cream and some strawberry slices, with some creamy strawberry sauce on the side. These tea biscuits were so dense, and disgustingly salty - they were inedible. The server came back and had noticed we had only had two small bites of the shortcake and asked why. I explained it to him, and though he did apologize, he did not remove the item from the bill - I was surprised. The bill was just under $30, which would have been fine if the food was worth it. But it definitely was not. Too bad, they're only half a block from our house. We definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"The service was great.  My boyfriend And I heard lots of Great thing about this restaurant and been told this is the best burger in toronto. We were there for the winterlious unexpectly.  We ordered the calamari and the cauliflower as appetizers. The cauliflower is great but the calamari was a bit disappointed. The calamari has been tenderized too much by baking soda. Then we both ordered the burger as main course.  The patty and the choice of bun was great.  However, it needs a bit of crunchy / texture to make it more interesting.  Also we find the burger is a bit brended. Mayo and cheese are both similar taste profile so some spicy or sour will help a lot.  For dessert, we ordered lemon Ice cream and creme burlee. Lemon was fantastic but the cream burlee was a bit pastesy."}
{"text":"I've been to the P&L Burger joint, but wanted to come to try this place out as soon as I found out they have a restaurant which serves more than just burger. The place is dark and service is honestly slow. But the food was good and tasty. Portions vs pricing, it is overall quite an expensive restaurant. 
The beet salad was sweet and almost a beautiful culinary dish on its own. I ordered the rainbow trout wanting to try something different and the only disappointment was the portion of the trout. The taste and fish was well cooked with great taste of dill oil, creme fraiche, salt roasted beets, cured cucumbers and horseradish combination. The cocktails menu was robust and a good wine selection to go with your meal. If you want a safe choice, better go for the Burger. You can't go wrong with ordering a burger at P&L.
In the winter when it's cold enough, they even make the cider on the heated wood burning stove that keeps ppl warm at the front of the restaurant. Cool!"}
{"text":"Amazing culinary experience . Great service!"}
{"text":"From the service to the mac and cheese, everything at Parts and Labour was absolutely wonderful and very much affordable. At $50 pp after tax and tip, we enjoyed a glass of wine and a scotch, the Dan Dan noodles, the cauliflower, the steak tartare (our favorite by far) and last but not least, the mac and cheese. 

It was a great meal, in a great atmosphere. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would go back here 10 more times and have the Korean fried chicken. A hearty bowl of rice, sweet pickled carrot, fried egg and crispy chicken with sesame seeds."}
{"text":"Foodnetwork you screwed them.

this is how this is going down...
5 stars for seating me super quickly in a relatively cool cummunal table with decent eatign companions around us.
-1 point for taking forever to bring us out a burger. yes just 1 burger.
-1 point for the burger smelling like frozen meat
-1 point for it tasting like a bigmac
+1 point for havign a cider on tap
-1 point for tryign to proudly proclaim this as \"Toronto's best burger\"

a lie! a total lie! This burger was atrocious. a disgrace to real burgers. and seriously why did it smell so bad??? ugh.

total 2 points. for quick seating and cider on tap.
Do with that what you will."}
{"text":"I first heard of Parts & Labour when I picked up a Now magazine last month; on the cover was a picture of the Social's Richard Lambert (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-social-toronto) and OddFellow's Jesse Girard (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/oddfellows-toronto). This bar/restaurant/Live venue hybrid had just opened in May and I was surprised to see that it had no revue...

I was curious to see how an old hardware store would be converted in the holy trinity of social gatherings (music, food, drinks), so I rounded up a little group of friends and headed over to Parts & Labour on a Wednesday night around midnight. Maybe it was because the next day was a holiday or maybe this place has managed to find a niche in Parkdale, either way this place was packed!

There was no cover and we sat by the bar and I were immediately greeted by a super sweet \"Tall Paul Bunyan\" type bartender. Things didn't start off so hot when he told me they didn't carry Malibu Rum... he did apologize a few times and offered alternatives.

As I waited for my friends to drizzle in, I got a chance to look around. There are long communal table against one wall for dinning, a small cafeteria area in the back and semi-truck suspension springs as seats at the bar. The music was definitely cranked at 13 and made it challenging to have a conversation. They played whole albums ranging from Nirvana to The Sonics.

Although the kitchen was closed, I took a look at the menu and I am not going to lie, it looked both frightening and intriguing. Lamb heart tartar, fried pig face, horse tongue sandwich, ect...

Will I go back? Probably and I definitely want to give the food a try or check out a concert in \"The Shop\" downstairs."}
{"text":"Drinks- 4 stars
Love the cocktail menu. Good selections and every single ingredients in the mix are listed.
The Pimms Cup ($10) I ordered is delicious and refreshing. There are dices of fresh fruits: orange, strawsberry, blueberrys and cucumber slice, mixed with  Pimms #1 which gives a hint of spice and critus. Really fruity indeed but not sweet, my kind of drink!

Deco - 3.5 stars
Great open space. Interesting decorations: reuse of hardware items. The only thing I have to complain is the lighting. It got really so dim and all the food they serve just looks like dark/brown in colour.. (maybe it is good that I did not realize what I was eating!) 

Services - 2 stars
The \"Please Leave Me Alone\" hostess in the front was really laid back. When I told her we just have something light, she said oh just sit at the bar. I found the bar seatings not too comfy, I really cannot be bouncing up and down and have a drink that will make me sick. Finally, we got moved to a communal table. The place is half emptied, I really don't see the problem.

Food - 1.5 stars
The menu is interesting but really you really do need to make them taste good with the prices you are charging. Since with the dim lighting, customers cannot see the presentation.. and even if it is nicely presented but it does not taste good. 
The Roasted bone marrow was so undercook, it is practically raw inside...  that taste is so overwhelming sickening.  Unluckily I have the one served at Black Hoof if not I will never ever eat this again in my life.
The other dish we ordered were average, not really worth the price they are charging!

I would have give 4 stars if I just rating Parts and Labour as a bar and on the drinks alone... But their food menu left me so disappointed. This place have great potential just ned to work on improving on the quality of their food!

They accepts all credit cards."}
{"text":"Saw this gem featured on Vice ! 
Had the burgers and they were dynamite. I definitely recommend a go ;)"}
{"text":"I was here more than a year ago and really liked my dinner there.
I was here again a week ago for a birthday party and I was really disappointed.
First with the restaurant itself: It's a nice typical trendy hipster décor with funky hanging light fixtures everywhere, vintage/industrial looking furniture, subway tiles on the walls and a neat open kitchen area in the back. Most of the restaurant has long tables ideal for large groups. With all the hard surfaces the place gets really noisy, not just from the music but from other tables.

I was on a cleanse so I couldn't drink and couldn't eat a full meal and was limited to certain foods. I asked the waitress what kind of non-alcoholic drinks they have as they didn't have a beverage menu and I didn't feel like having pop or tap water that was on the table. She mentioned a selection of sparkling water, which I said I just wanted a San Pellegrino with lime. She said if I wanted a lime flavoured San P, which I didn't know exists, but I just said I wanted just a San P. with a slice of lime. She later returned with a Perrier with a slice of lemon, which I didn't correct her as I didn't wanted to wait again to get another drink.

On to dinner, I only had their scallop crudo, which was raw scallop marinated in a dressing of yuzu, Serrano pepper, mint and finely crushed pistachios. Even though their menu only have three headings: veg, seafood and meat, with no mention of appetizer or small plates I had the feeling that the scallop plate I ordered was an appetizer plate which I was right.
The scallops were reasonably fresh and I really love the marinade dressing which had combinations of great flavours. The bits of toasted pistachios gave it a nice earthiness and texture. 

It seems that meat is the main attraction of Parts & Labour, and everything on their menu sounded really good, however my friends soon discovered that its was a let down. A couple orders of bone marrow plates came to the table, and this was also a appetizer sized dish. It came with a small side of greens and toast which the marrow is meant to be scooped out of the three pieces of bone segments and spread on the toast. Unfortunately the marrow was overcooked and burnt which didn't leave much creamy marrow goodness in the bone.
A few ordered their burger which was undercooked for a burger and lacked seasoning. 

The biggest disappointment was the 45-oz Cote de Beouf which was served family style on a big wooden cutting board with a large side of fries and two kinds of dipping sauces. This plate is meant to serve 4 people. My friends ordered this rare as they like their meat bloody. The plate arrived and only two thirds of the steak is edible, the rest of the meat consists of huge slabs of fat and gristle. I love a good steak and love my steak rare as well, but I was a bit disgusted by massive amounts of fat that were left on my friends' plates after they were done. They were very disappointed especially when the plate was $90 and talked to the waitress about it which the chef soon came to the table to check it out. Everyone liked the fries though.

The chef said that due to this special cut of beef, it needed to be served medium, which was why there was a lot of unrendered fat. We were disappointed that the waitress failed to mentioned this, or even warned us. Most restaurants would recommend the correct wellness for different cuts of meat. I was also surprised that the meat didn't have any marbling and the fat was all on one side of the steak which I wouldn't expect on a good piece of meat.
The chef sounded a bit arrogant in explaining the meat, but luckily he did manage to take it off our tab. 

Overall it wasn't a terrific dining experience, I don't know if they just had an off night or they have been going downhill this past year. I will leave this up to the other Yelpers to decide."}
{"text":"Okay spot. The basement was packed full of people dancing to good music. Drinks are way way overpriced for it to be worth it. Plus $5 cover. Not the best place to go if you just want a few drinks without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Like a lot of reviewers I was drawn by Matty, or rather a friend's love for him. The bartenders and hostesses are so nice at P&L that it pains me to speak ill of the place, but I have to be honest: My meal was disappointing from start to finish. The red wine poured into my glass had turned - I asked for another and it was replaced by another that was also iffy. For my meal I had the broccolini, which was cooked to a nice char and topped off with a tasty egg, but all that goodness was soggy and overwhelmed by too much sauce underneath. The pasta was really disappointing - paper-thin ravioli that was again drowned in a watery sauce. (The mushrooms on top were fab though.)"}
{"text":"Every time I go here, it's pretty empty and I love that.  I had their fancy Country Fried Steak & eggs and I've never been so excited in my whole damn stupid life because it was way better tasting than it looked, and it was a true work of art.  Don't go anywhere else, ever."}
{"text":"We went to P&L with a purpose: to try the Pork belly, and P&L Burger.  

The Pork belly was really good and the sauce was perfect.  
The P&L Burger was requested as recommended (on the menu).  The burger bun was perfect, and the patty was meaty, juicy, tasty and began falling apart during consumption...wow!  Awesome burger!"}
{"text":"Parts & Labour is a must in Toronto cuz Matty Matheson is that dude yo! Sounds like a little hip restaurant, but P&L has some real regal stuff on their menu. Keep in mind that this joint is not for the stingy crackers, it's pretty bougie with desserts in the $12 steakhouse range, definitely word every penny doe. 

Giving a shout-out to my stingy dudes: on Tuesday they have a \"Fried Chicken\" special where 2x can eat for $26. On Wednesday you can get a \"Burger\" + \"Beer\" for $18 - beats ordering a pizza if you ask me."}
{"text":"Go on Wednesday and get the burger and a pint special. Two burg options, choose the cheeseburger. You get fries, pickle and your choice of pint with it for 18 bucks. I love burgers, I've eaten a lot of garbo ones and some of the finest on planet, this one is up there.

Don't mess it up, trolls."}
{"text":"Food was extremely late, we waited a very long time. Waiter came to say 5 minutes but it took another hour. Manager explained that they got busy due to the influx of people. However the place was not full and restaurants should really be prepared for \"at-capacity\" seating. We were there on the 27th at night. The burgers were mostly well when they were supposed to be medium. One of us even received the wrong burger but accepted it anyway cause we were hungry. How can you screw up a burger? It was a glorified McDonalds burger. The lamb was terrible, lacked flavour and the meat wasn't very fresh. Very underwhelming. Food came cold. Waiter offered us desserts on the house to make up for it but even that took a long time and manager explained that we weren't each really getting desserts for free, it was a bit confusing and embarrassing. Just felt the whole experience involved the manager apologizing. Such a disaster. On the other hand, the fries and the donuts were great but it did not make up for the lack of service and the lack of passion and love behind the food. Also, the menu prices are different online vs. in the restaurant and are more expensive by $3. Some items on the website such as the ribs were not even offered. Please update your website! This restaurant was great a few years ago, what happened?"}
{"text":"Im a fan of Matty and I've wanted to try this place for a while now. My fiance and I don't get to go out often as we can rarely afford it, so we try and go to places we hear good things about. I didn't realize P&L changed their menu just a few days ago, which was a bummer because i was excited to try the popular things from their menu like the pork belly pancakes. Still, we were down for the experience regardless. Staff was really nice and attentive, the place has a cool vibe although I'm not a huge fan of the seating.

As for the food, I hate to say it and I don't consider myself a pretentious foodie but we both found the food pretty disappointing. We shared a side of Mac and cheese to start, which is a favorite food of mine. I've seen Matty make this version online... I liked the crushed Cheetos on top but the sauce itself was kind of gummy and lacking a strong cheese flavor. My fiance got the squash risotto. It had nice, layered flavors and she was into it but she said she wouldn't get it again... I had the dan-dan noodles and this bummed me out. Props for home made noodles but the spice was a bit too much for me. This is fine as I'm a bit of a wimp with spice but overall the flavor was just meh... Tons of broth in the bowl that cancelled out the taste of the ground lamb... Overall, I could get a much better version of this at a place like Salad King but for half the price. This was my biggest beef with my experience. The food (except the risotto) was like Jack Astors level quality but at fine dining prices. I dropped $105 for two entrees, two drinks and one side. Maybe I'm poor AF but $15 for a 2oz drink is insane to me. I can see the creativity they put into them and that they hire people who know their shit but even a classic cocktail was pricey... I'd love to have tried more of their drinks but when it's $30 for you and your date to have one drink each, you hit a limit pretty quick. 

Maybe I'm just being priced out of Toronto nightlife, who knows. In the end, we both left still kinda hungry and a day's wage dropped on an experience I don't want to repeat. Since it'll probably be another 3 months before we get to go out for a nice meal again, im a little let down. If the old menu comes back I'll give it another shot as I'm sure there's a reason this place became popular in the first place."}
{"text":"The mac & cheese was spot on, topped with crushed cheetos.  I can neither confirm, nor deny, that I will be using this technique in the future.  Cocktails were bang on, nice selection that should please most.  I opted for the rabbit which, while tasty, was dry and overcooked.  Nicely presented and very flavorful, but I left dinner thinking I should have gone with something else."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Food and service is decent. Table seatings are a little strange. Would recommend this for \"friends catching up\" kind of situation over a date night situation. 

Thursday's are half off cote de beuf AND half off wine bottles - sooo delicious! Our Waiter recommended an Italian wine (in picture) which was in my opinion quite enjoyable and a good pairing."}
