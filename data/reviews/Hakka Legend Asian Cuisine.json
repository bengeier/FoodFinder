{"text":"We had the Bombay Chicken dry , as the all reviews were high for it. And it did turn out the Best Buy and did justice to all the reviews. It was spicy and full of flavours, for a person who started eating chicken recently, this was a good bet . Oh it was a take out,am yet to visit the place."}
{"text":"Worst place! I refuse to go there ever again. The staff as well as the chef i assume is not at all attentive because they gave me a chicken in place of panner.I being a vegetarian making them understand this, was a task as they were adamant and did not understand the sentimental and religious concern.. As we had tried the chicken. The flavours are nowhere close to original hakka and so is the degraded quality."}
{"text":"Stopped by to check this out & compare vs the neighbourhood Hakka mainstay, Federicks.  I was a bit disappointed.  We tried the Chicken 88, Bombay chicken and chicken pakora.  The pakoras tasted a bit greasy / soggy - and I really missed the nice chili sauce they give you at Federick's.  They also really didn't have any definitive spice or flavoring.  They kind of just tasted like the chicken 88 with no sauce.  Chicken 88 - not bad.  I can see why it's their big dish as it was a lot better than the rest of the food.  You could actually taste more than a deep friend nugget. However, I still found the taste of the oil from the deep fryer overpowered the actual dish, peppers, and spices.  Bombay Chicken -- Kind of like a chicken pakora tossed about with some fried onions.  Soggy, mainly tastes of the same overbearing deep fryer oil that dominated the pakoras and that the Chicken 88 struggled to cover.  I think overall just the taste of their chicken / deep fryer oil is what put us off.  Everything else about the restaurant has a lot of potential.  I'm wondering if they are recycling deep fryer oil or using it for too long."}
{"text":"Great Food, service and clean environment. Staff was very friendly. All food reccomendations were appreciated."}
{"text":"Love the food here, chilli chicken and Bombay chicken being my favourites. The wait time is not long even on take outs which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"The service is good the food is good it is so worth the price. The menu has selection and the have a deal on lunch. I like the bombay chicken"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! The hakka noodles are the best! The lunch specials are all really good! Service is quick and polite, food is really good cant beat it for price and quality!"}
{"text":"I have been to their sister location in Scarborough so I was expecting much more from this location. The food took a while to come out and was rather bland. I also found the chicken dishes to be over battered and very soggy. Would rather make the drive to Scarborough."}
{"text":"Good lunch menu at a great price. Portions are adequate and service is usually quick. It can be a bit cold inside (or maybe that's just me)."}
{"text":"Very basic resturant you can find in India at every corner. Apart from that very poor customer service. The only thing that is good is I think the size of portion served"}
{"text":"So many dishes to choose from and the portions are incredibly large.   I have been searching for a good Hakka / Asian food restaurant in Ajax for about 18 months. The only half decent place was Asian Delight, which has since closed down.   Asian Legend couldn't have opened soon enough. Rice and noodle portions are exceptional and there are so many meat options that it's impossible to try them all.   It's also good for the neighbourhood, especially with the many ethnicities that live in the area. I see people of all ages eating there.   Two thumbs up for sure !!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch.  Had the crispy ginger beef, it was quite good. Fast service. Clean restaurant and washrooms."}
{"text":"Hakka legend was amazing, the service was great our waitress checked in on us many times during our meal. The portion sizes were huge, and the price was really cheap I will visit frequently. You also get a discount on pick up if you use cash"}
{"text":"Ordered chilli chicken and the chicken was so BLACK from the inside and was unable to cut it either. Tasted so bad and not fresh. I let the server know and she told the manager/owner in front of me and he didnt even care to come to us and talk or something. Thats just bad business etiquettes. Wont go there ever."}
{"text":"Went there with my family a week after it opened, we had an order of beef with eggplant, an order of chicken fried rice, pakora chicken and a large order of chicken corn soup that we all shared. Food was okay, I really enjoyed the pakora chicken it was really good the issue was that we found a hair in both our chicken corn and beef with eggplant.. Disgusting. We felt bad telling them but we eventually did before leaving, the guy which seemed to be the owner apologized and offered us a free soup the next time we come. We agreed to not go there anymore until my girlfriend just tonight was craving fried rice so we went there and got take out. We ordered a fried rice and pakora chicken. Once again we found a hair in the fried rice.. Disappointing. We will definitely not go there again or recommend it to anyone.   Sad that they took out Wok With You which had the BEST chicken corn soup and amazing food overall to add this disappointing restaurant Hakka legends."}
{"text":"Crispy ginger beef is great. Spicy pepper chicken is really good. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Singaporean vermicelli rice noodle with chicken and the beef manchurian. I absolutely loved the noodles, it was light, flavourful and filling all at once.  The beef missed a little something for me, perhaps a bit of tang or some vegetables for a cruncy element. It missed the yum factor for me.   The prices were very reasonable and the servings were large. Would definitely order the noodles again!"}
{"text":"Hakka Legend is one of those places you go to when you and a group of people do not know what to eat.  We came here as a group of 6 extremely hungry people and the waiters were quick to serve us. We ordered 2 fried rices (chicken and veggie) chili and pakora chicken,  and their Hakka noodles. The taste was alright and we did leave pretty full + we were able to take home leftovers. Gets you out of that hunger and well the price ain't that bad."}
{"text":"I have been here two times already just to have their Manchow soup( chicken and shrimp) it's the best soup ever to have it especially during the winter time. The fish pakoras are also decent to eat and they give about 10 pieces, which is more than enough for about 4 people.  I was disappointed once when my fianc√© ordered a chicken and shrimp  soup for take out. He got home and ended up getting a vegetarian soup. Just be careful and double check before you leave."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a pleasant ambience and the food came to our table quickly.  The honey garlic chicken was average and I would like to try another chicken dish at a future visit.  The rice, noodles and stir fry dishes were enjoyable and balanced off the meal."}
{"text":"This place is very good for dinner . Staff is really nice and Quick service with good food quality. I been here on Friday night . Good food best value of your money."}
{"text":"This is nothing like the good quality you get from the main locations in markham Scarborough and tangerine locations. Food is bland and undercooked usually. No flavour in the food."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend and ordered the Legendary Chicken 88 (what a name, right?). It was delicious! It was served with a bowl of rice.  The chicken was cooked well - soft and cooked through on the inside with a crispy crust. The dish was pleasantly spicy (possibly a little too spicy for anyone who doesn't eat spicy food much).  I'll definitely be going back to try some of their other dishes, but I was impressed with my first go!  Update: I went back and had the Ginger Beef and General Tso chicken... both were garlicky and absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place after finding out that Frederick's is closed on lunar new year. I went here and got the chicken pakora. It was quite expensive for the portion you get. Taste wise it was pretty decent to good, I've never had chicken pakora at Frederick's but I hear theirs is better so I'm going to try that soon and update this review! They mentioned it was spicy but it was far from spicy and im not one to eat very spicy foods."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and fantastic customer service! I came in at 9:30 on (they close at 10) and the staff was very curtious and kind, made sure we did not feel rushed.  The food was delicious! I had the sweet and spicy beef with hekka noodles and nothing let me down. I will defiantly be back! (a little less close to their closing time) Thank you!"}
{"text":"My friend and I intended to go for the lunch specials but it was Christmas eve so we have to order regular. However, it was still was still great and customer service was good too, the atmosphere was calm and cozy. The food was really good, definitely recommend their vegetable noodles! Going to go back very soon. Highly recommended for group and couples."}
{"text":"It was one of those days when I worked late and had no desire to cook, so I decided to try Hakka Legend. I'm very glad I did. I got my order to go, and it was ready I'm about 10 minutes!  I especially like the vegetables in yellow curry, but the tiger prawns with eggplant was also excellent. I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Their Bombay chicken cannot be missed. If its going to be your first time there, try the Bombay chicken. If you've never tried the Bombay chicken, get the Bombay chicken.  The hot and sour chicken soup is good. The rice and noodle dishes I've tried weren't all that great. But overall it's worth coming back just for their hot and sour soup, and especially he Bombay chicken. I don't think anything else from the menu would be able to beat that one. That's how good it was."}
{"text":"I'm quite happy that Hakka Legend was referred to me.  I only go to Hakka Legend during lunch hours when I'm at work, so I'm not sure how this place is in the dinner time.  What keeps me coming back is the super cheap prices they have on the lunch specials. And it's anything you could wish for! Ranging from chow mein, to sweet and sour meats to fried rice. You get all that carby goodness!  I've really liked the honey garlic chicken so far. Though I do suggest asking for a little less sauce since they tend to over do it, and the sauce can get pretty sweet at times. I've also gotten the sweet and sour chicken, and the curry chicken.   Here's what I noticed about Hakka Legend. Anything you order, it will come deep fried. It was quite a surprise that the chicken pieces in the curry were battered and deep fried. It was a bit weird at first, and I wouldn't choose conventional curry over it, but it was interesting.  What I like is with any amount of sauce you can put on their deep fried meats, it never gets soggy. There's always that great flavourful crunch.   The number one reason I like about this place, is just how utterly fast the food comes. And having to drive roughly 7 minutes to get here, and 7 minutes back is great for me. Fast service, fast food.  It's always worth it to come here!"}
{"text":"I really like this place and we order from here at least once a month. The prices are very good and the quality of the food is A+. You also get a 10% discount if you pay with cash, another win.   We usually do takeout here, but the dining space looks nice as well. Great for families.   My top orders are:  - Manchurian Hakka noodles  - Bombay chicken (must try)  - chilli paneer  I like things spicy, but if you're not into spice I suggest asking them to make your order mild."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. We usually go to Fredericks restaurant either in Scarborough or Markham because the other Hakka restaurants we tried didn't live up to our expectations considering how often we enjoy this cuisine. We took a chance with this place today and it turned out to be a good decision. The flavours were on point and the best thing is that the dishes were not as greasy as the ones at Fredericks. We ordered the same dishes we normally ordered to compare: Dry Chilli Chicken $9.95, Stir Fried Green Bean $8.50, and House Special Hakka Noodle $9.75, plus 2 Steamed Rice $3.10 Our dinner for four came out to be $35.37 tax included and we still had to doggy bag the left over. Definitely come back to visit."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Manager/Owner tried to hustle and made us order way more food than we needed. Food was okay. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Gem of a resto in the middle of nowhere.  Tried 4 different dishes and all were tasty and excellent with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Hakka Legend on Markham Main St was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a loooong time - I'll post photos asap - I wish we had smellovision so you can smell these delicious dishes. it wasn't just the incredible tender food and amazing combo of spices - the staff customer service was ABOVE and beyond . Happy to have a Caucasian family there and not patronizing or pandering at all - but very happily shocked my 2 sons devoured such spicy food  !!!Definitely will rerun especially as my favorite Congee Wong just went under."}
{"text":"So many great choices at this resto, and it's open late for the after-movie crowd. Always crowded, so that tells you something.  Especially memorable are the dry crispy ginger beef, vegetable pakora, and fish pakora (ready yourself for the spice!).  Probably our favourite Hakka place so far . . ."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and never disappoints. Shrimp pakoras are awesome!"}
{"text":"One word: QUICK! great service and quick timing. I'm always there when it's super busy but I still get my food on time. Great spice levels. I'm a big fan of their Bombay Chicken and Hot N'Sour soup. Bombay chicken Is full of flavour and hot N'Sour soup just hits the spot.  Mmmmmmm mmmmm good! They have great lunch deals!! Name change did not affect food service or prices. STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO ALL!!"}
{"text":"Really really liked the Bombay Beef! It's like crispy beef with a spicy kick. Delicious and sooo addicting.  Also tried the Sizzling Phoenix Fish. The name got me. Gotta order something with Phoenix in it. It was very good. The fish was still crispy with a subtly spicy sauce."}
{"text":"While the food here is flavourful, the chicken is crispy and the deep fried tofu is great. I have a hard time accepting extra hidden charges. When I order a dish and the waitress asks the spicy level - to which we replied 'spicy' --- the bill had charged us extra 0.50 cents for manchurian spice. What the heck is up with that?!? It's ridiculous! I've eaten many times at restaurants serving spicy food (Hakka, Indian, Mexican, Thai .. Whatever)  Bottom line: No need to charge when i ask for it spicy.  Service is blah- had to ask multiple times for water. I used to love this place, I've been here many times ... Like at least 6-7 times in the past for dine in and at least 10-15 times for takeout... and it's not what it used to be. The service is crap. That's why they get 2 stars.    Treat your customers with some more respect and incentive to return. The food is good I'll give them that. But service needs to step it up- big time. The manager/owner need to stop being so stingy/cheap.  The food is good- but I cannot get over the lack of service and puhLEASE charging extras for spicy is a rip off.  So really, it's not a problem with the chefs or the menu, my issue is with the service and the people punching in the numbers.  If you really want Hakka food with better service---- Go to Tangerine across the street in the other plaza or even Fredriks in the plaza beside or maybe even Hakka King.  Anywhere where they add a charge for SPICE is a rip off. I don't care if its only $0.50.. that's beyond ridiculous. Last time I checked the we didn't live in the middle of nowhere where ingredients that lend 'spice' cost so much. The customer population is largely south Asian. You cannot charge for spice."}
{"text":"Really good for lunch.  You can call ahead and order. I usually get the chili chicken but the Manchurian chicken is also very tasty. Great deal comes with either a spring roll or soupI think I'll try the chicken pakoras at some point for sure. Ive also been here for dinner once and had the beef hofun which was also very tasty."}
{"text":"This was not my go-to place, but had to settle since Frederick (just across the next block) was closed for take-out that night. I ordered the chilli chicken, garlic eggplants and the pankora chicken.  The order itself was extremely fast (10 mins to get prepared) but when I went into the restaurant it surprised me a little that it was empty about 30min before closing on a friday night. It was my first time here so... benefit of the doubt - total $30.  While driving past Frederick, which was closing in about 30min as well, I saw many people inside still eating (sadly takeout/last call closed)...  hmmmm...  I brought the food home, and after tasting it, I could honestly say that it was food court quality at best. Kinda of a rip-off for $30... Please see attached picture of the food taken.  The eggplant and chili chicken was rather bland, meat quality was okay though.  Update: the next day I got a stomache ache.  I do not think I will be coming back here... Frederick is the go-to for hakka-chinese food. Could be a reason why this store was so empty when I went in..."}
{"text":"Had the $6.95 lunch special and chose the Bombay chicken with spring roll. The chicken was very tasty, spiced nicely and not too much batter. Spring roll was crispy and good too. Satisfied with the portion and found it good value. Will probably give Kings Wok down the street some take out competition as well. They will have to manage their pricing and food quality in order to compete but should be able to survive."}
{"text":"Checked out Hakka Legend for the first time, and I would call it a solid lunch joint.  The chicken pakora were good, but not as good as Federick of course, but yummy, and the lunch special sweet and sour shrimp were okay, and filling. Nothing exceptional to write home about, but solid food for the money."}
{"text":"Ordered a takeout yesterday and totally disappointed. Stop selling cheap quality expensive food to customers. I was excited when this place opened up walking distance from home, but I'd rather drive down to Fine Taste on bayly and get my money's worth. You guys should call yourself \"Dhoka Legend\"!"}
{"text":"Visited today with family. Chicken Pakoras and Spicy tiger prawns were good but overall the food lacked some salt. I would visit again to try other stuff on the menu but yet to find a place in the GTA that is as good, consistent and value for money as Federicks!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner. Food wad amazing and staff were friendly and attentive!!! Will return when in the neighbourhood again."}
{"text":"We wanted to go to Frederick but ended up going here as Frederick was busy. Glad we came here. Nice ambience and good food. Lots of menu choices from Indian to Thai to Hakka Chinese. We bought the manchurian seafood fried rice, Thai seafood fried rice and red chicken curry. They all had distinct flavours with adequate spice level. Staffs were good. Surely come back again."}
{"text":"I came in with my buddy colleague on a Wed afternoon, after work and their special lunch hours. We could have arrived earlier to enjoy the lunch special from 1 to 3pm. Alright, my bad ...I could have saved some coins. Anyways, here we are. Service is good first... why first.... yes here is the story.  It could have deserved four stars.....sorry your server made our payment process stressful.   The server who took our order , she was fine and able to answer our inquiries and suggested the appropriate size for two of us.     Food & price value: 5/5 Service was good at the beginning and eating process. The server kept pouring water for us and got us napkins, everything seemed fine.   We shared food so we were given two bowls but one has food remains or dirty stains on it so we asked to exchange one... one score lost due to the improper cleaning ..... having said that .. not a big deal . We were still enjoying the taste of the food at a good value.  We spent almost two hours chatting while we were the only table in the restaurant.  Okay,  all of a sudden,  the server (~ different one not the one who took the order) gave us a bill and asking us to pay debit or cash ...during our conversation... that means basically our dinner was interrupted inappropriately without asking, and getting us to pay the bill first..... I then asked ok, are you closing up your cash ? She said no but still standing there and waiting to take our payment. .. then we didn't wanna stay anymore and we paid cash and left unpleasantly.... the server could have handled this better.    And we haven't ask for the bill yet....... it is understandable to empty the table at the restaurant if we were occupying your table while your restaurant is full or other customers were waiting badly.    I would definitely look forward the improvement on the payment process.  It was not a good impression at the end of our dining experience at this location of Hakka legend in Markham store.   Tip: take out 10% off if order is over $20. It could be a better and enjoyable meal for me if I didn't need to get to pushed to pay. ........ unpleasantly leaving and we both were full with good hakka noodle and Thai veggie soup. Great value food and adequate service but was not a good end for us here.:("}
{"text":"Customer service was great , but the food was bad maybe it is just me ( I personally don't like Chinese ) everything too spicy too much gravy and in general too heavy .. They have good portions though . If you like Chinese food maybe it is good for you .. Price was in good range"}
{"text":"This restaurant is just close by to my college makes it my go to place to have lunch or dinner at times. I love going here theh have a lot of availabilities and choices as well. My go to place and its worth it."}
{"text":"The Bollywood Sizzling Paneer at this location wasn't as juicy as the one at the Mississauga location. This seemed to be a bit more dry. Regardless it was hella delicious. Love that they've made such a tasty vegetarian dish."}
{"text":"Tried the chili chicken and the Manchurian beef, both tasted great. Went during lunch on a Sunday and the food and service was great. Will come back to try the rest of their items in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and this is hands one of my favourite hakka places to dine in at in Markham.   The guy who owns it a sweet old man and he's just so caring and friendly. The staff here are also very patient and attentive even when they get an order wrong they will apologize and sort it out with you respectfully. The prices have increased over time along with everything else nowadays. It's on par with other hakka prices in Markham give or take. But I like how the portions are big enough to share. My boyfriend and I usually get a carb dish, with a meat and pakoras.($34 after tax) That is enough for both of us and we always have some to take home as well.   Our favourite to get there is the chicken pakora for sure. They are really spicy but it's such a good spice and the size of each pakora is nice and big. I've been to other places that have tiny pakoras like no thank you.   The service can be really quick and other times it takes a little bit. But they will bring out the appetizers first really quickly so you at least have something to munch on. The last time I was there the mains took a little longer than usual but then again I saw the staff dealing with an obnoxious lady next to us. Who took up all their time attention but throughout the whole time the staff were really pleasant and patient with her considering how annoying she was.   This place is a must try. It's super casual but you will leave full."}
{"text":"I took my friend from Bangalore here once because she wanted to experience *good* Hakka food and now she misses it from across the world. I've been getting takeout from here for a while and their food has never disappointed. It's always a little busy if you're going to sit down, and the waiting time to get a table is pretty long but that just tells you how good it is."}
{"text":"We found this place just by yelping the neighborhood. Therefore, thanks to Yelp we got to try this place as we were in the area. Upon arriving, the place looked kind of run down but it was a full house. Got here around 9:10pm and still people were eating and ordering. Since I didn't know what to order, I just went according to suggestions that other Yelpers had suggested. Which was the following...   - Pakora fried chicken (YUMMY! But takes 15min) - Mango salad (asked for mild) - Hakka house special fried noodles  - Ginger Ale  When everything arrived, it all tasted delicious. Except they forgot our Ginger Ale drink.    Too bad we didn't order more but there was only 2 of us so we really couldn't order much otherwise it would have been too much to finish.   Overall I would come back and try it again to see what else is on the menu."}
{"text":"Pretty great. Best spring rolls. Fresh and good value. I will hit this place on a regular basis for lunch."}
{"text":"Tasty hakka food that can sometimes be hit or miss depending on the dish, but they have a huge menu with lots of variety and varying levels of heat. I've used them several times to cater parties and they've always come through with a couple days notice and a decent discount if you pay cash."}
{"text":"Amazing hakka grub! I've had the bombay chicken, house special hakka noodle, all simply amazing. Flavourful,  fresh, generous portions. Some leftovers for lunch the next day.  Very friendly and courteous staff, large dining room. Place is always busy with diners."}
{"text":"Hakka Legend deserves 5 stars after sampling their great Chinese food. Chilli chicken dry was outstanding! Singapore noodles are ever so yummy. I'm coming back for more very soon!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff, with very good food.  Spicy ginger beef is fab!  Chilli chicken could use a bit more spice.  Very clean and a good place to have a meal and conversation.  Noodles are hot and delicious!  Serving size is very generous."}
{"text":"Great staff, quick, clean and so yummy every time. Always get hot and sour soup and general Tao. They make it as spicy or mild as u like. Always busy, food fresh."}
{"text":"Summary: Hakka restaurant holds its own in saucy classics such as Manchurian and Chili chicken, but REALLY stands out with it's dry chicken seasoning, although you'll have to forgive the service and average portion size  Top Must-Get: Bombay chicken  Top Regret: Spring rolls  My friend and I have come here for lunch a few times as it's right in the area. It's in a quiet plaza just south of Frederick's, which is a more well-known Hakka restaurant - making comparisons between the two natural. Frederick's offers literally more (both in menu options and quantity), but Hakka Legend, in my experience, has a slight edge in flavour and taste in some of its dishes.  FOOD Manchurian chicken: this is my go-to Hakka dish. At Hakka Legend, it was good but not incredible. The colour of the sauce was less vivid than others (and that's a good thing - I find I am a bit more cautious eating bright red foods than dull coloured sauces). 3.5/5  Bombay chicken: amazing flavour in this dry rub dish, although it leans to the slightly salty end. This has plenty of kick, and the more you eat it, the more the heat will kick in. 4.5/5  Lunch specials come with your choice of soup or spring roll. Neither were particularly amazing, but the spring roll tasted oily and soggy the first time I had it. The second time around, it was slightly better, but I definitely wouldn't come here for those.  SERVICE You get your seats and your order in pretty quickly, and your food comes not too long after that, but that's where it seems to end. It's not too busy, so the slow service is really puzzling.   We had our water refilled once (and only after a few minutes of trying to flag someone down), and this has happened almost every time I've been here. To be fair, the owner seems to care when he's not in the kitchen, but the serving staff are definitely not appearing interested in customer service.  My thought is that restaurants that want to get away with shoddy service or check-ins should really provide whole pitchers of water/drinks. How can you serve spicy foods and not expect people to get thirsty?  The service pulls it down to a 3/5. However, the Bombay chicken (and close proximity) keeps me coming back from time to time."}
{"text":"Was expecting great hakka food based on the reviews of their other locations but was greatly disappointed. Ordered the chili chicken, beef hakka noodles and their appetizer platter. The appetizer consisted of chicken and shrimp pakoras, deep fried potatoes cake plus fried wontons. Nothing special but not bad either. The beef hakka noodles were bland and very very greasy. The chili chicken was spicy but no other flavour and also very very greasy. Service is decent, restaurant is modern and clean. Pick up or dine in only, so no delivery."}
{"text":"Chicken pakora is a must! It was so good i ordered the Bombay Chicken which continued to be just as flavourful! If you want a dry chicken dish then go for the Bombay Chicken especially as a lunch special!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Asian cuisines I've ever had. You don't expect such fair price given and judging by the superb quality of the food. This is a must try - I will be here regularly as part of my weekly food regime."}
{"text":"Came here because my friend and I was having cravings for hakka food. First time coming here. Surprisingly it wasn't too busy when we arrived for dinner at around 7pm. It got busier as the night progressed. It's a nice small restaurant in Markham. We ordered the Chicken Pakora, Vegetable Paneer and the Noodles dish. Portion size is good. For some of the dishes, I wish they gave more as some hakka places I've been to, they definitely give more food. Flavour wise, the dishes overall were delicious and seasoned well. We asked for mild spice and it was not too overwhelming to handle eating. The paneer is definitely there most delicious out of the veggie dishes and also the most expensive. The pakora was very succulent, crispy, hot and nicely battered in the fryer. Overall, the staff including the owner were really friendly and service was great. They refilled out pitcher of water every time we finished. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you were looking for good hakka food."}
{"text":"Comfortable, hospitable environment and excellent Hakka food. The staff is amiable, the restaurant is very clean and the ambience is great. I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. In my previous visit I recall having the spicy okra dry which was very nice. Today I came for lunch, the restaurant itself is modern and clean. The servers are friendly And attentive. I ordered the Chilli Chicken lunch special wth soup and the Chilli Chicken Wings. I received the Manchurian soup which was loaded with coriander and very tasty; beware if you are not a fan. The Chilli Chicken with steamed rice was really good and the star. Large crispy pieces of chicken that held up under the thick and flavourful sauce. Also lots of white onions that were not not overlooked! The Chilli Chicken Wings were underwhelming. Too greasy and only came with without the drummer yes, which I presume they use for their lollipop chicken dish. They tasted like they were just deep fried without any seasoning and covered in sambal sauce."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant for quite a few times now. I am a huge fan of Indo-Chinese food and i tell you this place is a gem for someone looking to satisfy their taste palate with spicy indo-chinese cuisine. The person who runs this place is always smiling and a happy go lucky guy. Everything we have tried here so far has met our expectations of Indo-Chinese food in GTA. I highly recommend this restaurant for vegetarians especially bcz the staff said that vegan/vegetarian food is cooked separately from non vegetarian food which is good. The spice level can be adjusted as per your taste bud. So there is something for all. The quantity for some of the dishes are really good, can sometimes serve 2 people, service is super quick and reasonably priced which is the best part."}
{"text":"My favourite hakka place. I used to come here every weekend with my family before we moved. I came here over the weekend and got my two favorite things: the schezewan fried rice and the chilli paneer. Still tastes amazing. However, they used to offer free rice with the chilli paneer but I guess they don't anymore. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been here."}
{"text":"I ordered some sweet and sour chicken from this place and to be honest I thought the chicken was kind of tasteless to me. I couldn't finish the food because of it! I thought the staff was nice but I won't come back unless they learn how to season their food properly!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after reading a Yelp review. At 8:00 on a Sunday night the restaurant was humming with customers - reassuringly. Takeout was popular but our tableservice was quick and polite. Highly recommended are the pakora appetizers. We had mango chicken and a spicy prawn dish. Fabulous! The ingredients were fresh and tasty. Wine and beer are available on the menu. A very good dining experience."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for hakka food. I've gone quite a few times with friends and family and have tried a variety of dishes that have all been amazing, including chili chicken dry, Bombay chicken, manchurain hakka noodkes, legend poutine, and chicken pakora, to name a few.  If spice is what your looking for then this is a great option. Fast service, great food every time and extremely affordable."}
{"text":"The pakoras are the most delicious items on the menu, but their lunch specials are so worth it! It's just over $7 for a perfectly portioned serving of some of their best dishes! We usually have some left over to take home for dinner. I would also recommend their mango chicken, it's sweet and spicy, and has a nice crispy texture on the chicken or shrimp. Their red Thai veggie curry is my personal favourite! Rich flavourful spices in a thick coconut Garvey, what could be better?"}
{"text":"Legit Indo-Chinese food. But the waiters need to be more polite. Shrimp Pakora was good, but Bombay Chicken and Chicken Manchurian Noodle were bit oily."}
{"text":"For those unfamiliar, the name \"Hakka\" actually refers to an ethnic group within China spread all around the world but in Toronto, the term has been used almost exclusively (and somewhat erroneously) in reference to Chinese people who settled in India.\" - blogTO  Had to put that in lest other newbies like myself commit any faux pas and offend any Hakka people out there. Now on to my review....  Clean roomy restaurant. Not the warmest of receptions but that's reflected in the price. You can't have cheap food and stellar customer service too, that's rare indeed. Came for the lunch special and was happy to find out that you can order it to go, not all places allow that.  Had the General Tso chicken (which came with Manchurian soup) and Manchurian beef (which came with an eggroll) lunch specials. The General Tso was tasty and sweet, the Manchurian beef was tenderized like they do in Chinese restaurants so I wasn't too wild about the mouthfeel of it, but it was flavorful with tons of garlic and ginger. Both came with generous amounts of rice. They added way too much thickener to the Manchurian soup. The eggroll was crispy and tasty but was oily and they skimped on the fillings.   Would definitely come back for their affordable lunch specials. Higher rating pending I find more dishes that I like."}
{"text":"Pay attention to details: reasonably priced lunch specials with generous portions that are tasty but can be oily. Drawbacks: place needs a good cleaning and freshening up of decor (lip of pitcher dirty, dusty lights, chipped dessert menu holder, table tops worn down in places - check out picture details), service just delivers food and 10% service charge is automatically tacked on check (there was only two of us).  ORDERED: Bombay Chicken with egg roll subbing out rice for Hakka noodles $1.75 - chicken tasted like they used tandoori chicken to make the dish: large portion, flavorful tender chicken but the noodles just tasted like oily chow mein noodles. The egg roll was crispy on the outside and soggy on the inside.  Chili Fish lunch special with Hot and  Sour soup subbing out plain white rice for fried rice $1.25 - They battered, fried the fish then cooked it with the onions and spices: again tasty but the coating on the fish was soggy. They put too much thickener in the soup.  Rating 2.5 bumped up to 3 because I would come back if I was in the area and I was in the mood for tasty but greasy fast food quality Hakka food."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday for lunch with two other coworkers, and we were seated right away. We noticed people of all ethnicities which indicated that this place had real \"spice\" and was close to authentic. We ordered 3 different dishes which was more than enough for all of us, and allowed us to try different things. The portions are large and the food didn't disappoint. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My family orders from here regularly.  Quantity: very good. Most ppl will be full.  Service: take out, extremely friendly! Quality: 4.5/5, very good food Ordered:  Today: food was exceptional today!! Chicken Pad Thai: amazingggg. Really enjoy it and one of my favorites here! Chicken88: excellent! I def suggest Singapore fried rice: very good Honey garlic wings- ok, extreme sauce- but sweetness was welcomed with spicy.   Previous:  Chicken pad thai: excellent  Chili chicken: ok Both dishes were fairly spicy but very tasty. Thoroughly enjoyed the pad thai and will be back for it regularly."}
{"text":"My friends and I go to hakka legend at least once a month since it's one of the more affordable options in the area. They offer a lunch special where you can get one meat item, fried rice or noodles, and spring roll or a drink for about $10. My go-to meat items are either the szechuan chicken or the manchurian chicken.   The portions here are very generous so you will never leave hungry. Most of the time the food is good but there have been a few instances when the meat has tasted a bit off... like leftovers from the night before. Also I've noticed that they change the recipe for their chicken dishes pretty often because each time we order it's a different colour.  I'm not the biggest fan of hakka food in general, but this place will definitely fill you up"}
{"text":"Surprised to see my friend \"Lawrence\" from Tangerine working there. The food is as good as Tangerine but hot and sour soup, chicken pakuro, chilli checiken better. Super friendly place, good service and well priced."}
{"text":"We had an unexpectedly great experience. We ordered a lot of food. Service was very attentive. Standouts included chicken pakoras, Shanghai noodles, ginger beef and Hakka chicken 88. All reasonably priced, it came out to about $20/pp including tax and tip and we had lots of leftovers. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great Hakka Food! With great veggie options if you are someone like me who dines in with friends and family who are vegetarian.  Some of their best dishes -Bombay Chicken (dry spicy chicken) -Manchurian Chicken (Red spicy sauce) -Chili Chicken ------veggie------- -Bombay Paneer -Chilli Paneer -Manchurian Balls (veggie balls in manchuria sauce)  SOOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Good service and good food. There's free parking on the side of the restaurant. The food came reasonably fast and well presented. The sizzling plate was very nice and if you add a bit of water it will give you an extra juice to it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Hakka food, this place will  definitely meet your needs. The place is crowded - both for home delivery and dine in. They have a lunch special but I went with my family for dinner. The Chicken Corn soup is great - the server himself  recommended the portion. Other stuff to try out are the Chicken Lollipop, Shrimp Pakora. I am a fan of their Chicken Shrimp fried rice and Chicken Manchuria - this is what makes Hakka so good. There is ample parking space and the servers are nice although it's quite busy out there. They have two TVs there so you can catch up on games when having dinner. Overall, it's a good place if you are looking for solid Hakka food - highlt."}
{"text":"I would like start of by saying I love Hakka food, and this place definitely does it right!  We had the chilli fish and the vegetarian balls with szcheuan fried rice, and everything was very quick and delicious. Their servings are also big, so we even had some for leftovers.  The place was completely packed on a Sunday evening and the staff were constantly busy and keeping up with the crowd."}
{"text":"Highlights: black pepper beef, fast service.   Food: 4/5, quality are generally good and tasty, comes with good portion too. I've came here three times so far, and enjoyed my visits every time.  Service: 4/5, food comes fast, servers are nice. Do expect waiting for a table for rush hours."}
{"text":"The food very average. Beef fried rice was good. We ordered chilli chicken and asked for extra spicy but it was barely mild. The sizzling mutton was way too oily. I find the portion was a bit too small for the price"}
{"text":"We are a group of Chinese and Indian. We stopped by for lunch. The staff recommended us Legendary Paneer 88 and Veggie Ball. They were delicious! It cames with Hekka Legend's unique Manchurian sauce. This experience is unforgettable."}
{"text":"The best location! Ordered chicken fried rice, black pepper beef and bombay chicken. Wow the bombay chicken is just incredible! So tasty and portions are huge so order wisely. Will return"}
{"text":"Second visit was just as good as the first and we got to try different dishes. Everything was good but my favourite from this evening was the Crispy Ginger Beef. It really was crispy, with just a little bit of sweetness.  Service was, once again, friendly and very efficient."}
{"text":"Awesome Hakka! Many other flavours as well including Thai and Chinese. Great selection including pakoras. Very tasty and fast friendly service. Great place."}
{"text":"Manchurian soup and chilli chicken is always amazing. Hakka noodles and rice is a perfect add-on. Good service. What else do you need. Always a family and friend favourite."}
{"text":"I really like their hot and sour soup too! Lunch specials are great value for money and yes their service is quick. This is one of those reliable fail-proof places that you've got to try. And once you do, you can mentally bookmark it for a quick, cheap, but fulfilling meal."}
{"text":"1st and last time I will go to this place.  I heard great food from my coworker and I decided to try the food.  I ordered chilli chicken and to my surprise I found hair in my food.  I am so disgusted."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 dishes from the lunch special. The Cantonese Chowmein was terrible! The chilly chicken, chilly fish and chilly beef were ok. Chicken pakora and Cantonese chowmein were coloured red with food colour!"}
{"text":"There is no shortage or hakka restaurants in this area. this place while serves better food than most, is still not up to par to other hakka restaurants i have tried. The spring rolls are terrible store bought, the dark chicken is of bad quality so i pay extra to get white chicken. I really hate the decor and design of the restaurant. Its extremely tight and feel claustrophobic. Cleanliness is also a issue. I wouldnt rush to come back here."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food. Fast easy friendly service. I always pick and get %10 discount when I pay cash."}
{"text":"Came here to try the Asian food and it's like your ordinary Chinese fast food with a lot of sauce. Worth it during lunch since they had a lunch special during the week from 11-3. It was only about $6 and included a spring roll and rice. Id come here again for the lunch special"}
{"text":"This location just opened in Ajax. I was pleasantly surprised. Large menu of many options. We ordered the mango chicken, the vegetarian hakka noodles and chciken pad Thai. All the dishes were tasty and not overly greasy, which Hakka is notorious for! The prices are fair, portions aren't massive but reasonable for the prices and filling. Very clean and nicely laid out and decorated restaurant. It was so nice in fact I changed my take out order to a dine in. My kids enjoyed the food and they are very picky. I'm a fan now. Only criticism would be to stick to the Chinese and Hakka dishes."}
{"text":"Their vegetarian manchurian was delicious. Decent ambience. Lot of options and really good food."}
{"text":"Great Food, lots of choice. I've been here about a dozen times, and the food is always well prepared and delicious. Haven't found a bad option on the menu yet."}
{"text":"My favourite Hakka place at a walkable distance! Their Bombay chicken and Chilli Chicken are delicious.. I liked the Fried rice more than any noodles so far.. I am quite a regular here"}
{"text":"The chicken dishes were average but the Hakka Noodles are the best I've ever had. The Bombay Paneer is also a must try."}
{"text":"Great food, not so great service   They're usually in a rush to get you in and out the door to serve more people  They've mixed up my order several times - especially with sizes or omitting ingredients (ordered a medium soup, they gave me a small) - didn't even replace it once I told them because there weren't enough waiters to address this. Also have found on occasions that they serve pre made food that's been reheated as my manchurian gravy was slimy almost as if it's been thawed out after sitting in the fridge.   Other than that their vegetarian dishes are delicious! Would recommend the Hakka Noodles and Fried Rice."}
{"text":"Nice cheap food for the price! Clean washroom with Dyson airblade. All card payments require $10+. Mango chicken so good. Going to get Bombay chicken next time.   Lunch specials 11 to 3. Prices are $5.95 and $6.95"}
{"text":"********W A R N IN G ********CLIENTELE SHOULD TAKE  CAUTION WHEN ORDERING FROM THIS RESTAURANT HAKKA LEGEND  If YOU WANT ABUSE ,ORDER ON YOUR ACCORD. On Monday February 26th 2018 I placed an order for pick up. When picking up the server DOMENIC confirmed my telephone number in relation to my order  and gave me order after paying. When I got home which  is completely  on the other side of the city , I realized I received the wrong order,I telephoned and explained my dilemma that I received the wrong oder despite him (Domenic ) giving me the wrong order. Already he was defensive and mentioned that I received an order that was $40.00 even though its wrong , ahhhh....  what wrong with this scenario ? He was rude and obviously not customer oriented, as he felt I should drive from the other side of town and return the order , I merely wanted some form of credit  for next time as I did not want the this order as  there were some ingredients that I may be allergic to, hence I was specific with my  order I made. He flew into to me with rage , in exclamation that I was rude, with more of his expletives ,I calmly explained that I shouldn't pay for an order that was totally wrong, again I couldn't finish my sentences, with repetive rage he constantly interrupted,I did't feel I was at fault obviously after all ,he checked my number with a cavalier attitude . He finalized the call by hanging up. Domenic is a representative of his HAKKA LEGEND restaurant . and I was surprised with his customer server etiquette, especially when his customers are his business. The nature of how he conducted himself is more conducive to  a server at some raunchy low class quality zero star  bar restaurant  and should he should not be in this  type of business . His mannerism of service is is more appropriate to customers who like abuse and eating restaurant orders that they paid for and and did't initially order. If you want problems this, restaurant is in your prescription.  He is ruining the name of HAKKA LEGEND even if he feels he is  in so much comfort and standing but reputations disappear as do restaurants , and he doesn't realize that, many restaurants have gone out of business because they are sitting pretty and ignoring that customer service is paramount this day and age. I advise customers to stay clear of the Hakka Legend  restaurants as their attitude is is far from exemplary in comparison   to other Hakka restaurants in Scarborough.  Attitudes reflect their cooking style as \"Don't Care Manner\"  maybe the way your food is prepared. Eat at your own risk. HAKKA LEGEND IS NOT A LEGEND ITS THE OPPOSITE."}
{"text":"The food was really good! We got the shrimp pakoras, shrimp fried wontons, manchurian beef, bombay chicken, chilli chicken and seafood singapore vermicelli noodles. Everything was very tasty and for the price, the portions are amazing. Only con was the pakoras were a bit on the salty side."}
{"text":"Awsome Hakka food Even more shockingly this place has great service  Unlike other Asian places esp the neighbouring fredricks the staff provided great customer service the food was terrific  Wish they had more dessert options Chicken 88 wings and sizzling food all awsome  People cant go wrong with this halal hakka!!"}
{"text":"Hakka noodles and hakka vegi Manchurian.. Awesome.. Only problem is they charge extra for dine in"}
{"text":"When you have that craving for spicy goodness, this is the place to be.   Unlike the other nearby hakka chinese restaurants this place is clean and spacious with great customer service, this is consistent with both scarborough and mississauga locations.   I love their chilli chicken and their hot and sour soup.  I agree with everyone else on their lunch specials,  great bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Finally a good Hakka place in the area! Our server was exceptionally friendly and checked in on us multiple times- something you don't often experience in this type of restaurant. The owner even came by our table and gave us a little chat about Hakka origins. We ordered chilli chicken (with sauce) it wasn't as spicy as most I have tried which I liked because you could actually taste the flavours in the dish. The Hakka noodles are a must and the crispy ginger beef was delicious.  A great cheap and quick meal."}
{"text":"Was here on Good Friday. Tried the singapore fried rice and the spicy shrimp. They were so good! I will definitely come back to this location. I love that if you ask for very spicy, they make it very spicy."}
{"text":"So this is probably my favourite place right now. Friendly service with an intimate setting. Prices are really good too, especially for the amount of food you get. I paid $37 for chicken balls, fried chicken, chilli chicken, mango salad, and white rice. It's the best Chinese food around, not greasy like other places. They also have a promo if you order via phone/online for pick up and pay with cash you get 10% off. I'd recommend their mango salad it's so delicious. Definitely will be going there again hopefully in the near future."}
{"text":"Bombay chicken is the best ....big portions and cheaper .."}
{"text":"Yep! The same restaurant as before. I always buy the chicken balls. Big pieces of chicken in it. I recommend this place"}
{"text":"We got takeout , beef fried rice peppered steak and noodles with beef. All the beef in each dish tasted . The quality of the meat was not good . Will not be getting takeout from this place ever again."}
{"text":"I orden the chilly chicken they put a lot of ginger, I love spacy dragon and Frederick hakka I never change agian"}
{"text":"Been here many times good lunch specials would recommend to others. Ask for little gravy if not you'll need a spoon."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a long time ordered one of my favorite dishes with any luck will be back soon. Great food for the price. Would recommend this place to anybody whos  in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Chicken Pakora one of my favourite among all Hakka restaurant around Markham juicy, crispy and fresh.   Mango salad very refreshing after eating something spicy.   Very good service, constantly refill our water and ask how our food was.  Will be coming back, I think the dishes are made better than Fredrick, and Tangerine."}
{"text":"this place is my new favourite place for Hakka food, I had the Bombay chicken on steamed white rice and a hot and sour soup, the soup (which came first) was delicious but not as spicy as I had hoped... some hot sauce that was on the table fixed that though. the Bombay chicken was so good! the spices were perfectly mixed and all the flavours came together perfectly. the rice was also good and went very well with the chicken. I also tried the chilly chicken that someone else in our party had, this was also very good, the sauce was also very well prepared and went well with rice. over all, I definitely recommend going here for a quick and cheap meal."}
{"text":"Once you get over the bleach odor, this is a nice little neighbourhood restaurant.   Good portion sizes, not expensive, and service was fast n friendly.   Went with a group from work and all were satisfied with:  Chilli Chicken - Dry, Green Curry (Thai) and the seafood noodle dish.   We even had leftovers.   Tiny parking lot, but it's a good lunch spot."}
{"text":"A friend was in town and he didn't have Hakka cuisine in his city so we decided to treat ourselves. As it was Christmas day, this was one of the few places open. We were served immediately and the server was knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the appetizer platter with chicken pakora, spring rolls and wanton. As it's only $2 more expensive most appetizers with some variety, I definitely recommend it.  The Szechuan noodles with chicken, beef and shrimp had the perfect ratio of meat, vegetables to noodles with the right amount of kick. The Bombay Chicken was good enough but arrived cold which is why u took off a star. The portions were large enough that we both had enough to take home for a quick lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I love Hakka food, I tried many Hakka places in town so I know what the flavours should be like. The dish that sets the bar for me is the Manchurian chicken, if the place knows how to make that dish right, they most likely have good chef-at this location that's definitely the case.  Besides one other place downtown, this is the best Manchurian chicken I've ever had, I also tried their \"house special noodles\" which was also great.   Service was really good, the only thing I did like was the fact they are charging $2 for tea where other places give it for free. I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend that had a good experience previously.  This time he agrees with me on all the dishes. This is the second time I've been here and it tasted better.  Chili chicken - choose the dry version rather than the wet imo. Excellent. Manchurian Noodles - this dish is never good at the \"other\" hakka place. However, here to my surprise, as my friend ordered it... excellent. Shrimp Pekora - the highlight of my expectations, the batter was great but the shrimp inside was rather overcooked and we couldn't identify the other filling, perhaps potato seemed to make the dish mediocre. Perhaps we will try the chicken next time. Chicken fried rice - this dish was standard, the execution was mediocre, I would not order it again.  Summary: It's a good change from the other hakka place we frequent - a couple exceptional dishes."}
{"text":"This placebos just awesome. The part owner (brother is just amazing to deal with he answered all my stupid question and the boot the food was great.   So far I've had the honey garlic chicken (which is sooooo go it's like candy), the Hakka noodles, mango noodles and spicy ginger chicken - all are amazing and the portions are great."}
{"text":"Originally known as Tangerine, this place changed its name but thankfully not their menu. It's a great sit-down place for the family. You're going to find some chili peppers littered next to the names of the dishes on the menu, but stay cool. If you're like me and aren't very tolerant of spice you can tell them to tone it down. Their service is good, but not excellent. Expect a bit of a wait on the weekends for seating and for the food to come out.  The food is delicious and affordable which you just can't beat! Hands down my favourite is the Hot and sour soup in any variation - veggie, chicken or seafood! I also enjoy the Bombay chicken, Lollipop chicken, and Beef with snow peas & mushroom."}
{"text":"Big portions for the price. love the schezuan chicken, shrimp pakora. Will definitely come back here to try the other menu items"}
{"text":"This is an alright Hakka food place on Warden. The inside is nice but they could spice up the food a little more. I come to Hakka places to eat the spicy chicken and this looked good but could improve a bit on the flavor. Overall it is ok."}
{"text":"Went here to try a different Hakka place. Had Chicken 88, Chilli Chicken, Bombay Shrimp, and green beans.   All of the dishes had a hint of sugar. I don't like this with my Hakka cuisine, so it was a big turn off.   The heat level was moderate.   On the positive side, each dish came with a small serving. Of rice. Other places charge extra."}
{"text":"Just near Fredericks. I was skeptical but no regrets.  The chicken 88 was deep fried and stir fried in a sauce. The say it is Malay influence and excellent. This is one of the house specialty   The General Tao Fish was yummy.  Not too sweet and no annoying red sauce. Some great flavors here.   The Manchurian Tofu and veg  bit boring. Soya base in a deep brown  soup.  Not exactly what I expected.   I am planning  on coming back to explore the other dishes."}
{"text":"Worst place to go  for dine in. Terrible service. They made us wait longtime order.. food here is overrated too"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend and it was great. Friend is doing well. Took a different item for takeout (chilli chicken) and ate with sister. We both ended up with food poisoning."}
{"text":"Just order from Hakka legend at Scarborough location and thought I would get the garlic chicken (white meat).  Came home and noticed it was all batter.  Be care eating battered food from here. They rob you by battering the food and adding little to no chicken.  Word of advice cut into the food and see if there is meat."}
{"text":"Love this location! The staff are super friendly and helpful. They give you good suggestions as well. It's better to go during lunch time, they have amazing deals and the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"If you've been to the Warden and Eglinton location & the Markham location, then you know those locations are much better. Don't get me wrong, I love eating at Hakka Legend, however this location was not the best.   Service was fast, however it seemed like the waiters tried to rush you and move on. I understand the place can get a bit busy during lunch time, however you want to provide the best service you can. Maybe even a smile or being a bit more nice would help.  The food was really good, except for the soup and spring rolls. Probably the best part of our visit. Something I did notice was that this location gives you a much smaller portion than the other two locations I've been to. I know it's a lunch deal and it's cheaper, but the other two locations give a decent portion. Whatever you do, do not get the Manchurian soup or spring rolls. Both of them were not good. I'd recommend the vegetable fried rice, bombay chicken and crispy chicken.  P.S. the steam rice is not complimentary with entrees anymore. Also, if your order is less than $10, you have to pay with cash. If I want to eat at Hakka Legend, I'd probably go to the other locations."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, and the food was delicious! We got the hot + sour soup, house special fried rice, chilli beef, and we got a chicken dish (forgot what it was called but know it's under the sizzling dishes). The portions here are huge (which is a plus)!  The service def. can improve. I felt like the waiter did not check up on us often, also they seemed to be in a rush most the time. Other than that, I probably will be back!"}
{"text":"Fast service, good portions, very reasonable priced!! We got the Hakka noodles with paneer, and the vegetable pakora. Both which was delicious but I was especially impressed with the vegetable pakora!!   Came down to $20 in total and was more than enough food for two people with some left over to take home - what a steal!"}
{"text":"Was in the area so we dropped by for lunch. Same decor, seats and chairs are starting to look worn. It was not busy and able to get a seat right away.   Not sure why but staff seemed rather rushed and short today. Ordered a Chili Chicken and Crispy Beef lunch special. Food came as they prepared (not at same time). Chili chicken was rather bland this time, spice was minimal and I had to add green chili's to get more heat (which I never have done in the past). The Crispy Beef was on the minimal side (unusual as the plates are normally huge), we actually counted 8 small beef strips & the plate was mainly white rice with a frozen spring roll.   We asked the waiter about the portion and was told it happens, however, he did put in another order for more. The beef that came was much fresher in comparison to the one on the plate, wondering if we were served left over from a previous order? Overall food was okay, nothing stood out or recommendable, This time, we were not as happy with the lunch as usual.   NOTE: When we received the bill, we noticed that they slip in a 10% service charge in addition to the total. Careful if you plan on tipping as they already factored it in. Also, the credit machine does not allow you to skip tip so you must enter at least 0.01 to proceed. Lowered my rating as a result to reflect my overall experience and food quality."}
{"text":"Not anything special but defiantly worth a try. After a visit I could definitely say that the food is worth buying but the seating arrangement is horrible. Very wobbly tables and cold wind just ruin it for me.   Also our entire table was served room temperature soup which we had to send back to re-heat.   All in all, it's just another Hakka spot."}
{"text":"We love this place, best indo-Chinese food in GTA ..  the less expensive, tasty food and sufficient quantity we always ask for box.."}
{"text":"Great food - can't take spices that well but their Bombay Chicken was really good! Would come back!"}
{"text":"TRY THE BOMBAY CHICKEN!! The lunch deals are great and I've taken advantage of them quite a few times; service is not too smiley but they get the job done. Don't get the soup over spring rolls; we ended up with a thick mucus-like tasteless mess once and have never made that mistake again. Take-out is quick and easy and the inside is nicely upkept as well. If you're in the area, it's worth popping in just for the bombay chicken (dry, of course)."}
{"text":"Hakka Legend is our regular Saturday lunch place and it's my absolute  favourite because I can walk to the place  whenever I don't want to cook . I absolutely love every single dish on their menu . I would recommend their Bombay chicken to all those who miss the authentic Indian food . It's crispy and has the perfect blend of the spices . Their soups are made with loads of love and are a perfect blend of Asian flavours to all the soup lovers. The ambience is pretty decent and is spacious . The service is pretty quick even during the peak hours. I might never get bored of this place and I recommend Hakka legend to all those who love Asian cuisine!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken and beef were okay. Also ordered pad Thai; should have known better than to order a Thai dish at a Hakka restaurant! If you want legit Hakka food... Frederick's (down the street) is a much much better option."}
{"text":"Okay, so let me clarify. The one star is not for the food. Food probably deserves 4/5. Anyway, me and my girlfriend walked in for lunch today, and the place was not as busy as it usually is, so, we were welcomed pretty quickly and the guy brought us to a table. Nice! We ordered two meals and the rest is worth sharing in detail:  After about 10 minutes into the waiting, the television right above our table started playing very loud football streaming. Ignored it for a while until it got really annoying and I could barely hear my girlfriend talk. Two waiters right behind me, kept watching the football. I asked one of the waiters to lower the volume and I receive a blank look. Suddenly, one of them asks us to move to another table instead! Shameless staff. No respect for customers.  Not creating an issue, we moved quietly to another table which had another TV above it. Fortunately much quieter in volume.  There's more to it:  1) 10 minutes into the lunch and nobody bothers to ask if we need plates. I'm not someone who would eat noodles with another person right off the bowl! 2) When done with lunch, I have to wait for one of the 4 guys to look at me, and ask for the receipt. Every single one of them would look elsewhere and whenever one looked in our direction, they look straight up to the television on my head.  3) Finally, when I see the receipt, there's a $1.45 \"Service Charge\" on the total. Like, seriously?  Come on Hakka Legend, I've been to a 100 restaurants. I don't mind paying $2 more for the food items, but if you're charging people because they dine-in instead of take-out, you're losing valuable customers. Honestly, I wouldn't mind paying the Service Charge if the service was even close to acceptable! No excuses, they were not even busy. Just too busy watching football I guess.  A regular customer, never coming back again. Unfortunately, great food but terrible service."}
{"text":"Not sure if this was the location my fam and I went to but the food was absolutely amazing! I cant wait to visit Toronto again and have dinner here. 9 of us went here for dinner (5 Americans, 4 Canadians) after a days trip to Niagara Falls. We were still full from fries and pizza but we made space for food after hearing about how good it is.   First we ordered the chicken corn soup. My uncle chose it for us but I would've preferred a spicier soup. It was bland and the chicken was so chewy like gum.   We ordered chicken lollipops as appetizers. Id rate it more than 10/10. We always have chicken lollipops at Chinese restaurants in new york but these were the best we've had so far. The pink sauce was also similar to the one in NY but spicier which is better. Lollipop also had some cut chiles on the skin.   I forgot which noodles we ordered, I think it was called Hakka House noodles? Came with chicken, beef and shrimp. It was so good.   Chicken fried rice was alright.   We also ordered the chili chicken which was very good!   I was only able to take pictures of the lollipops bc my phone ran out of charge.  Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"My coworker recommended this place to me and we went there on a Friday for lunch. I was blown away by the seasoning on all of the dishes I had. We ordered the Bombay chicken and fish pakoras. Everything tasted delicious and the pakoras came with a chili sauce that was out of this world! The prices are really good too for the food that you're getting and the service was outstanding as well."}
{"text":"What to try: bombay chicken (dry)  What to avoid: sizzling mutton.  Think of bombay chicken as tandoori chicken finished in a similar manner as hakka chilli chicken. Does not pack the same intensity of flavour as chilli chicken but is a welcome change. Chicken pieces are large relative to other hakka places in town. Portion size here is smaller. Best bang for your buck still exists at Federicks.    A la carte orders are given with a small container of rice - other hakka places do not skimp.  Sizzling mutton has good flavour however the pieces are thin and texture is slightly gristly.   Will be back for the bombay chicken."}
{"text":"I have come to this location before for their lunch special and their food is usually average, but definitely meets that chinese food/spicy food fix. It is greasy, fast, tasty and has that chili kick to pretty all the dishes. Hakka food is a mix between chinese and indian cuisine. It is very cheap and you can definitely share a bunch of dishes with some friends. I always get their pakoras, chili chicken, hakka noodles and green curry. I was quite impressed with a chili fish dish and chili chicken, but the green curry was not what I remembered it to be. It was more mushy and not as tasty as I remembered it to be. The Hakka noodles were oily like usual, but very flavourful. Service is very quick, the table was not bad and comfortable but very busy and loud. They did not have any booster seats but did have a highchair for children.  I think the food is not as spicy as before, but the quality has gone a bit lower today."}
