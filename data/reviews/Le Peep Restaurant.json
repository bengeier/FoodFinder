{"text":"Today I drove 20 minutes just to visit this popular restaurant. The server's face was unbelievably cold. Their skillet is so so. Especially the waffle! The flour is not expensive, right? Why you put a lot of water just a little bit flour when making a waffle? The waffle is crunchy and very lightweight. The blueberries on the waffle taste so bad....Won't go there again."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Ordered the fruit cakes & they were totally uninspired.

Not so many breakfast places in champaign so it is what it is."}
{"text":"This gets 1 star because the food is edible. I've eaten here on multiple occasions because I wanted to give them a fair shake. Disputes ample opportunity, and a change in ownership, my opinion remains the same. This place sucks! The servers are rude, food is inconsistent and subpar. If you're thinking of going there, you're better off burning your home cooked breakfast. At least then you won't be antagonized by the person behind the cash register when you pay."}
{"text":"Got the Down Home County Pie more like Down Home Delicious Brunch!!! Also when that one dude said \"Le peep... Bon appetite\" he was right. Le peep be mine #wcw"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in C-U. Don't know why this joint isn't getting more love. Put that hollandaise sauce on my eggs....RIGHT NOW

Great coffee."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and the food is decent, but nothing to write home about. The staff is friendly, but I just expect better food for the price."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in CU. always had eggs Benedict. And they serve food fast. Sometimes I was craving for their French toast"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of egg's benedict, so when I finally went to Le Peep, I did not hesitate to order theirs. Sadly, the hollandaise sauce was too thick and completely tasteless. On the plus side, the eggs were poached perfectly. I wasn't impressed by their potatoes that come on the side either. My friends all enjoyed their different types of omelets, so if I return I would get one of those or maybe try the french toast."}
{"text":"The serving sizes were perfect, and the food was tasty!  I ordered an omelette called \"White Lightning\" with chicken, vegetables, and guacamole on top.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"With the full restaurant and constant influx of people Saturday morning for breakfast, I expected this place to be a no doubter. Instead, what I got was uninspired, run-of-the-mill breakfast that failed to meet expectations. I got an omelette with chorizo, something that can't possibly be messed up, especially in the chorizo haven known as Champaign. They messed it up. The potatoes were soft and mushy, and even the toast seemed a bit off. To top it off, as soon as we got our meal, we were given our check. Nothing says \"get out of here so we can get more money\" quite like that. For your money and satisfaction, you're better off going to Urbana Garden or the like."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 11 with no reservation. It was busy but we were seated within 25 minutes. The menu has a wide variety of breakfast foods. I went with the stuffed French toast. They have a flavor of the day and it was chocolate hazelnut. A few members of our group got pancakes and enjoyed them, though a bit dry. The eggs were good and the fruit was fresh. Only checkout was that check out was a bit chaotic."}
{"text":"I want to like Le Peep, I really do. It just seems every time I go, something isn't right. It's not a bad place: It has a charming, homey atmosphere, the staff is always pleasant (if a bit distant), and the food comes reasonably quickly. 
But that's where the aforementioned not-right-ness comes in: the food is just not great. I haven't tried everything, but it feels like they're cutting corners and doing it in all the wrong places. So on Saturday I ordered the La Petit French toast. I am guessing the 'petit' part refers to the amount of eggs and heat used in making the dish. In my cookbook, 'toast' should definitely have a bit of crisp to it, and French toast involves the use of eggs. This was more like 'heated bread'. I will cop to liking my french toast on the eggy side, but I could not honestly tell whether they used eggs or not. These reminded me of pancakes at IHOP: bland tasting black holes for syrup. 
Another reviewer said LP is like Pancake House only more expensive. Have to disagree with that: I have never had a meal I didn't love at OPH, and Cracker Barrel is soul food for this honky. Hey Le Peep, give your menu a once-over, and give the other guys a run for their money."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" place for breakfast. The food is always good, I love all of the skillet dishes! Smoothies are tasty too, my kids really like the Funky Monkey- a chocolate banana concoction. Waitstaff also always friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I now have a new favorite brunch place! The servers are great and all the food was beyond delicious! The atmosphere is a vintagey adorable! I had the Cafe Vienna which is espresso with steamed milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and whipped cream. Also had a cinnamon roll that was fluffy, soft with crispy edges, warm and buttery served with extra butter on the side. The  Harvest Benedict was just the right amount of veggies (mostly mushroom and bell pepper with some spinach) and eggs together with a light hollandaise on top of toasted English muffins. The Benedict wowed me in how it was presented, the size, and the taste! There was also potatoes on the side and \"sassy apples\" which are I think cooked in cinnamon."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a very bad experience at this restaurant.(6/19/2017) We were seated in a high traffic area. The hostess who also was the manager was very unprofessional. A kind considerate waitress started to move us to another area, when I overheard this manager say to another employee \"What a B--ch\". I stop in mid step, and was very upset by this. Absolutely disrespectful person. Never would I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Decent food, but not breathtaking. Service was excellent, and prices were also very good. I'd consider coming back to try something else."}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite weekend breakfast stops. the food is always top notch. the eggs benedict is one of the best i've had in town. service is fast and friendly. you never feel rushed. but get there early, the place fills up fast and stays busy!"}
{"text":"The food is standard and what you'd expect from a breakfast place. It comes out pretty quickly too. Nothing I've had is really exceptional to make it stand out from other breakfast places. The atmosphere is casual but not greasy. Service is always good.

They have\"lattes\" on their menu, but these are not made with espresso. I would have known if I had glanced over at their \"latte\" machine, the same kind gas stations have (I love gas station \"lattes\", but it wasn't what was expecting here.) If you want coffee, get regular bottomless coffee instead."}
{"text":"Best seafood omelet ever. Good service. Love having a water pitcher at the table. Nice, clean, just the right level of ambient music."}
{"text":"One of the better breakfast places in CU area (that we've found). Had a bit of a wait--went around 11am on a weekend. 

Flavored coffee was awesome. The French toast was above average. The skillet we ordered was good as well though we've had better (not in CU)."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something a little nicer than your typical ihop/Perkin's (yet still casual enough to go wearing just shorts and a t-shirt) , then I would suggest checking out Le Peep.

They have a varied menu with something for everyone, it's clean and open inside, they have outdoor seating for when it's nice out, service was good, and it's cheap!

My friend and I split a Nomad skillet and their Razzle Dazzle french toast (or something like that).  We were super hungry initially, but omg were we stuffed afterwards!  The Nomad was pretty good, but we agreed that the next time we came here, we would try something different. Same deal with the french toast.  

Definitely a good brunch place for when you're really hungry!"}
{"text":"Seems to me that Champaign-Urbana would be a great market for an outstanding breakfast restaurant, with all the visiting parents wanting to take their kids out for breakfast.    Le Peep isn't that place.  It fits well in the category of mediocre breakfast restaurants in Champaign.  The wait times are very long (and not accurately assessed by the staff) in a very small waiting area.  Add slow service, noisy atmosphere, and uninspired yet pricey food, and that all adds up to mediocre at best.  I'm still searching for an exceptional breakfast expericence."}
{"text":"Our family's \"go-to\" place for breakfast and lunch!  I specifically like the healthier items like the Spinnaker while the rest of my family goes for pancakes and french toast!  Yummy food and excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"The drifter skillet is phenomenal!  The skillet is filled with seasonal veggies, no grease, and the eggs are incredibly fresh.  

Our waitress was phenomenal:  super friendly and attentive, yet not over-bearing at all.  I can't believe this establishment is a chain?!  

We arrived around noon for brunch, this past Easter Sunday.  A great plan!  I'm wondering if they're BYO friendly.  I'd love some champagne in my OJ:)"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot. I love getting skillets for breakfast and the ultimate BLT for lunch."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here, having been to other locations before and always having a good breakfast.  This was a major disappointment.  First off, the staff was very nice.  However, the food was terrible.  I ordered a fruit and yogurt plate, and the fruit with the exception of the banana was all frozen fruit, which meant it all looked like a fruit pur√©e.  I've never seen a restaurant serve frozen fruit in a fruit plate before.  I also ordered an egg sandwich.  The eggs were definitely premixed, and that's not that weird, but there was something added to them.  The texture of the eggs was really tough and chewy.  I believe they were mixed with water and milk, I assume to use fewer eggs.  The bacon was thin and cheap, and the potatoes on the side clearly hadn't had their oil changed in quite some time.  I am really frustrated that I went out of my way to come to a place that didn't care about the food.  I observed the waitress say \"tell him to make the egg sandwich good this time\", which should have been my first clue."}
{"text":"i took my best buddy here for breakfast today.  i have never been to this specific le peep, but had sampled one in indianapolis that was good enough.  i figured i'd give the chambana le peep a whirl.  

the menu is extensive.  maybe a little overwhelming.  i find the less things on the menu, the better the food.  (concentrate your excellence, restaurants of the world!)  i ordered the \"wheat\" pancakes.  my friend ordered some sort of breakfast hodge podge called \"the eighteen wheeler\"..... the name alone suggests impressiveness.  she does not eat pork, and asked if anything could be substituted for the pork sausage included in the meal.  the answer was no, but for an extra charge, you can add fruit or toast or \"sassy apples\"... whatever in the hell that is.  substitutions are not a part of the extensive menu.  

our food came rather quickly for a sunday morning.  i was disappointed to find that my \"wheat\" pancakes were not wheat at all.  they were in fact regular old un-nutritious pancakes with wheat germ delicately sprinkled atop.  sigh.  the potatoes were okay.  my friend said her meal was alright.  nothing special, but nothing to really complain about.  

the waitress was nice and attentive.  she made sure our drinks were never empty and she was pleasant.  

would i return?  maybe.  maybe not."}
{"text":"Breakfasted at LePeep on Saturday.  Service was good.  The pancake special sounded delicious: bacon and pecan.  Ordered one.  It was okay.  The \"signature\" potatoes were dry and a paltry serving.  Other than there being something vaguely familiar about my waitress, it was an uneventful visit.  As I said, food was mediocre.  Won't try it again."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Interesting combinations that are delicious served in a cute and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the gypsy skillet and I thought it was dry. The flavor was good for the most part. The onions were overwhelming and there were too many potatoes and not enough mushrooms. I also asked for my eggs to not be runny and they were. In a skillet that can be gross. I only gave them two stars because that is what I truly feel. I might change my mind when and if I go back again."}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain.  The decor was very well done and the menu was expansive and well thought out.  Food was well prepared but a bit on the small side in terms of portions.  Wait staff was pretty good and friendly."}
{"text":"I've never been here before, but one of my friends suggested this as the traditional last meal before the drive back to Ohio.  
There was a 25 min wait which in my opinion was not bad. What breakfast brunch place doesn't have a wait on Sundays anyways. 
Once we were seated I gazed over the menu and became focused on the skillet items they had. Everything sounded tasty. I chose a sausage skillet plate that had gravy with a basted egg on top. It didn't disappoint. Upon delivery it was piping hot and visually pleasant. Each bite was good mmmm good. Definitely suggest this place for anyone in need of a good meal."}
{"text":"Their classic cubed potatoes are very very good. Their gypsy plate is fantastic. However, there are things to improve on that need attention.

One time we went there, our waitress said that they \"don't take credits cards at the table\", which is total BULL because all the other waitresses that served us there did. It seemed that she didn't feel like doing her job, or that she felt \"superior\" to us.


Another time, we learned through the manager that they carefully measure every portion of potatoes per plate...he said every plate \"only gets\" 8oz per serving. He wasn't so friendly and he cut us off while talking.

Today I went and got their Seafood Crepes for $7.75. The dish says it is stuffed with seafood...A total LIE.
It is ONLY stuffed with cheap *imitation* crab meat, wrapped with a couple layers of oily egg. Gross! If you don't know what imitation crab meat is, it's not real crab meat. You can get it under $4.00 at walmart!

Looking at the plate, I immediately realized they were not using real seafood, so I told the waitress Patti about it. Thankfully she was human and decent about it and did not charge us for the plate, in light of how the plate description was *not honest*.

We left and I am not sure I will be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Service was great, and you get your own pitcher of water and coffee so that you don't have to wait on refills. The Shamrock Eggs Benedict was a 10/10."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch places in CU area.Their brunch is healthier than many other local brunch places: less fat!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place, but I will not go there anymore. The waiters are rude and did not let me in, but the couple who walk in just 2 minutes before me get seated and they just refuse me. And such thing happened for two times already! The first time the waiter told me they are gonna close, and tell me to get there by a certain time next time. And next day, I get there by that time, they still tell me they stop seating people( but the couple who walks in 2 mins earlier get seated) I cannot understand it. So mad."}
{"text":"The worst part of Le Peep is they aren't open for dinner, which only gives those of us who work during the week two days to enjoy all the delicious fare served up by Le Peep!

Otherwise, I can't complain. Have always had a good experience and their food is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where I only go if someone else REALLY wants to go. i always get the same thing, a chicken melt with onions and peppers. I could make it better, but it's been reliable. I am not an egg person, so I guess I am missing out? Coffee is not good. Usually crowded, and service is passable."}
{"text":"I'm new to town and was looking for a breakfast place that wasn't greasy. Le Peep has a great breakfast menu. The OJ is fresh squeezed, the pancakes large and tasty and the eggs and various breakfast meats cooked exactly the way I asked. 

The service was excellent and the price not too bad. I have friends coming to visit in 10 days and I will definitely be taking them to Le Peep for a breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Saturday morning with the girlfriend for a quick breakfast and had a kind of underwhelming experience. When going to a restaurant I usually want to eat something that deviates from the norm of what you have at other restaurants, or even make at home, but Le Peep didn't quite deliver that.
Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but there wasn't anything great about it. The atmosphere was your typical hustle and bustle of a Saturday morning breakfast crowd and the service was still spot on despite how busy they were, but I was hoping for something more.
We'll definitely come back, as I never want to judge a place on one experience, but we won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Le Peep is a solid breakfast/brunch spot, especially for Champaign.  I'm spoiled now, living in brunch-crazed LA, but when I'm \"home\" my parents often want to take me to Le Peep as it's become their fave for b-fast.

Their menu has a nice variety, but nothing too exciting.  This is central Illinois, after all.  

The biggest difference between LA brunch and Champaign brunch?  Grease.  Those midwesterners LOVE their grease.  My parents are born and raised C-Uers, and I have to giggle when they talk about how healthy the food is at Le Peep.  True, it's an improvement on most of what you'll find in the area... and true, the world of scrambled tofu and turkey bacon is quite a different one, so not an altogether fair comparison... but it's still funny to me."}
{"text":"I love traditional diner breakfasts, but in this town, it's not so easy to come across. I found this place essentially by accident, after a friend and I were looking for a place to grab a quick bite on a Friday morning. The decor is, what I can best describe as, cute, and has a real homey but clean feel. I ordered the eggs benedict, and was not at all disappointed. The portion was big, the ham actually tasted like ham, and the potatoes were scrumptious. There was even hot sauce already on the table! My friend got a raspberry crepe, and it was more the French eggy-kind than the pankcaky one most people are used to. The berry compote was nice and the sour cream was a fun touch. Would I go again? In a heart beat! And bring several friends with me!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the gravy. Tasted like canned.  Very good service and wonderful atmosphere"}
{"text":"Food is awesome! French toast and peasant potatoes are delish!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 6/5 stars if I could! La Peep does everything right. The interior is decorated with a French Countryside theme, and is casual yet classy. They have gourmet dessert coffees and brewed coffee specials that change daily. They even offer you a coffee to take home when you leave! The waitstaff is always friendly, knowledgeable, and pleasant. Our waitress Molly was especially so. :) 

Now, the food. People often say \"Everything I've ordered from here has been good.\" Well, everything I've ever had at La Peep has been FANTASTIC. The presentation is spotless. Every plate is beautiful. And the FLAVOR! The fruits and veggies are always super fresh, and spiced dishes are just the right amount of spice, while sweet dishes aren't overly sweet. They've never messed up my eggs. Also the bacon and sausages are HUGE and will satisfy any meat lover.

Basically, La Peep is the perfect brunch spot. The fact that they're almost always busy is proof of how amazing they are. I love it, and hopefully you will too."}
{"text":"The service has always been fine, and they're actually super accomodating for big groups. I don't think the wait has ever been ridiculous when I've gone, but of course there's a wait on Saturdays and Sundays. That's when people go out for brunch!

The Irish Benedict is amazing. Two toasted english muffins topped with corned beef hash, a poached egg and delicious hollandaise sauce? Can't beat it. 

My brunch motto is: everything with hollandaise sauce, hollandaise sauce with everything.

Coffee is kept fresh and warm. A great place for breakfast or brunch in the Champaign-Urbana area!"}
{"text":"Very normal, there really wasn't anything outstanding. The do leave the coffee pot though, and it is pretty cheap. Definitely seems aimed at the older crowd."}
{"text":"Always delicious food, staff is usually very kind and warm. Can be a little bit pricey, but is worth it. Good selection and combinations of items too"}
{"text":"Although the price of the food and service was great, the taste of the food was just okay. The menu was extensive but what I ordered was nothing special."}
{"text":"Visited Le Peep yesterday (5/2/2012). 

Both I and my guest experienced marvelous food. She had an homestead eggs Benedict and I had a standard ham and cheese omelette.  Pictures of both were taken and uploaded. Hers looked fantastic.

My omelette was excellent. Light and fluffy. Melty  cheese that was great. And the ham was great. I tend to like my ham chunks to be more substantial... It didn't take anything away from the omelette at all.

The servers were nice and we got a pair of them as one was in training. We were treated like royalty. No complaints.

5 stars."}
{"text":"This is our favorite brunch place in Champaign..the wait is a bit long but it's worth it..the food comes pretty quickly and the number of options in the menu is huge! This time we ordered the Harvest Benedict and the Hobo Banquet skillet and they were both pretty tasty..you have to order their orange juice and the dessert crepe!"}
{"text":"CHAMPAIGN BREAKFAST GEM.

I personally get the Eighteen Wheeler - a lot for a good price. & I like french toast.
They have amazing pancakes and omelettes/skillets."}
{"text":"I haven't visited this CU favorite in years. I was in the area and had some time so I stopped in for breakfast. Service was excellent. Restaurant atmosphere was bright and cheery, clean. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet. It's was a nice portion size, good but lacked a wow factor. Tasted a bit bland. Toast was over cooked. Potatoes on the side were flavorful. I will be back but might choose a different entree."}
{"text":"This is the sort of breakfast place to which you can take your parents and grandparents when they are in town visiting for the weekend. A nice, clean and classy environment. The portion sizes are reasonable--not the overwhelming heart attack of a meal you might get at Original Pancake House--and always delicious. In particular, they make a mean Benedict. Coffee is good, and they actually serve espresso. The prices, admittedly, are...well...pricier, at least for the area and for what they serve."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place, but not as good as Courier Cafe in my opinion!  The three of us at breakfast today agree the blueberry pancakes at Courier are far fluffier and tastier.  My Spinnaker omelet was good, just met expectations.  Huevos rancheros were a scramble, not the usual presentation of eggs easy over.  No rice or beans either.  Still tasty though.
     My daughter in law said its really just a fancy Denny's.  Pretty good analogy!
     Service was fast.  Good breakfast place, not spectacular."}
{"text":"This is a solid place and I don't understand why it's gotten such bad reviews! It's a lovely place for brunch... the garden egg white omelette was yummy and  the coffee acceptable. Overall,  i  like!"}
{"text":"Champaign has many little hidden gems to find and Le Peep is one of them. I came here for brunch with a visiting friend from the air force, and he recommended on coming here as this was his favorite place to eat during university.
They have a large selection of brunch items; all decently priced and good portions. I ordered the Belgium Waffle Combo and it came with eggs, choice of meat, and potatoes. Most other breakfast places you would have to order these items separately or as sides, which adds to your bill. But this combo option at Le Peep was just perfect.
The downside of Le Peep is that they do not give military discounts. Also, my friend and I sat outside where there were spider webs everywhere on the table, chairs, etc. I know it is inevitable to encounter bugs when dining outside, but a little keen observation when cleaning the tables outside should be in order."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a waffle in champaign.The service is good and the food is always yummy"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here after every horse back ride and it just makes the day so much better. The atmosphere is definitely more upscale than a greasy spoon but the cooking feels much more down-home. I've never met a bad wait-staff or hostess here. On Saturday, even with a line out the door, we are usually sitting not long after arrival. I love their waffles and I can't stop ordering that punch drink they make. Also, grab a glass of the raw cider. It's intense. 

Absolutely love Le Peep"}
{"text":"The southwest omelette was delicious. Warm tortilla to accompany the green chili and salsa was a good addition. Large portion and eggs that were cooked perfectly for my taste. Great service too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. This is my new favorite place in the CU area. I got the banana walnut pancakes with a side of links and eggs. This are the best pancakes that I ever had!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I don't believe I've given a 5/5 before but this place is worth it. I don't know why it's taken me so long to try it but boy do I regret the wait! My girlfriend got the blueberry pancakes which I tried a bite of and was blown away, mind you I'm not a big blue berry fan but I would order these any day. I ordered the Wanderer skillet; peasant potatoes, onion, tomato, bacon, cheese and topped with two basted eggs! Tons of bacon!!!! This is the only place I've seen basted eggs, the skillet was amazing. On top of it all we got out with a bill of 15.74 for the two of us! PHENOMENAL!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite breakfast place so far in Champaign. I am a huge fan of their skillets, and the Desperado (potatoes, chorizo sausage, green chilies, onions, homemade salsa, and cheese) is the best one that I have tried there. The service is decent, but sometimes it feels like they are rushing you out even when it is not that busy. This is definitely a favorite location for the elderly in this town, so it is a good place if you want a quiet breakfast.

They also have a punch card that gets you a free meal after 8 visits."}
{"text":"Awesome, affordable brunch experience in Champaign-Urbana! We've come here a few times and it's always worth the wait. Our waitress always accommodates allergies and special requests and with such an expansive menu, there's something here for everyone! Their stuffed french toast is big enough that you can even share it with someone else. Don't forget to ask for their punch card...after 10 or so meals at Le Peep, you get one free!"}
{"text":"Oh my god. This is one of the best breakfast places I've ever been been to. Their food is seriously yummy. I was skeptical at first because the outside looks like it could be any old strip mall restaurant, and the interior design is poor. But the concept is very interesting. It looks like a quaint kitchen, possibly decorated by your blind grandmother. Green walls, light wood, valances, Art Nouveau posters. Like, REAL ugly. We sat at the breakfast bar and it was like sitting in someone's house. Looks aren't everything.

We got the coffee, the biscuit and gravy side, Nomad skillet, and sausage pie skillet. All phenomenal. I had low expectations for the gravy, and when it came out I fell in love with it. I had no idea gravy could be that good. The skillets were beautifully presented and 10 levels tastier than any of the breakfast options in Chambana. They really know how to make a good skillet."}
{"text":"My husband and I were frequent visitors to La Peep and had their frequent diner card. Things were going swimmingly well - we used to go there on Fridays after dropping our kids off at school. We have had this tradition for the past three years. Today we decided to bring our children for the first time and of all days had the most horrible customer service from the server Michelle. The neighboring table thought she was being absolutely out of line with us and started to complain to another server and Michelle arrived then, got involved and would not back down and it became an argument between her and us (with our neighbors speaking for us). Right in front of our kids !! We were mortified. When we complained to the hostess Karyn or Karen she basically waved it off Then she told the girl who was ringing us up \"Take off a coffee or something\". She seemed resentful that we had brought it up. We did not want a coffee or anything taken off and we protested and told her that a polite acknowledgement is all we wanted. She then apologized for her behavior but the damage was done. The whole episode has made a really bad impression on us. 
We understand that it is hard to keep it together on a Sunday morning when it is really crowded and busy, but politeness needs to mandatory for an establishment that serves people. Clearly the culture in this place is one of anger and resentment. I doubt that we will ever go back there. Shame because it is on the way and we really liked the eggs benedict there."}
{"text":"While I'm giving it 3 stars, all we had were 4 Crepes: the Denver, the seafood, the chicken and the Aspen for dessert. All the crepes were more eggy than pancakey. It overwhelmed what ever type of crepe you got. Most of what you tasted was egg. The dessert Aspen crepe was also just OK, it was a plain eggy crepe with fruit toppings. That's it no sweet sauce or anything else to decorate."}
{"text":"Had the seafarer!  Yum ! It was a very good price (a little over $7) for an omelette,  peasant potatoes , and an English muffin. Good breakfast place after a party at a college town!"}
{"text":"Le Peep is a charming place with a solid menu for breakfast, brunch, lunch. Even my picky eaters seem to enjoy this place. Their skillets (I recommend the Wanderer) & omelettes are great savoury choices. I like their waffles. And the pancakes are always fluffy. I recently discovered their smoothies, which are so good. For those of us non-morning people, you can order a \"bottomless\" carafe of coffee so we can face the day with some semblance of alertness. When it's nice out, there's outdoor seating. Plenty of parking. All these wonderful aspects make this a popular place."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today and the food was delicious. I had french toast and it was very tasty. The orange juice was very good and not watered down like some restaurant orange juice can be. The only slight issue was that the \"child's\" portion of french toast was exactly the same as the adult's portion of french toast. My child couldn't finish all of it so it had to be wasted due to us not being close to home. They do not have apple juice only \"unfiltered apple juice\" that they call apple cider. The bathrooms were very clean. They serve Breakfast, Brunch, and Lunch. They don't serve dinner."}
{"text":"Compared to the other breakfast places in the area, I really don't think the savory meals stack up. I've had a couple omelets and skillets here and wasn't particularly impressed by either. The service is nice, which is a positive. Next time I come here, I'll try something sweet and see if I can find something unique."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. 

Had the Harvest-something-or-other(english muffin topped with cream cheese, fresh veggies and poached eggs--hold the hollandaise, please!) which was so great! Very fresh and tasty. Not to mention filling. Had a few bites of the accompanying potatoes, not my fave, but I was too full anyway. They had a wide variety of dishes, and many healthy options. 

My only complaint was the \"fresh squeezed\" orange juice. At  four bucks a pop for a large glass, I'm better off getting a half gallon at the Jenifer Street Market back home for double that price--and it's SO much better."}
{"text":"The food tastes fine but my experience was the wait staff was just ok.  I also felt like the portions, particularly on the sandwiches were small and left me wanting significantly more.  I felt for the cost the portions weren't reasonable."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, I was a little bit scared of the wait to get seated, since I came with a party of 15 people, and the place was PACKED. However, they definitely worked super fast and we got seated in less than 30 minutes. 

Being a big fan of American dining, I had always be using skillets as my control group to test the quality of the restaurant. Hearing only good things about this place, I had relatively high expectations. And long behold, this place does not disappoint.

I first ordered a strawberry creme smoothie. It came in a chilled glass mug. Upon first sip, I could taste the strawberries. Not many restaurants can do that. Within a few minutes I decided to order the Blarney Skillet because I am always a sucker for corned beef. The food was served within 10-15 minutes. And Dear God, did the combination of both hit the spot! The skillet itself is not greasy, yet you feel like you are eating something substantial. The taste of the ingredients are further complemented by the hollandaise sauce, which was mixed with the two sunny-side-up eggs to perfect the combination. 

The waiter/waitresses were very attentive. They constantly swung by to ensure that we have enough water as my buddies and I just chatted after we finish our meals. They were super polite and gives great insight when asked to provide recommendations of items on the menu. 

The best part about this place is probably the price. The two items: smoothie and skillets, came to a combined total of approximately $12 including tax, which is not bad at all! I would highly recommend this place if you have a mean of transportation to get here!"}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast. Nice service. Delish food. Only issue I had was no bike parking."}
{"text":"This  is a solid low price breakfast place. I like the mini omelets. Good service and good food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch place in town. There is always a wait for this place but it's totally worth it. They have variety of brunch/breakfast options. I really enjoyed my Seafarer omelette with English muffin. The omelette is very tasty and with those breakfast potatoes, it's perfect. Every time I visit, I love to have their Belgian waffle with strawberries bananas and whipped cream... it's delicious! Although the restaurant is always crowded, their servers are quick and attentive. A great place to hangout with friends or family on a weekend brunch with some amazingly tasty food!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast   Service is good and friendly. Food is good. I'm stuck on the granola blueberry pancakes but the folks I come with enjoy a variety of dishes. I like to build my own omelette. And they are very accommodating. The coffee and help keeps coming and I never feel rushed. The outdoor patio is very pleasant in warm weather. Not noisy. Clean restrooms. Pleasant staff."}
{"text":"This is like the equivalent of Egg Harbor of the suburbs. A lot of flair, but nothing there!

Anyways, I went on a Sunday morning. The service was great, the coffee was fantastic, and the wait was non existent. A good start to the meal!

I usually get the 2 x 2 x 2 (pancakes, eggs, and breakfast meat), but with school starting tomorrow...I decided to do something different.

I decided to order French Toast, the \"Le Petit\" option. It came with bacon (which they gave me sausage instead for some reason...crisis averted later, but I digress). With my bacon in tow, I also asked for some strawberries on top. I got two eggs scrambled on the side, too. So I guess I got the 2 x 2 x 2 just under a different moniker. 

Needless to say with the order mess up, I wasn't shocked to find that the food was \"Meh\". If you're in CU, stick to Original Pancake House or Cracker Barrel for eggs and oatmeal. I wish I went to one of them today instead!

I also tried to \"check in\" here, but my phone didn't let me...come on Le Peep!

Hey, I've got a secret. You can't say a peep to anyone you know who likes this place. 

There are better options around. I wish I tried Sam's Cafe today instead!"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast food. I had some sausage and potato skillet smothered in gravy and topped with runny eggs. Yum but it was 95% potatoes. Coworker had something hollandaise and said it was average. Pancakes are average. 

Service is quick and friendly though. It's a good find for breakfast in this small town."}
{"text":"Came here after Original Pancake House was too packed, was craving for a delicious Sunday brunch and Le Peep definitely delivered. Got seated immediately and ordered a stuffed French toast (flavor of the day was chocolate chip). Great French toast, very filling and tasty. Also tried the garden omelette which was very light and also delicious. 
Unfortunately the coffee was sub par, but most diner coffees are. 

Overall, the service was great and food was good, and the comfortable, happy atmosphere of Le Peep definitely makes it worth visiting."}
{"text":"Le peep is one of the best forgotten restaurants in champaign. It gets drowned out by the original house of pancakes which is a shame because it is very good. Although prices may be a little higher than they should be, Le Peep always delivers a quality product! Try the Wanderer Skillet!

EDIT* 12/9/16

Moved from a 4 star to a 3 star. After a couple times of eating there recently it just seems worse over all. Still good but not worth the elevated price anymore to me."}
{"text":"Pretty good for breakfast. One caveat: I and a friend went there for breakfast today, and I took a gift certificate for a free breakfast for one. When we arrived, a gift certificate was posted on the window saying they no longer honor them. Something about \"corporate policy\" and a change in ownership. This is against the law."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and excellent food. Pecan coffee was a nice added touch. Sir Benedict Omelet was delicious."}
{"text":"There breakfast is great, low price with tons of food, nice food. We tried omelette, egg Benedict and pasta. All are nice, especially the omelette, enough soft egg flavor."}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago and totally forgot to review it! I ordered the traditional eggs Benedict which comes with potatoes and \"sassy apples.\" The food came out very quickly and was amazing! The hollandaise sauce was extremely zesty and flavorful, the eggs were cooked perfectly, and the ham was thick and delicious. The only bad part was that the potatoes were pretty dry and almost stale. I do love the service here and appreciate that they left the coffee pot on the table so that I could refill it as I pleased."}
{"text":"Better than IHOP by far. Basic good food. I had the ham melt without mushroom and tomato. That's just what I got. My husband got the Denver skillet ($7.50). I tried the potatoes in it and they were good. I had the raz ma taz smoothie and it was great. We had a coupon so it was worth the visit. 
They didn't get 5 stars because their online menu and their actual menu don't match."}
{"text":"Le Peep is Mario from Super Mario Bros. 2. Mario is not as fast as Toad, doesn't jump as high as Luigi, and doesn't float in the air like Peach. That is why I never go back to Le Peep. Merry Ann's, Sam's Cafe, Pancake House and Courier Cafe are all better than Le Peep in one way or another, be it speed, price, quality, or selection. 

Le Peep is fine, especially for a chain, and offers an interesting variety of items for higher than average prices, but it ain't gonna wow you."}
{"text":"There aren't too many good brunch spots near campus, so I was happy to find Le Peep. Friendly service, good food, and fair prices. Their menu is huge and everyone I was with enjoyed their food. It's nothing to write home about, but if I lived in the area, I'd probably be a regular."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by Le Peep's brunch. The dining room is cramped and busy, but the service is friendly & efficient. We had some trouble deciding what to order off their never-ending menu (not a complaint!), and I was really happy with my granola blueberry pancakes. Sounds strange, but what a great idea to put granola in/on pancakes! I like that each table gets their own pitcher of water, coffee, hot water for your tea, whatever you happen to be drinking. I'd definitely return to Le Peep in the future."}
{"text":"Not too bad!  I've been largely disappointed in the breakfast/brunch options in town, but Le Peep did a decent (if not outstanding) Eggs Benedict and Biscuits and Gravy."}
{"text":"I grew up in a large Midwestern city that featured more than a few Le Peep locations. When a younger man, I didn't care for Le Peep. It might've been the decor, but it was mostly the \"bird food\" fare. 


Well, some 25 years later I tried Le Peep again. Holy cow, they have excellent food! My personal fav is the Blarney Skillet sans peppers and onions. It is the absolute bomb. Wait staff is friendly. Service is excellent. I am back, and incredibly happy to be back!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience at Le Peeps! The staff are overly friendly and bring a smile everytime!  Food is is always delicious!"}
{"text":"If you want breakfast, this place is perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. Good prices, endless coffee, friendly and fast. Just what I was looking for. Recommend the Southwest Omelet. Best breakfast in the area."}
{"text":"I think you're either a Le Peep groupie or you're not. I'm not. I'll go there, and their food is alright, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in C-U and reasonable price. Waits on weekend after maybe 9. Cheese eggs are great!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent Le Peep. It's reliable food, but nothing great or special. The food doesn't have too much flavor to it, and if you get over that, it's decent.

The last time I went, I only wanted to go because I had a free meal to redeem from the punch cards they have. Now, I had two different cards with punches that both added up to a full card. You would think that they could add those two cards together to redeem my meal. However, when I was at the stand to redeem the card, the host wouldn't let me because the punches were on two separate cards. She told me that she could combine all of the punches on one card for me so that I could come back the next time and redeem it. That was SO generous of her. When I grudgingly paid, the host also looked at the signature line of my credit card that said \"SEE ID.\" So, she asked me, \"Do you want me to look at your ID?\" I answered no. She asked the same question to the lady behind me that paid. I'm pretty sure that asking that question defeats the purpose of writing that in the signature line. I'm not one to even care if people check my ID, but phrasing a question like that just showed the ignorance of the employees at this restaurant.

The servers have always been nice, it's just the hosts (and manager I believe) that were incredibly disappointing. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Le Peep numerous times, and I find the food consistently good, the waitresses friendly, and the atmosphere very pleasant.   The food is reasonably priced and I like it that there is an outdoor patio to sit out on as well on nice days.   I also like it that they use egg whites in some of their dishes if you are watching your cholesterol.   A wonderful place to meet blind dates too.

{"text":"Le Peep is my go-to Sunday brunch place if I can't decide what I want. It's just a regular pancake house with better food quality. I think the food is reasonably priced and the service was always good. They have a punch card so make sure you ask them if you don't have one!

I always order the Blarney Skillet with hollandaise sauce on the side. The hollandaise sauce is actually the highlight of my meal! Basically anything from the skillet section is amazing. Expect ~30 mins wait on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Can't say I understand the scathing reviews either...I had heard good things about this place, so I did what any dutiful Yelper would: I looked the place up, read the reviews, and was convinced that my friends were all liars =P  Well, one emphatic endorsement from a classmate later, Helen and I grudgingly came here for Sunday breakfast...and were totally shocked to see how crowded it was at 10 am.  The place is clearly a local favorite, and the egg white omelette I had was perfectly serviceable.  Maybe August was a bad month, but at this rate I'll definitely be returning for my brunch fixes."}
{"text":"Nothing bad, nothing great. Breakfast, an omelet, was very average and the service was fair.

Being a chain Le Peep is a know quantity and reliable. Reliable, as in average."}
{"text":"This breakfast spot had big shoes to fill. The Le Peep up near Northwestern was one of my favorites. The menu was a bit pared down compared to its northern counterpart, but it had all the usual egg, pancake, and crepe dishes. You can also get flavored coffee, though with a few less options.

I went for the irish benedict and a cafe mocha. Both were about on par with the usual high standards that come with the name. One issue was that the poach was perfect on one of the eggs but a little overdone on the other. Not a huge deal, but the yolk mixing with the corn beef hash is the star of that meal. 

The only thing that makes Le Peep lose points with me is that I got tagged a little extra for exchanging the ever-present diced potatoes for fresh fruit. After corn beef hash, an english muffin, two poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce the last thing I need are these dry, starchy and very overrated potatoes. I'm used to asking for fruit instead, and this is the first time I was charged extra. Wasn't happy about that, but it doesn't change the fact that I'll be back here pretty often."}
{"text":"Originally I would have given this place 4 or 5 stars.  I used to love getting the Rainbow Veggie Melt with no cheese (lactose malabsoprtion) or the Hobo Banquet with no cheese.  I'd also get the potatos or side sald.

However, I've had additional health problems and have identified more food allergies/triggers.  I went to the location in CU and requested 2 eggs cooked in plain oil, side of potatoes, and a side salad with no cheese and oil/vinegar for dressing.  The potatoes are prepackaged and seasoned with onion powder.  Onions have been identified as my biggest allergy.  I asked if they had any other potatoes they could cut up and cook in some oil and was sadly told no. I asked if I could have a side salad with extra veggies.  I also asked if there was a possibility to get the chef salad with no meat and substitute the imitation crab on the salad. I was told no to every possibility I came up with.  The server seemed annoyed and didn't assist me with any other options.  I ended up with 2 eggs and a bowl of plain oatmeal. 

I know with allergies/food triggers, we can be annoying customers.  However, we often are willing to pay more and tip more if we are treated respectfully and the server/chef help make our experience a positive one.  My family loves this place so I assume I'll have to go back, but otherwise I wouldn't."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Indiana locations.  Service was a tad slow.  But breakfast is breakfast.  I was with four others, and we all ordered something different."}
{"text":"I just went there for a quick waffle. Arrived 15 minutes before they close. Now when I arrive before closing at a restaurant, I'm not unreasonable. I understand people wanna get out and go home. I walked in and the manager looked at her watch and said \"ok but we close in 15min,\" to which I responded \"right.\"
She replies, \"ok well I don't know if we have any tables.\" There are like 10 customers there still eating. She says \"let me go check the kitchen.\" At this point I'm about ready to leave, but one 'nice' employee says \"don't worry they'll figure something out. I think they're in a hurry for some wedding.\"

Ya I'm in a hurry too. I just wanna eat something and go study.

So the manager begrudgingly says ok we've got a table. \"and you're sure you can be in and out in 15.\" I gave her a death stare, closed my eyes, took a deep breath, pointed to the table, and she said \"sorry sorry, I know we're just in a hurry.\"

I don't say a single word except for my order. A waffle.
My waitress comes puts some syrup on the table, doesn't even acknowledge me.
I ate the waffle, drank my water, took my bill to the front, and there were still people seated btw.

As I pull out my payment, the original \"nice\" employee\" says \"thanks for being fast and...\" I immediately cut him off.
I raised my left hand up, closed my eyes, said \"stop talking!\" Obviously, no tip. And I left and will not be returning.
P.S. The waffle was Terrible."}
{"text":"The food was edible, and the restaurant was clean and bright. The waitress was nice enough, but when I asked for a recommendation, she pretty much told me everything was good and the omelettes are popular, the skillets are popular, etc. I ordered two pancakes to feed my baby and asked for them plain--they came out with a big scoop of butter on them. My daughter's funny face pancake was cute, but the fresh fruit wasn't exactly fresh, and there wasn't much of it (two canned pear slices, two canned (?) blueberries, and a little sliver of strawberry). My skillet was pretty good, but small for the price and the English muffin was coated with some oily substance (despite the waitress asking if butter was okay)--whatever it was, it wasn't butter. I had the vanilla hot chocolate and it was sickeningly sweet, I didn't even finish it. Although it's close to us, next time I'd skip and hit up Courier Cafe instead."}
{"text":"After eating here almost every other weekend and trying out other breakfast places in Champaign, I have come to a conclusion that to me this is the best breakfast place in Champaign. First of all, this restaurant has a homely feeling to it, which is alleviated by the amazing service. You feel welcomed here. Food is great too. Love the harvest Benedict, skillets and pancakes here. It gets crowded on weekends but I don't mind the wait. Also, if you come after 12 pm, wait time is less."}
{"text":"Le Peep is a chain found all over the place, but it took a 16 hour road trip for me to try it in Urbana.  It's quite an alright breakfast place.  The omelettes are quite good, and it's pretty affordable - all in all a solid breakfast place.  If that's what you're looking for, then there's no reason why you shouldn't come here."}
{"text":"The Nomad skillet is one of the more unique skillets that keeps me coming back to Le Peep. Where else are you going to find a skillet with broccoli and sliced almonds, smothered in a tasty hollandaise sauce? 

The house potatoes are pretty standard - slightly crisp and chewy on the outside while soft in the middle. 

There's a bottle of Cholula at every table, for those of you looking for a little kick. The English muffin isn't anything special. 

Overall, this is a place where I would return to meet friends, but probably wouldn't seek out otherwise. If you do go in a large group, be sure to start a punch card. You only need 8 punches for a free entree!"}
{"text":"I was impressed by this restaurant. The food was good and the service was excellent. The waitress was attentive and quick to take our order. If you order coffee, you get an entire pot. Even if it is a single order. The waitress also offer To-Go containers for our drinks. I would come here again."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, I have to say. The skillets are unique and pretty tasty, and they have some nice lunch options. At least, it looks like they do, who comes to this place for lunch anyway!?

However, if you're talking pancakes, there's only one spot you should be going and that's the Original Pancake House. Their sausage is also much better. But if you're into more unique kinds of breakfast foods, Le Peep might be just for you!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get brunch. More specifically, this is the place I go to fill my craving for french toast. Their stuffed french toast change different flavors-- from raspberry to chocolate chip, cinnamon raisin apple and more. Their skillet omelettes remind me of the ones served at Steak n' Shake, however Le Peep is less greasy. 

The menu itself is amusing: everything starts with \"Le,\" even when it isn't necessary. I sometimes find the restaurant's decor confusing, struggling between an American brunch place and a French cafe. Regardless, it's still rather homey. The wait's usually shorter than OHOP, although it can get pretty long on the weekend (~30 mins). They're good on refills and the service has always been friendly."}
