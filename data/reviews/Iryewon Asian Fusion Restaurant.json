{"text":"Food - 3/5 Service - 1/5  Food is OK.***Their Jajang Myeon noodles & Kam Pong Shrimp are good!*** (I mean, It is Korean style Chinese food restaurant... and you can't really go wrong with these simple dishes. This place just happens to be the closest Korean-Chinese restaurant to where I live. If it wasn't for the location/convenience, I would drive a little further down to go to Sunny Dragon instead and get a better service for the same quality food.)  SERVICE is their #1 issue. ALWAYS. Seriously understaffed restaurant...Wait, actually, it really isn't understaffed for the size/number of tables in the restaurant. I know this is mean - but I just think the servers who work there are not very smart and they just work really inefficiently. On busy evenings, they mix up orders (really?) and take forever to bring out the food  (on avr. 30+ minutes). & Other tables that were seated WAY after us got their food before we did. Same dishes. Like, really? How does it work that way?   I've raised the concerns with the server & manager ahjumma lady but they were just like: ¯\_(?)_/¯... which made me even more angry.   Bye Iryewon.  Your service sucks."}
{"text":"Was craving for Korean Ja Jang Myum. So my Korean friend recommend this place to me. First time here, the place was very packed. Seems very popular. lol We ordered Ja Jang Myum, Spicy seafood noodle and sweet and sour beef for two person. The Ja Jang Myum was very delicious. The Spicy seafood noodle was quite spicy but delicious! The sweet and sour beef was very crispy. I like their noodle very much. And their spicy crispy chicken looks so yummy. Will definitely go again soon."}
{"text":"portions are always filling and the service is good.  The price is reasonable.  Only thing I would be aware of is that most of the dishes come with the same seafood (mini shrimp and mini octopus) which can sometimes taste a little fishy and/or similar amongst all dishes.  Overall it's a great restaurant-one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"I am not writing this review based on just one visit. I have been here multiple times throughout the paat 3 years, but I will no longer come back.   Food: 1/5 Disgusting. Their fried beef (tangsuyuk) was not fresh at all. It was cold, and tasteless. Their jjajangmyun was also bad. Noodles were overcooked. Almost every single food was overcooked. Fried beef was smothered in tasteless batter.   Service: 0/5 Poor service. Do not expect any service from this reataurant. They do not give you any service but expect you to tip LOL. The owner (asian lady) will give you a great attitude and throw a reciept at you.   Also, this restuarant is so gross. Sticky chopsticks, plates that are not properly cleaned ( like i can still spot red pepper/stain from the plates wtf). And they never said sorry for any of these situation. It is obvious that the restaurant is not clean at all, and I am wondering why this has never been reported to food police.   Oh yeah, the owner lady is also very very impolite. When I told her about the food, she told me that I was the first one who's complaining about the food and gave me very rude attitude. Like at least say sorry..?    Go to other restaurants. Save your money and time."}
{"text":"Champong is fantastic if you don't mind waiting for ages. Service is slow and inefficient and you routinely have to line up for ages because the food comes out in odd spurts. It is common for some in your party to finish their meals before the the food for others even arrive. Champong is especially slow for some reason. One would think they always have a vat of the soup cooking, but it doesn't appear that way."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Iryewon (Man Ri Jang Sung) Cuisine: Korean Location: Thornhill Address: 100 Steeles Ave W Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4  Service: 3  Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Korean-Chinese style   I really don't understand why this restaurant has 2 different names. Also the fact that the names are both Korean and pretty long does not help me make it less confusing. Why they are called IRYEWON as well as Man Ri Jang Sung is just beyond me. Anyways, I decided to visit this place after my friend highly recommended it for Korean-Chinese style food.  There is no ambiance at this restaurant, you walk in, you order, you eat and then walk out. They have couple rooms avail for group gatherings if you are interested. They have specials throughout the week as well as combos if you want to try different things.  Ordered: Sam Sun Bokeum Bap (RC08) 1/5  * Plate of seafood fried rice served with spicy soup for $9.99 * This fried rice is served with black bean sauce that you are suppose to mix with the rice * Usually the seafood would be fried together with the rice, but this was regular fried rice with shrimp and squid on top * Resulting in shrimp and squid pieces that were kind of cold and flavorless * They threw on some random pieces of cabbage on top which made it really difficult to eat * Fried rice was overall tasteless, it def helped to have black bean sauce and the spicy soup * This was probably the worst fried rice I ever had at these type of restaurants  * I left more than half of it, I will never order this again  Ordered: Kampung Shrimp (PR01) 4/5  * 15 pieces of Sweet & Sour prawns for $21.99 * This was the highly recommended dish by my friend * I usually love deep fried shrimp and the Kam Pung sauce so I was excited to try this * $21.99 might seem a little pricey for 15 pieces of deep fried shrimp but this was very much worth it * Prawns were huge and fresh out of deep fryer, then covered with the sauce * Sauce was sweet and sour with the right sticky consistency * I liked how the prawns were big in size, but made it a little hard to eat * This would be good to share between 2~4 people   Ordered: Sam Sun Ja Jang Myun (N003) 3/5  * Bowl of seafood, beef and black bean sauce on noodle for $7.99 * I could tell they don't use MSG here because all their dishes didn't have strong after taste * All of the dishes tasted quite mild which I wasn't used to (my tonque has been trained with MSG) * Noodles were chewy and the black bean sauce was filled with seafood * Their black bean sauce was little on the runny side since it didn't have big chunks of beef or onion pieces * Another solid dish  Summary: If you live near Steeles and want to try Korean-Chinese style food, this place is quite decent. Just don't order the fried rice and you should be fine. I liked this place if it wasn't so far from where I live. If you don't want to travel so far up north, try Ding-Ho in Christie which is just as good"}
{"text":"I had Jajangmyun and Kkanpunggi. I used to recommend everyone for the best tasting jajangmyun in town, but I was actually disappointed to learn that they no longer had the flavourful black bean sauce that I used to love. It tasted bland. The Kkanpunggi had too much batter and not enough meat that it almost seemed like they were skimping on food. The servers were friendly and prompt, but I was no longer impressed by the food. I may come back, but I don't think I will go out of my way to recommend it to others :("}
{"text":"One of the best jajangmyun i tried in toronto. Price is reasonable and the black bean noodle is just amazing!!! I would definitely go back to this pace! The service was just ok.i went around 3pm, they weren't busy at all.. Food came out within five minutes, was fresh! I want to go back as im writing this review! Yummm"}
{"text":"Best restaurant for chinese/korean food. Jajangmyun is my go-to menu and my family and I always get the course menu which have all been great! I like the jajangmyun, champong, nuruengjitang, tangsuyuk, kampungki, and the stir fried veggies, beef, and shrimp with steamed buns.   As everyone else mentioned, they do always seem understaffed so service isn't the best. I just tolerate it since the food is irreplaceable."}
{"text":"You're honestly going to have a hard time finding an amazing Korean-style Chinese food restaurant in all of Canada, especially if you've tried the jjajangmyun in Korea with their super fast delivery services. Hence, I rate this place four stars because it is up to the standards that I perceive to be appropriate.   I'm more of a jjampong person to be honest and the soup base they have here is quite flavourful. Spicy, savoury, and they provide you with A LOT of seafood. Only thing? I love carbs :$ and they lack with providing you enough noodles. A few bites and I find myself left with a bowl of soup and seafood (which is also awesome if you think about it)   Another favourite dish of mine is tangsuyuk which is crunchy pieces of fried pork topped with veggies and a jelly-like sweet and sour sauce. A small size here is enough to share between two people if you order another entree such as jjajangmyun. One downside to how they make it here is that the sauce tends to be way too sweet, so I find myself scraping off the sauce before I eat each piece.   They also have daily specials so make sure not to miss that in the front page of the menu!"}
{"text":"Known for jajamyun and jjampong, they also have tansuyuk and spicy version here. Solid food :)"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for jjajang myun in Toronto, and honestly, the taste is up there.  Only problem is it really does make you feel greasy and heavy after eating, but there are no better places for black bean noodles in Toronto...that I've found.  When I visited Korea I compared the black bean noodles to here, and I honestly preferred this place everytime for TASTE.  The delivery black bean noodles in Korea didnt make my tummy ache however.  Make sure to eat these noodles with the onion and it'll help offset the greasyness!  I recommend takeout so you can use half the sauce for the noodles, and refrigerate the rest to mix with rice the next day!"}
{"text":"Very busy on a Sunday afternoon, likely from the church crowd. Like the popular SongCook, this restaurant specializes in korean style chinese food. I ordered the jajangmyeon which is on special for $6.99 on sundays (if I recall correctly) and was a fantastic deal! My boyfriend and I also split the steam buns, which chinese people know as man tou. Instead of eating it plain or dipping it in condensed milk like I'm familiar with they had the store bought thai sweet chili sauce to go with the buns which I thought was novel and delicious. My boyfriend ordered something that came with the jampoong soup and that my friends was the star of the show. The restaurant was generous with the seafood in the soup, and the soup itself was extremely flavourful without being too spicy for me. It was so good I'd like to go back and order it even though jajangmyeon has always been my go to dish at korean chinese restaurants. And the icing on the cake was that portion sizes were great and prices (with the exception of dishes like the tang su yook) were very affordable. Overall great place for lunch/ dinner and a good alternative to Song Cook which is nearby."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Korean restaurants and there's really nothing special about Iryewon. I definitely don't think it's worth the long wait. Other than their champong, nothing really stands out to me. Their jajangmyun is OK (nothing special), definitely prefer SongCook's. Also, their shrimp fried rice is legit 85% cabbage straws, and 15% rice."}
{"text":"Food was good. Very tasty.  Staffs were courteous enough but I think they were extremely busy.  Went as a big group and ended up getting a separate room. Unfortunately, the room (door closed) got really hot though. And the bell to call on the staff was missing."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant, the service is great every time I come to eat here and the food never disappoint. The black bean noodle is definitely better than most of the places I had ate at. The sweet and sour pork and spicy garlic chicken is so delicious. The portion is big even when it says \"small\" on the menu. Me and my friends always end up taking home about half the portions in a take of box home cause there were a lot left. I read some reviews about the stale batter from the other yelpers but I have yet encountered this experience so I have nothing to criticize about this restaurant. Definitely coming back for more. On a side note, this restaurant does get really busy on most days , so make a reservation if you don't want to wait in line and stare at people eat delicious food while you are hella hungry standing by the door with drools down your mouth"}
{"text":"Returned here recently and something has changed... The dishes lacked a bit of consistency . It was still quite tasty but there were slight misses.  The pork was somewhat lukewarm just heated by the sauce and the noodles lacked flavour.  I wonder if it's because we came late around 8pm. I hope this place turns itself around as consistency is key in any restaurant business."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times. If you want authentic jajajangmyun this is the place to go. Service is horrible, my last visit, waitress totally screwed up the order. She sent out two dishes for a table of four. Instead of apologizing and promptly fixing the order she mumbles something and goes back to the kitchen. Needless to say we left half full as another order would have taken 30mins. My advice don't go when it's busy."}
{"text":"My family have been visited this place more than 5 times because they used to provide tasty food. We went to this place again from downtown all the way to uptown to enjoy our dinner today. However, their food, service, and cleanliness was terrible. And how they treat their customers who complain for their disgusting food was also terrible.   Terrible Food 1/5 We ordered the jajang myeon noodle, sweet and sour pork (tangsuyuk), and spicy seafood noodle (Jambong). Jaajang noodle was soggy and overcooked so that it was hard to eat. Sweet and sour pork was not crispy and crunch and overcooked as well- which means they did not cook when you order it. It has been done before you come to the restaurant. My family was very disappointed because the food was not the same as we visited last time.  Unsanitary dishes 1/5 I am wondering they actually pass for the food safety patrol or anything like that because every time I visit there their dishes and cups are dirty. I had to ask the server to change cups or dishes every time. It was not my first time to ask for this but it has not been changed at all. It was very disgusting that I can see red peppers and oil in the dishes.   Customer service 0/5 Don't expect good customer service at this place. The server won't say sorry when you ask to change the dish or complain about the food if there are any problems. When we asked for the bill, we complained about their disgusting food and dirty dishes. The lady who look like a manger in the restaurant said no one complained for their food but only us. NO ONE APPOLOGIES when the customer complained at their food. We stopped complaining about their service and food because we knew that it won't change anything. We just paid the full amount of money including tip (what is the tip for? Isn't it for the service of the restaurant? Yes, we gave them 15% tip for their poor service).   I will never come back to this place and won't recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you really want to go this restaurant, do not expect good service."}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot because they served delicious kkanpunggi, jjajangmyeon and jjampong.   But last Friday, everything went downhill. Their kkanpunggi had the worst batter, it was extremely stale and they put a lot of filler inside. To make matters worse, there was a mint candy stuck to the bottom of my soju glass which we didn't notice because we assumed the glasses were clean. I only noticed afterwards when I drank from my glass and tasted mint. I was so disgusted because I pretty much ate someone else's candy that they spat out. Do they not clean their dishes/cups?? When we told our server, he only said sorry and just brought over a new glass like it wasn't a big deal.   They need to have a health inspection because now I question the cleanliness of their kitchen. Very disgusted."}
{"text":"Poor service. Staffs were very rude and mean.   ......................i wont recommend this place   Sdsssssssssjnmmkkkmmmkkkkkkkddddddddddddssddddssssddhuuuuuiiiqqqgy"}
{"text":"This place always hits the spot for my jajangmyeon cravings! Actually, I don't think I even had those cravings till I tried out this place. I looove the consistency of the noodles, the perfect amount of chewiness and I love how long they are too! The sauce itself is so good too, I love all the onions and just overall how flavourful the sauce tastes - the noodles also grab onto the sauce real well.   Every time I go, I see people ordering this fried meat looking dish so I decided to get one of them myself this time. They have a variety of these fried meats and I got myself a sweet and sour chicken. The first few bites were really good and crispy but as the night went on, it got a bit soggy in the sauce so I'd recommend getting sauce on the side if you like a bit of crunch with your meats.   This place is real Korean though. When we looked around, we noticed we were the only non-Koreans at the whole restaurant that day. You know you've found a gem when that happens :).  I knocked off a star because it was so Korean that all the servers only spoke Korean and seemed to favour Korean customers. We waited over 10 minutes when we went up to the front to pay. The cashier took customers that were behind us first because they were able to communicate better. Regardless though, the food hits the spot and I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pretty interesting place for Korean style Chinese food. We decided to try the jajangmyun which is a koreanized black bean sauce noodle dish. Although not the most pleasant looking dish the janjangmyun was actually pretty good. The black bean sauce looks a little mushy and it is hard to see what it inside. The noodles are the white wheat flavour thick noodles which were cooked nicely with an al dante texture. The black bean sauce that came with the noodle was a little runny but not as salty as I imagined and complimented the noodles well. Although the noodles were tasty it can be kind of plain as it is just black bean sauce.  We decided to try the Tang Soo Yook was pretty good as well. This is the Korean version of deep fried pork with sweet and sour sauce with vegetables. The portions are good for sharing with at least 4 people. I found the pork to be a little dry, 70% sweet 30% sour and vingar-y. There are a lot of pineapple chunks in it as well which I like. I believe they added some honey in it as well which made the dish sweeter than usual, but all in all it was still pretty good.  As for the dumplings they are your standard dumplings that are fried with pork in it - not too oily as well.  In terms of the atmosphere it felt korean-chinesey as well as normally I find that Korean restaurants would serve water or tea in a plastic jug but this time it was served with the white tea cups. For the cutlery it was regular chopsticks as well instead of the long metal stainless steel chopsticks and spoons  3.5/5 for food 3.5/5 for service. Nice place to try if you want to try out some Korean Chinese fusion"}
{"text":"So Lex has no made this her favourite restaurant which says a lot given she is under 10. She lives the sweet and sour chicken and the fried dumplings. The spicy seafood soup noodle is really good as well."}
{"text":"Champong was delicious.  Broth had a lot of depth, seafood (squid, primarily) cooked perfectly, tender and not too chewy.  Did not get the usual mussel in a shell which I kind of missed somewhat.  Noodles perfectly cooked.  Panchan was usual offerings which one gets in Chinese-style Korean food restaurants, i.e. kimchi, onion with black bean sauce and daikon radish.  The jajangmyeon looked divine - lots of people ordering it.  All ages to a background of K-pop!  Reminiscent of our favourite Chinese-style Korean restaurant in Chungmuro in Seoul.  We will definitely be back.  The tea was also good quality and the service fast, efficient and friendly.  Only criticism:  music was way too loud."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times by recommendation from a Korean friend. The Jjamppong and Jjajangmyun are very delicious. It's even better when they're cheaper on the special menu days (rotates every other day). The portions are very generous. I usually share 1 dish with my friend. It's $5.00 (Jjajangmyun - Tues,Thurs, Sat, Sun) and $6.99 (jjamppong - mon, wed, fri).  However, I was a bit surprised at their dish with the steamed buns (I think it's Kochu Japchae)... it was super pricey!!! That dish alone was $20.99 on the special... very little meat, mostly peppers and some other veggies. I'm guessing the expensive part was the steamed buns... 'cause those looked really intricately made.  I think there are actually several pricey dishes they serve on their menu. I'll just stick to the affordable menu items.  In general, I really like their dishes (jjamppong and jjajangmyun), and their service is friendly, but I don't think I can come here without my Korean friend. It seems like the servers don't speak English, and there is no translated menu..."}
{"text":"This place is so hyped up on the jjajeongmyeon. Other than the jjajeongmyeon , there were nothing else good. The fried pork and chicken were not crispy at all. The flavour was just okay."}
{"text":"This restaurant known as Man Lee Jang Sung (translated as the Great Wall) is super popular among Koreans. I was here on a Sunday evening and we had to wait about twenty minutes before being seated. Throughout our meal and as we were leaving the restaurant, people kept coming in and waiting in line. Maybe the restaurant could invest in expanding its business. They normally do not take reservations for dinner but I heard you can make a dinner reservation if it is made a week in advance.  We had sweet and sour pork (tang su yook), kan-poong shrimp, spicy seafood noodle soup (jam-bong), black bean noodles (jajangmyun) and hot pepper glass noodles (gochu japchae) which comes with white and soft buns. Sweet and sour pork, kan-poong shrimp and hot pepper glass noodles dishes were amazing. Their sauce on sweet and sour pork was different from the usual sour kind. It was darker in colour as well. The sauce used in kan-poong shrimp tasted similar to ones used in Korean spicy fried chicken, yum. I didn't like their jajangmyun as much, because the black bean sauce tasted a little too strong. I prefer the sweeter and softer taste of jajangmyun from places like SongCook.   The food here is by far, the best Korean Chinese food Toronto can offer. I've had better Korean Chinese cuisine elsewhere, but in Toronto, sadly, this restaurant seems to be as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Best jjajjangmyun in the area (maybe all of toronto?). I come here all the time with my family and take guests here. The service is slow sometimes and the ambiance is casual. But it doesn't matter because the jjajjangmyun is delicious and affordable. Other recommendations are the kkangpoongi, tangsooyuk, and any of their combo deals."}
{"text":"What a nice restaurant.   I give this place 3.5/5 because of the service. Although there is a bell placed in the rooms, it can take a few tries before you can get a hold of somebody. It can take even more tries before you actually get what you asked for.   I went with two other friends for dinner Friday night and were promptly seated in the room. We were given a teapot and a jug of water. We ordered a plate of tangsooyuk and jampong (the seasonal special that's on during the summer).   The tangsooyuk was a good starter - fluffy with covered in a sweet sauce. I wasn't expecting much SK I was pleasantly surprised. The jampong was amazing. The flavour is lot more intense than the average bowl; it had more spices and more depth in the broth. Be warned though - it is very spicy! We went through two jugs of water.   I highly recommend this place to fans of jampong! I haven't had a better bowl in North York. If somebody knows a place with a better one, please let me know."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Korean restaurant that serves jajang myeon noodles, I've tasted so far. Close by to Galleria and Song Cook. It's nicely hidden in a row of shop lots which assuming seems nothing interesting.   The sweet & spicy chicken however was interesting. It tastes a little too sour to my liking and no spiciness at all.  They have small private rooms and if it gets busy could be understaffed. But the efficiency of the staff is amazing when they clean and clear up the tables. There are no bills splitting over the weekend when it gets busy."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for about 5 years since my parents love Korean-Chinese fusion food.   First thing first, food is amazing. There's nothing to complain about the food.  However, I took off 2 stars for service.  Their quality of service has significantly declined over the last few years.  Despite the lack of service, I came here last night with my mom. It took 5 minutes for someone to notice and seat us, even though the servers made eye contacts and walked past us multiple times.  During the course of the meal, no one came by to check up or to refill water. We had to get up and tag down a server to get our bill.  No \"thank you\"s, \"good-byes\", or even a smile.  I wish they trained their employees better, then I would give them back the 2 stars!"}
{"text":"Iryewon Asian Fusion Restaurant is really a Korean Chinese restaurant.   This place is really busy as I arriving to a half full restaurant on a weekday for a late lunch and more and more people kept coming in even after I leave. Most of the patrons here are Koreans.  The menu consist of Northern Chinese dishes but with a Korean twist. There are English description on the menu.. but not on the Today's Special page which are all in Korean.. trying to figure out what is today special can be a challenge when one don't even know which is the Korean character for the day of the week.  Banchan is a little different than the usual Korean restaurant because aside from kimchi, there is this raw onion which I suppose to dip it in black bean sauce and eat that.. to give me the onion breath!  I decided on the Jjamppong ($7.99 special at $6.99) which is a spicy noodle soup with seafood  flavoured with onions and chili oil. The broth is not too spicy though it looks really orange. The noodles are really good.. chewy and a little transparent looking I wish there are some more. There are tons of squid (they are quite tender), a big shrimp (not good, mashy texture), smalle shrimps and little mussels(the frozen type)  There are a lot of privacy since there are high partitions set up between the tables and there are quite a few private rooms for groups.  The service here is quick and friendly.  They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Came here because of a jajangmyun craving and I heard it was the best place in the area, and I completely agree!  A regular bowl of jajangmyun was only 6.99 but some of the other types (seafood, fried) were 8.99 which is still extremely cheap. The bowl was pretty big even for the regular one, and I had to pack home half of it. Usually I don't like how leftover jajangmyun tastes but it was still awesome!  My friend had the jjampong, which I'm not usually a fan of but it was actually pretty good here too. It was also really cheap ($8.99). They have other items on the menu like Korean sweet and sour pork, which has a small option at $13.99 (I think) which I will definitely come back to try.  The service was pretty slow, but I'm not sure if it's because we had an awkward seating spot that was a bit hidden. It's hard to complain when it's so cheap and yummy though!"}
{"text":"This was my first try at try at Korean-Chinese food, but I had heard a lot about how good this place was beforehand so I had high expectations. It did not disappoint! This place always seems to be packed no matter what time of day. We finally got in and ordered kanpoongi and gan ja jang. My date ordered jjamppong, which I thought was extremely spicy. The kanpoongi was spicy too but only a bit. It was delicious and so was the gan ja jang. The portions are massive too! The service is a fast, but very loud. Specifically, there was one guy who was yelling a lot. The only part of the food that I didn't like was the side dishes."}
{"text":"Iryewon Asian Fusion Restaurant (Man Ri Jang Sung) was recommended by none other than Justine (@foodigatorJ aka my go to anything Korean bestie) when asked for a place for Spicy Korean Seafood Noodle.  This place is known for their Korean Chinese style food! We arrive at around 1:00pm on a Sunday and the place was packed, we had to wait in line but fortunately it's pretty quick. We were seated within 15 mins. They have a bunch of combos available but it was only in Korean, so no idea what kind of deal they have but the rest is in both Korean and English.  Side Dishes : Kimchi, Raw Onions, Black Bean Sauce & Pickled Raddish  Kam Pung Ki ($16.99 Small) ~ Sweet & Spicy Chicken ~ Love this, perfect sticky sauce and mostly brown chicken meat (white meat tends to me too dry)  ~ This is pretty mild, so wished it was slightly spicier.  ~ Need to come back for dinner and get this with soju or makkoli.  ~ This also comes in Large for $26.99 which is huge when I saw another table ordering it.  Ja Jang Myum $6.99 ~ Veggie, beef and black bean sauce noodle ~ Rather mild which I love (no msg or overly salty) with just the right chewy noodle but though the sauce was a tad runny since it didn't cling to the noodle very well which less us with a lot of it at the end after finishing the noodles.   Sam Sun Cham Pong $10.99 ~ Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup w/ extra seafood ~ The regular one is only $8.99, I really don't find there's much seafood but mostly veggies so I would say we could have save that extra $2.  ~ This is probably their signature dish since everyone was ordering this and it was on a poster.  ~ Love the flavorful seafood soup which was not the slightest bit salty, the healthy non-msg version of a Spicy Instant Noodle ~ Same king of noodle as the black bean which I like, would be great if there's more al-dente options as well (something more ramen or instant noodle like).  Verdict: ~ Loved it, although the selections are limited. ~ Would definitely come back especially to try the Sweet & Sour Pork which I saw a lot of people ordering and look super yummy."}
{"text":"Finally, a Jjajang place that is close enough to buffalo, NY. Their Jjangppong was probably one the best Jjangppong I have ever had, and I've had a lot of Jjangppong in NYC areas. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"There are so many Korean restaurants that are operated by Chinese folks.  This is the opposite...a Chinese restaurant run by Koreans.  Well sort of...K-peeps have their own spin on C-Food. JjaJjangMyun - Black Bean Noodle, JjamPong - Hot Chilli Seafood Soup with Noodles, TangSuYeok - Sweet and Sour Pork, GoonManDu - fried dumpling, and a host of other dishes await your hunger pangs. The place is usually packed throughout the afternoon and early evening.  Today was no different.  We got our seat quickely but service was slow. Food was A-OK. Cheers."}
