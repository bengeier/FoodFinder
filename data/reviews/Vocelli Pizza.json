{"text":"I'll start with a caveat-- I didn't even get to eat the food, so my rating is all about customer service. Maybe the food is fine. I'll never know because I will never order Vocelli's ever ever again.

At 8:05pm I ordered a large pineapple pizza from Vocelli's through GrubHub.  At 8:20pm I got a call from the delivery guy, telling me he was outside my house. Weird, right? Can you even make a pizza in 15 minutes, let alone deliver it? When I got back inside, I opened up the box to find a pepperoni pizza that sure looked medium-sized. 

So, I called Vocelli's to let them know I had been given the wrong pizza. They just asked my address, and when I told them they said \"you ordered pepperoni.\" I was 99% sure I had ordered pineapple but I thought it was possible I had checked the pepperoni box by mistake. I looked up my GrubHub receipt while still on the phone, and told her my receipt definitely said pineapple. She insisted, defensively, that hers said pepperoni. She literally was like, \"well my printout says pepperoni, I have proof.\" To be honest, at this point I was just confused since a) obviously something is wrong when a pizza is delivered in 20 minutes and b) even if it was GrubHub's fault, shouldn't they offer me a replacement? and like, you know, apologize? Instead, she asked if I wanted to order another one. Like, to pay for a whole other pizza. I said no, and told her I'm vegetarian so I can't even eat the damn pizza. She didn't really seem to care. She told me, again, that her printout said pepperoni, and that it was GrubHub's fault, not hers, and that I should just call them.

So, I did. GrubHub called Vocelli's on my behalf and apparently they confessed to the GrubHub customer service rep that they had screwed up the order, and they (finally) offered to make me a new pizza. I'd already ordered another one from a different joint, so GrubHub got me a refund instead.

And so that is the story of how I got my $13.95 back and how Vocelli's got a one-star review and my undying hatred."}
{"text":"Great pizze should diventy try try the cheese sticks"}
{"text":"ALWAYS our go to place.   Can not go wrong.  Five stars- any less, you ain't gettin it right.  The end."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery, a large two topping with pecorino Romano and pepperoni as well as bread sticks. Got the food and not only was there no pepperoni at all on the pizza, the bread sticks were barely cooked dough that moved like overdone spaghetti. We ate the pizza because we were so hungry and it wasn't bad, just not what we ordered. Will pass up next time."}
{"text":"The pizza is always good. Our delivery order today was somehow lost. They made it right by calling us back appologizing and delivering a free pizza.  Good customer service."}
{"text":"They have tiny little pepperonis that crisp up, awesome! Service was polite, pizza was on time and delivery man was funny."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing. The Vocelli rolls are really good as well. The staff that answered the phone and the delivery driver were polite and professional. Great pizza place. Better service than the Washington store for sure."}
{"text":"If all you care about is a hot pie then you have absolutely no taste. The service was par, but slow considering we ordered delivery from down the street. A cheese pizza is easier to make than teen pregnancy. The only thing that I like chewy is a four foot tall Chelsea Handler side kick. Ranch nor wine could save such a poor demonstration of corporate mismanagement. I highly recommend Pizza Romano in Oakland - ask for Lexi."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 lg pizzas yesterday, was really impressed after not having it for several years!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed when we received this delivery. We opened the box to find an unbelievably thin and dry crusted pizza- not the usual vocelli crust. Honestly questioned if it was bought from a grocery store. Do not believe the 1 am close- apparently they stop caring some time around 11 pm. No doubt, worst pizza I ever had and will never order from them again; should have went with my first choice and ordered from mineos instead of giving vocelli the benefit of the doubt. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Told me they had a big order and would be 30 minutes, then was a little more delayed but offered a great discount on the pie. The best part though, was the Pizza! Chicken carbonara was awesome! And the bread sticks were seasoned just right. I would eat there everyday if I got the same discount."}
{"text":"I've found myself craving Vocelli's several times. The food is decent. Personally, I've had both the pizza and the wings in the past. They weren't the best pizza and wings I've ever had, but like I said, they were decent enough for me to crave them on a couple different occasions. 

Vocelli's is also convenient for the college crowd. Both Carnegie Mellon and Pitt work with them so you can pay using Dinex or Panther Funds. They're open late as well, so that's definitely a plus."}
{"text":"We placed an order for a pizza tonight at 8:01pm and it arrived at 9:30pm. When the order was placed we were told it would take 45 minutes. We live seven minutes away. The pizza was completely stone cold and looked like it had been sitting around the entire time. I called the shop and spoke with Amber Petrelli who apathetically told me \"We were busy.\"  I explained that our pizza was completely cold, and she responded \"It was under a heating lamp.\" Wow! Terrible customer service. She never even apologized. Even though the thin pizza is tasty, we won't order from here anymore."}
{"text":"I was on a business trip and after along day of traveling I just wanted some food delivered to my hotel.  I ordered a small Quattro cheese from the menu which was a 10\" 6 slice pie. It was delivered fast and I was pleasantly surprised how fresh the ingredients were. The crust was cooked perfectly and The pecorino cheese made all of the other ingredients that much better. After a long day Vocelli's gave me a perfect  ending to a long day and one of the best pizzas I have had in a long while."}
{"text":"Stopped by the other day to grab some grub before the Steelers game. I had a double pepperoni pizza a side of Garlic Parm wings. Both fantastic. Pepperoni is super crunchy. 
The garlic parm roasted wings were the best part. They cook them roasted in the oven and use similar sauce to the breadsticks, unreal. Ill be back for sure."}
{"text":"Tried to order online - 2.7 miles away - claim they won't deliver.  Call the store - say they will deliver (and who wouldn't - they are less than 3 miles away) but won't honor any online promotions.  Amateur hour - call Angelia's or Dominos - deal with a professional....."}
{"text":"This place has been in the area as long as I can remember and every time my parents ordered to when I ordered for myself it has always hit the spot. Wings are great too. Very different style and if you're a wing person you'll appreciate them! Pizza is always good obviously. Staff always friendly."}
{"text":"Great pizza this week. The best I have ever had from Vocellies. Received it hot and on time?"}
{"text":"Worst Management and Customer service I have ever experienced! Rude employees, rude management. Received the wrong order and was told that not only was there nothing they would do for me to correct the situation, but was then told that it was not their fault I couldn't use my computer correctly."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 pizzas to our hotel on Saturday night around 12:30am. Person on the phone was super nice. Man who delivered pizza was prompt and pizza was fresh out of the oven so hot and delish! Great service especially for that late at night."}
{"text":"Worst pizza and service I have ever experienced! Ordered a pizza and salad for delivery. An hour and 15 minutes later a completed haggard delivery driver showed up without the salad, pizza box half crushed and a cold pizza. To top it off the pizza wasn't even cut into slices. Do yourself a favor and buy a frozen pizza and save the hassle!"}
{"text":"Their delivery time has always been very fast and accurate. I've never had any problems with receiving an incorrect order. 

However, that's only when they decide that they're open and delivering. I have literally called them several times now on a Saturday night around 11-1130 to order a simple pepperoni pizza only to be put on hold and then told that they were closed...at 11-1130pm on a Saturday night. When their website and store specifically state that they are open until 1am. It is the most annoying and bizarre thing I've ever experienced. And it seems to have become a common occurrence of theirs. I don't quite understand what's going on with this location but it's really starting to upset me. I'm almost to the point of contacting the store owner and complaining. You cannot pick and choose when you want to be open or not especially when everything states you are open until a specific time. I don't even live that far from the store (far enough that delivery is more convenient than carryout) and they know this the moment I call. I've always been a big tipper to the drivers as well because of how quickly they arrive with my smoking hot, perfect pizza and I've always been extremely polite to each one as well - so I'm not one of those dreaded customers. 

This is getting to become a little much and something needs to change - whether they change their store hours officially or actually adhere to what is currently stated. I've noticed that a few of the local Vocelli's customers are complaining as well - about different and similar things. So again, I'm not sure what is going on. But I wish Sewickley would get a decent pizza place that delivers and actually operates on the hours they have stated."}
{"text":"I order frequently from Vocelli's Swissvale.  They are consistent and quick, with convenient hours.  Once in a while the delivery person forgets something but goes back for it.  Its not worth it to get the colassal.  I think they use the same amount of dough as a smaller pizza, and spread it out until its too thin.  I like the spinach and mushroom pizza.  I got a special for my birthday- supposed to be a free one topping pizza if you buy bread sticks.  The pizza wasnt free- the discount left one dollar uncovered.  Then if you just order the med pizza and bread sticks, the amount is too small for delivery. Some present!  Anyway, I think the club panini is very good, as are the salads,  Cannolli are worth the price too.  Overall, I'm ordering from them again- and again..."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 baked steak sandwiches for delivery tonight. I have ordered here before and it was usually decent, nothing great but okay. The sandwiches were delivered in a decent timeframe, however the sandwiches had little meat and were so cold we had to microwave them to be able to eat them. I normally do not complain, however the food was so bad I thought I needed to call and let the manager know. I called and asked for the manager and was told I was talking to the owner. I told him that the quality of the product he delivered was bad and cold to top it off. The owner then told me he made the sandwiches himself and there was no way they were cold and had plenty of meat. I couldn't believe it! I told him I didn't expect anything from the restaurant but wanted to let him know I was very disappointed with the food. He still wanted to dispute my comments. I never write reviews but was so taken back by the way this was handled I had to say something. Once he realized I didn't want anything other then give feed back he did say thanks. I would not recommend this Vocelli's to anyone. I have had food from other locations and it is generally good. This one is the closest to me and unfortunately I will never order from here again and would caution anyone else on the Robinson PA area who does."}
{"text":"Ordered two meals, an hour later still no food, they called us asking if the address we put in was right. It was but they somehow messed it up. Thirty minutes we call asking when it'll be delivered and they said the delivery guy just left. We live 1.1 miles from the location we ordered from. 45 minutes post call, still no food. Horrible service. Definitely never ordering there again"}
{"text":"Everything is great about this place. The staff is nice and friendly! The food is always good..never any issues whatsoever. Delivery time I'm given is always 45 min but they are always there in 25. Quick, good, and consistent."}
{"text":"I just had a HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! We ordered delivery. They used to be my favorite. They are way overpriced. They charge for the cheese! The pizza was doughy, under cooked. They pride themselves on fresh ingredients. Well they must be outside catching pigeons, because they were the smallest wings I've ever seen in my life! I called to complain and they had a bad attitude. And offered no compensation. The cannolis are good, but they don't make them there."}
{"text":"Awful experience here. The delivery guy dropped our pizza when it was in the box and delivered it to us in a complete sloppy mess. They also forgot a calzone we ordered. Owner did nothing to make it right.

Stay away from this terrible place."}
{"text":"Awful experience here. The delivery guy dropped our pizza when it was in the box and delivered it to us in a complete sloppy mess. They also forgot a calzone we ordered. Owner did nothing to make it right.

Stay away from this terrible place."}
{"text":"I've never liked Vocelli's pizza anywhere, but the one time I ordered from them in Canonsburg they got my order wrong. No thanks."}
{"text":"so i ordered wings around 3pm today and the website said they would be delivered by 415, but by 430 i didn't get any email saying that it was even on the way. i called them (got put on hold twice of course), and finally when someone did pick up it was the rudest most obnoxious customer sales response that i have ever encountered. when i asked the employee why my order wasn't made yet, i received a \"yes, i got your order, i see it on the screen, i just didn't make it.\" and i asked him how long it would take for them to be made, and since he said it would've taken over another hour, i just decided to cancel, to which he replied, \"that would be lovely for me.\" so not only did i have to had wait two hours just for some wings, i had to deal with this very unprofessional asshat of a human being

honestly, vocellis pizza has really mediocre food and half of their business probably comes from cmu students because they're one of the only places that accepts dinex. it's pretty disappointing that they can't even manage to satisfy their small customer base."}
{"text":"My two experiences here show what a difference customer service can make: like night and day. Though my first encounter with a Vocelli employee was abysmal, my second interaction more than redeemed them in my eyes. 

A man who's name I shamefully can't remember called me out of the blue Saturday night and apologized for the extremely rude way I had been treated by his colleague, and then he asked if he could bring me a free pizza as an apology. I said yes, and not only did he show up with a free pizza, but he was delightful to talk to and the kind of representative any business would be proud to have dealing with customers. Oh, and also, he showed up with TWO pizzas, both of which were pretty good. Apology accepted, Vocelli Pizza, and special thanks to the delightful guy who I spoke with, who has transformed me from a boycotter to a repeat customer. 

Hopefully I won't have to deal with that jerk from my first encounter too often, but any business that stands behind both its product and its service the way Vocelli did the other night is the kind of business that's worth giving a second chance. Unfortunately the receipt only provided the name of the original jerk I dealt with and not the person from my last encounter, so I can't provide the name specifically. 

Hopefully Vocelli can find out who this lovely person was and reward him for completely turning around my view of this establishment!"}
{"text":"This is the best Vocellis I've ordered from.  It's always cooked perfect.  Bacon and Pepperoni every time. Only complaint is the price.  Damn that's an expensive pizza!!  Still got nothing on Pizza Company."}
{"text":"My first experience at Vocelli's Pizza. The pizza and wings were delicious. I will definitely return because good pizza puts a smile on everyone's face!! I ate at the restaurant and the staff were all courteous and helpful."}
{"text":"The owner will tell you all the best specials to make sure you're getting the most for your money. Always fast delivery and correct order. I love Vocelli's hoagies and breadsticks."}
{"text":"My friend was constantly put on hold when he tried to order for delivery when they just hung up on him. When he called back to order again, they said that they'll not accept orders from him because he took too long to provide his order information and hung up on him again. When he called them again, they said \"What did I just say when you just called me. I would be making so much more money taking orders from others than waiting for you to give your information\" in a very annoyed tone.

Really don't think this is how a business should be treating their customers."}
{"text":"I recently picked up a pizza here on my way to a friend's place one night. The guy on the phone was nice and helpful when I called to order. I asked if the pizza could be ready at a certain time because I was stopping in to pick up on my way somewhere- it was ready on time and paying for it was quick and easy. I did see a coupon online that they wouldn't accept, so I did have to pay a bit more than I had originally planned. The quality of the pizza was good- I went off the beaten track with some toppings (peppers, banana peppers- yum!), and they tasted good. I would order from them again, but I'd probably make sure I could use a coupon that they would accept."}
{"text":"Will never order from here again. When I placed my order at 11 am, it said it would be ready at 11:40 am. I received an \"out for delivery\" notification at 11:55 am. It did not arrive until 12:30. 
It's not even that great. Definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Bar none, worst pizza experience I have ever received. Pizza showed up BLACK!. Please DO NOT ORDER HERE. This was my first time trying this place. Also asked for extra sauce on the side, of course that didn't happen. Please save your money and do not order from this place. I have pictures to prove it."}
{"text":"Terrible in all regards. Delivery quoted at an hour, arrived 25 minutes late. Food barely warm. Pizza had scaly bits of crust on the bottom, like the dough was old or something. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Good variety of traditional pizza styles and prompt delivery. They also reward repeat customers."}
{"text":"I had ordered a salad from this location for lunch yesterday and the lettuce was brown. Very disappointed that they would serve lettuce line that and think it's acceptable. Not going back. This is the 2nd time I've tried posting this review. Keeps disappearing"}
{"text":"For take out pizza, it is difficult to find a more convenient or reasonably priced option in Sewickley Village. Lunch and carry out deals are usually available and pizzas are ready 15-30 minutes most every time they are ordered."}
{"text":"I was working late shooting a bodybuilding show for Muscular Development magazine and got back to my room famished and there were only Dominos Pizza flyers in the lobby but I wanted to try something local instead so called up Vocelli's to have a pie delivered.

Well the pizza arrived fairly quickly but man it was super greasy!  It didn't actually taste too bad but I guess greasy stuff can satisfy the munchies.  The price is right though and a good deal, but I'd suggest other options if I knew of any.  Not the best, but if you are starving and want something delivered this is one option..."}
{"text":"Pricing structure is expensive and often dishonest.  Ordering over the phone is frequently torturous as they seem unable of keeping employees past training period.  BUT - we usually like their pizza, subs and salads so we've overlooked these short comings, plus the delivery people are always very sweet - BUT TONIGHT was the final straw.  When I placed an order after receiving a 20% off coupon the manager told me he was unaware of the coupon.  He said the owner didn't tell him anything about it.  When I suggested he call the owner while I hold, he did and when he came back on he said that coupon didn't apply to this store.  I then proceeded to read him the part of the coupon that said \"This coupon is ONLY valid for the Greenfield Murray Ave store\"  he then disconnected me.  When I called back, he put me on hold for 2 minutes +/- and then when he came back on he said they would accept the coupon and the new price was $2 above the price he quoted me before I told him I had a coupon.  The MANAGER was who I was talking to and he was more than happy for this to be the last time we do business with them over $6 - even though we have been long standing regular customers.   Great Business Plan!  Never again.  If you order here be prepared to pay top dollar, often be mistreated on the phone and occasionally get less than adequate food. We're done."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff. Decent breadsticks. Cute pepperonis.  Fast delivery on Steelers Sunday. They accept cash or credit for delivery. Next time will ask that they cook the pizza a little longer for a more well done crust."}
{"text":"Just wanted to add this location to Yelp.  I've ordered from them countless times and have never once had a problem.  The pizza's always been hot and fresh and usually gets to my house in under 30 minutes.  They have online ordering now and I only had a problem once - the order didn't go through.  I called to check on it and the customer service rep not only found my order but gave me a discount that I hadn't seen when I ordered!  Great people, great pizza!"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery.  Decent tasting.  Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is seriously the worst service I have received from any takeout place. The order said it would be ready at 7:00 and I got there on time. The worker didn't acknowledge me standing at the register for 5 minutes and then told me the order wouldn't be done for another 20. She wasn't even apologetic. This happened last time we ordered from here and they got the order wrong. I thought we would give this store another try, but won't be back. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I hated this place as a kid, but I keep it in rotation as an adult. 

I always have my food delivered. The delivery guys are fine, not creepy like the domino guys. The food is always hot and looks tasty. 

The rating would have been higher if the prices were a little cheaper, they used to have great deals when I was an undergraduate. 

Sidenote- the wings are baked, so they are soft and saucy, not crispy.

The few times they have screwed up my order, they offered more food, but not a refund.

Worth a try."}
{"text":"This is a good place given a very narrow set of circumstances. I'd recommend getting pizza here if you're on foot, and in between bars downtown, and want a quick refueling slice. But this is a D) all-of-the-above situation. It's not \"quality\" pizza by any stretch -- too doughy for my taste and a bit too oily. That said, it does provide a wealth of calories if you're in particular need. If you are in a situation where there are other pizza choices, though? If you're ordering delivery, for instance? Seek sustenance elsewhere. There are better pizza joints that will come to you."}
{"text":"Love this little gem of a pizza place.  Pizza is crispy and full of flavor.  The pepperoni is smaller than normal but packs a higher qual punch.  Will def be ordering again"}
{"text":"This particular Vocellis is super FAST for carry out.  It must've been 15 minutes from when I put my order online to when I walked in and had a large pizza and cheese sticks waiting for me. The nice young man behind the counter even hooked me up with the special pricing that shaved a couple bucks off.  It was hot, delicious, exactly what we ordered. What more do you need of a local pizza chain?"}
{"text":"Good food. Plan on at least an hour and a half wait for delivery even if they tell you less."}
{"text":"This is a small take out location that is clean.

My service and food here have always been good.

I like the gourmet pizzas but I think this chain can have better crust.

I ordered a chicken spinachi with garlic sauce,  tomatoes, chicken and onions."}
{"text":"Great place-- our favorite place for takeout pizza. In our 50+ times ordering from them, the staff have always been kind and efficient."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this was my first time ordering from this location.  Ordering over the phone was quick and easy.  

My issue with this location occurred when I stopped in to pick up my order.  When I walked through the door, the man working the counter looked at me and said \"I guess you got the Eco Buster\".  Which was correct, however he did not bother to ask how I was or if I would like anything else, he just walked to the back.  So about five minutes later, the employee came back up to the counter and began ringing my order up on the register.  I asked for garlic sauce and the employee just looked at me and then proceeded to walk to the back.  Again, no reply!  Nothing like sure, absolutely or even just one moment while I go get that for you.  When the employee returned to the counter and provided me with a total, that was the end of our conversation.  No \"have a good day\", or anything like that.
Now customer service is what keeps me coming back.  This employee was anything but pleasant.  

Now on to the food.  It was just okay for me!  The white pizza had almost no flavor to it.  The only part that stood out was the steak hoagie.  If I decide to ever order from this location again, that's probably the only thing I would get again.  I would much rather travel to another pizza place than go back to Vocelli's."}
{"text":"Vocelli's used to be one of my mainstays when I was in my 20s.  In fact I hadn't been here since I was single and lived in the neighborhood.  But since I was in the neighborhood I thought I'd stop in and pick up a sub for lunch tomorrow.  Hey, they keep!  

Well anyway Vocelli's has your standard pizza shop fare.  Pizzas, salads, subs, pasta, appetizers, etc.  It's a storefront so they don't have any dine-in, just takeout and delivery.  I remember their pizzas as being really good.  You start by selecting your crust:  traditional, thin, pan, & neapolitan.  Then you add your cheeses and toppings.  I used to like mine with capicola & pepperoni.  They've since added gourmet (i.e. \"more fattening\") pizzas like barbecue chicken, chicken pesto, Hawaiian, etc.  

So I haven't tasted my chicken & pesto with roasted red peppers sub yet.  But man the thing's huge!  I ended up splitting it, giving half to my hubby."}
{"text":"They always get our order right and the food is always good. We've been weekly customers for the year we've lived here. Everyone always requests Vocelli's over the other two delivery pizza options in the area."}
{"text":"Literally an absolute waste of money. 

A ridiculously dry pizza with barely any cheese on it and some kind of thinly thin pizza crust...

Buffalo wings with barely any sauce...

Only reason they are still open is because Plum Borough folk looooove pizza. How do I know?
Look at not so Golden Mile Highway. There at least 6 pizza places on that one little stretch of road.

I paid $22 ($26 if I include the driver tip) for dry pizza and dry buffalo wings...

Will never ever, ever ever, ever ever order anything from that place again..."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the amount of bad reviews here. I always love their pizza and wings. Although there is inconsistency in quality of pizza sometimes, the wings are always good. Whenever I have pizza cravings this is my go to place."}
{"text":"Dude on the phone was cool, he kindly told us he had a coupon he could use if we wanted and was generally pleasant to speak with. It was a much appreciated gesture. Pizza was bomb too!"}
{"text":"Your above average Sunday night delivery order for the family as you guys relax. Delicious pizza and hoagies."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast delivery. Great pizza, they don't skimp on the toppings. Love the hoagies. So much good stuff on the menu. If you can order online, better coupons and join the club and cool stuff live free breadsticks."}
{"text":"For a chain, I have to say YUM.  Sometimes out of desperation, I admit I have to turn to Domino's and other chains but I have no problem when I have to turn to Vocelli.  

I have never had anything bad here, delivery is always prompt, and I am always getting special offers in my email box (enabling me to want to get it more).  If you want to get a solid pie with good service, Vocelli is better than your basic chain in aol ways!"}
{"text":"Pros: I'm not a fan of Vocelli's, but this franchise seems to have higher standards than others I've visited. The food is actually halfway decent for cheap delivery pizza, the staff are friendly, and they'll let you know if there's a coupon that would apply to your order, so you'll usually save more money than you expected.

Cons: The pizza is nothing special, and probably every other time I've visited there's been some mistake - missing toppings, etc. They're always happy to correct it, but it would be better if they got it right the first time."}
{"text":"Vocelli's Pizza has got to be one of the best places to eat hand's down! Eric who's Manager and Chef is just amazing! The food is excellent!.. I love this place! Listen you will not regret ordering the parmesan flavored wingdings!.. Absolutely delicious!..
PS if they get your order wrong (which is very rare) they will fix it free of charge."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place at 1:45pm, the online service told me it left the store at 2:06. 3:00 rolls around, and I call the store because I live only 0.8 miles away, it should've gotten here by now. The person who answers is rude AS SOON AS I GET ON THE PHONE. Says that I don't answer my phone, which is actually my fault. It was an old number put on my account and I didn't realize it. But this rude person said the driver knocked on my front and back door. WRONG. I was sitting RIGHT next to my door THE WHOLE TIME. NOBODY KNOCKED ON MY DOOR. Of course after I said this the person got EVEN MORE RUDE, so I did too. They told me the only thing they could do is send them back out. I don't want the cold pizza after you lied about knocking on my doors? Continued to be rude, then told me I couldn't order from there ever again. Good, after that crappy customer service, I don't want to order from there ever again. Hung up on me. I called back, asked for a refund for the pizza I wasn't getting. Told me no, I wasn't getting a refund, I wasn't getting anything from them. I had to call the customer service line and get a refund. Don't eat at this place, they obviously are very rude and don't give two craps about their customers."}
{"text":"I had pizza from here for lunch yesterday, courtesy of a friend who I helped move.  I'd also had some from the Lawrenceville location at an event I attended over a year ago, also gratis.  In both instances, I wasn't impressed by the quality or taste.  The pizza is your pretty nondescript, standard chain pizza (not thin crust, but not deep dish either), akin to pizza from national chains such as Papa John's, Domino's, etc.  I actually prefer Papa John's to Vocelli, since I like their sauce better (smoother and sweeter) and the garlic sauce that comes with the pies.  I can't comment on toppings, since both times, I had plain cheese pizza (which is my standard for judging pizza quality, anyway).  I also can't comment on the price or service, since I didn't order in either instance.  There's way better pizza to be had in PGH (see my pizza list for suggestions), so do yourself a favor and patronize a great independent pizza place--or even a decent chain pizzeria, such as Papa John's or Pizza Hut.

EDIT: In the Regent Square/Swissvale/Wilkinsburg area, I recommend Park Pizza and Cream on Braddock, which makes a far superior pizza, and also sells by the slice."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  I had a standard cheese and pepperoni pizza (although they have a wide variety of speciality options).  It was hot and fresh and the pepperoni just a little crisp, just the way I like it.  Where is fell short was the chicken fingers.  Instead of serving whole fingers gently tossed in hot sauce like I'm used to in Buffalo, they were cut up into pieces, swimming in sauce and had some sort of cayenne flavor to them.

I'll be trying Vocelli again for a different variety of pizza, but next time I'll pass on any wings or fingers."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered food from Vocellis (Greentree rd) due to horrible storms they lost power knocking out the ovens and register. Even with the set back Tony and Mike worked diligently to get the ovens up and running. I was very impressed with their level of customer care and service. Five star service from these guys and the organization!!"}
{"text":"Oh, those pepperoni rolls!!!

I've had nothing but good experiences with Vocelli since moving here this past May - in fact, this was the first place we ordered from, since it was so late by the time we got here that it was the only place open.  The online ordering system they have is slick and user-friendly, there are always coupons, and the food has always been hot and delicious on arrival. 

I'm holding back from giving it 5 stars because the only things that really wow me (and boy, do they wow me) are the pepperoni rolls and the breadsticks.  The small pizzas are a great size for two, the \"Neapolitan\" crust (kind of like a thinner, round Sicilian) is inventive and delicious, and the boneless wings are reliably good (if unimaginative).  The cheese sticks aren't really worth it, the \"chicken tenders 'taliano\" were a little greasy, and the hoagies weren't anything to write home about.  Go with the classics, and ask for extra sauce!

(The fiance weighs in: The regular wings are good, the chicken tenders 'taliano are fine, the pizza is REALLY great!, and the sandwiches and boneless wings are underwhelming.  \"And the cheese sticks, cheese bread, whatever the **** they call it, is NOT worth trying.\")"}
{"text":"This location makes good food but could also use a good cleaning. I ordered a thin crust pizza with pepperoni which is what I normally get. Most times this location under cooks the crust on their normal pizza, so I always tend to play it safe with the pre-made thin.  They also have good cookies.  If you are in the area, I recommend a thin crust pizza......and cookies."}
{"text":"Stopped by this location for a quick bite. The service was fast, the place looked clean, and the food was pretty good (Spicy Italian Stromboli and Bacon & cheese rolls). I recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered grilled chicken hoagie with no mayo and Italian dressing on the side. It gets delivered with mayo on it and no Italian dressing to be found. The pizza was horrendous.  Terrible crust and just plain tasting overall."}
{"text":"We wanted pizza for dinner last night but were looking for something a little different. While browsing local pizza shops online, I came across Vocelli's menu and noticed the Mac and cheese pizza. As soon as I told my boyfriend he said GET IT! Haha. We took advantage of the online ordering which was a bit hard to navigate but it turned out okay. 

We ordered the Mac and cheese pizza, and were surprised that we could further customize the pizza, so we did! We got buffalo sauce instead of traditional pizza sauce.  I also got a garden Della casa salad with ranch dressing and we decided to try the spinach and mushroom roll ups appetizer.

The pizza was BOMB. The Mac and cheese could for sure stand on its own, I was surprised and relieved that it was actually good mac and cheese! If you're into spice, I'd absolutely recommend subbing the buffalo sauce!! Also, the pizza was not greasy AT ALL and the crust was soft and tasted very fresh!

The garden salad was DELICIOUS, pretty, and VERY fresh. It looked just like the picture online. I requested no black olives and there were indeed no olives in the salad. The dressing was a packet of Ken's ranch, and I do prefer homemade ranch but I think Ken's is very good as well so I wasn't disappointed. They also included a package of plastic cutlery which was nice.

We both really enjoyed the spinach roll ups. They were a bit greasy but we expected that. The flavor was excellent; spinach, mushroom, cheese, and lots of garlic! I believe there were 9 roll ups in the order, along with a side of pizza sauce. 

The delivery was scheduled for 6:04 (30 minutes from our order submission) and the driver was at our door at 6:05! He was very friendly and the food was piping hot (and the salad was nice and cold). We will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"This was a delivery order for:

Pepperoni Pizza
Hot Wings

Pizza the texture and flavor of cardboard. Wings were covered in black pepper. I just do not understand why anyone would order from them other than the fact that they are open late."}
{"text":"Excellent food. They are my favorite because I can work my diet around their menu. Love their selections. Their chocolate chip cookies are the best. They are number one with me. Very courteous employees? that are always helpful. I can depend on all their food being fresh and tasty. I love their promptness. No long waits. I consider them all to be special and I claim them as my pizza store. Of course their nice Specials? are easy on the pocket book."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I ordered pizza tonight and they told me it would take 20 minutes before it was ready. 30 minutes later I called and they said they were waiting on a driver. An hour after I ordered I called again. Instead of delivering to the address less than half a mile away in Swissvale, they drove to Lincoln before realizing they don't deliver out there. I told the manager I just wanted my money back, but he offered to remake the pizza and deliver it, and refund me, which I accepted. The money has been refunded, but it's been an hour and a half since then, and I STILL haven't received my pizza. I will NEVER order from here again."}
{"text":"I feel I need to add a disclaimer. I give this a 4 star for Pittsburgh; since good pizza places lack. This is a solid pizza place. I've been ordering from year for over a year and they have never messed up an order. I give it 4 stars because it's consistent and their specials make the prices pretty good. My latest order was for my sons party; 4 one topping large pizzas for $39. Everyone at the party liked then"}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh from out of town. Menu is here in the hotel lobby, so we call and order. Menu says open till 11 and they deliver 7 days a week. Woman on the phone says they are doing pick up only \"and actually we're closing in 10 minutes (which would be 9).

Maybe update your printer menus and your online information then.

Sad, this guy who is here with his family just wasted 20 min getting orders for a place that won't oblige. See photo."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent. We ordered two pepperoni pizzas with sausage and garlic sauce along with two house baked Italian subs. One of the best in the area."}
{"text":"Not bad quick and easy!! I had a sub and was pretty good and tasty"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok, just regular old delivery pizza. However, I tried the pesto chicken pasta and it was NOT good. The chicken was dry and tasteless, the sauce was green and pesto looking, but tasted nothing like pesto, and the noodles on all sides of the container were burned. Don't waste money on their pesto chicken pasta."}
{"text":"4 stars for a chain pizza joint - you betcha ya.

I'm pretty picky about Pizza and let's face it most chains pizza is not very good. Vocelli's is different, not do they different crusts to choose from they have their gourmet pizza selection which beats all other chains hands down.

Plus they have always been fast and after getting pies from 2 different stores they have had good consistency."}
{"text":"Brought my son here today for lunch and he ordered the lunch special. It was enough food for two meals. He loved his pizza. Pizza seems like it is hand tossed and the toppings are super fresh. We enjoyed our first experience with you."}
{"text":"Best experience by this pizza shop! Thank you for the great customer service and for being able to execute a large order for us. Your team delivered to us downtown and we really appreciate that!!"}
{"text":"A great selection of food with a very friendly staff! I came here for lunch and enjoyed the meatball sub. It was very good! The only thing I would change about it would be adding more sauce. The flatbread pizzas looked really good. A co-worker and I came here for lunch when we were in town for work. They are conveniently located next to our office so we were able to just walk over. We both had subs and thought they were really good. They offer them in a 6 inch or foot long.

The food took about 10 minutes which wasn't too bad. I think it was because they had to toast the subs to melt the cheese which was well worth the wait! The lunch special was great because you could add a drink to your sub for 50 cents! A really great deal!"}
{"text":"My neighborhood go-to pizza takeout joint. Sadly, however, the quality of this place has gone a tad downhill. Today, NYD, our pizza arrived stone cold in a soggy cardboard box. And the XL size is now the size of a MED, which is bad news for two big hungry football watchin' dudes and a hung over gal (ahem, it is NYD, folks). 

Get it together, Vocelli's Swissvale. You are walking a very thin line. But, I am willing to give you another chance in 2012."}

Got delivery from the Baum location tonight 

NATIONAL PIZZA DAY

Garlic knots very nice

Bacon cheddar-knots very good

For being extremely busy on the  National Pizza Day Delivery was fast and courteous 

Best of all everything was still hot when we received it.  

Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza at 11:45 at night.  They didn't hesitate to take my order even though it was 15 minutes before closing.  They weren't able to deliver the pizza that night and they gave me a call the next day.  They delivered a cash refund, a larger pizza, breadsticks, brownies, cannoli, and cookies.  They wouldn't accept any tip.  I was not even mad to begin with.

I loved the food and now I love the service.  This vocellis is the best I've had."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from this location many times in the past 15 years. Today i traveled all day and hadn't eaten much, so my husband promised my favorires when i got home. The internet order promised 30-45 minites. Well after an hour, he called to check and they said the order was \"just about\" to leave the store. He headed out to pick up something else. I still wanted my pizza, so i called back. They put me on hold for a manager and then I got cut off. I called back. They pffered a discount on our next order (teally? who would order again?) I said I wanted the price of the order credited to our account. At this point the guy started yellong at me about how pizza places get busy and they have no control over what time the internet order promises. He said I should call someone, but i couldn't understand the name. When I asked, he screamed he was busy and hung up on me.

We had fried chicken from Giant Eagle. Will drive to any other place for pizza in the future.

Long live customer service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in today's ordering experience.  We love Vocelli Pizza and have been ordering from Moon Vocelli for years anytime we want pizza.  

When I ordered today, my experience was as good as always.  They informed me they were running behind and that it would be an hour before our pizza would arrive.  We said \"no problem\".   The weather is nice, so we sat outside on our front porch to wait for the order to arrive.  After an hour and a half, we decided to call to see if they would be here soon.

A woman rudely interrupted the person who had answered and demanded my phone number and address, and then proceed to tell me I must have given the wrong address and her driver waited for 15 minutes and no one answered the phone (well yes, that's because we were outside on the porch waiting for the delivery).  She then told me to come get my order or she could cancel it.  We opted for the cancel.

The only thing we could figure is the delivery driver must have come to our back door.  Of all the years we've been ordering from Vocelli, they have ALWAYS delivered to the front door.  Maybe delivery preference should be included with the ordering process.  I would have hoped the driver would have thought to try the front door but I guess that's asking too much of a low paid position. 

If our theory is correct, it was a simple misunderstanding, but the woman I talked to was not very pleasant and hence I became not very pleasant in response.  I get that they are busy, but is yelling at the customer the best choice?"}
{"text":"First of all, I love Vocelli. I decided to visit the store in moon township since there was a special on pick ups and I only live less than a mile away. The place was so dirty. The women didn't use gloves, no hair net. She was the only person in there. 

There was another time when my girlfriend ordered the pizza late and they said it was too late to deliver. I do understand that. But they never refunded her for the pizza! And whenever we called back the women always responded \"oh the manager isn't here\""}
{"text":"I don't get the bad reviews, they have great pizza!  I've never had a bad item from the Mt. Lebanon store. 

I just got delivery and from time they sent me a confirmation email to the time they sent an email saying my order was out for delivery was 12 minutes! Pretty impressive. 

My pizza was cooked perfectly, and they have the best sauce and pepperoni around. 

I also got a grilled chicken salad and there was one piece of wilted lettuce, but the rest of the lettuce and veggies were really fresh!   I had a pizza and salad coupon for 15.99. Not bad. 

I order here frequently because of the fast friendly delivery, but one thing I don't like is their delivery charge since it doesn't go to the driver. Seems like an attempt at grabbing every dollar they can, and I deducted a star for this charge. 

With coupons or specials, it's great pizza at a reasonable price. :)"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience with them. The food is always perfectly cooked and tastes even better. From the pizza, to the appetizers, to the desserts (mmm, cannoli!), it's all fantastic! They are my #1 choice in the area for pizza delivery!"}
{"text":"I am a fan because of the pizza and cheese sticks with sausage and marinara. The wings are good too."}
{"text":"The pizza is decent pizza, most of the time. However, everyone who works there either has no manners or is completely rude. If you're gonna get pizza in squirrel hill just take your business anywhere else because I guarantee they'll be 1000% better."}
{"text":"Horrible. I used to like their pizza a lot. Haven't had it in years though. Must have changed. I was told it would take 35 minutes and it took over an hour for delivery. Tasted like it had been sitting there for days. I've had better at a gas station. Bread sticks were sopping wet with oil it actually splattered all over the counter when I took them out of he bag. Had one piece of pizza and a breadstick and threw it all away. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I am dating a girl just up the road and we have walked in an ordered pizza to be delivered in the past the pizza is amazing and being a couple beers in I am really not sure how fast it was delivered. But I called again tonight to order in for one of those chill nights and it took 1:42 minutes to get our cold pizza. The poor delivery guy took my hurtful blows, instead of  the stoner on the phone who repeated back our information and wrote it down wrong. If you call and get the burnout just call the next company.

{"text":"The management and employees are mostly quite rude, and my business with them was not pleasant. They seemed to care very little about their customer service. The food was okay, but I've had better at other Vocelli locations."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time on Halloween night. Had delivery and they arrived right within the time frame I was given on the phone. We went with a large traditional pepperoni pizza with sausage on half of it and a side of buffalo wings. Overall it was fine, but it was nothing extraordinary or out of the box. Probably won't order it again, but that's only because I can get 3 pizzas for the same price from Sams Club that taste just as good if not better.  It's nice they offer delivery cause sometime a person just doesn't want to leave their house but otherwise it is kind of a hit for us."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza online around 7pm. I didn't get my food till two hours later. I called multiple times and they kept telling my order left. After telling me that so many times they then told me that the driver caught a flat and he would be here shortly. Well just as I was about to cancel my order ( a half hour later) the delivery guy knocks on my door. I wasn't gonna tip, but he told me that he was a different driver who was called in because they were super busy. I tipped him $8 and when I opened my box my cheese was stuck to the top of the box and cold. If it hadn't been for my hungry children they would have come back to get that shitty pizza."}
{"text":"Regardless of how good or bad their pizza is, the people working there are miserable. I had the rudest employee take my order over the phone, so much so that he was blatantly mocking me...I could practically hear his eye rolls through the phone. Sorry I made you do your job and take a two 1-topping pizza order. It's not worth the aggravation...head to any other pizza joint on that street to get vastly better pizza and service."}

{"text":"Ordered a pizza and hoagie tonight from Vocelli shaler 1019 Mt Royal Blvd , phone 412-486-8200, no response after 50 minutes on a wed night at 9 pm, called in to find out where the pizza was and was greeted by some really rude person and he said it will be there soon and started yelling at me when i said that it should not have taken that long on a wed night, he actually yelled at me on the phone!!! A customer!! I cancelled the order and will never order again from vocelli, i asked for his name and he would not answer me"}
{"text":"Vocelli Pizza has a reputation that is undeservedly negative. Perhaps it's because they are a chain, one that began life as Pizza Outlet (remember the wacky commercial with wrestler Kurt Angle?) in Mount Lebanon of all neighborhoods, and of all neighborhoods for a Vocelli Pizza to exist, Lawrenceville has one of its own. I walked there on a grey, rainy late afternoon for quick post-work nourishment prior to the Moonspell/Marduk concert at Mr. Smalls across the 40th Street Bridge, and I only went because nearby Istanbul, my original choice, appears to be closed for the time being. 

And ya know somethin'? VP doesn't make a dreadful hoagie in the least. I was told that they only serve whole hoagies (called 'House Baked Subs' on their menu), so that was dinner, and what it did was fill me up for the entire evening. The vegetables were fresh, the ciabatta-aspiring bread was freshly crisped, the cheese was gooey, the dressing was zesty, and the meat was stacked generously. It sure puts Subway's grinders in an ankle lock, preceded by an Olympic slam of course.

Stop. Snickering. 

It's real...to me. 

The hoagie that is. 

Also devoured was a pair of refridgerated cannoli with a filling that approached a sort of mascarpone or ricotta ice cream laden with chocolate chips. 

With a bellyful 'o manfuel, I stomped my way over to Millvale for a night of...

{"text":"We order from Vocelli fairly often, and I must say that for a chain, they  are quite good. 

Avoid the Steak Panini (what they call a hoagie, using the improper plural). It lowers the tone. Can you say Steakumms? Uh yeah.

Other than that misstep, I have a healthy relationship with their Italian and Meatball Panini. Their Oven-Baked Wings are tender and flavor-packed, and their pizzas taste like they came from an indy parlor; doughy crust, gooey cheese, fresh toppings. If their pizzas are frozen, they do a good job of making them taste homemade. Maybe they're made in New York and freeze-dried or something?  A fine pizza it is. No caveats."}
{"text":"Y'know, for a chain, Vocelli puts forth a perfectly fine pie. Someone ordered one from the Carrick location during our monthly Three Rivers Ferret Council meeting, and I was rightly impressed with its puffy crust, toasted bottom, lusty sauce, oily pepperoni cups, and stringy cheese. Having not had a Vocelli pizza, I was reminded of why they populate Western Pennsylvania as prolifically as they do. 

Even their Italian hoagie defeats many submarine peddlers with its baguette-like bread, zesty dressing and ample meats and vegetables. 

Hey, if left with a choice between Papa John's and Vocelli, I'm leavin' Schnatter hangin'. His riffs are nothin' but a drag, man. 

Sure, everyone favors the indie pizzerias, but for a company (founded by a Turk no less) with 100 restaurants traversing 9 states, they do their best to make it seem mom-n-pop. 

P.S. Vocelli Pizza began in the suburb of Mount Lebanon as Pizza Outlet. WWE and TNA superstar (and 'Burgh native) Kurt Angle appeared in this goofy commercial for the chain back in the late 90's...

{"text":"Vocelli's is one of my fave stops when I visit my sis in Moon. We ordered the garlic spinaci, a tasty mix of garlic,spinach and cheeses. The Vocelli crust is a thing of beauty, chewy where it needs to be, crunchy around the edges.

Service is very consistent here, our pizza arrived in about 35 minutes. The driver mentioned that occasionally the store doesn't get the online orders right away, or it would have been here sooner. 

Knowing this we might call next time, versus using the online ordering system. Still a reasonable amount of time to wait for an excellent pie."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. The food is average. Just as average as any other pizza place around. But Vocelli cancelled our order because they don't deliver to certain places (not even a half mile from their store) after certain times. 

They didn't have the decency to call me and ask if I'd pick it up, they lied and said they didn't have a delivery driver, which they DO, so they wouldn't have to drive to the hill district. Classy."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza for a chain.  Better then many of the local shops.

Came home from the PSO and had the left overs.  Pizza has a traditional crust that is not thin and the sauce is pretty good.  Had the wings for the first time and they are spicier than most places and on par with most others wings.

The bread stixs are great!  Glazed with a seasoned garlic sauce with Romano cheese and come with Vocelli dipping sauce.  YUM!"}
{"text":"In our search for good pizza we decided to try Vocelli despite having only 1 good review.  Sadly the staff left us never going back.  We ordered a medium Hawaiian pizza.  When we got it home it was a tiny plain cheese pizza.  We called to let them know.  John the manager was immediately angry and argumentative.  He seemed more than happy to not have us as customers. Don't bother, why patronize a place that treats their customers with such distain on their first order."}
{"text":"One of the scariest interactions I've ever had.

     I actually made an account on Yelp just so someone might avoid my same experience. Cashier said, \"actually, this is McDonalds\" and hung up, swore, used different voices and pretended they were different people, lied about the progress of our order, and called from a number I didn't recognize to ask for inappropriate personal information. 

     My friends and I were hungry very late (12:00-1:00 am) on a weekend. The cashier started by pretending we had called a Mcdonalds and hung up. We assumed that we had called the wrong number, but when we re-dialed Vocelli's number (correctly), it was the same person. When we asked if this really was Vocelli's, he said, \"sure\" and proceeded to take our order.

      He made a couple of lighthearted jokes at our expense (no big deal), but things turned strange when he stalled on telling us our total by pretending the \"phone cut out\" 12-14 times and used several different squeaky or nasal voices, pretending they were different people. He was dismissive, rude, and even a little scary. The call lasted twelve minutes.

     Things turned really unsettling when he even called us back several minutes later from a number we didn't recognize and asked for personal information, citing a \"screwed-up delivery\" in several different cartoon voices, all while becoming increasingly angry. At this point, we were so alarmed that we just hung up and ordered Domino's.

Although we were charged for the Vocelli's pizza, it never came.

Please avoid."}
{"text":"This was 5 star pizza! We ordered a lot because of the BOGO Wednesday deal and were not disappointed! Everyone seemed very polite and we'd come again!"}
{"text":"My company orders from Vocelli's almost on a weekly basis so I have had an assortment of their items. None of them impressed me. The pizza, breadsticks, wings and rolls are so dry and hard. I recently tried their cheesy sticks and subs and they are the worst. This is consistently what all their food is like. The salad is tiny and boring and their prices are a lot higher than you would expect for this poor quality. The ordering process and the convenient location are great but for bad, dried-out, food, I could easily go to any other pizza place."}
{"text":"So called manager was very rude. I was hung up on multiple times. I wouldn't order from here based on the poor leadership that these employees are under. Who knows what is happening near there pizza?"}
{"text":"Public Service Announcement: 
DO NOT order from Vocellis Pizza on Baum Blvd in Oakland. My order took over an hour and the cashier said \"we are too fu*cking busy to be waiting on your faggot asses.\" I asked him for his name to report it, and he said it was Deshawn. He then repeatly yelled \"get yo faggot ass out my fucking store\"....

Yup... its 2017 and that just happened.... so I snapped his picture  (public shame time bitch )"}
{"text":"Picked up a \"well done\" pepperoni, mushroom and green pepper, was done to perfection! The girl on the phone was helpful selecting a coupon and the staff inside were nice as well. Would pickup again for sure."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst pizza I've ever had.  Other locations were always ok with really good salads and decent pizza for the type of chain it is. Not the case here. Pizza was over cooked making the crust look like the color of a desert landscape. Beige, dry, hard to eat and tasteless. The sauce didn't even have the Vocelli recipe flavor. Waited over and hour to have wretched food delivered under half mile away. My stomach was upset for hours after eating it."}
{"text":"Similar to a previous reviewer, I too just had a terrible experience ordering my pizza. After a litany of questions in which the man was trying to ascertain if I was in the delivery area, I cut in saying... you have my address in your system, since you just repeated it to me ... I order here often ... you have my credit card on file, etc. After a pause the man sneered back into the phone \"yea, well I don't know none of that. I don't think you're in the delivery area.\"

Yea, well, pizza is unhealthy and a treat for my kids on occasion. I guess It wasn't my lucky day?

If you are inclined to argue your way past horrible manners, grammar and attitude you might be lucky enough to be afforded an opportunity to order. I am no longer inclined.

PS... Phone call left me so angry that I wrote this review, my first."}
{"text":"Walked in at 4:30 to order a medium pizza to be picked up 30 minutes later. Paid, left, came back 30 minutes later and...... NO PIZZA!
There was a shift change within the 30 minutes I had been gone and whoever took and lost my order left. The poor guys that just started their shift had no clue what was going on and scrambled to fulfill my order. They were apologetic and threw in free breadsticks. Not sure about quality and taste of food... still sitting here waiting.....
So much for trying to save some time."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here today. Overall it was a pleasant experience.  I called to ask about their restaurant.com deal.  You can only use that for carry out but he was nice enough to give me a coupon code, $3.99 (coupon code 400) off a large one topping pizza for delivery.  I ordered half sausage half spinach.  The toppings were fresh, dough was nice and soft, and delivered quickly!  It was delicious.  Nice change from the other pizza delivery options around here! 

They have a restaurant.com deal going on right for $10 for $4 or $25 for $10 only for carry out!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the Vocelli's chain in general. They make mass-produced, cheap pizza. I suppose it's acceptable if you're planning a large party for starving people.

This review is based on a specific order. Some of my lovely coworkers ordered boneless hot and boneless garlic wings for lunch.

See my uploaded picture of what they received. 

That's right. Breaded chicken breast (cut in halves) with some red-hot dumped on top. Talk about lazy! Moreover, the garlic boneless \"wings\" tasted like chicken-flavored salt. Really gross. 

There are many other reasonably priced Italian pizza places that I would rather patronize."}
{"text":"Planned to sit down and eat dinner before going to the symphony.  Was disappointed that it was take out only.  Ate in the car.  Generous portions in our calzone which was reasonably priced.  Had to spend $20 with my restaurant.com gift certificate.  Ordered a dozen choc. chip cookies to fill the void  Did not reach $20 but he allowed me to slide.  I appreciiated that  NO RESTROOMS"}
{"text":"I have had issues in the past where they messed up my delivery order, however time passed and tonight my family and I gave them another shot.  Again mixed it up.  Didn't apologize nor did they attempt to make it right.  I called to let them know hoping they would correct it and the kid on the phone hung up on me.  Lost me as a customer and all my family members.  Terrible."}
{"text":"I expected this pizza to taste a lot better than it did for how much I paid for it.  I really think papa john's would have been better (and cheaper!)  Two factors elevate it from 2 stars to 3:

1) I love any pizza place that lets me put feta on my pizza and
2) the delivery was ridiculously fast for a friday night."}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering WINGS.  They were so small I swear they are killing baby chicks 24 hours after they hatch.  Seriously, these were the SMALLEST wings I have ever seen.  A dozen took up an area of about 5\" diameter in the box.  I estimate each wing to be approximately 1.5\" - 2\" long and no wider than a nickel to a quarter around.  I am not even kidding...I wish I had pictures.  They were good but MICROSCOPIC.  The pizza from here is always good so that is why they got 2 stars.  Otherwise, this would be a 1 star review."}
