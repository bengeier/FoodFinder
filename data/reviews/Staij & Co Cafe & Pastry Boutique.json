{"text":"Staij & Co is my go-to place for cakes and pastries. Anastasia has an amazing talent creating beautiful cakes that not only look incredibly beautiful but taste extremely GOOD!!!  I am never disappointed with anything I have ever gotten from here, will continue to return as well as recommend to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"A cozy coffee shop tucked away on Parliament street. We stepped in for a delicious cafe mocha and some tea. They had an array of tempting cupcakes that caught our eye but we resisted them since we were on a diet. The server was extremely pleasant and we had a wonderful expereince."}
{"text":"New spot. Sister and brother own this place. Took the place of the Cabbagetown bistro. Hopefully this place will survive. Cupcakes and some baked goods. Coffee was great, perhaps could be a bit stronger. I think they will have to offer a bit more (sandwiches ,soups etc) to survive"}
{"text":"A really cute and elegant coffee shop in cabbage town, just what the block needed. The owner makes all the baked goods herself and they are phenomenal! Delicious to eat and lovely to look at. If you're into macaroons you're gonna love this spot. Anastasia also does custom orders if you're looking to spruce up any event or occasion. She's especially good with cakes.   The coffee and tea here is amazing too, and what great customer service. It's the perfect spot to go chat with a friend or get some work done, it's quiet and relaxing yet the bright whites keep the store vibrant and lively - especially on a rainy summer day.   Highly recommend this place for the quality of the product and the atmosphere Staij & Co. provides."}
{"text":"Immaculate space. The selection for food and drinks are limited - but I believe they do custom wedding catering on the side so this may just be a storefront to advertise for that?  Drinks are great but standard - coffees, iced drinks, teas, etc. Their pastries look stunning and creative - including gourmet marshmallows and specialty macaroons.  Lovely experience every time"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to win a Pecan pie from a Staij&Co contest on their Instagram page just in time to celebrate Thanksgiving. Our first reaction was how BIG the pie was. We were expecting a regular sized pie that you would pick up at the grocery store but what we received was HUGE! The pie was so moist and did not have an overpowering of sweetness that Pecan Pies can have. For all of you who hate how hard pie crusts can be..you will LOVE this pie crust, it was soft and delicious and melted in your mouth. This pie blew our expectstions for every other Pecan Pie and I already want to put in my order for next year. I don't know how much these pies go for here but no matter the price it is WORTH IT!!   Aside from this pie, if you want cupcakes, croissants, lattes..take a stroll to Cabbagetown and have a visit. This place is cute, yet elegant and has a welcoming feeling too it.   If you do not follow Staij & Co on Instagram or Facebook I suggest you do! You may just be a lucky winner too :)  Thank you Staij & Co."}
{"text":"Excellent flat white. I'm off the desserts, I will say the cupcakes look very good, plus the place smells nice!"}
{"text":"This cute little cafe must've been decorated by a minimalist: featuring all white everything, a clear glass chandelier and tiny gold utensils.  Stopped in on a quiet Sunday morning to warm up and tried their weekend special: a hot cup of cocoa with a huge Nutella marshmallow for $3.50. It was decadent and there was some Nutella at the end that didn't mix into the drink.  Did the trick and warmed me up! Will have to come back to try their homemade croissants."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. The coffee is beautiful  and their pastries are to die for. I have macaroons every time I come because they're so delicious. The decoration is lovely and the staff are always friendly. There's free wifi and I've never had trouble getting a seat. This place is a find."}
{"text":"Would have never stopped by this place was it not for their street sign. The interior of this shop is clean, elegant and screams luxurious. Prices for the cupcakes were fair but was slightly disappointed with the limited selection of just 4 different flavours of cupcakes to try. All the cupcakes looked tempting so I topped for 1 of each. Decided to have them boxed up and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the box appeared. Frosting had a hard exterior but smooth and velvety texture on the inside upon biting. Cake portion was moist. Overall a great asset to Cabbagetown."}
{"text":"This place looked promising based on the reviews and how cute it looked from the outside. They have a nice patio out front and inside is spacious as well. They had cupcakes & macarons, cookies... I just got a salted caramel cupcake. It was so stale. Absolutely awful... They charge higher end prices yet serve cupcakes hard as rock? I ate a bit of stale icing and gave the rest to my boyfriend who has no tastebuds. He didn't even finish it either."}
{"text":"I've been ordering my cakes from Staij & Co for years now.  Although the cafe is new, Anastasia is definitely not new to her craft.  Cakes are always, fresh, delicious and absolutely stunning.  Can't recommend her enough."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich I have ever had hands down.  There is a clear commitment to quality ingrediants here.  Staff and decor amazing as well.  I also found out they do the most amazing cakes as well. This is a must visit gem in toronto."}
