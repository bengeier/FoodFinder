{"text":"Sushi Q was suggested to me by a regular customer. She and I share similar tastes in food and would often see each other at our neighborhood sushi favorite, Hana. Always up for a new food experience, I went to Sushi Q with my partner tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  It's one of those unassuming, stuck-in-a-strip-mall-in-an-odd-part-of-town places -- tucked away between a liquor store and baskin-robbins on 19th avenue, just south of dunlap. Inside is a somewhat typical looking sushi place, a little dated but with a nice enough wooden sushi bar and some cute japanese accents (geisha prints, sake bottles, row of cute fortune cat figures.)  My partner had already arrived and was enjoying a couple items off the all-you-can-eat menu, so I decided to join him. I'm not much of an all-you-can eat person, but somehow it seems OK here - and a decent bargain at $25 per person. I'm happy to say that it was a smart decision as everything we had was really good to delicious. Not to mention a great way to sample items on the sushi menu. (AYCE menu is a bit more limited than regular sushi menu, but still offers a good variety of items)  You'll find most of the usual suspects on the AYCE sushi menu, plus a variety of specialty rolls. Salmon and albacore nigiri, spicy tuna handroll and agadashi tofu were all very good (though agadashi was really just tempura tofu with dipping sauce). Red Snapper nigiri was outstanding -  fresh light fish with a citrus ponzu, green onion and bit of sriracha for just the right kick. Also really enjoyed the Hot Night roll - spicy tuna, crab and avocado deep fried and topped with spicy mayo, sriracha and sesame seeds - yum! what's not to like about that?  There's also a small but decent selection of sake and beer here, and prices are very reasonable compared to other sushi spots in town. Our server and sushi chef were very nice and helpful, and I have a feeling that the more we come back, the more we'll feel like family. And I can tell you now, we'll be back many times..."}
{"text":"Love to get the 37 pc platter for 3 that sells for $30. Have to get my wakame salad as a side. Like their version of sushi pizza too. Very good quality for a great price!"}
{"text":"This place is just starting to come back.  When it opened, Jay was the owner and it was fabulous.  He sold the business and left back to Korea and the quality slipped, a TV was put in on the wall and the food started to stink, literally.  Soon after the health department had a big problem with their cleanliness.  We quit going for almost a year then stopped in and found a new Japanese sushi chef in charge.  The TV was now TWO TV's but the food was very good.  They still have the all you can eat sushi for $22.95 but we've never tried that.  We always order off the menu and its been very good as of late.  Try the churashi sushi for a change...tea is very good, miso soup is average, sake selection is the usual hakatsuru which is fine with me.  Haven't seen the crazy milk (sake) there lately but it was a favorite.  Not many selections beyond the basic fish.  The new chef does make a smashing quail egg however."}
{"text":"Horrible service ....he put way to much rice in the rolls and no fish what so ever ....I don't  recommend  this place for anyone"}
{"text":"Love this spot the sushi is always fresh n the prices r good. I really recommend this place for the sushi lovers."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and affordable. I tried the gyoza, several rolls and nigiri and all were great. Don't judge this place by the outside. Inside it is very nice and the chef and waitress were wonderful. Will definitely be back many more times."}
{"text":"Decent basic sushi and sashimi.  To me, sashimi is the best measuring stick.  If the raw fish isn't good, well then why eat there.  of the sashimi combo, the salmon, hamachi, and tataki were all very good.  The ahi was OK - it tasted fresh and had a decent texture (I hate mealy ahi) but the flavor was just ok.  The mucho salmon role was very tasty, though with a bit more sauce than I prefer (an easy fix).  The seaweed salad was tasty, though not a big variety of seaweed, mostly just the bright green grass-like type.  The hot tea was excellent, and served in a  big pot. Will I go there again?  Heck yes, for a quick, healthy, relatively inexpensive meal.  Will I go there when I'm craving fabulous fish or creative dishes?  Not the place for that.  I must admit I haven't been here for a year or so because I'd been very unhappy with the food since the original owner sold the place.  The previous time I visited the smell of bleach seared my nostrils and I thought \"what the..???\"  I spied in the back room that they were bleaching the table linens, spraying beach from a bottle.  Peee-ew.  Happily this is no longer the practice and the food was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Plat de sushi à peine avalé et je m'empresse de partager notre commentaire : excellent service, aimable et rapide, excellent rapport qualité/prix avec de bonnes portions de poisson pour vraiment pas cher : ex. Le combo du chef pour 2 personnes à 20$ !  Incontournable dans le quartier."}
{"text":"I am disappointed. The nigiri is not fresh at all. The salmon and tuna actually smells a little stinky. Maybe this does not happen everyday, but the fact that this could even happen tells a lot. This is scary because all the fish meat is actually served raw. If you definitely want to go for it, use a lot of wasabi to cover the flavor up, so you won't risk feeling anything that isn't fresh.   Another fine detail: there is toooo much water in the miso soup. This is minor, but imagine doing cost control with miso soup!   This will be my last time here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were shopping at the Phoenix Metrocenter mall, when he was in the mood for sushi, so we went here. Never been here before, but MAN was the sushi good! I got the Las Vegas rolls and the bo got the Tokyo. Friendly service, reasonable prices, and the best sushi around!"}
{"text":"Went there last Friday, had the ACYE, and to tell the truth it was just OK. They cautioned me at the start that I should tell them when I was getting full, made two rolls at a time, and each was, well, just OK. The standout was the Alaska roll, with beautifully marinated salmon and a spicy crab mix inside. The rest was rather blah, and I walked away about $30 lighter with tip and still craving good sushi. I'll try them again but if the next experience is like the first that's it for them."}
{"text":"Yessss ! Found a new favorite sushi place.   This sushi counter has everything I like. Simple, traditional sushis made with good quality ingredients. They don't skimp on the fish either.  They also have original offerings like a ''deconstructed sushis'' complete with rice, fish (4 kinds), spicy tempura, gourd, wakame and other salads.  The very best part is their prices.  The quality is similar and often higher then what one would get at the more trendy sushi restaurants for about half the price. A fancy sit down restaurant it is not. It's more of a take out place.  It's in the Wilderton shopping center, close to the Metro store. There are 4 or 5 small tables and a few seats at the counter if you want to eat there. They also offer ''party platters'' for about 8-10$ per person. You can't beat that.  They are always busy but the 5 or 6 people behind the counter keep it rolling at a good pace. They have been there for 6 or 7 years.  I'm sad I only learnt about their existence now."}
{"text":"Not sure why another poster said the all you can eat sushi is gone, we were just in here 2 weeks ago 5/2/2014, and got some all you can eat sushi!  Let me tell you, no problem getting 100% STUFFED from all you can eat sushi.  Love this place, it looks like a hole in the wall but is very nice on the inside, NOT what you would expect at all from the outside view.  The sushi is grade A, great quality, and is on par with some of the more expensive sushi restaurants around the valley.  Now granted, I've only been here 3 times, but I will be back MANY MORE.  This place is dangerously close to one of my offices...  There will be many more trips to sushi q for office meetings in the near future...."}
{"text":"I wasnt gonna do this review because I dont really like to do negative reviews, but that's what Yelp is all about.     I went to Sushi Q for lunch the day before I left Phoenix. A small place on the side of a strip mall. When we first walked in I noticed the place had a smell.  \"Ooooh that smell, can't you smell that smell, Ooooh that smell\" not a good smell, a smell that's like someone hurled last week and no one cleaned it up. Or like the carpet smells at some dive bars or low end strip bars have. I never did get pass it the whole time I was there. The server was kinda not nice. You know when they make you feel like they don't care if you eat there or not.  Like your inconveniencing them. That's the feeling I got from her.  Ok to the food. They have \"all you can eat\" for like $23.95 per person. It was 3 of us, and I can't eat seafood, so that was not for me. After looking it over, the \"happy hour\" menu was the best deal. I had the teriyaki chicken bowl with rice, and vegetable tempura. The tempura was flavorful, but the teri chicken was just ok, at best. My daughter and son in law had about 7 or 8 different rolls, and according to them, they were ok.  I can't see myself giving more than a 3 for the food, but when I add that \"smell\" the place had, it quickly drops to a 1. Sushi Q really need to spend some cash and replace that carpet, because just cleaning it won't cut it.  FOR REAL!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi.  I'm not the most adventurous - I always stick to regular California rolls.  But they are fresh, and the place seems clean and orderly.    My husband usually gets a variety of different things and is always content too.  They often throw in a free miso soup too - I think it's free with some meals, but I've never figured out what it is that we buy that gets us the soup.  But it's an enjoyable bonus!  Good option for lunch in the PATH."}
{"text":"Not too many sushi places in the financial district food courts compared to burgers, subs etc.... and I was surprised by the quality of this little place.  I've been here a few times for lunch, had salmon sashimi, avocado rolls, shrimp tempura rolls and a fuji (?) maki/sushi mixed box - all good.  The sashimi is not on the menu but you can order it - they'll prepare it on the spot.  Friendly staff.  Fair prices.  Very limited seating, but the huge food court seating area is steps away."}
{"text":"Ordered from the AYCE menu and some of the salmon did not taste fresh. Any roll that had cream cheese was over filled with it. I know great sushi and this place was sub par. Maybe the smelly carpet and dive bar like atmosphere dampened my review. **Any suggestions as to where to get ayce sushi in the phoenix and outer phoenix areas would be great!** thank you"}
{"text":"The all you can eat sushi is not really all you can eat!!!  My friends and I went there for dinner one night and we all got the all you can eat deal.  Once we saw the menu we realized there were all kinds of rules on the quantity of special rolls and sashimi you can order per person. If you like to pay $25 for unlimited California rolls,  this is the place for you. In addition,  the quality of their sushi was mediocre. Don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I'd definitely recommend this place as their sushi is always fresh.  Their prices aren't necessarily the best, however I'm always up for some late afternoon sushi over there as I've never had a bad experience with their sushi over there. For a small sushi location, they do quite well. Especially considering they give you the option of a miso soup for no extra charge when purchasing sushi over there.  I'm also not a fan of how they have some items at the door with no prices on them (such as extremely over-priced wasabi peas).  All-in-all however, I've been going to this place rather regularly and I've yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Extensive sushi choices with great portions and very reasonable prices. The quality and freshness of the food is...acceptable, but let's not complain here - there's clearly way worse. In any case the taste is quite agreeable, everything looks visually appealing, and the sizeable cuts of fish and excellent filling to rice ratios were a pleasant surprise. All containers also come with miso soup. :)  Service is unfortunately not the best in my personal experience. I've never been greeted coming into this store, although the lady at the counter has apparently taken to staring at me expressionlessly while I browse through the selection every time. Nevertheless, this is a grab and go kind of place, and I'm usually too busy thinking about fulfilling my sushi craving anyway to care."}
{"text":"I used to work nearby, and after a 2 year hiatus, returned for dinner.  It's a small strip mall joint, with wood decor and accents, with a bar running nearly the full length of the place.  My usual bento box lunch wasn't on the dinner menu, so I opted to order a la carte.  I started with a bowl of Miso, it's always nice and flavorful here, not watered down, and worked wonders on my sore throat!  I'll have to remember that the next time I'm sick!  We also started with Spicy Calamari.  The calamari is served in bite-sized squares, lightly fried and served with spicy mayo.  It was a nice departure from your everyday deep-fried calamari appetizer plate.  As for their sushi, I LOVE their Tootsie roll, it's so crunchy and sweet, and is a must try.  I'm also a fan of their Shrimp Killer and Spicy Tuna rolls. This time I got the Tootsie roll and the Lighting roll.  The Tootsie was fantastic as always, but I wasn't a huge fan of the Lighting roll, I'm not sure if I just didn't like the flavor combination, but it tasted too oniony.  Service is decent, although I remember our servers being more attentive during lunch hours.  Still, no complaints.  All in all, if you're craving sushi, it makes a great lunch spot, and it made for a good cheap dinner with friends.  There are better sushi places out there, but Sushi Q is worth a stop if you're in the area and in the mood."}
{"text":"Sushi Q is a sushi lunch takeout place in Commerce Court.  The staff are super friendly and always welcome me when I arrive (they must recognize me due to my weekly visits).  The food is fresh and they will custom make you an item if it is not in the cold case.  As I said I eat here at least once per week.  The prices are not the cheapest for takeout (I think I could have the same meal at a sit-down place for the same price) but the fact you get soup, it is ultra-quick and the food is tasty and fresh makes it a good lunch option for those who work in the financial district."}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Q many times when I was attending DeVry University, Tried almost every roll available at the time and they were all pretty good and decent sized for the price. I've taken my family out to try this place out and they loved it just disliked that it's far from where we live - then again everywhere is kinda far for us lol.  The shop is on the small side but it fits the place for what it is and I'm not complaining - interior atmosphere is very quiet and relaxing, the decor is nice as well and the sushi chef and waiters are very nice and you could carry on an actual conversation as to other places who kind of just answer \"yes/no\" and walk away all anti-social.   If you want to go on a sushi date, this is the place to be if you want a small nice and quiet relaxing spot to take that special someone too if you don't desire flashy bigger noisy places."}
{"text":"Decent place for a good quick grad and go. There is a million of these places along the path all pretty much selling the identical thing.  I wonder if they all get their product from the same bulk vendor.   I the usual, dragon roll with some sort of sriracha mayo sauce spread decoratively across the top.   Good for what it is hut definitely not fine dinning"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have been here enough that they know me by name. What I like here are several things. First, the AYCE sushi is a great deal if you can eat a lot. They will accommodate you if you want it made a certain way (for example no sesame seeds, no ponzu sauce, or extra cucumbers). The staff is very friendly and attentive. The owner Eddie, is a Korean who makes Japanese food and speaks to me in Spanish. Right on! The place is no frills but quaint and cozy like a neighborhood joint where everybody knows you. The albacore tuna is made with a real tasty garlic sauce and they have several good rolls. One of my favorites is the Alaskan-crab mix inside, salmon outside. The miso soup is pretty standard if you like it. I dont care much for tofu, it's kinda like soybean poop.  This is the type of place that when your a regular, they really go out of their way to please you. It is amazing the night and day difference between sushi made to order at the bar and any other pre made stuff anywhere. Sunnyslope is not where I would imagine a great sushi hang out, but it's here!"}
{"text":"I like fish. Raw, fresh fish. When I saw a sushi joint a minute away from the office I had to give it a shot.   Sushi Q is an unassuming restaurant located in a strip mall. I was pleasantly surprised by the interior. It was clean and nicely decorated.   Eager to eat I took a seat at the sushi bar. I ordered Yellow tail, salmon, a Vegas roll and some Miso soup.   The soup was exactly as it should be, nice and salty with chunks of tofu. Terrific on a balmy Arizona day!   The sushi, sadly, wasn't completely up to par. The yellow tail had an odd, overly firm texture to it, whereas the salmon was sort of falling apart. The taste was OK but the texture killed it for me.   I have a pet peeve when it comes to rolls. The pieces need to be bite sized! The Vegas roll was cut into gigantic, wheel sized pieces that took two to three bites each.   I'd be willing to try Sushi Q again, mostly due to the proximity to work. Not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"I've frequented Sushi Q quite a bit when I am near that part of town.  The restaurant is located in a nondescript shopping center and the interior is not something you would write home about.  However, if you are all about the sushi, then this place is for you.  Not some place where I would take your significant other on a date but definitely take your crew to just enjoy fresh sushi.  The all-you-can-eat pricing provides great value if you can eat like Orca!  The nigiri is solid and the Eel Tempura Roll is fantastic.  I'm not a huge sushi roll fan but every one that I have tried was good.  As I mentioned the decor is not great.  The sushi chef is a big fan of golf and will always have the Golf Channel on the 1 TV in the restaurant.  Overall, a great place to go if you are really hungry for quality sushi."}
{"text":"Service is efficient and the quality /price ratio is the best I know of in Montreal when it comes to sushi. The chef platters are a great deal if you're having a casual get together.  I love their sashimi lunch special."}
{"text":"This unassuming treasure of the culinary world is hidden in the most unlikely of places: a strip mall at 19th and Dunlap! Nestled among the shops that surround what was once a Fry's Food Store, only a mile and a half from Metrocenter, this house of fresh rolls is worth the adventure.  As you step in, not knowing what you might see at this crossing, you are instantly immersed in the atmosphere of an authentic, sushi house. The inside feels as foreign to it's exterior surroundings as sushi is to a desert metropolis. Plus; they've been doing what they're obviously good at for 10 years!  The food is simply fantastic, and the best part? All you can eat sushi for $24! The miso soup at the end of the night could use a little love, but otherwise the food is exactly what you expect from a $$ or $$$ sushi house. The fish is kept fresh; the presentation is spot-on, and the young, Korean chef has been serving up raw realness for 20 years across the U.S and the world!  This isn't your hole-in-the-wall dive sushi shack; this is the sushi in the Central West Valley you bring your friends and family to! Kan Pai! Barioishii!"}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying the waitress and sushi chef were amazing. I think my water was filled to the top like 5 times. The scallop nigiri was great. That's where the greatness ends. The sushi almost tasted gas station/grocery store quality. I've tried the top 5 or so rated places in Phoenix and this wasn't remotely close in taste. I'm not sure if it was the texture of their rice or what but something was off. Despite some of the best service I've had I won't be back. Had high hopes :-("}
{"text":"I love this place!  Its a hole in the wall and you wouldn't even know it was here without YELP.   If youre in the neighborhood show this place some love!!!!  It tastes better than the Scottsdale joints I PROMISE"}
{"text":"Awesome deals & Good food !! I highly recommend it !  The place is a hole in the wall but they have a really good happy hour !"}
{"text":"Beware - Food Baby On Board! Why do I take an All You Can Eat menu as a personal challenge?  I went yesterday with 2 friends for late lunch/early dinner.  We had planned on Ichi Ban at Central and Thomas for the proximity to our houses, but they didn't open till 5.  They'd been to Sushi Q before, and suggested it.  They did not tell me about the AYCE menu!  $25.95  with a decent selection of apps, nigiri and rolls.    I wasn't doing to do it.  I was going to order from the regular menu.  I chose 3 rolls (soft shell crab, tootsie and I don't remember the third) - when I figured the price, I realized I was just a couple bucks shy of the AYCE price.  So, if I ordered just one more item, it would be more cost effective to go the AYCE route. What was I thinking?  Three rolls is PLENTY!  Ordered - soft shell crab, tootsie and summer (spicy crab roll with spicy tuna on top) to start - with the plan of doing a round 2. Ate - all of mine, plus helped one of my companions finish her summer roll.  It was TOO MUCH FOOD!  For my appetite, the AYCE is a waste of money.  I should have done a miso soup and two rolls - that would have been perfect for me.  Dining companion M should have also ordered from the regular menu.  We would have been fine if we didn't have to help her.  Dining companion D made the AYCE well worth it - he was the only one it ended up making sense for.  All rolls were fresh and tasty.  D cannot have any seeds, the sushi chef was happy to make adjustments accordingly.  Oh, and M hates avocado - he was also happy to oblige her.  Good to know they will make substitutions, even on an AYCE menu!    The lady next to me had a seaweed salad that looked awesome and very fresh - and her salmon sashimi was gorgeous!  Clean place, friendly staff, fair prices.  I love strip mall sushi!  Places like this, you know you're paying for the food - not the address and state of the art decor.  (Why I don't go to the \"pretty\" places much - I'd rather spend my cash on the food than the \"see and be seen\" factor!)  It wasn't the most amazing sushi in town, but there was nothing wrong with it, and I will gladly be back!"}
{"text":"I will admit that strip mall sushi always scares me. But this place is definately worth giving a shot. This was my first time and wasnt really hungry but will definately come back. As far as the sushi goes it was good as far as my two rolls went. I had a salmon roll and a shrimp tempura roll. Man! they were fresh, tasty and just plain delicious. Kabuki has nothing on this place and for the prices its well worth it. It was $8.25 for the two rolls.  It was 5pm and there was about 5 people. Seems like this is not a busy place but hopefully i could make it my go to place from now on for sushi. If you like the small relaxing atmosphere with out the pop, hip hop or techno music really come here. Happy hour food is super cheap."}
{"text":"Okay sushi, okay price It's 3:30 and I'm craving for sushi. Here comes Sushi Q and I see from the side windows the sushi masters working hard at prepping the rolls. I was also drawn to this store by the nice greeting from the lady at the counter (not sure if she's the owner). I picked the $7.95 dynamite roll which had shrimp tempura and cucumber mixed in with green onions and soy sauce. The rice tasted old as it was hard to chew. There were 5 large pieces in the container, with your typical commercialized red ginger, wasabi and Kikkoman soy sauce. Btw they charge $0.10 for extra wasabi and ginger. At the checkout, the lady asked me if I wanted miso soup, which comes as part of the \"combo\". Not sure what the combo reference is aside from the miso soup and my 5 pieces sushi. I guess maybe some ppl opt out of the soup and that makes the purchase less of a combo? At least I wasn't charged extra, bc the total came to $8something, which sounds abt right from the $7.95 pretax. Soup was okay, typical of most other food court miso soup, no extra little pieces of tofu in soup either. For the quality of sushi that I got, I really should have been charged with EOD pricing...Tip for future, ask them to make sushi on spot for fresher ingredients!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and have always really enjoyed myself! The fish is good and is on bar with the overpriced places in Scottsdale without the price tag. I was a little wary of the All-You-Can-Eat, but its a fair deal if you can eat a lot of sushi. I found the best trick is to order in rounds otherwise your eyes can be bigger than your stomach"}
{"text":"Just one thing: best sushi in town! I have tried several of them this summer and I can tell you it is very very good and tasty!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of small locally owned businesses. The server was a bit indifferent but the sushi is good here.  Tempura and Teriyaki chicken are decent and tasty. The Hawaiian roll was excellent.  The all-you-can-eat($23.99) is a good deal, not commonly found in North or Central Phoenix and also includes non-sushi offerings. Quaint establishment but not often busy.  Hopefully things will pick up once the light rail construction is completed."}
{"text":"My favorite was the Lobster Roll using the all-you-can-eat option! Can't wait to go again and have the best sushi in the valley!"}
{"text":"I was at work and was craving sushi, so I went on the Yelp Mobile App and found that Sushi Q was right near work so I thought I would go and check it out.  Just a note, this place closes for lunch around 2 and the re-opens again for the dinner crowd.  I walked in and was the only one there.  I intended to go and sit and read my book and just relax during lunch but I went around 115 and felt like I would be rushed if I took my time so I ordered 2 sushi rolls and they came pretty fast.  The sushi wasnt bad but wasnt the best I have had either.  I had the spicy tuna roll and the flavor was just blah!  I would go there again because they have happy hour prices for lunch, score, and in a pinch, it isnt a bad place!"}
{"text":"All You Can Eat Is BACK!  $28, which is a bargain for what you get.  Three dozen rolls, at least a dozen types of fish, and various other things.    Come hungry!  It's a terrific value if you are even moderately hungry.    Waitress is top notch, chef/owner could be a bit friendlier but that's okay, and cute little indoor ambiance.   Don't let strip mall or construction scare you away, plenty of parking and it's very nice inside.  Best all you can eat sushi option in Phoenix.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"What an interesting atmosphere! Great food and cool environment. I've never had Japanese beer before. Surprisingly, it was malt liquor. Party! Be aware of the construction on nineteenth avenue and expect some delays as a result."}
{"text":"I think they're starting to remember me.  Yellow tail - Yummy! I'm gonna get this again.  Eel Tempura roll $8.95 - This comes warm & covered in crispy tempura. It was really good. Think this 1 was cut into 4 or 5 pieces.  Rock n' Roll roll $9.95 - This has shrimp tempura in it & it's really good. It was cut into 5 pieces.  Dragon roll $9.95 - Great, like always. They usually cut it up into 8 pieces."}
{"text":"Okay, it was a close Sushi place and I was in the mood for Sushi. So what the heck, the reviews were so-so and I thought I would give it a try. I debated for way to long on weather to just order rolls or do the AYCE method. I decided that I could just eat a couple of rolls and be happy so I ordered a couple of everyday rolls. A California Hand-roll, Philadelphia Roll and a Tootsie Roll. The Tootsie Roll was far sweeter than any Tootsie Roll I've had in the past, in fact too sweet, I think it set the stage for the rest.   The California Hand-roll was pretty good, it's pretty basic and easy enough, and it really didn't disappoint. The Philadelphia Roll is one of my favorites in general and it was okay.   Service was pretty slow, but everyone was very friendly and you could tell the regulars as they interacted with the staff quite a bit and really enjoyed themselves. The fact that they have regulars and are quite friendly is a testament to them.   Personally, I didn't come out of there thinking, man I have to go back it was that good. I would go back if I was eating with someone that wanted to eat there, but it won't be a place that I will necessarily recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever I'm in the PATH I make the effort to seek out this place for a healthy and reasonably priced lunch. The family who own it are so friendly and it really makes my day every single time.  They offer a complimentary miso soup with your purchase and sometimes there is room to sit inside if it isn't too busy."}
{"text":"Je suis amoureuse des sushis. J'ai essayé plusieurs restaurants de sushis à Montréal mais Sushi Q est mon préféré jusqu'a maintenant avec un excellent rapport qualité prix. J'espère qu'ils ne vont pas baisser en qualité en fonction de leur notoriété qui augmente. J'y ai mes habitude et mon chef favori reste le propriétaire que nous avons surnommé monsieur sushi.   Je vous conseille de faire comme nous et de commander leurs délicieux plateaux si vous êtes nombreux. sinon leur combo sont superbes aussi."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving.  This little hole in the wall has great service and is absolutely delicious sushi and I'm picky!"}
{"text":"Saturday night. Opening weekend of Spring Training. 1 chef. Long waits between food delivery.   Ayce is limited in variety unless you really like California rolls. There are 5-6 different ones."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just got through eating there and we were both so impressed with the restaurant that I created this account to tell you about it.   It is a smaller place with about 13 tables, mixed from 2 person to 8 persons and the sushi bar had stools all the way around. The atmosphere was very sophisticated and quiet. It made it very calm and easy to look at. There were 2 t.v.'s one was on channel TNT with The Goonies playing and the other was golf. Both were on mute and there was music playing. I don't recall the station but it was a local radio station.  When we entered we were immediately greeted and seated by our waiter, he didn't give us his name though. Got some drinks and started to look over the menu. Our waiter had great knowledge of the menu and was helpful in making our selections. I order the Teriyaki Chicken while my boyfriend order(off the sushi menu) two(one for a friend) Hawaiian Poki, The Dragon Roll, Quail Eggs, Soft Shell Crab, Scallops and The Fresh Water Eel (needless to say he was hungry). We received our food very quickly. My chicken was good and had a great flavor but was a little dry. The sushi was \"amazing\" my boyfriend said and I was impressed with it. Both of the presentations were good and I was impressed with how the sushi maintained its shape and didn't fall out or into pieces. The exact quote from my boyfriend was \"I'm sorry you don't like fish but this is SO good and we ARE coming here more often!!!\" The bill was $62.00 but we got a lot of food.  I would go back there again and recommend this place to anyone who likes sushi you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times. The sushi is good quality for the price. Service is always quick and pleasant. I recommend this place for anyone looking for good quality sushi at a low price"}
{"text":"Sushi here is to-go, and although they do offer seating you will still be eating out of plastic.  That said, the sushi is tasty and fresh! I can't speak for the sashimi or anything, but a basic boring sushi eater like myself (cucumber avacado roll and miso soup, please!) can get a decent lunch here for $7 or less.   It's affordable, quick and convenient. Hits the spot for lunch every time!"}
{"text":"Great chicken fried rice and it was a huge plate. It was worth the wait for the grand opening"}
{"text":"I come here all the time since it's in the same shopping center as the market! The sushi is always fresh and tasty at a very reasonable price.   They offer a pretty good selections of rolls and sushis but the hot/cooked options seems limited.   I always get the pre made sushi boxes since it has a great combo of rolls, fresh and fast! The ladies that work there are always super nice and accommodating to my picky kids and their special orders!  Overall it's a great place to get take out or grab a quick lunch not really a place to have a nice date night dinner. Since it's in the middle of the shopping center and there are people walking by."}
{"text":"When I walked in, I was pleasently surprised by the decor. It was filled with Oriental decorations, plants, etc. It wasn't sparsely decorated either. I pretty much sat there looking around at all the pictures, swords, blinds, etc. I was greeted by a woman dressed in a giesha outfit. It was really nice until I noted she was wearing Puma socks with her flip flops. But points for an almost complete outfit.  If your alone, I suggest just sitting at the bar. Happy Hour is all day so your handed a sheet that you mark the quantity next to what  they have on the list. You also got a menu for the rolls (not happy hour) and a regular quantity sheet. So three things are given to you and boy was I not only nervouse but confused!   I ordered off menu, the Arizona roll. For $9.95 and about 10 pieces, I feel it was worth it. I also ordered the Hand Roll: Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Tuna and California. The hand rolls are bigger than what I orginially thought so it was a lot of food. They were all delicious but the Shrimp Tuna hand roll was my favorite.  The waitress was nice even if she didn't really explain what to do. But thats forgiven as I'm the type to speak up and ask questions. In all, it was a nice visit and a place I will definently be back.  It looks kinda sketchy next to a Liquor store and dealing with all the light rail constructions plus the nieghborhood isn't the greatest. But its blocks from where I live so I'll def be back."}
{"text":"Sought out this restaurant on the recommendation of a colleague. It's behind an unassuming storefront in a run-down strip mall next to a seedy liquor store. If it hadn't been for the strong recommendation, I'd have taken one look at this place and kept on driving. But I'm so glad I went in! Two friends and I demolished a lot of fish through the AYCE menu. The quality and selection were very good considering it was AYCE. For about $24 + tax it was an excellent deal."}
{"text":"Great little sushi spot with a heck of an all-u-can eat deal.  I like it.  The staff is great, the food is great quality and the prices are fair.  My only complaint: Nearly every time I leave Sushi Q I get hit up by the pan handlers working the liquor store next door.  4 stars for price, quality, and staff."}
{"text":"It's my favourite sushi take-out place in the area. I've eaten here for years and have never been disappointed.   The food is very fresh and also beautiful to look at. I get mesmorized when I see colours of fresh salmon, tuna, avocado and roe just pop out from their trays. It's like an abstract expressionist canvas of deliciousness.   Apart from having reasonable prices (given the area) and a complimentary miso soup with your meal, this Sushi-Q isn't open in the evenings or on weekends.  The restaurant is small and the tables usually fill up come noon. It's a grab-and-go kind of a place. If it's summer, just go upstairs and outside to eat in the courtyard."}
{"text":"Aye was pretty good. Fish was fresh rolls were tasty. Not the best spicy scallop I've had as I didn't care for the white sauce. Service was pretty fast and friendly. Nice find!"}
{"text":"Si vous recherchez un excellent rapport qualité prix avec un bon service, alors ne cherchez plus! Sushi Q is for You!  Produits toujours frais et de bonne qualité!  Beaucoup de choix à  l unité et un choix de combos vraiment abordable!  Il y a des combos prêts à emporter en fonction de toutes les faims!  On peut ajouter salade et soupe miso.  Une fois qu on commence, c est dur de ne pas revenir!"}
{"text":"Would not go back. Sushi was all rice. No fish. I can't believe they have return customers. We did the ayce and we didn't like a single roll. For $24 a person they give you nothing. I don't leave bad reviews but in still upset about this place."}
{"text":"Vraiment, un petit bijou dans un Centre d'achats.  Les grands noms de Montreal n'ont qu'- aller se rhabiller.  Fraîcheur, quantité de poisson, goût pour un prix plus qu'abordable."}
{"text":"My fiance and I moved into an apartment down the street and happened to drive by this place one night.  We saw a sign for all you can eat sushi on the front and were eventually enticed to come in.  (FYI - The all you can eat sushi is about $24 per person - definitely a good price for sushi.)  My fiance and I ordered a total of 4 rolls - the 2006, Las Vegas, spicy tuna, rainbow.  It was amazing - probably my 2nd favorite sushi place in AZ.  I like the fact that this place is very small, fast and hospitable service, and you can see the sushi chef making your sushi."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for good quality fish, it's located in a strip mall and yes it's right next to a liquor store where there are frequent loiterers.   I wanted to stop in and take advantage of their happy hour that starts at 5 P.M. on Saturday, I wound up to a mostly empty restaurant but was seated comfortably at the bar.  I ordered the Yellowtail Roll, Salmon Sashimi and Vegetable Tempura which is all on the Happy Hour menu for a pretty decent price. The Yellowtail Roll was good, buttery soft fish and fresh tasting, tasted awesome with a small smear of wasabi and tiny dip into soy sauce. The Salmon sashimi was good, although a bit small for $4.50 but soft and tender. The sashimi comes with three pieces. The Vegetable Tempura was good, a little bit thicker with the batter here, but came with an onion ring, zuchini, sweet potato and a green bean and dipping sauce. Perfect portion for a single person!  The sushi chef and the waitress were sweet and attentive to myself and the other diners here and yes, they are Korean! But that doesn't mean they know how to make some good sushi rolls/food!  Happy Hour is decent depending on what you order, if you're looking to get full order a meal or a roll that has lots of stuff in it. For my roll, sashimi and tempura on happy hour the meal was about $13, but $15 with tip."}
{"text":"I've been passing this joint for more than 2 years and I finally tried the place out. Initially the staff was surprised I came in for food. Very friendly. A misunderstanding with the menu, however what I ate was delicious. I had yellowtail 2 piece, a tuna roll and spicy tuna roll. Very delicious. I got out of there for about $15 after tip. The ambiance is very calming and peaceful. Considering the chaos that ensues because of light rail construction I had a great meal and I plan to come again."}
{"text":"They did not get a single thing right with our order. We waited over 40 minutes for any sushi at all. Called in advance and were told we could do the all you can eat sushi....arrived and was told nope sorry too late. Will never eat here again"}
{"text":"When I'm really craving a sushi fix and I don't want to trudge up to Yuzu due to the weather or I'm just being killed at work and have no time, I come here.  It's possibly the best fast food take out sushi in the Financial district.  It's tucked away from the mayhem of the big Commerce Court food court and it's beside Four (also known as 'Four servings to fill me' but that's another story).    The great thing about this place is that it's run by a lovely family who is dedicated to their business.  I come in around 8 am each morning and I already see them chopping away at the vegetables for all their maki rolls.  They're friendly and when you get to be a repeat customer, they do make an effort to know you.  With your selection, they offer free miso soup which is a bonus to all other places nearby.  The soup is your usual fare but it's free!  The variety here ranges from brown rice california rolls to spicy salmon maki to 8 pieces of salmon sushi.  Prices are not exorbiant and probably the most reasonable in the area.  The quality is on par with most AYCE places so it's definitely not bad sushi at all.  If anything, I would say that it's consistently decent and a suitable place for a fix.  If you happen to be in the area and it's after 4 pm, prices get slashed and it's essentially 50% off everything.  So if you want to a sushi snack on the GO train or TTC before heading home, head to this place and you'll definitely find something to grab.  I'll admit the pickings sometimes are slim but once in a while you can get a full lunch sushi set for 50% off."}
{"text":"One night during my visit to Arizona, I was extremely hungry and craving sushi. Dining at traditional sushi restaurants was not an option ($$$$). I searched all over town for AYCE sushi and Sushi Q was the only restaurant that Yelp returned within Chandler, Mesa, Tempe, Phoenix, and Scottsdale. I jumped into my car and quickly roared out to Sushi Q at around 7:00pm. Sushi Q is located in a strip mall next to a seedy liquor store. When I arrived during happy hour, there were only 3 people in the restaurant! There's no need to beat the dinner rush here.   I sat at the bar and designated myself as an AYCE customer. After perusing the order menu, I was upset to discover an 8 order limit on the nigiri. 8 orders = 16 pieces. When I eat AYCE sushi in California, I typically average ~50 pieces, with a personal record of 64. Nobody cares how much you order in California, as long as you don't throw up on premises. Apparently not the case in stingy Arizona.  The nigiri menu is sparse with limitations to the basic fish. Uni was not an option on the menu. Neither were any premium fish (not even off the AYCE menu). I ordered the standard choices: albacore, mackerel, red snapper, tuna, salmon, shrimp, scallop, and yellowtail. The rice was served at room temperature as it should be. The fish quality of the tuna, salmon, and red snapper was acceptable, but the presentation for the other sushi was poor. Excessive ponzu sauce and green onions were applied on top of the yellowtail, mackerel, and albacore, to the point where I could not taste the distinct flavor of each fish. See photos for the sloppy preparation and the overuse of onions. The quality was disappointing even for a Korean sushi chef.  For economic purposes, Sushi Q expects AYCE customers to fill up on appetizers and rolls rather than the fish. I feared leaving with a half full stomach, so I ordered rolls and appetizers after the nigiri. Rolls do not have order limits, but premium rolls were strategically removed from the AYCE menu. I asked for the negi salmon roll, yellowtail roll, and rainboll roll. The rolls were handled by a Hispanic sushi chef. The rainbow roll was standard, although the rice was a bit stiff. Yellowtail roll was a salty disaster, with excessive garlic/chili sauce drenched over the fish that spread to the rice. Fortunately, the negi salmon roll was acceptable with minimal sauces used and generous amount of salmon in each piece.   Be aware that appetizers are full orders. I ordered agedashi tofu expecting just a few pieces of hot tofu. Instead, I received a basket full of fried tofu enough to feed a family of 3. The agedashi tofu was a joke. It was supposed to be served in a broth with Katsuobushi, Japanese onions, some rice wine, and soy sauce, but all that was given was a bowl of soy sauce separated from the tofu.  In the end, I left with a full stomach but was dissatisfied with the quality of food consumed. I came to eat sushi but was instead instructed to order mediocre rolls engulfed in puddles of assorted sauces. The 16 piece limit is a severe limitation that renders the AYCE option as not cost-effective ($23.95 for dinner)."}
{"text":"Greeted by the people right away when I stepped into the store. I noticed that the prices here are pricey but I can tell that the fish they use are fresh! I got the salmon lover 1 and it was $10. It came with 2 packs of soy sauce (I was used to one so I was surprised to see 2) and free miso soup so that compensated for the price. The sushi itself was really good, I would definitely come back to try their other pre-made sushi if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I decided to have dinner here after reading other reviews, and the all you can eat option sounded really cool.  The location of the restaurant is, in a word, weird. It's located in a run down strip mall, next to a seedy looking liquor store. Nonetheless, I decided to give it a try. First off, the \"all you can eat\" menu is very complicated, restricting you to certain items on the menu and a maximum quantity by type (eh rolls vs nigiri). To be fair, the maximums are generous and I cant imagine any normal person going away hungry--but it's technically not all you can eat.  The biggest problem was the sushi rice, which was really, really vinegary. To the point where I couldn't  hardly taste the fish.  Oddly, I only noticed it with the nigiri pieces. The two rolls I got were both tasty.  If you decide to go, I'd recommend you stick with rolls and forego the AYCE option...or better yet, seek out an alternate choice with better reviews."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from sushi purchased from the PATH, but Sushi Q uses really fresh fish and they are probably the only restaurant that you can grab your food, pay, and be out of there in less than a minute.  So efficient.  I have never eaten in here before, but there appear to be a few tables available, and they give you free miso soup with your rolls, which is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"All you can eat (A.Y.C.E) or order off the menu. I am a big sushi fan and normally won't do anything \"all you can eat\"  but this was a great spot.  \"Park\", the sushi chef, even let us order some things that weren't on the regular AYCE menu.  Cold beer and several Sake choices both cold and hot.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'll be back for a second try when in Phoenix.  Everything was actually very good.  Their \"All You Can Eat\" is slightly limited in terms of options but there's enough available to make you happy.  We'll see you next time Sushi Q......"}
{"text":"Service is good.  A little pricey even for happy hour.  Too much mayo on the spicy items."}
{"text":"Was here with my family for lunch...All you can Sushi cost $23...server is horrible--with no sense of personal space...keep on telling my husband, thats  'FOR YOU ONLY'..since I did not order the all you can eat...she gave us half full cup of water and keep on getting every dish not in use including the one that I needed...what a wreck...  Sushi was horrible (according to my hubby)...worst sushi place I've ever been to. We are always looking for a good sushi place..my husband loves sushi and I love japanese soup..  No free soup/salad..edamame is served fresh out of the microwave (dry and uncooked) for $2.50..  Bathroom is filthy. Ambiance is so dead.."}
