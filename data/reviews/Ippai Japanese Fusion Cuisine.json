{"text":"Where to begin? Impossible to read menu font, typos, bland food, expensive, fusion crap. Two ramen. Super salty, meats were flavourless, broth(the soul of ramen) was salt with a hint of soy sauce.  The ramen itself was bland beyond imagination, even my Spanish (typo for spinach) ramen. Also ordered a black dragon roll, which took forever, tasted not fresh, and had mayonnaise in it (damn fusion)

Overall not good. 2/5 means we wouldn't come back ourselves, only if friends came. 

The bill came and I was sorely temper to change to 1 star. 

30 bucks. Not satisfied."}
{"text":"It was A-OK indeed.  Ordered ramen and small sushi / sashmi platter.  Soup was ok.  Not too impress with the ramen.  But location is nice if you live around Markham/Richmondhill."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy this place. Their sushi was very yummy (try the spicy salmon.. SOOO good!) 

The menu is kind of hard to read, but they have a huge selection of things which makes it good for large groups. It also is sort of expensive, so go during lunch time on the weekdays! They have a lunch special menu during then. 

I've only tried the sushi things whereas my boyfriend has gotten a bento and the super spicy ramen. He ordered a level 3 and it was ridiculous! If you're looking for a challenge.. eat the spicy ramen!

Overall, staff were attentive and kind. I can't wait to go get some more spicy salmon rolls! yummmmm"}
{"text":"Oct 13, 2013.  I always order lunch take out from here. Today I walked with my usual desire but was surprised to find a new look - no changes to the decor but the waitress was wearing bright Japanese dress. Very nice. And I was told there is a change of ownership just two days ago. I was presented a new menu. There are a lot more varieties on it and the price is a bit more than before too. I tried a lunch menu item, salmon teriyaki and sushi. Boy the quantity almost scared me -- I will try posting a picture if I can figure out how to do it. So big a meal. Given the quantity I fully expect the quality to suck, but NO. The salmon was great and the rolls were superb! Vege under salmon has too much onion, rice is a bit too sticky, but overall it is great taste. I seriously hope this is their all-time-quality and not just newly-opened-special-quality. Keep my fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"My husband is on the search for decent ramen in Toronto.  Ippai was another one that came up on the list.

We arrived for an early dinner, so it was relatively quiet.  Lots of tables and booths for seating.    

There are fair amount of options for ramen.  I tried the milk soup ramen.  I enjoyed the broth, it was not too milky and the broth has a light flavour.  I am not one that particularly enjoys broth that is too salty or thick.  The portion was good with a fair amount of  noodle and toppings.  The chasu was moderately fatty.  The prices are about $10-12 per bowl.  My husband tried the supreme pork bone soup but didn't really enjoy the broth.  The broth was not very tasty.  

The menu is huge - combos, rice dishes, appetizers, sushi and more.  The wings were meh.  We tried a tofu and sashimi appetizer - it was surprisingly good.  I'm guessing it's hit and miss because there is so much to choose from.

Will need to go back and try more dishes and the other ramen noodles."}
{"text":"OMG just went back here last weekend and the Extreme Spicy Ramen will burn a hole in you! I usually can handle spicy foods pretty well, but this was just ridonkulous (stupidly ridiculous). The spice level is on a level of 1-5. I ordered a 2 and that was too much for me. I think next time I go back I'll order a 0.5... Phew!"}
{"text":"Purchased a voucher for a Dinner for 2 a few months back, and finally got around to using it. Was quite surprised at the food; everything we had was very tasty. Overall, the meal was very tasty ... highlights were the rolls and the Seafood Okonomiyaki. Would definitely consider going back if we were in the area, even though we're coming in from the Mississauga area."}
{"text":"I seldomly dislike food, so I really don't know where to begin with this review.

For never ordering Ramen from an A La Carte Ramen menu, I was actually quite excited to give this place a try given the reviews it's received.

Tenderous Rib Ramen
Supreme Pork Bone Soup Ramen
Spider roll
Spicy Salmon roll

The meat I received was definiety not rib meat, it was chinese style stew beef, that is usually served cold in thin slices.. haha

That was the worse attempt of pork bone soup ever. I think the night clean guy at my work would make a better pork bone soup.

Those noodles are not fresh, nor frozen. They are instant noodles!

The two most common rolls were horrible. Refried softshell crab & the spicy salmon roll was made all wrong.

I definitey expected more from a japanese fusion kitchen at dinner hours.

Food : below par
Service : above average, friendly

would I return to give them another shot? 
No, If I was craving for Ramen or Japanese I'll go next door to Kaze up on Elgin Mills"}
{"text":"Decided to come here as it was recently renovated. While the decor looks nice, the food does not live up to neither the look of the restaurant or the price. While the food is decent, you can find much better tasting Japanese food elsewhere. The service was OK for the most part, but it could have been better, as we had to wait a little too long for the bill after asking for it."}
{"text":"Over Priced.....

Food was7/10- loved the choice in Ramen. I got the Extreme Spicy, the waitress indicted most people got 1, I never hesitate to get Suicide wings and cautiously went w a 3, I should have gone 5 but would have worked hard (and enjoyed).

Won't return due to price."}
{"text":"Ordered ramen and gyoza dumplings - both were nowhere as good compared to Kenzo Ramen (yonge/dundas). The pork bone soup ramen here at Ippai lacked flavour and the ramen was hard. they gave us 5 tiny gyoza dumplings which were basically $1 a piece, biggest rip off ever (the dumplings at Kenzo are $7 for 6, but each one is huge and pretty much a meal in itself). I cannot judge the other menu items, but based on their mediocre ramen and dumplings, i would not come back a second time"}
{"text":"I came to ippai many times before and always had the ramen and the garlic butter bimbimbap. I usually really liked their food and was impressed with the quality. But recently I went again and it came to my attention that ippai was bought by someone else cause i felt like the food quality has failed. Hopefully they're just having a rough start and it'll get better."}
{"text":"Daikoku Sushi & Ramen Bistro has closed down...and is replaced by this pretty similar ramen restaurant. I liked that you can choose your own ingredients, noodle type and soup base (spicy or non); no vegetarian options however, as all soup is pork based. 

They also do sushi, which I did not eat. I read other reviews that said the sushi was unique & I can agree only based on the pictures on my placemat (kiwi topped sushi? i'd try that!)

The ramen was only okay; not great, but certainly not bad. It might earn more stars if the overall meal had cost less or if the food was crazy amazing. To give you an idea, I had spicy soup 5.50, regular ramen no $add, chicken 2.00 & a boiled egg 1.00. for a total of $8.50. This is not a bad price for ramen, but I expected to be wow-ed and I wasn't really. The chicken didn't taste very fresh - next time I am going to get a fried meat. 

Nevertheless, it had nice decor and seating & despite my above review, I really appreciate the variety and would go back to get something different.  I do want to go back and try the milk base soup, or the soy milk based soup!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner yesterday.  Considering that I had a sushi overload in the last two weeks - I didn't want anymore sushi.  I opted for the ramen option and it was great!  I ordered the red miso ramen.  It contained seaweed, naruto, fish balls, and pork.  I found it much better than a lot of the ramen places that I've been to.  I was surprised.

Afterward, I ordered the green tea crême brulée - that was really good too (however, was too sweet in the end when I was almost done).

Overall, great service again."}
{"text":"My wife bought a Redflagdeal voucher for this restaurant ($39.95 for a dinner-for-2 mega combo valued at $83) and we tried this restaurant for the first time this past Friday.  What a disappointment.  The basic, hard-to-screw-up items such as rolls, miso soup and salad were average at best.  The tempura shrimps were decent, but the tempura vegetable pieces were sliced too thick and barely cooked and not enjoyable.  The teriyaki chicken rice bowl was lacking in appeal and taste (skinless meat that had no colour and seem more like blanched and broiled or seared), the sushi pizza dough was too thick and not crispy, and there was one other cooked item that I don't even know what it is (possibly pan fried tofu patty) but tasted awful.  Despite what was said on the voucher, I serious doubt the value of the combo was $83.  That was by far the worst japanese cuisine I've ever had in my 47 years of existence (and Japanese food is my favourate and I've had many over the years.  I would not go back to that restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here tonight based on a few reviews from friends who have told me about this place.  excellent selection menu with your usually sushi faves.  Also had a good selection of Ramen soups all around $10 - $13 a bowl.  I ordered the Spicy Ramen (had a scale of spicy from 1 - 5) and had a 1.  It was decently spicy and around what I could eat.  I could have ordered a 2 but this was pretty spicy enough.  I asked the waitress who orders a 5?  She even mentioned they have a .5 as well for some who don't want the spice as much!  She said some people order the 5 but then they need a pitcher of water to fight it down.  Was a little disappointed with the spinach sesame.  Looked like it was prepared in the morning and had a bit of sesame flavour but I expected a bit more.  Also ordered a salmon crunch roll.  It came out looking nice but as well lacked some flavour.  It was also on the smaller side.  I will return here as I do think they have many other options and will post the review again."}
{"text":"Took my bff for her belated bday lunch as it was her choice! Lots of variety! Its cool how they have a big selection or ramen as well a sushi, sashimi and bento boxes! Will definitely come back to try their sashimi specials! Wish they have salmon specials!"}
{"text":"Sorry but the quality has gone downhill since whenever I started coming here. The ramen is still \"alright\" but their sushi and rest of the food seems to have gone to a new low. 

Sushi is like all you can eat sushi quality. There are far too many alternatives to go to. Sorry for the harsh review but I was quite dissapointed. Its probably since this place isn't as busy as it used to be. I don't even see their fresh fish menu and their fish tank is super clean and empty now."}
{"text":"Dropped by on Monday evening and redeemed the Internet coupon for the free sashimi.. and was so disappointed. 

The size now is so much smaller.. the fish cut really thin and small. Imagine imitation crab and cheaper cut was offered.. Yes I know it is complimentary and I should not complain.. but... 

Shabu Shabu ($12.95) was disappointing... I can tell you there's hardly enough for 1 person.. I was still hungry after I finished eating that! And the ingredients are not much better than AYCE at Hipot! So skip that! 

I will stick with my Ramen next time I am here!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight with a friend.  I was thinking of getting my usual fare which was Chiraishi Don, but as I scanned through the menu (couldn't find Chiraishi Don, but found Hiraishi Don which may be a typo) I saw Salmon and Salmon Roe Irashi Don.  Just one quick verification from our server and he confirmed that it was what I think it was (salmon sashimi on rice).  Immediately ordered that one, regardless of the price $13 before taxes and tip.

When it arrived, the size itself was very disappointing.  It's less than half I would get from the other cheaper places that's for sure.  However, the dish itself was flavorful.  So much so that after talking with friends while eating that I didn't feel hungry at all, I would even say I was satisfied, though I couldn't because I ordered one other appetizer to share with a friend after eating.

That appetizer was the deep fried shrimp heads $5 for a small plate that I could theoretically inhale in a couple of minutes.  It was good, I never eaten something like that before (or at least not as a dish, I've eaten whole deep fried shrimp before).

Overall, I was happy with the food, like I said it is pretty pricey for what you get.  Although you'd get satisfied as a gourmet, it's not the place to go to when you're really hungry.

Although....

I still have to try their ramen, that's my next dish going there.  The pictures look really good."}
