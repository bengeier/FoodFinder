{"text":"We sat upstairs and ordered the Yorkville cheese plate to start. The blue cheese was the best of the pack.  Outstanding.  The lobster Mac and Cheese is a must.  Our lobster pieces were larger than the one reviewer mentioned but still not abundant.  In any case, it was still fantastic.  We would come back here."}
{"text":"Do not go here! The male bartender and male server with the glasses were two of the rudest servers I have encountered in the industry. Of course you expect ritzy in Yorkville but these individuals were adult bullies.  My girlfriends and I came in for a quick glass of wine before heading to an evening event and their attitude was appalling because we did not order food. This is a wine and cheese bar! Your target clientele is coming to Carens for drinks. I don't expect this restaurant to last as it does not live up to Yorkville standards. I would try Sassafraz down the street!"}
{"text":"Here with friends for dinner on weekday. Had reservations. Brutal. Waited 2 hrs for food. All came at different times - some 45 minutes after another. We watched each other eat. Bathrooms dark. Was really a disappointment."}
{"text":"Fantastic double B's!  Carens like many Yelplers have mentioned is probably one of the least expensive and less pretentious places in Yorkville but hey, it is still not really cheap.   I really like the ambience at Carens. You'll find a corner that suits your mood. If you like people watching, sit at the front patio. If you like a bit of privacy head to the back patio. And if you want total privacy and a more romantic setting, sit upstairs. Of course, there's not such thing as privacy at Carens whenever it's packed, especially on the weekends.   Pretty decent selection of red and white and if you don't know much about wine, the staff are really helpful. The cheese is also good but I'm not a huge fan cheese platters and if you're like me and just want an appetizer with your wine, I highly recommend the baked brie. Simply the best double B's I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"I just had a dinner meeting at this restaurant, on my recommendation, and I am completely mortified. Our waiter from the beginning gave us attitude, almost hit me in the face a couple of times while serving our wine and water and pretty much threw our cheese plate at us. After about an hour and half  we asked when our mains were coming and we were given more of  the same..ie. under his breath comments and sucking in of his teeth!!!!!  Thank you and for this our bill was $600!!!"}
{"text":"Carens is one of those every occassion places - a quick bite before a movie, winding down after a long day, meeting friends for dinner on a Friday, cocktails at the bar, wine & chesse apres a meal elsewhere - it seems to have been appropriate for almost every need I've had.  The cheese menu is extensive and the wine pairings are excellent.  While Carens may be known for wine & cheese, their meals are fabulous too!  Love the linguini and risotto and I challenge you to find a better mac'n'cheese!  The atmosphere - both inside and out - is highly conducive to great conversations and fun times!!!  P.S. And they have Gewurtztraminer by the glass - bonus!!!"}
{"text":"It was my second time here and while last time we had a large group and ordered cheese plates and wine, this time I was here for dinner with a friend.  We sat in the nice back patio area that had some style!  The food was great - especially the mac and cheese. The crab cakes were a little fishy.  The cheese plate (sheep) was great.  The waitress was not the friendliest and quite snobby but the waiter made us feel valued.  We'll be back!  Great find in Yorkville at the end of the road. Not very well seen from the street."}
{"text":"Caren's is totally a chick restaurant. All the lady details are looked after: chenille blankets hung over chairs on the patio to drape across your lap when it gets cooler at night, small portions, appetizers presented in fresh and sexy ways, like on blocks of wood instead of plates.  And, a lot of chicks go here. And by chicks, I mean, I have lunch with my mom at Caren's all the time. Caren herself is usually around and is happy to stop and chat with customers or get hands on with the service.  My favourite is the pan seared tuna appetizer.  Prices are decent for Yorkville, expensive for a student budget. Average app: $10-$12, Main: $20-$30 approx."}
{"text":"this place is super wierd: hostess is arrogant, food is o erpriced and we had to wait fosuper long time to get it and my looks like my mojito did not have any alcohol."}
{"text":"I always want this place to work and every time I go it's missing a je ne sais quoi. The hidden patio is truthfully what makes this place a hidden gem. I recommend you come here for drinks and maybe have some cheese and charcuterie and stop there. Entrees are just ok. It's a bizarre mix of italian, french bistro and other randomness. Staff while friendly just don't have the polish that I expect from a yorkville address. I sometimes feel like everyone who works there are actors or extras hired to pretend to be waiters for the night. I will probably end up back here and still leave with the same \"i don't get why this place can't be better\" thoughts."}
{"text":"Love a night with the girls here, or even suitable for a date! The patio in the back is gorgeous and they have great service and an awesome menu."}
{"text":"Sat on the back patio which is charming. Our server was knowledgeable, funny and efficient. So far this is my favourite place for mac n cheese in Toronto. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Last night I was poisoned by their sea food, never going back. Writing the review from the hospital while receiving fluid and pills, thanks for ruin my Sunday and my stomach."}
{"text":"This is a cozy place with great food and service was pretty good! Love their Platters and lobster Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I have dined at Carens Yorkville several times throughout the years, and have also tried their new Rosedale outpost. To date, the Yorkville location remains my go-to spot in the city for a great selection of wine and cheese.  While I've tried their other more substantial dishes, I would suggest ordering what they do best - cheese. I quite enjoy the different platters offered on the menu, which take the guesswork out of the selection process (and thus minimizing the time until I can eat)!   I've had the same server pretty much every time I've dined here, and while not overly friendly, he is knowledgeable and accommodating."}
{"text":"If you want to spend a wonderful evening enjoying cheese and wine... this is your place. I love sitting on the bar and enjoying the wonderful cheese selection. They also have a nice patio in the back for the summer days. indoor seatings are in the first and second floor (i prefer the 1st floor). the dinner menu is nice and tasty. enjoy"}
{"text":"I've eaten here about half-a-dozen times, and have always had a good experience. The servers have always been helpful and informative when needed, but never intrusive and never interrupting the conversation at the table.  The selection of wines and cheeses is very good, and there are a lot of good bottles under $70.    The atmosphere and decor are warm and inviting, especially on the back patio.  The only reason not to give 5 stars is that the menu is very small, with just a few mains to choose from.  Everything I've eaten has been very good, but a little more variety would be the final element to take it to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I would actually give this place a 3.5 stars, but sadly not because of the food - and that usually drives the rating I give the restaurant overall.  Let me also caveat this - I like wine, but I'm not a cheese person.    Decor:  Loved it!   You step into the restaurant and it seems pretty small until you they take you out to the back where they have a whole other section with a view of the sky.  I haven't seen many places in Toronto that has this kind of atmostphere.  It's quiet out back and you can sit there when it rains as well (which I got to experience).    When we arrived, it wasn't raining.  However, 10 minutes later, it started pouring.  Thankfully, I was seated in the areas that they had the tarp overhead.    Service:  Pretty good.   Very friendly service and they come by quite often asking if you need anything.  The waiter was not as knowledgeable about the menu as I would like.  (they forgot what were the specials of the day)  Food: Okay The food was the disappointing part.  I ordered the shrimp bisque and I asked if this was enough for lunch.  The waiter said it was if I got the full size.  Turns out, not true.  Now, unless they thought because of my smaller size I have a small stomach, a watery bowl of shrimp bisque is not going to fill anyone up, especially if it doesn't come with bread.    We also followed this up with a cheese order (I was still hungry).  We got the pecorino and it well with the grape pairing.  It also tasted like parmesan to me, but once again, I caveat - I'm not a cheese person.    Overall, if you like cheese and want a restaurant with a good quiet atmosphere, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, Amazing bartender who helped my poor ignorant self, with some nice wines to go with our food.. We started with a cheese sample, some sort of Quebec special, then some oysters, Lobster Mac and cheese.. All were great, service was excellent. Great place. Check it out, and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Loved Caren's, it is this cozy little restaurant. Went there with my girlfriend for dinner and we had a fantastic time. We didn't make a reservation so they had to sit us at the Bar, which wasn't a problem at all. The bar tender was really friendly and helpful.   Had the Yorkville Cheese Platter, it was so good, I almost finished it all by myself! The main course was delicious, my friend had the fish can't remember whether it was the cod or the sea bass, doesn't matter, she loved it. The chef changes the specials on a regular basis so you are stuck with a boring menu.   Like the previous reviewer has commented, it is the perfect place to unwind on a Friday night after a long week."}
{"text":"Caren's is one of the Toronto treasures that gives me the utmost pleasure and happiness. I've had lunch and dinner there and I love almost every aspect of it! I don't visit when it's not summer, just because I'm so enchanted by the enclosed patio. All I ask in life is for intimate dates with my lover here, especially if we haven't seen each other in awhile and want to catch up.  The service is consistent and considerate and so far I've been lucky with the wine. I had the sausage pasta last time I visited and it was sooo yummmy! I wouldn't have made it better myself (who am I fooling, I couldn't make that!)...I really appreciated the tangy spices that complemented this dish.. Carens really is a delight.."}
{"text":"Oh, what the hell. After two or three more visits since I wrote my original review, it's time to bump up the rating to a perfect five. Caren's not only has great food at reasonable prices (I've enjoyed every single dish I've had there -- including yesterday's creamy garlic soup for lunch), it has the most romantic patio in the city. It's a perfect date place. Gentlemen, take my word for it. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"A Yorkville gem. Tucked away from the rest of the neighbourhood. The back patio will make you want to stay forever.  Best bet is the cheese fondue to share.   Other highlights include the burger with blue cheese and the Mac+cheese."}
{"text":"Wine. Cheese. Wine.. More cheese, please.. Wine... Cheese......Where did my wine go?  Carens is one of my new favourite spots in Yorkville! Right across the street from the Cumberland theater, it's the perfect spot to grab a glass and dinner before a film.  They have a lovely upstairs area for dudes to liquor up their dates...er I mean converse with their lady.  It's also a fun place to catch up with the girls. Reservations are recommended.    The back patio is just gorgeous. We were seated on wood benches by heat lamps.   Dim lit, warm, and ambient, I loved the hanging Moroccan style lanterns. Caren's is indeed a chick bar.    As expected, the wine list was global and extensive, ranging in price from reasonable to stupid expensive.  Any wines served by the glass can be served as a half-litre!  I feel like I should just carry around a ginormous wine glass (You know, like Big Joe from Cougartown).  The fondue for two ($22) was simple but goopy delicious.  A variety of cheeses mixed with a bit of white wine and kirsh, the fondue was mild and well balanced.  The accompanying bread was a bit stale, but I pretended I didn't notice.  Smothered in melted cheese, it was still satisfying!  We ordered chorizo as a side, which ended up being an excellent choice. The saltiness worked well with the cheese.  This place seems popular for groups or girly functions.  They have a few fixed price menus and hors d' oeuvre packages as well.  Even though I really enjoyed myself, the only downer was our server. Our server was surprisingly horrible.  I don't think he should have been serving at a wine bar.  He was such a downer.  I should have asked him for a diet coke."}
{"text":"I think this was Caren's house. And then she turned it into a bar."}
{"text":"The staff is so accommodating and funny, the ambiance on the patio in the back is rejuvenating, and the wine is lovely. The menu isn't really that incredible, but I've only been during the brunch and lunch hours so I've still to explore the dinner menu. This is becoming one of my \"Happy Places\" in the city but I'm not sure how I'll feel about it in the colder months when the patio is closed."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I loved eating at Caren's, but I am a cheap person.   Cheap in the sense that I feel I could just walk around the corner to Whole Foods, head to their cheese section and buy the cheese I want, rather than paying a hefty premium on it to have them slice it for me with some pears at this restaurant.  We took the Cumberland platter (seemed the best out of the lot), with Epoisse (love!), a nice melty cheese that has a bit of a Brie texture, it also came with Morbier (one little slice), which I prefer melted rather than raw, and Chaumes which made me think of sweaty socks. I'd avoid that one. A few cut up pear slices on the platter, and it was $28. Personally, we could have probably bought the same amounts for $14, but it came with unlimited bread.  The cheese was served at the perfect temperature. Not too warm, not too cold.  We also tried the Pernod shrimp platter but I found that for the price of $18 (?) it was skimpy with only 4 shrimp. The platter and shrimp was also a bit cold when it came out, which made me think that it sat at the counter too long.  The main course we shared was the spicy baked mac and cheese, which I liked, but I think the cheese gets a little oily/grainy when it's baked like that, and it wasn't just melted on top, which I would have preferred. When you overcook cheese, it breaks into small crumbly pieces and oil which is unappetizing. Still, I liked it... but the execution could have been better.  If you are a cheese newbie, come here to sample a few cheeses, then go buy the ones you like at Whole Foods and eat them at home. I'd also suggest the Brie de Meaux (my 2nd favourite brie, my first being Brie de Mellin), and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have to say my experience was...weird. I think it was an off-night and I got a really bad vibe from the start.  My girlfriend and I were in the area for a second bridesmaid dress fitting and I wanted to try this place. I called to say 2 people would be there within 5 minutes and the man responded they only had the upstairs or the patio. I was thinking, wow, the main floor must be something special, but in fact, when I entered the restaurant, the main dining area is tiny. One table is right in front of the stairs, so the awkward position means one person is always hit as people walk up and down the stairs. The upstairs level is much more quiet and romantic, and I am glad we sat there.  Service is slow. Our waitress was nice, but that's it. My duck was, disappointingly salty. My friend ordered this lobster risotto dish and the way our waitress explained was as if it would be big chunks. The reality was that the lobster bits were pea-sized.  The time between our appetizer and main felt forever, which is why when my main came, it was sad that I had to wait for something salty.  Glad I came so this place can be checked off. Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Patio weather is here and I love a nice cool wine- rose or white when it is like this. It's always great to have some cheese while sipping a red, though.  As I perused the menu, I was lucky enough to pick the wines they were out of, and some of the food options were out, too. Service was ridiculous on the patio in that we ran out of everything and would have ordered more if someone had bothered to ask. Instead we asked for the check the first time one of us got up to use the bathroom.  If you are a high-volume wine bar, but run out of things regularly, maybe just use a print out menu of what is in stock on a daily basis. It doesn't have to be fancy, but don't let me sit there for 10 minutes picking my wine and THEN tell me it's out. Yet another Yorkville let down for me."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if they have a new chef or something but the last couple times I ate here the food was just average. Our server also had a lot of attitude and was very unpleasant to deal with (the guy with glasses as mentioned in a number of other reviews). I don't think I'd go out of my way to return here, at least not any time soon. Hopefully Carens is just having a funky season or something because when they're good, they're really good."}
{"text":"Great location for slow service, sassy waiters, and a 5% unexplained tax upcharge on your total bill. However, you'll get to enjoy all of this in a pleasant backyard patio.   Oh yes, the food review:  Warm Organic Salmon with Lobster Croquette- $20 (3/10)-the three pieces of fried pastry covered in beet dressing overpowered the warm salmon slivers  Short Rib Ravioli - $18 - (4/10) - The sauce and short ribs were well prepared, however there was 3x the amount of sauce needed for the soggy pasta included in the small portion size  Wild Mushroom Risotto - $22 (3/10) - Risotto is a hard dish to master, you won't find the master here  Rating Summary:   Food: 3/10 - uninspiring, overly sauced, small portions  Atmosphere: 8/10 - pleasant backyard patio furniture with lots of natural sunlight  Service: 0/10 - the service was so terrible it likely skewed my rating for the food"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I have had in recent memory at a restaurant. We arrived for our 9pm reservation last Saturday  and were seated in the back patio. The decor was nice and we were looking forward to a three course set menu.   The waitress was slow to greet us and provide menus. So much so that after 10 minutes the hostess stopped by to see if she could offer water. In the interim we observed two unhappy tables. One table directly to our right was trying desperately to get the attention of staff to advise she was served the wrong entree. The girl finally brought her food back to the kitchen herself as her companions had almost completed their meals. The table diagonal to us was upset as half the table was served their appetizers and the other half had been waiting for an extended period of time.   After 20 more minutes our waitress stopped by with one menu to\"share\" and took an order for a pitcher of sangria. The drinks arrived shortly after at which point we were advised the kitchen was out of all entree choices with exception of the Mac and cheese. We were still agreeable at this point of time as we understand things happen. Little did we know that was the start of a 3.5 hour ordeal.   It began with the appetizers coming out incorrectly for my date- soup instead of salad 40 minutes after we had ordered originally. We did not see hide nor hair of our waitress during this time. We had finished our drinks and were looking to order additional beverages or at the very least get a refill on the water. When we finally saw our waitress - 50 minutes after we first arrived we were able to order a glass of wine.   It was another 54 minutes after this our dinner arrived. Again, during this time our waitress was MIA. During this time, we were left trying to flag down one of the other servers to try to find out an eta on the main course. The lovely blonde waitress on the other side of the back patio was apologetic and promised to send back our waitress as soon as she could find her. When dinner finally arrived, it was sub par at best. The meal was hot but relatively un-impressive after the wait. Again we were not offered the opportunity to order another drink or ask any questions.   It was another 45 minutes before our waitress stopped by. We asked to box the remainder of the meals to take with us, asked for desert, and the cheque. At that point the waitress advised us that they were out of both the cheesecake and chocolate cake we ordered at the beginning of the meal. We asked what our options were and she said she could provide a chocolate truffle dish as an alternative if \"we really needed dessert\".   30 minutes later - 1 plate arrived to share with what looked like 4 frozen individual  chocolates for the two of us. The plate arrived without forks and again the waitress quickly disappeared without an offer of coffee or tea.   The bill arrived approximately 15 minutes later. The waitress was kind enough to inform us and provide us a bill with a hand written tip amount of 18% written in and then manually calculated to include the combined tip and bill amount. It was distasteful at best. When I called her back loudly as she left with the intent to discuss - she glanced over her shoulder at us and then picked up the pace and left the area.   Needless to say we did not leave the 18% as indicated. As a side note we generally tip a minimum of 20% for service and 25% for great service. Ultimately, the appalling way we were treated by the waitress, the reduction of available menu items, and the wait time without apology was truly disappointing and will ensure we will not be returning.   On a high note- it was wildly entertaining to listen to the group of four seated diagonal to  us muse loudly as to the whereabouts of our missing waitress and to ponder why a chocolate lava cake and apple pie took over an hour to appear. The delightful storytelling was a laugh to listen to."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in Yorkville across the street from lululemon.  They have a small patio outside in the front and a larger patio in the back.  We opted to sit inside as the weather in TO was muggy and windy.  To start, we had raw oysters for an appy that was on special - 9 oysters for the price of 6!  The service was really good, our server was jovial and made our dining experience pleasant.  He was attentive and made sure we always had wine and water filled.  I had the lobster tagliatelle dish.  It had large chunks of lobsters in my pasta dish.  The sauce was a vodka tomato cream sauce which was not too heavy and just right.   Overall the experience was very nice.  I would like to come back and check out the patio in the back!"}
{"text":"buried treasure but with a couple of pirates :Yorkville:  I walk by Carens everyday on my way to work.  It caught my eye because it says wine and cheese.  Two of my most favourite things.  I never thought to go because I'm not a huge fan of restos in Yorkie.  But Kitty posted about Carens on her Facebook.  So it caught my interest again and held it, at least until I finally went.  BEST.PATIO.  And that is saying a lot.  Spoke Club's patio has long been a favourite.  Their food sucks, but their drinks are amazing and the patio is killer.  Well, was.  Carens wins.    The back patio is a hidden treasure.  Respect it.  It's a little piece of heaven.  Carens is great wine, impecable cheese, and pass-able mains.    Kitty and I shared the Okanagan pinot.  BC wine is my favourite.  She had the crab cakes, while I had the baked brie.  The crab cakes were alright.  But my brie and phyllo was off-the-charts. I loved it.   I had the stilton burger, and she had the special.  The special last night was black cod.  I am a black cod snob so this cod did not work for me. Fishy on a bed of bland Israeli couscous.  My burger, on the other hand, was good.  But the meal was too heavy.  My fault.  Stilton, 10 ounces of beef, sauteed mushrooms, and an onion bun.  And of course I paired mine with potato gratin.  In retrospect, perhaps I should have gotten the salad.  While the food wasn't amazing, the service (which was great) and the ambience more than made up for any lack lustre moments.  That is, until I tried to make a booking.  Management isn't all that business savvy.  Apart from quoting a RIDICULOUS minimum for a party of 20, and only one round of emails, I never heard from them again.  They just lost a BIG night out.  That's okay, their loss - someone else's gain.  Great restaurants are food and business.  If your food can't back you, your business should..."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I really recommend the blue and Brie fondue. But just make sure to read your receipt. We were overcharged on our wine, and when we called our waiter out, we were told it was a $1-$2 difference when it was really $16."}
{"text":"Over priced, bad food, bad service in Yorkville.    We were a group of 6 from work who went on a hot summer night.   The wine list is respectable, not amazing.    The food was just average to bad.  I had salmon which was dry and tasteless.   The 2 people in my party who had risotto were both ILL that night.    Our waiter was full of attitude but funny so we can forgive him for his typical Toronto jaded-waiter snobbery.     VERY disappointing and especially in Yorkville where you might expect at least a very nice meal.   Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at carens whether in the summer or the winter. The patio is really nice in the summer, they even give you blankets. It's outdoor so that gives it a cool vibe.   Upstairs is very romantic yet relaxed.  The cheese and wine selections are great, however the portions are not large. I would go to have a nice *tasting* of cheese and wine, not for a full out dinner event."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, gorgeous back patio. Prices are \"good for Yorkville.\"    1st time, a positive review ==================== I was impressed the first time I came and gave this place 4 out of 5 stars, knocking off the 1 star due to service. The waiter was friendly but VERY forgetful. It seemed his mind was elsewhere. Even waving our arms in the air while making eye contact with him couldn't get his attention.    Update:  July 11, 2012 ------------------------------ Last night, though, I returned and was VERY disappointed with the service and food. The first time, I had only a cheese plate and wine, both being very good. This 2nd time, our group ordered main entrées and shared a cheese plate to start.    2nd visit, a bad experience ====================== I had reserved a table in the back patio asking to be placed as far away as possible from the smoking section. (Why they have a smoking and non-smoking section on the same patio is beyond me.) The lady on the phone said she'd note the request. Well, turned out our table was right NEXT to the smoking section. DUH?   Fine, I understand a \"request\" can't always be honored, so I let that slide. But I still think it's unfair to allow smoking on both patios. Why not designate one for smoking and the other for non-smoking? Better yet, make the pretty back patio for non-smokers.    Rude, Ignorant Waiter ================= Anyway, the waiter last night had attitude and was clueless. No, really. He brought over our cheese platter and simply plopped it on our table and walked away without explaining what was what. We called him over and asked him to explain what the cheeses were and to bring us bread.   He returned and rattled off very quickly as if he couldn't be bothered wasting his time. \"This cheese is that, this is that...etc.\" (I think he had to quickly ask a colleague to tell him beforehand!)  I was startled when he said \"This cheese is Ossau-Iraty from Quebec.\" Uh, not. It's from the Basque region of France, near the Spanish border. But he insisted I was wrong. I know my Basque cheese, so I said \"Not at all.\"  A few minutes later he returned after having verified and said \"You're right it's from France.\"  Duh.  Sorry, but for $28 for 4 small wedges of cheese, I expect a server who:  a) explains what each cheese is at the time he brings the platter, and b) knows SOMETHING about cheese.   But when I tasted the cheese, I knew right away he had gotten mixed up the Ossau-Iraty with the cheese from Quebec, and vice versa. He was right in pointing to the Quebec cheese, but he named it wrong. I didn't tell him this cuz I knew he wouldn't give a rat's arse, and it wouldn't be worth my time. But come on, for these prices, the least you can do is to identify the cheeses correctly!   BAD Food ========= But the biggest disappointment was the food. We ordered the penne pasta with chicken and chorizo in a tomato basil sauce. You can get it mild or spicy. I ordered mild, my friend spicy. Both were very bland, and the pasta was soft, overcooked, not al dente.   I make pasta 10x better than that at home!  And for $18, this was a HUGE letdown. The quality of this pasta was I'd expect to find in a mall food court.    The hostess, however, was very good and on top of things.   After my 1st visit, I said I'd return, but now I know I won't. The waiter last night was clueless and with attitude, and the pasta was really pathetic."}
{"text":"Not unlike the most popular senior back in high school who suddenly asked me out after I gave my weird Grade 10 self a \"She's All That\"-style makeover (hi Chad!*), Carens is very good-looking and...well, that's about it.  The menu sounds great on paper, but the food is underwhelming and overpriced. Spicy Baked Mac & Cheese ($16, $21-32 with additions) is tasty as cheese-drenched starch generally is, but has none of the spice it advertises - it's just normal. I don't even like spicy food and I still thought it needed a kick. It does come piping hot in a respectably-sized dish, but without any sides to speak of, it leaves something to be desired. You'll likely need to order one of the salad appetizers to balance it out. Unfortunately, even a usually reliably flavourful standby like the Niçoise ($18) is pretty bland here.  Crabcakes ($16) and ravioli ($15) come 2 and 3 pieces to a plate respectively, so plan accordingly or be forced into an accidental diet.  Service is as slow as Chad, even if your party is one of only two groups having lunch, which was the case when I was here earlier this week. If you're seated upstairs and your server goes downstairs, I hope you're not in a rush.  *Names have been changed to protect the innocent."}
{"text":"Nice wine bar.  The patio in back is really cool; its open-air with big trees.  Drinks aren't cheap, but you wouldn't expect them to be at a place like this.  We were in Toronto for 3 days and this was probably our favorite area, too.  Never tried the food."}
{"text":"Yup, I agree with the previous reviewer. Caren's is a chick place all right. Nice patio, dim lighting inside for dates or charming rendez-vous with candles flickering around all over. Plus the hostess/server is sweet and funny. Not as posh or stuck up as some of the other places in tony Yorkville.  This is a great place in Yorkville to unwind after a long week with two of the best things in life: cheese and wine!! Fantastic selection of cheeses from individual selections where you can build your own custom cheese platter with all the fixin's or set cheese platters according to different themes: canadian, italian, goat's etc. If you're into fondue, they have several different cheese ones (good to share with friends) and a chocolate one on a few nights of the week.   And another plus, they are located directly across from the Cumberland theatre so a good place to grab a bite before or after a movie."}
{"text":"The hidden back patio is a Yorkville gem. A must check out. While you're  there make sure you try the cheese fondue :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's my first choice when I'm in Yorkville and looking for somewhere to have a nice drink or dessert, or get a meal.   It's reasonably priced (for Yorkville) and it's something different.   I love the patio (but in front and in the back). The wooden panelling and furniture gives it a cozy feeling.   I've been here a few times for dinner. The staff is super friendly and recommended wine pairing for my meal that was always perfect.  Everyone on the menu looks amazing, but I have a hard time not choosing my absolute favourite dish, the Spicy Mac and Cheese (made with Corona). Amazing.   I've also been here once for brunch. I really like it because it's something different. And the atmosphere is classy, but not pretentious. I highly recommend the vanilla pancakes.  great for: small groups, couples, drinks, patio"}

{"text":"If you enjoy great service, timely production and happen to be Celiac. DON'T go to Caren's.  20 minutes to order water and wine. Wrong wine arrived another 15 min later. Ordered food with painstaking information about Gluten allergy. 1 1/2 hours later, wrong food with a bun.  A splash of free wine and the full bill and we were out of there.  Sadly disappointing!  A \"must do not go\"."}
{"text":"EPOISSES IS BOSS.  Caren's is a lovely spot after attending a Feature Presentation at The Cumberland or for a late-night snack. I've been for dinner as well, but the place is a wee bit understaffed for a truly blissful dining experience.  If you love unpasteurized, ripe and rare cheese, look no further than Caren's. They have it all. I particularly enjoy their vast array of accompaniments you can order with your cheese. The staff know their stuff and are great at steering your charcuterie board. Bring a friend or date and get your Cheese On!"}
{"text":"I have been to Carens a couple of times and i enjoyed tge atmosphere and the delicious food. The service was always great.  The Tuna Rothschild appetizer is delicious along with a side of Guyere cheese plate.  On my first visit, I ordered the Risotto and my friend ordered the Mac & Cheese. When both entrees arrived, I had a taste of the Mac & Cheese, and it was sooo delicious. I must say the best for me. However, my Risotto was too salty that I had to ask the server to also get me a Mac & Cheese instead.  I was so happy. Cheesy and a little spicy which was perfect. The Entree size was big enough for 2 so opt for the side portion. On our second visit, my friend wanted to order The Stinton Burger but it was sold out that evening. Must be popular. Hoping to try that next. They also have great wine selections. We had the Cote Du Rhone.. delicious! Great summer dining venue. A little on the pricey side but it is Yorkville."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place one late Toronto night after typing \"wine\" into Yelp and realizing that this place was right nearby.  The atmosphere was inviting and chill, and I sat down at the bar and was lead down the Canadian-wine path by a friendly Mexican bartender, who recommended this and that and gave me tastes and samples.  It's hard if not impossible to get Canadian wines (that aren't dessert wines) in the US - Just like wines from Switzerland, I suppose most is not exported.  I had a fresh 2008 Blue Mountain Pinot Gris from BC with some Canadian cheeses that were yummy - Niagara gold and Blue benedictin from Quebec.  I also had a tasty Malivoire pinot noir with some light salumi.  While I liked the place very much, and the quality was good, I found it overpriced, unfortunately, at least compared to what I'm used to spending for typical fare elsewhere.  Maybe it's because I'm an out-of-towner and don't know Toronto well, but I would recommend this only if you're in the mood to splurge."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Carens on a random Thursday after our original dinner plans fell through. We didn't have a reservation, but were quickly seated. We shared the cheese fondue and the dessert fondue. My co-eater had a burger and I had a salad.   The food was good, but the fondue could have used more for dipping. Both the fondues are served over a tiny candle, which is really just for aesthetics and doesn't keep the cheese or chocolate melted.   Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, but he went on a break right when we had ordered drinks and no one else checked on our table while he walked out the door to get a sandwich. Perhaps Carens should give the servers a meal when they are working so they aren't forced to leave their customers unattended."}
{"text":"New kitchen staff! New menu! Must try the crispy rice cake and tuna and the confit chicken leg stuffed with chorizo and corn. Yum yum yum! Great place to enjoy a glass of wine and now great food too! I do agree with everyone.. total chick place or romantic date place."}
{"text":"I went to Caren's wanting to try the back patio that everyone suggested, but it had rained the day I went and the back patio was closed because it was wet.  Too bad. I guess I'll just have to go back!  What a pleasant surprise Caren's was!  A warm, friendly vibe with great service.  Our server was happy to recommend.  And I love that we could taste before deciding on a 1/2 litre or bottle (we actually did make a switch after tasting).  The food was also very good.    Prices were a little steep, but I guess this is Yorkville so it's to be expected.    Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Far too expensive for what's provided.  A friend treated me here for a birthday dinner quite recently....a gesture I really appreciate given just how expensive this place is.  The FOOD: We both had the steak frites.  The fries were incredibly well done and were quite complimented by the bacon aioli.  The salad had a nice mustardy vinaigrette.  The steak, however, was NOT cooked to order.  Medium rare, by any definition requires a pretty substantial amount of pink...red even.  The definition from The Keg (which knows how to cook a steak): \"Medium rare: Warm centre, red throughout.\"   We instead received a steak with mostly a grey centre and a small trace of pink in the thickest part...that would be Medium Well to Well Done.  My fundamental point is that at $27 for steak frites, you had better cook your steak properly.   My friend also found some parts so full of gristle that he had to spit them out.  Yikes!  The WINE:  They have a great selection by the bottle and by the glass.  They also offer things by the 1/2 litre, although it's not advertised.  Pretty expensive.  The SERVICE:  Our server was rather cold and awkward throughout the evening.  I knew from her response of \"tap, please\" to her question of \"still and sparkling\" that we were in for trouble.  The barely suppressed frown was noticeable.  Specials were quoted without prices...a pet peeve of mine.   No joy was shown in serving us.  Water glasses were refilled, but not much else.    OVERALL, given what I've seen from the steak and the service, I have little to say to recommend Carens.  Had it not been someone treating me for my birthday, I certainly would have complained about the steak.  Maybe come for a glass of wine and some cheese and call it quits."}
{"text":"Yeah..................... I definitely enjoyed myself at Carens. Hahahaha.  My friends from out-of-town and I were traipsing around Yorkville on a sunny afternoon. Us California kids love us some wine, so Carens was naturally the place to be. (Ciao looked ridiculously busy anyway)  There were a few people sitting in the front patio when we arrived. We expected to sit out there, but the server led us to the back patio. And it was gorgeous. Wonderful natural tree canopies. Lanterns strung up high. Tiny lights. Bright pillows on cushioned benches. and Fans!! Yes!! A/C. It was perfect. It was a surprise.  After going through a bottle of wine recommended to us by our awesome waiter (white, french, Chabli) and a swiss, gruyere, garlic, fondue w/ green apples and bread, we opted to stay for dinner.  We ordered their spicy mac and cheese and their stilton burger w/ cheesy potatoes on the side, and split it three ways. For wine, we went red this time and again we followed the waiter's recommendation -- a wine that wasn't even listed on the menu -- a wine that was actually one of our faves from back home -- a wine by the name of Raven's Wood, get it, it's awesome. The food was delicious. Completely devour-worthy.  And in my final attempts to add something Canadian into the meal, we ordered an Ice Wine (Gewurztraminer, not Riesling) and sorbet for dessert. We weren't expecting the sorbet to be so amazingly refreshing -- we were just expecting a little refreshment given the heat, humidity, and gluttony of the past 24 hours. It certainly hit the spot. It was actually a trio. Perfect for our party of 3. The sorbets were paired with fresh fruit, too. Mango sorbet w/ a strawberry. Strawberry sorbet w/ green apple. Raspberry sorbet w/ cantaloupe. The flavor was strong. The sorbet was smooth. Mango was the winner in my eyes.  After spending so much time lounging out on the back patio w/ A/C, shade, wine, cheese, meat, and fruits... we headed over to Starbucks down the street for a pick me up... yeah, we were feelin gooooooood.  I totally recommend Carens. Maybe we were lucky with the service since it wasn't too busy, but the folks there can be light and fun and they know their wine. Bottles are a little pricey, but that's just what you get for coming out to Yorkville."}
{"text":"Went here on an off night. There was some private party upstairs so we just sat in the small first floor area.  We ordered the cheese fondue. It was a blend of various cheese (mostly conventional - swiss was the main one). We asked for a wine pairing and were recommended a cotes du rhone. The wine was nice and smooth. I would say the fondue was decent but far from mind-blowing. The bread they served it with was stale. Really stale.  This place is too expensive for what it is. You're mainly paying for the yorkville location. But I expected that, so not sure why i'm complaining.  Anyway, I probably won't bother returning."}
{"text":"Have been here twice for brunch and it is a real Yorkville find -- great ambiance, excellent food, good service, and surprisingly affordable especially for the area. Look for the yellow sign across from the Cumberland Theatres... It's easy to miss.  The first time I came here, I ate inside. The decor is simple and elegant. But if the weather cooperates, ask for a seat on the spacious and airy back patio. There is tons of seating with wooden benches, bright cushy pillows, and chenille throws. White lanterns hang above you and it feels like a little garden oasis.  Our server was friendly and efficient, without the fake-ness that seems to plague many Yorkville joints.  They had a few specials (a chilled soup and an eggs benny), but I went with the eggs white veggie omelette with hash browns. It was light and very tasty!  Would love to come back on a summer night to sit under the stars on the patio, enjoying some wine and cheese!"}
{"text":"Randomly walked in there with my friend for a girls night out. Immediately fell in love with their outdoor patio. It's absolutely gorgeous! Inside it was also nicely decorated to create an upscale vintage vibe. Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable!  We ordered 2008 Italian Chianti, which we complimented with a cheese platter. Afterwards we ordered ice wine and chocolate fondue. Fondue was served with cookies, applies, marshmallows, and strawberries and was absolutely yum!  It is on the pricey side, which is not surprising since it is in the heart of Yorkville, however, paying $8 for a water bottle I found outrageous.  Everything else is absolutely great, and I will certainly visit again!"}
{"text":"I was invited to a blogger night at Carens Wine and Cheese Bar  on Wednesday evening.  First up was goat cheese, almonds, apricots and bread.  I'm not a fan of goat cheese but Gord said it was good.  Matt took care of us (he's been with Carens for eight years).  He explained the wines as they paired with the food..  Next was Tuna Rothschild.  This was Gord's favourite course (I didn't have any as I don't like tuna so he had mine).  Next was French Onion Soup.  I've never had it before and it was good.  Then came the Mac and Cheese.  I only tried the prosciutto one (not a fan of lobster or truffles) and it was my favourite course of the night.  Gord's favourite   The fondue came next (Swiss and gruyere fondue with apples and pear and Brie and blue cheese fondue with figs and walnut bread) ... I've never fondued before.  The Swiss and gruyere was the favourite of our table.  The last course was dessert (raspberry ice cream and a panacotta) and it was delicious!  When we were leaving, we were given gift bags with a Carens wine glass, a wine bottle opener and some smoked cheese.  Thanks!  The food and wine were good and it was a fun opportunity to check out this restaurant as I've never been before."}
{"text":"an inviting menu tempted us for dinner on may 23, 2013.  After an opportunity to look at the menu and the wine list we ordered.  Of the 4 entrees on the menu 1 was already \"out\" so we selected others.  The appetizer arrived after a 40 minute wait with little sign of our server.  My wife ordered the baked brie which turned out to be mushrooms and a hint of brie.  We are still looking for it on the plate.  The steak main which took another 30 minutes to arrive  was good but the breast of duck should have been described as the sawdust of duck.  Gristle and chewy to the point of being inedible.  Of course there were only 2 other options for a replacement meal by then and rather than wait another 30 minutes we cut our losses and left.  During the long waits there was no bread or other side item put on the table  Oh, the wine from the wine list we choose was \"not available\" but a suitable substitute was on hand.  Overall a place to be avoided"}
{"text":"Whoa. Service is absurdly slow here for large groups. Soooo slooowww that it makes a snail look like Usain Bolt. Granted we were a group of 8, but the kicker was that we waited for over an hour for them to bring out 2 ITTY BITTY APPS (and not even complicated apps - we got 2 warm Brie rounds). Isn't the point of appetizers to have a slight nosh to tide you over while your mains arrive?   Anyways, FAIL Carens, super super fail - In the time that we waited for the Brie, 2 of us got Hangry (a wonderful mix of symptoms caused by low blood sugar that turns you into an emotional monster that is always a minute away from banging the table like a heathen and demanding \"WHERE IS MY FOOD. BRING ME MY FOOD. ME WANT FOOOODD.\") And I 100% had stomach grumbles as we waited for the Brie, which has never ever happened to me in a restaurant. THE HUMANITY. Anyways, we finally all got our share of brie and scarfed it down like animals (cute animals always, like baby red pandas). About 10 minutes later our mains arrived, but not that the same time, the server only carried 2 plates each trip she made up the stairs. The wait in between the deliveries wasn't anything absurd, BUT, after waiting for an hour and a half for food, it would have made sense to use a second server for all of 2 minutes to have everyone served at around approximately the same time. BUT WHATEVER, this is ~French Dining~ so obviously, in order to cultivate ~chic-ness~ and a ~relaxed atmosphere~ food comes when the CHEF thinks it ought to come (which feels like NEVER).   I'm kidding. I love the French. Do whatever you want to me as long as its drenched in butter and pork fat.  One of our diners ordered her steak sandwich medium and it came well done, her meal was comped thankfully.  The servers weren't rude or sassy perse, but if the service was faster, it would have put the experience over the top because my baked mac and cheese was TO DIE FOR. It was a ginormous portion, the roux was a touch on the watery side, but the flavor was magnifique. I also had them add some Chorizo in there which set flavor blasters to level ELEVEN. All around, the dish had a nice subtle kick to it and I basically wanted to smash my face into the bowl like a lil' piggy like Randy from a Christmas Story.  Love the food, hate the service :("}
{"text":"VIBE Sophisticated. Small. Subdued.  This is a great place to chat with friends. I'll be coming back for the patio in the summer! Apparently, it's being renovated.   WE DRANK  Wine. It's a wine bar. Service wise, didn't really get any great suggestions but we didn't ask either. This is a place where you have to ask. I had a rose - for $12, it was OK.  Cheese platters seem overpriced for what they are but I was here more for ambiance than anything else.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Why do they spell Caren's with a C? Things that make you go Hmm."}
{"text":"I was only just introduced to Caren's this past summer and have gone three times since. They have a cozy patio out back and a small one out front.   They have a small menu and everything looks good. The Mac and cheese is to die for. I opt for the gluten free version and have added lobster for additional decadence. I tell myself I'll eat half and take the rest with me and the next thing I know I have eaten the whole thing.   They are incredibly accommodating for gluten free needs and adapt wherever they can. The eggs Benedict on tomato (instead of the English muffin) is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious food in a nice atmosphere (except when they get carried away with the romantic mood lighting and you find yourself eating in the dark almost). I like the outdoor summer back patio more than indoors. The food was delicious. The wine I tried was so so. I didn't love the recommendation (which I sampled), and I thought I'd try a wine I liked before but was a bit disappointed. I like it when restaurants find yummy wines and only put those on the menu, and not make you pick through a crappy menu to find a good wine. I want to order the house wine and have it be delicious, which was the case at some restaurants (though rarely). I'm sure it wasn't the case here, and I was looking at the mid-range to higher priced wines.  We had the Yorkville cheese plate after our meal, which was a bit disappointing. The Brie de Maux tasted a bit off. You could tell it's been in the fridge for a while because not only were the outsides dried out, but having sensitive tastebuds I was able to taste fridge. The blue cheese was delicious.   I know that when I previously went I had a better cheese experience so I don't know what's going on here.  As for mains, the duck was extremely delicious. The pesto shrimp tagliatelli or whatevs was quite good. The risotto with truffle oil was amazing. Overall, actual food is delicious.  They do food and cocktails well here, no debating that, but given that they are a wine and cheese bar I expected more in the wine and cheese department.  Super yummy, and I'd definitely recommend it as a nice summer patio when the weather is warm."}
{"text":"Carens has a nice atmosphere compared to the other cheese so easily found in Yorkville.  It's nice to be tucked away from all the posers.  Food is good service for dinner was poor but I am sure to be back."}
{"text":"This place has a nice patio, hidden in the back, creating an intimate atmosphere. The food is pricey and nothing spectacular. It's good, don't get me wrong, but I suppose you pay the Yorkville tax when you go there. I'd probably be back there in the summer for brunch. I'm not sure if this would be my go-to place for dinner though, unless I'm looking to have some cocktails. What I was impressed with is their music. My favourite lounge tunes, which I thought only resided on my iPhone, blissfully soothed my ear, while dimly lit Moroccan lanterns illuminated the patio."}
{"text":"Had lunch on the beautiful back patio here. Decor/ambiance back here is 5*, it's very beautiful plus it's covered in case of rain.  The interior is less impressive.  The lunch prices are reasonable (most entrees in the $15 range). Food is good but nothing unique or outstanding. Basic offerings, some pastas, sandwiches and salads. I had the tuna nicoise ($16) which was pretty nice, and healthy. Coworkers had the lamb burger, the mac & cheese, chicken penne and a chicken sandwich of some sort. The food is good just honestly - nothing special.  Service was friendly and efficient. Food took a smidgen too long but that's just me nit-picking. The dinner prices were higher so I can't really recommend it for a dinner spot - there are other places nearby with more interesting food."}
{"text":"If I would have know better...... I would not have order that Canadian Cheese Platter ($36) to share with my Yelp Drinking Buddy at Carens Wine and Cheese Bar!  No way the 2 of us can finish that  and have room for a 3 course dinner later in the evening.....  It was a nice warm summer evening... sipping some white wine in the front patio and people/car watching in Yorkville was enjoyable!  I have yet try the food from the kitchen yet... or that amazing BACK Patio! I guess I have to be back?!  But no lunch specials? Just the same pricing but with less item selections?! How disappointing... but Carens is located  in Yorkville after all...  Oh Wait!! Happy Hour Specials with $1 an oyster.... that's sounded more like my kind of place!! Oysters!! Anyone?!"}
{"text":"Hummm where should I start?!?! This place was DISASTROUS when it came to overall service and atmosphere. I was meeting a friend here for lunch and I happened to be the first one to arrive. I proceeded to ask for a table.. the server than asked to take my coat and when i agreed, he seemed annoyed. The server was definitely not in a welcoming mood. I then made a trip to the ladies room which was a huge flight of stairs upwards.. not very convenient to the clients on the first floor.  OK now on to service.. when the waiter came to the table to let us know the specials of the day he read them off of a scrap piece of paper.. did not make eye contact and did not look confident in selling the restaurant or the product. My friend began his order with the Lobster Bisque at which the waiter than interrupted to inform us that they did not have anymore, he said if we were there the next day we could have ordered it.. I found this OUTRAGEOUS!! How do you run a business with out products on the menu!! We both decided to then order the Chicken Linguine. Thank goodness for the cook because this dish was not only tasty but the right amount and we both enjoyed it. When we were finished our meal the waiter then asked us if we wanted dessert. When we declined he brought the bill right away. We didn't pay the bill right away because we were still talking and catching up one would say. He wouldn't stop  returning to the table to follow up every few minutes. As my friend paid the bill the waiter brought my jacket which i found EXTREMELY RUDE considering i didn't ask for it and it was his way of telling us to get out.. I would understand if we were the only ones in the restaurant and they needed to change over for dinner service but there was another couple who had just placed their order when this happened.  The places atmosphere looked nothing like the photos on the internet. Small and not very pleasant looking.  I will not be making my way back here even if someone personally asked."}
{"text":"So I have been here Twice.  Both on first dates. [Maybe I should switch that up].  Either way. Both times, this has been a good Date Place. Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Good selection of wine. A bit fancy, but not obscene. [obscenely nice...]  What I don't like about this place. It's missing something from being just that next step nice. the staff are friendly, but not loving it there [ so it seems]. Their fondue is sad. The pot is delivered with a little tea light under it. WHAT IS A TEA LIGHT GOING TO HELP KEEP BOILING. Such a fail.  Apparently their Mac and Cheese is supposed to be delicious, but I have never had a chance to try them [Thanks first dates girls who didn't part-take].  Anywhoo. I have had their Muscles and Oysters and i don't know a good one from a bad one, so i will say they were okay.  Hit this place up for a date. A cheese plate. Their infamous Mac and Cheese which I have not had, or for some wine. Either way, not out of your way expense, and the atmosphere matches."}
