{"text":"We were initially drawn to this restaurant due to the fact that it is the only place with frozen margs in all of Madison. When we arrived with our group of eight, we were told that it would be about a thirty minute wait. We ended up waiting over an hour, but the staff was kind enough to give us a round of drinks and appetizers on the house. The menu provided a variety of options for all preferences or dietary restrictions. Great place to visit with the family or on date night. Would definitely recommend getting there before the dinner rush!"}
{"text":"Food=4 stars Service=3 stars Atmosphere=3.5 stars (too dark) Salsa bar=5 stars!  Let's get to the good stuff...the specialty tacos! I had the Roasted Sweet Potato taco in a flour tortilla. The chard and sweet potatoes were a great combination. All it needed was a little salsa verde to kick up the taste. Miss Saigon Chicken taco had a combination of zesty and sweet flavors that needed nothing else. The El Pastor and Pineapple taco was a little disappointing. There were only 5-6 bite-sized bits of pork in there and many of them were quite fatty cuts of meat. That taco was the only thing on my plate I didn't finish.  I loved the self-serve salsa bar. Their mild salsa was amazing! The tomatoes were bright red, with onions and cilantro and just the right amount of salt.   I would definitely go back, and maybe try sitting in the bar section for faster service.  The atmosphere in the dining room was okay...it was a little dark in there for the time of day. But there were lots of interesting wall decorations like tin tiles, colored lights, and a wall of shiny hubcaps. If they had turned on more of the ambient lighting the place would have seemed a little friendlier."}
{"text":"We do enjoy Tex Tubbs Taco Palace. Ambiance is kind of cool. The ingress and egress at the entrance is unwieldy. When it's packed, there's no room to get to the restrooms or to the salsa bar, or even around the bar. There's no place for waiting people, to wait. On a Friday night after 6 p.m., we were seated right away. After we arrived, it got really packed. For an appetizer, we got the chips and guacamole. It was $6.99, which seemed pricey to me. But it was delicious. Salsa \"bar\" has only 4 salsas, and is hard to maneuver when there's more than one person at it. Salsa containers are tiny, so you have to negotiate the crowd to get back to it, and hope you don't spill your salsa on the way back to your table. \"Flight\" of 3 frozen margaritas for $7 is a bargain and very delicous. Hit the spot! I had the crispy Tilapia tacos, and my partner had the Green Chicken Chili. Both were delicious, but both of us thought they were dry. I had to put a lot of salsa on mine to make it not so dry. Otherwise, it was awesome. Our server, Jennifer, was a delight. She does the baking, and that particular day was National Mango Day, so she had baked Mango Margarita Cupcakes. We took one home, and my partner devoured it. It was awesome. Cupcakes were $3 a piece. It took a long time to get our food, but I attributed that to how busy it was. And we were happy eating chips and guacamole from our window seats. We had planned to use a gift card, and Jennifer kindly added chips and salsa to our take-out order so we got to our gift card total (can't use that particular gift cert to include with the tip). All in all, a great experience. Only downside was the dryness of the entrees."}
{"text":"The old Tex Tubb's was alright, but the new Ranch (is it Cadillac or Cactus?)  is amazing. Delicious, fresh BBQ that is far and away the best in town. I risked my fingers to try some of my friend's fish tacos (don't remember which kind) and they were so yummy with a tangy slaw. They did charge for chips...but at least they were fresh with homemade salsa. And our waitress kept them coming. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! They give you a great group of out of the box tacos to choose from and have great sides as well. The guy that seated me said that they were just recently voted best tacos in Wisconsi"}
{"text":"Two caveats: 1, it is amazing and baffling that the near east side has no real mexican food, and 2, I get that people like margaritas, and that a kid-friendly restaurant (where the parents can drink said margaritas) is bound to have a built-in clientele.  That said, how the hell does this place stay in business?   I ate dinner there about a month ago, and the generally shabby quality of the food amazed me. The taco meats were dry and saturated with sugar (something I've noticed at other FF restaurants too), the tortillas were verging on stale, and the salsa bar, while always a good sign, contained exactly one edible salsa.   Trying to stuff some calories in the ol' pie hole and get back to work, I doused my tacos in green Tabasco from the bottle on the table.  Problem? It was horribly rancid, and the waiter I informed of this apparently didn't know that hot sauce can go rancid. I literally threw 3/4 of my meal in the trash can.   Maybe they should spend less on their kitschy decor and more on the food. If you want Americanized Tex-Mex, go to Pasquals or Burrito D. If you want actual Mexican food, go to the south side."}
{"text":"Every bite was Amazing. Queso, Guac, Corn Tortilla Chips, Brussel Sprouts Taco, Fried Avocado, the quality and flavor of the steak in the burrito, the very flavorful Charro beans (takes me back to The Love Boat), margaritas...and so many flavors of tacos I want to try the next time we drive through such as the Southern Fried Chicken, Chicken Verde....wish there was one in our hood."}
{"text":"Get the fish tacos! Guac is an excellent starter, and pair it w/ a frozen margarita. Ta da! your night is made!  I used to live in Madison, so every time i come home for a visit, i make sure to stop by.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Yum!   I went here for lunch with friends and had a great fish taco and yummy enchiladas.  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"We used to really like Tubb's. We've been going there since opening night. We went back last night for the first time in a few months and were very disappointed. They changed the chips to a tasteless brand that is evidently cheaper. You can get better chips in any grocery store.   Even the salsa in the salsa bar seemed inferior to what it used to be. They had the same 4 salsas they have always had but they just didn't taste as good.  For our tacos we tried the crispy tilapia which wasn't crispy and had kind of a musty flavor. The blackened tilapia was a little fishy and only fair. Tubs used to wrap the tacos in two tortillas and they have cut back to one. The tortilla fell apart and we had to use a fork to eat it.  The grilled portabella mushroom taco is one I would order again. There was plenty of mushroom and the goat cheese added a nice flavor.  I'm in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Tex Tubb's Taco Palace is back!!!  It's been a long road, but Tex Tubb's Taco Palace is finally back on firm footing.  My wife and I were one of the first customers through the door on opening day several years ago.  We instantly loved it and became regulars, usually visiting 2 or 3 times a month for the first couple of years.    After the first couple of fantastic years the food quality started to waver.  You could always tell when a management change was made every 6 months or so.  The menu would slightly change, food quality would suddenly drop, and most of the employees would disappear.  The food quality would slowly rise back to normal over the next few weeks.  Then, about two years ago the cycle repeated itself, but in a far worse way.  All of the staff was fired, the menu was extensively changed, and ingredients of much lower quality were used.  The accountants were now in charge of the kitchen (apparently) and they were driving the restaurant into the ditch.  After 6-9 months, old Tex Tubb's still hadn't rebounded.  I thought the place would never recover.  Then, some time in 2012 things turned around.  The staff seemed to stabilize, good ingredients came back, the resaurant was full of customers again, and the food tasted good!  I was nervous that this was an aberration. But the positive trend has stayed in place for most of a year.  This is such a relief.  I've loved the food at Tex Tubb's Taco Palace.  The current fare from the kitchen is maybe 90% as good as it was during the first couple of years.  The frozen margaritas are just as good as always.  The salsa bar is one of the few constants -- it's always been excellent, even when the restaurant has suffered from other woes.  And my new favorite is the Palace Margarita.  It's one of the best I've ever had.  Get it during happy hour for only $5 and you're in for a treat!  I've wanted to write a review of Tex Tubb's Taco Palace for a few years.  I'm glad I waited until it finally returned to good form."}
{"text":"What we ordered:  - 1 fried avocado taco, 2 chicken tacos   - chips and salsa  What we thought:   First, we didn't realize that the tacos came with default flour tortillas until too late.  We prefer corn and naively assumed that all tacos are served on corn tortillas.  I don't know why I assumed this.  Maybe because I've been eating tacos all my life and I've never been served a taco on a flour tortilla except at taco bell?  Nah, couldn't be that.    They came really done up:  tomatos, sour cream, cheese, cabbage, carrots.  Very fancy.  Also very big.  I'm sure two would be enough for dinner.  We each ate one.  She said the fried avocado was gross, and that it was a great way to ruin avocado.  I thought the chicken sucked.  It was just boiled white meat.  Aren't you supposed to grill it a bit, or something?    We would skip these if we came back and try something else.    Also, tacos came with beans and rice.  They did this up a bit too, so the rice had like spices and veggies in it.  She didn't think it was an improvement on rice.  I liked it.  The beans had an off flavor, and were dry and too thick.  Looked like a lump off poo, to be honest.  And I don't like that kind of thing.  Chips and Salsa  Warning:  THEY CHARGE FOR CHIPS AND SALSA.  The nerve!  honestly."}
{"text":"Beef Brisket tacos w/ refried beans and rice. Tasted beans first. Greatly over salted. Rice. Tasted great but rice seemed a bit old. Tacos. Fatty Brisket bites that were seasoned beyond comprehension. The salsa serve idea is a bad one as it creates too much movement and its rather wasteful. Squeeze bottles with reusable metal ramekins would not only be sustainable but the customer could stay seated with friends thus less chaos. The waitress was a doll and went above and beyond taking the heat for lackluster cooking. Nice atmosphere. Great FOH staff. Fair prices if the food were taken up a notch."}
{"text":"After a long stretch of poor food and worse service, Tubb's is finally back in the hands of capable staff. There's a wide variety of tacos to try, and I've enjoyed all those I've had (El Pastor and Backyard BBQ are my favorites). I don't know if it's authentic Tex-Mex or Austin-style, and I don't really care. There isn't anyone else in town doing what they do, so this is my go-to for tacos."}
{"text":"A pretty untypical spot for this neighborhood, but very welcomed. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the flavors.  Clean restaurant with colorful \"Austin\" decor.  They slow cook their own beef and pork.  Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Heading there tomorrow with a band-mate for lunch.  Already anticipating which tacos I'll choose.  I may have reviewed this place already but I can't remember.  Because the neggy reviews are bugging me, I'll just write another one!  My wife and I typically go here mid-afternoon, post-lunch rush.  The atmosphere is more relaxed and less loud and hectic, but the service is always prompt, unlike a lot of places that ignore off-hour customers while they do their side work.  Because it's daytime, the place is flooded with light from the sky-light in the dining room, so I can't speak to it being \"dark and dingy.\"  I will say there are often two different sources of music, coming from both the bar and in the dining room, which can be a little disturbing until we ask them to turn it down a bit, which they always do without attitude.    And describing the outside as \"ghetto\" is truly strange to me.  It is an old brick business building, well-taken care of, with a bright, colorful sign for the restaurant in front.  If you entered in back, by the kitchen, yeah, it looks like the back of a restaurant.  Surprise, it looks dirty - they intend for you to come in the front entrance.  We go in through the back because it's right by the disabled parking spot for my wife, but I don't hold that against them.  If you enter any restaurant by the back entrance, it will be dirty and gross, or perhaps \"ghetto\" as someone has characterized it.  I will withhold comment on use of the term \"ghetto\" and what it may or may not say about the attitude of certain other reviewers here.  As far as servers and staff having piercings and colored hair: I know this kind of thing freaks some people out.  Apparently, it freaks some of them out to the point of calling the staff \"trolls.\"  I wouldn't describe the staff as \"trolls\" exactly, more like  'young alt East-Sider types\".  If that look is too weird for you, you might consider any one of the fine shopping-mall chain restaurants farther out of town.  Oh, and a lot of the BOH staff is from south of the border - just a friendly warning!  The food: we have been eating here since they opened (2006?  2007?) and we have NEVER had a meal that was anything short of pretty good.  Sometimes it's OK-good, other times it's SUPER-good, mostly it's pretty good food.  I will also say that it can be a bit pricey, which is why we mainly stick to the tacos.  We have had the fajitas a few times, which were quite good, and a chimichanga once, also tasty.  It is pricier than a cheapo taco stand, but you're getting a full-service restaurant, with an extensive bar, not a taco in a slip of paper that you have to shove down your throat while you dodge traffic crossing the street back to your office.    I will stipulate that they seemed to go through a bit of a rough period a couple-few years ago, and the food quality and choices did drop somewhat to our disappointment.  However, based on several visits last year and this, that issue was long-since resolved, and we enjoy their offerings as much as we did when they opened.  Also, I have seen a lot of reviewers ding them for not being \"authentic\".  First, they are a self-described \"Tex-Mex\" joint, as one might find in Austin Texas (the model they follow), not straight-up Mexican food.  Tex-Mex is its own thing, with a history and a legit place in the food universe.  Take them for what they are, not what you think they should have been.  Plus, no Mexican restaurant in the USA is really \"authentic\" because they all get adjusted to meet gringo tastes and requirements in some way.  Maybe a food truck might qualify, but then you should go track one of them down anyway.  Judging by the many owner-responses to bad reviews (one even offering a tasting!) it seems like they take their business and food seriously, and really care what people think of them.  I read a lot of yelp reviews, and I hardly see any other joint respond this much and so well to criticism.  Perhaps people happened to visit on a really bad off-night (it can happen) but give them credit for taking the time and care to look after their place so well.  By the way, the salsa bar IS great."}
{"text":"Service was great. Loved the atmosphere. Loves the vegan options. Had the vegan nachos. Was good but I would probably try something different next time."}
{"text":"Tex Tubbs has gone through some changes - in the back and front of the house, and on their menu. My GF and I have eaten here dozens of times, and continue to go, about once every 4-6 weeks.  Here's what works - Frito pie. Don't be shy. Order it. - Three kinds of salsa. - My favorite tacos are the Backyard BBQ and Southern Comfort. These are new to their \"Fancy Tacos\" lineup in the last year - Margaritas. They squeeze fresh limes for these, like their step-brother restaurant, El Dorado. Yum. - Jicama slaw. Another new'ish addition to the menu. Great side, and doesn't make you wish you'd worn an elastic waistband, like rice and beans do for me.  Here's what doesn't - Spotty service. That \"sit anywhere you want\" thing at the front door is still off-putting, even though I know that's the drill.  - When you do sit down, you may have two or three different people help you. I know this is better than having NO ONE come over to the table, but I frequently find myself saying, \"Someone already took our drink order.\" C'mon, I shouldn't have to direct traffic; I'm here for lunch!  Overall, Madison doesn't have many great Tex-Mex places, so Tubbs is the king of a small hill."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I had a miserable experience at Tex Tubb's tonight. I've eaten here before and have ordered and enjoyed the green chile chicken taco. Tonight I took one bite and spent the next 20 minutes in agony with my throat on fire. I had bitten into something extremely hot that should not have been in the taco. My sister ordered the same taco and hers was the typical mild taco I remembered when I ate it previously. I mentioned it to the waitperson who clearly thought it was just me and offered no remedy such as bringing a new taco or reducing my tab. Then upon leaving I discovered white sauce all over the sleeves and one side of my dark-colored down coat. I was sitting on my coat, but the sleeves and the sides of the coat were hanging over each side of my chair. Apparently, the wait staff had spilled large amounts of sauce onto my coat when clearing the table behind me. My coat is new and was not cheap and it now has large stains down the front and on both sleeves. Getting a new taco is the least of my worries; now I need a new coat. Not happy with Tex Tubb's tonight.  UPDATE 1/10/2016: I decided I should talk with the Manager about my experience. I called last night and was told Scott G., the General Manager, would call me back. He called later last night and again today and left very sincere messages apologizing and offering to pay to clean my coat. I called him back today and we had a good conversation. It's clear he genuinely wants customers to have a good experience, he was sorry about the experience we had, and he offered to do what he could to make up for the experience. I'm more than satisfied with his response and efforts and will give Tex Tubb's another try in the future."}
{"text":"The changes to this place within the past 2-3 years have been stark and not encouraging -- I believe they are currently managed by some folks who used to manage Monty's Blue Plate Diner, and while it's understandable that there are management changes over time, I can't help but wonder if this is why my experience there recently was so utterly mediocre.  Let's get down to the nitty gritty:  - A few years back, the variety of tacos was decent and interesting; daikon, achiote tilapia, salmon, etc.  Nowadays, it's down to the minimum and served up (in general) on awful store-bought flour tortillas.  The corn tortillas that were their staple seem to be a thing of the past for the most part.  - I decided to try the \"tequila shrimp\" taco, and it was a watery, runny mess.  \"Runny\" is never something you want for a taco.  - Their chips are now the cheapest imaginable, out-of-a-bag generic, cardboard-like chips.  Microwaved for a minute to give the false impression that they're actually made on site (to an idiot, perhaps).  I felt the enamel getting lost with every chip I ate.  - The service was pretty slow -- took us something like a half hour just to get an order of guacamole.  Sorry, were you waiting for the avocados to ripen or something?  When I lived down the street from Tex Tubbs, I gladly went in there once a week or more.  I've since moved away from this location and haven't been in it in quite a while -- I'm sad to see the charm and the modicum of authenticity in their food gone."}
{"text":"I went there not knowing if I would have \"Texas\" tacos. Yes they do and they have a nice variety of them. Started off with the guacomole . Generous size and very well seasoned. They serve you unlimited chips. You pick out your salsa at the salsa bar! Good selcetions for anyones taste. Red and green of course. I ordered the 3 taco plate with refried beans and rice. Other options are available. The surprise came when our waitress asked if I wanted all 3 Pork or did I want to mix and match! I said sure. You can have one of each variety offered. Now YOU know! I could have sworn our waitress was from the Great State but she said no. Must be something she picked up in working for Tubb's. My friend asked if they had Lone Star beer. She said sure! Will wonders never cease. The taco's came out on fluffy shells, Fresh and tasty. No room for dessert. The meal was satisfying and inexpensive. Try them out! Johnny Chitown"}
{"text":"Gritty, noisy, crowded. \"Medium\" salsa gives you the sweats. No need for seconds because the portions require plates with re-bar. Tubbs has everything Tex-mex embraces of which  most Madison millenials are clueless.  The food and atmosphere is what  Southwestern is about, and if you're after Mexican go have your diatribe elswhere.   Food is fresh, fast and hot. I love the salsa bar, salsa is not something that should be begged nor wasted. Kudos.  Prices are fair, not cheap but fair as they should be. Excellent libations."}
{"text":"Tex Tubb's is Madison's latest, but let's face it, not greatest taco establishment.  The decor is classic southwest Texas styling, and enjoyable in itself.  They offer the choice of four different salsas in their \"salsa bar,\" but, unlike most similar restaurants, don't provide bottomless free chips to go with.  Overall, the food was quite good, but the price was not.  I paid over 30 dollars for dinner for two including one beer a piece.  Not what one wants at a taco stand.  The wait was also too long, but that could have been the fact that I went within the first two weeks of it opening."}
{"text":"I went once and wasn't impressed.  I tried it again and it didn't fare any better."}
{"text":"I must say I was disappointed. Salsa bar had been so hyped up and was just 4 salsas not sure what people were raving about. The mild tasted terrible, like tomato paste. Couldn't tell the difference between the medium and hot but they were good; and then a salsa verde. Nothing extraordinary... Not even the best salsa in town. Food was good, not great. Would go back again as a good spot for a group, but not expecting any thing amazing from the food."}
{"text":"Chef Kevin Tubb's (of Eldorado Grill) from Austin and this place pays tribute to it.  Very casual and fresh food.  Their Fish tacos are amazing -- my favorites include the Blackened Tilapia, Shrimp, Portabella & Feta. And their Salsas are really good too!  For beverages, their limeades are tasty  For dessert, the Jalapeno key lime pie is yummy (with a kick!)"}
{"text":"I had fun here. I am not sure how authentic the food is but it tasted good. The margaritas were good too. This restaurant also donates to schools for community events so I think supporting them is a nice idea."}
{"text":"New in town, this place looked fun and I love tacos and ritas so... duh, I went in. I've actually been in twice now. The salsa bar is a nice touch, the tacos are pretty good, but the Margaritas were horrible. I'm pretty easy to please in this area, but they were BAD. The staff was nice and attentive, but all in all, it's just ok."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular and had always been pleased with the tasty food and affordable prices. I've always ordered the same thing: chips and guac, mushroom tacos with rice and beans, and house margaritas on the rocks--these items have been consistently delicious up until the last couple of  times I've visited. After a brief hiatus I returned for lunch one day and learned that they had started defaulting to flour tortillas for the tacos instead of corn, which I thought was a big down grade. Last weekend I went for dinner, and I was really disappointed to get flour tortillas again even after specifically asking for corn. The tacos are not nearly as good now. Also, the chips, which used to be free, seem to be getting more and more expensive. I know that these are tough economic times, but come on--$2 for a tiny basket of chips? This past weekend we were charged for two servings of chips even though we only got one basket. Maybe they automatically charge by the number of people in the party? Or it could have been a mistake, I didn't check.   Anyway, I'm sure I'll still visit on occasion, but I'm disappointed in the flour tortilla policy and the chip situation. Margaritas are still good, at least. :)"}
{"text":"Used to be much better, but T Tubbs has declined significantly recently. Not sure why. Staff remains quite good and friendly, but the food quality has suffered."}
{"text":"I dig Tex Tubb's.  Lots of veggie friendly and meat eater options. They are also my fave margarita place. The queso and guacamole are awesome. I also really love the crispy beef tacos. Staff is pretty rad and do is the atmosphere.  They recently started doing s pretty yummy brunch too!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant! My husband and I eat here at least once or twice a week. Get the ultimate margarita, nachos, and black bean and corn flautas. So good! Great fast service, good atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"We came to try the steak fajitas and though they were excellent. Being from the no pain no gain school of thought we picked the hottest salsa as our favorite--the mild had virtually no heat.  Service was fast and the staff was very friendly. We'll definitely come again."}
{"text":"Lunch at Tex Tubbs was a treat!   Service was warm and attentive, food was tasty and generous in portion, and the atmosphere was casual but inviting.   The fajitas came out sizzling-hot, and were flavorful with just the right kick. I'd definitely recommend them!   A huge thanks to Jessalyn, my server, for a fantastic experience.   5 stars to y'all, thanks for the great afternoon break."}
{"text":"Terrible. Waited a long time for food.  Had to send food back. When it came back a tamale was FROZEN in the middle.  Under seasoned meat, and never even received a visit from the manager.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Nachos. I only get the nachos. I don't try anything but the nachos. The nachos are good. The nachos are sooo good!   In other related feedback, the staff is what pushed it up to the 5 star mark. I never cared to go back when I first tried the Tex Tubb's 3 years ago. But tried it once more on a family suggestion and it is now in my top 5 of Madison and am a monthly regular. I should note that Mexian food is my comfort food--a strange thing for a Gringo who grew up 1500 miles from the border. Now this is mostly Mexican and tex-mex inspired food and may not meet the note of some purists but it does all the essentials very well. The salsa and guacamole is good. The pork is fantastic! To clarify I get both the guac and pork on the nachos and would strongly suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"I like the reasonably priced, reliable and tasty black bean burrito (the \"Wilmar\") with its fresh avocado inside.  Too much noise and hubbub though to eat it there during the rush- better as take out."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we never made it to the food, let alone drinks.  We stopped by Tex Tubbs for a quick drink around 11:15 this morning while waiting for Alchemy to open (we were going there for lunch). We were the only 3 in the joint and were told by the 3 staff members chatting at the bar to take a seat wherever. The bartender stopped by our table and we told him we told him the 3 draft beers we had chosen.  5-7 minutes later, the guy was still fiddling around behind the bar doing random stuff other than pouring us our beer. We were seated about 15 ft from the bar, so it was clear to see he had no intention of making his way towards pouring us beer in the next few minutes. We were very confused. The other two staff members were still chatting at the bar.  We decided to just get up and wait outside Alchemy after watching no progress after about 10 minutes. We asked the two girls chatting \"Has he poured our beer yet?\" They turn around and look at the bar \"No, doesn't look like it.\" We were now more confused. We got up and made our way toward the exit and said \"Thanks, we're going to go somewhere else.\" To which they responded \"Sorry.\"  Tex Tubbs. Get it together or you won't make it, period."}
{"text":"i had absolutely no complaints with tex tubb's.  great food, super friendly staff.  not too expensive.  all around good experience and i will return."}
{"text":"Tex's is a go to for great Tex-Mex in Madison. I'm usually there for the fish tacos. They introduced them to Madison a few years back and do a great job The salsa bar is also a favorite. They are 'family friendly' so you can expect a fair amount of rug rats as dining companions, with the associated noise levels.  Overall, good food, good bar, higher energy space."}
{"text":"The pickled veggies are a highlight. The brisket torta I had was amazingly good-- the brisket was perfectly smoked, and there were all kinds of sweet and savory and fatty and salty flavors going on with chewy crunchy gooiness on very nice torta bread. I talked about it for like three days straight.  Sometimes, unfortunately, Tex Tubb's can be a little inconsistent-- we go pretty often, and it seesaws from being pretty good to really amazing. I don't know what the variables are, but they seem to have been able to lean closer to amazing over the past year or so, and I hope they can land there permanently.  They have brunch now, too! (Haven't tried it yet-- mean to, but keep forgetting)"}
{"text":"Food was horrible and tacos had absoluetly no flavor.  One person from the group ordered tamales and they were both frozen in the middle. The waitress did not tell the manager so they could verify that others, who ordered tamales, would not receive frozen food. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday for brunch with the man. We're regulars at Tex Tubb's and thought this was worth a try. Big mistake.   For at least the first 20 minutes we were the only people in the restaurant, but it still took the waitress 15 minutes to get us soda and water, which she then failed to refill for a good 30 minutes. Food arrived cold and was sent back. My chorizo burrito was good, but very low on actual chorizo. The man's pancakes were excellent. Tacos were bland and greasy.   Their menu looks like it's got potential, but for the higher prices I'd expect a waitress that's actually attentive and food that's well done. Sticking to Atwood from now on."}
{"text":"Yes, this place gets a 1 and I'll explain why I would give them an even worse rating if I could...  -WAY overpriced. I paid over 5 dollars for a fish taco that had less than 1/2 cup of filling. The piece of fish was like a fat minnow in size. Just wrong. I don't like to be ripped off this badly.  -The people there were rude to me and didn't take my to go order for like 10 minutes and they weren't even the slightest bit busy.  -I waited another 10 minutes for my mini taco before I got it.  I ended up eating in my car, feeling ripped, eating a taco that was a perfect portion for my small dog, but not a real human. And it wasn't even good food. Sad to say, but even taco bell beats this place."}
{"text":"I felt really ripped off. I paid almost 5$ for a taco that would have filled up my cat, but certainly not myself. It was not even the size of my hand and there was one mini tiny piece of fish in it. It didn't even taste that good either.  Definite skip their prices are outrageous. I prefer Chipotle for big burritos :)"}
{"text":"I've got to say, the enchiladas were good, the beans were good, but the rice left a little to be desired.   The banana tarimisu was good too!"}
{"text":"This place was a bit pricey - but the food was great and really fresh. Had the tacos plate and my wife had the enchiladas - we shared the salsa and chips over a busy Friday dinner hour this past summer.   Besides being busy with all the hipster traffic from the Atwood neighborhood, the waitstaff worked hard and provided pretty darn good service for the amount of people lined up, even outside. The seating area, while being loud, has a great ambience with nice windows that look out on Winnebago/Atwood.   The food was hot, delicious, and served pretty fast. The prices keep it a treat worth having once in awhile - but I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Food is good. Friendly staff. Plenty options for vegetarians. Parking is bit of a challenge specially in winter."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to this place a couple of times. The place itself looks great and is clean, the menu is really nice and the food looks fantastic. However, I'm giving it three stars because there is a serious lack of flavor in the tacos and the sides! They really need to be more generous with the spices or at least salt. I'm wondering if it's somekind of a healthy food thing since they have a lot of vegetarian options? Too bad because the food is bland."}
{"text":"Love Tex Tubb's...has been a favorite for years. Great vegetarian options and salsa bar.....great bartenders and margaritas! Unfortunately, we have noticed some changes in our favorite foods. Please make the sweet potato taco like you used to.....they were awesome until you changed the way you prepared the sweet potatoes. Other sad notes; Brussels sprouts are never done enough anymore, avocados aren't really \"fried\" any longer, and the blackened tilapia is gone. On a positive note, the new Ancho Carrot taco we tried was great! We'll keep our fingers crossed that our suggestions are noticed. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Tubb's catered for my wedding and it was flawless. Hello roasted sweet potato flautas! Why are you not on the regular menu?!?!  And every time I've been into the restaurant it's all on point. Salsa bar, margaritas, all of it."}
{"text":"We went on a date here tonight and were very pleased once again!  The bacon wrapped jalapeños were to die for! We got 5 tacos, 2apps, and a margarita and our total was only $40! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"YAY!  Delicious tacos and margaritas.  I was insanely impressed with the vegetarian options on the taco menu- not just beans, lettuce and tomatoes.  The vegetable tostada was by far my favorite and my carnivorous man loved the pork belly taco.  The jicama slaw was bomb too.  We both woke up the next day wanting more...."}
{"text":"Not the best fusion American-Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. I ordered three tacos and only the el pastor and pineapple was worth ordering again. The spicy margarita was good, the atmosphere was very relaxed, but the food itself was lacking."}
{"text":"My third time getting take-out from there and getting screwed on the guac I ordered. I called and spoke to the manager and was offered a free appetizer next time I came in. Nonsense... what incentive is that... to spend more money someplace that has already screwed me 3 times. The food s good... but there is better out there in this town that delivers and gets their orders correct every time. Thought I'd give them another chance and they BLEW it. How hard can it be to put a side of guac in a bag when you're not even busy? C'mon!?!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fantastic, i wish i would have taken a picture. The portion i got was huge but delicious. The only set back is the small spaces, our table was slightly wobbly and i was worried my chair would break, the seat was lose. Other than that i am totally coming back!!"}
{"text":"Tex Tubbs is awesome. They have a cool, Austin style vibe with friendly and fast service. They have a wide variety of menu items, catering well to the gluten free and vegan, though I'm neither. I had the backyard barbeque taco and the blackened tilapia taco, which came on soft corn tortillas, my favorite. Both were great. I love their house made chips. They also have an All Day happy hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays."}
{"text":"Everything was super delicious. Sweet potato fries are about the best I've had and the fried cauliflower taco was a wonderful culinary experience. Great options for vegetarians and carnivores alike. We will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"I would give it 4 stars if the West Side location had a salsa bar like the original East Side Tex Tubb's. The black bean soup is hearty and good for the thousands of cold winter days in Madison. Try every type of taco at least once. My favorites are the veggie and grilled mahi mahi. Saturday and Sunday breakfast burritos are good after a late night out."}
{"text":"5 W O R D S ...  \"99¢ Night Tacos on Monday\"  How can you go wrong?  Okay, if you're a vegetarian then you're SOL; but I digress...  Pretty much every Monday my teenager and I have dinner at my parents place. While taking a walk, I asked Ma dukes \"What the hell is this place?\"  My dad's like, \"Oh, girl, that's the Taco Palace.  Good stuff!\"  Alrighty...  I'll be the judge of that.  My Mother & I came in and I said how much for a Taco; my Mother and the lady were like 99 cents.  I said, \"come again?\"  99¢ a taco, for ground beef?  Give me 16 of them; carry-out please...  Anywhoooo; my mother, father, daughter and I enjoyed four tacos each at my parents house for cheap.  Flavorful, (I mixed my roja & salsa verde together) and the staff was friendly.  All in all a cool experience."}
{"text":"I felt the food was expensive for what it was w/ very small portions. That would have been accepted but the waitstaff was terribly rude. The food was average. I heard they took the photo booth out, so that looses some points, too."}
{"text":"I gave this location 4 stars because I have only ordered a few things there and they were excellent. The Tilapia Fish Tacos are a beautiful thing, I also had breakfast there last Saturday and had Chorizo eggs with black beans and rice. It was another excellent meal and very well priced! I love the east side location, it has great character! There is talk of redoing the menu, dont touch the fish tacos!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times in the past few months, both with my kids and without.  On Monday nights kids eat free (with purchase of adult meal), which is handy for families but if you want a kid-free night Monday may not be the night to go.  The service was consistently outstanding, even during a very busy lunch time.  The servers explained the salsa bar (loved the flavors) and brought drinks out right away.  On our last visit, my youngest daughter asked for \"just grapes\" as her side dish before I could stop her - fruit or fries are offered on the kids' menu.  Sure enough, a little dish with only grapes came out on her plate."}
{"text":"Cute little place with fun decor. Went for a late lunch on a Monday so it wasn't busy. Free chips and salsa with Yelp check-in was nice. Very friendly and prompt service. Tried the grilled shrimp tacos with sweet potato fries, would have been great except the shrimp was a bit too spicy. My sister loved the tempeh tacos and appreciated all the vegan options."}
{"text":"the food is always great. This is the place I bring out of town guests for something a little different but guaranteed to be delicious"}
{"text":"I've been passing by Tubbs for awhile and i finally bad a journey to go in. It was an amazing experience for me. From the drinks like the paradise margaritas to the endless chips and salsa. The entrée omg there so good I've been try a new one everytime I go.  In the theme of atmosphere it definitely feels like walking into a piece of Texas style dining. They also have the food to back it you. When you sit down your give a great greeting  and a basket of chips to snack on, make sure you stop by the salsa bar. I always get one of each.  This restaurant brings Atwood street alive. It's a must stop spot on the eastside of madison."}
{"text":"This place is very mediocre, and their pricing is reachy and irritating. The tacos were dry, flavorless, and fell apart as we ate them. The tortillas are dry and rip apart because they don't bother warming them at all. They charge $4 for a basket of chips to go with the free open salsa bar. Most Mexican/tex-mex places will give you free chips and salsa but Tex Tubbs shakes you down for $4 because they can. They also charge $4 each for their bland, fall apart tacos where you can get amazing taco down the street at Ohio Tavern for $3. If you are bringing kids, I guess this is an ok place, but if you just want a good taco, go to Ohio Tavern instead. I won't be wasting my money here again for a while."}
{"text":"I actually end up eating here quite often because it's convenient and I like the comfort food aspect of the place but their quality is really variable and they are never great. The meat, for instance, is sometimes well prepared but about every third time I'm there it's partially dried out in combination with having blobs of fat and gristle in it. The ingredients never seem to be all that fresh and a lot of times I find the tacos to be dry and to have an excess of one ingredient, like cabbage, that throws the whole dish off. I'm not really sure why they can't take it up a notch, but this kind of thing seems endemic to all the restaurants in the Food Fight conglomerate. They are always just kind of ok, often dealing decent comfort dishes but not really doing anything all that special or outstanding. So if you want a big pile of fatty American Tex-Mex food you can try it out. If you want a great"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Texas, and this is the closest things we've found to \"Tex-mex\" in the Midwest. Just wish the Rita's were a little more like home."}
{"text":"Great food and margaritas. All day happy hour Tuesdays and Thursdays. Right next to One Barrel Brewing also so that is a plus."}
{"text":"When I think about what a taco palace should be, this is it. Huge, delicious selection of tacos, a salsa bar and a pretty decent craft brew list.  The tacos are served on two thin white corn tortillas and topped so high it's hard to eat  with a fork or spilling all over yourself. I just ordered two tacos (without the sides) and was plenty full. This was a great stop before heading to One Barrel Brewing, which is two doors down."}
{"text":"There's so much to love at Tubb's! For starters, the salsa bar is incredible (I can never get enough of the medium salsa). The taco selection is impressive and almost always a sure-bet, though I would stay away from the House-Smoked Chicken taco, which I thought was a little dry. However, my favorite thing might be the Jicama Slaw (I wish I could get it as a side with more dishes). Everything is well-priced, especially during Happy Hour ($3 frozen margaritas!). It might not be as good as the best tex-mex you would get in Texas, but it sure is the best you'll find in the Midwest."}
{"text":"Returned after a long, well-deserved hiatus to find that the food has improved greatly. I had the chicken fajitas, and it was enough food for about three days, no kidding. The Mr. enjoyed his steak tacos, as well. Drinks are still ridiculously overpriced, but I'm finding it amazing how much of an impact switching to soda has on your overall bill, not just here, but everywhere."}
{"text":"Carnivores to vegans will be happy with the tasty choices here. The salsa bar is excellent. The salsa is not free like alot of Mexican places but it has 4 different kinds that are all delicious. It's only 2.50 $ and all you can eat. Plenty of different types of tacos and dishes. Me and my significant other have been here dozens of times. The staff is always helpful and food comes out in a Timely fashion. Sadly I have moved away from madison but every time I am back i make it a point to stop by.   No complaints. Give me that taco!"}
{"text":"We were really disappointed in this place. I am extremely easy to please when it comes to food, but the food at Tex Tubb's was bad. I also love dark beers and tried their stout - which is brewed with peppers - and it was undrinkable; I feel terrible about wasting anything and had never failed to finish a dark beer until this one.  The good things about the place were the atmosphere, the service, and the ginger beer (which was delicious despite not really tasting much like ginger).  Honestly, I don't understand why people like this place. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Their queso and chips are right up there with some of the best. The guacamole is pretty outstanding as well. Margaritas are delicious but pricey. I like the tacos, but they lack seasoning. I always find myself putting salt or hot sauce on them to elevate the flavor. That alone will not keep me away from this place. Check it out for something different!"}
{"text":"So although I've never actually set foot in the place, I've taken a gander at their menu and decided this place would be a complete let down, waste of time, and money --- and here's why:  You are charged for chips and salsa... complimentary at even at the holiest of hole in the wall mexican/tex-mex restaurants.  The tacos... $2.89 for a run of the mill taco in a FLOUR tortilla? Really? And the corn tortilla taco is a TOTAL bargain at $2.49. What a joke! In real, authentic mexican restaurants - like in Chicago, you could get 3 of the most fantastic steak or al pastor tacos for under $5.  That's pretty much all I needed to see to make my decision that I would never, ever go there. That, and if the quality of their other restaurants is any indication of Texas Tubb's... yeah, keep on walkin'!"}
{"text":"Like so many Food Fight restaurants, this one banks on decor instead of serving good food.   The salsa bar is comprised of multiple mild, lifeless salsas. I know the average customer probably whines about spicy food, but if you label a salsa \"hot,\" it should pack a punch.  It's hard to imagine how a place can also consistently produce dry tacos, but I've never gotten one at Tex Tubbs that wasn't dry.  In short, this is not the place to go for (Tex Mex) food. The margaritas are just fine and the place is cute enough if you want to meet friends for drinks and queso w/chips."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fun place. As you'd expect by the name, Tex Tubb's is decked out all Texasy. I like ordering a Shiner Bach on tap, they serve it extra cold! My favorites are the fish tacos and the flautas. I gave it 4 stars because even though they've got some tasty items on the menu, there's some pretty blah ones as well."}
{"text":"Great food fun atmosphere. Service can be a little slower sometimes. Great brunch lunch spot. Never been for dinner. Their salsas are the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I don't even want to talk about how loud it is and how bad the food was. The walls are shiny and change with the television, which is disorienting, there are children running and crying, the floor is wet and dirty.  The server stopped by....but only to bring us carryout materials and basically asking us to leave. Yikes.  I guess I could get drunk here though, it's pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Arrrrggg I have instant brain pain whenever I'm invited to Tex Tubb's.  I can't grasp the reality of this being one of the go-to places in Madison.  It's by far the worst of all the Food Fight establishments.  But it's also the perfect fit for Food Fight.  Tex Mex on a whole a very bland genre of food.  But cheap frozen margaritas don't entice me because I'm not a lush or a moron.  If I want tacos I'll go to a real Mexican place.  But my idea of dining isn't a poorly lit party type atmosphere.  I'm not loud and obnoxious and I don't slam shots in between the bites of my burrito.   I should make it clear though that I'm very grateful for Food Fight's existence.  If it wasn't a Tex Tubb's it would be an Iguana Mia, Chi Chi's or some other Darden crap chain and at least Food Fight is local.   And I do appreciate Monty's...."}
{"text":"Meh.   It's fine. The tacos are pretty good. The salsa is okay. The margaritas seem way better when they're discounted.  ;-)  This place is solid. I never mind going here, and I like it when I do. But it's never somewhere I decide to go of my own accord."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to go in Wisconsin for Tex Mex food.  I could literally eat everything on the menu and have minimal complaints.  The drinks are amazing and the white whiskey margarita is my #1 go-to drink by far.  Parking is the only issue I think everyone has during the busy hours, but I can handle that since the pros completely outweigh the cons with Tex Tubb's."}
{"text":"The ambiance is that of a pretty run of the mill TexMex restaurant. Service came quick. This app got us some free nachos and the different salsa dips were very good.   We didn't try the margaritas so no review there but I had the steak tacos with refries beans and rice. The tacos were pretty good and the steak was juicy. The refries beans were nice and creamy. The rice was some of the better rice I've had at a place like. There was corn and a bit of a spice.   My wife had chicken tacos that had quite a bit of flavor but the black beans were kind of dry and boring. She had the same rice I did.  Nothing great here but a nice stop. We would come again and try some margaritas and other entrees."}
{"text":"I can't help but agree with Sean D. below.... I have been going to Tex Tubb's since it opened and have lived around the corner for the past three years, and everything about the place has gone seriously downhill in the past year. We keep going back in hopes that we'll land on something tasty off the new-ish menu, but there are really only few options that appeal there now.    The last time we ate dinner there I ordered the \"Big Bowl of Pork Chile Verde\" and all at the table agreed that its color/texture resembled dogfood. It was a mushy, flavorless grey paste with tough strands of pork throughout.  I couldn't eat more than two bites. The accompanying blue corn muffin was raw in the center.  I've sampled quite a few of the new menu's tacos. Most are ok, but they all suffer from the new tortillas-- the old ones were really good and I think soft corn? and at least tasted house-made. These are more grocery store- chewy and flavorless.   The chips used to be hot, crispy, and perfect! Now they taste like stale Tostitos.  Ironically, they also used to be free, and now there's a charge for them. It was a big letdown the first time we went after the chip change- we don't get them anymore.   Tex Tubb's used to have a fun, kitschy vibe.  That's been replaced with grime, slow service, and cheap fixtures. I miss the old fashioned photo booth, but I miss the clean bathrooms more!"}
{"text":"Our group of 9 called ahead and a table in the back of the restaurant was ready for us when we arrived.  Yelpers, be sure to use your check-ins to redeem free baskets of bottomless chips & salsa! They had four salsas to choose from, one verde, and three red salsas. The chips arrived warm, crispy, and hearty.  Everyone ordered mostly tacos, you choose between, two or three-platters, or a la cart tacos. You are able to mix and match. I chose the el pastor & pineapple and crispy tilapia. I'm not sure if my tilapia tacos came out incorrectly, it was not crispy as in fried but grilled. Either way it was cooked perfectly, moist lump fish with guacamole and cabbage slaw. The el pastor didn't have a hint of pineapple or much memorable flavor, it helps to have the salsa bar to our avail.   Where they do swoon me is their side options of  rice and black beans, rice and refried beans, jicama slaw, house-pickled vegetables, or ancho-dusted sweet potato fries. Everyone in our group got all of the variations of the sides. The clear winner were the sweet potato fries. Typical sweet potato fries have inconsistent mushy/crispy exterior, however these were cooked to perfection and crispy throughout. The house-pickled vegetables were interesting mix of cauliflower, jalapenos, white onions, and carrots.   Everyone seemed happy with their order, the service was friendly for a large group, until then end when we had to wait extra long for our checks. There's definitely better tasting tacos for the price tag, but in the Atwood neighborhood, this place will do."}
{"text":"I hadn't tried this place before but my order was wrong and the \"rub\" on the chicken was clumpy and super salty. There were chunks of it all over my salad which made it kind of inedible. Disappointing for the price."}
{"text":"We've visited twice and although the atomosphere is nice the food is boring. They should spend less time worrying about gluten and more time worrying about flavor. Taco Time has a better salsa bar."}
{"text":"I really like Tex Tubbs.  I can't speak to the drinks, since I don't drink alcohol, but they have an excellent array of very unique tacos.  I don't love all the different varieties, but they're all well made, interesting, and fun to try.  You can also mix and match, if you want to try a single taco of some type, without committing your whole meal to it.  The nacho plates are huge - you'll need at least two people to get through them, and you should count on them being your whole meal unless you have 4+ people, or eat like a horse.  I've tried the burritos/chimis once or twice, and they're good, but that's a little like going to a steak house and ordering a burger.  If you're at Tex Tubbs, you really should get tacos.  The salsa bar is good, if not particularly diverse.  It'd be nice if they added one more type of salsa, and maybe change that one up every week.  The prices seem very reasonable to me, considering that the food is fresh and well-made.  It's somewhat more expensive than Chipotle, but it's also better food.  I agree with the other reviewer who said it would be nice to get free chips with a tex-mex dinner, but I suppose they'd have to charge everyone more, even though not everyone wants chips.  And frankly, when we do buy chips, I have trouble finishing my entree anyway.  The restaurant tends to be crowded and can be noisy, but that's what happens when you stick a good restaurant into an old building.  Think of it as \"having character\".  The atmosphere and experience remind me of Pepper's Pizza (RIP) in Chapel Hill, which billed itself as \"a sunny place for shady people\".  We always try to avoid \"Family Night\", which I think was on Mondays during the summer.  It just attracted too many noisy kids.  If you have noisy kids, it's a great time to take them, since I won't be there."}
{"text":"Tubbs is a great spot for Tex-Mex (not authentic Mexican food), and has a great salsa bar. I would recommend getting a margarita from the menu, but not their traditional one because they have so much more to offer. The Frito burrito never disappoints, and the service is always excellent. Be prepared to wait for a table on the weekends, but you can head to One Barrel for a beer while you wait!"}
{"text":"I still like the idea of Tex Tubb's but the execution has been really off the last couple of times I've been here.  I'll give any place the benefit of the doubt once, but I've unfortunately had three consecutive misses and I think the bloom is off the rose, at least for the University location.  I'm not one to hate on the Food Fight restaurants like some, but the standard trope that these places start off strong and fade down the line seems to be the case here.  I've always had a bit of an issue with the cost and sometimes the service, but the quality of the tacos had always more than offset any problems.  That hasn't been the case lately.    My #1 complaint: flour tortillas instead of corn.  Three times now I've gotten flour despite specifically ordering corn tortillas.  The first time I sent it back with minimum hassle, but the last two were not fun.  On the second go-around I was initially told that I hadn't actually ordered corn tortillas and then that the even if I had the carne asada doesn't come that way (not true).  Since it was just a tortilla I gave up the argument but stiffed her on the tip and avoided the place for few months, until just recently.  This time I ordered the mushroom taco, and the server didn't linger after dropping off our order was gone before I noticed the error.  I wasn't able to flag anyone down and after 10 minutes or so I just ate the now-cold taco.  What's really annoying about this whole thing is that it's just a tortilla - normally I don't get too excited about tortillas.  If they completely got rid of the soft corn tacos I'd be disappointed but not crushed.  It's just that I prefer the corn tortillas and they're on the menu, so it pisses me off when I continue ordering them and never, ever get what I request.  If it were just the continual cockblocking on the tortilla front I'd be slightly histrionic but I'd survive.  After all, the fish tacos always come with corn tortillas.  But I think the whole experience lifted the scales from my eyes in a way since I started noticing that the deficiencies in the University location were beginning to show.  The chips are stale and the salsas mediocre.  My request for hot sauce went initially unanswered on two separate occasions, requiring a reminder.  The carne asada didn't taste nearly as good as I had remembered and the achiote tilapia was off.   We once waited a good five minutes at the front counter waiting for the hostess to get off the phone.  All of these little complaints are minor in their own right, but added up it makes me realize that my opinion of Tex Tubb's has turned.  I still enjoyed aspects of the place as much as I had before, but the negatives have outweighed the positives and I'd rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Consistency in food is all over the place. Sometimes the tacos are huge and overflowing; sometimes skimpy. The beans and rice are weirdly flavorless. The queso is dynamite. And their salsa is perfect."}
{"text":"super bummed about my last experience here. Probably my last visit here. The waiter forgot our drinks and food order. They were obviously confused and forgot that we ordered. I watched the waiter get trained by the bar tender on how to make the drinks. Mine tasted great but my lady's was awful. Went up to the bar and asked BOTH bar tenders to try the drink. They tried and said it tasted sweet... I tried the ginger beer by itself and it tasted amazing, unlike my drink. A $9 drink that was just sipped out of and you wouldn't just remake it. Sorry to the waiter for getting a 2 dollar tip on a 40 bill, but that is awful service. The drink tasted fowl. You're not getting my families money anymore textubs."}
{"text":"It wasn't the best mexican food that I have had ...being that I lived in San Diego and went to Mexico all the time..but overall the food was good cheese dip was the stuff ;) and great service I will return ..."}
{"text":"So we just exited Tex Tubb's after 50 minutes. Without food. Or refills. Or chips.   I would be more understanding about our food not making it out after nearly an hour if our server had ever checked on us. (She informed us as we were leaving that our slip had dropped below the line of orders.)   Since she didn't ever check in, we couldn't tell her that we were starving. Or that we never received the chips we ordered (which would have helped that starving bit). Or that we could have used some more water.   We usually rely on Food Fight restaurants for friendly, efficient service and delicious food, but we were sorely disappointed in this experience. Hopefully Tex Tubb's hires more and/or better staff."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town. My wife and I have eaten here dozens of times. I've celebrated numerous events (birthdays, that kind of thing) here with friends, family, and coworkers.  I'll start with the margaritas. They're expensive if you compare them to some place that serves a BS mix poured into cruddy tequila. But these are real-deal margaritas, made with real squeezed lime juice, orange liqueur, and good tequila. You're not gonna get a 32oz monster like you would at Pedro's, but trust me... they are plenty strong. I've been working on my own margarita recipe for a while, and Tex Tubb's makes my second favorite margaritas in town.  The food... so good. I'm a big fan of the tacos. Our favorites are the green chile chicken (my wife usually orders just these, two or three of them), the hot mama, the house smoked pork, and the pork belly. Really just wonderful all around.  The wait staff is my favorite in town. They're very nice, funny, and helpful."}
{"text":"So- I finally went to Tex Tub's. It was one of the last Food Fight restaurants that I had not been to, and my takeaway is \"meh.\" I feel like the best mexican restaurants are either going to be very cheap ( a la Guadalajara on Park Street) or fine dining. I think this restaurant is right in the middle.   The Chips and Salsa were okay, although the chips tasted a bit burnt.  I ordered the three taco platter with a side of rice and beans. I got one pork belly taco, one steak taco, and one fried chicken taco. All of them were okay- not much flavor. The rice and beans were bland too.  I ordered a  blended strawberry margarita because it was happy hour and they were only $3.00. It's exactly what you think a $3 margarita would taste like- very sweet, not much tequila.   Service was great, which is why this gets 2 stars."}
{"text":"I love Tex Tubb's and it is a good thing it is on the other side of town from me or I would eat there every day."}
{"text":"This is a real fun place that serves Tex Mex style food. The atmosphere is casual and colorful.   The menu is full of options including, burritos, tacos, tortas and fajitas. There are a number of sides that one can order in addition to these entrees. I had a three taco platter with a tequila lime shrimp, fried fish, and carne asada taco. Mixed feelings about the tacos: the combination of ingredients that came on each taco was fun, but, it seemed like some of the meats were sitting around. The quick delivery of the food, which is a great thing,  reinforces my concern that maybe some of meats are cooked in batches and sits too long under a heater. The greatest concern being is there is a lost of flavor, texture, and freshness to the bite.  When we went the salsa bar was available but there were no bowls for us to load salsa in.  I asked for some to be brought out and I was told it will be 25 minutes because they were all in the dishwasher. So we had a salsa-less meal.  The margaritas and service were both great. This is a fun casual restaurant and I will certainly be happy to visit again."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place 4 stars, but...stopped in here for lunch while in Madison. Be sure to check in with Yelp so you get free chips and salsa - which are delicious, by the way. You can choose from four different salsas at the salsa bar. We had the red and green medium, both of which were very yummy. Had a classic mango margarita - delish. So the reason I'm giving only 3 stars is because of the food. I had the steak tacos...first of all, there was hardly any meat on them and secondly, the steak was very tough and chewy. Very disappointing. My husband had the shrimp tacos which he said were skimpy on the shrimp (seems to be a theme here), but were good. A positive note about the ambiance: a lot of restaurants have TV screens all over the place, so your attention naturally diverts to that instead of the person or people you're dining with. This place didn't have TV screens - which is a huge plus in my book. Also, they were playing good music - not pop music - and it was low enough where it was just noticeable. Perfect."}
{"text":"Second time at Tex Tubb's, both times for brunch. Each time we got seated right away, which is somewhat surprising considering the popularity of this spot. The service was great and the food is really tasty if you enjoy your eggs with a Mexican flare. I have had both the weekend scrambler and the veggie skillet. Personally, I liked the veggie skillet better, but both were really good. They both came with a lot of veggies, which are altered based on the season.   What didn't I like about the scrambler? I would say the eggs were a bit overdone making it feel like I was eating an omelet instead. Not necessarily a bad thing, but just not what I was expecting.   I'll definitely be back though, and I'll probably order the skillet if I don't feel like trying something new!"}
{"text":"Birthday month date night!  I've been wanting to come here for AGES.  I got the margarita flight with Strawberry, Melon and Prickly Pear.  I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the pear one, but it ended up being my favorite!  We tried three of the salsas from the salsa bar--mild, verde and a hotter one.  The chips at Tex Tubbs might be some of the best tortilla chips I've ever had.  Salty, crisp.  For dinner I got the taco platter with 3 tacos--Hot Mama, Carne con Salsa Verde, and a fish taco. I thought they were good, but not exceptional. My favorite was the fish taco, but could have used more sauce.  I got sweet potato fries as my side.  They came with a delicious dipping sauce.  The sad part was I took home leftovers and forgot about them in the car so they were no longer good. I'll be back for more margaritas, chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Great selection of delicious and unusual tacos. All of the ingredients homemade. Especially loved the achiote chicken and smoked meats. Would recommend the crispy tilapia as well. Decently priced for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! Luckily, I got there early enough and snagged a table right away. I went on National Margarita Day, so this place got busy FAST! Of course I ordered a margarita, and the server told us about their happy hour deals, so we took advantage while we had time.  I had a 3 taco platter with the green Chile chicken, chipotle braised beef, and el pastor. I loved all of them! 3 tacos was way too much - I should have only gotten 2. My friend got a side salad with her tacos, and they never brought her dressing out. They also never checked on us, so she never ate her salad. :-( She never asked if I wanted another drink when I finished mine, and it took us time to get the check. This is all surprising because the place was hopping, and they probably needed the table.  I should probably only give this place 3 stars based on the service (or lack of) that we received, but I love the atmosphere and food so much that I'll bump it up to 4, and I'll go back soon!"}
{"text":"Tex Tubbs was sadly underwhelming. We heard from my bf's coworker about the Date Night deal on Wednesday they have here, where you get a basket of chips & queso. 2 taco platters, and an ice cream sundae for $25.   We liked the vibe there, it was pretty chill and it was what we expected. We got margaritas and they were pretty good, but nothing special.  The chips seemed like they were store bought and warmed up and the queso seemed like it was just tostitos queso. We weren't very impressed. The waitress let us do half queso bowl and half guac. The guac was good, but it wasn't mixed and mashed all the way.  The tacos came out very fast after we ordered them- almost too fast, like they were already made or something, fast service is usually good, but there was something a little sketchy about how quick it was. The tacos were a pretty bland, which is sorta disappointing when you're at a \"Taco Palace\"  The dessert was a scoop of (I wanna say Breyers) vanilla ice cream, with chocolate sauce in a cinnamon sugar tortilla bowl. It was pretty good-but again underwhelming.   The restaurant really didn't seem to put much effort or pride in to their food-maybe it was just a bad night, but we didn't think the food was worth the money we spent here. I don't think we'll be returning to Taco Palace."}
{"text":"This review is based on the 'Straight Up Flight' I had at Tex Tubb's.  We had already had a great meal at Eldorado Grill but the bar was really full when we were done so we headed to Tex Tubb's for a drink.  I tried the Straight Up Flight at the bar there...I got to try the Palace, Mezcal, and Prickly Pear Margarita.  I have to say - I love a good sampler.  It's so hard to make a choice when there are so many new things you've never had.  The Palace and Mezcal were fine - the Prickly Pear was wonderful!  Now I know what to order next time.  Atmosphere and service was also great!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here!! We went on a Thursday, which they have all day happy hour - $2.50 shiner bottles, $3 drafts, and $3 frozen margaritas among many other things!  Started with a simple chips and salsa for an appetizer. They have a chose your own salsa bar, which is kind of cool. But it gets really crowded and our table was right next to it so that was a little distracting. None of the salsas were amazing, but there salsa verde, I think, was decent. (The only green one)!  I chose a two taco platter for my entree. I got one hot mama (buffalo chicken style taco) and the Baka blackened tilapia with a side of rice and retried beans. The hot mama taco was delicious!! The buffalo sauce they drizzled on had a nice flavor with a little kick. Two thumbs up. The tilapia however left me disappointed. I just didn't care for the sauces and the blackened seasoning did nothing for it.   I tried some sweet potato fries that came with my sisters order, and those were on point. Nice and crispy with a good dipping sauce. My boyfriend also really enjoyed his food; he tried three separate tacos (although the he said the chorizo one was rather greasy).   All in all, it was a good time. While I didn't care for one of my tacos, there was so much else to chose from that sounded delicious that I give it five stars. Our service was great and everyone was so friendly. Great atmosphere and I enjoyed the decor, however tacky tex mex decor can get! Would love to come back."}
{"text":"This place has a good selection of yummy tacos to pick from. The atmosphere is relatively nice and the service is fast.   I'd recommend going with the 2 taco platter. The tacos are bigger than average, and I was definitely full after 2 but somehow managed to stuff another one in my face.   I tried the pork-marinated-with-pineapple-soda taco, Baja blackened tilapia taco, and the steak taco (name had the word Carne in it but I forget the rest). The first did not live up to expectations  and I ended up only picking at it. The last two were both really good!  I got some root beer which was a bit of a weird choice with tacos but really good.   All together my bill came to $15, and I wished I had just gone with 2 tacos. Learned for next time!  Another note: definitely lots of vegan or vegetarian friendly options that my friend said were really amazing!"}
{"text":"I am Not a fan. A la carte pricing means your dinner becomes really expensive really fast. There are things on the menu (like the ground beef tacos) that are simply not good. If friends want to go here, I get two fried fish tacos and then eat something later around 9pm.  The real mystery is: Why do my friends keep wanting to go here?"}
{"text":"Tex Tubb's is a great Tex-Mex restaurant with an Austin vibe. My husband and I have visited with our friends on numerous occasions simply because we crave it. Each time we visit we get something different and have yet to be disappointed by a meal there. On our most recent visit I had the carne asada tacos, a classic. Everything about them was delicious, and just as good as a taco from a true Mexican restaurant (although a bit more pricey).  They have an impressive variety of margaritas on the menu. My favorite still though is the classic lime margarita on the rocks. It is delicious, but somewhat small in size. You can get a much larger margarita at a cheaper Mexican restaurant for a lot less.   We have had a mix of service quality on our numerous visits. The first two times we were there our servers were very attentive and friendly. Our most recent visit was a bit frustrating, as it took our server quite a long time to visit our table after we were seated, and then to collect the bill after we finished our meal. I'm guessing though that this was just fluke and it must have just been a busy night. Either way it won't stop us from coming back.  Even though Tex Tubb's is more expensive than most Mexican restaurants, the wide variety of drinks and quality of food make it worth it. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Rest In Peace, home of my favorite fish taco...we'll make the trek to the East Side.  The Blackened Tilapia Tacos were out of this world, the Limeade almost as good as a margarita.  We tried to support you with regular visits...I know we became known as \"that Fish Taco couple in the booth'. But in the end, it wasn't enough."}
{"text":"We went here kind of in a drive by sort of way looking for a BBQ place in Madison while we were on a short job.  The staff were SO friendly and the food was really quite good.  We had the brisket sandwich and a chicken sandwich and weren't disappointed.  The owner came by to talk to us and gave us directions to the best custard place which was a really nice touch."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My husband and I had a gift card for a food fight restaurant and came here for the first time.  Place was packed but amazingly we got a table in like twenty min.  From the atmosphere to the music it's a great place.  The food and drinks were great.  Even our waiter Matt rocked!  Truly is my favorite new place and we will be back."}
{"text":"After running some errands my wife and I needed a place to grab a quick bite and we happened to be next to Tex Tubb's Taco Palace.  A quick taco sounded great!  WARNING:  This is not even close to authentic mexican or Tex-Mex food.  So if that is what you are looking for....go to Mexico or Texas because it is hard to find in Madison.  Walking in, it was decorated nice and a bit over the top but thats is the gimmick.  After sitting down I was a bit taken back that they charged $1.00 for chips and salsa.  OMG...$1.00...we got some and some queso dip as well.  The chips were very good and the salsa was decent.  The queso dip however lacked in flavor.  I had 2 different tacos.  The first was a soft shredded beef taco and the second I decided to go for the Philly Cheese Steak taco.  Both tacos were very good especially the Philly Cheesesteak taco.  It was different and I liked that.  My wife got the cheeseburger quesadilla and she enjoyed it very much (WARNING:  Food is very greasy and will give you gas).  I had some and thought it was...eh...it was ok.  So, I enjoyed Tex Tubb's and would eat there again if in the area but would not go out of my way to get it.  What was cool is they served tall boys of PBR!"}
{"text":"Go for the ambiance, stay for the margaritas. Tex Tubb's gets away with having average tacos, because everything else about the place is so great. The atmosphere, the staff, the drinks and the salsa bar."}
{"text":"We love coming here for tacos! I typically get the 2 taco platter ($9.99) - You can mix and match any two taco's on the menu! I recommend the \"baja fish taco\" and the \"steak and salsa verde taco\". The fish taco has a KICK thanks to the chipotle crema that they lather all over it. Another fan fave on the menu = the frito burrito. This thing is HUUUUGE! Definitely able to make it last for two meals... not sure I've ever seen anyone finish it in one sitting. Chips and salsa are not free, BUT if you check in on Yelp, you get a free chips/salsa voucher to use then or save for later - Just show it to the waiter/waitress and voila!   Typically the service is great, however, at our last visit here, the waitress seemed quite disinterested. She was not attentive in the least - The place was not busy whatsoever. It took almost 20 minutes to get our order in, and then another 15 minutes at the end of our meal for boxes to keep our leftovers in."}
{"text":"This is one of the few Food Fight Inc. establishments I go to occasionally. People seam to love it or hate it. It was better before Food Fight took it over and cheapened the menu, but the original character shows in some ways - especially the variety of fish tacos, the salsa bar, breakfast and the kitschy interior.   My extended family loves the cheap margaritas. I think they are sugar bombs - worth the money only if you want to get drunken and fat. I stick with the top shelf margaritas.   Casual attire (shorts in summer) is standard. Service is efficient, sometimes too efficient, as I have had dishes swiped from the table as the last bite was going in my mouth.    Definitely better than the ubiquitous dive Mexican joints. Worth a try. You might love it. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I REALLY want to love this place.  Its in my neighborhood, it has a good atmosphere.  Its a fun place to take visitors or to meet up with friends.  Margaritas are just OK and the food reads well on the menu, but for me, its just not that exciting to eat.  Salsa is good, service is good, but considering it all, the food just really knocks it down a few stars.  Tip:  if you are a brunch lover, there are so many delicious places in Madison, I would not waste your Sat/Sun here"}
{"text":"I am in love with the Taco Palace! The food is delicious, margarita's were delicious, the menu is diverse with it's selection, and they have a wonderful salsa bar with different types of salsa for your homemade chips!   Stop what you are doing and go!!!!"}
{"text":"This is where I wish Yelp allowed half stars, as I would go 4.5.   Went for brunch. We were greeted by a friendly host as we walked in.  Nice. Thanks Shea!  Ate at bar. Bartender's service was perfect. Thanks Heather!  Forgot how good the salsa bar is.   Great grapefruit Margarita.   Only half star deduction was that the ancho dusted potatoes were soggy, and I wish I had ordered flour tortillas as the corn get soggy with sauce. But well managed, friendly, good service, and the majority of the food is very good to great. Also, no surprise, but seems to be well managed. Always good to see a manager doing actual work and helping out - shout out to Tony.   And we head they will have a Bloody Mary bar soon!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a hankering for tacos, and I remembered this little gem. It's such an awesome place for some really delicious and filling tacos, at an equally amazing price! The atmosphere is cozy, but not overly loud like it can get in smaller place; and our waitress was the perfect amount of attentive and sweet. I ordered the backyard BBQ and shrimp tequila taco platter, and I swear I died and went to taco heaven! I also ordered the margarita flight (prickly pear, mango, and melon) which was super adorable, and hit that perfect sweet to match with the salty tacos. YUUUUMMMM-O!!!"}
{"text":"I find the Taco Palace to be somewhat confusing.  It may look like a hole-in-the-wall authentic tex-mex place, but it is actually a very contrived  theme restaurant brought to you by the Food Fight folks.  Coming from CA, I'm used to going to places that look like this for authentic cheap grub.    The Taco Palace food is good but the prices don't match the atmosphere.   Three bucks for a small fish taco is two dollars too many.  Fifteen minutes to wait for two tacos to go was ten minutes too many.  Nevertheless, the food was decent and the atmosphere was pleasant so I may come back with friends in the future."}
{"text":"I have been here three times over the past three months for lunch.   I am giving up on Tex Tubb's.  The last two visits have been well below average, despite friendly service.  For a place with a creative menu, the flavors of the dishes I have tried simply do not pop. The salsas have been bland, and the texture of the meat -- most specifically, the fried chicken -- has been surprisingly bad. Things are cooked to an appropriate doneness, they just haven't tasted good.  Return visits will be limited to a drink at the bar, or simply having a margarita if friends want to eat here.  Two tacos, a side, chips and salsa, water, tax, and tip came out to $14.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Delicious pitchers of Margaritas!  Not watered down with some real taste. We stopped by late for nachos and drinks. Service was great and had to order a second pitcher."}
{"text":"My review is of Tex Tubb's catering service/food (which is very much a slimmed-down version of the in-restaurant menu):  Tacos! For a wedding! YES!  This may be the most talked-about part of our reception. A taco buffet was a unique choice, but it was one that everyone loved. Crystal, the catering manager, worked with us to create a slightly custom menu from their usual catering options and then they ended up bringing even more food than we expected. While this was great, it did feel a little wasteful. Since Tex Tubb's does a \"drop off\" catering service with disposable chafing dishes, etc. we were left with a lot of food and taco shells at the end of the night. Thankfully the staff at the venue were happy to take the extras (along with extra wedding cake!) to nibble on before going home and to have a football party the next day!  At first I though the pricing was high for being tacos, but they had so many sides and options (great for meat eaters, veggies, vegans, etc) and TONS of chips & salsa that, considering the catering market in Madison, I feel we got a decent value. They definitely made for a fun wedding meal!"}
{"text":"Tex Tubb's has an Austin vibe, with Willie Nelson for President posters and George Jones 8-tracks as decor.  The food is rather good, if not spectacular.  I'm a fan of the mushroom tacos (traditional style on corn tortillas) and two-dollar Shiners during happy hour from 4pm - 6pm.  It's a cozy place to go for a change of scene, and pretty dead-on for Austin-style Tex-Mex."}
{"text":"I brought a friend from Austin here and he absolutely flipped over how much it reminded him of home. Having only been to Austin once myself, I can't say whether or not they're serving authentic Tex-Mex, but Tex Tubb's certainly seemed to be trying. This is the only place in Madison I've seen that has Lone Star and Shiner available, and the fried avocado taco was certainly a welcome departure from the usual Mexican food.  Also an excellent idea on their part - the frito pie. A bag of frito chips topped with chili, salsa, cheese, sour cream, and various other goodies. I tend to hate fritos, but this was really delicious. And I attribute that to the quality of the ingredients they were using."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Madison. I've been there a couple times and enjoyed the food and atmosphere very much.  My first time there, I had the Frito Burrito. Fun to say and delicious to eat! The second time, I had smoked brisket taco platter. Both dishes were plentiful and yummy.  I also had the Frozen Flight of Margarita's. If you can't make a decision on which flavor to pick, this is a great way of getting mini Margarita's to try. They come in 6oz glasses and you get three flavors.  If you love Mexican food, get out to Tex Tubb's!"}
{"text":"We had a coupon for Tex Tubb's Taco Palace so we decided to check it out. We'd never been to the Atwater area. It was quirky with lots of unique stores, interesting architecture, and a fun young vibe. Tex Tubb's fit in perfectly.  It was pretty crowded, but with only two of use, we are able to get right in. Our coupon got us chips and a small bowl of queso and a small bowl of guacamole. The guacamole has a lot of pico de gallo mixed in. Both were tasty. The chips however were primarily broken little pieces which were hard to dip. There is also a small salsa bar which you can help yourself to which includes four salsas: a mild red, a green, more of a ranchero, and a spicy one.  I ordered the tamale platter. One chicken and one beef tamale. They were both huge. There was a decent amount of meat in both but there was a huge amount of masa. I had a green sauce on the chicken and a red sauce on the beef. They both needed more sauce to help get down the masa. Luckily that have the salsa bar. I had the refried beans and rice for sides. The beans were pretty standard. But the rice. The rice really stood out for me. It was light and fluffy. Like a basmati rice but with intense Mexican seasonings. I really liked this rice and I wanted more of it. The portion size was huge. I had to get a box for leftovers which is very unusual.   I would not order the tamales again but I would definitely go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"We got there early based on reviews and service. Salsa bar was better than I expected based on reviews. So was service. Maybe we just read too many bad reviews.   Free chips and salsa with Yelp was nice. Tacos were just ok. Cuban was good. Tilapia was ok. Portabella was lacking ingredients.   Service was good."}
{"text":"Tex Tubbs is in my neighborhood but I don't go to it much. The food is more Americanized, especially the salsa, so if this sounds like your kind of thing, the service is always delightful (but not enough to go back very often)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and look forward to returning! All the salsas in the salsa bar are fantastic, especially the spiciest one, and I really enjoyed the selection of tacos I ordered, especially the vegan poblano ones. I would HIGHLY recommend their brunch menu! We got the vegan French toast and the pancakes with ghost pepper syrup (don't be scared, it's not super spicy!) and they did not disappoint! Portions were generous which was great because we had leftovers for later. The only thing I didn't like was that the bloody Marys had too much spice. However the grapefruit margarita was fantastic. This is a cute area of Madison that doesn't get as much recognition as the square area so people should check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is good for dining at if you're with a group, but it sucks to wait for a table if you're with a group. There is no good waiting area, so I always feel like I'm in the way (because I am) if I don't get seated immediately. I stood directly outside the door once while waiting for a table. I was told it would be 15-20 minutes, so at the 15 minute mark, I went back inside to find that the waitress had JUST given away my table away to a couple who JUST walked in. She said she called my name :-t Many places will call your name outside, especially if their waiting area is small or nonexistent, and I was standing within view of the hostess stand.   Regardless, Taco Tub holds a special place in my heart. I lovingly call this place Taco Tub because when I first moved here, I couldn't remember the full name of this restaurant. My friends and I come here for dinner regularly, and we ALWAYS get queso and Palace Margaritas (happy hour specials all day on T/Th! $5 for the Palace Margarita and $20 for a pitcher, among other things).  I'm not done talking about the queso. It's the first thing you should order when you get here. It might make it harder (or impossible) for you to finish your dinner, but that's okay because THEY HAVE THE BEST QUESO. They have a salsa bar, too, but the queso is where it's at.  I urge you to try their black bean and corn flautas and their chile rellenos. These are my two favorite dishes. Their refried beans are excellent. I do not recommend the Frito burrito, and I can't say I loved their enchiladas. However, they have a wide variety of tacos! Favorites include blackened tilapia and backyard BBQ. I've been eyeing their nachos for a while, too, so I think I need to try these soon.  PLEASE GET QUESO AND MARGARITAS AT TACO TUB. You won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"Used the check in for free chips and salsa, which ended up being bottomless which was nice. It's unfortunate to go to a Mexican restaurant that doesn't offer free chips and salsa, but the check in made up for it. It was nice that they offer a salsa bar to pick your own to bring back to the table. We enjoyed both the mild and tomatillo salsas they were delicious. Our entire group went for the margarita flight, which in my opinion was a major selling point of this restaurant. You get 3 decent sized margaritas in different flavors for around $8 which isn't bad. I tried peach, lime, and the pink cactus. They were all really good, but pink cactus was extremely sweet. We tried the tacos and were impressed with how many options for tacos there were. There were also a lot of vegetarian options. I tried both steak taco options (2) and I thought both were decently good. They definitely give you a lot in each taco, so I was not disappointed portion wise. My friend got three vegetarian tacos: fried avocado, fried cauliflower, and portobello. These were also large portions and she enjoyed them. It is not your typical authentic Mexican experience, and not your typical Tex-Mex experience either. It's a unique Mexican style here but it definitely works."}
{"text":"I ordered Tubb's off of a delivery service so I can't speak to the atmosphere, but I was satisfied with the size of the tacos, the variety, and the flavor.   Good stuff."}
{"text":"Tex Tubbs really frustrates me. It's so inconsistent, food-wise, and I'm not sure why. Most often, the food is under-seasoned. The menu descriptions always sound appealing, but the actual product is...meh....bland, unremarkable. Their margaritas are good but small. I love the location and the neighborhood, I just wish the food was better. Also, the salsa bar drives me nuts, it's always so dirty and crowded."}
{"text":"If it weren't for terrible parking I would give this place 5 stars! Even bicycle parking can be tough. That aside, how can you go wrong with a swanky Tex-Mex joint that plays classic country and serves Coke products? Five stars it is! The restaurant has authentic options for meat lovers, vegetarians, and even vegans! The vegetarian fajitas are exceptional, and if you are ordering a standard entree you can opt for a side of seasonal pickled veggies. Who knew cauliflower could knock your socks off? The staff is friendly, and the management outstanding! When my husband brought a minor issue to their attention, they offered him a $25 gift certificate to say thank you. It was an unnecessary gesture and the kindness did not go unnoticed. We will continue to remain loyal customers as long as the service and food stay top notch!"}
{"text":"I will eat here when a friend insists, but I think almost every time I've eaten here, I have gotten diarrhea.  And the food isn't worth the diarrhea.  Its kind of bland.  And its overpriced.  Just my opinion though.  I know lots of people are ga-ga over this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this taco joint several times now and figured I should review it. I absolutely love their food. The tacos are great and there are so many options. Plus they have amazing chips and salsa to feast on while you wait for your food. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!!!The shrimp taco was to die for. Great vibe, great service. First time here just moved from the good old Southwest \"Arizona\" would highly recommend this place. See you soon. BTW Peyton thanks for the fantastic service and your recommendations."}
{"text":"This is a solid place that is fun to attend after a long day of work. They have a pretty good happy hour for drinks ($2 Lone Star beers and I believe $2.50 taps) along with a wide variety of intriguing looking soft tacos all of which are around $2-3 each. The tacos are not authentic, but most are creative and loaded with the sort of ingredients americans crave. The best way I could describe it is a Red Robin menu in a tortilla. There are variety of different meats and veggies, usually all accompanied by multiple garnishes, seasonings and sauces.  I've tried several tacos there, but my favorite so far is the Taco Al Pastor. The combination of pork, pineapple and melted jack cheese just works so well together from a texture and flavor standpoint.  The salsa bar is nice, but none of the salsas are really outstanding.  The prices are great. I was there with three buddies and our total for a meal and several beers was under $50. The previous week I went to the Great Dane with just one friend and between the two of us we spent about the same. It'll be hard to justify that trip again."}
{"text":"austin style, tex mex tacos - super vegan and vegetarian friendly! so many vegan things to choose from.  Our food was really tastey too. staff was SO kind and welcoming as well. Definitely planning to eat here again."}
{"text":"Tubbs is a mixed bag, drinks are ok, service is usually ok and the food is ok.  In particular the new menu is an improvement with several of the new tacos (BBQ comes to mind, as does the Friday fish fry) being tasty but the salsa and chips are really crummy.  Even the generic-ish midwestern Mexican places in Madison have better salsa and the chips are unappetizing with a strange lime-popcorn flavor.  The salsas were always not to my taste but the quality really seems down on them now.  If I recall the ambiance used to be Austin funky, alt country bands, records on the walls.  Recently it was more generic.  Pretty much the place to go when you want an interesting Taco and don't feel like driving out of the near east side."}
{"text":"I love this area and i love the chips here. Tex Tubbs always has a wait, but don't worry, it moves fast. I came during brunch hours on a Saturday and waited about 20 minutes for a table. Would have been the perfect amount of time to grab a beer but my friends and I were being conservative today.   Once seated we all knew what we wanted. Tacos and some guac to share. The great thing about tex Tubb's is that the chips are unlimited, and free with a yelp check in, plus you get all you can eat access to the salsa bar. Needless to say it is delish and you need to try each salsa. Verde, mild, medium, and hot.   We got an arrangement of tacos including fried avocados, el pastor and pineapple, grilled steak, and blackened cod. They were all good and solid tacos. The el pastor was a little sweet for me, I wanted it to be spicier. The steak was good, tender and with lots of flavor. Fried avocados, well... who could go wrong with that, and the blackened cod was fresh, but lacked the kick of flavor I was hoping for.   As my review started, the chips are the best and the guac on the side is hefty and delicious. A must have. He environment is great and I'm a fan but overall it wasn't anything absolutely amazing. I'd still come back for those chips, good company, and maybe a beer next door    Happy chip eating!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to give this place five stars, but after this visit--our first--I'd say three stars is generous.     Tuesday and Thursday nights are Happy Hour all evening which is popular.  We came on a Tuesday evening and were pleased that we were seated within two minutes. Our server, Courtney, was friendly and took our order fairly promptly. Then we waited.....  And waited....  I know it's busy, but waiting well over a half hour for our food seems excessive.  Oh, and by the way, Courtney, if you had bothered to come back and check on us, I would have had another drink--maybe two!   Dinner finally arrives and Courtney disappears again.  I immediately noticed that the side of black beans I had ordered had been replaced by refried beans--not a big deal.  A minute later, my wife notices that the corn shells she had ordered for her tacos had been replaced by flour ones--and she really did not like them at all.   Maybe ten minutes later, we were able to catch Courtney as she walked past our table.  We explained the two mistakes on our meals and there was a deafening silence.   We waited for her to offer to have my wife's tacos remade, but she just stood there mute.  My wife finally asked for a couple corn tortillas which Courtney did bring.      We finished our meal and waited for our bill. And waited....   And waited....   We didn't see Courtney for quite awhile--fifteen or twenty minutes--but were finally able to to flag her down and request our bill.   I don't mind a leisurely dinner, but over two hours for some tacos is absurd    I can completely understand mistakes being made now and then, but two mistakes on two dinners is a pretty poor batting average!  Even more important, I think, is how those mistakes are handled.  To not even offer to remake a wrongly-made meal is unforgivable.  We won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want to sit in the bar, get a Lone Star, some chips and guac, and a couple tacos. The tacos aren't knock-your-socks-off delicious, but I wouldn't push them off the table, either, and there are some interesting combinations to try. The atmosphere is a lot of fun, and I always miss Texas a bit when we come here."}
{"text":"I've never met a taco I didn't like, especially a fish taco, so this has been a staple place for us since they opened.  I'm watching my waistline right now, so after devouring a basket of chips I decided to order a salad. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the honey chicken spinach salad was. A bed of spinach, topped with strips of real chicken with a thick honey glaze sauce, about 1/4 cup of black beans, 1/4 cup of corn, 3 slices of avocado and a sprinkling of queso fresco. There were also a few tortilla strips included. I had the ranch dressing on the side and didn't need to use much. The salad was very fresh and the perfect size to complement my palace margarita and my chip indulgence. For someone truly trying to eat healthy, this salad is an excellent choice.  The one thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is the salsas are all pretty much the same. I'd love for them to make a salsa that is truly hot. The \"hot\" salsa here has no kick to it at all. The salsa bar would be so much better if there were more distinction between them.  I've had some hits and misses with service over the years, but overall good. One recent waitress was way off her game, but we all have bad days, right? And, clearly, she had something outside work distracting her. I hope she's better now. Tonight's guy accidentally rang up my husband's meal twice, but was very apologetic and quickly corrected it when we told him.   Overall, a fun place for a quick bite or an affordable date night."}
{"text":"The service here is consistently good.  They have margarita specials during happy hour, and the margaritas are pretty good.  There are 8 flavors of margaritas.  It's easy to sample the different kinds of margaritas because they do flights for their margaritas, which allow you to try 3 different margaritas.  The beer selection here is good too when you're not in the mood for a margarita.  There are a variety of tacos to choose from, and you can mix and match tacos when ordering multiple tacos.  My personal favorite is the chipotle braised beef taco.  It has a lot of flavor and a bit of a kick."}
{"text":"Loved everything I've gotten each time I've gone! The limeades are really good and you can't go wrong with anything that has the smoked chicken or pork!"}
{"text":"This place always seems like good idea... And then I realized I forgot how bad it is. The unique tacos sound great and are so creative, but the food is such low quality. Yesterday I came for 3 different tacos and rice and beans. The rice seemed old and tasteless... Like rice you might reheat in your microwave from leftovers last night. The chicken in the southern comfort taco was cold, gummy, and tasteless.  It was inedible. The other two were something I was able to get down, but no better than that only because of the quality of the ingredients (backyard BBQ and el pastor tacos). The only thing I would stop by for is the chips and salsa (so good).  Bottom line: good ideas but until Tex improves the quality of their food stay way."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL customer service and tacos. Chris, the do it all personable genius of a bartender, gave us the perfect recommendations for our palate and showed us a wonderful time. It was really busy, but all of the staff thrived in the environment and the kitchen kept up wonderfully. I recommend the shrimp taco. Very flavorful and would be delicious if you wanted to add some spice with their unique hot sauce selection. Grab a palace margarita with your plate of magic. Thanks for lunch, Chris!"}
{"text":"My family visited Tex Tubb's for the first time tonight. As a vegetarian, it is often difficult to find any interesting choices on a regular menu. This was definitely NOT the case here. Many vegetarian options and all of them sounded delicious! I went with the the vegetarian taco platter and  all 3 were fantastic. The service was WONDERFUL everyone went above and beyond to make sure my Mother in-law (who uses an electric scooter) had everything she needed, including bringing her warm water, soap, and paper towels so she could wash her hands after eating. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a hot mama and portabella mushroom and it was yummy. The portabella was good taste like beef. And Hot Mana is just that hot. Not too much but enough to say hot"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I absolutely love it. It's a great spot for vegans and vegetarians as well. Great margaritas and salsa bar."}
{"text":"Stopped in here based on a friend's recommendation. It seemed busy, but we were quickly seated and our drink orders were taken almost immediately. What we didn't know was that we happened to show up on \"Kids Eat Free\" night, which was an added bonus for the two brats we had to feed (lol).  As a vegetarian, I was quite thrilled at all the offerings. I opted for 3 different tacos on the taco platter (fried Brussels sprouts, avocado, and portobello), all unique and delicious. Kids loved their cheese quesadillas!   My wife ordered a veggie tamale, and that's where the awesomeness kind of went off the rails for a bit. It was really dry (seemed to be 90% masa), lacking veggies, and really didn't even resemble the traditional tamale we were hoping for (and as vegetarians, it is REALLY hard to find meatless tamales!). She notified our waitress of the issue, who was very apologetic and offered to bring another menu to replace her dinner. The manager subsequently came out and additionally apologized, so the way it was handled was extremely professional and did not affect my rating at all. I wish more places conducted themselves in this manner.  All in all it was an enjoyable and friendly dining experience. I'll probably be back at some point, but as I'm from out of town there are a few other Mexican joints in Madison that I need to check out first."}
{"text":"Tex Tubb's Taco Palace is a great place for tacos, burritos, local food, and great drinks.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays they have all day happy hour, which has amazing drink specials.  The taco platters are great, you really can't go wrong, but you certainly can go amazingly right!  The Avocado Frito has deep fried avocado in it, which may be my new favorite fried food!!  The Cubano is also a must, with just the right amount of heat and an amazing, authentic flavor.  I have yet to try any other of the margaritas besides the frozen ones, but even those are delicious, Prickly Pear is a must!!!  Now to talk about the service.  Almost every time I've gone, the service has been above and beyond.  This is in no small part due to their bar manager, William.  He is a phenomenal bartender, not just because of his ability to make delicious drinks, make them quick, and his bar knowledge.  The way he interacts with customers, no matter the age, creed, color, sex, orientation, etc., is what Madison and the world needs.  Seeing him talk with kids and interact with them with such respect and excitement is heartwarming.  The way he can always find something to talk about with people sitting at his bar, he welcomes you in.  He makes you feel at home.  You cannot talk about the success of Tex Tubb's in the Atwood neighborhood or in Madison without mentioning William.  Thank you, and you'll keep me coming back for a long time, and the food will keep me eating and not just drinking!!"}
{"text":"Good food, decent alcohol selection and good margaritas.   Tad pricy on the size vs price of the margaritas.  Busy place but there's a beer joint next door to kill time if needed.  There's really no place to comfortably wait and this place is good enough to be quite busy."}
{"text":"Had a craving for carryout - something new and fun. Stopped into Tex Tubb's Taco Palace and got a burrito and some tacos for the wife. The atmosphere of the place was awesome. Staff was very friendly and very accommodating. Looked like a fun place to dine (will have to do that next time).   Food was fairly inexpensive - and it didn't take that long to make for carryout. We both got the Carne Asada as a meat. It was tasty but a bit tough. Overall the food was yummy, just not knock your socks off yummy. What was good was the sauce/salsa bar they had. I took two different ones home. Neither were too hot - but both were very tasty! Yum!  I would definitely go back again - just to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!! My husband and I were hosting some out-of-town guests and since we are new to the area and haven't tried many area restaurants, we thought we'd give this place a try after reading so many rave reviews. I am convinced the owners are behind all the positive reviews about this place because there were SO MANY bad things we encountered during our first and last visit here. 1) The atmosphere-Based on their website and reviews, it sounded like this place had a fun, inviting atmosphere we were excited to check out. When we arrived, the outside looked quite ghetto, but, not being one to judge a book by its cover, we didn't let that cloud our experience. Upon walking into the place, we learned we should have turned around. I'd describe it as a dark, dingy, dimly-lit atmosphere-not at all fun and inviting.  2) The service-Call me old school, but I'm not a fan of trolls as waitstaff. Our party was seated by the bar, where the waitstaff would occassionally convene. I found it interesting that ALL FOUR of them were completely tatted up with piercings everwhere, ear gages, dark make-up and clothing, and dark hair (blue, pink, bright orange...). Having employees that look so dirty and unprofessional, especially at a dining establishment, was a bad sign.  *Our server (the blue-haired one) knew it was our first time at the restaurant, and instead of being courteous, welcoming, and friendly, was obviously bothered by the couple questions we asked regarding the menu and specials. Also, my sister-in-law said she was unfamiliar with the \"prickly pear\" margarita flavor and asked the waitress what that tasted like. The waitress responded \"It's a flavor of margarita that is called prickly pear\" (???) She was equally vague and unknowledgeable about a question my brother asked regarding their happy hour special. (Sidenote-do not order a whiskey and coke-it comes in a tiny odd-looking brandy glass) I wouldn't recommend the margarita either  3)  The food-Each member of our party ordered something different and all of us were disappointed. HORRIBLE. I thought for a $10 plate of enchaladas, I'd have to take some food home for leftovers, but my enchalada plate, and my husband's burrito were TINY and absolutely TASTELESS. SUPER BLAND and NO flavor at all. It was disgusting and I couldn't even eat it.   Would NOT recommend this place. With all the Mexican restaurants in the Madison area, I would definitely look elsewhere. Very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went to Tex Tubb's with a larger sized group -- about 8 -- for a small birthday celebration a little while back. Despite my review of two stars, let me start off by saying I think I was there on a bad day for service and they deserve a second chance. Our meal was an assortment of errors and mistakes, but despite that the food was good and portions were good. I think on a different night, we'd see something different.  I had the tamale special, which was tasty. However, I had ordered chicken and not pork. Not cool, but no big thing for me. The birthday girl's drink order went in and disappeared into a void. The time for food to come out of the kitchen was inordinately long. Personally, I thought our waitress was great and totally on top of things and the kitchen was just lost in the sauce that evening.   There were other errors, but most of them were not major...just a cluster of minors. The food was still good and I'll be back for a second visit. Hopefully they'll be better sorted by then."}
{"text":"Favorite taco joint in Madison, hands down. Great chips and salsa. Love the Backyard BBQ taco and the Chorizo & Black Bean taco. The enchiladas are delicious too. They've got my beloved Lone Star and Cholula always on hand.   The only downside is that their frozen margs might as well be N/A. I'd suggest upgrading to a Palace Margarita or sticking to beer.  All day Happy Hour Tuesday & Thursday."}
{"text":"Great food. The tacos in particular are really something. I've enjoyed exploring the different kinds of tacos."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here since it received a silver for best of Madison. Unfortunately the food was AWFUL. Nothing was hot. My girlfriend got tacos and there were cold. Cold shrimp and cold shrimp tacos. The flavor was fine but who wants cold tacos. I got the tamale special. Literally the worst Mexican food I have EVER HAD. It was a huge lump of bland DRY food. There was barely any chicken. The chicken was even SUPER dry. The only reason for 2 stars was that the drinks were cheap. NOT GOOD, just cheap. The service was bad as well. She didn't ask how the food was or how we were doing. I don't like being a grouch but it was honestly just the worst Mexican food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Nostalgia and familiarity is the reason why this place gets 4 stars instead of 3. I'm originally from the Austin, TX area and this place has done it proper...right down to the Joe Ely posters!   Unfortunately it took a long time to get our food but when the migas finally hit the table they proved to be somewhat worth the wait. The food was close to the typical tex-mex fare that you could find in Austin, but it was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"It kills me to give a Food Fight establishment 2.5 stars.  But the food was not very good.  I mean, it was fresh, but the flavor was kinda gross.  Had chips, guac, and queso.  Pretty standard, no real complaints except that I would expect more creativity from this restaurant brand.  The tacos though...I don't know what was up with the shell.  They were supposed to be soft shell corn tortillas, I thought mine were flour until I started on the second one, then thought maybe they were corn.  Whatever they were, they were so gross.  Now, the inside of the tacos were fine (portabella and spinach).  It was just hard to get past the weird-tasting shell.  I also had the jicama slaw, which was spicy yet flavorless.  I had to put a ton of salt and pepper on them.  I'd be willing to give this place one more try, but I'm not super confident that it will be better next time.  I think that's just how the food tastes.  On a side note, I used to frequent a quirky tex-mex place (not in Madison) that had the same vibe, but incredible food.  So it can be done."}
{"text":"Been there a few times and never had a bad taco.  Flavor combinations are amazing.  The pork belly taco is the best taco I have ever had."}
{"text":"Had my second visit to Tex's and it was better than the first. First visit was Tacos on a busy Friday. The sat me at the bar and the food and service was excellent. Went for lunch and had the enchiladas. The variety of items is awesome I had three different  enchiladas with three different sauces and the food was great. Can't go wrong at this place.They also have a great bar selection. Parking can be difficult but well worth it for a great meal."}
{"text":"Visiting my college roommate and she took us to this spot. Great tacos and really tasty Margaritas. Me and another friend both got the sampler- (the peach and the pear were our favorite flavors) super unique favors and you get a lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I got the giant burrito with pork. There was no cheese involved (maybe they ran out?) and it was on the cold side of warm. Not much flavor unless you add hot salsa. Very disappointing. I've had good experiences here but I just hate having a meal that wasn't customer considered or cared about the way I'd expect.  Update:  I took my parents here for dinner tonight. Although the place was really busy for a Sunday at 5 pm, we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Service was good and mom and dad enjoyed their food. Mine was good, too. The only thing we didn't like were the black beans. They were very... bitter. Mom had tacos, dad had sweet potato enchiladas and I had steak fajitas. Dad cleaned his plate and part of mine. No surprise. For a man so tall and trim, he'll win an eating contest any day.  Pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"I am a bit of a regular. Quality Americanized Mexican food. Big fan of the green salsa and carnitas tacos. Sweet potato fries are also good. Annoying that they charge for chips now."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food, nice drinks, and lone star beer. You can saunter up to the salsa bar and load up. Always a good time.  Good to see them doing events in the parking lot over summer."}
{"text":"Chicken Fajitas and salsa bar were great! Nice vibe, as always from the Food Fight group. I wasn't blown away by the food but will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Adventurous appetites need apply! If you want taco night at your mom's house, it's not on the menu. You will find creative flavor combinations swaddled in a luke warm tortilla. My personal favorite is the Southern Fried Chicken taco; Fried chicken, sweet potato hash, sautéed Swiss chard, and chipotle sour cream. Their margarita menu is extensive. Their frito burrito IS bigger than your head, but I think that's somebody else's slogan. Nestled in a hip neighborhood and surrounded by at least 2 great breweries, Tex Tubb's is a great place to start your evening!"}
{"text":"Had been driving in the area and noticed this place.  Decided to stop and try it out for ourselves.  It was a wonderful meal and visit.  This will now be a new stop for us.  The service was amazing, the selection of craft beers was awesome, and the food itself was outstanding!  They had over 15  unique speacialty tacos....  my wife and I both tried 3 different ones...  i had the bbq beef brisket (our favorite), the fish taco and a cauliflower taco.  She had a bbq pork taco, carne asada, and a fried chicken with sweet potato hash.......  yummy... Also they had great salsa that you could go up and help yourself too at a buffet bar.  Great Margeritas! Stop and see for yourself!  We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm from Milwaukee and was meeting a friend.  I had good expectations since they have good reviews.  I'm not sure why they have such good reviews....  I ordered the 3 taco dinner and rice and beans.  Nothing was hot.  One of the tacos tasted good and was warm, only because of the queso on it.  The other two tacos and the rice and beans had no flavor or spices to them whatsoever.  My friend ordered a burrito and the beans.  She said her burrito tasted okay but it was not hot either.  Pretty sad when the queso from the chips and salsa appetizer was the best thing there.  Multiple people brought our food to the table and not once did our waitress (or anyone) come back to ask how the food was, not even when she brought the bill.  I could understand if they were really busy and maybe having an off night but there were only 3 other tables of people on our side and it was not that busy.  There are many other great places to try in Madison but I will never be going back to this one."}
{"text":"In my younger years, I walked out of a many of restaurants, in Madison, and elsewhere.  But I honestly cannot recall walking out of anyplace, anywhere, in the past 20 years.  The change is likely as much a result my better behavior, as it is in less surly service and better food when eating out.  Well, Tex Tubb's, you got me today.  I promise, I didn't make a scene.  It's Sunday and I stopped about 12:30 by to pick up a few tacos to take home for lunch after doing morning weekend work at my office.  When I arrived, there were a total of three other customers in the restaurant.  Two were sitting at the bar, appearing to be finishing breakfast and margaritas.  The third person was a young woman picking up a to-go order.  As soon as I sat down at the bar, the waitress and the to-go order gal got into a very extended \"discussion\" over a 30 cent discrepancy in the bill.  It took three or four readings of the menu and the same number of reviews of the bill for what appeared to be a possible resolution.     As that little tiff was winding down with the first payment of the bill, the phone started ringing and the manager materialized from places unknown.  She went behind the bar, and took an extended  telephone order.  As soon as she was done with that, she went back to to-go girl and engaged in yet another extended discussion which resulted in re-running the debit or credit card with a 30 cent credit.   Meanwhile, the first waitress disappeared.  Customers started coming in.  Another waitress appeared.  But still not even a greeting for me.  Since I am now a mature diner, I told myself to sit tight, they would get my order in and I would be on my way quickly.  After all, for a good 10-15 minutes, I was the only person physically present in the place who wanted to place an order.    But, no.  Manager finally came over and gave me a menu and I ordered a soda as that seemed doable.  Then manager disappeared never to be seen again.  Many customers were coming in.  Looked like lots were coming from the Trek ride on the Square.  Waitresses 1 & 2 were having a hard time deciding which tables they were going to wait on, but, for sure, they were not going to take my order.  One guy from an early arrival table was literally chasing one of the waitresses to come and take an order as it was easy to see now what was going on.  So, I just got up and left.  Not sure anyone saw me.   I am sure no one cared.  I agree with many of the reviewers that the quality of the food took a nosedive some time ago.  It's never as good as it once was but I would say you get good decent food about 70% if the time.  If you get the right bartender, they will make you a really fine Patron silver margarita on the rocks.  I will tip them 15% on a to-go order just for that.  The fresh salsa bar is a choice amenity.  No chance for a margarita today.  No need for the salsa bar.  One star today.  Maybe the metrics work for you here, Kevin, but you gotta do better than this, at least that's MHO."}
{"text":"Palace margaritas are good, super good really. Food is somewhat pricey but good. My fav is the brisket torta, soooooo good and fattening"}
{"text":"Nothing terribly exciting here. I had the chicken fajita, as did a friend, and we both agreed that it was rather bland. If anything it actually tasted pretty awful. My partner on the other hand had the Atwood burrito and he couldn't stop raving about it. To each his own. Their margaritas kept me happy, though. Oh! We did get free chips and salsa for checking in thanks to good 'ole Yelp! So that helped some."}
{"text":"Great drinks and great food. And they're very cool with kids (we have a 2 year old and I'm pregnant with yet another). Relaxed, nice atmosphere. and LOCAL cuisine. What's there not to love?"}
{"text":"Really great fillings for the corn tacos,  wish they would grill the tacos or cast iron pan fry (instead of microwave!)  still excellent fillings and salsas!! :-)"}
{"text":"Do your mouth a favor and get the brisket taco. Best taco I have had in Madison. The restaurant itself is cute, the wait staff was friendly and the service was quick. There were a lot of different options and I had trouble just choosing a few tacos. I will definitely be back again for more."}
{"text":"Simply the best.  Stopped in randomly ( I'm not from Madison) and was so thrilled!  Good eats, awesome atmosphere, well organized and I loved that I couldn't make up my mind - so many options!  Stop in here if you haven't, you will be well satisfied."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and adorable atmosphere!  I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time since I moved to Madison.  It's a spot for sharing stories from the week over a monster margarita.  Just enjoy yourself and take pride in the mega enchilada you just ate.  (Also, lots of veggie and vegan options!)"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Tex-Amex place in Madison.   Great atmosphere and vibe inside and the Texas flags are awesome. Good size and diverse selection of tables. Service is great and usually very fast.   The queso is very good. We love it. The chips are actually not fantastic. They taste very similar to those you could buy at a grocery store--Tostitos. So not great actually. Wish they would get a different kind or serve them a little warm. Would help make this a 5 star review.   The food is always very good. The tacos are excellent and the quesadillas are great. Our kids love the kids food and especially the rice.   Drinks are very good. Palace margarita is a good one. They have Texas beers available there--Lone star and Shiner Bock and that is awesome!  Great spot!"}
{"text":"New to Madison and very hard to find good Mexican food!  The carne asada tacos are no joke!  Simply amazing with the perfect amount of Texan kick.  Service from Payton was excellent, she definitely knew the menu!!! We'll be back for sure.."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good drinks, and good food. I enjoy the atmosphere.  Try the cauliflower tacos! Even meat lovers should grab one of these, very satisfying"}
{"text":"Never ending chips and salsa bar: one of the many reasons Tex Tubb's is always at the top of my list when I'm hungry or looking for a happy hour place to go. Great chips and a bar with 4 salsas that range in spiciness and flavor. As a salsa enthusiast, their spiciest option packs a respectable punch. Paired with a range of well-made cocktails--especially the Moscow Mule--it's a great place to come during the week for happy hours.  For more substantial fooding, it has great taco options, even for vegetarians (which is sometimes a hard find). Tons of variation ranging from squash to backyard BBQ, with all meats and lots of non-meats represented. My favorite are the fried avocado tacos and pork and pineapple and blackened tilapia are phenomenal. Because the tacos are so good, some other options get short shrift,  but the Tortas are also top-notch.   On weekend nights the wait for tables tends to be a little long and the small bar gets packed pretty quickly, so don't come starving. But most other nights the place is full, but not crowded. Most things can also be made gluten free and vegan."}
{"text":"I've been to Tex Tubb's Taco Palace many times - how did I never do a review?  First - it has Palace in the name...which is a selling point for me!  I have never been disappointed here and last night was no exception.  This place is awesome - they have a great vibe - trendy without pretentious - subtle yet absurd.  You can't go wrong with the tacos.  As a matter of fact last night I had my favorite to date which was the Chipotle braised beef taco.  YUM!!!  Do yourself a favor and step out of that national chain restaurant and head over to TTTP - they are part of the Food Fight *locally* owned group.  You won't be disappointed (unless you don't like really good tacos then you might be ; )"}
{"text":"Have been twice so far. Decent meal. Not spectacular but not bad either. Guacamole was WAY overpriced for the amount you get. And it's a bit annoying that you've got to pay for the chips. Not a huge fan of the salsa's there. Only three salsas available the evening I went, but was hoping for more, given we had to pay to get chips to dip into them!"}
{"text":"spicy salsa bar fits the east side attitude margaritatas"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food in town. Great prices, great high quality ingredients, and just overall good.  Kid friendly, funky atmosphere, great beer selection.  I like the pork and chorizo tacos the best."}
{"text":"This place was not bad, actually it was consistently good over two separate visits. Sitting at the bar proved a more enjoyable and better service experience than sitting at a table, as I usually find to be the case. I enjoyed all the meat tacos, with fried fish options being superior to grilled.  I would recommend any of them. I would also recommend the cauliflower I really like that one."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've ever had. The best one was the brussel sprouts taco (I know, hard to believe). Will go again and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite establishment in the Atwood area, which is saying a lot if you know how great the Atwood area can be. Here are all the reasons that TT won me over:  1. Free Chips & Salsa (with a check in offer via the Yelp app) 2. A salsa bar, so you can dip those chips in 4 different types of salsa. My favorite is the green one for sure. 3. Great (albeit small) rotating tap selection of craft & local brews. You'll always get something good. 4. A good variety of margaritas. You can either stay with the basics, go fancy, or try an interesting flavor. 5. The tacos. There's a good variety of unique choices to be had, including a sweet potato one, a veggie tostada, and a fried avocado one. 6. The burritos, especially the Schenk's Corner. One of the rare times I feel full after eating a burrito while NOT also feeling gluttonous. 7. Vegan nachos vegan nachos VEGAN NACHOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 8. A decent spot to get brunch on the weekends as it's tasty and not very crowded. 9. The menu is constantly evolving. Since I started going regularly, i've run into numerous new items that I've adored.  If these points don't sell you to come check it out, then I don't know what to tell you."}
{"text":"We had so much fun here, & the food wasnt half bad either ;) Four of us, mostly orders taco platters. Tried a variety of different flavors, but the clear winner was the chorizo & black bean taco. Chorizo on the spicier side, so delicious! Jicama slaw was good as well, although needed some seasoning (& a dash of hot sauce!) Salsas were yummy, especially the Verde. Our server was nice & attentive. Only suggestion I have is either get different margarita pitchers, or just serve the ice on the side. Impossible to pour without making a mess. Thanks Tex Tubbs for a memorable dinner!"}
{"text":"Was hesitant to go in the first place, given it's a Food Fight restaurant but decided, what the heck. Ordered two tacos from the platter option, the Pork Belly taco which lists the pork belly as being crispy, it was anything but, and cold. The other taco was the House Smoked Pork, but had no smokey flavor whatsoever. Perhaps they should do some tweaking to their menu. Staff was friendly and efficient. But I will not return."}
{"text":"I'm between two and three stars. I had the fish tacos and I have to say I prefer Pasqual's. He had the tacos, which I think he liked. And you have to pay for chips and salsa! :("}
{"text":"As many have noted, this is NOT the place to go if you're looking for authentic Mexican food. That being said - my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal there & really liked the fresh spin on the ordinary taco.   The only bummer (and a very small bummer) was the chips & salsa. They charge $1 for tortilla chips while most Mexican restaurants would include them for free. Not exactly a bank-breaker, but something to consider. The fact that you get to go to a little salsa bar and pick which kind you want with your chips is an inspired idea, although it would be great to see them expand their 4 salsa choices to possibly include a pico de gallo, or even a corn salsa.  2 of the salsa choices tasted like tomatoes with not much else, one tasted like salty tomatoes, and the green salsa tasted like tomatoes with sugar. This was probably the least-enjoyable part of our dining experience but it's only chips & salsa - not a deal breaker.   While they do sell other things besides tacos, my husband and I decided to stick with the namesake and order 3 tacos each. I ordered 2 vegetarian tacos: roasted sweet potato with swiss chard, and roasted veggies with ancho queso fresco & fried carrots, as well as a Cob-O-Wabo (Basically a cobb salad in a tortilla). All 3 of my tacos tasted delicious, but my favorites were definitely the vegetarian tacos. Delicious flavor, veggies were perfectly cooked & it was fun to try something different. Although I am not a vegetarian, I would highly recommend that vegetarians check this place out.  My husband had a Hot Mama (basically a buffalo chicken wrap), The Pickler (he said he imagines this is what a McDonald's Big Mac Snack Wrap tastes like) and a Jalapeno & Apple Sausage taco. He said all were really good, but he would probably not order the buffalo chicken wrap again simply because it wasn't all that different from something he could get somewhere else.   While the tacos were good, the service was even better. Our server was running around like crazy as we were there on a Friday night, but our drinks were never less than 1/4 full and he checked in often and was very helpful as we were navigating the menu. I wish I could remember his name to give him proper credit.   All in all - definitely something different & fun to try. I think this is a place we'd bring out of town guests to try something different as it screams \"Madison\" to me with its funky colors and unique menu."}
{"text":"Good and friendly service. Had taco salad which was good. Nice salsa bar. Nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"Worst bowl of tortilla soup EVER.  Smallest, most expensive tacos EVER!  Seriously, why not just go to Taco Bell?  You'll be just as satisfied, with more money left in your wallet."}
{"text":"As a long-time fan of the Tex Tubb's on Atwood, I went into the University Ave. location expecting the same thing, but with a west-Madison twist. I was wrong. I really missed the crazy mismatched metal tables and chairs, and the back room with the 8-track player. I also missed the salsa bar. A lot. So in order to do this other, not-so-cool-distant-cousin-type Tex Tubbs justice, I'm going to forget all of the things I love about the Atwood location and look at the University Ave. location for what it is. And what it is is a really nice Tex-Mex restaurant with an inventive menu that has something for everyone (they even have a grilled cheese sandwich with a tex-mex flare... more about that later).  We got the nachos with pulled chicken as an appetizer. And I have to hand it to the folks at Food Fight, Inc., they rival even the Great Dane's impressive nachos. The jalapenos were very, very weak though. It was definitely a super-cheesy and tame midwestern version of nachos. But it was huge and quite tasty regardless of its mild nature. They used black beans on it, which was a very nice touch.  I got a \"cup\" of soup to start my meal. And I use quotes because it was the largest \"cup\" I've ever seen. The chili had steak and beef in it, and was topped with tortilla shreds and sour cream. I would imagine the \"bowl\" would be more than enough for an entire meal. As far as taste goes, it was served a bit cooler than I would like a soup or chili to be served, but it did taste like a good, solid, midwestern chili. Again, they could have turned up the spice quite a bit.  As an entree I got their tex-mex version of a Cobb Salad, which consisted of salad greens tossed with a really, really tangy and tasty vinaigrette and topped with monterrey jack cheese, avocado slices, pulled chicken, and corn chowder. I think the highlight of the entire meal was the dressing, though I liked the inventiveness of their Cobb-inspired dish.  My friend got the $8.00 grilled cheese sandwich, which is supposed to come with fries, but for some reason they ran out of fries (how does that happen??), so he settled for a \"cup\" of chili for an extra charge. The grilled cheese came out with fried pickles (I will never understand that fad), and featured texas toast, melted monterrey jack cheese, and guacamole. I didn't try it, but my friend wasn't impressed, especially with the $8.00 price tag. Though, to be fair, I warned him about getting a grilled cheese sandwich at a tex-mex restaurant. He said the guac was an interesting twist, but he didn't seem like he was too into it.  Another interesting point was that they actually have a really well equipped bar. One of my friends actually asked for a PBR Tallboy (because he's classy like that) and they had exactly what he wanted.  The University Ave. location was a decent meal, but I'm not sure I'd go there over the Atwood location. I left finding myself wishing I had been able to tap into that wonderful salsa bar. The dishes were very inventive and the portion sizes were definitely midwestern which is sure to please any Madisonite, but there isn't much that would leave me saying \"I love this place.\" Though the service was a bit better here than the Atwood location."}
{"text":"Fun, relaxed vibe and tasty food I'd describe as tex-mex with a twist (not authentic Mexican).  Definitely order the chips and check out the salsa bar which has mild, medium and hot options.  Plus, the visit to the salsa bar will kill a bit of time while you wait for your drinks. The drinks always take TOO long to come, even if we just order a couple of beers. Hmmph."}
{"text":"I am obsessed.  Now, truthfully, this is not the BEST taco I have ever had but this is one of the best tacos in town. Before you start getting snarky, I did not say the best traditional taco but the best taco.    I was there on Thursday for all day Happy Hour. I ordered a mango margarita.  It was ok. Nothing spectacular. Honestly, I am glad I only had to pay $3 for it.  Now the food?  Awesome. There is a self serve salsa bar. I ordered the tradional Carne Asada taco and the El Cubano (slow cooked pork) taco with rice and black beans. The two taco platter is so big.  The food was fresh, hot and the flavors all really worked well together. There are about ten tacos to choose from for the the platter. There are also numerous other entree options.   This is a great group or date place."}
{"text":"Maybe I've been spoiled by Belair Cantina too many times but the food and service here were disappointing.  We ordered three tacos and drinks.  We got the tacos first.  They were big but overly sauced and the protein was even room temperature.  They have a salsa bar which seems like a fun idea, but they don't even give you chips and salsa as a starter for free.  Belair gives you that and three awesome sauces.  Their tacos might be smaller but they're way better.  The sweet potato fries were the only good thing I had on my plate. And those drinks we ordered?  They never came, and never showed up on the bill.  Weird.  They just screwed themselves out of 20 bucks and a good Yelp review.  My advice?  Go to Belair Cantina, you'll get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"We've eaten here three or four times over the past two years and we like it. The tacos are delicious, the salsa is good, and the service has always been decent. Most recently I tried the Frito burrito and I liked it. They also have great queso. Bummer that they charge for chips n salsa, but it's just that kind of place. Not my favorite for Mexican style food, as it's more Tex-Mex, but I like it occasionally. Have never witnessed any signs of bad service or a dirty restaurant like other reviewers."}
{"text":"Fantastic.   I was skeptical based on some reviews.  We gave it a shot for Valentine's Day.   I don't enjoy paying for chips, but in combo with queso and guac it's not so bad. The guac is amazing and the salsa bar was ok. I do however think a salsa bar would have more than 4 options, right?  Doesn't a bar make you think there are multiple choices and by multiple I mean more than 4?    That being said, our tacos were great.  I hate sweet potato fries, but being an adventerous eater I tried them.  I LOVED them, it was the sea salt and the made to order piece that did it, I'm sure.    Thursday all day happy hour is a deal. I recommend the prickly pear on the rocks, peach frozen and the cherry frozen.   Service - attentive courteous and knowledgeable about the food and menu."}
{"text":"Ate here 2 times in 48 hours. I see a lot of people are underwhelmed about this place, but you can't go wrong with the Wil-Mar Burrito. The combination of fried avocado and feta cheese was out of this world along with the mushrooms in it. Maybe I was just very hungry those two days, but I found it to be absolutely great.   The prices were great as well (less than $10), and I was very full when I left."}
{"text":"Seriously blows Belair out of the water if you're familiar with the Milwaukee area. Go for the tacos! All were superb and the staff is super down to earth"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food?  Check.  Cheap Mexican food?  Check.  Delicious margaritas?  Check.  Friendly service?  Check.  The *only* thing I kinda-sorta didn't like (but it was by no means a buzzkill) was that the margaritas weren't served in margarita glasses, but rather, rocks glasses.  Oh well.  I love Tex Tubbs!"}
{"text":"If I would have written this review 4 years ago it might have been 4-5 stars.  It seems TTTP is losing its focus on quality.    For starters, the salsa bar now offers el-cheap-o cups, while it doesn't affect quality, it takes away from the experience.  But on to the salsa.  Maybe the recipes were changed, maybe a bad year for tomatoes but the flavor is nowhere what it used to be, was it a cost cutting measure? Chips:  I seem to recall \"in-house\" made chips, the chips we had did not seem to be fresh.  Taco's - not bad, I miss the à La Carte and the hard shells.  They seemed to have gone over the top too, no such thing as just a 'classic' taco.  $8 for a margarita on the rocks? steep, even by Madison standards.  Overall, I'm sad.  I loved coming here, but it's off my radar now."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos! Kind of pricey but our waiter gave us free chips and salsa, so that was nice (I  thought they charged for chips n salsa?) I will definitely return,  cool atmosphere and I like the fact that you can mix and match your tacos. It was about  $35 for the two of us, including 2 beers."}
{"text":"This was my first time here after hearing so much about it. I really loved it and cant wait to go again. My friend and I got a pitcher of the prairie fire margarita..it was spicy , but really worth it, we also got a flight, which I'm use to beers having flights, but margaritas are even better. You get 3 different kinds(your choice) and its a good amount, in my opinion a good buy. We had chips and salsa and there was 4 different kinds hat you can choose from.. I like #3 the best, I didn't try the hottest as the margarita spice was still in my throat. We had the fried avocado which is AWESOME, the Avacado Frito..and the Wil-Mar Burrito, both amazing and enough that we both had leftovers. Being from Texas I wasn't a big fan that I had to pay for chips and salsa, but besides that it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to re-visit Tex Tubb's and I will say the service was outstanding as compared to my previous visit.  And in full disclosure, I was contacted by a manager from Tex's with an apology for the poor service, which I did appreciate.  I went with a friend who got a beef burrito; we both thought the flavor was great, with a little kick to it.  I will definitely try the burrito next visit.  I went with a couple of tacos, which were okay.  The sweet potato fries were outstanding.  Overall, very nice visit and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch, as I have been wanting to try this place out for a while.  Checked in, with Yelp, and got myself a free basket of warm tortilla chips (yes, they aren't free-I think they are $3.99).  They have a salsa bar so you go up and help yourself to 3 different types of salsas they have. One is a mild, tomato based salsa, one is a spicier green salsa, and finally a spicy tomato based salsa, which was spicy but not overly so.  I ordered the 3 taco dinner.  I had the carnitas taco, the al pastor taco and the steak and salsa verde taco.  As my side I chose the pickled vegetables.  First off, the pickled vegetables were great-spicy and flavorful with a good mix of veggies.  A great take on the standard Mexican pickled veg.  The al pastor taco was really good, if not a bit sweet.  The steak and salsa verde taco rocked!  The carnitas taco was good, but the carnitas tasted a bit old and greasy.  Not bad, just not nearly the best carnitas I have every eaten.  It was late afternoon and the place was rather slow so I was surprised at how slow my service was, but I will say that my server was very friendly and helpful.  Overall, a good experience and I look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"I had previously rated the Atwood location, and given it 3 stars because of the uniformly terrible service.  I have since eaten at the University Ave location.  ALWAYS GO TO THE UNIVERSITY AVE LOCATION.  Avoid the Atwood one--you'll sit there with an empty margarita glass for 20 minutes while the servers ignore you.  I love their fish tacos, particularly the shrimp ones.  I haven't eaten anything there that wasn't pretty good.  Coming from Missouri, I don't assume that I'll get corn tortillas without asking, but I can understand being annoyed about getting flour as the default.  The food is really good, and at the University Ave location, the service is excellent--we were seated immediately, our waitress was extremely attentive, and I was amazed at the speed with which our entrees were served."}
{"text":"The neon sign at this place lured me in and the good food and atmosphere kept me there! I recommend the \"El Pastor and Pineapple\" taco on the taco platter- great flavor, especially for people who like things like Hawaiian pizza. Chips were good and you get to choose your own salsa at the salsa bar! Beans and rice seemed better than most places to me. I'm impressed! The place is fun; go with a date or a big group! Tacos for all!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here again on my recent business trip.  I went on a Thursday night because I know it's just too packed on the weekends.  I decided it's not worth 5 stars, but this is Madison (not Austin or south side LA where even the taco trucks get 5 stars).  I ate at the bar, the service is friendly and if you go during the week it's efficient.  I had 3 tacos and tbh they were a bit greasy (pork and steak) and I had to add some spice with the pickled veggies which were my side.  I'll go back but NEVER on the weekend - not worth it.   I heard the chef/cook is from Austin.  Maybe he needs to go back for a quick refresher?"}
{"text":"I don't understand why Tex Tubb's isn't at least 4 stars.  They have a lot of fun Tex-Mex menu items with big portions too. Service is friendly and informative. They have a salsa bar with 4 awesome salsas and gourmet hot sauces at your table. The drink selection is solid and reasonably priced.  I'm a fan of their \"chimi'd\" Frito burrito which has beans, fried chicken, beans, and Fritos. Honestly, it's pretty unsophisticated, but I do love fried chicken and fried avocados covered in my favorite salsas.  They have a wide variety of tacos. If you're looking for authentic Mexican tacos, this isn't for you. If you like barbecued and slow-cooked meats, you'll love them. My favorites are the chipotle-braised beef, el cubano, and backyard bbq.  The best side dish is hands down the fried avocados. Usually, avocados are prepared and enjoyed cold or room temperature, so this is a pretty unique way to enjoy avocados. You'll be surprised by how good they are, especially with bbq sauce."}
{"text":"I'm kinda loving this place.  My family is in Madison on vacation and we always travel with our lil' vegetarian so we are always on the lookout for vegetarian-friendly places.  After reading about Tex Tubb's and passing it earlier on in the day, we decided to give it a try.  We were so glad we did.  Lil' Vegetarian tried the black bean flautas.  They were quite good - crispy on the outside and then grilled, keeping the inside hot and creamy. The guacamole served with the flautas was a little on the too-citrusy side to enjoy.  I had Elisa's choice taco - probably one of the best vegetarian tacos I have ever eaten.  I never would have thought to deep fry an avocado, but really, it works.  Trust me.  My husband had the beef tacos and the fried catfish taco.  I had a taste of the fish taco.  It was crispy and topped with a crunchy cabbage slaw that was very good.  The salsa bar had four choices of salsa.  Nothing overly exciting but all of them were certainly tasty.  Two of us decided to add beans and rice for an additional $1.98.  It was different than your usual beans and rice.  The refried beans were far better than the black beans but both were tasty.  Next time, I'll skip the rice.  It was okay, but nothing to write home about.  The beans were ample enough to fill me up anyway :)  We had a very nice server.  She was having trouble with two of her tables shortly after we got there but she remained calm, cool and level-headed.  When asked, she had a suggestion for a local custard shop for us to try, but that is another review.  Good service, tasty food - we'll be back.  Oh, another reviewer said the price was high, I disagree, three dinners, three drinks, $40 - not bad at all."}
{"text":"I always get the shredded beef burrito. This is the best burrito in Madison, WI, and it's not even close. So if you want a great beef burrito and you live in Madison, eat here."}
{"text":"Only been once... won't be back.  I really really really wanted some fish tacos and they are fairly close so we tried it out.  We eat out with our baby a lot (she is under one) so we go at odd hours (to annoy less people), so keep that in mind (they probably didn't have their A game on).    Drinks were meh and the tacos were AWFUL.  I feel like I would have been better off going to taco bell (they don't have fish tacos but I would have felt more satisfied by eating their bad Mexican food than I did by eating Tex Tubb's fish tacos).  I consulted with the waiter about my fish tacos (you have four options) and decided to try the Achiote Tilapia, Fried Catfish and Marinated Shrimp.  Shrimp was overcooked, the Tilapia was ... well, the Achiote seasoning is all burn and no flavor, but it's not even that hot! (and it's on almost everything on the menu, which is why I'm not excited to give them another try)  The Catfish was the best but that isn't saying much.   Service was pretty good though!"}
{"text":"The staff is incredible. The veggie tacos are original and delicious. The atmosphere is very hip. I love the music. Great salsa bar.  Another of my \"when in Madison we gotta go to\" top choices."}
{"text":"Awesome place with amazing vegan options. I'm obsessed with the vegan nachos. I've had their black bean flautas, sweet potato enchiladas, most of the vegan taco options, and a vegan chimi style burrito and have loved them all. However, the vegan nachos are still my favorite menu item. Very rich... I once refused to eat them until my waitress came back because I was convinced the creamy sauce on them was dairy. (It wasn't.) The prairie fire margarita is delicious, and very spicy. And the staff are always super nice!"}
{"text":"Fantastic nontraditional tacos but with a small and busy space. The food here is a creative American take on Mexican cuisine. It's worth checking out, but you will either need to plan to visit during non-peak hours or brace yourself for a wait (sometimes an extreme wait).  I have visited Tex Tubb's three times now, and the food has been top notch on all visits. The chipotle pulled pork tacos are off the wall. They have a perfect balance of spice and flavor. Make sure you take full of advantage of the salsa bar, but be warned that you can easily fill up on chips and salsa if the night is busy (food can take awhile).  Tex Tubb's is extremely small, and its reputation has out grown its space. They either need a second location or need to expand. Waits can be long and excruciating, and they do not take reservations. Whenever I walk by Tex Tubb's during peak hours the place is crammed from wall to wall.  My first visit to Tex Tubb's was mildly frustrating due to a nearly 2 hour wait. My following visits had little to no wait due to arrival before peak hours. On both days, the restaurant was full by 6pm.  After my frustrating visit, my wife and I returned alone on date night. We were seated immediately and split a taco platter. The food was a slow in coming out, but the quality of the tacos was on par and worth the wait.  Full disclosure, our 3rd visit was partially compensated (free guac and drinks) by management due to our first experience with the two hour wait. We appreciated the hospitality and still ordered full dinners. In no way was this review impacted by the free items. I already planned on revisiting the review after the visit with my wife.  I still feel that management needs to reconsider their policy on not allowing big group reservations outlined in my first review. I still recommend passing on Tex Tubb's if you have a group during peak business hours."}
{"text":"This review is solely for the food, as we did carry out. The inside of the restaurant looked pretty neat, though, so we'll have to come back to dine in. I got the two taco platter with the crispy tilapia and the pastor/pineapple and they were both to die for!! They were stuffed absolutely full with plenty of meat veggies and salsa/guac. Also came with small sides of rice and beans. Definitely a filling meal, and decently priced. They have a lot of really unique-sounding tacos and you can pick and choose any two or three to fill your platter. I can't wait to go back and try more! My dining companion had the taco salad which was also quite delicious and pretty good sized. Only complaint I have is that the front of the place where you wait to be seated/helped is pretty small, and we did have to wait maybe two or three minutes before we were noticed by staff (but our food was ready right away). Overall we will definitely carry out again and will hopefully be back to eat in."}
{"text":"Tex Tubb's is a great Mexican/taco spot on Willie Street! Went on a Friday night around 7pm so had to wait. Luckily there was some seating at the bar so I was able to grab a drink while waiting.  I enjoy the fact you can mix and match a variety of tacos. I had the braised beef and el Cubano with a side of sweet potato fries. My fiance and I also split a pitcher of Margarita.   Everything was delicious and I would highly suggest anyone who likes Mexican to try this place out!"}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is decorated so uniquely, we really enjoyed it's ambiance. We walked past a salsa bar when we were seated. The waitstaff asked if we wanted to start with any chips and salsa which we said yes (they charge ~$3 but seemed unlimited). I had a frozen peach margarita which was very tasty. For dinner I had the Frito Burrito which was a giant burrito stuffed with your choice of fried chicken or fried avocado. served with rice, corn salsa, chili meat sauce, and frito's. doused with chili meat sauce and queso. served with a side of slaw, pico, and sour cream all for $8.95. I thought this burrito was absolutely delicious. It was also so big that I took half of it home and ate it the next day. My husband has the Chorizo And Egg Torta which consisted of chorizo, egg, tomato salsa, crema, lettuce, onions, and jack cheese for $9.99 and is served with a side (he chose sweet potato fries). He said his Torta was good but then it got pretty hot. Which he normal likes spicy and hot so I thought his comment wasn't like him, must have been pretty hot!  We loved the food here and we would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Considering this would have to be one of if not the busiest nights of the year with the street festival happening literally right in front of the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to get a table right away this Saturday night.   Surprise #2! After several attempts at checking in on the Yelp app, I made it in! Not sure if this joint has wifi but honestly, it's not that kind of joint. So stay off your phone after redeeming the Yelp free food offer! (And thanks Tex Tubbs for the grub!)  Our server took the chips and drink order about 5 minutes after we sat. And the taco platters (with tasty black beans and rice sides) arrived 5 minutes later! I appreciate the kitchen was working fast because I can only imagine they were slammed all weekend.  While the basic chicken taco could have used more flavor, and the pineapple and chicken with coconut was seriously devoid of pineapple, these are correctable issues by diner or kitchen. One comes to Tex Tubbs to make choices from an entire page of meat, seafood, and vegetarian tacos, fully customizable platters. Add plenty of gluten sensitive options, salads, and other entrées and it's just a place you need to try!  We were thanked for our business by our server and the hostess so keep that up TT!  -Shouting to be heard by my table mate.  Weird restroom placement.  Not really any privacy. Tables right on top of each other. If those don't bug you then this might be your 5 star next stop!  P.S. Tex Tubbs, please bring back a west side location! Including breakfast!"}
{"text":"After joining a few friends for tacos this weekend, I'd have to say I'm a fan of Tex Tubb's. I had only been here once before on a whim several years ago for the brunch menu. That time, I felt a little rushed, and just ordered the first thing I saw that sounded okay off the menu board behind the counter. That's what I got. Okay.    The layout has since changed, and I appreciated the time I was given to look over the extensive choices. I was told that the tilapia tacos were great, so I ordered the blackened variety and wasn't disappointed. I also had a fried catfish and carne asada taco as well. The catfish was very good(but not as good as the tilapia), but the carne left something to be desired. They just didn't have the great flavor that it's fishy companions did...I didn't mind all that much, because I felt about to burst halfway into that third and final taco. I'm not sure what kind of stomach the previous Yelper has, but my Fish tacos were quite filling, and not at all tiny!   Each taco was around $3, not too bad in my opinion(and next time I'll only order two).   The salsa bar is also a plus(although \"bar\" is giving it too much credit, it's a sink w/four salsas). The verde was tangy and fresh!   We live closer to the University Ave location, so that's an excuse to try THAT one next!"}
{"text":"I DID go again(for brunch this time), and tried something else like I had suggested to myself.  I don't know what it is about the west side location, but I just don't love it. The breakfast burrito I had was decent, but nothing stood out. His chorizo scramble was okay, as well...but we've had better at the El Dorado many times. This isn't a bad place, but it's not top on my list."}
{"text":"Greetings, fellow taco lovers! I originally hail from California so I know super amazing, crazy authentic Mexican food. Having said that, I have 2 pieces of really good news. #1: Tex Tubb's is NOT a Mexican restaurant so I won't be comparing it to anything back in Cali and #2: They've created some seriously kick ass, super fun, tasty tacos that I will go back for time & time again.  Yes, the taco salad is fine and the black bean flautas are good. But the tacos, my friends, for me, the tacos are where it's at. Tonight I had the pork belly taco for the first time and it had everything - crispy pork belly, bright flavors, unique, light, balanced. I can't wait to have it again. The original carne asada taco is my main go to. I always get a great taco when I order the carne asada. The fish tacos are also fabulous, you can't go wrong.   The salsa bar makes me so happy. I really love it - it's kind of brilliant to have such fun variety along with a serve yourself option  And the queso dip, OMG! Stop it!!! I could make a meal of just that & the salsa/chips. AND the palace margaritas are wonderful! There's a lot to love at Tex Tubb's including the great service of all the hardworking staff (thanks, Matt Fanale)! I'll be back soon. I'm sure I'll see you there."}
{"text":"I end up here once a month - mostly drawn by the lovely cocktails. Service is slow and the menu has grown stale. No lunch menu, which is a bummer."}
{"text":"A wild departure from what our first experience was.   Service - We came for lunch and were seated almost immediately. Our order was taken promptly which was good. The next 30 mins was dead air. Our food didn't come and no one came by with any reasoning. After a while, our server comes by saying they lost our order and were making it again. A rather nonchalant Sorry was thrown in there for good measure I guess. No \"can we get anything for you while you wait....\". Our food finally came and yet another nonchalant sorry.   Food - We ordered the 2 taco platter combos for both of us. The El Pastor and Tequila Lime Shrimp for her and Smoked Brisket and Roasted Pork for me. Here's the kicker - both the El Pastor and Roasted Pork lacked the MOST important thing, Salt. We literally had to sprinkle salt to make our food edible. It's been years since I've had to do that so was disappointed to say the least.  The Tequila Lime Shrimp was OK with the shrimp over cooked but atleast seasoning was there.   My Smoked Brisket was my star the last time. This time however, tables turned. I did ask them to remove the Hot sauce as it was too spicy for me last time. However, what I was given were more like super Oily Burnt Ends with overcooked and chewy meat tied onto them. Again omission of seasoning so one could only taste Oil.  The only saving grace for us were the slightly soggy Sweet Potato fries. Best of the worst I guess.  Overall the food felt Rushed as they wanted to get it out to us asap. I'd like to chalk this up to maybe a bad day but the bad service and bad food combination really dampened our spirits. I'd mull over a little more before planning another trip here."}
{"text":"is there anything in life the vegan nachos at tex tubb's wouldn't make better, i wonder? yesterday, i put it to the test......  i came out of a job interview with my head ready to explode and when i looked up into the heavens and asked, what do i need? show me where to go....  tex tubb's was the answer. ahhhh....yes.  if i was norman and i had a cheers, this could be it.   i just needed a soft place to land, with pretty colored lights strung around window sills, tattoed (and cute) servers and a nice little bar that didn't have a tv blaring in my face or some guy 'hey babying' me.....and more pretty colored lights.  the retro chairs helped take me back in time and i could start to forget that i had just had a very grown-up experience.  this is veg comfort food to my nth degree.  crispy, fatty, salt-kissed chips with some nice gooey 'cheese' and an amazing cilantro sour cream substitute all piled super high....it makes me feel like i'm being extra good to myself.         \"go ahead, you're worth it,\"  they whisper to me.   as i try to eat them somewhat strategically - the right ratio of bean, tomato, cheese, lettuce, olive, corn, sour cream to chip - they are messy, crunchy and yuuuummmmmyyyyyy.  i can think of nothing else and THAT was exactly what i needed."}
{"text":"Updating to say that brunch at Tex Tubbs is truly a revelation. I want to eat the blue corn pancakes with spicy maple syrup every day of my life. The brisket breakfast burrito is to die for as well. Definitely give them a try for your next weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"The food is easily 4 or 5 stars. I'm giving it 3 for everything else that was just abysmal. I've gotten the taco plater a few times and all the tacos I've tried are great. The boyfriend got the frito burrito and loved it.   The room we ate in was the large one in the back. It was obnoxiously loud due to a large group there. We all left with pounding headaches. Several babies cried from the noise a few times -- no joke. The service was also painfully slow. I got water and somehow that took longer than multiple drinks from the bar. It took 10 minutes to get a refill and over 10 just to get the waitress to take the check. Restaurants shouldn't make it hard for you to pay.   The food is so good I'll be back or at least get takeout from there, but this particular experience left a sour taste in my mouth. Free chips when you check in on yelp though!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this restaurant twice. He has been unlucky on both visits. I personally found the tacos blehhh. The tortillas were so bland and dry. The ingredients seemed as if they were just sitting out before we received the platters. My boyfriend's Frito Burrito was just a bad combo. Sometimes simple is better. The burrito had an unappetizing mix of ingredients. They didn't go well together. Fried avocados don't make burritos better. They ruin them. We couldn't get the tastes off our tongues fast enough."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming my go to spot in Madison.  Third time dine in and 2 times takeout.  Always great service and food and kids eat free on Monday night.  All of the vegetarian tacos and burritos are creative and delicious.  Still working my way through the menu."}
{"text":"This is definitely a tex-mex restaurant, but if that's what you're looking for, look no further. We came here for brunch on a weekend and were pleasantly surprised. This was kind of a hole-in-the-wall out of the way place I would say. We were immediately seated and offered chips. They were warm and tasty and you can go and pick out your favorite salsas out of a station of four different types (my favorite was the green one actually!).  I was also pleasantly surprised to find out that taco platters tacos can be interchanged: you can pick any different combination of tacos you want! The tacos themselves were delicious: I tried the bacon, egg & avocado taco, smoked brisket & egg taco, tequila lime shrimp taco, and el pastor & pineapple taco. My favorite breakfast one was the smoked brisket and both the regular menu ones were excellent. The meats were very well done and the breakfast tacos were surprisingly good. The refried beans were also delicious, while the rice was okay. The potatoes that came with the breakfast tacos were also very delicious and charred well. Though not expensive, it was about $10 an entree for the two taco platters and $13 for a 3 taco platter, which is pricier with less food provided than a real Mexican taqueria.   Overall, I will definitely come back, as I heard the frozen drinks here were also tasty. A decent brunch place."}
{"text":"My husband loved his tacos here, but I wasn't crazy about my own. I love their idea of the \"salsa bar\" but we didn't really think the salsas were very good. Used the Yelp check in for the free chips and salsa, which was nice. Service was fine. Overall probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Tex Tubbs based on the reviews I read and the menu I reviewed prior to my visit, but unfortunately it didn't deliver more than your average taco joint. There were a few moments where I questioned other reviews: 1. Upon ordering the Mexican corn which read that it would come in 4 small cobbs, the server placed a bowl on our table with 4 spoons (we were a group of 4 men). I took it upon myself to find 3 additional bowls to split it up. 2. Our taco dinners were supposed to included our choice of two sides, but we were never prompted to choose and when the plates came out they only included the tacos. 3. And the most amazing thing of all - they charge 4.99 for chips and salsa! 4.99! The food was OK, I recommend the fish tacos, but the whole experience left me not interested to return."}
{"text":"Maaaannnn. This is my favorite Tex-Mex spot in Madison. What got me hooked on the place was their margaritas. They are damn good (Ultimate/Palace). But, the best thing about this place, in my opinion, is the TAMALES!! Every single time I look at the menu like \"Maybe I should get something different...\" and (almost) every single time I don't. The tamales are the bomb. They also make a mean taco salad, as well as some delicious and unique tacos. I seriously haven't tried anything here that was not good. This includes their salsa bar (which you can enjoy for free if you're a Yelper and you check in) which has four delicious types of salsa. Anyway, I should probably get a job here so I can get a damn discount with how much we go."}
{"text":"Finally went here after hearing my friends rave about this place for months. I had a really good burrito, it had feta cheese and fried avocados but it was tasty and more unique than any regular burrito I've had. Go here, and if anything at least get the queso. I almost cried when I tried it, I cannot recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Excellent choices, flavors of exotic origination, beef, pork, chicken,  fish, veggies and a mixture.  The three combo player was good but filling, go with two unless very hungry. Good service, food and little slow. Chips are no complimentary,  but yelp has coupon to use. Cell Service inside poor so chech in before you go in for free chips. Salsa bring great."}
{"text":"I would definitely go back to this place!!!  They had a great assortment of salsa, great drinks and my burrito was fantastic.   I had the fried avocado burrito and it was very tastey!!!  Cute little place!!!"}
{"text":"This place has definitely gotten better.  New taco options with lots of variety."}
{"text":"Meh + shrug, is the best expression for how I feel about Tex Tubb's, but overall, they are okay.  I would say their food is a little hit or miss. For example, their fish tacos are great, but their vegetarian tacos are... how do you say... not a joy to eat, conversely, their burritos are pretty good.  To a certain extent, this place embodies what a Midwesterner thinks Mexican food is, but that's also it's best feature. It's unhindered by tradition and is willing to explore what it means to be a taco.  What I've tried: Veggie Tamale- meh, I would not recommend this one. It's not very interesting and there was way too much masa and not enough filling. Could have been an isolated problem to my particular tamale. Atwood Burrito- I liked this one. Flavorful and interesting Blackened Baja Cod taco- This goes for the blackened and the beer battered, nice flaky fish and I really liked the slaw topping. Beer Battered Baja Cod taco Avocado Frito Taco- surprisingly flavorless. I never thought I would find this one boring but I did. Flavors were very monochromatic and it rubbed me wrong that there were 2 pieces of fried avocado and yet still managed to be overfilled, mainly with black beans. I ate part of this one with a fork and then gave up because I was so bored. Fried Cauliflower Taco- cauliflower was undercooked and waaay under seasoned. Also, smaller piece sizes would do wonders. The corn tortillas in general here are not to my liking. They are floppy and a little too squishy. They should have some texture to them.  If someone asked me to point them in the direction of unconventional tacos, I'd send them here. But, if they asked for the really good stuff, I'd send them to Taqueria Guadalajara or El Jalapeno."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty decent! It is definitely american style tacos so just be sure that is what you're looking for. They've got a free nacho bar with 3 different kinds of salsa which I think was a very good touch. I really appreciated that part of it! All of the specialty tacos that they had were good. They were meaty and full of flavor. I would definitely recommending giving this place a try if you're looking for some decent tex-mex at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! The food is different and seriously delicious. You should definitely get the taco platter and choose three flavors just for fun. It will be far too much food, but do it anyway. The variety here is killer and it would be silly to do anything but gorge yourself.  The prickley pear margarita was sweet and a perfect start to our meal. We enjoyed guacamole, white queso and the salsa bar while waiting for our meals and I can tell that I would love a happy hour here. They had mild verde (read boring) but yum! did that chile de arbol have some zing. Tread lightly here, I seriously love heat. My taco trio consisted of avocado frito, southern comfort and el pastor. The avocado frito is a lightly breaded and fried avocado with beans and cheese and mushrooms. I'd give this one three stars, good but the other two were to die for. The southern comfort had fried chicken which was crisp and salty, with soft sweet potato hash and chipotle sour cream drizzled on top. Slam dunk, Tubbs.  Then my absolute favorite, el pastor. Tender pork, tangy pineapple and cheese, all wrapped up for sweet and salty, juicy and savory pleasure. This one is not to miss!  If you are looking for awesome flavor, you simply must stop in to Tubbs for a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!  Highly recommend the giant burrito done in a chimi style with queso. (This will give you enough burrito goodness for three meals). My husband is a huge fan of the taco platters. You can mix different tacos from their expansive list of taco options. They also have great beer options and of course tasty margaritas. This restaurant has a lot of local charm and it is quite busy on Saturday nights, so try to go before 6 or plan on having an adult beverage while waiting for a table."}
{"text":"TT's was one of my favorite restaurants in town for a long time, but in the last year or so quality has been slipping in both food and service.   In my past review I sang the praises of the Southern Comfort taco, but I stopped ordering it because the sweet potatoes were routinely undercooked. I've since moved on to the Backyard BBQ, which is great when it's on, but I'd say about half the time I'm pulling a chunk of fat out of at least one of my tacos. The queso, while always tasty, is inconsistent - sometimes it's thick and sometimes it's runny.   Service is probably the biggest issue as of late. There's one server who is outstanding (shoutout to Matt, he might be the best server in Madison), but it's been awhile since we've seen him. Others of late have forgotten basics like bringing water (even after being asked), seating us then forgetting about us for twenty minutes, and bringing us a check before dessert when ordering the date night special (and not asking if we wanted it, though gratefully shaving $5 off the bill for not giving us our sopapilla sundae).  Tex Tubb's has become a staple in my boyfriend's and my rotation so we still go often, but I hope things start to swing back up into five-star territory instead of continuing to decline."}
{"text":"Indisputably the finest breakfast tacos ever offered to modern man. I shall never see their equal."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! So many vegan and gluten free options! The  vegan nachos were life changing!"}
{"text":"Beware especially if the restaurant is busy. We stayed only because we were told the wait would be twenty minutes, which we considered acceptable. The wait was thirty minutes. After we were seated, having invested a half hour of our time, the waitress tells us that the kitchen is \"a little behind.\" I know she's not telling us that it's five minutes behind. I ordered a margarita that, frankly, was not very potent or tasty. After forty minutes, our food finally came. Edible, but nothing special. What should have been a 30-40 minute-dinner took 1 hour and forty minutes. Don't waste your time & money here; you can get much better Tex-Mex food at Eldorado Grill, about a mile or so away."}
{"text":"I have exclusively heard negative things about the Food-Fight, inc chain of restaurants.  So, I had to try one of them for myself.    The tacos were good and the lunch special is quite reasonable.  You can get out of there for less than $10, if you play your cards right.  Negative:  chips and salsa aren't free..."}
{"text":"UPDATE: After posting my original review (below), the management sent me a voucher for a free meal. That experience was much better! Good on them for following up with dissatisfied customers!  Original Review: Visited for Saturday brunch. We ordered chips and salsa. The salsa bar was great - unlimited salsa in three/four varieties. I had the breakfast brisket burrito. The brisket was extremely fatty, but the rest of the burrito was delicious. Service was a little slow, especially since the place wasn't very busy. Overall, not a bad experience, but not great."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere with delicious food and drinks. Mind blowingly fast service and great happy hour deals. Filling portions, will definitely be returning back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for the family. Great food and service. I highly recommend this place. Variety of salsas, great churros and the queso dip is very good.! The staff is friendly and the general manager Tony makes sure that your experience is the best. My favorite dish is the Green Chile Chicken Tacos."}
{"text":"I seriously loved everything about the food at this place. The chips were awesome. The queso was outstanding - not the cheap yellow nacho kind of queso. The good blanco kind. I got a two-taco platter. Each taco was super full of good stuff (no skimping) and flavorful sauces. They have an awesome selection of different types of tacos. I ordered my tacos with a side of sweet potato fries, which were some of the best ones I've ever eaten. If this place had more seating and the wait wasn't so long on weekends, I would probably eat there way more often!!  Love you, Tex Tubbs!!"}
{"text":"I just have a problem with a $4 vegetable taco.   I went in and got two veggie/bean tacos + a slaw side. It wasn't bad and it wasn't great. I did not enjoy the humungous fill of the tortilla. It was a lot of vege, cooked fine, and totally decent flavors, but it just felt fundamentally wrong.   Why is a taco worth $4? It doesn't seem like it is the quality of the carrot, or like cabbage has all of a sudden quintupled in price. It seems like it is the zip code, the decor, and the use of cream instead of lime.   The brilliance of a taco is in it's simplicity. A massive overflowing mess of ten things that are not lime, chili, onion, etc is just a dumb salad."}
{"text":"I have no clue why I have lived in Madison for 20 years and have still never gone here! A friend and I did lunch there today and had a good time. The server was incredibly attentive and genuinely nice. We got a seat by the window and ordered pretty quickly, since I suppose we both know what we like as far as Mexican food goes. I got the giant burrito with a side of guacamole. And a bloody mary. I'm fairly picky about my bloody Mary's and this one was good! It had tons of garnish and was just spicy enough and didn't have too much horseradish. The burrito that I ordered was also delicious. I got it with shredded beef and the beef was a little bit on the dry side, but overall it was very tasty. Sometimes I shy away from saying anything good or bad about food fight restaurants, because they are food fight restaurants. There's something a little bit corporate about them. But our server and his demeanor reassured me that it is a local business and they do take pride in being local. I will most likely be back again!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best jalapeño poppers in the country!  Awesome, fun place.  Great staff and great drinks.  Go there and try it - don't need to say more!! A new weekly stop for my family!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while, but now I'm not sure why.   Tex Tubbs was loud and hectic. The ridiculous \"salsa bar\" made it more hectic. There is no reason whatsoever to set up a special area for four salsas. You could just put them in squeeze bottles on the table. To add insult to injury, none of the salsas was particularly good, and the \"hot\" one was not hot at all. El Dorado serves one salsa, and it is far, far better than any of the four at Tex Tubb's.  The dining room was not only extremely loud, but also pretty filthy. Trash remained on the floor for over ten minutes. It was gross.  Or at least I thought it was gross until I got my food. I had a three taco platter: - puerco meatballs: This one answered the question of why you don't make a taco with tiny little round meatballs (hint: they roll out) - chorizo black bean: dry and extremely salty - traditional carnitas: this one was almost passable.  My wife had a taco salad that came with what appeared to be an entire tub of sour cream dumped on top.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Dude. Chips. And salsa. I know I'm late to the party, but if it were socially acceptable and those tubs were a lot bigger I would go swimming in the stuff. So good."}
{"text":"PROS: Lots of variety, tasty tacos, nice salsa bar, decent portions CONS: sweet potato taco was not very good  I love how there are plenty of vegetarian options and they are actually really tasty too. It's rare for a a taco joint to cater toward vegetarians, so kudos to that.  I especially liked the Baja fish taco and the brussel sprouts taco. Both were really solid, and I would definitely return to try more items from the menu. I would pass on the sweet potato tacos the next time though. The chips were really crisp, and everything tasted really fresh. We came during lunch, and it seemed quite lively even on a weekday.  They also have a huge variety of alcoholic drinks and Mexican sodas. I definitely loved the grungy vibe."}
{"text":"Been awhile since I've eaten at TTTP the atmosphere hasn't, which is good. Menu has expanded, in a good way, more great tacos. Go to place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I think Tex Tubbs does veggie tacos better than the meat tacos. I had the 2 taco plate today with the Hot Mama (Fried chicken soaked in house made buffalo sauce, with fresh lettuce, julienned celery, pico de gallo, and sour cream in a handmade corn tortilla) and the Grilled Portabella Mushroom taco (Fresh spinach, roma tomatoes, crumbled goat cheese, toasted pumpkin seeds, and roasted poblano  sour cream in a handmade corn tortilla.) The Hot Mama was very disappointing. If you love buffalo chicken you should not get this taco. I didn't get any of that hot buffalo flavor at all, mostly celery. And the fried chicken was just so sad. KFC has better fried chicken. This chicken had no flavor at all. I also got a side of the jicama slaw which had very little jicama in it, a couple of slices of mango, but lots of mayo and cabbage. Bland city. Put some caraway seeds in there or something.   The one thing they did do right was the Portabella taco. The mushroom was marinated and sliced into strips and the goat cheese was tangy and perfect.   Service was really slow. I walked in by myself around noon today and waited around for five minutes to be seated because no one was watching the front. Also, my server dropped my check off while I was in the middle of eating. Kind of presumptuous and rude.   In summary, stick with the veggie tacos and stay away from their jicama slaw."}
{"text":"The fish tacos here are amazing!! The drinks are reasonable too and the front window tables are excellent for people watching. The portions are smaller, which is why most people complain, but if you fine with watching what you eat its fine. The food is spiced nicely and I've only had good experiences eating here."}
{"text":"I'm basing my three star review on the service and the variety of non-meat options on the menu.  The food itself only earns two stars, in my opinion.  We tried the chips and salsa as well as a variety of tacos and sides.  Apparently, the only way they know how to add flavor is to add more salt.  The chips, salsa and sweet potato fries were way, way too salty, but the tacos lacked any flavor.  The various taco fillings were dry and bland.  Compared to other Madison tex-mex restaurants (El Dorado or Pasqual's) T Tubb's is definitely last on my list.  Their menu has a lot of variety, but maybe they need to slim it down and perfect some of the basics.  Their service was outstanding though!  Our waiter was pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Tex Tubb's is so good that even though it's 2 hours away from me, I've been there numerous times since first discovering it! The staff is so great and the atmosphere is relaxed. Every time we go I tell myself that I'll try something new on the menu and always end up getting tacos. There are too many choices! And they are all amazing! The Pastor and Pineapple is my absolute favorite. SO flavorful! My sister swears by the Fried Cauliflower. She craves it all the time. We've also gone for brunch and it's awesome. The only miss for me is the Chorizo. I LOVE Chorizo and I LOVE spicy food but this Chorizo is so spicy and smacks you in your face with heat that you can't appreciate any other flavors. I got almost half way through it and had to quit. Chorizo should have a kick but it should also have other great notes like garlic and nutmeg, etc. This Chorizo is just REALLY spicy. So if you like a challenge, get Chorizo!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst tasting salad I've ever had. The blackened chicken Cobb was just bad. The spices were awful and overwhelming. It had way too much tarragon. The chicken was so bad (overcooked and terrible taste) that the rest of the salad tasted awful; it infected the rest of it. The egg had ugly grey rings and tasted old.  The torta was OK."}
{"text":"Great little taco joint in the Atwood neighborhood! We went for lunch the other day and each got a taco platter. I love that there are many types of tacos to choose from with unique flavor profiles. I got the blackened fish (good, but not remarkable) and the house-made pork (AMAZING). We also shared some queso. I had the jicama slaw on the side which was a little too creamy and bland. That aside, the overall meal and service was very good, so I'd be happy to go back."}
{"text":"We love the food here, but contacting them about whether they take reservations is a hassle. We were hoping to do a birthday there, so I contacted the assistant manager via the email suggested on the website and never got a reply. Since I got no reply, I called in and found out that they don't take reservations at all. They should really put this info on the website so people don't waste their time; also, the contact email should at least respond with the requested information rather than just ignoring it."}
{"text":"I was skeptical but this place exceeded my expectations. They charge for chips and salsa (something about that bugs me) and that is my only complaint.   Found a parking spot right out front, right away. We had a large party so we called ahead. Our table was ready when we got there. The staff was really friendly and attentive. I felt like they took really good care of us without hovering the party. Drinks came out fast (Good beer selection actually). $3 Two Hearted Drafts! The margaritas were outstanding, in my opinion. They have a salsa bar which is a huge plus. Chips were fresh, so was the guac. My tacos (El Pastor, Carne with a Verde Sauce, and Chipotle Beef) were not very authentic but I was expecting that since its Tex - Mex (this isn't a complaint). Anything they lacked in authenticity was a twist to make the food more interesting. Prices were not bad at all. Try the pickled vegetables; they are shockingly good. (I can't believe I wrote that).   Overall a good spot to try for something different."}
{"text":"First of all, I know that this isn't an authentic taqueria.  It isn't even an authentic Tex-Mex restaurant.  But we decided to give it a try anyway, just to see what it's all about.  I'd have to say that while there were some disappointments with our meal there were a few delicious surprises.  Once we looked at the menu we were floored to find out that they charged for chips and also.  It was alright, but we've had much better, and more importantly FREE, chips and salsa.  My husband's flour tortilla taco with el pastor left much to be desired.  Same goes to my corn tortilla taco with carne asada.  The meat in there barely resembled meat--it looked like the presliced stuff you get in the frozen food aisle.  I also wish that I didn't order rice and refried beans.  They were the NASTIEST rice and beans I've ever had.  The rice tasted stale with dry peas and tomato... it also tasted more like biryani, which I like when I'm expecting on eating biryani, not Mexican rice.  And I've had better refried beans out of the can.  And the service was spotty.  Our server was nice, but it was slow and it took her three visits to our table to finally ask us if we were ready to order our entrees.  So why the 3 stars?  My son's chicken fingers and tots were tasty, and he was given a god amount of food for what we paid.  My husband was very happy with his frito burrito--filled with fried chicken, beef, rice, and the namesake: fritos.  I know, sounds crazy but it worked apparently.  And we were both crazy about my fried chicken BLT and avocado taco.  The chicken had so much flavor and was moist.  The bacon, lettuce, tomato, and avocado tasted and looked real fresh.  Then there was ranch that tied it all together.  Next time I'm ordering two and nothing else... maybe I'll try dessert.  The desserts sounded good, but we opted not to order anything.  Next time I might get a choco taco or a Fat Elvis cupcake because those sounded good."}
{"text":"For those of us who are gluten-free, two of the simplest cuisines to opt for eating out are Sushi or Mexican/Tex-Mex.  Tex Tubbs serves the latter very well, and I think they currently win for my favorite taco place in Madison.  Service is pretty good, even when they get crazy-busy on the weekends, and if you're a margarita fan, you definitely need to give theirs a try."}
{"text":"Food Fight seems to have a predictable ambiance - they are just too cool for school. I have yet to feel welcomed in their establishments, which frankly, is unfortunate because all of their restaurants come so highly recommended by all of my Madison friends.  I ended up calling in an order to go - mostly because the consensus is the food is great but the service and environment  is lackluster.   It's hard to judge on take out food, but I ordered was good. Fish tacos, beef tacos and tamales.  Warning, the tamales are huge. Even though they are on the appetizer list. Huge. I ordered 4 to split between 2 people, thinking they were going to be, you know, small tamales. Guess what I'm eating for breakfast?   My food was ready when they said it was going to be. It was packaged nicely. Trying to get into the entryway was a bit annoying, as there were 10-15 people waiting for tables.   I really wish I could give this place 3.5 stars, because it wasn't terrible. The food was good, but I don't think I would eat here. I didn't feel welcomed, I felt in the way and I didn't feel cool enough to walk in there. I dropped 50 bucks (10 tip on a to go order) so I'm not a rookie when it comes to ordering out or the service industry. I felt the same way at El Dorado. Food Fight, you may have a monopoly on hip eateries here in Madison, but I implore you to visit other cities. I never feel this way in the nicest of restaurants  (you know the ones with courses and a dress code) in Chicago."}
{"text":"Tex Tubbs offers a fun atmosphere and a creative menu. If you're looking for authentic, look again. The key to satisfaction here is ordering the funkier items that put a spin on more classic TexMex dishes.  For example, the southern inspired fried chicken tacos are awesome. The flavors go so well together. The unique burrito bowls are also super tasty. However, I wasn't as thrilled with my steak taco. Wasn't bad, but didn't blow my mind.   While the wait was long, the service ended up being fantastic! Our awesome waitress did an amazing job with our large group. Highly recommend celebrating a birthday here. You can grab drinks at One Barrel while you wait for a table."}
{"text":"Let me admit one thing....my review is purely based on the fish taco..and a couple other things! My wife and I cant get enough of the fish tacos....2 of my favs: fried tilapia...ummmmmmm....smoked salmon...yummy.  I had their chkn quesadilla once and it was really good too.  Also I like their guacamole...it comes on a tostada when ordered as a side...which is awesome with the guac."}
{"text":"Never had a bad time.  They have a cool salsa bar.  Sucks you have to pay for your chips/salsa, but I'm always willing.  Their food is great, atmosphere better.  Reasonably priced.  Frito burrito is out of this world."}
{"text":"I deviated from my usual choices at my most recent visit around noon on a Saturday, since I was wowed by the breakfast offerings on the menu, all of which sound freaking amazing. I've never stopped in so early before, so I was unaware. I recommend checking them out asap!  I had the blue corn pancakes served with chipotle butter and ghost pepper maple syrup, and I can't even tell you how g- d- great it was. I think I was levitating off my chair for time, it was so good. I don't even know how to describe the magical way those ingredients interacted.  For a side, I had the $2.99 slab of ham, and I do mean a slab. It's as big and thick as a steak, and super flavorful and tender. My g-d. What a deal, what a breakfast, and to even have a great margarita with it just seems like a crazy amount of happy for a gray Saturday.  I was bummed by the rude hostess when we arrived, and I did let the staff know, and they more than made up for it with the rest of the service during our visit, not to (again) mention off-the-charts-good food. So, yeah. Go visit Mr. Tubbs at your earliest convenience."}
{"text":"Texas Tubb's is a great Mexican Restaurant right on Atwood Ave. I was in Madison for 4 months last year for a mission trip and this place was one that we would go to. I would get the tacos and that is also something that I would recommend. They are really really good!!   *They have a check in to get a free basket of chips and salsa"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in Madison so far.  Got the three taco platter and could only finish 2.  The sauces were incredible and the sweet potato fries on the side were super crisp and tasty.  Try the hot sauce on the table (\"Mandy's\" I think), it's smoky and not too spicy, went really well with the pulled pork."}
{"text":"So many tacos to choose from. The portion of the tacos are huge.great beer selection amazing staff and great spot"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and haven't been impressed. I've had WAY BETTER tacos around town. This place has been a major disappointment more than once. I guess it's all about the location for this one. Hipster?? Not sure what the customers come for..."}
{"text":"We were in Madison for just a couple days and found this place.  We loved it! Great food, good drinks and atmosphere.  We both had tacos, go figure lol We knew before we left that we'd be back.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Chips and guac make this place worth coming to. The margarita frozen flights are exceptional. I got the Sangria, which was not as sweet as I'd hoped it would be. Salsa bar was ok, nothing extraordinary. This place has terrible seating and wait times. The waitress we had was so busy, we only saw her three times and had to go ask for our to-go boxes. We ordered the 3-taco platter. The pineapple-coconut chicken needed something spicy to counteract all the sweetness and it didn't have enough sauce. The BBQ pork was the best. I tried the tilapia taco & there was not enough flavor. My fiancée tries the sweet potato fries and said they were fantastic.  I would come back here again, but not on such a busy night."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times before and have always had a good experience. Tonight was a different story; I was there for my birthday dinner with my siblings, which made the experience an even bigger bummer. We ordered three entrees; the first two came out quickly, but the third was delayed by about 10 minutes. When we said something to the server (Finley), he blamed the expo/runner. We didn't see him again until we were done eating. At that point we ordered churros and another entree to go. The churros took 20 minutes to come out; the to go entree even made it to us before them. When we said something to the server, he blamed being on a wait and made a snide comment about showing us the ticket so we can see what time he entered it; based on what was happening at the tables around us, that seemed like an excuse. There was an issue with the card we tried to use to pay the bill and he was incredibly smug about telling us it was declined. We ended up paying with cash and requested out change. It  was only 67 cents and he must have assumed that that meant he wasn't getting a tip, because he brought back a roll of pennies plus a handful more to round out the amount. It was just me of the most ridiculous service experiences I've ever had. I was a server for 10 years; I understand that things happen -- food gets held up, etc -- but the server's attitude was unbelievable."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch was a good choice here! I recommend anything on that food menu.   I had the Migas, my boyfriend had the pancakes, and we split chips. The salsa bar is always a good appetizer! I loved the Migas, which was also a huge platter to split or take home. The pancakes were small but deceivingly filling. Overall, I loved the food, and it was a great cost.   Customer Service was amazing and friendly, as always with Food Fight Inc restaurants!  The only thing I don't recommend is the Bloody Mary, for $8 it wasn't anything special and it wasn't topped with more than olives and a pickle. I've had better for cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tex-Mex.  Quirky character.  Yup.  Oh, and great margaritas!    Right off the bat, if you are expecting authentic mexican food, this is not it.  But it is great food.  TexMex has more cheddar, veggies, black beans and cumin.  And do not get me wrong, I love me some texmex but it can let you down if you are really craving authentic burritos.  When I am in the mood for tex-mex, Tex Tubb's fits the bill.  Margaritas and personality up the wazoo.  We went on a Saturday night and was seated immediately, as opposed to the 30-minute wait across the street at Alchemy (though that place will be saved for another night).    I had a sangria.  I have not had many but this one tasted swell.  The sig. other had a mule or something.  I guess their tradition is that if you finish off the bottle of tequilla, the customer gets to eat the scorpion that was lingering in it...and yes, yes, he did.  I guess that just adds to the personality of the establishment.  This time we ordered nachos and they are HUGE.  They for sure made it clear that this could feed 4 people so they were smart on that front but we finished it all within 10 minutes because it was that good.  We have also had a variety of their burritos, all of which are great as well.  Oh, and they have a salsa bar!  No scorpions in those, luckily."}
{"text":"My tacos were good, the wait for the tacos was not.   Additionally, I do not dig the order and then seat yourself as it begets jerkys who hoard seats and people who get their food and can't sit down to eat it."}
{"text":"i may know how magnets work but... tex tubb's queso?  SHIT IS MAGICAL."}
{"text":"The food is ok.  Not amazing, not terrible.  Had the burrito once, I liked it, and the tacos once.  The tacos were too watery.  Salsa and chips is all right,not amazing. Guacamole, good.  But.  We ordered 2 pitchers of the on-the-rocks margaritas, for our group of 4 people.  The pitchers were the pitchers mostly ice.  They were $26 each.  So in the end, for a modest meal and a little more than one actual glass of drink for each person resulted in the most expensive meal we have had in Madison besides, say, the Tornado room.  I'm sorry but that is ridiculous for a meal that's as cheap as Mexican food to make.  I honestly cannot recommend this place based on mediocre food and the cost combined.  I will not plan on coming back here again, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Yes, I've lived around Madison for 16 years and this is the first time I dined at Tex Tubbs (waits for the gasps to subside). That's because every other time I tried to go, it was AT LEAST a 40 minute wait for a table, which was no bueno. Especially when almost every Mexican restaurant in town probably had immediate seating.   So finally, we hit on an off hour and got seated right away. Service was fine.  Decent beer selection (limited taps, but more bottles). Now, on to the food.   Tacos were generously heaped with fillings. Ranked favorite to least:  Southern Fried Chicken....I want to go back for this taco. The sweet potato hash ads a great texture element.  Chorizo & Black Bean: Chorizo lovers will adore the generous heap of pretty darn spicy chorizo over the beans. I'd get it again in a heartbeat.  Carnitas: Juicy and flavorful, but nothing particularly exciting. Carne Asada: Thin ribbons of meat, decent. El pastor: Okay, I'm an el pastor snob, so take this for what it's worth. The pineapple was great, but I have my Madison el pastor favorites. I'd skip this next time and go to a Mexican restaurant to get my el pastor fix. If you aren't a card-carrying el pastor fan, you might love Tex's version.   The rice and beans were good. Medium sauces from the sauce bar were great and a must for spicing up many of the tacos.   I'll hit up Tex Tubbs again (when there's no wait) and stick to some of their quirkier items, where they shine. It would be a great place for a group to dine, because there's something for everyone and super casual. Which is probably why it's a gazillion minute wait all the time."}
{"text":"I avoided going here for the eight years I've lived here because I was worried it would be bad compared to the food I could get in my last home in the Southwest. Actually, I should have avoided it it just because it's terrible. I got three tacos: portobello, fried cauliflower, and a veggie tostada. The descriptions made them sound so good - not traditional, but delicious sounding. The tortillas were bland and nearly raw tasting, and the fillings were surprising bland as well. The cauliflower itself was ok, but I was honestly really surprised at how little flavor everything had. I even topped my tacos with an extra side of pickled vegetables, but that didn't help much. Don't waste your money on this - it's much cheaper and sooo much tastier at Guadalajara. I should have known better."}
{"text":"The steak was overcooked, the fried chicken was dry, the BBQ pork flavorless.   The manager followed up with me and was very kind. I'll be revisiting."}
{"text":"THIS IS LOVE.  I am not being dramatic. I have never been so emotional about tacos. Even looking at the menu and taco combinations, I was salivating and anxious for my table so I could be introduced to the most beautiful tacos I have ever had the pleasure of eating.   Okay, maybe I'm being dramatic. But Tex Tubb's deserves this. I ordered the 2 taco platter for $9.99 which came with two tacos of my choice, and a side of rice and black beans. First of all, these are the thickest and biggest tacos you can find in Madison. The white corn tortillas are strong enough to support them, but Tex Tubb's does not skimp on the filling or sauces inside. My eyes and face lit up when I received my platter and in no time, my friend and I needed to start digging in. I ordered the El Pastor & Pineapple taco, as well as the Chipotle Beef (but substituted the sour cream for chipotle sour cream). She ordered the Fried Cauliflower taco and the Backyard BBQ. Individual reviews below:  El Pastor & Pineapple: So delicious!!!! I don't know if it's because I'm obsessed with pineapple, but the marinated pineapple with the meat was mind-blowing. I wish there was more pineapple in it but zayum, this is a winner for sure.  Chipotle Beef: Decent, but nothing too special for me. I wish I hadn't substituted out the regular sour cream - adding the chipotle sour cream with the already marinated beef was a little too spicy for me but that was my bad.  Fried Cauliflower: Interesting and awesome!! What a cool texture in a taco. Flavor was delicious and it was just such a wild experience to eat this.  Backyard BBQ: PLEASE YES. I was hesitant to try because I feel like American BBQ doesn't need to be brought into the taco realm. Okay, I was wrong. Along with the avocado and cheese, this was a freaking dream. Please never change.  I wish I had a bigger stomach to keep eating more tacos; this is my only regret. The rice and beans were also a great palate cleanser in between the flavorful tacos and better than most other Mexican restaurants I've tried. Wish I had the stomach space to order the chips and salsa from the bar (also because if you check in on Yelp, you get this for free !!!!!!) or margaritas because everything looked incredible.  Fast and friendly service from the waiter as well, and we were seated in a nice area with light from the open ceiling. Thank you Tex Tubb's, for an amazing experience. Is it possible to cry taco tears or joy? Unclear. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This might be the alcohol talking, but I think I'm in love.  \"Tex Tubb's has gawt it going on.\" Said by a true-bred Texan (me). The moment that I walked it, I felt swept out of the cold and right back to my hipster-Texas home town and college days. This Shiner Bock banner hanging from the ceiling had my mouth watering for that cheap liquid gold.  Let's talk about the food, though. Unlimited. Chips. and Salsa. That's the mark of a good eatery. Of course, I don't mean just bland, flavorless salsa like you might find in any northern restaurant. No, their salsa bar has many options of flavor packed, relatively spicy salsa. I appreciate it, I like it, I'll go back for more (it is unlimited, anyways). As for entrees, I went in for tacos and tacos is what I got. I tried the Tequila Lime Shrimp, Cauliflower, Grilled Portabella Mushroom, El Pastor and Pineapple. and Steak and Salsa verde. Wowy wow, not one disappointed.  I am excited to go back and try more of their menu options.   Oh wait! I almost forgot to mention the Margaritas. Get yourself a flight of Margaritas (if you are of age, of course). Try out some new flavors! The Mango was delish, Strawberry was mediocre, and the Prickly pear tasted like a slushie, but I thoroughly enjoyed each one."}
{"text":"Ok we can in from Michigan and I wanted tacos and a beer. My wife who is Irish and loves her beer and tacos was floored with the ambience of the place. The food was great fresh tasting and was served on glassware with the proper silverware. The service was on point are server Logan was knowledgeable and had no profit my wife's ala-cart wishes. I had the Cuban taco platter and a couple of Dos Equis"}
{"text":"The name is fitting for this place!  It is definitely Tex mex food.  Some Mexican flavor but tamed down.  I tried this place out with some friends so we had a variety of things to try.  The tamales were a good portion but didn't have a lot of meat inside and the sauce was almost non existent.  We ordered a few different tacos to try.  There is a big selection of flavors to try which was great!  I wish the flavor and quality was as good as the selection.  One of the tacos had more pork fat then actual pork.  There was no flavor to the meat.  The quesadilla was decent out of everything we all ordered.   The atmosphere inside was okay and pretty chill.  The table was super wobbly and we tested the one next to us, same thing.  The server was nice and seemed pretty knowledgeable with the menu.  Parking is tricky.  There was a little side lot and that was it."}
{"text":"Tortilla soup looked great but had very weak broth--salsas were average at best,achiote fried tilipia was good, nice flavor, if the tacos lived up to the descriptions it would have been a great meal but it once again flavors were lacking---great concept but poor execution  drinks were well done and beer was good"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see a line when I was checking in and  guessed the food would be good. In fact, I had a taco platter and it was really good.  * the only thing I will add is that the chips they offer to right while waiting for your order isn't free of charge. The server asked me if I want chips with salsa or guacamole. I said guacamole and it appeared on my bill. Would have been nice to let me know in advance.  Otherwise I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came upon this place after I attempted to have food and drinks at another restaurant. Since my party and I received no service, we got the point that our business was not wanted and saw the Taco Palace. I have to say the other restaurant did me a favor as if it weren't for their horrible service, I wouldn't have checked this place out.  Well, right away we were greeted by super friendly staff. We sat in the front area and within minutes, we had drinks and ordered appetizers. The utilized the Yelp \"check in offer\" of free chips and salsa which was AWESOME. They have a great salsa bar that offers mild, medium, and hot salsas. We also ordered the Tubbs Nachos which were HUGE and had a lot of fresh and beautiful ingredients.   For my main dish, I had the tilapia tacos which were out of this world and the sweet potato fries. My mom had tacos as well and a bloody mary which was one of the best that I have ever had.   Our waitress was fast and attentive and sweet and I loved her purple hair.   The décor and the atmosphere was comfortable and inviting. The next time I am in this area, I will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I must be missing something with this place.  Being a Madison native, fan of Food Fight, and a lover of tacos, it sounds like a lock.  However, after two visits I have chosen not to return.  The first was full of mediocrity.  The service was great at least.  And having only had a couple of generic tacos it seemed logical to try again.    On the second trip I brought my friend's daughter.  We had a pile of tacos.  We had skipped breakfast for fishing and were incredibly hungry. Unfortunately, even after factoring that into making everything better than it is, none of them were really that good.  The brisket tasted the best by far, though it was so greasy that it made eating it a bit of chore and a bit disgusting.  I am obsessed with tacos. Knowing that there are so many other options in the Madison area, it's hard to see how they keep going.  I am certain you can find better tacos elsewhere."}
{"text":"A second visit to Tex Tubbs still left me feeling \"meh\" about the place. They claim to be an Austin taco spot, so I hold them to Austin taco standards. That being said, they fall short.   Their salsas are much better than most places in town. The guacamole is good. They serve Lonestar, Shiner, and Tito's Vodka, which is cool. The tacos, however, just lack the flavor profiles of a great Texas taco.   Good margarita specials on certain week nights."}
{"text":"Perks of Tex Tubb's: - great customer service!! My boyfriend and I felt very taken of while dining.  -dope margaritas and drink specials - great meal deals depending on the day - there is a salsa bar for your salsa needs  Downfalls of Tex Tubb's: - the food is not the best, but not the worst - parking is iffy and may be hard to find parking  - it can become loud if you're trying to have an intimate dinner"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Madison. I was a little disappointed when they recently changed the menu a bit and the food changed somewhat, but it's still good.  I lived in Austin briefly and it's so nice to have a place that is reminiscent of the Austin vibe. Plus, they have Lone Star beer. Score! (Those puzzles are the best.)  Favorite menu items: Sweet Potato Enchiladas (my almost always go-to) Black Bean and Corn Flautas Pork Tamales ALL the salsa  They also have margarita flights which are SO much fun and a great way to try a few different flavors.  9 times out of 10 our waiter/waitress is cool, fun, and attentive. The food is (almost) always amazing and the atmosphere is fantastic.  It can get pretty busy, but if you know the right times to go it's not so bad. And if you have to wait, it's totally worth it. They have a small bar area too so you can at least get a little liquored up while you wait to be fed.  Me, my friends, and my family come here for everything. Any time we have something remotely exciting happen that we could \"celebrate\"... we go to Tex Tubbs. Birthdays, promotions, oh hey you're randomly in town, etc. I bring all my out of town family and friends here as well. It's just one of those Madison places you HAVE to experience.  Eat here. Drink here. Laugh here. It's the best!"}
{"text":"I used to really like Tex Tubb's, but the place has gone down hill. I ordered a burrito and the rice and beans inside tasted like plastic. I think they were from the night before. I wouldn't recommend this place and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm in love with cauliflower right now. Tex Tubb's has a delicious vegetarian taco with the star ingredient being cauliflower. The side of beans and rice were tasty and the salsa bar brought everything up a notch on the flavor scale.   My boyfriend and I shared the ice cream dessert that has honey, chocolate, and a crispy cinnamon tortilla as a base. Oh yeah! That is a must! We had a lot of fun and great food. Definitely check this place out. :)"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and it's consistently enjoyable! Nice salsa bar, but it's not terribly surprising that none of the offerings are particularly spicy. They make a nice guacamole to go with the chips and salsa, so I'd recommend that as an appetizer.   I like the tacos quite a bit, and the variety on offer means pretty much anyone will be able to find something they'll like. The taco salads are also really good if you're looking for a marginally healthier option. I have not tried the burritos or rellanos, but the tamales are quite nice! I like the black beans more so than the refried, but the rice is probably the most disappointing item served.   I don't think the iced tea is fresh brewed, so I'd avoid that option. The beer selection is usually quite good, both in bottles and on draft. Tonight they had MobCraft Batshit Crazy on draft, and that's a HUGE win!   I'd certainly put this more in the Tex-Mex camp thank authentic. traditional Mexican, but it's solid for what it is. Worth a look, especially if you're already over on the East side."}
{"text":"My favorite taco place in Madison.  Love it.  Great tacos, great beer selection, and my kids love the meal selections they had.  My kids love to eat and they were impressed!  We love trying the different salsas at the salsa bar. Even better is we were raving about the meal and when the check came we found out that kids eat free.  Bonus!"}
{"text":"How has it taken me three years of living in Madison to finally try this place? There was a wait - about 15 minutes - as others have mentioned, but it's so worth it. I dig the atmosphere, our waitress was great, and the food came out quickly. I ordered two tacos: Carnitas and Backyard BBQ and they did not disappoint. I'll be back again soon for sure!"}
{"text":"My pal and I were looking for a nice dinner to catch up.  It was Dias de Muertos so we thought... Mexican.  This was a great choice.  All the staff was in make up and costumes.  Our server had a great face on!  As we look over the menu, our server was helpful and personable.  He was quick with my margarita and chips.  The salsa bar is a fun way to try new flavors a little at a time.  We both picked the Two Taco Platter.  I tried the Southern Comfort and Traditional Carnitas.  Both were excellent.  The beans and rice that came with the platter were some of the best I have ever had.  My friend had the Classic Carne Asada and one of the chicken ones.  She was in heaven.  We both look forward to trying this restaurant again."}
{"text":"On a tear looking for new places to chow in Mad City and came across this gem! Holy Mother of Fuc* was this place awesome! It's about as mexican as the Marlboro Man so don't expect something along the lines of what people call \"authentic mexican,\" but what you can expect is some of the most unique, delicious plates of their kind in this area.  The lady and I started out with some chips and salsa (Complimentary with a Yelp Check-In.) Basket of chips are brought out and you head up to the salsa bar where a variety awaits. Tried a little bit of each and all were excellent with the heat levels at a good medium.   For dinner, I took in the 3-Taco Platter with rice on the side, no beans as they give me gas! For my taco selection, I had the Green Chile Chicken, Traditional Carne Asada & Chorizo/Black Bean taco. I would suggest ordering two tacos as they are stuffed with goodness and quite filling. Was not a big fan of the Chorizo/Black Bean taco, but that was the lady having me order it ;-). The lady had the chicken enchiladas (3) and has two with red sauce and one with their signature queso. The enchiladas were AMAZING and had me wishing I ordered them myself. Only downside is they were a little jewish with the red sauce and queso on top, so order it with a little extra.  I will soon be back to this place and would recommend this to anyone. The atmosphere is very casual, service was great, and would be great for groups and even families to head out to. Throw back a margarita or a Lone Star Lager to wash it all down! Cheers!"}
{"text":"A perfect combination of Texas tacos with Madison local food and culture.  If you are vegetarian, try the carrot tacos (sounds odd but awesome).  I went with the more TX traditional brisket taco and was not disappointed.  We didn't drink but the margarita options look great.  The service was friendly and efficient and you can't ask for more than that.    We lived in Austin for several years and this place would stack up down there."}
{"text":"Some of the best Margaritas in Madison and vegan nachos!!!!! Great brunch menu and a gourmet salsa bar. Best Tex-Mex in town."}
{"text":"Negatives: Long wait. We were quoted 30 minutes for a table for two. It took an hour. The Guac was watery. I am guessing they did not drain the pico de gallo when they mixed it. Pretty gross. The chips were dry and unsalted. Plus it irritates me when places do not give free chips and salsa.  Positives: Good drinks and you have to love a place that offers sweet potato fries. I really enjoys my fried brussels sprout taco. Avocado Frito was meh."}
{"text":"Tex Tubb's has made a few changes over the last few years, and for the better. I waver between 3 and 4 stars, and I think I'd need to go back to evaluate.   When I looked over their menu, it appears that they did make some positive changes by changing to a superior torta bread & tortilla supplier, as well as more selections on the menu.  The majority of stuff on their menu is tacos, period!  One whole menu page of just tacos!  Each taco is described in lavish detail.  Most of them seem to have completely different ingredients than the other tacos; the el Pastor and Pineapple is marinated in Jarritos Pineapple and has pineapple slices, and then you'll see fried carrots in another taco.  The selection of tacos for vegetarians is very good, more extensive than at other Mexican restaurants in Madison.  You do have to pay for chips :(  There is a salsa bar, which is cool.  4 different kinds of salsa for you to choose at your leisure (You have to get up and get 'em).  I did order chips, guac, and queso, and both dips were tasty.  Chips were crispy and warm.  Tacos: El Pastor & Pineapple. Pretty good, but not my fave.  I think I prefer a traditional pastor taco, I also didn't taste a significant pineapple flavor in the meat.  Crispy tilapia: it is nice that they give you an actual tilapia filet rather than a measly bit of shredded fish like some other places.  There's enough fish in this taco that it's actually somewhat difficult to keep it in the tortilla!  Cubano was excellent, nice smokey flavors.  BBQ was good, but not particularly notable.  Sides: I had rice&refried beans.  Same as any other joint in Madison.  The sweet potato fries were good--I don't know if they were made in house, but I like the creamy dipping sauce provided.  Drinks:  Good beer on tap selection, including both Texan and Wisconsin beers.  Was surprised that they had all night happy hour on Thursday, woohoo!  Frozen margarita for only $3, awesome deal. They have about 6 different margarita flavors as well as more premium margarita drinks.  Service:  Pleased with service.  Both the server and the runner were attentive and prompt.  I will have to go back to Tex Tubb's to get a better idea of their menu strengths, but so far, I'm happy; it seems that they have ameliorated some of the problems from a few years ago."}
{"text":"Tex Tubbs, you failed me today.  We like this place a lot, and usually it's great.  Today, they were having some terrible trouble in the kitchen.  We ordered, we got chips, and then we sat.  And sat. And sat.  No food arrived.  And no one came by to give us an update, or say they were sorry.  Instead the servers ran by as quickly as possible, avoiding eye contact.  Look, we get it, sometimes you're short staff.  It would help tremendously if you were (1) honest and (2) nice about it.  We wound up leaving after almost an hour, with no dinner in sight.  The families near us with hungry and tired small children didn't seem to be faring any better than we were."}
{"text":"Food was cold and the 12oz margaritas were way to expensive.  We just got 2 regular on the rocks and they totaled $15.  Come on they were not even top shelf.  Anyways, we got our food after a 30 minute wait and let's just say it was not hot.  Tacos were very small and barely anything in them.  I HATE complaining but this place is not what it used to be.  I didn't even know the one on University closed down.  Maybe we will try again this summer to see if it was just a fluke."}
{"text":"A regular ole hole in the wall in Madison, WI, that just happens to sell some good vegan options.    FLAUTAS BASKET: As an appetizer, I ordered vegan flautas. The vegan flautas come with either a black bean & corn filling or a roasted sweet potato filling. I couldn't decide on a flavor and they were gracious enough to allow me to get half of each. (There are 5 flautas in a basket and I believe I got 3 black bean & corn + 2 sweet potato.)  OMG These were SO delicious! I slightly preferred the sweet potato flautas because I love sweet things, but both are winners. I would definitely order this again, next time as an entree.  CHIPS & GUACAMOLE: The guacamole was very bland and boring. It needed more sea salt or cilantro, or something. I was utterly disappointed with this $8 guac, which would be better priced at $2-$3. I wouldn't order it again.  TACO PLATTER:  I ordered 3 tacos: Fried Cauliflower, Avocado Frito, and Fried Brussels Sprouts. I wasn't impressed with the tacos. I still can't figure out how each and every one of them manager to be so bland despite all of the amazing garnishes and ingredients. I don't know what's missing... Maybe the perfect salsa? If they can figure out how to amp up the flavor, I'd give them another try. I did, however, enjoy the flavor of their refried beans and rice (mixed together). Everything was vegan in this platter.   SALSA BAR: The salsa bar has a whopping 4 salsas. Insert side eye here. I'm accustomed to salsa bars having over a dozen salsas. 4 salsas is Taco Bell: mild, verde, hot, and fiery. They need to change the name to salsa row; salsa bar is misleading. All salsas are said to be vegan-friendly, even the \"milky\" looking one.  I also tried one of their limeades. I mixed raspberry and prickly pear and it was very tasty.    A few things that I didn't like: They don't have any vegan desserts and they don't have any Taco Tuesday taco or food specials.  We were sat in the back by the door that isn't used and it was freezing. They sat a heater next to us, but it didn't help a whole lot. There were only 3 of us, so I don't know why we were sat in such an odd location, away from everyone and everything... I found that to be weird. There was a bit of an unwelcoming vibe too, but I tried to brush that off.  The parking lot was small and parking was scarce. During the winter, that can be a pain.  I won't say that I'd never return, because I would, but there is room for improvement here."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place to eat. The decor is fun and it's always casual.   Love the food for tex-mex. the four types of salsa on the help yourself bar are good and it's nice to self-regulate the quantity.   It's a good place to go for almost any occasion."}
{"text":"Best Mexican joint in Madison. Loved the decor, the service and the food. My favorites were the breakfast tacos and the 4 types of salsas."}
{"text":"This place offers the unique community atmosphere that all of Atwood avenue provides. Their tacos are fairly large so order conservatively, but as always, tip well. I love their unique twist of using a salsa bar! Unlimited salsa is life. Compliment that with their Braised Beef Tacos?! You're set. Check out their happy hour deals! Pro-Tip: After a long thursday at work, come to Tex Tubbs, check in using yelp to get complimentary chips and salsa, and treat yourself with some three dollar margaritas! I highly suggest the mango or the strawberry margaritas!"}
{"text":"I LOVE tacos. All kinds of tacos. And this place delivered on tasty tacos. Can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos! Always great when you have a large selection to choose from. I got the hot mama and the crispy tilapia. Also the queso is super tasty! I'll be back soon:)"}
{"text":"Flavors never disappoint. My friend and I spend our brunch recommending our plates to other couples eating there, and everyone loved what they ordered and were having. Amazing service, super nice and sweet servers, lots of attention and execution to flavor. I will never stop recommending this place!"}
{"text":"Why doesn't this place come up as a vegan option on yelp? Vegan vegan vegan vegan vegan vegan. I hope that helped! VEGANS! EAT HERE!!!!  My husband and I went on a road trip to Madison this weekend. Honestly, to eat. Vegnews magazine featured Madison to be super vegan friendly, and it did NOT disappoint.  Thanks to vegnews, Tubbs was at the top of my list. SO many vegan options! I ended up with three different lovely vegan tacos for dinner, with rice and black beans as a side. SO MUCH FOOD! Especially when you have the margarita flight with it. YES my friends, you read that right. Margarita flight. They have lots of wonderful, quality margaritas on the menu. Then there's the fruity section. They are definitely made in big batches and spun in a slushy machine. BUT you get three flavors for eight bucks.   There is also a chips and salsa bar and the salsas are wonderful!  The next morning, we were back for brunch. I had the vegan french toast with grilled peaches. Super sweet and yummy. The only disappointment was that the menu said it came with ghost pepper maple syrup, and it was definitely zero spice, no real maple, plastic bottle 'breakfast syrup.'   Thank you, Tubb's, for existing! And for having gobs of vegan options for me!"}
{"text":"We started off our meal with chips and guacamole, which was my first mistake of the evening. After eating maybe 1/3 of the bowl, which was underwhelming, I dipped a chip in and discovered that the bottom quarter to third of the bowl was filled with liquid. Unappetizing brownish liquid. It was gross, and no more of the guacamole was eaten.  I ordered one baja cod (beer battered) taco, one roasted pork taco, and one southern fried chicken taco. With refried beans and rice as a side.  You know when you have food in a warmer (like refried beans) and after a while, a crust forms around the edges of the food because it gets overheated? Well,apparently someone scraped the sides of that food container onto my plate, because my beans were crusty throughout. There was a valiant effort to cover it up with cheese, but it was still clear that whoever made up my plate did not put their best bean foot forward. The rice was meh. Way too much corn in it, and the flavor was washed out. The tortillas on all the tacos seemed uncooked. Or like they weren't heated up before my plate was brought out. The cod was overcooked, and the slaw was sloppy--there wasn't much of it on there. It was the most boring fish taco I've ever had, and I had a fish taco at Del Taco once.   *cue disapproving Kermit face*    The fried chicken taco was okay, but there wasn't much to it. The chicken was almost dry, but the flavor was decent, and the sweet potatoes were fine. The roasted pork was a pile of overcooked mush, and where my other tacos were underfilled, this one was overfilled.  Not with tender pork, but pork mush.   I skipped the salsa bar, because it was so dirty. It kind of seemed as though they couldn't keep up with both the flow of traffic and keeping things cleaned up--or they didn't care--which seemed more likely when I saw that the bathroom was dirty and the toilet was clogged.  The highlight of our trip was our server Matt-- he was on point. Perfect service. But the food was way overpriced for how disappointing it was. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Thoroughly unremarkable but serviceable. I've eaten here a couple times when I was in a hurry. The food is filling but completely forgettable. I usually expect a little more out of a Food Fight restaurant.  What it boils down to is that there are cheaper Mexican or Tex Mex alternatives that are at least as good and in some cases far better.  Go here if you have a hankering for some Tex-Mex if you are nearby and can't think of anything better."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Margarita pitchers are awesome on the rocks (a little expensive, get frozen for cheaper but less tasty). Get the fried avacado tacos. Sounds strange but super tasty. Good local flavor."}
{"text":"Came to Tex Tubbs while visiting from out of town and was very impressed. They had a lot of vegetarian taco options which isn't very common at most taco places. I got the asparagus and fried cauliflower and much preferred the cauliflower - would definitely get again. Salsa bar was delicious - I love the option to choose my own rather than having to pick the salsa that works best for the table."}
{"text":"We went to the Atwood location.  Not impressed.  We all had Chicken Tacos and Chips & Salsa.  For one thing, they charge extra for Chips & Salsa.  Any other Mexican restaurant serves them up as part of the meal.  The tacos were swimming in water.  The chicken was not drained enough.  They completely fell apart.  They were also very tasteless.   We seem to pass them all the time so we figured we would check them out.  We are from Dallas and can really appreciate a good taco meal.  This wasn't it.   We will continue to pass them up."}
{"text":"A good amount of variety in tacos can be found in this nice little hole in the way. The salsa bar is included, so pace yourself. Chicken tacos are bland, pork is overcooked, but carne Asada is freaking amazing. I was here with a large party and between all 10 of us I believe we got nearly every taco on the menu and that was the overall opinion. Beef options are the best. The sauces are delicious and the staff is nice. Definitely reminds me of living in Texas, which is to say it is TexMex, not Mexican food."}
{"text":"Sigh - another restaurant going downhill in Madison. I don't know if Kevin Tubb is still involved here, but I suspect he isn't anymore since things have changed over the past year, and not for the better. Tex's used to have the best queso in town - and I know it was Kevin's recipe - but sometime in the past 12-24 months they changed the recipe and it is now bland and watery and a big step backwards. I'm sure it's cheaper to make, but damn, it used to be really good. The other thing we noticed is that there is way less of the good stuff (i.e. meat) in the quesadillas and burritos. The last time I was there, about 6 months ago, I actually peeled open my smoked duck quesadilla (which used to be packed with duck) to see if there was, indeed, any duck present, since all I could taste was onion and pepper. I haven't been back since, which is a shame because it used to be a regular stop for me, my guy, and my kids."}
{"text":"I love this place, the tacos are always good, but the last time I was there our waitress was as slow as snail and hardly waited on us. I have worked in many restaurants and can spy bad servers right away. If you are going to serve food you have to take care of your customers, their tips are what you want and your attitude plays a big part in that. I just don't get wait staff who don't want to wait on people. Perhaps you are in the wrong business? Also, the parking SUCKS! However the food and salsas make up for it!"}
{"text":"Tasty tacos in a slightly too-cute interior.  While the tacos were tasty (I tried three of the meat variety), I thought the rice and beans were a little bland.  I'll head back but if I'm craving Mexican, there are better options."}
{"text":"I love this place! I typically get the taco platter, and it's my recommendation when I bring friends here for the first time. You can choose a 2 or 3 taco platter (you can also do ala cart). You get to pick 2 or 3 different tacos, so you get a nice variety and get to try different flavors. The vegetarian tacos are amazing (My favorites are the fried cauliflower, sweet potato, and fried avocado). I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually get at least one vegetarian taco because they are so good. You can pick whether you would like corn or flour tortillas. (The default is corn, but you can ask for flour.) The margaritas here are really good; they have quite a variety! The other awesome thing is the salsa bar. You can go pick out all the different types of salsa you want to try. If you check-in on Yelp, you can get free chips and salsa. This place can get pretty busy on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner."}
{"text":"We went to and were greeting by friendly people.   We sat at the bar and the bartender Dakota was very helpful in explaining menu items.  Dakota made us great drinks.   We ordered 6 different kind of tacos.   They had several to choose from.   My favorite was the portobello mushroom.   Their salsas were wonderful!   Everything was great.  We will definitely go back when we are in Madison again.    Loved it!"}
{"text":"If you like roaches crawling over your food before it is made you will love this place. Absolutely disgusting! Oh and don't bother going to the bathroom they are horrible.   Someone complained about my review. I am sorry to you but the building is full of roaches. I have been in the kitchen. I have seen the roaches. It is disgusting. IDK Why I got flagged for telling the truth. I guess it's like they say. The truth hurts.   If you want me to say something nice here it is. The booze is good and cheap."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write about this place for a while now, and give them some well-deserved love. Margaritas? Checkety-check-check. They also serve other cocktails, but if it's Tex Tubb's, I'm having a margarita, and I'll have it from a pitcher or in my own special glass, please and thank you.  They offer melted cheese to dip your chip, and that is a very fine thing indeed. There's a salsa bar providing a fine selection of mild to hot salsas the whole family will enjoy. My personal faves are the green tomatillo base (medium) and anything they offer on the hot end of the spectrum.  I have a deep and abiding love for tacos, and if you don't eat meat and share this love, you will want the fried cauliflower taco. Get three of them. I have dallied with the carrot-and-ancho something taco, and even their Brussels sprout effort, but I will just tell you now that unless your taste buds pick up something more than mine did, they're just weird and not tasty. Entirely unlike the fried cauliflower taco, which is yummy.   The place is popular and busy and can be loud. But there are tacos and margaritas to focus on, and they really are the important things. Oh, there are probably other people with you at the table, too.... Tacos!!!  This place is a well-oiled machine for taco delivery. Friendly and efficient service, no matter how busy they are. Tacos!!!"}
{"text":"I really could not find one thing wrong with this place. We went here on a Friday night about 7:00 for a birthday celebration. There was a short wait, but it was a nice night so we did not mind standing outside until our table was ready. We all had a cocktail, mine being a Margarita which was on the rocks, and very tasty. We also had chips and salsa for an appetizer. I like that they have a salsa bar where you choose your salsa from several options. Three of the four we tried had lot of heat (which I love!!) but some may find them too hot. We consumed two baskets of chips while waiting for our meals. I ordered the El Cubano Taco platter, and it was delicious!  You can get it with two or three tacos, two were plenty for me.  The tacos were pork on corn tortillas, full of flavor. The platter comes with a choice of sides, but I went with black beans and rice. They both tasted fresh, and the black beans were exceptionally good. You may say \"how good can black beans be?\" but these had taste, were not mushy, and definitely not from a can. I ate every bite on my plate. My husband had the Frito Burrito with chicken, which he let me sample.  I always use the \"I need to try it for the Yelp review\" excuse to taste other's food!  First of all it was MASSIVE in size, and very tasty. He had no complaints either and the burrito was gone at the end of dinner.  Since it was my son's birthday, we asked about birthday treats and they offered him a shot of tequila, which I thought was a nice touch.  Our waitress was on top of her game, checking on us and refilling water.  The water was much appreciated after sampling the salsa!  The place was packed the entire time we were there.  Bottom line...a good time was had by all, tasty food was eaten and we cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch after the crazy legs run, with a couple who said this was one of their favorite spots. We didn't know about checking in with Yelp for free chips & salsa, but the chips and salsa were really good. I loved the homemade salsa, and definitely took home a few containers of it with my leftovers.  I had the two taco platter with a green chicken chile taco & a pork belly taco. Both were great. This place is casual and they really stick to the tex-mex theme. It's a little out of the way from downtown, but at least that means easy parking."}
{"text":"Have not been to Tex Tubb's in almost four years we decided to give it a visit this past weekend.  It was packed but we had a table within 30 minutes which was great!  We used the Yelp check-in for free chips and salsa (delish)!  The margaritas were fantastic, I had both their house margarita and the prairie fire, both were great!  The food was OK...not bad but not very good...that being said it is a fun atmosphere and not overly expensive with great drinks and good chips and guacamole!"}
{"text":"When Tex Tubb's opened it was so exciting. A taco place within a five minute walk from the house. Unfortunately, the excitement was short lived. I've had several less than stellar customer service experiences there, and the food just isn't worth the price. It's not disgusting or anything, but just not that great. I've always thought it was a bit odd that the owner charges a cover ($5.00) when his own band plays at his own establishment. What's up with that? Maybe two to three bucks, but five bucks is a bit steep."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos.  Not \"authentic\" but don't pretend to be.  The tacos are delicious and creative.  A great choice for vegetarians and omnivores alike. A good stop for a late dinner."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for Tubb's yet! This is one of my most favorite restaurants ever.   The food is amazing. The menu is very creative and very inclusive for those with various sensitivities or exclusions. Gluten Free, Vegetarian, Vegan. Just about anyone can find something on the menu that will work for their diet.   When Tubb's started serving brunch I just about lost it, I was so excited! I went twice in one weekend! (Yikes, lol!) The ghost pepper maple syrup is AMAZING. And breakfast tacos. Need I say more?? Breakfast. TACOS.  The marg's are delicious - the flight is the way to do it. 3 small (but not really small) frozen margaritas in the flavors of your choice. The non-frozen margaritas are also fantastic. Good beer selection, and a whole bunch of specialty cocktails all make it rather hard to decide!   A few of my favorite dishes include: -Black Bean & Corn Flautas -Tamale Platter -Sizzlin' Fajitas -Frito Burrito (SO BIG, easily 2-3 meals worth)  The tacos are amazing! You can pick and chose which you want to create a 2 or 3 taco platter. They don't have to be the same!  -Chorizo & Black Bean (Favorite of mine!) -Backyard BBQ -Moked Brisket  And don't forget the queso to start things off!   Also super friendly staff, speedy delivery of delicious food, and quick refills on sodas, beverages, etc. And the interior is awesome! Fun and colorful!"}
{"text":"I had my 40th birthday party here after going there a couple times.  It was fantastic!  They handled 36 people on a Saturday night, and were tripping over themselves to serve us.  Food was delicious and my friends, all foodies couldn't get over how there was never an empty Margarita glass the whole night.  Diana, the manager, simply rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Added bonus to lunch here-a Yelp check-in coupon for free chips and salsa.  The chips are hot and crunchy and there is a salsa bar so you can choose the level of salsa you want.    Our service was fast and friendly- our Diet Cokes were replenished before they ran out-which is great as there is some heat in the food and I had to sip often from my icy beverage.  I had a chicken burrito bowl which was amazing, yet a tad spicier than I choose.  I can't lie, I'm one of the heat wimps that prefers my salsa con queso or mild, so the one suggestion I would have for the place is to have a \"spicy radar\" on the menu or the option to kick down (or up!) the heat on their plates.  But the quality of the food was great and even if it was spicy I did enjoy my food, not to mention my date loved his."}
{"text":"Went for dinner the other night.  The salsa bar is the best part of the meal.  We both got the Frito Burrito.  LOTS of filler - rice/beans. Don't know that we'll go back."}
