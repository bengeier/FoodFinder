{"text":"So impressed by the food and especially the service. I had a birthday party here and couldn't have asked for better service from the staff, both with the planning and on the night of the party. The food and drinks were fantastic, and the staff were laid back and eager to make it a great party. I'll be coming back for sure and recommending this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Monday with some friends.  I ordered the special, which was a lamb steak, but it was more fat than meat.  I was still pretty hungry after finishing. My wife had tacos and wings and loved them, and my friend had fish and chips (which impressivly came with two pieces of fish).  I will go back again, but I didn't have the best meal this time.  They have a great patio to go to, when summer rolls around again."}

{"text":"Taking up the space that was Red Fish, Huntsman Tavern serves up elevated gastropub fare and its price points are good. With leather booths, dark tiled walls, and a wide bar at the back, it's likely you're in for a comfortable meal.

Aside from the market priced meat, everything on the menu is $22 or less and divided under three sections as small/medium/large plates.

SMALL PLATES
The potted duck (a duck rillette) and the steak tartare, while perfectly fine, weren't especially notable. They are, however, extremely well-priced at $6 and $8, respectively.

MEDIUM PLATES
The chorizo corndog - a surprisingly interesting and tasty snack. With pickled onions, egg, and pummery, it's a little spicy with its ground chorizo interior and a a bit crunchy from it's crunchy exterior. A decent-sized snack.

The hot-smoked trout cakes - three pea pancakes topped with trout and creme fraiche. They were okay, but not a re-order. A serviceable canape.

Their crispy wings are smoked and fried and come with a house BBQ sauce of consisting of Sirracha and ranch. Really excellent wings - the meat was moist and tender, and even with the saucy sweet and spicy exterior, the skin still retained a bit of crunch from the fryer. Would order these again and almost made me order the fried chicken because of how good they were. But... there was more food coming.

I was very excited to try their tourtiere hand pies and I was not disappointed. A mix of pork and wild boar in a tallow lattice crust and sided with a tomato-cranberry relish. Definitely something to re-order. Quite enjoyed the flavours and the flakiness of the pie pastry.

LARGE PLATES
They had a house-made pappardelle with \"cheeky\" ragu on menu and of course, I had to order it. While good, I felt like it wasn't as strong as the other large plates that we ordered. Thought the pasta would go awesome with the stew instead.

My absolute favourite of the night was the Huntsman stew: braised short rib, venison, and pie dough crackers on the side. Such great and deep meaty flavours, as well as that lovely collagen-thick texture of the stew. A great and hearty winter meal that really needed a beautifully crusty white bread to sop it all up. Still, we made do with the spoon after the crackers were gone.

A surprise for me (though why after the wings) was the fish & chips. A lovely and light tempura batter surrounding a moist and flaky cod. So nicely flavoured and perfectly textured, I didn't even dip into the remoulade sauce! Sided with so-so salt & vinegar fries. Which I mostly ignored in favour of the fish, anyway.

DESSERT
A very tiny dessert menu: apple pie, lemon tart, and a cheese plate.

The apple pie was a fried pie reminiscent of the old-school McDonald's treat of yore. Nice, crispy, a little heavy, of good apple taste. Just not my thing.

The lemon tart was much more my speed and much less a tart than expected. A low jar of lemon cream that was just a shade grainy (though nothing that would impede me from eating it) and with a very nice mellow lemon flavour. This was accompanied by two rather tasty butter (shortbread?) cookies.  I quite enjoyed this one but almost felt that I should have gone for the fried chicken instead.

They've just opened and are working out some process kinks - so be prepared for a slightly drawn out meal - but this is most certainly worth a visit. A great mid-priced restaurant that's serving up some excellently executed dishes. Overall, this is a definite recommend from me."}
{"text":"I drove from London to Toronto to check out this spot base on reviews.  The servers were fun with lots of personality, the atmosphere was very cozy.  The food was perfect.  If you're an uptight knob that takes yourself to seriously it may not be to your cup of tea, which works out nicely because you'd just ruin the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try the brunch, but left before we even had a taste of the food. Received a lukewarm welcome upon arrival, and were then left sitting in our seats for about 10 minutes with a couple of glasses of water and still no order taken. (Also, only one set of cutlery was brought for a table of two and, at this pace, it was looking like it might take a while to get another). A second party of two arrived several minutes after us and was seated. Shortly after, the waiter walked by us and went to their table to take their order. That's when we decided to go somewhere else. This place is really going to have to improve their service if they expect to make a go of it in this town."}
{"text":"Granted, one may not expect a non-meat-eater such as myself to particularly enjoy something called the \"Huntsman\" Tavern -- however, my carnivorous parents also had plenty of complaints about the place. Thank goodness there are a couple of vegetarian options. I had the lasagna, which came with a small side salad of arugula, which was the tastiest thing on the plate. The lasagna itself was fairly bland. One of my parents had the burger - which was mediocre - and the other had the spring pasta with prosciutto, which was so dry that it ended up getting left behind on the dish. I really wanted to like the place, as I just moved in down the street, but I don't think I'll be returning. The quality just wasn't at the level that I would expect from the prices."}
{"text":"I had dinner at The Huntsman last night because it is right in the heart of my neighborhood.  

As a previous poster highlights:  THE STEW.   I honestly think the stew will have a cult following.  There are two stews.  One is a white bean, kale, manchego stew and it is served with a light flakey biscuit submerged in the crock.  I can't believe it is a vegetarian stew (including the broth base).  It was so unbelievably good.

The Huntsman stew was a venison shortrib stew and also really packed a complex - but not clogging - flavour profile.  If I had to choose, even though I'm an omnivore, I'd go for the white bean stew.  I've honestly never enjoyed a soup or stew as much as that one.

The rest of the food was delicious.  Highlights:  the lamb meat pies, the fish & (light batter and not a hint of grease seeped into the fish itself), the breadpudding (perfectly seasoned and moist, also vegetarian), and the apple pie.

The price point was surprisingly reasonable and the portions were large.

I will definitely be back for brunch as the area desperately needs another brunch option.  The brunch menu posted had full meals in the $9-$14.00 range.

Very attentive service."}
{"text":"We just walked in and grabbed a spot on the patio which is awesome on a quiet side street, in the shade. It was perfect for our group of three with an infant. Lots of space - highchair etc. 
We ordered the chicken and waffles which we thought were delicious - the waffles are a neat kind of scone type batter with REAL maple syrup. I had the Gatherer which was an awesome bowl of Kale, Cremini Mushrooms, Cheddar and two beautifully fried eggs. Well seasoned with a delicious savoury seasoning - salty/sweet/spicy. Typically I don't like my yolk runny - but this dish was seriously perfection. The last member of our group had a dish with ale sausage, scrambled eggs, mushrooms - it was delicious and perfectly cooked. He also had a side of the pancakes, again with real maple syrup and the delicious scone-like texture. 
Everyone at the table LOVED it. The coffee kept flowing. Water was served immediately on the warm patio. All in all for prices between $11 - $14. This is an awesome brunch place. If you were to go to one of the 'trendy' brunch places (ie. School) you would be paying 3x this price for a breakfast that doesn't even come close to comparison. 
I got home and emailed all my friends to check it out. Especially because of the space - my friends with kids - definitely stroller friendly on the patio.
We'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"i was here and ate the food.  i liked the food when i ate it.  the food was good.  i like steak and ribs.  ribs were really good.  steak was good too.   other good things are wings and pizza.  huntsman does not have pizza, but their wings are good.  i like the fries too.  i also like the hunter on the weekend, and the eggs with yellow sauce.  when i grow up, i want to be a man that hunts."}
{"text":"Was very excited for this place to open - and it is still only a few weeks old. so I hope it improves. It's a beautiful space with a great looking menu. The people working there are all very nice. The problem I had was with our food and service quality on two occasions (dinner and lunch). Unfortunately, when you've got a negative experience it really takes over as the main thing you think of when recalling your meal. The following stand out moments:

-Both occasions food taking longer than it should (nothing unusual ordered here: stew, a steak, chicken sandwich)
-Both occasions had to send back food (Dinner: two plates of steak not hot. Came back out with little improvement.)
-Steak was supposed to prepared to just under medium-rare, but came out more medium-well.
-Dirty plates not being cleared from table (at a two-top, so there wasn't much room)
-Had an interaction where the wrong side-dish was brought out with my sandwich, and instead of just bringing out the correct side, the server wanted to take away my sandwich to re-plate. I said, no, I'm hungry, please just bring out the new side, I'll eat the sandwich (I don't imagine they were going to re-use these fries). She was very reluctant to this solution (which seemed reasonable to me) 
-Chicken Sandwich bun reminded me of  wonder-bread (I'm sure it wasn't...but) and was thinking about how delicious a nice milk bun would have been instead.

Things that stood out in a good way:

-Everything on the menu looks like it should be delicious
-The space is well designed for groups in for a meal or just a 1-2 at the bar or in a small booth. It also looks great.
-Expansive and nice looking patio 
-Good spot for a late night drink
-The elements of the meals that weren't messed up tasted great. Kale, fries, olives, side salad, all delicious.

I would love to go back for a drink (which were all reasonably priced) but would probably hesitate ordering a full meal until I hear a few positive reviews from friends."}
{"text":"Loveless beer list--brand name brews boring. 
Dry burger--tasted like a fine burger from a mid-range chain hotel. 
Dry Chorizo in the corndog
--kinda takes the comfort out of the whole thing. 
Tired Concept. 
Cursed Address. 
Decent cocktails. 
Totally good service. 

(Maybe a shorter menu, with more quality control, and some craft beers and we can talk.) 

You just can't pretend that you aren't riding a (nonetheless pleasant) cliche though. Real love is for innovators."}
{"text":"Had brunch at The Huntsman Tavern this past weekend as I've been hearing some buzz about it, and needed someplace new for Brunch.

We got there pretty early, so were one of the first guests of the day. Checked out the menu - some interesting options...  we were a group of four that tried a variety of items...

The pancake of the day was apple pie, 4 of 'em to an order. a solid 8/10 - they were fluffy, cooked through and came with butter and maple syrup....

The beef chuck burger was topped with double smoked bacon, roasted garlic alioli and tomato...although my compadre said that she wouldn't have changed a thing because it was extremely delicious, she gave it a solid 8/10.

They have a standard eggs, toast, beans and potato hash with choice of meat. Solid 9/10...it was a great portion size, was able to get poached eggs and getting potato hash instead of 'breakfast potatoes' was great. the poach on the egg looked just perfect.

Finally, I just had to get the corned beef hash bowl thing. it comes with corned beef hash (with potatoes), layer of baked beans, some cheese and two perfectly deep fried poached egg. now, i've seen these deep fried poached eggs, but have never tasted one. it was perfect, awesome and delicious.

my only small complaint is that the hash was a bit on the salty side. however, it did not stop me from eating the whole GD thing.

it's a great spot, great food and great staff.

go here."}
{"text":"Sounds like we arrived on an off night. Terrible experience. Only the second time in my life I have ever walked out of a restaurant before getting to the entree.

Bad seating, rude and inept waitress, interrupted order, and undercooked greasy frites slapped together with a side of mayo (for $5!) had us feeling like we were going to leave disappointed. Tried to flag the waitress down who didn't check-in once after serving, but she was too busy goofing off with kitchen staff (in plain view).

We decided to run for it. Barkeep was gracious enough to comp our drinks. Still', wouldn't ever come back."}
{"text":"Great for a couple of casuals. The atmosphere is great- super relaxed and I really have enjoyed the food the few times I have gone. The duck taquitos amazing, the chicken wings-a must try, the navy bean stew was so nice on a snowy day that every time it snows , I find myself craving it and the fried chicken is some of the best I have had in the city."}
{"text":"Nothing quite beats a neighbourhood tour with my best Yelp gal-pal Evelyn W! After hours of tireless work(he he he) in a quaint downtown coffee shop (review to come), we realized that not unlike Winnie the Pooh, there was a rumbly in our tumbly, and with healthy happy appetites we were a pair of healthy happy Poohs!

**word of warning I just watched Winnie the Pooh with my 7 year old cousin, and I apologize for all movie references past and to come**

We walked briskly on the left over caffeine energy in our system to this brand spankin' new Dufferin Grove neighbourhood gastro-house! It's so new that the patio is still in unfinished wood. That being said they must have spent big bucks on making the inside of this place look older and well loved. As opposed to feeling like I was in swanky new Toronto hot spot where I would likely have my paycheck stolen by heffalumps and woozles (sorry) for a mere snack, I felt like I was having lunch in a local spot that had been here for decades (and remarkably well kept). I felt comfortable, relaxed and totally in my element here!

The lunch menu is concise, which I appreciate because as hungry as I was, I was not in a decision making mood! Lady Ev ordered the Ruben (I'll let her tell the tale of the sandwich) and I had their Smoked Chicken sandwich (as recommended by our server). 

The chicken sandwich was very good. A full, moist chicken breast placed between a Bic Mac style hamburger bun (they're so smooth) and topped with lettuce, cheese, what I believe was roasted red peppers and a similar flavoured sauce. Price wise it was on the higher end of average for lunch, but still in the average range. As for the sides, the fries were OK, I think they were fresh cut, not my fave, but I didn't dislike them either as they came fresh made and piping hot to my table. 

As a note I believe their service time (which was a concern at the beginning) has improved, as we were greeted, seated, and orders were taken and delivered quickly and efficiently! Best of luck to this new spot - can't to see what else you've got in store!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"When I read the words 'kale', 'old cheddar' and 'potatoes' stringed together in the same sentence on a menu then you know it's game-over for me; those ingredients combined made The Gatherer and it was delicious.

Surprisingly, the place was pretty chill for a Sunday morning but it was great for us because we had the terrace to ourselves for a bit. 

I didn't quite get a chance to admire the inside of the restaurant but the bathrooms were nice, which is always a good sign! 

As for the staff, this is where I have to be a jerk, I have to say that there is nothing more aggravating than asking the server for coffee three times when you REALLY WANT/NEED COFFEE AS A KEY TO YOUR EXISTENCE."}
{"text":"I hate the rating idea of ratings as it rests on a very temporal dimension of ones immediate service, Having said that I was yelpified by the service that evening. I had parked my car within viewing distance of the pub, and the bartender Reed noticed my car parked across from the Huntsman and had taken it upon himself  to prepare my standard order of a Sazerac before I entered. It was beyond the normal regular experience, I entered and the cocktail was served to me in seconds of taking a seat. I don't expect that on a regular basis but I was impressed with that level of attention to customer service. Become a regular you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but the nicoise was amazing and the wings too. Good service, smoking patio and OK prices, happy it's in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Super, super impressed. Circumstances led me to eat there two nights in a row during their soft launch. This location is essentially haunted, which is the only explanation I can come up with for it's incessant turnover. Red Fish, I was told, was very good and still did not survive. So: here's hoping that given the excellent food and service, The Huntsman will be around for a while.

I was participating in a bit of a College Street pub-crawl and hoping for something to eat at The Emmet Ray, only to discover they're presently without a chef. We were heading over to the Caledonian, but passed by the Huntsman and saw that it was finally open (literally had just opened a few hours prior for the first time.) The decor is trendy without being overly self conscious (coughWESLODGE-coughcough) and the booths are extremely comfortable - big enough for six. This will be a great warm and cozy spot for dinner through the cooler months.

The menu is split into Small, Medium Large. Small: olives were warm (nice touch) and came with some pickled grapes and veg on the side. Medium: fried chicken dinner nears Stockyards quality, cooked sous-vide (tender as hell) and comes with a really nice potato cake, that in reality rounds this out to a full meal. Hand-pie, I was told was excellent, and perhaps fills the lard-infused meat-party void left by the removal of pot pies from the Ray's offerings. Large: the Huntsman stew was totally killer; I did hear some requests at the table for less meat, more vegetables, but honestly, who says that?! 

Burger looked good (don't think you can get it rare here, so it won't be my thing) and I had a veal-cheek ragu on homemade parpadelle that was perhaps not as rich as I was hoping, but still very good. We previewed the brunch menu: a few things look insane tasty and we're planning a visit ASAP. Yelp, I shall keep you posted! It won't be long until a Saturday brunch here will come with an hour long wait. 

Wine list is excellent ($45-100ish) with bottles we've only seen in a handful of other (good) restaurants in town. We didn't try the cocktails, but they look proper enough.

The service, though, takes it to top-notch status - it's that effortless, very casual service that manages to be caring, attentive and well-informed at the same time. Allows you to be in a very, very relaxed state. You can tell everyone has tasted the food and everyone is excited about it, you can tell everyone is experienced. It's the little things: a large bag stowed in a private closet for us, the contact information for a wine importer provided (without request!) and a delivery of free apertifs and cake because it was my birthday. Genuine happiness to see diners, genuine desire to know what we thought, genuine warmth. They know their stuff. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I dropped in for Sunday brunch, had a craving for runny eggs over toast and potatoes done pretty much anyway so that they were crisp.

It was a semi cloudy day and the space was a bit dim upon walking albeit there were hanging Edison lights. Definitely possesses the vibe and atmosphere I would dig a lot at night, if I were to go out for a drink or two, perhaps even dinner. A tad, dare I say, dreary otherwise. 

The menu is simple, short and straight forward. Perfectly, they had Eggs Benedict and I had to go with their smoked trout for protein instead of the corned beef. It was delicious - hit the spot especially with those crispy home fries. I also tried the fried chicken and waffles, which were also delicious. If I were to return, I'd try \"The Gather\" even though I am a carnivore at heart,  I'm still a sucker for hash and kale.

Overall, I dug the food, the service was great and I felt comfortable eating there. It wasn't busy- 3 other occupied tables scattered about and it felt cozy. Atmosphere doesn't exactly shout brunch or happiness (which are things I like, or like to feel when I have brunch). But that's just me being picky I guess."}
{"text":"Ok this place was good but it's not my fave. I got the white bean stew and it just seemed really dry. The flavours were OK but the overall dish need more sauce. I also got the salt and vinegar fries which were pretty good but it was such a small portion for $6, but I guess that's their deal, small portions for a lot of money. Plus there was no pilsner on tap."}
{"text":"I've been getting really lucky with restaurants lately.  This is a wicked spot to eat well, drink lots and have a great time with the staff.  Let's just say that they have a black light in the back and occasionally like to have a dance party lol always good for laughs.

Service was excellent and the food was really good.  My friends and I decided to order 3/4 of the menu and share it.

We got the olives, oysters, steak tartare, wings, fried chicken, meat pies, trout cakes, pasta, meat stew, and I am sure more lol everything was amazing.

Top 3: steak tartare, friend chicken, meat pies

They even have a family style dinner with prime rib and the fixings but you have to call 3 days in advance.  I think we are doing that next time :)

Highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to come here for quite a while after reading all about it. And I gotta say I was a bit disappointed.

The food, I didn't see this huntsman stew that was written about so much. No worries, cause the fried chicken description had me salivating for it; they give you two large pieces of dark meat, biscuits and gravy and some coleslaw. But the batter on this chicken had dark bits on it indicating to me perhaps old oil and the batter fell off the meaty too easily. The biscuit was nice though as was the cabbage,

One thing I found though about the menu for food was that I didn't find anything really popped out at me except the fried chicken. You know when you look at a menu, look at the descriptions and the price and the menu item chooses you? I found it hard to get this feeling here.

Their beer list was probably sufficient for a place like this, probably six things on tap.

The service though was a bit disappointing. The guy who helped us was attentive and came by enough; but he had this demeanor and vibe that felt a bit rude and pretentious. I was not a fan of it."}
{"text":"Glad to see this place up for sale. I guess the rude and condescending nature of the staff didn't go over well in the neighbourhood. Good riddance Huntsman Tavern!  Let this be a lesson on how not to treat your customers like garbage!  Looking forward to the change.

Update: the windows are boarded up. Ding dong the witch is dead!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night.  Sat down at 8pm, ordered around 8:30 and finally got our Entrees at 9:35pm after a very very long wait... If there's a large party here don't expect food to come quickly.  It was a bad sign when after 40 minutes of waiting with no sign of our appetizers our waiter reappeared and warned us that we were behind the large group that was also here.  Luckily, neighbouring tables with small groups like ours were also left without food until the large group had been fed... so I didn't feel like we were the only table that was suffering.

I had the bread pudding which I enjoyed - perhaps because I was starving by the time it arrived.  I also had the tempura cod which I would not recommend.  I found the batter to be bland and didn't bring out much flavour from the overcooked cod.  The tartar sauce was embarrassing - it looked like it was someone else's leftover: the small container came to me half-full - there was maybe a tablespoon to work with.  It too had little to no flavour.  The only redeeming thing on my plate was the coleslaw which was pretty good.  The fries were cardboard-like.  I was very disappointed - especially having waited so long.

Other people in my party ordered the shortribs and fried chicken and they seemed to enjoy their food.  Overall the experience was a big meh for me."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 20 on a Friday night. The service was on point and the waiter got everything right, including the drinks that kept flowing as we ordered them - that in itself is a positive! Good work to that team for handling us so well. 

What a great little menu. I mean little quite literally - the menu is small. But while the menu is small there is plenty to enjoy, from gamey stews, to fried chicken, all the way to homemade pasta. I had a craving so I got the fish and chips. The cod was cooked perfectly, however it needed more seasoning as it was quite bland. Those who ordered the fried chicken stated the same thing - cooked perfect, under flavored. I think the only dish I heard about without complaints was the stew with venison and wild boar. It looked incredible - kinda which I ordered that. 

Now, one thing I have to say is that this place, in no way resembles a lodge, or a huntsman cabin. Blue tile with a few antlers does not make you a tavern. Don't get me wrong, the decor was nice, but it was not true to the name of the restaurant. 

I would give this place a 3.5 if I could, but because of the service I'll round up to a 4. There is some room for improvement, and I think they're well on their way of being a 4-5 star spot. 

If you're in the area it's def worth a try."}
{"text":"Tried this new gastro-pub last week and loved being there. The decor, the beautiful light fixtures above the bar, the warm wood and low lighting was very welcoming. As you would imagine, a place called the Huntsman was full of...you guessed it...bearded hipsters. Not that that's a bad thing but it was the crowd if you were wondering.

My BFF and I sat at the bar and drank some wine - not the greatest list but they said they were out of the first two we tried to order because they were changing their list so hopefully when I go back there will be more depth to the selection. We weren't crazy about the bottle we did get but we drank it all the same. We finished up with Jamesons so we made it work!

So I loved being here and wanted to give this more stars but as a vegetarian looking at a very small menu, there was very little to eat. There was a white bean and kale stew but it didn't interest me. I tried the fish and chips as I eat some fish and really had no other choice. But first I started with a ricotta, roasted tomato and grape green salad with pecans that was pretty bland. The fish and chips was also bland. The tempura batter was ok but there was very little taste to the fish and I was disappointed with the salt and vinegar thin cut fries. My BFF had steak frites and her fries were delicious so if I'm back I'll definitely order the regular fries. She also got this delicious home made ketchup that they had served with her appetizer (corn chorizo dog that she loved) and they gave me regular old Heinz. My BFF liked her steak and corn dogs so perhaps this just isn't the place for a vegetarian. Yes, I see the name is Hunstman and I'm not surprised, but it doesn't account for me being disappointed with not just the choices I had but the actual food. Bland on both courses with mediocre wine.

That said I just loved being there and am sure I'll be back to try again. Here's hoping the wine list improves and the menu changes with the seasons."}
{"text":"We came for brunch. I though the food was good - this place will be a nice, reliable go-to in the neighbourhood. I thought the server was rude and this really put a damper on the experience."}
{"text":"Don't go here for anything other than a drink.  We arrived at 5:30 pm on a Sunday and were told that they were out of 3 things on their limited menu.  There was one waitress for the entire patio and the credit card machine was down!  They told me to go to the ATM down the street!  Would not go back!"}
{"text":"The Huntsman Tavern (@TheHuntsmanTO) have been open for a few month at the former space of Red Fish which was rather short lived.

The new owners definitely did a great job revamping the space from the wall lined with small shiny blue tiles that reflect all the bare hanging light bulbs and the decanter lights by the bar was a very nice touch.

The menu is designed by Chef Mike Tan (Oddseoul, The Saint) which had done amazing job combining soul food with a British flare while the cocktail menu by Aja Sax (the Emerson, County General)

Guinness $7.50
~ Ben just felt like Guinness which is one of his fave beer but they also offer a selection od seasonal Craft Beer here.

Baker Street $13
~ Jameson, Drambouie, Apple Cider, Chai Tea, Lemon
~ A very easy drinking cocktail but even thou I love the idea of an Apple Cider Cocktail and Chai tea, this falls a bit flat with very muted flavors of every single components.

Tourtiere Pies $13
~ Wild Boar, Tallow Crust, Tomato Cranberry Relish, Cara,melized Onions
~ Flaky moist golden crust with rich savory flavorful boar which was perfectly spiced, but together with the sweet tangy relish was what stole my heart. 

Chorizo Corndog $10
~ Pickled Onions, Poached Egg, Mustard
~ This was delicious, definitely not your regular corndog. 
~ Love all the flavors and texture here from the tangy mustard and pesto, the creamy goodness of the perfectly poached egg with a thin shell and the the yummy spiced savory chorizo.

  Fried Chicken $15
~ Sausage Gravy, Apple Slaw, Cheddar Biscuit
~ Love how this biscuit was drenched with the thick creamy gravy but the biscuit itself was not as flaky buttery as I was expecting and the bottom was burnt. 
~ On the other hand, the chicken was super moist inside and extra crunchy outside.

 Huntsman Stew $24
~ Braised Short Rib, Venison, Pie Dough Crackers
~ This was a very meaty dish, I was expecting around the same amount of meat and veggies but it's mostly meat here. 
~ This was Ben's dish but we do share everything but frankly I could never finish this by myself. Although it was very tender, I found it rather bland one dimensional.

Deep Fried Apple Pie $6
~ Créme Anglaise, Spiced Nuts
~ Love the idea and homemade look of this DF apple pie but found it not very flavorful. 
~ The filling didn't have much apple flavor nor caramelized sugary flavor that you get with baked apples. If not for the spiced nut and Créme Anglaise, I would not be able to finish this.

Verdict :
~ Some misses but I did enjoy most of the dishes.
~ Love both apps a lot, will come back for them in a heartbeat.
~ Very affordable and for a light dinner you can easily order 2-3 apps to share with a beer or two.
~ Service as very friendly and attentive throughout the night with our waitress checking on us and making sure water and cutlery was replenished.

P.S - They do daily Brunch service"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch recently and it was a good experience.  The interior is modern and friendly but didn't feel intimate.  Its a long rectangle that, while appointed, doesn't leave you feeling connected to the space.  

In terms of the food, the eggs Benedict was fantastic.  The sauce was flavorful without being overpowering and the smoked trout was inspired addition.  The potatoes were perfectly baked.  While not the best that I've had in the city, it isn't far off.   

So, for me, it was a solid hit on the food but a bit off on atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hunting for lunch around Dufferin Grove? Travel to this tavern... but maybe give them a little more time to get settled. 

I've been here twice and have had one decent and one not-so-great experience. The first time I was in I had the bean and kale stew. It was unbelievably salty, and I've been known to salt a NFLD pot dinner, so clearly I'm not a sensitive lass in this department. The second time I had the Reuban sandwich with the salt and vinegar chips. Delicious. Order with a side of grain mustard and wolf down without looking up. 

I don't like to comment on service after one visit to a new place, but I've been twice so I'm going to unleash a bit: I forgive growing pain issues, like debit machines not yet working, etc, but I can't get behind hipster coldness. The Hunstman, like many other neighbourhood joints, has overly relaxed, cold and bitter (whyyy?) servers. Is this a case of management hiring their friends for the wrong reasons? Have I just came in at the wrong moment? Hopefully it's just a case of getting settled, and they're just frustrated to not have everything down pat yet. 

The Hadley's breakfast specials I've been missing so much are on the menu, and I saw Hadley himself in the Kitchen so I look forward to coming in for brunch soon. 

PEPPER PREDICTS this place will be a well-oiled neighbourhood addition by the spring. What a patio!"}
