{"text":"My husband swears by Mecurios. My only problem is that I want more generous sauce and toppings. We totally agree they make the best crust and are the experts when it comes to gelato!  Where they fall short is how much sauce or toppings they add to your pizza. For what they charge, I would expect more in spite of the fact that they say they are genuine Italian pizzas. Another problem is that you cannot order extra anything on your pizza. 
We've eaten there at least 10 times and order the bruschetta and a pizza. The bruschetta is incredibly awesome. My fav is the lasagna pizza.  The pizza IMHO needs more everything. (Especially for the price!)"}
{"text":"Mercurio's: Authentic Neapolitan Pizza and Artisanal Gelato 

While visiting family and friends this weekend in upstate NY, my husband and I were sharing our infatuation for Mercurio's pizza.  Our declaration of love for this charming little pizza and gelato eatery came after dining on a sad pie from the local \"pizza shop.\"  Let it be said now, Mercurio's is not your average pizza shop.  It's more like a mini vacation to Italy.

Mercurio's is operated by Anna and Michael Mercurio (siblings).  It's obvious that this family run business cares about quality ingredients and the tradition of making food from one's heritage.  Michael is the head chef and is certified by the Italian government to make Neapolitan pizza.  Neapolitan pizza is distinct from other pizzas because Michael must follow certain rules.  I learned, after reading up on the guidelines on Mercurio's site, that the foundation of most pizzas is simple, fresh ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes for the sauce and mozzarella cheese.  The dough consists of wheat flour, yeast, salt, and water.  Michael is not allowed to use a rolling pin while ensuring that his dough is no more than 3mm thick.  He then bakes the pizza 60-90 seconds in a 485 °C (905 °F) stone oven with an oak-wood fire.  The flavors and textures you get from this specialty oven are incredible.

The toppings are also mind-blowingly fresh and healthy.  Sorry, folks, if you want a grease-laden mountain of processed meats you're in the wrong spot.  Rather, most pizzas are topped with items such as arugula, artichokes, Prosciutto di Parma, grape tomatoes, basil, and so on.  No napkin blotting or guilty feelings required when dining on this pie.

{"text":"Quality Comes At A Cost.

Okay, that's not entirely true, right? I mean, who hasn't seen Avatar? Prime example. Wads and wads of cash that could have been used to help starving families in this country were squandered on a lackluster film whose Cheese Factor would have risen only if it were a musical. It was a lame duck. A pretty duck, but a lame one.

So quality doesn't always come at a cost, but it does at Mercurio's.

The flavor selection is off the charts, causing the brain to atrophy temporarily into indecision only to be kickstarted again by the sheer incomprehensibility of the situation. 

Expect the following cycle:
Caramel green apple? -- yum, I want... -- OMG, mulberry with chocolate chunks? Mmm -- No! I want blueberry muffin... -- Ack! Brain... dying... can't... -- ... -- ... -- ... -- Raspberry & truffles? -- yum, I want... -- OMG...

Every flavor I've had is heavenly, sending me into a Stratosphere of Happy for the next 60+ minutes.

The only downside is their absurd pay-by-the-ounce scheme, which is really a bid for more money. When faced with so much Deliciousness, are you really going to say, \"I only want $2 worth?\" No, probably not. And, really, $2 worth of this insanely lip-smacking gelato isn't enough. Hell, $20 worth wouldn't be enough. 

So, Mercurio's: change the pricing, and I'm yours. 

Forever. 

I've already picked out your ring and the China pattern."}
{"text":"I ordered the Margherita pizza with mushrooms. I thought the sauce and the fresh mozzarella were both excellent quality and had good proportions. The mushrooms were also perfectly cooked and were nicely distributed over the pizza. I also appreciated that the pizza wasn't overly oily, like I find so many Margheritas tend to be. On the negative side, I thought the crust was extremely doughy. It was thin enough in the middle of the pizza so the doughiness wasn't as noticable, but the outer crust was super thick and doughy. The crust didn't have much flavor and was not the crisp chewy crust you'd expect to find with a Marghertia pizza. It was also on the salty side. Further, I wasn't quite sure, but the overall pizza was extremely salty. Nothing besides the crust tasted overly salted alone, so I'm guessing too much sea salt was sprinkled over the pizza. 
Aside from the food, our waitress was also very standoffish which was annoying."}
{"text":"Price are on the expensive side and pizzas are good, nothing else. People nice and helpful. They can works on decoration. Drinks were bad"}
{"text":"The food--excellent, the pizza & the gelato, first rate. 
but the service not so much.  I get take out once a  month or so, gelato a couple of times a summer & eat in every couple of months---and no matter what service is well, an afterthought at best, and just down right untrained and uninterested."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with my significant other. The food was absolutely spectacular! Our server was also A+. The stand out would have to be the gelato. I've been here quite a few times for the gelato, and I will continue coming back. It's so rich and creamy!

One of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"I've had pizza from here twice now and both times it was excellent. I wish they offered a little more on the menu. It's clean and the people that work here are friendly as well. Highly recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service.  Poor layout.  Some friends and I decided to head to Mercurio's on a whim.  Although many of the complaints revolve around the price of the food served here, I did not feel the costs were extraordinary.  I did, however, feel the food was mediocre.  I ordered the portobello salad that amounted to a huge over-salted pile of arugula with a measly mushroom on the side.  I also ordered the meat and cheese plate, which was adequate.  But, when we asked the waitress what cheeses were on the plate (1) she did not know and had to ask the kitchen and (2) after she asked the kitchen, she claimed there were 3 cheeses on the plate.  There were not 3 cheeses on the plate.  There were also little things that the waitress did that suggested a lack of attention and experience.  For instance, we asked for 3 glasses for the wine carafe because one my friends is clearly pregnant.  She brought 4.   We arrived a little after 5 and were seating immediately by the gelato counter.  Initially this was fine; but as the night wore on, the counter became increasingly busy and we ended up with rear ends at the backs of our heads."}
{"text":"Although the staff are a bit inattentive, as you could possibly stand there waiting for a table for a few minutes while the college aged waitresses walk by sweeping or cleaning menus, the food is to die for. I ADORE the pizza with truffle oil, prosciutto and mushrooms, the caprese salad is ripe and plump, and finishing off the meal with 4 different types gelatos (shared with my mom, of course) makes for a scrumptious night!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Pizza here, it's the best in Pittsburgh in my opinion, just as one would find in Italy with the wood burning oven. It's affordable and they offer outside tables in the warmer weather right in the heart of Shadyside. It get's busy and it's sometimes confusing with the flow of the guests dining in and those just wanting a gelato confusing the line, either way, both the pizza and gelato are good, who cares about the line. it's worth it for a good pizza with a glass of wine or a beer at an affordable price."}
{"text":"My favorite ice cream place in the city.  Technically this is a gelato place.  Creamy, strong flavors.  Nice place to go if you are wondering around the Walnut Street Shops in Shadyside."}
{"text":"The redeeming quality of this place is the gelato. Because it sure as shit isn't the $16 pan sized margarita pizza made by the local paper boy. Last time I paid $16 for dough and sauce was when I was at Pizza Taglio (see other review).  The pizza fate here suffers the same inconsistencies as every other new \"hip\" pizza parlor in Shadyside/EastLiberty/IDon'tCareWhere.  And that is, too little sauce used on a heaping pound of dough creates one of the biggest spectacles since the Drumpf presidency.  Tell Ralph, the pizza boy to spread the sauce evenly, add a bit more sauce and make THE FACKING CRUSTS SMALLER! That way you don't have a lake forming in the center of the pizza.  This place is a Shadyside staple for their ice cream gelato. And that's it. You're not flying over from Palermo for their pies. And if you are, then there is something wrong with you my fine feathered friend. They have over 20 different flavors of \"gelato\", and usually, on a Saturday, standing at the crest of Negley hill, deep in the heart of July, you can see a large line forming."}
{"text":"Great gelato! I loved the nutella flavor... perfect portions, too"}
{"text":"My first review about a restaurant in Pittsburgh and very disappointed to say it was the worst experience. Ordered Ameratto gelato and Bianca pizza. Gelato tasted bitter and the pizza was half cooked , served cold. Not coming here again for sure. There must better places on Walnut street to explore than this one."}
{"text":"We love this place!! The pizza is amazing, just like Italy.  We love that it is a family owned business with 3 family members there a lot of the time.   It's our boys' favorite place to eat in Shadyside."}
{"text":"12 dollars for 4 pieces of pizza. It is the worst tasting pizza I have ever had in my entire life. Burn this place to the ground."}
{"text":"Best pizza/salad/gelato in the area! Best place to come with your family, friends, or even a date. Pizza is authentic Italian, and salads are extremely filling and filled with all sorts of delicious additions. Gelato is to DIE for! They never fail to amaze me with the different flavors they have provided each time I come. Lastly, service is always amazing. I have only had one waitress that wasn't the nicest, but overall the staff is always the best !"}
{"text":"Apparently they are moving to another location next year, so once they open up their doors-I'm there!

This gelato is AWESOME! It is so smooth and delicious.

The only downside for me is that I LOVE ice cream, so I was a bit disappointed by their proportions. You can ask for as much as you want, but when I order a waffle cup with gelato, they put one tiny scoop in it. Maybe I'm just a pig, but it's not even equivalent to a scoopful at most other ice cream shops. It's a little embarrassing always asking for more...

But seriously, this place is delicious, try it."}
{"text":"Ice-cream here are soooo yum, not too sweet, the right natural flavor and the creamy texture.
And you have to try their Pizza, they are all handmade and homemade with the best Italian-certified ingredients. Based in the brick real fire oven. 
My favorite is the PIZZA DEL RE, with truffle spread, mushrooms and Prosciutto, brilliant combination."}
{"text":"My husband and I seem to find ourselves visiting Shadyside a lot especially now that the weather is better.  And we always seem to gravitate to Mercurio's.  The pizza is good, especially the truffle one, and wine to go with it is always nice.  The gelato's offered in the front are delicious.  This is one of our favorite little spots fast becoming a habit."}
{"text":"Been going here for 2 years and stopped awhile ago because everytime I ordered pizza, the bottom was too burnt. (Have found better, slightly more affordable similar pizza downtown at Stone Neapolitan).  I feel as though they have increased their gelato prices a bit, as well. Used to pay $3.50-$4.00 for a cup and now it's $4.50+. Still excellent salads, panzanella, fresh ingedients and gelato, though. Try the honey sunflower and pistachio gelatos--amazing!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here yesterday. We opted to sit out to enjoy the nice weather. Service was mediocre. First bad sign, table wasn't even cleaned. Next bad sign, water came in a dirty glass that the waitress only realized after serving it. We then ordered pizza with anchovies but got literally 4 anchovies on the whole pizza. The only good thing about this place is their ice cream."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza - we got 'PROSCIUTTO' it was good. Our friends got 'MARGHERITA' It looked great. Good atmosphere and nice service. People seem to be happy working there. The price is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"A little more expensive than I would have expected. If you split a pizza and don't have anything else you'll probably leave hungry. My friend from Italy said the pizza was like they serve it in Italy. The gelato is good."}
{"text":"Mercurio's is so stellar and I've had an excellent experience all ~10 times I've been here. The house salad is unexpectedly good--if you don't think it's possible to feel enthusiastic about a salad, try this one. 

For the pizzas, I'm particularly fond of the pizza del re--the delicate truffle flavor is so lovely. The margherita is straightforward and classic but very satisfying and balanced in flavor.

The gelatos are beautifully creamy and they have a really excellent flavor range and generous portion sizes. Highly recommend the fior di latte, nutella, and the dark chocolate cherry. Haven't tried all the flavors BUT I AM WORKING ON IT and I am very dedicated to the tasting cause, I assure you.

Service is always super efficient and friendly. I'm a bit worried I sound like a shill now, but Mercurio's is seriously very good and one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Having lived in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, I am spoiled when it comes to eating out. In any of these cities you can get a fabulous meal for a great price. Whenever I talk to friends from any of these cities, they always ask me about the cuisine, to which I say: Fries. Cold fries. Cold fries on your burger. Cold fries on your salad. None of my friends have come to visit. 

But now I have something to entice them with. Mercurio's is AWESOME. I have eaten pizza straight out of an outdoor pizza oven in the middle of wine vineyard in Tuscany and the pizza at Mercurio's easily tastes as authentic. We also had an appetizer of olives and bread, a carafe of wine, and a gelato to top off the meal. Our entire bill was 40 bucks. Terrific food does not have to be expensive, and it also does not have to be topped with fries. Thank you Mercurio's!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm.....I must go to Mercurio's every time I'm in Shadyside. I love that you can get multiple flavors, which is a big help for indecisive people like me."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza restaurants I've ever been too. Started with the panzanella salad which had a delicious dressing. Then shared the Margarita which tasted light and fresh and the pizza Del Rey, house made mozzarella, truffle spread and prosciutto - amazing! Ended with one of the award winning gelatos. Great meal! Our waiter Justin served us well, was friendly and full of good information about what kinds of fun things there are to do in Pittsburgh. We will be back"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh.  As close as you can get to true Neapolitan pizza without a trip to Italy.  Always fresh and delicious. Great service.  And homemade gelato for dessert!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Lots of potential for a traditional Italian pizza (and yes I've been to Italy). But the pizza was burnt and even after ordering double cheese, not enough!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever had; thin crust, light sauce and just the right amount of toppings. It is an affordable place to eat with pies salads and sandwiches ranging from $9 to $15.  They have the best gelato I have ever had with a gigantic variety of flavors.  This is one of my top 3 places for pizza in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I went in with my husband, brother, sister-in-law and parents for ice cream.  The young guy working the counter seemed friendly enough but there was a very young, thin brunette wandering aimlessly while the line stood waiting to place their order.  She walked away and then returned, still unsure about what she could be doing.  She made eye contact with the lady in front of me, so she must have felt pressured to take her order.  She gave her a cone and then returned to her aimless wandering.  I'm not sure what she is being paid for, maybe she just volunteers, in that case, she should go to the back because it's irritating to customers when what looks like an employee is just doing \"nothing\".  

There seemed to be a lack or organization or anyone taking charge making decisions about how to help the customers.

The two blond girls were busy working, the young guy, I mentioned earlier, and an older guy, maybe the owner, or manger seemed much more organized.  I would come back here because the ice cream is good and the size options are great but the customer service is questionable."}
{"text":"The most authentic Italian food in Pittsburgh.  Period.  They make their own Limoncello.  My husband is an Italian (native) trained chef.  Found things here that we have been looking for everywhere for months.  They know what they are doing.  Most customers probably don't have the experience to know how spot on they are.  Go there!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. And their gelato... Oh my gosh. HEAVENLY. Definitely worth going there."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood and favorite pizza place in the 'burgh. I love Neapolitan style and thin pizzas and this place totally delivers. In fact it's really the best Neapolitan I've ever had in the US. Not only that, they serve up an exceptional spread of gelati and sorbetto with seasonal flavors and in-house creations (they started as a gelato place, FYI). 

My wife and I have gone once or twice a month since moving here in 2013. When it comes to pizza I enjoy simple: delicious crust, succulent NOT salty sauce, and toppings that complement the pizza not overpower it. Mercurio's delivers on ALL THREE with each pizza that I've tried, with the always recommended Margherita (our #1 pick) or the funghi to the more richly flavored meat-topped offerings like the Salciccia i Funghi, prosciutto, or the truly decadent Pizza del Re. 

I highly recommend a house salad and splitting a pizza. You'll spend $15 to $20 and have a very good meal. Each bread this place makes is fantastic so if you need another flavor or just got tired of pizza (who does this?) then go for the eggplant or italiano or prosciutto paninis. 

Now, the breakdown of what I love about each part of their pizza----

Crust: always fresh cooked and crisped to perfection in their inside wood oven, never once had a burnt or undercooked piece, slightly acidic dough (almost french baguette level of acidity) with a crispy outer crust and soft airy warm inside. To me this is the CORE of the pizza and I have YET to find a tastier crust anywhere. 

Sauce: light tomatoe based red sauce, sweet and not heavily salted or herb infused, complements the crust and mozzarella cheeses perfectly

Cheese and oil: expect your pizza to be dressed lightly with mozzarella and olive oil, I LIKE THAT THERE'S NOT MUCH CHEESE because the flavor balance would be out of whack, also the olive oil adds a nice creamy texture and sweetness to the herb-topped and meat-topped offerings

Meats: huge fan of their ground sausage and also proscuitto. if you're getting meat, get one of these

Panini: personally big fan of the eggplant with bell peppers and zucchini, pretty regular summer lunch pick on a sunny day!

Gelati: huge fan of death by chocolate, lemon sorbetto, cherry bourdeaux, and dark chocolate straciatella"}
{"text":"Mercurio's is one of the better pizza places in Pittsburgh. Offering fantastic, thin crusted personal pizzas, this restaurant is great for those who want something interesting and flavorful.    Prices are a little on the expensive side, but I definitely think it is worth it. The service is friendly, but they could be more attentive.  In addition, their gelato is also fantastic and complements their pizza rather well.

Overall, this is a great place for weekend nights and can be really fun with friends.  I have gone many times and will continue to recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Bruschetta was great, as was the lasagna pizza.  Portions were smaller than expected but the quality was top notch.  The gelato is a great way to finish off the meal, the blueberry muffin flavor is especially delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm a little baffled by the high ratings for the pizza!  I have traveled the U.S. and have had thousands of pizzas.   This pizza is mediocre.   Bland sauce, 3 slivers of basil and a couple of small droppings of cheese on a dough that looked and tasted like a crepe!   Wife and I will pass!   There are Sooooo many other places in the burgh for better pizza!     The service was very good and  the gelato was yummy! That's where the 3 stars come  in!   We really wanted to like this pizza!  We ordered and literally 2 min later, pizza on table???"}
{"text":"Bob and I ducked into Mercurio's today after a long day of wandering around Shadyside.  We were stuffed from lunch but we ate a bit of gelato anyway, and here's why: one ounce is 64 CENTS.

My mind reeled as I took in the array of gelato tubs.  They have at least 24 flavors, more than I've ever seen at any other gelato place.  And all of them are made fresh locally!  I asked!

This is my absolute frozen dream.  Crazy variety, fresh, and CHEAP.  You can go in and ask for one ounce of five different flavors and end up paying under four dollars.

A quick comparison: a small size at Ben & Jerry's is 3.50-ish for four ounces, and you can only get two flavors per scoop.  Premium ice cream like Ben & Jerry's is made with heavy cream, and gelato is made with 2% milk at most.  This is why gelato equals more flavor (not as much butterfat coating your mouth) with fewer calories.  Yum.

I'm going back as soon as I can for a multi-flavor fix.  Today I tried pistachio and chocolate almond (for a total of 1.85), and they were both excellent.  I'm only getting started though.  There are enough delicious things in Mercurio's to keep me busy for a long, long time."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and we know our pizza. This place is unbelievable! Everything is so fresh! Flavors are absolutely ridiculous! Anyone that has a chance should take the time to visit! You'd be doing yourself a favor by doing so."}
{"text":"You need to get gelato when you come here! It is so creamy and rich, and they have quite a few flavors. The pizza was very good as well, with fresh toppings, but I feel like I will come back for gelato more often than for the pizza."}
{"text":"Worse coffee shop in Pittsburgh 

Internet didn't work the stuff could not help me 

Never again to this place"}
{"text":"I wandered in on a whim. Fantastic pizza! As long as you like your crust thin and chewy, anyway. The fresh mozarella- mmm!! I enjoyed the pizza della casa. I didn't think I was hungry enough to finish it, but I did. 

And the nutella gelato was utterly fabulous!! I also tried the mint chunk, which was fine, but it held no candle to the nutella."}
{"text":"I am a fan because you can totally get 4 different kinds of flavors under 2 dollars. They weigh the ice-cream by ounces. So you can totally say you want this, this, this and this flavor but all together in 3 ounces! And the options are limitless. I go there quite a bit (even have a frequent diner card) and the flavors keep rotating. The gelato is pretty delicious and healthy (being gelato) and you can absolutely indulge if u can/want to or get small portions if that's your style."}
{"text":"Loved their wood-fire Neapolitan pizza especially their Pizza del Re. 
Their pistachio and nocciola gelato are the best I've tried. They were full of nutty bits and were so flavorful without being too sweet. 
Excellent friendly service courtesy of Giulio."}
{"text":"Decided to wait out rush hour here tonight. Nice staff. My BF and I shared the Primavera Con Carne and the Pizza Del Re.  Both were good Neapolitan style pizzas.  I am not very partial to white button mushrooms, so I had to ask the server about the mushrooms on the Del Re.  They were white button, but the pizza was still awesome.  The truffle spread was RICH!  I personally don't recommend eating the Del Re by yourself.  Don't get me wrong, I'd order it again in a heartbeat..... but it would just be too much by itself.  Doing a salad and half this pizza for two people would be the right amount.  Or like I did, mixing in the Primavera Con Carne which had the acidity from the tomato sauce and the marinated artichokes to cut the heaviness of the Del Re.  We finished with a sweet and creamy, yet tart acidity Key Lime Pie gelato, which was heavenly.  The girl behind the counter said that she was happy that I did a taste test of the key lime and liked it.  She said it was her favorite, but 90% of the time she recommends it, no one gets it.  So she just stopped recommending it.  Sometimes the best things are left undiscovered.  Leaves more for me :)   I will be coming back for your Key Lime Gelato.  It was a perfect ending to a rich and filling dinner."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a pizza snob. Maybe I caught them on a bad night.  But, I will not be giving them another shot.  My pizza was burned and they lost my order so it took 15 minutes and 3 people to run a credit card.  

True pizza lovers, there is a good chance you will be disappointed, especially if you're use to quality pizza outside of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Meh.  A passable pizza.  The crust is almost too bread and the topping are scant (3 winter basil leaves on a whole pizza).  And unfortunately there aren't too many options in Shadyside."}
{"text":"VERY PLEASED. Clean and nice environment. Our service was phenomenal. I strongly suggest the house chard and PIZZA. We will be back."}
{"text":"I started coming here because I actually found a groupon and it's slowly becoming one of my favorites. We get the caprese, the bruschetta, and the Bianca pizza. Everything is delicious- the balsamic glaze on the caprese is so good! So fresh! 
We usually end with a little lemon galato to cleanse the palette!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and gelato. It has a fancy date-night kind of vibe, but isn't super expensive. Somehow it also seems family friendly and I see people with their kids here all the time. Somehow they hit both targets at once.

My friend from Italy is a bit of a pizza snob but eats here all the time. I've had almost everything on the menu at some point and it's all great."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for awhile now and I figured it's about them to leave a review. Consistently good pizza. Always served right from the oven so it's hot and delicious. Service is also always good. Our server during our most recent visit was one that we've had before and he's excellent. Warm, friendly, and attentive. Since it was so cold outside, we didn't get gelato, but from past experiences it always wonderful. Recommended!"}
{"text":"The Pizza and gelato are excellent. But if you tell me it's a 20 minute wait, then an hour and a half is unacceptable! Shame on our party for waiting. Not again."}
{"text":"There's no shortage of pizza places in Pittsburgh, but a friend and I decided to check Mercurios out because we saw that it had gelato as well--which would save us a separate trip to get ice cream or dessert.

Was a little disappointed, not gonna lie. It's pricey, and the pizza is pretty light. It tasted good enough, not the best thin-crust pizza I've had though. I don't mind spending a little extra for a great meal but both of us walked out feeling still a little hungry. Not really worth visiting if you're on a college student budget or with a college student appetite."}
{"text":"I recently had the chance to sample the gelato at Mercurio's. Not only did I sample one flavor, I actually sampled a whole bunch. 

The staff was very nice about sampling and I was able to make an educated decision with a small strawberry cheesecake. Had I properly read the sign, I would have noticed that I could put three flavors in a small, but you live and learn. After careful deliberation I selected the strawberry cheesecake and it was totally enjoyable as a solo flavor. It was creamy, refreshing and embodied the gelato version of a strawberry cheesecake. I almost went back for another round of gelato but logic kicked in and I resisted. 

My small was less than $3 which I found to be very reasonable. 

Excellent gelato. Excellent variety. Excellent prices."}
{"text":"Mmmm... Gelato here is awesome. Came in here for my first time and was impressed with everything I saw. A ton of different selections of Gelato, I had the coconut cream pie which was incredibly good. They also have a brick oven pizza and some beers on tap set up although I didn't try it. They sell the Gelato by weight which I think is a great way to sell these types of products in my opinion. The woman behind the counter was very friendly. I can't come back here soon enough matter of fact I'm going here today again."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite dine in pizza restaurant in Pittsburgh.

The pizzas are more \"Italian style\" that feature fresh slices of mozzarella as opposed to the shredded stuff and there is no pepperoni to be found.  I've probably had every pizza there is here and they are all good, but my favorites include the margherita, prosciutto, and quattro formaggi.  The mozzarella is really the star of the show and it is really top notch.  When combined with the rest of the tasty ingredients and excellent preparation, the result is a really good pizza.

The salads are also excellent and the gellato is good, but good luck having enough room left over after your meal to be able to eat any.

Otherwise, the restaurant is attractive and comfortable, and the staff is attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Had the gelato twice. It's been good. Lots of flavors to choose from. I got the pistachio once and tiramisu. The staff is always friendly. One day I'll have to try their pizza. They cook it in a brick oven so I'm betting that it's good too."}
{"text":"The staff here were so friendly. This is a small place with fantastic pizzas. The pizzas are big enough to share with one other person and we shared the Robertos which had gooey burrata cheese on it with grape tomatoes and basil layered underneath. It was so good and the crust was so crispy and amazing. And once you've finished your meal you can pop right up and taste then order some gelato and add it to your tab. This place was great and the panzanella salad was so good too! If you're wanting pizza look no further than Mercurio's they have some of the best pizza and delicious gelato to top it off. I will say though that after tasting the cappuccino gelato shake, it was a lot more milk flavored than cappuccino but other than that no complaints from this party."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! I'm a fanatical pizza lover and generally prefer just plain pepperoni but the menu here is static and this wasn't an option. And yet, I couldn't be happier.

We tried the Oliva, with tomato sauce, black olives, basil, and mozzarella, and let me tell you, it was wonderful! The man I was with has had pizza in Italy and said this wasn't too far off from what he tasted there.The crust was delicate and light while still having a rustic feel and enough body to carry the heaviness of the cheese. The mozzarella was clearly of a high quality, the tomato sauce was gorgeous in both color and flavor, the olives gave it pizazz, and the basil complemented everything else beautifully to make a wonderfully well rounded flavor. It is probably the second best pizza I have ever tasted, the first being Memphis Pizza Cafe in Memphis, TN, and as much pizza as I have tried, thats really something!  

And for that, we paid 10$. It was really remarkable. 

Afterwards, we each got a cup of gelato for the walk home, and this was splendid as well! There were sooo many flavors, it was very difficult to choose! Many had things mixed in like chocolate pieces or cherries or pie crust. The flavors were very diverse. The toasted coconut was a perfect balance of toasty coconut and soft creamy chocolate. The caramel latte was the best coffee flavored ice cream I have ever had. I don't generally like coffee, but this was perfectly subtle in its coffee flavor with a punch of caramel after it sits on your tongue for a moment. It was really a fantastic treat and we paid less for this than we would have at a Cold Stone or Marble Slab.

All in all, if you do not like pizza, this may not be the place for you, but if you're fond of Italian, do not miss this place!! I will only be in town for another three days and I am already planning to go back for one more round before I leave. Worth every penny of the less than 20$ tab and a fabulous experience!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this establishment when it was in Kittanning, but haven't been here since they moved. Sure wish they would reopen. The gelato and biscotti were delicious."}
{"text":"The pizzas are very thin & light. But the best part about Mercurio's is definitely their gelato. I would 1000% recommend the coconut-cream-pie flavor! IT IS AMAZING! It has mini coconut flake pieces in it and is hands down the best gelato I've ever had."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Mercurio's in a while (for reasons I'll get into in a moment), but they are one of the most consistent pizza shops in Pittsburgh. Most of the time we stop here these days is for their gelato which is always delicious - personal favorite is the key lime when it's available.

This would normally be a five star review, but the reason we haven't eaten here in some time is that during my last two visits we had to deal with fruit flies. Enough of them that I lost my temper a bit and vowed to not come back. During my most recent visit, wouldn't you know it we had another one... but just one this time so it wasn't as big a deal.

There clearly is an issue that must come and go here, I'm not sure the root cause but hopefully they get it 100% sorted out because their pizza and salads are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh! We ordered four pizzas and I love everything! Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! It's so fresh. You don't feel bad at all eating the whole pizza! :) the cheese is amazingly delicious. The sauce is not salty and In fact you can taste the fresh tomato perfectly. Another great thing is that everyone is so so nice and you feel so welcome there:) a MUST go ! Pizza and gelato: fantastico!!"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment! Although I used to go to This pizzeria pretty often when they opened, I am no longer impressed. They are cheaters. After a couple of years of quality pizza their products decreased in quality. There is barely any cheese on the pizza and they burn the crust. That is no longer Italian quality oven baked pizza. It is an altered product meant to make money. Soon people will realize that the hype is all gone and all they get is an imitation of what it used to be. The waiting time is crazy as well. 4o minutes to cook a piece of dough?"}
{"text":"The best pizza in the city! Authentic Italian food and gelato! Pro-tip: if you want gelato after eating pizza, you can get it and have it added to your check! Super delicious and cute."}
{"text":"We love the Ramana pizza, fresh from the oven! The service was also great. We had friends joining us and changed the table from 2 to 4. It was all taken good care by our server!"}
{"text":"The key lime pie gelato was delicious - boyfriend always knows what I'll like :) Death by chocolate was rich, satisfying, and definitely not what I expected from gelato. Yummmm :)"}
{"text":"I can't believe I hadn't tried Mercurio's until today! I love wood-fired pizza so much, and this is some of the best in Pittsburgh. The menu is perfectly sized, with plenty of options but not at all overwhelming. Simple, straightforward food--antipasti, salads, pizza, some pasta. I'd like to return for dinner too because their wine list looks great, and you can get many wines by the half carafe. We ordered the rustico salad with prosciutto, artichokes, olives and cherry tomatoes, which was light and simple. It was served with delicious grilled bread and just the right amount of balsamic. We then shared the Pizza Del Re. If you're a fan of truffles, this is divine! It has baby bellas, mozzarella, prosciutto and truffle spread. The crust was soft yet thin, and was cooked perfectly.

Of course we had to try the gelato as well, which was good but hard to live up to the deliciousness of the pizza. We will certainly be returning soon!"}
{"text":"We finally are here after getting just gelato a few times. We use the NoWait app and after a few minutes it said we were no longer in line... WTF. We never received a text about our table being ready either. Weird. We ordered the prosciutto pizza, and the italiano panini and split both between the two of us. The pizza was burnt, and soggy. And I'm not talking browned, but charred. The prosciutto was placed on top of the sliced pizza, so we had to cut it ourselves which was a pain since we only had dull knives. The panini was okay, but nothing to write home about. Luckily, we had a 50% off one pizza coupon through Loyal Tree. We finished the night off with gelato which is really the redeeming quality of this place. Come for the gelato, for sure! Skip the pizza."}
{"text":"I've never eaten food here so this is strictly about the gelato. 

On that front this place is fantastic and worth of go-to spot status. However, one gripe. For the life of me I do not understand why they do not keep either the almond joy or the German chocolate flavors on tap! The almond joy is easily the best they have,IMHO. I mean, I'm not a big coconut guy, just a chocolate guy, and it's certainly the best chocolate related item I've had there. The German chocolate is similarly constituted and thus a close second. But for whatever reason they treat these items like Step-flavors. I even call ahead sometimes only to be disappointed over the phone. I wish they'd address this issue. Otherwise a fantastic place, sans chocolate-coconut combos."}
{"text":"I went to Mercurio's because I got an Amazon Local deal and I must say they impressed me and I most certainly will be going back! The pizza was amazing! Each pizza is a good amount for one person. When we were done, we were full and satisfied but not stuffed (and still had room for a little gelato). The pizza crust was perfect, thin, light, but had the perfect bite. All the ingredients are SO fresh, you can taste each ingredient but they all mesh together perfectly. They definitely earned a new regular!"}
{"text":"They are back!!!!! But seriously, I still don't get the big deal .. Gelato vs regular ice cream, eh!  But it was tasty. But it's not a coldstones!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was ordering takeout and it was cancelled with no explanation. We called and asked why and was told it was because they were unable to add arugala to my margherita pizza. We even offered to pay extra for a small handful of arugala but was told no, there are \"no substitutions.\" Isn't that an addition? That we offered to pay for? 

We ended up not ordering anything at all. I can't understand the mentality of losing a $50+ order for a simple handful of arugala."}
{"text":"Very cute place with tons of flavors - everything looks yummy and it's almost impossible to make a decision.  The mint chocolate chunk was yummy.  The raspberry truffle was not as good - not much raspberry flavor and the truffles didn't have that distinct truffley texture.  Also, a medium is pretty big - even for me, a big girl with a big appetite and a major sweet tooth.  It may be because the density is higher than ice cream.  If you stick to a small, it's affordable.  (There is a $5 credit card minimum.)  It will be crowded on weekend nights because of the traffic for Girasole, but during the day on a Sunday it was practically empty.  There's a nice bench across the street to enjoy your treats and people-watch.

I will definitely keep returning to try as many flavors as my food allergies will allow."}
{"text":"I usually end up getting Mercurio's every other week. A lot of the time I get a takeout Maragrita pizza which is generally good but can be inconsistent based on who is making it. The Neapolitan style of pizza they serve has a unique taste that you usually can't get in Pittsburgh. This restaurant is on the loyalty tree app which means you collect points for each purchase that add up to free items. The staff is always very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend any pizza lover give it a try."}
{"text":"I love their gelato. It's some of the best I've ever had. They have unusual flavors combinations.  It's great anytime (is there ever not a good time for gelato?). Their pizza however, is not for me. I should've looked at the pics before ordering. The toppings are mostly centered in the middle of the pie, where you get a few really good bites and that's it. I tried the margherita, which is so highly touted, and the mushroom, which were just button mushrooms. They did not have flavor. The mozzarella had no flavor! It was bland, and needed salt, and it was placed so sparingly and thinly on the dough. There's so much dough to get through, as compared to the actual toppings of the pizzas. I get that neopolitan style pizzas traditionally aren't loaded to the gills, but still, this was hard to appreciate. I ordered the one to go, and I'm not far from here so was able to eat it while still hot. The dough was tough and chewy, too much for my taste, which means it was overworked. I recommend ordering in advance for pickup. I know they're popular for their pizzas, and I always see tables full of people enjoying them. But I'll just stick to their gelatos."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  We tried a bunch of different pizza's and all were great!  We also had to get some gelato at the end...which was just as yummy as expected.  The prices are reasonable.  It's a small intimate setting and I can see how there could be a long wait for a table.  The tables are very close together as well, so it seems slightly cramped.  The woodfire pizzas are some of the best I've ever had and the gelato/dessert selection is great!  There are so many dessert options that it's tough to make a decision!!  I definitely can't wait to go back and try it again!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza and gelato in Pittsburgh!

I never knew about this place before our Yelp Elite Event. All the food was so good during the event that I've gone back quite a few times since. 

They offer amazing Neapolitan style pizza, salads and gelato. Our favorite pizzas are the Pizza Del Re (House made mozzarella, truffle spread, mushrooms, Prosciutto di Parma, extra virgin olive oil) and the Quattro Formaggi (Mozzarella di bufala, fontina, parmigiano, provolone, extra virgin olive oil)

The space is small so a lot of times there will be a wait, especially on the weekends so use the No Wait App. Also be sure to download the free Loyal Tree App for your smart phone to get a free gelato when you join the Mercurio's loyalty program. You'll even earn points with each visit and be rewarded with cash back to spend at Mercurio's.

The gelato is just as good as the pizza. My favorites are The Vanilla Custard, Dulce De Leche and Strawberry Cheesecake. Thank God for my waistline that this place didn't exist when I lived in Shadyside! 

Service is always great as well."}
{"text":"After living around here on and off for the last 5 years, I finally got around to stopping in here for dinner the other night off of a Groupon. And I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the service and quality of food (and gelato!!). The servers and staff were all very nice, especially when I walked in on an empty night a half hour before closing time. They were more than happy to start up a pizza and hand out a bunch of samples of the gelato. Damn is it good! There was a nice variety of flavors, and I ended up getting something I had never tried until that night (salted caramel truffle). I split a lasagna pizza (lasagna pizza, what?!) with the boy, and they were nice enough to make the other side meat-free for me. And it was great.  Overall, I really enjoyed my meal here and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Why oh why can't you stay open through the winter? I want ice cream..."}
{"text":"I came for the ice cream and let me tell you something, this is an authentic Gelateria. I tried the Nutella and hazelnut cone! Really good"}
{"text":"I've been a few times and each time has been a great experience. The dine in food is fantastic as well as any of the gelato you get. 

Parking isn't too bad - you can park on the street if you're lucky or in the garage across the street. 

The only issue I've had was when I ordered a large pizza and asked for the mushrooms to be removed which apparently didn't get across, because I received a pizza full of mushrooms that they made me pick off"}
{"text":"Ordered online here and it said 25 minutes. Took closer to 35, but pizza and gelato are top notch."}
{"text":"This place is a good place to get gelato, I just think its overpriced.  

But if a serving of creamy sweet cold melt-in-your mouth goodness is what your looking for this is the perfect place.  

Everything is sold by the lb, so the price of your gelato will always vary.  As with many ice cream/gelato dessert places you can try the different flavors to see what you'll like, so taste them and pick the flavor that you will love!  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Neapolitan pizza and gelato. How can it get any better than this? Mercurios has one of the most affordable Neapolitan pizza menus in Pittsburgh and the pizza is pretty dead on. Aside from Stone downtown, this is my favorite Neapolitan pizza in this city. I also love that they have gelato because it's pretty hard finding gelato in Pittsburgh. To combine the two is a brilliant idea. When my husband and I came here, we ordered the caprese panini, margherita pizza and two gelatos. I don't remember what flavor gelato he got, but I ordered the dulce de leche. The panini and pie had fresh ingredients that were well balanced and not overpowering of any one ingredient and the gelato was rich, creamy and delicious as you would expect from gelato. The nice thing is you can come in here just for the gelato or just for the pizza or have both!"}
{"text":"I went to Mercurio's yesterday with my sister ,and had the sausage pizza with extra sauce.  It was very tasty!!!  I love their sauce...I could eat s bowl full.  The pizza wasn't as hot as wanted, but it was worm enough to eat. We did have to ask them to reheat it.  After pizza, I had strawberry cheesecake and blackberry gelato.  Their gelato is the best hands down!! 
In other news, the restaurant is a nice place for a quick eat, dinner with friends, and/or late night snack!  Due to small space, I would recommend going with a group larger than 4.  It's kind of a tight squeeze!  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Groupon.  Started with the bruschetta, and the bread was soggy and the tomato toppings were ice cold.  Next up was the pizza.  There were burnt areas of the crust, which is ok on a brick oven pie, but the dough was not cooked thoroughly and was disgusting.  There are many other places that offer good pizza in the area without wasting time and money here."}
{"text":"When I think good pizza, I think Mercurio's. Seriously, their wood-fired pizza is the best I've ever eaten. I came here often when I lived in Shadyside during college. But now that I live in the South Hills I still make special trips to eat here. In fact, my parents, who are from out of tow, often request to go here when they are visiting.

Whether you go for the classic Margherita or for something more involved like the Capricciosa, you will not be disappointed. I love mushrooms, so my favorite is the funghi, but I try to get something new every time I go. If you're not feeling pizza, they also have delicious paninis. I recommend the caprese or italino.

Many people just go here for the gelato. And it's not wonder why. It's soooo much better than your typical ice cream. They have so many flavors to choose from that picking one is often overwhelming. I try to get something new every time I go. 

While Mercurio's may look more like a counter-top service place, it double as a really nice sit-down restaurant. They even offer wine and beer on their menu. Be warned though, there aren't tons of tables, so you'll want to be prepared to wait. Luckily, they do have NoWait, so if the wait is long you can visit surrounding Walnut St. shops while you wait for them to text you your table is ready. 

Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"YUMMMM this place is delish. And, the pizza takes no time at all to make. The gelato is great too and if you have the loyaltree app you can get free stuff. We had a plain pizza (boring but good) and a Med.?? (can't remember but there were artichokes). Both were great and there is WAYYY too much for one person, you can def. share these.

I really want to try a gelato milkshake! Looks delish."}
{"text":"We eat here one to two times per month.  I ALWAYS order the Panzanella salad to start and the Del Re pizza.  The wife and kids go with the simple, yet traditional, Margherita pizza. We absolutely love the food, atmosphere, and service we receive from the personable workers.  Everything tastes extremely fresh and the gelato tastes like it is straight from Italy.  You have to try his place if you've not already done so.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! The lasagna pizza is my favorite with yummy sausage. I have It every time I'm there along with the panzanella salad. I'm almost embarrassed to say I can eat everything plus gelato and a delicious cappuccino. All just like I was in Italy."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I don't know my gelato, but I thought this place was just A-OK. There was nothing memorable or special about the gelato or the creamery shop."}
{"text":"Pizza and Gelato is always a great combination of course but mercurio's is better than awesome. I tried the Bianca pizza. The crust, cheese, tomatoes were so tasty. I ended my visit with a combo of the salted caramel, cookies and creme and pistachio gelato. Loved every taste. Will be back with more friends"}
{"text":"fruity, decadent, and bursting with flavor, oh my!

mercurio's, modestly tucked away in a little nook, is pretty sweet (no pun intended..okay maybe).

upon entrance, you are greeted with colors that razzle, dazzle, and entice you, along with a friendly staff. the gelato all looks so good that you can't help but ask to sample a few. and sample a few i did.

i flirted with the cinnamon bun for a while, and it was incredible, but also incredibly rich. the mango was good, but they went the sweeter route when i was more interested in a tangy one. the pistachio was creamy and not too sweet--just the way it should be.

after all was said and done, i decided i wanted a medium cup that consisted of one fruity and one rich gelato. cue pink guava and gianduia (a sweet chocolate that contains about 30% hazelnut paste..think a light and fluffy nutella). it didn't matter what flavor you picked..the gelato was the same consistency as the gelato i had in piazza navona. pink and brown is a good combination on its own, but the flavors worked surprisingly well together. the heavier gianduia was balanced by the pink guava, which made me nostalgic as it reminded me of the philippine pomelo. sinful yet refreshing.

at 62 cents an ounce, my medium cup (which is 5-8 ounces generally) came to about $3.50. i took a star off because i happened to get the coagulated, thick top part of the gelato that has a texture similar to a cheap sugary bubblegum that you can't fully enjoy. in the scheme of things, that top part is so tiny compared with the rest of the gelato you get, and if i'm ever back in the 'burgh, i'll be hitting up mercurio's for a new creative pairing."}
{"text":"This place was one of the Pittsburgh Restaurant Week choices, and I was not disappointed in the least bit. We received great service, and everyone working there was super friendly. The atmosphere is authentic, and the brick oven from Naples makes it even cooler. 

For Restaurant Week, the offer was a salad, pizza, and gelato for $14.01. Very tasty. The serving of salad was huge and a lot more than we expected. It was fresh, too. The pizza was great, too, and a large serving. Even though it didn't have as much cheese as I would have hoped, it was definitely cooked perfectly in the brick oven. The gelato choices are awesome, and being dessert, it was obviously the best part. I only wish the scoop of gelato would've been a little bigger.

I would recommend this place, especially because of the prices and service. Walnut Street needed a nice addition like this, and it really fits in perfectly for the area that it's in."}
{"text":"Another perfect meal at Mercurio's last night. We love taking sporadic trips to this place for dinner. The restaurant is small, with limited seating both inside and outside. 

For drinks, my husband and I got the house red wine...$18 for a carafe (~6 glasses). This wine isn't overly complicated, but it's a nice light red which is a nice accompaniment to the meal.

We started with the house salad...a sizeable salad with mixed greens, grape tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, parm, and a homemade vinegarette dressing. The salad is served with 2 crostini, which are toasted with olive oil and a rub of garlic. I'd dare say this salad is the best starter salad I've ever had (and I get it every time we visit this restaurant). 

I order the margherita pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Simple, yet delicious. They make their pizzas in a wood fire grill, making a nice char on the thin crust pizza. Pizzas are individually sized and can be eaten all at once or make for a delicious leftover snack later.

Finished with a small mint chocolate chunk gelato...what a perfect finish to a perfect meal!

Until next time!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mercurio's a couple of times. A decent place for some gourmet pizza and dessert when in Shadyside. The carne e fromaggio appetizer is good; the bread that comes with the meats, cheeses, and arugula plate is nicely toasted without being so crisp that it falls apart. Their pizzas are hit or miss, and light on the toppings in my opinion, but still make for an enjoyable meal. 

Off of the pizza menu, I've had the Prosciutto and Pizza Roberto. The Pizza Roberto, in my opinion, is not worth the try (or price)... the home made burrata cheese makes the pizza watery and soggy. Do yourself a favor - save $7 and get the Margherita pizza instead. Luckily I used an online voucher deal during the meal that I ordered the Pizza Roberto, so the disappointment wasn't too damaging."}
{"text":"Best Gelato in pittsburgh. HUGE selection. The place is small and usually the line is out the door. Be prepared !!"}
{"text":"I went here starving with my boyfriend and we each ordered our own pizza. I have no shame in saying that I ate it all and then some. Even got some gelato. It was all AMAZING! I'll be there at least once a week! That was a joke, I think.

People say perfection isn't possible... those people have not eaten at Mercurio's."}
{"text":"This place is really special from the hardworking friendly staff to the gelato. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"So many wonderful choices, and hearty portions for the price. I love their unusual flavors, like honey-sunflower, as well as their stalwart selections like pistachio and raspberry truffle. If you want a solo small, be prepared to pay cash."}
{"text":"My fiancé is awesome and he didn't like his food so this place deserves a 3! Haha jk!

But the truth is we went there and had high hopes with the good reviews. I ordered a salame caprese pizza that I thoroughly enjoyed. The pizza was decently sized, but it was also extremely thing so it wasn't going to stuff anyone's face. The flavors were there and it was fresh out of the oven. Per my fiancé, he still likes Piccolo Forno pizza better. As for him, he got a eggplant Parma that was more on the bland side. Also we prefer eggplants that are softer/cooked more. If you like chewy eggplant then give this one a try.

We also got a banana milkshake that was good but it wasn't anything different than other milkshakes. We did not try their gelato, so this review is purely on their food.

But yes I would definitely go back again to try their gelatos (and food too)! Maybe it would be different next time!"}
{"text":"Went to this place over the weekend, when you first walk in it's kinda confusing. You have to walk to the back to get pizza. I had gotten just a plain margarita pie, which is just enough for you. The pizza is very good the only down side is that it's not crispy. And it does take a while, about 15 minutes per pie you order. But overall it was very good, order from there twice. Will go back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. They have fantastic pizza: I'm huge fan of their della casa, although basically everything I've tried here in terms of pizza has been great. Their gelato is also really great and they have a really nice selection. Slightly pricier than other walnut street restaurants, but you get what you pay for. Service is so-so -- servers often seem slightly overworked, as if there's one too few of them."}
{"text":"The best pizza here. I have been here many time. Start with pizza and end with gelato. My waitress was so kind. Love to go back. ^^"}
{"text":"love the selection of gelato flavors. next time I go I definitely want to try their food! seating is a little tight but the gelato is just so good!!"}
{"text":"Fast, tasty pies with good sauce and doughy-chewy crusts.  Was nice to end with gelato."}
{"text":"We stopped by here on a whim to get a quick \"slice\" of pizza. However, all their pizzas are created as a personal style which are 4 generous slices with thin crust. We ordered one margarita pizza, ate 2 slices and were completely satisfied for $10! I have had their gelato in the past which was the one time I came here before, and it's heaven. It's one of those places you have to stop by when you're in the area. The service is fast and they're friendly."}
{"text":"Their pizzas are good. I do however wish that they would add more cheese to them. The service was also good even when it was the day after Thanksgiving and they were pretty packed for lunch. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"My first time there.  There were a variety of flavors.  I tasted the butter pecan and Dulce De Leche.  They were phenomenal.  So I got a small on a sugar cone. It was perfect temperature to eat outside.  There is a dine in option.  They also serve beer.  I saw someone ordering Stella Artois in gorgeous gauntlets. I will definitely be back to try new flavors!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mercurio's a few times, the food is good, not great. The pizzas are typically a smidge too blackened on the bottom, just enough to overpower the taste of the dish, but you can't go wrong with a salad. 

The service is hit or miss. I've had exceptional waiters, but I've also had waiters that walk past enough times that your hair turns gray. 

On a high note, ready for a pizza hack? Order the marinara pizza and a house salad, sans cheese. Take some salad, top pizza accordingly. It's fast, fresh, and only runs around $13 between the two."}
{"text":"Came here twice, both times with Groupons. 

Everything was mediocre (tried 2 types of pizza, a calzone, a salad) except the Italian sandwich, which I found to be tasty and reasonably priced. My main gripe about the other food was that it was soggy...the pizza bottoms, the calzone...mushy dough is not yummy.

I likely will not be back except maybe to try the gelato."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! We're from Texas and I'll admit I was shocked to be serve Italian food from an Italian waiter! lol I think that just elevated the whole experience. We went there on the back end of an art festival and had great service, delicious salad and pizza  (we ordered one of each and split it) and house wine. We sat right next to the \"kitchen\" and had little puffs of flour come out way. It was lovely experience. My only gripe would be the restroom, could do with a little upgrade, but the job gets done I suppose :P"}
{"text":"I've been to Mercurio's a few times, but Saturday I took my parents along for their first time.  We ordered two pizza's between the three of us and my mom and I got gelato for dessert.  We ordered a Quattro Formaggi and  Margherita pies.

The only reason I give them four stars is because I'm not in love with the pizza but I am in love with the gelato.  Staff is generally friendly, super young but nice and professional.  They seem to enjoy working there.  Again, gelato is amazing.  This is my go-to for dessert.

I think there is better pizza in the city, Mercurio's pizzas are a little pricey (in my opinion) and I think you could get a better specialty pizza somewhere else in the city for the same price."}
{"text":"Come when the weather is nice so that you can sit outside, drink a glass of wine, and enjoy some delicious pizza. The Funghi is a must!

Make sure to sample some gelato after you eat. There are tons of flavors to choose from, chocolatey as well as fruity."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night, the restaurant was really crowded. My capstone project teammate told me it sells really nice gelato. Ordered Margarita pizza, pretty the same as I had tried in Napoli before. Also the Gelato is delicious. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Loved this place the one time I went. Best pie in Pittsburgh. Love the whole stone oven cooking method. Better than that fast food garbage. For a fun yet classy first date this is a great small and fun place to get some good food and you can finish it off with the gelato. Yum."}
{"text":"Tasty brick oven pizza awaits you in Shadyside.  Mercurio's is a great place to eat some pizza and gelato.  Very good Neapolitan pizzas to choose from, including some exceptional veggie options.  Don't come here expecting greasy NY style, cholestorol-laden deep-dish, or incredibly saucy Little-Ceasers-esque pizza.

Service is solid, and the price is reasonable.  Quantity of food is plenty.  The gelato selection is relatively robust, and is quite flavorful.  All-in-all, a very strong establishment which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Being a frequent visitor of Walnut street I have visited Mercurios several times as well.  I first visited the venue when it was still serving only gellato.  They have a large variety of flavors and you can also taste them before making your choice! They will also make a milkshake with the gelato if you want to.  A great place to get an ice-cream! 

During the last years they have also created a nice restaurant.  Their wood oven made pizza is delicious.  Only catch is that the seating is limited so there can be a bit of a wait on busy nights."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mercurio's for several years now, but their new location on Walnut is definitely an improvement on the old. They still have the same excellent gelato flavors and waffle cones, but now offer a full array of lunch and dinner options in addition to wine and beer. All the food I've had here has been excellent, but I especially like their wood-fired pizzas and salads. This is now near the top of my list for Italian food in the area, and makes a wonderful spot for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, cozy atmosphere, and friendly, prompt service.

Went on a Sunday around 7pm with a party of 2, was seated immediately (though the restaurant was pretty full). If you sit near the back, you can see them preparing the pizza! Tables are a little close together, so probably not the best for business or more private conversations. Great people/dog-watching out the window.

2 beers, 2 pizzas, and 2 gelatos with tip was around $50. Not cheap, but very good!

We got the Margherita and Diavola pizzas, which were both excellent. Light yet filling & satisfying. I think you can ask for olive oil if you'd like to dip your crust. The table next to us had bruschetta, which looked great. We also had Death By Chocolate and Tiramisu gelato -- sooo good!

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good brick oven pizza. The personal size is perfect. It is satisfying and you still have room for the delicious gelato afterwards, which is a must get. I usually get the Margherita pizza and it is very good every time. they have the brick oven right there so you can watch them cook it.

All in all, my boyfriend and I like it and came to the conclusion that it is a good place when you are looking for restaurant pizza, but not just a pizza joint. A little bit less casual than a pizza joint. 

Still good food though and I recommend it to people often."}
{"text":"Gelato quite good, but capogiro in Philly wins for me."}
{"text":"Although I can't say much about Mercurio's as I've only been there once for dessert, the coconut gelato was great, the coffee was good, and the service was prompt and friendly. My only complaint was that it was rather hot inside- perhaps the ac was broken."}
{"text":"Love this little gem in Shadyside! Pizzas are fantastic and obviously the gelato...so good! I have had several flavors and loved them all. Also had the Lasagne Pizza one night for dinner. Homemade tomato sauce, perfect bubbly and semi thick chewy crust with ricotta and sausage. Really good! I would love to try their Margherita pizza which my friend got and also looked fantastic. In the summer time the line is long for gelato on warm nights but worth the wait! Staff is also very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I first experienced Mercurio's at various yelp events and was always impressed by their gelato. Now that I work in Shadyside, I knew I had to stop by! I have been here about 3 times in the past month- yes I am a little obsessed.

Let's start with dessert first... the gelato.. is amazing! It's some of the best I have ever had. After trying it the first time, I was head over heels in love. My parents and I were in Lawrenceville, craving ice cream on Mother's Day, and the one place that popped in my head was this place. We came and they LOVED it. I think the blueberry muffin is my favorite... it's incredible. I also really enjoyed the strawberry cheesecake. My parents couldn't stop raving about their choices as well.  My dad was impressed with the brick oven and went over to talk to the employees about it. They were super friendly to my dad and very welcoming. They recommended that he try the sausage pizza with extra sausage and extra cheese and my dad could not resist. Which leads me to...

...the food. Yummmm. The pizza that was recommended to my dad was incredible and he loved it. He could not stop raving about it and said that the leftovers were even better the next day. We recently just visited again and this time, I ordered my own pizza. I kept it simple, ordering the Bianca (white pizza with tomatoes and basil). It was awesome- light, with a perfect fluffy crust. The flavors were fresh and just delicious. My mom ordered the ensalata con portabella- wow... the portabellas were prepared perfectly! The dressing was light and full of flavor. My dad ordered the italiano panini, which was epic. Perfect amount of meat, bread, cheese and sauce... I was surprised with how much I loved it.

This place is the whole package. Located right on Walnut Street, it's the perfect place for a date night or casual lunch. Service was great all three times I have visited as well. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Want a pizza from the old country with having to cross the Atlantic? This restaurant can help you! I guarantee they have the perfect pizza for you. The majority of the people seem to come for their gelato, but to be honest I have never got that close to desert here. I don't know whether it's the brick oven or the fact that they make most of the basic ingredients in house, but it's working for them...
 If you are in the area, you want authentic pizza and you go somewhere else, you're a di*k.
That's is all."}
{"text":"My 2nd trip to Mecurios for their Neopolitan Pizza.  Yum. Love the imported ove that bakes up the perfect crust.  I am partial to whiite pizzas these days.  The Del Re was really delicious with the right balance of mushroom and prosciutto.  I was looking for the truffle to come through a bit more.  But tasty regardless!"}
{"text":"I have adored Mercurios, their family story of learning the trait of gelato and the success over years growing from their former shadyside location over Girasole restaurant to the corner of Walnut and Filbert street. They recently [within the new location] have expanded into woodfired Pizzas, something I am in sore need to trying, but right now we will talk about Gelato.

Gelato, the real stuff not the crappy Rita's version, when done right, is a form of art. Not only must you source your ingredients with great care and combine flavors for unique tastes, you must cream it just right, giving it a density and hardness that will slow the melting process but also soft enough to easily scoop into your cup or homemade waffle cone. If you ever make it to the annual SIGEP Rimini Gelato and Confetionary Convention or watch it's documentary you will understand the art that goes into this wonderful desert. And Mercurio's does it well. 

Not only do they offer a daily assortment of around 30 gelatos and ices at once, they rotate frequently from standard staple chocolate, the better Death-by-Chocolate to American favorite creations such as Strawberry Cheesecake or Turtle. The baristas [I guess that is what I would call them] are friendly and efficient and will gladly serve you little spoonfull in case you cannot make up your mind.

Next, they make milkshakes. OMG too amazing, they are liquid crack. but incredibly filling, so beware and save for a very hot day. 

Additionally, I love that the gelato is offered by weight, something that bothers me about other places in the city where you can get a spoon full or gallon serving depending on who sits behind the bar at that point in time, making the whole experience very affordable when you just want a little bite or treat on a hot Summer Day.

I cannot wait to come and try out their Pizza one day so I can judge this establishment in it's entirety."}
{"text":"Gelato review only - although I must return soon for the pizza.  From the other reviews and the look of it, I can't wait to taste it. 

We came in at like 7 on a Friday night.  It was packed, but they had left 2 tables in the front for gelato eaters, which I thought was really nice.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that paying by the ounce is weird when you aren't filling up the cup yourself, but after tasting it, I could care less how much I pay for it. 

J got the birthday cake which had huge chunks - huge! - of birthday cake.  I got the caramel chocolate latte.  Wow.  It was ridiculously creamy and flavorful.  

I also really like that the cups are biodegradable - always nice to give back to the earth. 

If you haven't been for the gelato, you must go.  Tons of flavors, something for everyone!"}
{"text":"The ice cream was all right but the two pizzas we got were both spectacularly disappointing."}
{"text":"I tried Mercurio's gelato two years ago and, more recently, at the Yelp Burgh Bash this past Sept., and I finally had the chance to stop by for dinner last Sat.  Based on my experience with the gelato and what I'd heard from Yelp and elsewhere, I was eager to try Mercurio's savory offerings.

My dining partner and I shared a house salad (insalata de la casa), as well as a prosciutto pizza.  (Thanks for the great recommendation, fellow Yelpers!)  The house salad consisted of spring greens, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and parmesan dressed with balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and included two pieces of toasted Italian bread.  I found the salad to be quite fresh and flavorful, and large enough for two people to share comfortably.  In terms of flavor, I found the pizza to be quite solid, with the prosciutto being the standout, with just the right amount of smokiness and saltiness.  It also hid a few key shortcomings, such as a sparser-than-preferable amount of cheese, quite effectively.  If you've read my reviews of other pizza places around PGH, you'll know that the aspect of pizza that I tend to be persnickety about is the crispness of the crust. While the crust was light and airy, which was great, it unfortunately lacked the key crispness on the bottom that's essential to a perfect pizza, in my view.  Nevertheless, I was generally pretty satisfied with the quality of the pizza, esp. compared to other wood-fired pizza places around town.

Needless to say, after finishing the savory portion of our meal, my dining partner and I had to order the gelato, since that's what Mercurio's is best known for.  I had a small, which I split between mint chocolate chunk (my favorite!) and triple chocolate, and my dining partner had a medium, split between chocolate and caramel.  The gelato was just as delectable as I remembered, with satisfying creaminess and flavors.

While the ambiance was a bit minimalist, I didn't mind. My one complaint about the layout was that the dining area was quite small and could feel a bit cramped at times.  (At one point, we had to move our table over a bit so that our neighbors could squeeze through.)  I found the service to be a slower than I'd like, but this was probably due to there being only one waitress responsible for serving all of the dining tables.  Even one more waiter probably would have sped things up and reduced the stress on her significantly.  Overall, despite a couple of shortcomings, I had a pleasant experience dining at Mercurio's, and would definitely return."}
{"text":"I ate here after the Arts Festival.
They make hand made artisan pizza with fresh ingredients.
I tried a new veggie pizza with artichokes, red peppers, muschrooms etc.
It was made well but was plain. The sauce is plain and needs more flavor and italian spices."}
{"text":"The ice creams/gelatos here are excellent.  I have tried the pistachio, cheesecake, and mint flavors and they are all great.  Their ice creams/gelatos are creamy and rich (not watered down), but I never feel guilty after enjoying my snacks here.  I especially love their milkshakes!"}
{"text":"The best pizza and gelato I have had in PA or OH.  Small place but pizzas are so good I can't even put it into words.  Gelato is awesome and many flavors to choose from.  We try to go here every time we are in Pittsburgh :0)"}
{"text":"The gelato is delicious! Creamy and smooth, and sweet but not sugar overkill. I had the chocolate chip and my husband the cookies and cream. The chocolate chip was great, but I think I liked the cookies and cream even more. The cookie chunks were huge (big plus for me) and the ice cream base had a cookie flavor. So good. I did not try the pizza so can only comment on the gelato. Perfect for a hot summer day!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this restaurant and they left me full and satisfied. 

I ordered the Margarita pizza and a half liter of their house red which I split with a friend . The pizza is wood fired and delicious. The sauce is so fresh and the cheese is melty and wonderful. 

I finished with some stracciatella and amaretto gelato. I'm allergic to this stuff (dairy allergy) but it's so good that I have to have some. The amerato is heavenly. 

This place is great for a traditional tummy filling pizza. I would consider it a good date night or girls place."}
{"text":"I'm actually really surprised that I hadn't already written a review for Mercurio's. I've been to this place more times than I can count! They have an amazing pizza menu and I have yet to order a pizza I didn't like. One of the owners has been certified by the Italian government to make pizza, so its definitely legit! The dough is perfect and I'm usually not a crust kind of girl and I gobble the whole pizza up! My favorite is the Pizze del Rey and Salsiccia...oh and you can't go wrong with the Ricotta or Quattro Formaggi! Let's be real. I love 'em all. 

Another notable menu item is their house salad. Its simplest yet most delicious salad my taste buds have ever had the opportunity to dine on. The dressing is light and flavorful and salty. There are chunks of fresh mozzarella and cut grape tomatoes and its served with a to-die-for grilled bread on the side. 

You were probably thinking this place couldn't possibly get any better, and in most situations you'd be right, but THERE'S MORE. Decadent, creamy, delicious gelato is also a must-order at Mercurio's. The owners' mother makes all of the gelato and the flavors are out of this world. My favorite is the blueberry muffin. Its full of blueberries and crumbled cakey goodness. 

The best part of Mercurio's is if you really want to, you can walk out of there spending less than $50 for a couple without a problem and you don't have to sacrifice quality of food or fullness to do it!"}
{"text":"Went here for gelato.. Lots of flavors and the portions for one scoop is good. The pizza also looked delicious and I'll have to go back to try this. Would recommend."}
{"text":"They have a TON a flavors to choose from! And what made this place stand out wasn't just that, it was the amazingly reasonable price for gelato.  They offer you three different sizes, but they charge you based on how many ounces they put in your cup, currently 62 cents per ounce.  I'm glad that there's a decent gelato place near me, and I will probably be coming by again."}
{"text":"Without a doubt this place got the best pizza in Pittsburgh! It's yummylicious won't be hard on your wallet either and if your heart desires for more after their amazing pizza's just move over to their gelato section and you're life will find its meaning that it has been missing!"}
{"text":"Overall, I thought Mercurio's was pretty tasty. Not mind-blowing, like some of the other reviews had me believe, but I was impressed. I think the 42 flavors is what really appeals to some people."}
{"text":"Best brick oven pizza in Pittsburgh. I have eaten @ Mercurios many times and everything I've gotten has been so delicious. Every time my husband & I split the house salad, pesto pistachio pizza & one of their pizzas. The house salad is perfect, it has fresh house made mozzarella, shaved Parmesan & just the right amount of dressing. I absolutely love the pesto pistachio pizza. It's so original, I've never had anything like it anywhere else. I've tried about 4 or 5 different pizzas & they are all very good! My favorite one is the Olive. 
Also love their gelato. There's about 30 different flavors to choose from. My only complaint is the staff puts away the gelato before closing time. So if you eat there close to closing time don't plan on being able to get any gelato after your meal because it'll be all packed up & put away. Nothing should be put away until all customers are done eating or gone. I think that's only courteous.  
I highly recommend eating @ Mercurios you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm normally not a huge fan of pizza in Pittsburgh, but Mercurio's is soooooooooooo good! I ordered the Pizza Del Re and the Marinara and they were both amazing. The prosciutto on the Del Re was salty but sooooooooooooo delicious when eaten with the mushrooms. Even the marinara, despite being such a simple pizza with few ingredients was sooooooooooooo good! The pizzas come in relatively big slices, so I usually take it and fold it in half to eat it. 

I also tried the Chocolate Coffee Bean gelato, which was a great ender to the meal; the coffee flavor came out a lot more than the chocolate, but I didn't have a problem with that. I will say that a lot of their gelato flavors seem relatively similar to each other (e.g. chocolate+coffee+nuts), but there are so many that visitors will probably find a favorite pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has some of the worst pizza... But I came here at someone's suggestion and was pleasantly surprised: REAL Neopolitan-style pizza to be found! Was like biting into a cloud topped with good quality mozzarella and tomatoes. Will be back. Again and again..."}
{"text":"Cutting to the chase:

*Samoa: coconut-y goodness, tossed with chocolate shavings and caramel. The best (do not argue) Girl Scout cookie, molten and churned and chilled into its gelato form. 5/5
*Nutella: a balanced chocolate with the perfect amount of hazelnut aftertaste. 5/5
*Pistachio: copiously flecked with purple/green pistachio bits. I love nuts. 5/5
*Hazelnut: no visible hazelnut chunks. Too weak of a hazelnut flavor for my nut-craving tastebuds. 3/5

Flavors rotate, so not all flavors may be available on a given day."}
{"text":"I absolutely had to try every flavor and I encourage everyone else to do the same. Once you start you realize they're all going to be really good! It was really difficult to choose and then the guy behind the counter said why choose one, when you could have more? The heavens suddenly opened up so many choices! So go in, try 'em, get at least 3 flavors, and then go back the next day and get some more!!"}
{"text":"Being a pizza afficianado, I make it a point to try every new pizza place. In the past 2 wks, I have gotten both the pizza margherita and the pizza marinara to take home and try. During both visits, I had the same lackluster experience with the employees, The first time, I stood by the register waiting for one of the many servers standing talking at the register to even notice my existence. The 2nd time, I awaited at the register yet again while 2 employees had a heated discussion about how to change the register tape. Nobody acknowledged my presence until one of the pizza makers thankfully exhorted them to help me. Overall, the pizzas were fairly good; however, I think they could afford to add a bit more cheese and tomatoes; the items on the pizza were a bit lacking in quantity. Their biggest hurdle, though, is to perhaps better train and supervise the employees."}
{"text":"A few months back my mom and I were in Shadyside and happened to see all the people outside eating pizzas. A few months later I suggested her and I go and give it a whirl. It was around 7:30 pm when we arrived and for us that is pretty late to be eating dinner. I definitely thought this place wouldn't be as crowded, but news flash to us.... it was packed. When I opened the door all I could see was a line of people waiting to get gelato, so my first instinct was go in the back where the brick oven is and get out of this mess. Once we found a table we were stopped and asked if we seen the hostess. All I could see was a  lot people in line for a cold treat, not a hostess stand. It's a pretty narrow setup inside and I can't say I felt to comfortable from the get go. 

I ended up getting a Margherita pizza and my mom ordered the Melanzana panini which came with eggplant, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, tomato sauce and ricotta cheese. We both ordered our meals at the same time and she ended up getting her meal 15 minutes before me and by the time mine got there, she was done eating. If you know there is a backlog on pizzas then my moms meal shouldn't have been placed when mine was and maybe they could have came out together. When my pizza did finally make it to my table, I wasn't very impressed with the taste. Nothing about it stood out to me and I've had better experiences with other wood fired pizza joints in town. 

With the way dinner went, I was pretty antsy to get out of there. But I figured I should probably try the gelato. Yet another painful experience. It would have been nice to see a list of flavors up on the wall behind the coolers. There was still a large number of people in line and they were standing so close to the glass it was tough to see the flavors; and there is a lot of flavors to be acknowledged! I was really hoping for a better experience than the one my mom and I had. Needless to say I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Needed a quick dinner after a long drive. Ordered a margherita pizza, salad, and a glass of montepulciano. 

The pizza was definitely the highlight. Not the best ever, but very good and fresh. The salad would have been good had there not been huge chunks of salt in every bite. Kind of killed it. And the wine was terrible, but I guess you get what you pay for.

We grabbed some gelato on our way out. I had the hazelnut and could only finish half of it. M had the chocolate peanut butter and wished he'd stuck with regular chocolate. They have a lot of flavors but if none of them are excellent, what does it matter?

Overall probably not the best meal on Walnut St. but they're definitely trying."}
{"text":"This is probably the only place to bother eating at on Walnut street. Fresh, artisanal pizza. Great tasting, light-textured gelato.  Friendly servers and staff. 

The pizza? Fantastic. It will take time for the to make it, and it is not any damned Pizza Hut where they stuff you full of dough. The veggies are fresh, the cheese like velvet, and dough complements all the textures. I actually got accustomed to *not* being full just for the flavor and refreshing nature of a meal here. 

Some issues I have are with the setup of the restaurant itself. It is hard to tell where to sit/stand for pizza or gelato. I walk in and am not sure who to talk to or where to go. Grab a server? Go to the register? Just sit down?  Maybe a hanging sign above where you should go for what you wish to buy would help. (Though that would totally destroy the decor, I know). 

It may just be too small a place given its popularity. It can get crowded and loud with all the traffic. The gelato brings large families, kids, etc. This is kind of cool, but can detract from the dining experience if you are unprepared. 

If the staff seem harried or aloof, it is more because of the bougie restaurant goers that are denizens of the area, than the staff not caring about customers. At least, that is my opinion of all my experiences there. 

The menu is one-page, and it may help if there was some general categorizations of the pizzas there. The list is flat, but since I try to be veggie, it would be nice if there was some breakdown on the pizza types based on general toppings."}
{"text":"Damn you, Mercurios, for opening within walking distance of both my gym, and my apartment.   Go to hell, for having convenient hours into the evening and being so accomodating as to let me taste all the gelatos before I buy.  

THEN you had to go and open your pizza oven and serve delicious pizza at great prices with nice outdoor seating.  TOTALLY NOT NECESSARY.

My thighs will never be the same.

After tasting the Amaretto gelatto, I discovered that my life had been missing something all along and that amaretto gelato wsa its missing piece.

Sounds like I've got a food addiction.  Don't judge me.  Try the gelato and pizza and then you tell me how you're doing SO MUCH BETTER than I am.

;)"}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday around 9pm. Service wasn't that great. Water wasn't refilled in a timely manner and we were never asked how our meal was. The girl dropped one of the slices of bread from our salad onto the table and did not bring us a fresh slice. Our server wasn't rude exactly but I just got the vibe that she was bored and had no interest in being there. 

The food is the reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars. The bruschetta was delicious, as was the house salad. The pizza was pretty good although I much prefer Piccolo Forno in Lawerenceville. Piccolo Forno has better pizza and service. 

On a separate occasion we went for gelato. It's overpriced but it brought back memories from my semester in Italy so if was worth it."}
{"text":"I tried Mercurio's gelato at the big Yelp Tech Shop event in 2013, and I was impressed.  Now that it's only a mile away, I think we're going to have a beautiful relationship.

My dad loves gelato, and when I first tested this place out, I told him he had to try it.  Being the wonderful daughter I am, we hiked South Negley to get over to Walnut street.  The gelato is around $.71/ounce, and they have three different size cups.  The employees are really great about listening to how much you want too, which is nice.

I love the mint chocolate chip, lime, and tiramisu!  All safe choices.  Make sure to sample flavors if you aren't sure what you want.

The pizza is also delicious.  The white pizza ($11) is good, but the prosciutto pizza ($14) is my favorite.  These pizzas are personal sized, but I could split one with a friend and order gelato for a full meal.

The only downside to this place is that the service is pretty eh at the tables.  Not bad but not good either."}
{"text":"Great little pizza and gelato shop. It reminded me of being back in Italy. If I ever return to Pittsburg it will be to eat here."}
{"text":"Everything I wrote before still stands, but I wanted to comment on the prosciutto pomodoro panini that I had today. I've had a LOT of pizza in the last week and I've always wanted to try something else off their menu. It's a nice and simple panini with a deliciously crunchy bread and the tomatoes inside were large and juicy. The flavor of the prosciutto was subtle, but I really appreciated that it wasn't drowned in a bunch of unnecessary sauces and veggies inside which would have made it disappear altogether. It comes with some salad on the side, and I hate salad dressing so I had a bite and really just hated it, but my friend sitting next to me had a bite and ended up eating the whole thing. The panini was great, but I think I prefer eating the pizza - it's more filling and pizza is one of my favorite foods. I'll definitely consider a panini again if I come here without an empty stomach. I also had some blueberry cheesecake gelato which was really delicious. I got it with the samoa flavor, but I would consider getting it on its own next time to really fully appreciate its flavor. BTW, the crust isn't as good dipped with the blueberry cheesecake as it is in the samoa. The service today was also worse than I am used to receiving, our server seemed new and confused and got one of my friend's order wrong, so she got her pizza way later, and then it was still messed up when the check came."}
{"text":"The gelato here is wonderful. Mercurio's offers an extensive variety of flavors, from chocolate to vanilla, Nutella and pistachio, etc. Lots of choices for people with different palates, and best of all, each size allows for scoops from 2 or more flavors. A lovely, creamy texture, and not too heavy or rich.

The pizza I am on the fence about.

Mercurio's offers artisan flavor combinations and I love that it's fired in a brick oven. The crust is both crispy and chewy, a nice consistency in my opinion, but the sauce is SO bland. My companion and I shared a Caprese appetizer (deelish) and a Funghi pizza. The mozzarella on the Funghi was fresh and firm, the basil was strong and flavorful, the mushrooms had a delightful texture, but the sauce was like a wet blanket over all of it. It needs a dash more .. something. Salt, perhaps?

Another gripe I have: the layout. If you're just walking in for gelato, the case is right up front and it's quite convenient. But if you want to dine in, you have to try to squeeze in-between gelato-goers at the front and seated tables on the side just to get to a manager or someone on the wait staff to let them know you want a table and some menus.

Otherwise, service was prompt and friendly. I could see myself eating here again, or, at the very least, coming back for that yummy gelato."}
{"text":"As far as Neapolitan pizzas and gelato, you cannot go wrong with Mercurio's!  I am actually shocked that I have not reviewed this yet... I really thought that I did.  

We come here about once a week, and have never had a bad experience.  I cannot say that I stray too far out of my comfort zone though in terms of what I order.  I always seem to get the Insalata Della Casa and a Margherita pizza (if I do stray, I go with the simple Marinara pizza).  Their gelato is some of the best that I have ever had... especially the Samoa flavored one, or the coconut cream.  In a word... YUM.  

The service is always fast and pleasant too.  The have some wines and beers as well if you would like to enjoy a beverage with your meal.  

I highly recommend checking it out if you have not been here.  It has become one of my top favorite pizzas in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Finding Mercurio's was like finding the Holy Grail. As a Pizza Partisan, Za is my lifeblood, my ambrosia, you could say. I'm dealing with some (temporary) dietary restrictions that make healthy/safe pizza consumption very difficult. Thankfully, Mercurios' au naturale Neapolitans are offered with gluten free crust Monday-Wednesday Isaac-friendly and are absolutely delicious.

ZA REVIEW: Pizza is prepped with a fresh and simple tomato sauce, on a traditional or gluten free crust. Then they sprinkle homemade mutz and toppings on the pie before cooking. Upon removal, fresh olive oil (and basil if in the recipe) is applied, the server cuts the pizza in four, and delivers it piping hot your table. The cornicione (crust space) in my gluten free pie was a little too wide for my taste, and the coastline (space of sauce between cheese and crust) was a bit too wide, even for Neopolitan standards. Essentially, my pie could have been formed with more care (check posted photos). Regardless, flavor, quality of ingredients, CSC (crust-cheese-sauce) ratio and freshness were all on par. I give Mercurio's gluten free pizza a 7.3/10 pepperonis. I will return o review when I can eat the standard crust. 

My parents and I split two small gelatos: chocolate PB cup and dulche de leche. They were to die for, I had a small amount and it didn't make me sick so hell yeah!

SERVICE REVIEW: Frankly, in terms of service, I was disappointed. I understand the virtue and pride a restaurant holds toward the sanctity of its menu items, but refusing to make substitutions based off of my mom's dietary needs came across as cocky. The customer is always right, and if my mom REALLY wanted some to substitute a heavy meat with basil on her pizza, couldn't they have done so? Furthermore, my pizza came a good 5 minutes before my parents', so there was an undesirable consumption lag. Lastly, they took one of the extra chairs from our table which really doesn't mean much but I had this awkward open space to my left, and what if I my imaginary friend was sitting there?

BOTTOM LINE: Mercurio's is a WONDERFUL neopolitan pizza and gelato destination in Shadyside. Their ingredients are fresh and their pies savory. They are knowledgeable and passionate about their food, which is attests to the strength of their menu, but is also incurs perceivable weakness; lacking to some customers who want and need accommodations to eat. Mercurio's gets 4 stars because of these traits, and for providing me with Italian Pie in my struggling times."}
{"text":"My favorite spot! I take out at least once a week and get the gelato a bit too frequently as well. Great place for dates, for families, and awesome take out as well. It's not your typical pizza place, you should have high standards, it's a must try!

-The guy from across the street!"}
{"text":"We got the bianca pizza and it was delicious! Food was fast, gelato was tasty, friendly staff. Crowded, but not overwhelming."}
{"text":"I've been to Italy many times and can say that the pizza was on par with some of the Italian pizzas I've had! Delicious! The gelato was pretty good but it wasn't as good as the gelato I've had in Italy. Still better than a lot of ice cream places in Pittsburgh, and lots of options! Definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"Good gelato at a high price.

Mercurio's is a neat little gelato place located in the heart of Shadyside. The atmosphere is very classy and feels very much like a place where adults would enjoy a sweet treat. The selection is great and the flavors all sound very delicious. I was a little confused by the menu located behind the freezers, which may have contributed to the high cost of my gelato. Ultimately I ended up buying the medium-sized, two flavor gelato... which can range in weight up to 3oz (or $2.50) depending on how the server decides to scoop it.

While the gelato is excellent, it is overpriced in my opinion. I don't think I can justify spending $6 on a tiny dish of frozen goodness, no matter how good it may be. This place will be an occasional treat but isn't likely to be a frequent stop."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Mercurio's?!  They recently reopened at their new location right on Walnut Street and are in the process of putting in a pizza oven as well.  My personal favorite flavor is the strawberry cheesecake gelato but unfortunately it's hardly ever on rotation.  I keep going back for more of it with limited success.  Mango, key lime and peanut butter are almost as equally delicious and those aren't even their \"bestsellers.\"  They have so many flavors to choose from that you'll have to go back to try them all!  It's a little more pricey than your typical ice cream but it's well worth the extra cost.  I always go with the small size and it's just enough to quench your craving without making you feel guilty.  You know it's good when you're trying to find excuses to stop in Shadyside so you can swing by and grab a cup of gelato when you live in the North Hills!"}
{"text":"My wife and I met another couple for pizza and gelato on Saturday night.  It was moderately busy when we arrived but we were seated quickly.  The food was good except for the sausage pizza which was super greasy.  After our meal we got gelato, but it took multiple attempts to order because they were out of half of the menu selections.

I didn't mind that our bill was $80 for 4 small pizzas and 4 small cups of gelato, but I did mind being shooed out of our seats by a waiter who said that they had a private party coming and that we had to leave.  

I have never been treated like this before and we definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"If you wanna enjoy terrace or outside, go to a Mercurio's. Their prosciutto pizza was pretty good. A waitress was kind!"}
{"text":"We went here tonight and it was so yummy. I had the chocolate chip cheesecake. It was delicious and didn't have that awful fake cheesecake flavor. It was buttery. Almost like a toffee flavor. And rich/creamy!

I was surprised at how cheap it was. Plus, the place is clean and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here many a time for their gelato. My favorite is the cantaloupe, which is super hard to find in the States!

But I finally tried the pizza here, and was pleasantly surprised at how authentic it was! Props for NOT adding oregano to the sauce! I thought the crust could use a little more char and chew but this is me being picky...it's really, really good pizza. Way better than overhyped Piccolo Forno!

I have to say it's sad that they only have one pizza topped with Mozzarella di Bufala, and when I asked if I could get another pizza with Bufala, I got the \"no substitutions\" BS. Come on, it's not really a substitution...it's more like I'll pay you extra to upgrade my cheese. Nope, they wouldn't have it.

The pricing is also weird. The Margherita is $9 (very reasonable) but the exact same pizza, with Bufala, is $15 (overpriced, IMO). Il Pizzaiolo only has a $3 difference between their regular and Bufala Margheritas, which are more expensive, but much bigger.

While my heart still belongs to Il Pizzaiolo, this is a great option if you're craving DOC pizza and don't want to leave the East End. Especially if you want gelato for dessert!"}
{"text":"I didn't try other food yet. But it was good dessert place.
Also, you can use your Samsung pay here!!!"}
{"text":"I love love love love love mercurio's!! I have never been disappointed by this place. Their pizzas are simple yet delicious and great authentic italian quality, and they have every type of flavour you'd ever want of gelato :)"}
{"text":"Their pizza and icecream are delicious. I haven't find any other place with so good pizza nor icecream in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh. I love the pizzas, salads, and of course the gelato. The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean and even kind of cozy. I usually go there with my boyfriend and we split a salad and a pizza, then we each get a small gelato. I leave feeling not overstuffed but perfectly satisfied. My favorite pizza is the del ray pizza. So delicious. This place has never disappointed me."}
{"text":"I got hooked on gelato in North Beach in San Francisco. I discovered this fantastic little place this weekend (there is gelato that tastes like blueberry muffins; how did I not know of its existence until now!?) and spent a few glorious minutes eating some of the creamiest, yummiest concoction.

The best part here is the variety. Literally dozens of flavors to choose from. While standing in the line that was nearly out the door, I read a printout of yelp reviews--one of which suggested ordering a variety of flavors in one cup. Brilliant. I ordered half dark chocolate stracciatella and half strawberry cheesecake in one cup (ugly cups, sorry-- plain white would be classier! but how am I complaining when there is heaven. in my mouth.). The strawberry cheesecake won me over far more than the chocolate, but that's the beauty of ordering different flavors.

I officially have a new Saturday ritual in the form of gelato. I think I'll spend weekdays devising strategies for choosing gelato flavors only to order on a whim when the weekend arrives. Mercurio's Mulberry, you are my new obsession."}
{"text":"Pizza and gelato, wow turns out the two work well together! They make all the pizzas to order in a wood fire oven, real pizza with the freshest ingredients, we had the Italian sausage and it was amazing to say the least, as was the bruschetta. They also have about 30 different flavors of gelato which really hit the spot! Very friendly staff too!!"}
{"text":"Mercurio's embodies everything that is Shadyside. The food is expensive, the staff are pompous, and the clientele are upper crust. Nevertheless, I must admit the food is good and one of my favorites within walking distance; but stick with the pizza and house salad ($15 at the very least). The panini's are sub-par and the appetizers are terribly overpriced (just like everything else here). Gellato is also quite good. Definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a bit of a miser, but for over four dollars, I should get three times that much product.  But let's get real: this is Walnut Street, so it's going to be overpriced!

The ice cream (or gelato or frozen dairy treat or whatever it's called) was delicious, though.  But I still felt that little pit-in-the-stomach feeling of \"Crap, I just spent way too much money on something I didn't need,\" while I was eating it, which sort of ruined the experience.

If money ain't a thang, this is probably a pretty awesome place."}
{"text":"why so burnt? who serves burnt food? weird attitude as if they walk on water and are never wrong"}
{"text":"Pretty solid pizza.  The crust is perfect and the wine selections complement them beautifully.  Gelato is quite nice too."}
{"text":"The food here was good, but the prices are outrageous.

I am by no means stingy, and I was expecting to pay a little more for a gourmet pizza... But $17 for a 12\" diameter pizza with a couple pieces of prosciutto on top? Never again. It's a shame, because I did like the pizza and it would be nice to have a good Italian-style pizza every once in a while.

The gelato is really good, so I'll just stick to that in the future."}
{"text":"Been to Pittsburgh many times, have eaten all over the place. My favorite for pizza is Mercurios. Baked in the neopolitan style in a wood fired oven the along with use of  fresh ingredients is their recipe for success. The shop occupies a bright cheery space in the Shadyside section of Pittsburgh. As an added bonus enjoy a tasty gelato a great way to top off your meal. Good prices good service and pleasant atmosphere. 
Belisimo."}
{"text":"Mercurio's is back -- bigger and badder, if only in its space. The serving size seems to have shrunk a bit and/or the price seems a little higher than in my (granted, not always infallible) memory. 

The gelato is still good, and the selection is still wide, but a lot of the bins looked more than half empty without being replaced. 

The space is pleasing and airy and spacious. Instead of the cramped little second floor store of yore, Mercurio's now has beautiful picture windows that look right onto Walnut. It can now accommodate more than one group of sit down customers. However, I feel like it lost a bit of its quirky charm in the process. Now, it looks like any other Walnut establishment -- polished in a generic way.

The people who worked the counter, however, didn't seem to really want to be there. I suppose I did show up on a late Saturday afternoon, so the servers may be anxious to end their shifts. 

I was so excited when I found out that they've re-opened, but I have to admit, my first re-visit was something of a disappointment. Maybe I just caught them on a bad day, or maybe they still have a few more issues to work out during their transition period. I'll try them again in a few more weeks. For now though, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Five stars for the gelato, including a *delicious* no-sugar-added butter pecan for us sugar-avoiders.  A bit of a stylish joint though so don't come in your flip-flops and sweatpants!"}
{"text":"Went here again today for lunch and had a good time. I had the mushroom penne appetizer and bruschetta. They must have replaced their mean staff because the servers were really sweet now :)"}
{"text":"As soon as the new store opens, my husband and I will be there ASAP.  Best gelato, better than ice cream, and so (SO) many good flavors.  I nearly had an emotional breakdown right on Copeland when I saw they had vacated their previous location (I thought they were gone for good!).  So happy to find out they are just moving."}
{"text":"I only stopped into the cute little shop for a quick gelato with a friend and I'm glad that I did!

Its a very cute shop that offers food and gelato.

I tried the Mango Gelato, and also the Salted Caramel Gelato and it was good!  :)
I'll def revisit, I'd be very curious to try some of the tasty flat breads that were coming out of the kitchen area!"}
{"text":"Really tasty Neapolitan pizza and gelato. The staff is friendly and the food is reasonably priced.  The lasagna pizza which is a margarita with the addition of ricotta and crumbled sausage is delicious. Also love the caprese salad."}
{"text":"I fell in love with the Samoa gelato: coconut & chocolate.

See www.mulberrystreetcreamery.com"}
{"text":"The Nutella Gelato was delicious.  I imagine all their other flavors are good as well. I plan to go back and try the pizza."}
{"text":"I am not a fancy-pizza type of person.  I like things plain and predictable.  I came here with some adventurous eaters and didn't want to ostracize myself by admitting I was horrified!  I'm glad I played it cool.  The pizza is awesome.  I understand why people like fresh pizza now! The crust is awesome! I had never even heard of gelato before, but now I love it.  Be brave, try this place!"}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the fact that they are a gelateria and a pizzeria in one. I wasn't intrigued enough to order a pizza. I had been a good boy and was walking by when I decided that I could actually indulge in some form of ice cream. I really like chocolate. I love hazelnut. Seeing that I could get both I had them give me half and half in a cup.

Yum!

Definitely some of the better gelato I have ever eaten. I will definitely return here when I get a chance. I cannot eat a lot of ice cream at any given time and the sheer power in the flavor that comes through makes up for the small amounts that I can eat.

YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the flavors are true to the taste, if that make sense. For example, the blueberry muffin, actually tastes like a blueberry muffin. That's usually my go to flavor, but I've tried others and they've always been delish. I've frequented their previous location on Copeland and happy to see them back on Walnut. 

I read from the other reviews about the discomfort in the store due to the lack of coolness or overabundance of warmth...I either didn't notice it or I was too busy with my eyes glazed over at all the flavors...it could be that once I order, I leave the store immediately, so warm or cold, doesn't affect my enjoyment of the deliciousness known as Mercurio's."}
{"text":"Mercurio's is a decent little place that features neapolitan pizza and a couple of other pizza toppings. My rating is based primarily on the dining options and not the gelato options.

The good: I actually like their pizza dough which has a nice consistency and has those little burn marks that make it feel \"authentic\". One of their appetizers has pistachio pesto served on a pizza crust with some orange zest and I liked the combination.

The less good: the toppings are sometimes inconsistent with some pizza ending up delicious and some ... umm just not so much. We tried only the veggie panini and it was ok. Their salads appear interesting on the menu but they were a hit or miss for me. 

I've had both dinner and lunch there and for some reason for dinner we got served much faster than for lunch. 

I don't know why it has only one dollar sign for the price because their menu item are definitely more. A pizza + a shared appetizer can definitely get you around $20."}
{"text":"Loved the gelato here, plenty of options! Didn't get to try any pizza but it also looked great."}
{"text":"I came here for the pizza the other night as I've heard other friends raving about it.  I was a bit skeptical that a gelato place could make good pizza, but I was proven wrong.

I ordered the Pizza del Re, which sounded absolutely splendid.  Truffle oil, mushrooms, fresh mozzarella, and prosciutto di parma.  As I suspected, it was pretty friggin amazing.  The prosciutto and the truffle oil made it stand out though.  It was such a wonderful medley of flavor.  The only reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars was the crust.  It got kind of soggy and reminded me more of a pita rather than pizza crust.  It was OK... but definitely could be improved.  However, I can't wait to try some of their other pizza options.  This definitely has become one of my favorite pizza places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Well, if you've never been to Italy and wondered what's pizza like in Italy, this is a place to try... On the other hand, if you've been to Italy and really miss the Italian pizza, this is the place to go as well..."}
{"text":"I tried their Gelato during the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix and bookmarked them. I finally was in the area and was glad to see they also had pizza so my wife and I decided to give their pizza a shot, since all the other reviews were so encouraging. We were not disappointed. Their crust is wood fired and their ingredients are extremely fresh. The pizza we got Is the Bianca, what typically is a Margarita. Very fresh, thick and juicy tomatoes, nice cheese and topped with basil and garlic. I would say it's one of the best \"pure\" pizzas I've had. The Gelato tasted just as good as what brought me here. I got the Black Cherry and it was awesome. For $17, we got a pizza to share and a Gelato. That is some good value"}
{"text":"Husband and I have been exploring Pittsburgh's unique neighborhoods, and last week it was time for Shadyside.  We visited on a whim one afternoon and ended up at Mercurio's for lunch.  My guy had been craving pizza, and I particularly like white pizza, so Mercurio's on popular Walnut Street fit the bill.

I enjoyed the Neapolitan white (\"bianca\") pizza we ordered.  At $10 the price was right, though a few more slices of tomato and some more basil leaves would have been nice.  I tend to like thin crust that's more doughy than crisp, and for me there was just the right amount of crispiness and black at the edge of the crust.  Those who prefer a firmer crust would probably be disappointed to some degree, and that likely explains why my husband didn't like the pie as much as I did.

A nice surprise here was the affordable wine selection.  We selected and really enjoyed a $22 bottle.

Cute place with a nice atmosphere, and there's seating inside and out.  Beautiful stone pizza oven with a tiled exterior.  Service was smiling, efficient, and attentive.

The area near the front door is mostly dedicated to gelato, and Mercurio's boasts quite a few flavors--at least a couple dozen, I'm sure.  After we explored Walnut Street and nearby Ellsworth Avenue we ended up back at Mercurio's so my guy could grab some gelato, which he really liked, incidentally.  I thought it was odd, however, that the gelato cups come in sizes yet customers are charged by the ounce?  This is not serve-yourself gelato, and in my opinion if sizes are offered the customer should pay by the size.  Makes me wonder if the owner/management doesn't trust employees to scoop properly.  I don't know; it just rubbed me the wrong way a little bit, sort of like bars that have measuring guns.

Would return for the pizza and wine.  Panini on the menu also caught my eye."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Thursday for a snack of sorts with my girlfriend.  Both of us had been wanting to try Mecurios as we both used to love the place whenever it was only a small gelato shop.  The inside of the restaurant was interesting with what seemed like half of the shop for employees and the other half for patrons.  This was further divided by the gelato area which had around 20 different selections and 2 reserved tables and the restaurant which had a nice looking wood brick oven and the rest of the tables.

My girlfriend and I decided to start off out meal with the pesto pistachio antipasti which was pistachio and basil pesto with cheese and orange zest served on a pizza crust.  The flavors were good and I enjoyed both the pesto sauce and pizza crust but the real winner was the orange zest.  It was prevalent enough that you could taste it and its citrusy flavor but did not overpower the pistachio and basil.  For our main pizza to split my girlfriend and I decided on the salame calibrese which was a pizza topped with tomatoes, basil, EVOO, mozzarella and salame.  The crust tasted the same as the first and was good but I didn't think the bottom was firm enough.  Now I don't want to go arguing with the AVPN but I want to be able to pick up my pizza to eat it but with this I could not and had to use a fork.  Even with that being said the pizza was still good and the salame giving a nice saltiness to it.

The bottom line for me is that I will probably head back here in the future.  Granted that it may be for Gelato but there is always the off chance that I could order a pizza again and I would shy away if someone else wanted to go here."}
{"text":"Great Italian style pizza! I'm no longer in Pittsburgh, but when I was living in Shadyside I would regularly go to Mercurio's not only because it was conveniently located to home, but because the pizza and salad are great especially if you're craving flavors that closely match what you'd find in Italy. I wish I still lived near this pizzeria, and will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I went for the gelato and it was great. The servers are happy to let you try some samples and they're all delicious! As a coffee lover I enjoyed the espresso flavor. There were about 30 options in total.

It was a Friday night at 9 and the place was moderately busy but still able to find a table for my small group right away. Quiet enough to have a convo , and right on to Walnut St to do some people watching through the tinted windows. Overall good ambience and worth a return for more gelato or dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Mercurio's for the first time tonight for a light dinner before happy hour at another restaurant in Shadyside. The restaurant was pretty quiet - even for a weekday (Thursday) night - with only about 10-12 customers in the restaurant throughout our dinner.

Our waitress Ivy quickly greeted us when we came into the restaurant. She was attentive throughout our meal, bringing my husband a couple drink refills and checking on us several times. All the pizzas on the menu looked tasty, and we asked Ivy for recommendations. She listed four of her favorites, most highly recommending the Bianco (garlic, basil, parmigiano reggiano) and the Pizza Del Re (truffle spread, mushrooms, and prosciutto). The Pizza Del Re looked like the more unique option, so we decided to split that.

The pizza was a unique and delicious combination of toppings. The $6-16 price point for the various pizzas is very reasonable for both the restaurant's Shadyside location and the quality of food delivered. The size of the pizza is either sharing size for a light dinner or will probably require a takeout box if just ordered by one. The wait was about 15 minutes for our pizza. Though the wait time was very reasonable, I would be concerned about how long the wait would be if the restaurant was packed.

Though we just tried pizza tonight, walking by the gelato was nearly resistible. The flavors were extensive and looked absolutely delicious. I came so close to ordering some, but then thought it best to wait until next time since I was heading to happy hour. Cannot wait to come back and try the gelato in the future... it looks no less than heavenly!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just an off night... But Mercurio's did not live up to the hype this past Friday evening. I wanted to love it - I expected to love it...

Ever since last month's Yelp event, Under the Big Top, when I was introduced to Mercurio's pizza and gelato - I have heard nothing but good things. Friday night seemed like the perfect opportunity to check it out in person.

We ordered 2 pies: The Bianco and the Salsiccia e Funghi. Both pizzas arrived very quickly to our table, and slightly burnt. The ingredients were very fresh and light, however the pizza dough was a fluffy, naan-like consistency. It's not that the pizza was bad, but for the hype that has surrounded the pizza and experience, it was hardly remarkable. For all the Italian home style fan fare that you're presented with, you'll not find anything on the menu besides a few salads and pizza variations. 

I was even more surprised that there wasn't a dedicated chef, but rather a few individuals and an enlarged convection oven. I am sad to say that I felt like there was more attention to detail at the previous Yelp event than at the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"Authentic brick oven pizza! Thin crust ... And delicious !! The atmospheres is like a normal pizzeria with gelato ... For starters we had the bruschetta fresh and amazing !! Then We ordered the traditional Margarita pizza and mushroom pizza .. Both were very good !! Wrapped it up with a lil gelato ,, fig and almond, different but good"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the gelato selection and the pizzas have yet to let me down.

It's not traditional American pizza in the sense that it's not overwhelmingly greasy and heavy. Their pizza is light and even refreshing, and you don't feel gross after eating it. The salads leave a little to be desired as a meal, but would be great alongside a pizza.

The gelato selection is always great and the prices are reasonable, especially for the location. All in all, a great place for great pizza, especially if you want a break from the Aiello's v. Mineo's debate"}
{"text":"I go at least once a week. My favorite is the Panzanella Salad, best in the city by far."}
{"text":"This place was like walking into a shop in Italy or maybe it was our waiter with the strong accent. We order the whole nine yards at this place and got out of there only spending $55-$60 (including tip)!  

We started off with a White Riesling and a Stella beer with our Portabella Mushroom and Arugula Salad... This salad is by far the most simple yet detailed salad I've had. It's really earthy but in the best way. I say this because my beau def. isn't interested in 'earthy' food but he loved it as much as me!

Next we ordered our pizzas, our waiter recommended both these pizza's as his two favorites. Mine was a truffle mushroom and my beau's was the Porchetta!  Not greasy, all hand made and you can watch! Both pizzas were amazing but I can say that mine was the favorite. The pizza is def. not American and that's why I loved it. 

After dinner we grabbed gelato which takes up half the restaurant! We both got the pistachio and it was a great sweet treat after all the flavors we enjoyed during dinner.  

This place is a great place for dates... We were actually there again this past weekend! The people there are very welcoming and really make this spot a gem. The only down fall is the narrowness of the front of the place but that's because it's growing very popular now a days ;)

{"text":"I got to try a few different kinds of gelato. I discovered this place while looking for Salud juicery. I LOVED everything i tried. I wish they sold their gelato by the pint! I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in this city by far. Oliva for the win! The straciatella gelato, however, tastes like soap. Just say no. GO FOR THE PIZZA NOWWWW."}
{"text":"The real deal!

Was here when I was visiting Pittsburgh for the Memorial day weekend and stumbled upon this place when me and the hubby decided to get dinner when our daughter was asleep in the stroller. Our waiter, Justin was great in suggesting vegetarian pizza options for us. We ended up getting the Margherita and the award-winning pizza with mushrooms and truffle oil. I can't say enough good things about the pizza, it was like we were back in Italy. They have a good simple wine list to compliment the Italian flavors. When I whispered to Justin that we were celebrating my husband's b'day he lit up some candles on a large cup of b'day-cake gelato and made it special.. Thanks for making the evening a very memorable one!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Mercurio's! The staff is really nice and the pizza (and gelato) is delicious!

The appetizers are pretty basic and the sandwiches are decent, but I don't set out craving either when the thought of going to Mercurio's comes up. My wife loves the insalata della casa, and I enjoy their fresh cheese on the caprese, but I wouldn't necessary recommend either. I go straight for the pizza.

My favorite pizza is the marinara. As much as I love cheese, there's something about their sauce that keeps bringing me back to their most basic offering. I've had the margherita, salsiccia, and the pizza Roberto, too...all delicious (although the burrata is almost too much for me on the Roberto...you better be craving cheese for that one)! Their crust is perfection and the pizzas are a good size for an individual. I never feel miserably full after eating their pizza, either, which is a great thing...because...gelato! 

Mercurio's has an excellent variety of gelato flavors to explore, and I've never really been disappointed. There are flavors that I've enjoyed more than others, but that's purely subjective. The freshness and wonderful texture of gelato has never let me down. My personal favorites are dulce de leche and samoa. Samoa is my go-to, but the former is a solid backup selection when the latter runs out.

The space is smal, so be prepared to be huddled up closely to other patrons. You're also guaranteed to leave smelling like waffle cones and pizza, so be happy it's a casual place. It gets really busy in the evenings and weekends, but the wait isn't usually too long. You can always get the No Wait app and get in line ahead of time if you're hoping to avoid a long wait."}
{"text":"I wish I could write separate reviews for their gelato and for the rest of their food. The gelato would easily get 5-stars. It's not as rich as real Italian gelato, but the flavors are excellent. 

As for the food, well, it's just okay. After the Yelp Elite event there (which was awesome!) my wife and I went back for lunch and had the bufala mozzarella pizza and the portobello salad. The pizza tasted okay, but the consistency was all off. The dough was soggy (too much sauce??) and limp, and nothing actually stayed on the pizza (it all just fell right off). The salad was also okay (the lemon zest was a nice touch), but it was pretty uninspired. Just a bunch of arugula and maybe 1/2 a mushroom cap...that's it.  If I were in a pinch, I would probably go back...but it won't be my top choice.

That said, get the gelato!"}
{"text":"Good, friendly service. Gelato was a 10/10. The menu is small, but the pizzas were good with a great crust and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I tried the eggplant panini"}
{"text":"I really want to give Mercurio's 4.5 stars: First, the pizza is thin and light. Our server told us the 10-12\" pies are single serving, but our table of four decided to get just two. One couple also got a salad to share. That way we all had room for gelato, which was also light and flavorful. I found the pizza menu difficult to read, because each pie differs from its neighbor very slightly; I wish they had just listed the unique topping instead the whole list of 4-5 ingredients that differed only at the end. If anything, the gelato list is even more impressive, with quite a number of different chocolate flavors: we tried the death by chocolate, raspberry truffle, black cherry chocolate, and molten lava. Besides the confusing pizza menus, minus half a star because we had to wait quite a while for a server to even come by to get our drink orders. It seemed like he might be the only waiter; they really needed to have another server for the size and busyness of the restaurant, which includes outside tables in good weather. Nevertheless, we will most likely be back."}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on the gelato. But the amount of flavors and quality of gelato is just. so. good. Whether it's 5 degrees or 95 degrees I don't go by this place without heading inside for a cup of goodness. 

Their flavors rotate often which is nice to keep me wanting to come back and try new ones. Everything is done by weight so you can get as little or as much as you'd like. 

The underdog and underrated flavor is the blueberry muffin. It is mm mmm good! Just give it a taste test before you decide and you won't be disappointed. 

I can't wait to try the delicious pizza that I heard so much about next."}
{"text":"I am not a Neopolitan pizza expert by any means; Mercurio's was my first experience with the cuisine. First, the food:

I ordered the Pizza Marinara, and it was delicious. The crust was amazing, and the few ingredients in a marinara all shined. The pizzas are just the right size for one hungry person. I would honestly take such a humble pizza over most of the more deluxe American pies, any day of the week. The house red wine was also great - not too sweet, not too dry. 

The service - The chef had an accident and injured himself by dropping some plates. I didn't hear it; I was sitting outside. But, it pushed the time back. The waitress was very pleasant, she explained the situation, and gave us free appetizers, in my opinion this was just the ticket. 

The atmosphere - friendly people, nice outdoor seats. You can see the chef working, and see the epic brick oven and stacks of firewood, very cool. The bathrooms were also really nice - the whole restaurant is like a long skinny corridor, and the bathroom is too. They have the dyson airblade hand dryers, which are fun to use. 

The only thing I would change is to specify what wines are organic; they mention that they serve organic wine on the website, but the menu doesn't say which are organic. 

Overall, a very memorable experience, I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"It is so much more than gelatos!  Sure gelatos are a must here, but wowza, what pizza, what salads, what fresh ingredients and much more!"}
{"text":"For those of us who can't hop a plane to Italy every year, this is the next best thing. The pizza and gelato will BLOW YOU AWAY."}
{"text":"pizza is very good.  the have a very good wine list by the glass.  we did not have dessert, but they were selling a lot of gelato to a lot of happy people."}
{"text":"It was ok. We are from Jersey, so we are picky about pizza. The pizza was on the doughy side and probably could have been cooked longer. Not much sauce or cheese either. My husband tried the milkshake cookies n cream. Again, he said it was ok. Not the best, not the worst."}
{"text":"This was one of the best caprese salads i had in a long while.  Highly recommend. 
It wasn't my favorite pizza in town but it was good pizza also."}
{"text":"Mercurio's is the best pizza I've had in a long time! I ordered the Quattro Formaggi pizza and it was delicious -- four different cheeses with basil and extra virgin olive oil. The crust was simply fantastic -- the perfect balance between doughy and firm. My mom ordered the Prosciutto pizza and we couldn't agree on which pizza was better. 

Mercurio's isn't too terribly large, so there isn't an abundance of seating. I wouldn't necessarily choose this restaurant if I was dining with 5+ people. It seemed pretty crowded when I was in there, but overall the atmosphere is nice and the service was good. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Such a lovely little find on Walnut Street!  Gleaming glass displays of gelatos await as you stroll through the door...it looks like a painter's palette of deliciousness all ready for sampling.  So sample away!  Friendly servers/scoopers are generous with tiny silver spoons laden with whatever temptation tickles your curious gelato fancy. The staff is so friendly and helpful!  

After extensive sampling, I chose Blackberry Merlot for my first scoop and the totally decadent Dark Chocolate Salted Caramel.  Rich, smooth, cold, creamy luscious frozen cream teeming with flavors that made me swoon with happiness.  Bravissimo!

Oh, and lest you think Mercurio's is for sweets only, the pizzas, salads and other treats are authentic Italian masterpieces, as well!  The pizzas, straight from the brick oven imported from Italy, were gorgeous!  Word is (that old gluten devil prevented me from sampling the pizzas) the flavors matched the beauty of the crusts and toppings.  Speaking of toppings....Mercurios makes their own mozzarella!!!!!  Wow.

That gluten issue regarding pizza at Mercurios may soon be a thing of the past.  Linda Mercurio's husband (Dr. Mercurio!) is diligently working on a gluten-free crust!  Once he has perfected it, gluten-free pizza will be on the menu and I, for one, cannot wait!"}
{"text":"Incredible neopolitan pizza and gelato! Doesn't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"I've visited on a few occasions and enjoyed pizza and gelato. Today was strictly a gelato trip. I opted for two chocolate flavors: molten lava cake and European chocolate with pecans. The lava cake had pieces of chocolate cake and fudge sauce and the European had full pieces of pecans! This is the best gelato in the  Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first foray into this time-honored spot. My wife and I were welcomed into the establishment without difficulty, and were led to a clean table in no time at all.

We were served by an efficient waitress, who made sure we had a great lunch experience. It would have been a 5 star review, except for the dead flies on the windowsill... All 4 of them.

It really was a shame - we had heard so many great things about this place - my mouth salivated when good amigos presented their plea.... We ordered simply  - two pizzas - a Margherita and a mushroom pizza.

I will also add that these pizzas were tasty and clean, but were not of the quality that you would get at several other close-by establishments - Piccolo Forno (5-star) and Dinette (5-star). Now, the price point is very much different between all three restaurants, but I absolutely KNOW that this place can achieve more with some oversight and guidance... The brick oven can be used for much more quality, rather than volume.

Will definitely be back - I want to see if this place will up the game!"}
{"text":"This was a great spot when I lived here. I used to walk to this spot on walnut street when I lived here in college. So I came here again and it was just the same. They have traditional flat bread Italian pizzas that are personal sized and when you first walk in there are an assorted flavors of gelato which is what I came for. They let you sample the flavors first. I usually get death by chocolate but they ran out so I went with the European chocolate (which is a good replacement but not the same) and dulce de leche. I got the small cup which holds 2 to 4 oz and two flavors. It's about 76 cents and ounce and my total way $4 something which isn't bad at all. We got there around 945 which is close to closing (about an hour before closing). They were out of a lot of good flavors so I was bummed. I think they should have more of the flavors that are popular because some of their flavors weren't touched at all, and there was still a decent amount of people coming in for gelato."}
{"text":"Mercurios is a staple for me. I know that every time that I come here I am going to have a nice hearty Italian meal. I know what to expect and that is what I like about it. It's also a neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is very idiosyncratic; let me explain. The mozzarella is housemade. I could taste that the dough was housemade too. It was very soft, almost pita like, yet it retained char from the brick oven giving it a smoky taste. Simply, a unique crust. The tomato sauce tasted fresh and unique too. If I was a betting man, I'd wager that the tomato sauce is housemade too. I'll also mention that most of (if not all of) the pies cost $15 or less. The quality certainly places Mercurio's pies in Pittsburgh's elite class of pizza..

Now the gelato. There are about forty flavors. I settled on the Salted Caramel Truffle. Honestly, I felt like I was in a TV commercial for ice cream as I enjoyed it. The base was luscious and creamy. The gooey caramel and the crisp chocolate truffle bites created for textural contrast. Altogether, it was rich and delicious, yet not overbearing.

A few final points: The service here is very fast; I sat near the oven and witnessed my pizza being taken out of the oven and brought to my table within a minute. The waitresses were very attentive. I also liked the atmosphere. The staff seemed to enjoy working there. There were small subtleties which indicated that this was clearly a small business striving to offer a completely gratifying experience.They also have several beers on tap (Peroni, New Castle, Stella, and a seasonal draught which was North Country Brewing Co.'s Buck Up Black Pale Ale - a beer from Slippery Rock) - all of which were $5 or less.

Mercurio's does not settle on quality."}
{"text":"I live down the street from Mercurio's and have been there many times; a few for food and countless for the gelato. The food is good; the pizza is good, the calzone is very good and, despite what my bf thinks, the gelato is great. 

My problem with this place is the STAFF!!!!  In all the times I have been there I've had 1 positive experience with the staff. ONE! The staff are frequently goofing around, talking, texting (my favorite) and generally treat you as if you are interrupting their day by patronizing their establishment. It's not just the actual sit-down wait staff either. The gelato servers are always young and bitchy. Sometimes it seems the only constant in this this place is the revolving door of young and bitchy staff. I know some people who have worked there and from what I understand the owners know about this and overlook it. They hire friends, and friends of friends, and no one gets reprimanded. That's the worst part for me. I work in a service based industry where there is no excuse for poor service and my BF is a long time bartender/bar manager. I know good service and how to tip for it. Having said that, we don't seem to want to go to Mercurio's anymore, and it's not because of the food."}
{"text":"Pizzas were terrible, not well baked at all. Toppings weren't generous. Sandwiches were small in size and there weren't too many options."}
{"text":"Order carry out for lunch today and was very happily surprised! For a place that advertises it's pizza and gelato mainly, I was very pleased to find Panini and Salad options. I ordered the Italiano panini, which comes with a side salad. Not bad for $8.50. I called during lunch rush, and there was only a 15 minute wait. Only thing that I would have liked to see are more side options! Sometimes I want fries with my sandwich!"}
{"text":"I am not a pizza person (maybe eating pizza less than 6 times a year) but everytime I come to Pittsburgh, I will make sure I come here and get it. Mercurio's pizza has the right thickness and completely suit my palette."}
{"text":"Could no believe my mother and I paid over $10 for a small cone and a microscopic dish.  The prices here I think are absolutely crazy, and the Gelato isn't even made fresh there?

That was my first problem with the place.  I asked the girl if the Gelato is made fresh, and she responded yes.  But then when I questioned it because the Gelato was so hard, she admitted they order it from a place that makes it; then, it is shipped frozen.  

I'm not trying to sound like an ass, but if I am paying over $10 for two Gelatos, they should be freshly made that morning.  FAIL"}
{"text":"I came here for some good gelato on a sunny week day and that is what I got. The gelato was delicious and the small was certainly enough for me. I decided to get the dark chocolate with chocolate pieces in it and my friend got the chocolate turtle flavor. Both were amazing and I will definitely be back to try some more this summer. They also have outdoor seating, which is perfect."}
{"text":"There are so many gelato flavors! It's hard keeping myself from sampling all the flavors. I try to limit myself to 3 before picking one. My most recent favorite is something that sounded like \"salty turtle.\" It was rich and caramel-y. 

The regular menu of pizza and such looks SO good from the glances at the tables while I've waited in line. If I'm ever on Walnut Street, and this place is open, I have to stop by and get a gelato, no matter what the weather. Mercurio's gelato is always in season.

A small gelato could be around $3, medium around $5. 

I think I've grown to expect to see a Mercurio's booth at a Yelp event (which is AWESOME)."}
{"text":"This is a gelato and pizza shop. The gelato you can get any way you like. The pizza only comes their way. No build your own pie... menu offers about 15, or so, combinations with a \"no substitutions\" note. 

Also the sauce is sweet, so great! If that's your thing. But it's not mine. I also like to mix up my toppings.  No can do. 

Service was adequate. Clearly this is a well loved local establishment, so why not give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by some fellow yelpers so I gave it a try. Along with the livingsocial deal that I purchased for half off. It was a good deal too spend $10 get $20.

So the atmosphere is very italian with a lovely wooden floor and tables. The menu was a traditional one with the titles of the foods written in Italian. We sat directly outside the oven with a glass window covering the view of the pizza making process. We ordered a funghi pizza to share along with a house salad all for $20 bucks. The salad was tasty with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing and a delicious piece of toast along with the tastiest cherry tomatoes i've ever had. 

So some of the things I disapproved of here was the climate in the building. It felt like it was 60 degrees forcing me to keep my coat on the entire time. The pizza had a great crust but the toppings were not that tasty and were very watery. On a thin crust pizza, a pool of water is the last thing you want. It was like eating a bread soup bowl. I think it's because of the water in the veggies and cheese but there has to be a way to fix that problem. After finishing our pizza we decided to grab some delicious looking gelato.

Even though it was 20 degrees out we ordered the ice cream. I grabbed 3 different flavors on a sugar cone which ended up being about $5. Somewhat disappointing because the cone was so small. I chose apple pie, somoa and blueberry cheescake. The blueberry cheesecake was definitely my favorite even though I was sure I would prefer the apple pie. The samoa was great too, tasted just like the girlscout cookie with a decent coconut flavor.

Our total bill was about $30 including tip which was ok but I wished the pizza would have been worth the $10 i paid for it. I don't know if I will be coming back here for the pizza but I will definitely return for some gelato."}
{"text":"Mercurio's makes great fresh pizza, I'm surprised it's not a busier place at night - perhaps a lot of people just get takeout? 
Try the della casa pizza if you like prosciutto - it was absolutely delicious! Not the most incredible pizza I've EVER had, but it was incredibly fresh so it's very high up on the list. It may seem a little pricey for a pizza, but it is also quite large, so take that into consideration - it's probably only a personal pizza if you've reached that critical HANGRY level."}
{"text":"Mercurio's is my go-to place in Pittsburgh for gelato. They frequently change their flavors which provides even more incentive for me to go back. When I went, I got a waffle cone with samoa and blue muffin gelato. The samoa gelato had every component of the samoa cookie and I could taste the shredded coconut. The blue muffin gelato tasted like a blueberry cheesecake which is my favorite type of cheesecake. There is absolute nothing wrong with their gelato and I will be going back as many times as possible."}
{"text":"Like this place! I ordered a margherita de bufalo pizza and it was so delicious, perfectly made, non greasy and fresh! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the Margherita pizza...best I've had in Pittsburgh.  The gelato is very good.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all....
The service is not good... It's not bad either.... The gelato... Ok people here it comes.... I know everybody raves about it....
But when you don't \"massage\" the gelato every day then it gets freezer burns and it does not taste the same!
That is just laziness....
The pizza.... Where is the cheese?!??!
In this case the mozzarella! I saw the pics so I actually asked for extra mozzarella.... 
I could barely find any .... 
These place needs work.... 
Good concept, though....."}
{"text":"Gelato, 5 stars. You have to try the Blueberry Muffin flavor because it is out of this world. Fresh berries and even little cinnamon streusel bits. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I love that you can order by the ounce instead of in pre-determined small, medium, large sizes. Obviously Mercurio's is known for their pizza and while I find it to be tasty and good, I'm not over the moon about it. I have tried the margherita, margherita with bufala, lasagna and something with prosciutto on my various visits. Despite the overall pizza being 'just okay', I think the crust is fantastic--slightly sweet, fresh and chewy without sitting in a blob in your stomach. I love Mercurio's to pop in to on off times, but don't think it is worth waiting hours for during peak times."}
{"text":"I am a bread/pizza crust/foccacio loving fool.  When I was younger, the thicker the crust, the more I loved the pizza.  I used to actually ask family members if they were going to eat their crusts and if not, could they give me their crusts. Weird, I know...  But a sea change occurred quite a few years ago.  One of my cousins mentioned that she didn't like thick crust pizza anymore and went on to describe why she didn't like thick crust anymore.  Well, that did it for me.  I know no longer like thick crust pizza. (Side note:  I used to also like huge chicken wings, but I no longer like them because of the way my aunt described why she no longer likes big chicken wings.  Hmmm, the power of suggestion.)

Anyway, Mercurio's pizza is the answer to me not liking thick crust pizza anymore.  I have been to Mercurio's several times and went initially at the suggestion of fellow foodie, Tim. W.  My daughter Muff had never been there, so we ordered the classic Margherita for her and I ordered the Italiano Panini sandwich with Capicola and salame, tomatoes, provolone, onion and extra virgin olive oil.  The sandwich was also served with a small side salad with small chunks of house made fresh mozzarella.
I shared a portion of my Panini sandwich with my daughter, Muff and she shared a portion of her pizza with me.  Ah, the pizza crust had a nice chew and held up the toppings nicely, but I also felt like I could devour an entire pie without feeling weighted down.  There must be some sort of alchemy that occurs when a well-made dough hits a wood fired oven.  The Itailiano sandwich had just the right amount of high quality ingredients and everything was well balanced in this sandwich.  There's nothing like eating a sandwich where the dressing is overly assertive, or the meat is plentiful but inferior or the bread doesn't stand up to the fillings. Yum, yum, yum! 

We didn't get any gelato this visit (I didn't want to drive all of the way across town with melting ice cream) but I have had it on previous visits it's deliciously sinful.  I must take Muff back for the gelato as she is a ice cream/gelato, Italian ice junkie.  I just wanted to get home quickly and be at one with my food because the wonderful weather that day made parking a contact sport.  I felt like a gerbil just circling round and round Shadyside.  However, if you get the chance to eat in, do so and just relax.  You may not want to linger too long, however, because the place gets crowded and other patrons will stare at you if you stay too long.

High quality ingredients prepared with extra care in an inviting space is treat that everyone should enjoy."}
{"text":"PIZZA DEL REY. I have not tried the gelato yet (gasp!). But the pizza is one of my favorites in the city. Again, PIZZA DEL REY. So amazing. I hate to seem all trendy and such, but damn, I love truffle oil.

The pizza crust is incredibly thin--almost too thin at times. It is not always crispy enough and can get quite soggy under all the toppings and cheese. But the crust has a nice, simple flavor.

The pizzas have fresh toppings and are fire-baked, so they come out quickly and (usually) cooked to perfection. The problem with those ovens, though, is sometimes spots of the crust are burnt while the rest is a little underdone.

They offer some wines and some beers, but it's not a very large selection. Likewise, the salads and sandwiches do not have a ton to offer, but I have not tried one yet, so I can't say anything about their quality.

I guess since they just semi-recently expanded to serve pizza, I will cut them a little slack for the lack of boozing options and limited food menu. I hope they expand a little to add more space and maybe pasta!

Service is always pleasant, but usually kind of slow. I guess that's ok because I am never in a rush if I sit down to eat there. I find it a little strange there is no host or anything because if you go in on a super busy night, you'll find yourself awkwardly in the way or seemingly standing in line for gelato. Meh. Oh well!"}
{"text":"I like Mercurio's! These are some unbeatable (although oddly chosen, with differentials down to the penny) prices for tasty pizza. The crust is thin and salted, and also nicely chewy. I would definitely come here to carb load before a race. 

The menu seems expansive but is only combinatorial, meaning that there are lots of different toppings that we've all thought about merging, i.e. the variety brings nothing new to the palette. Nevertheless, for its price and quality, I am very comfortable giving Mercurio's a solid 4. They make the pizza right! If they perhaps worked on their ambiance more (we sat in an area that as right next to the counter, which led to continuous traffic by our table for the duration of dinner), I could bump this to 5. Keep it up, Mercurio's!"}
{"text":"Cute ambiane. The professionalism behind the gelato counter? Not so much.

Hankering for some gelato after dinner at Girasole, we came to Mercurio's for dessert. They have a good variety of flavors, as well as the sorbettos. I asked one of the girls at the counter if I could sample some flavors. They give you so little to sample! I then asked another girl if I could sample another flavor and she too gave a teeny little scoop! Come on now...

I settled on the Tiramisu and the girl did a poor job scooping. It looked so sloppy, unprofessional, and the size of the scoop was also pretty small. Good tiramisu though, but beware of their stinginess. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Was here 10 months ago.  It was OK.  Nice to sit outside and enjoyed the peroni beer.  The pizza was ok.  The olives were *gasp* from a can.  But decided to return since it was nice weather and we wanted to dine outside.

Note, there is.no sign that says 'see waitress for seating.'  There was no line and an open table outside, and bustling waitresses walking around,  so we took a seat at a table.  After 10 minutes of the waitress walking by our table, never making eye contact.  I politelyn asked, 'are you our waittress?' She scowled , asked us if we checked in with the hostess.   We said we had not.  She sighed, said, 'ok, but next time check in,' never smiled or said 'welcome' or 'how can I help you,' or even 'hello.'  

Needless to say, we left and went to piccolo forno, where they are kind and welcoming and make good pizza.  

We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I go here with my friends all the time. I get the margarita pizza- it's simple but deliciousssss. The tomato sauce must be house made because it certainly doesn't taste like the sauce you get from the jar- therefore it's not salty and the red is a soft red but very flavorful. The toppings are drops of actual mozerella cheese not the packages frozen one. And there's always three to four leaves if Basil on the center of the pizza which is approximately 8-10 inches in diameter (I think). Their gelatos are also delicious! Such a variety of flavors and it's not too thick or sugary. It's a perfect casual dining place. Even a simple date."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! It is true oven fired pizza, which does leave some charred crust. I don't personally mind it, but my bf isn't a fan. Sometimes the charred flavor can overpower the otherwise simple ingredients. 

We've visited the restaurant in Shadyside several times. We love the different pizza combinations, my favorite is the basic margarita pizza. We also love all the gelato options. 

The outdoor seating is great and I've seen people dine with their dogs. The employees are friendly too. 

Most recently we've found them at events such as Little Italy Days. I love that it's fresh and high quality ingredients. I also give the people working major credit, we were so hot, I can't imagine how hot they were next to the pizza oven! They were still friendly though and had a smile on their faces!"}
{"text":"If your in the mood for some good Neapolitan Pizza from the brick oven...M's is a good place.  The pizza's are handmade with very tasty ingredients including San Marzano tomatoes.  The Margherita pizza did not disappoint.  The crust was thin and crisp on the edges but soft in the middle.  

Why 3 stars.  The poor waitress, one, had a lot of tables and was falling behind but very mindful and stopped to check on us,   Finally, received some assistance from someone from the basement kitchen but it was just to slow.   The salads and Gelato looked great...so next time."}
{"text":"Mercurio's now has a brick over, so any of you that remember it in its past location, atop Girasole, may be wonderfully surprised to know that you can now get the most authentic Italian-style pizzas in the Burgh at Mercurio's new locale.  I was extremely impressed with the new pizzas, as they are definitely the closest thing I have found in Pittsburgh to an authentic Napolitan pizza.  The brick oven is even imported from Naples.

The mozzarella is fresh and homemade too, and if you have ever tried fresh mozzarella on pizza, you certainly know the difference.

The gelato here is fantastic as well - best in the city, and all homemade.  There are too many flavors that sound delicious for me to try, so I will certainly be back for more.

FYI, last time I ordered the pizza topped with arugula (my favorite pizza topping ever) and finished with the Lemon Basil gelato.  Yum."}
{"text":"Was very happy when this place finally opened. Walnut Street has been lacking in decent restaurants, with the exception of Girasole. The pizza is pretty good. They also have a nice selection of salads which are interesting and big enough to share. Nice to have a decent glass of wine with your pizza as well. 

I think the outside seating is best, the inside can be somewhat cramped and a little odd with the people standing in line for gelato, which, By the way is fantastic."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and the gelato!  We had such a great experience here. You can tell that the owners deeply care. It tastes like you're in Italy!"}
{"text":"After trying pizzas from various places in the Burgh, this place provides the best experience. The basic margarita pizza is filled with so much flavor and try and combine this experience with a cappuccino or a gelato!"}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of Mercurio's since the first time I visited.  I'm surprised I didn't get to writing a review about it in the time I lived in PGH. Better later than never, I guess. Let's talk about Mercurio's in its latest location reincarnation. The quality of the gelato is superb, and I haven't disliked one flavour I've tried. Personally, I like the texture and the flavour punch of gelato better compared to its sister, ice cream. Some of my favourite flavours at Mercurio's are: lemon basil, chocolate hazelnut (Nutella), raspberry chocolate chip, and the dark stracciatella. Seriously, you can never go wrong with Mercurio's. The people that work there are super friendly too, and it's a family-run business. I'm glad they moved to this spot right on Walnut, but they have a lot of traffic during the hotter months no matter where they are located. Try it out if you're ever in the Eastside."}
{"text":"The pizza and salads here are DELICIOUS. The crust is delicious cooked to perfection in their brick oven, and the toppings are so fresh. Even better, it's awesome to finish your delicious meal with some perfect gelato. The consistency here is excellent. We love this place!

GLUTEN-FREE PIZZA Update:
I've missed the pizza with the gluten allergy so I was extremely excited about the gluten-free pizza. Available on Mondays and Tuesdays. It's nearly impossible to get good gluten-free baked goods, and pizza is one of the hardest. I've heard Mercurio's has worked to perfect the recipe, but it wasn't quite right. Unfortunately, the extremely thin layer of toppings and liquidy sauce they use for the regular pizzas just do not work with this crust. As soon as it starts cooling, it's gets watery and rubbery and between bites of toppings, there's too much exposure to the crust. I hope they keep working on it because I'm still looking for good gluten-free pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Last time I paid this place a visit it seemed like it was incredibly crowded, but fortunately for us it was just the crowd for gelato and not for dinner. After waiting in line for about 5 minutes we were seated inside (it was a little chilly outside), and the server swiftly introduced herself and brought us water despite them being so busy.

We ordered the half carafe of house wine along with a Fungui pizza to share. The pizza was perfectly cooked, nice and crispy and the toppings were just delicious and you could taste the freshness of the pizza. The crust was thin enough to hold all the topping without falling appart. You didn't even need additional mozzarella. Just awesome. The service was very attentive and brought our checks as soon as we asked. 

Overall this place is consistently good and would look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Mercurio's pizza is so good, baked in a wood fired oven!  And they have the best Gelato so many flavors.    They have nice outside seating also!  I love to sit outside and have a glass of wine and watch the people go by while I'm waiting for my pizza! We love to go to shadyside and take our dog with us for a walk, its real dog friendly there. And I love to eat outside at Mercurio's when I have my dog with me!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch with a friend. I had the pizza del re and my friend also had a pizza. The pizzas were delicious. The crust is nice and thin. The truffle made the pizza absolutely incredible! They are on the pricier side, but worth it! We then had to have gelato. I had the honey sea salt gelato and wow was it amazing. The gelato was creamy, but still light and refreshing. A great place in Shadyside to grab some pizza or gelato. I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"My first time and I went around noon on a Sunday, so no line or wait. Their pizza is unique and delicious with a largely vegetarian menu and no poultry. I ordered the eggplant one and it was good! I took the rest home to eat but it wasn't the same reheated obviously. I'll be back to try the dessert soon!"}
{"text":"My friends and I popped in here on a Saturday afternoon for gelato. We tried pistachio and caramel - both excellent! Gelato is generally on the pricier side, so it's what you would expect (3.75 for a small). Though we didn't eat meals, the pizzas being taken to the tables around us all looked and smelled great. I liked the casual ambience at Mercurio's and will definitely return to try their food. Great location on Walnut."}
{"text":"Went with the mushroom and sausage pizza, with extra cheese which was phenomenal. The crust was light and was a perfect texture.  Great sauce as well. For dessert, I tried the Nutella pizza. Also amazing. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very authentic Naples style pizza and gelato. Love this little slice of Italy in Shadyside!"}
{"text":"I saw the sign for this delightful gelato shop after dinner one night and rushed in (even though my pasta fish dish was enough to feed 3!). I was glad I did. I caught them during the end of the day but the friendly staff was still glad to serve me. 

I sample of everything, I shouted. A few of their daily flavors include: Butter Pecan (No Sugar Added),  Banana Strawberry Swirl, Blueberry Muffin, Chocolate Marshmallow, Coconut Cream Pie, Cookies n Cream, Dark Chocolate Stracciatella, Death By Chocolate, Fior di Latte, Gianduia, Hazelnut, Key Lime, Lemon Sorbetto, Mango, Mint Chocolate Chunk, Mulberry Cream w/ Chocolate Chunks, Peanut Butter Cup, Pistachio, Raspberry & Truffles, Strawberry Cheesecake, Tiramisu, Vanilla Custard, Dulce De Leche, Birthday Cake, and Caramel Latte --- but that's not all! There is another listing of Rotating Flavors for you to enjoy!"}
{"text":"After discovering that Mercurio's reopened on Walnut St since closing their Copeland St location, I have been there twice in the last week which is huge as I am or think that I am not a huge ice cream/gelato/frozen yogurt eater. The two flavors I had were splendid - blueberry muffin and peanut butter cookie dough in cones. The space is empty which I think they have plans to fill in and it feels uncomfortably warm in the store but as long as my stomach is satisfied I intend to continue indulge myself for the unforeseeable future. I am hooked!"}
{"text":"Everyone loves the gelato,but this place has the best pizza in Shadyside!  Small restaurant with a friendly neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"My mom and I dined here because I had purchased a groupon.  I feel like Mercurio's menu can appeal to almost anyone (pizza, gelato, and wine...how could you go wrong?!).  In addition, we loved the atmosphere!  Our waiter was knowledgable and helped us with suggestions.  We ordered the pizza del re because I love truffle oil, and it was so good! I'm not normally a big fan of crust, but in this case I was.  My mom was too stuffed between the pizza and the wine to order gelato, but I couldn't pass it up.  They had a pretty big variety of flavors that made my choice tough, but I went with the tiramisu.  It was awesome! I think I'll be paying them another visit soon!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible. I've taken multiple friends/family here and they all can't wait to return. The service is always great and I love the selection of gelato available. Recommendation - don't leave without getting the blueberry muffin gelato. It might be the best this ice ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Independent ice cream and gelato shops are always intriguing with some of the creativity that can go in their flavors. With an enormous array of flavors like blueberry muffin, apple pie, and cinnamon bun, figuring out which flavor to get is difficult as getting a sample of 42 flavors would be a faux pas. I opted for the apple pie on a sugar cone and came out happy with a creamy ice cream with cinnamon and chunks of pie crust and apples. It was a perfect treat while strolling around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We've always had great pizza, salads, and gelato at Mercurio's. Tonight? Not so much. We were seated at an outdoor table, given menus, and forgotten. Twice I tried to get the attention of one of the waitstaff. Both looked right through me. After 15 minutes of waiting, I went inside and returned the menus. They clearly were not interested in my business."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far. Once for the pizza, and once for the gelato. Both in the same night seemed like dairy overload.

The pizza was pretty flavorful, but I was very disappointed with how watery it was. Since I've only had it once, it could certainly be due to the particular ingredients that came on my pizza. The crust seemed properly cooked and everything - but there was just too much water on top.

I quite like that they use the hotter-than-hell-flash-cook method for cooking the pizzas. I much prefer the thin crust and nice charred taste that it provides compared to the thick crust baked wonderbread taste.

The gelato was all delicious. Nice selection of flavors.

The staff was very friendly as well. I'll definitely be back to see about getting a slightly drier pizza. Hopefully they can get bumped up a star or two if they deliver."}
{"text":"This review is based on the pizza.  I tried the Romana, and in my opinion it was not up to par.  The toppings weren't either flavorful enough or plentiful enough (either would work, and you CAN have one but not the other) to carry the overpowering taste of chewy bread that is the crust.  There was also a presence of a burned flavor over part of the pizza.  Mind you, the pizza was not burned - it actually looked well cooked, but this 'flavor of burned' flavor somehow came from some place and permeated the crust of this pizza.  Not the 'good burned' either, but rather the kind of bitter, acrid wet-wood-smoke taste.  I've eaten worse things, but I don't think I'll be back to Mercurio's for pizza.

The gelato looked good.

Service was friendly, and I don't knock the servers or wait staff for anything...  but to management:  One register, and shared with the gelato stand?  That's no good.  Also, I could tell there was an issue with organization.  Staff were good people, but there's something about the system in place which seems to cause unnecessary wait times, and some confusion.

If I factored in parking and trying to 'get there' on a Wednesday night, I'd take all the stars away, because while some people might like hanging out in that part of town, I found it to be a hassle.  I am NOT factoring that in to my rating (2 stars for the food...  taste vs. expectations, period, and for me it was as I mentioned sub par this night).  I had to take multiple turns and avoid or accommodate negligent pedestrians left and right, and finally parallel park, which I guess in the city just means 'park'.  When it comes to food, I would like to order food, go to pick it up, park, and do that.  Here, I had to search for parking, and it wasn't a pleasant experience.  I'll walk a couple of blocks, but this was ridiculous.  Compared to other places I've been to and done this in Pittsburgh, this ranks high on my 'most annoying to get to' list.

In short, if you want pizza, there has got to be a better way to get what will probably be better pizza.  That's what this review is about.  No hard feelings.  Thanks for showing me what you got, and if I ever come back it will be for ice cream (or gelato, and I'll be holding up the register for frustrated call in pizza orderers and dining room guests...)"}
{"text":"I had the prosciutto pizza, my fiance had the calzone. Both were very good! The sauce tastes fresher and you can tell it's more authentic. Our food was hot and the gelato was delicious. If you want better service, it's probably better to sit inside, however. The waiter took our order and gave us our drinks and didn't return until after we finished eating. It would have been nice to have a refill before the check came but the food was still delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the biggest problems with this place is the fact that they won't allow you to build your own pizza. You can only order the options on the menu and the pizzas are loaded with sauce and little cheese, plus the crust was burnt. The drink glasses were so small I had to keep asking for refills and our experience was not very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great selection of ice cream--I'm a big fan of the black cherry and caramel latte.  Pizzas and salads are great--I always ask that they make my crust 'crisp' or else the make it to gooey and soggy for my liking.  Location is excellent and the staff nice."}
{"text":"Bianco pizza with proscuitto and a margarita pizza. I may have found the best pizza in Pittsburgh. From the salad with proscuitto and panini bread to the Bianco pizza to the death by chocolate gelato ... I am smitten. So many flavors that my mouth was literally watering for each bite. I didn't want it to end. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Mercurio's is a small pizza and gelato joint in Walnut Street. It can get packed, but you can order to go if you're not up for the wait. Some of my favorite dishes are their perfectly seasoned House salad and the salsiccio pizza. They also have some delicious white pizzas for those who aren't a fan of/can't have red sauce. 

The gelato is a whole separate story over here. It's so hard to choose, but thankfully you can sample the flavors to make your decision easier (or harder, because they're all freaking delicious). Some of my favorites are the dulche de leche and the blueberry muffin."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love gelato? Honestly to me it's better than ice cream especially when it's coming from an establishment that really knows how to make it. Salty caramel is the one I really like. There's a nice selection of flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are Neopolitian pizza snobs. I simply love a super-thin-crust brick-oven pizza (with amazing cheese!). Mercurio's brought be back to the days when I studied abroad in Italy at the first bite! I've searched and found some favorite restaurants over the years, but I'm pretty sure this place tops them all. I've raved about it so much that I think my fiancé and I are going to plan a return trip to Pittsburgh (We live in Seattle!) just so he can try it! PS - order the buffalo mozzarella - It is better than I ever hoped to be able to find in the states! I just wish this pizza was available somewhere closer to home! Maybe the owners will consider a franchise?!"}
{"text":"I love gelato!

Went here before heading to the airport and it was as good as usual.

I am particularly fond of their key lime gelato which is a great mix of sweet, sour, and tangy.  Other than that I found that the dulce de leche was a bit too sweet, but overall I really like gelato and this is a great place to get it."}
{"text":"I'm truly so thankful for Mercurio's in my new gluten free lifestyle. I honestly never thought I'd have good pizza again! THANK GOD for this fantastic gluten free pizza! 

Currently they only offer it Mon-Wed. I would hope that word would spread and they'd extend it to other days, but I assume it's just costly for them to make GF dough if it goes unused every day. But the dough... That's the main issue with GF pizza. Mercurio's pizza crust tasted exactly like regular dough. I couldn't tell the difference, I swear to you!

I never thought I could get my fave del ra pizza again. Again, thank god I could! I'm so excited to come back when I have a hankering for pizza. I only wish they were closer to home. But it's worth it to make the extra trip!"}
{"text":"Neopolitan pizza is not like other pizza, so Mercurio's food will not suit everyone.  That being said, the pizza tastes exactly as Neopolitan ought to--chewy in the middle and browned /crispy on the crust.  It's light on the cheese and toppings, so it tastes much healthier than other pizza.  

I've had the Fungi, Primavera, Prosciutto, and Regina(?)/Bufalo mozzarella pizzas, and my clear favorite is the Regina/Bufalo mozzarella pizza.  Given how delicate and flavorful the Bufalo is, I agree with another reviewer that it would be nice if they allowed you to switch the house-made mozzarella with the Bufalo on other pizzas.  The simplicity--while usually delightful--can occasionally translate into blandness; for that reason, I like Il Pizzaiolo slightly more-- it has more options. Another thing that makes Mercurio's feel authentically Italian is the reasonably priced and tasty glasses of house wine.  

I have to mention the Caprese and Prosciutto Paninis-- these are so big, filling, and flavorful, with gooey mozzarella and balsamic vinegar!  They come with a side salad or soup, so this is almost the better option if you're really hungry and wanting some melty comfort food. 

Given that the restuarant has a popular gelato shop right in the middle of it, it's more of a lunch or a casual dinner place--don't go expecting an intimate, romantic setting.  If the hubbub bothers you, you can always wait a few minutes extra/ request a table in the back section away from the gelato line.  And Yeah; Dulce de Leche gelato is sooo delicious.  

The more I have Mercurio's pizzas, the more I crave them.  I'm definitely trying the Pizza del Re next time."}
{"text":"Took the family out for dinner last weekend and had a great time! We love this place... We've been here many times and consistency is the keyword here. The food is always good and the service is always friendly and the wait is never long."}
{"text":"My Italian friends maintain this place has the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Their crust is definitely on the softer side, so if you like a crispy pizza you may be disappointed, but it's full of flavor and topped with delicious sauce and cheese!

I love smoked anything, so my favorite is the Provola (basically a margherita  with smoked mozzarella). I have found I prefer not to order their pizzas with toppings: the first time I came here I had the Contadina, which I felt came with pitifully few pieces of eggplant. But if you stick with their simpler pizzas you can't go wrong

As for the gelato, I love how they have creative flavors, but the gelato doesn't quite have the density and depth of flavor that you find in the best gelato places. I will admit I have extremely high standards when it comes to ice cream, so perhaps I am being overly picky, especially considering how hard it is to find gelato at all in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Someone recommended Mercurio's to me yesterday and so I came in for dinner. The pizza is great! If you like brick oven pizza, you will enjoy this place. At the recommendation of our waiter, we ordered the Pizza Del Re, and also ordered the Primavera at our own volition. The Primavera was pretty good, but the Pizza Del Re was out of this world. All of the ingredients were great, but I think it was the truffle spread that put this over the top.

These pizzas can be a little tricky to eat without losing all of the toppings. We tried knife-and-fork plus the usually pizza-eating techniques, but found that the best way to eat it without making a mess is to fold the piece in half (so you are essentially creating another pie-shaped piece that is half the size). This keeps all of your toppings on and lets the \"juice\" seep out the back.

I tend to go to an unnamed (3-star worthy) frozen yogurt place just down the street when my sweet -tooth kicks in, but this will definitely be my new go-to. I tried the caramel latte and the pistachio, and if you are sitting down for dinner, your waiter/waitress can serve it for you so you avoid the line. 

I want to try to Salami pizza next and there are a few more gelato flavors that I was tempted by, so I'm sure I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Perfect amount of sauce, perfect amount of cheese, delicious crust and great toppings... Then there's the gelato. Great flavor a and great selection. 
Officially my favorite place for pie."}
{"text":"In every scoop of Mercurios Gelato there are over 13+ years of research, study, testing, obsession and love in their dozens of freshly made daily offerings.  Mrs. Mercurio and her husband took endless culinary workshops and university courses studying every aspect of ice cream and gelato production and you can experience the fruits of their labor in every taste.  They recently added pizza to their offerings.

The Mercurio's son trained at an authentic Sicilian pizza shop and they had an italian pizza oven imported to give an authentic product.   While many rave about the pizza at piccolo forno in lawrenceville, I found Mercurios to be much more authentic (and delicious) compared to the pizza I had in Italy.  The pizza dough is paper thin and savory (almost like crepes) the toppings are all fresh, generously administered and the crust is perfectly crispy.

The raw brick walls and black and white photos of italy complement the atmosphere and the staff were all extremely friendly and enthusiastic.  I'm not normally a huge Gelato or Pizza fan, but Mercurio's does not offer normal gelato or pizza.  They are the finest example of both I've tasted in Pittsburgh, I look forward to many more happy meals and desserts here, Mercurios has made me a believer!"}
{"text":"Raspberry & Truffles...yes please!  Mercurio's definitely ranks as the top gelato shop in Pittsburgh.  They have tons of flavors, and each and everyone is delicious.  I also appreciate that you pay by weight, and the prices are reasonable.  They let you sample unlimited flavors until you decide, def a nice perk.  I haven't had a chance to try their pizza yet, I hoping it's just as good as their gelato."}
{"text":"Yummy too many to chose from so I had two key lime sorbet and mango coconut sorbetto yumm"}
{"text":"Been here many times and the food is great, but 9 times out of 10 it takes excessively long - even when ordering takeout. Considering the type of food they serve and the atmosphere here this is frustrating most of the time."}
{"text":"Great pizza if you dig real pizza! Just like Europe! Big ups!"}
{"text":"OMG, 42 gelato flavors!! Every other gelato place I know max out at about 12 flavors, haha. If I was living in Pittsburgh about now, I would so go on Mercurio's Gelato Journey and try a different flavor every time I was there... and that's not just because I'm trying to escape the hot and humid Pitt summer. 

Fiancee and I each got a medium: hazelnut and peanut butter... at under a dollar per ounce. Very good gelato, and open until quite late. I'm under the impression that they're open as long as Girasole downstairs is. (Italian ice cream after an Italian dinner, anybody?) Quite awesome.

I'll definitely be back. It calls for at least another 41 visits from me."}
{"text":"A scoop of cookies and cream with a scoop of confetti hit the spot on a 75 degree summer evening!  Oh man was it good.  I like it when my ice cream actually tastes like something other than opaque ice, and this did for sure!  I wasn't quite sure what the confetti was going to be flavored like when I ordered it, thinking maybe cake batter but it looked good so I got it anyway, and after about 3 bites I could tell it was flavored like that confetti cake mix (or is that stuff flavored after something even else?)!   Flavor!  I want to go back a million more times to try them all!"}
{"text":"Small pizza place on Walnut. I used yelp's join the line feature and we didn't have to wait in the line on a Saturday night. Great start....but I recommend requesting for a door that is not close to the front door especially on cold weather days. 

Our waiter was helpful in explaining the items on the menu. The wait time for food was not long, maybe around 10 minutes for each of the items we ordered. 

We ordered bruschetta for starters and pizza Roberto 
The crust was softer and bigger than the typical crostini used for bruschetta. I recommend trying this. Pizza is good quantity for 2 people consisting of 4 big slices. It is a thin crust pizza.  Cheese is the center of attraction for the pizza Roberto. The main flavors were basil and grape vine tomatoes. We ordered this to try the Barretta cheese. The crust was soft, fresh and airy. I never had a soft crust like this one. 

They offer a aariety of gelato flavors. I got the tiramisu and vanilla. Everything was great except for the fact that they gave 75% vanilla and 25% of tiramisu instead of half and half. That was disappointing since I was expecting equal quantities of both. 

I recommend this place if you are looking for some fresh flavorful pizza and of course their famous gelato is worth the visit."}
