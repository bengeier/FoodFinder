{"text":"Worst !! Don't go !! Me & my wife went over there the other night !! Not even busy they ran out of glasses for my beer apparently !! Are you kidding !! Food was overdone & crap !! NO DO NOT GO !!"}
{"text":"This place looks like it has everything going for it for a sports bar. Dozens and TV's, and a huge screen above the bar, lots of room and a patio with Deer Creek golf course in view. However, these guys have NO idea how to run a sports bar when there are major sports events going on.  Last year we were there for the Stanley Cup final. They had the Jays on the big screen, and NO hockey game at all on the other small TV's. Our waitress understood and tried to get the mgr to change the TV. She was told that 2 guys asked for the Jays on the big screen. We were 8, and we asked the guys around us and all wanted hockey. The mgr refused. We were about to leave when the owner showed up and changed the big screen. He seemed upset about it, but still his mgr had no clue how to deal with this. We were there May 10 for the Leafs big game. This time, they tuned EVERY TV in the place to the game. That was fine, but there were two other playoff games and a Jays game going on. We asked the waitress why some of the small TV's couldn't have the other games and she said she'd talk to the mgr. It wasn't until the second period started that the Rangers game came on a few TV's. Shortly after the Jays came on some other TV's. Never did see the Red Wings game on any of the TV's. So again, with all the options they have to show all the big events going on, they had no idea how to deal with it.  I give it two stars since the waitresses have all been pretty good. Food is very average and they don't really seem to care. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great Place to watch a game, but the owner \"AL\" is a total ass.  He has no customer service skills and is always yelling at his staff.  Very unprofessional, Stay clear of this place."}
{"text":"I was there last with 9 friends for drinks, huge place, lots of staff, no customers. We probably spent $300. Our server was nice, but the bartender was stuck up...just like the owner...attitude.   I can't see them lasting too long.  Would never suggest my fellow friends"}
{"text":"I had gone here with my friend to watch a basketball game. We had ordered wings and fries. When the wings came they did not have hardly any sauce on them so we asked the waitress for more, which and brought. Upon biting into the wings they were very dry and tasteless. The waitress was no where to be seen or did not come by the table to ask how we were doing.. For almost 2 hours! When we finally caught her attention we told her that we did not eat the wings and she said we didn't have to pay for them... Without offering to bring us something different.. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"The manager is the best host in the biz _ the girls are cute and friendly _ good food, great chef and fair prices"}
{"text":"The food is substandard at best and the service during our latest visit was slow and almost non-existent. I expect management to deal with being shorthanded. When I don't see a waitress In our section much less at our table for over an hour that's really bad."}
