{"text":"Awesome sarso saag n makki roti...delicious kathi roll...reasonable ..what more to ask! Must try"}
{"text":"Hands down this business lives up to its name.  1 -  Customers are treated like kings 2 -  food prepared fresh  3 -  price is right 4 -  clean  Bad part: The place had a aroma of some sweet type spices. Was not bothersome but was definitely odd. But regardless i wont use this to deduct a star."}
{"text":"We took out food from here and got a few things.   Pani puri - The pani puri mix contained onions, potatoes and canned chick peas. Despite of canned chick peas other items do not go with puri.    Kati roti was made of white tortilla. The vegetables mix inside the roti were extra salty but tasteless.  I am not sure why they would take shortcuts in preparing food when their primary business is to prepare food.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Yes, service could be better but this is legit Indian street food. I had samosa chaat, pav bhaji and dahi badha. Everything tasted delicious.  It was $19 tax in, which is not bad at all. I would recommend!   Come on guys, it's been open for 6 months and I think we can cut them some slack for service. This is definitely a family run business!"}
{"text":"We order take out for our markham Healthplex dental and pharmacy in the  neighbourhood - they make awesome subjis ( veg curries ) specially their Chana masala ( chick pea ) - ask for Inder the chef !!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim. In a nutshell- give it a try for flavourful Indian snacks/apps. I didn't regret it.  It's not a fancy place - it's a no frills place with tables and chairs.  I remember tasting amazing pav bhaji on a trip to India years ago. And I love any sort of street food.  The chaat papri here was so good, the balance of the yogurt, tamarind, mint, chaat spices and pomegranate seeds with the crunchy 'chips' was good!  The pav bhaji (bread and mashed mix veg curry) was so good and they even put a pad of butter. Melted goodness sprinkled with onions and lime.  The kulcha was also good- hadn't tried that before. Kind of a 'loaded' naan with spices and etc.  I haven't tried any of the Parathas or etc- from what I tried so far, we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We love Indian/Punjabi food and one of the main reasons we love Toronto. We are regulars at Rajdhani, Brars and Bengali Sweets at Islington & Albion. Only thing we don't like are those places are pretty cramped and a bit far for us as we live closer to Scarborough. So when a Friend  mentioned about this new Punjabi place in Markham, we were excited to try a new Punjabi Restaurant after a long time. Boy were we wrong!!   Decided to go for lunch on Family day, arrived around 1pm, the place was totally empty, except for a couple who I guess were the owners were sorting some posters on the dining tables.  Half the lights were off. Guess these signs should have been enough reason for us to walk out but we were starving so decided to give it a shot.  We both decided to get the Thali's,  For $6.99 all you get is 2 Subzis (the only Paneer option is Mutter Paneer, the rest  are just basic like Daal, Palak, Channa, Aloo Baingan), 2 Rotis, Rice, Raita and pickle. NO DESSRT. The Subzis were NOT enough for the Rotis, let alone the Rice. The Daal was more Water than anything else. Some of the worst Punjabi food we have eaten in Toronto. SO DISAPPOINTED!! Never going back here again.   Still trying to understand why they would cover up all their windows with the same posters instead of letting the natural light in thru at least some of the windows. Guess they don't want people seeing the empty tables. Did I mention they finally decided to turn all the lights on half way thru our meal. Lastly if I wanted to hear Shabad Kirtan during my meal I would go the Gurudwara, not a Restaurant.   One star for the place being spacious and clean. One star for the food being made Fresh (I guess), based on the 20 minutes it took for them to bring the food."}
{"text":"Food was flavourful and fresh but the wait time for walk-in take out orders was too long, I think it was equivalent to staying home and cooking ourselves ."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday and I was craving Paneer. I ordered the Paneer Matar and garlic naan/butter naan. The lady said it was going to be 25 minute wait and I browse around the area.  The Paneer Matar was watery and wasn't enough spices. The garlic naan was burnt and there was too much fenugreek seed.  Gave a two star because it was edible and it didn't get me sick."}
{"text":"Came here tonight because I was getting pizza from Chunky Chicken, a few doors down.  My daughter wanted potato curry, so I walked in here to see if they had any.    There are a few tables to eat in but I wanted to get takeout.  I asked if they did potato curry, the guy said it was the weekend special.  It was AYCE potato curry for $7.99 but dine in only.  I asked if you had a dish of potato curry to go, he said no.  But in the end he said he could do me a pot to go with 6 roti.  I paid and went to Sunny Supermarket, picked up my pizzas and went back.  I had to wait another 10 minutes in the store.   The food itself was ok, but not enough potato.  Just don't come in here if you are in a rush.  I wasn't expecting the special of the day to take half an hour to cook, absolutely ridiculous.  I might return again, if I was in the area but driving up to Babu Babu would have been quicker than here.  Run by a nice family but it's not a very professional place."}
{"text":"Being vegetarians,  we love this place!  The food is always fresh, very tasty and tastes like home cooked food - no indigestion issues!  We've eaten here lots of times,  catered food for parties and the guests have always loved the food!  I would highly recommend the Punjabi dishes and their Hakka Chinese!!"}
{"text":"Best home made food with multiple options : snacking or full blown lunch. This is the best Indian food option in Markham.   The serviced is slow simply because everything is fresh !!!!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple times since....VERY SLOW SERVICE. Definitely need to improve that or they won't servive. Dissapointing that a thali takes 20 mins and the roti isn't fresh"}
{"text":"This is an excellent new Indian restaurant serving vegetarian \"snacky\" Indian food. We ordered Samosa chaat, Sarson Ka saag with makki ki roti and amritsari Kulcha. All very good with the latter being outstanding. Reasonably priced. Simple basic ambience - very basic but clean. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a no-frills Indian street food place ... The service is a bit slow ... but the food makes up for it ... Seems like everytime ( been there 3 times ) ... they make the food only after we order ... which is really awesome. The Makki ka roti and the saag is so yummy !  and so are the other things we ordered Pav Bhanji/Chole Bhatura/Aloo Tikki and so on.. Its authentic food this side of the GTA.... which is great!  Will definitely be back!  Note: The last time I was there got the Panneer burger... it was ok ... but i was freaked out by noodles inside the burger! So I would stay away from that!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for sometime,  finally made it here yesterday.  We came around 3:30 and there was one other couple there.  We orderd our food it took a while to come.    We only ordered two items.  1. Aloo paratha,  they come with yogurt and pickles, it's two big paratha which were good but really greasy.   2. Amristsari Kulcha, I've had this in saugga at the chat hut. and it was to die for. This one pales in comparison,  just because the other place is soo good. However still was good, but only comes with chana, and pickles. Otherplaces usually give yogurt,  chana, potatoes and pickles so this wasnt what I expected.  Overall I would go back"}
{"text":"Pros: -Variety of options if you are vegetarian -Food is not unpalatable!  Cons: -Service can be very slow at times. Probably not enough staff. -During the spring, the place got cold at times. They would keep one of the doors open for ventilation without heating!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Pav Baji and bhelpuri are my favourites here. Perfect for my chaat cravings."}
{"text":"super 100% vegetarian Punjabi restaurant . Chaats paratha Lassi so yummy. We tried chaat papri, Gobi paratha, salt Lassi, veggie thali in which we ordered bhindi curry and Rahma.. everything tasted great. Will come again for sure. Pure vegetarians must try"}
